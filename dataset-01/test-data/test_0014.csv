4,Charming story in Victorian style,"Charming story of a boy coming to grips with his mediumistic abilities in Victorian times. You will read his actual Journal, mispellings and all. Darn cute. If you are like me and have read many books on psychic development and stories about Mediums and spiritualism etc. you won't learn anything new from reading this but it is a pleasurable experience. If you feel no one understands you and your abilities then this may provide a bit of consolation. I liked it!"
2,Heavy Seas.,"I spent most of this movie asking why this ship wasn't moving in heavy seas.Then I spent a few minutes yelling at it.Highly predictable ""boo"" factor here.Telegraphed from the off.I happen to like mindless entertainment late at night.Sometimes I just watch a stoopid movie.Ten Little Indians did it better."
2,Slow and Boring,"I wasn't sure what the movie was about. Whether it was about someone trying to write a story, a man looking for answers or the ship itself. The plot and the storying line is a little rough or rather non existent. There is alot of paranormal stuff in the movie but very little is said to clarify what happened to the staff and passengers. There is alot left unsaid. The only reason I gave this film 2 stars is because of the sound. If you turn off your t.v. you can listen and imagine a better movie..."
2,It's ok.,"I thought these were going to be a lot of fun. However, when floating in the tub, you can't really stack the tubby tumblers. My daughter thinks they're ok, but she prefers plain old rubber ducks."
3,Good but single-minded introduction to PM,"This is a fine introduction to project management. Well-written and well-paced, it functions as a great starting point, but can be handy to have around as a general sourcebook refresher course as well.However, I only give this book 3 stars because of it's not an exaggeration to say that it is not much more than a printed and bound Powerpoint presentation. The entire book is a collection of bullet points upon bullet points. The sidebar tips and short chapter overviews are very nice, but mostly you learn from ordered lists.Would have been nice for reference if the authors had focused their fine tutorial writing skills into a balance between bullet points and more narrative formats.Still and all, despite its flaws I'd have to recommend it as the go-to book for the beginning project manager."
4,"Nice, but only by topics","The book has a lot of information regarding Project Management, but almost all is written by topics. It's difficult the learning, once you have lots of information without enough comments.One very nice chapter is about Microsoft Project; show a great collection of ""core essential information"", not only showing you how to make a simple schedule."
4,absolute beginners guide.,"It arrived on time.It was in good shape.My husband didnt care for the book itself. It did not apply to his business.Thanks, irma"
5,correction,"che was a revolutionary...a hero of the people, and if this guy above has ever picked up a history book, let alone spoken to anyone in south america he wouldn't be so ignorant. fyi-che was murdered by his former ""friend"" fidel castro, the real sociopath."
4,Should be a good read,"Hi! I'm a teenager that was in a small group (called a ""D""-group) in which Wendy was my leader. She's a very gifted writer and a strong Christian, and her books are fun to read and interesting. I would definitely recommend it."
2,A single card? Really?,"I guess I overlooked the 'sold individually' portion of this description and I swear they have elaborated since I ordered this, but I still gotta say: a single card? Really? For Bingo? If I order two how do I know I won't get the same two? Maybe that's the fun part, finding out. The item looks like the same card we had as kids. It's probably just as fun as I remember and as durable as cardboard can be. I'd love to write more, but I have to go play bingo against myself."
3,Car entertainment,Good game to keep children busy looking at the outside world instead of watching video and not aware of reality.
4,a moving romantic tradegy for the modern day greeks!,I saw this film a few years ago and have ever since been trying to find it again. It is touching in the most strangest way and the moment i finshed watching it i started again. It is wonderfully moving and deffinately worth a watch.
3,does the job just not so soft,"This product does what its supposed to do, yet its comfert level isn't very high. It isn't as squishy as the ones they had a few years ago when I potty trained my first son. All in all , it does what its supposed to and its a reasonable price."
4,Finally a potty that is not discarded with the other toys,I am not a mom who favors the fantasy potties being sold today. I believe a child potty training should be taught how to really use the bathroom. The fantasy potties have become toys to my son. This seat he loves. It stimulates his development because he recognizes his favorite characters plus it fits right on the toilet. He reaches for it puts it in place and has an interest in toilet training. I have paired this with some potty training videos and books. He loves to copy the videos. He brings a book to read while sitting on the potty. This seat has generated the most interest I've seen yet in my son and seriously potty training.
2,Disappointing value,"I own and have watched ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret"", and this DVD does not compare favorably. It depends too much on the graphics and music, which are admittedly great but which often overshadow the narration. The material is sometimes difficult to follow and is made more difficult by the lack of quality narration. The DVD doesn't get to the meat this buyer was expecting (2012 and the relation of the sun, the earth and mankind) until close to the end. And there is at least one serious digression (a comparison of the Egyptian god Horus to Jesus Christ) that while interesting, seemed to me to take more than its share of the DVD's short length. Harper's concepts are relevant, and it is urgent that they be communicated to mankind, but the packaging detracts from the credibility."
2,Can't Hear The Voice Track,"Once again a lot of hype for a very poorly mixed and edited film. I don't know what it is about these films that always falls short with the music/voice mixing. The music is way too loud and the voices are too faint. Not to mention, the music sucks. If there is any 'hidden' knowledge being presented, you'll have to wear headphones or constantly adjust the volume for the crappy music interludes. Why can't they pan the music to one side, the voice to the other, and hire an experienced mixing engineer for appropriate levels? My suggestion to this production company: Stick to the information and tone it down a bit on the unnecessary bells and whistles. Frankly, most of us just want to hear the info, and not be subjected to a bunch new age music and cheap transition effects."
5,with the best of them,"I saw this movie the day it was released in theatres...being a mystery buff I knew I had to see it. I literally sat for the full time and it felt like only ten minutes. This movie keeps you so wrapped in the plot you can not think of anything else. It is well paced and does not lull or become boring. My only complaint is that they did make a teensy mistake with the classification of multiple personality disorder, they stated it to be on the wrong axis of the DSM-IV. Would have thought that kind of thing would be checked.I do want to note that the Starz feature on the DVD and the directors comments are particularly notable if you are a film buff and if not. The diretor points out a lot of interesting lighting choices and camera angles that I would have never noticed without it being pointed out. Two thumbs up and if you are a mystery/suspence genre fan see this."
5,good film,"this movie was great, the plot was fantastic as well. im not gonna explain it to u people prolly becuase someone else did already. Amanda Pete is fine."
4,A clever thriller with one twist after another,"I admit I wasn't sure if I liked Identity when it was over. The performances are superb and the film is always engaging but the big twist I find clever yet disapointing at the same time. Part of me wishes it stayed focus as a horror/thriller about motel guests being targeted by a killer. In the 2nd act everything changes and I was both surprised and shocked but again disapointed like I said. It's still an extremely original, smart and creepy film though. It keeps you guessing and has one impossible to predict twist after another. If you like Identity I recommend Raising Caine with John Lithgow as well although it's not as good."
2,Disappointing.,"I'm a very big fan of movies that are suspensful and have a twist to them. But, this one was extremely disappointing. I won't be a jerk and give the ending away, but the movie itself was great up until the ending. I gave it two stars only because of the cast and the fine acting they did. The ending was sooooo dumb that I knocked down the 3 stars that would've gave it a 5!I don't recommend this movie at all and just want to say ""Rent"" it or wait 'til it comes on cable. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
4,"Scary, but you probably overlooked it","Very smart plot. You didn't think the killer was who it was and that they were all someones personalities. Not as scary as the ring, but it has some scary moments. I wondered how someone could think of something like that after I watched it. Looks very real and very cool camera angles. Makes you think when you watch it like clue"
2,"Disappointing--just rent ""Sybil"" instead","It's not schizophrenia in this movie, it's multiple personality disorder, which apparently affected the script. Although John Cusack's always watchable and the ""trapped strangers"" plot usually rustles up some general creepiness, this movie could have been a lot better even with a flawed premise."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I respect the fact that Identity tries to offer the audience something more than your standard slasher film, but **spoiler alert** multiple personalities is about the most cliched ""twist"" imaginable and all the pieces don't add up--Identity may be an interesting failure, but it's still a failure."
3,Mixed thoughts,"I did not feel that it was consistently good. When it ws good, it waas real good but when cold, not so good. The revelation I feel really takes away from the movie because it is such a cheap answer to the questions in the viewers mind. In spite of that I would have given it 4 stars if it were not for the very cheesy, cliche last scene.Most of what can be said (and shouldn't be said because it spoils the movie) has been said in other reviews. Overall, the film is well done in terms of acting and building suspense. But it loses a lot when the mystery is revealed."

4,Good movie- but note,This is overall a good film as long as you stay away from spoilers.I thought that the plot was very interesting but I found the ending to be slightly predictable- the person who ended up commiting the murders and the murder of someone towards the very end was something that I saw coming.Sort of a Spoiler Here- The plot twist of making the least predictable person the murderer has been played out already.
2,"Identiy, Truly Unidentifiable","Bad writing, choppy action, and horrible twists brings ""Identity"" down to levels of other awful psychological thrillers such as ""Abandon"" or even worse, ""American Psycho"". The film starts off with introducting the uniteresting ensemble characters one bye one such as John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and Ray Liotta who all give the worst performances of their carrer in this film. No real storry, and no real climax in this film it's just a redundant mix of gore and a suprise ending that doesnt seem to make much sence. The main theme of the film is skitzophrenia which hasn't been used well since 1999's ""Fight Club"" perhaps the best film of the generation. ""Identity"" will be a film without one in film history."
3,Above Average,"I really enjoyed 'Identity.' Although the movie did borrow from Shirley Jackson and Alfred Hithcock in a BIG way, it came across as more of a nod to those two greats as opposed to just ripping them off. I'm a big mystery/suspense fan, and this was really one of the better movies in the genre to come along in quite awhile. Well acted, interesting characters, good dialogue ... there's a lot of positives here.But man oh man, the ending would have been CLASSIC had the writer and the director just trusted themselves and not given away the plot twist halfway through the movie.A couple of extra snips in the editing room would have detracted from one character (I'm trying not to give away anything), and allowed the audience to identify more with the ten stranded hotel guests, as they should have been, experiencing the same paranoia and confusion they felt. It's really kind of a shame, they had so much positive momentum going and they just popped the cork on the whole thing WAY too early ..."
1,Identity crisis,"John Cusack is always great, Rebecca DeMornay's few minutes onscreen are well done, and Ray Liotta delivers as expected, but I'm really surprised they all agreed to work on this film. What a disappointment. Anytime you find yourself laughing when yet another character is murdered in some tired old horror movie fashion, it's time to hit the stop button. Even when you realize that everyone with a room key is going to die, it isn't suspenseful or even an issue because you don't really like them anyway, and they certainly don't care much about each other. The ""plot twist"" at the end is a total cop out and fairly predictable. (Wasn't it 20 years ago that Bobby dreamed an entire season of Dallas?) Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd watched the alternative ending(s), but the final version was more than enough for me."
1,I wish someone WOULD spoil the ending...,"...then I'd know what the heck happened. Did the guy kill himself 10 times, or what? How did he REALLY kill everyone. DID he kill anyone? Confusing.A lot or terror with no resolution. Unless no resolution is resolution. Psychobabble is right."
3,Confusing,"The movie really did keep my interest. It made you think and wonder who the killer is. The only thing is, you really do have to pay attention. If you aren't too bright you will get lost and the movie will be confusing! I had to watch some of it over again, and ask questions about this movie on various message boards lol. It gets very psychological! Other than that, it's very interesting, it has suspense, mystery, and thrills, with a solid cast! Definitely a watch!"
4,"Great Performance, but a cut-down of the live KING BISCUIT CD!","Jon Butcher was a tremendous rock guitarist/singer/songwriter who has now transformed into an equally tremendous bluesman. These recordings from the last years of his rock 'n' roll ""phase"" are a great testament to his amazing guitar style, resonant and expressive voice and songwriting abilities....BUT after a quick listen to this well-mastered CD, I realized it's just a cut-down of the KING BISCUIT live recording. So...if you can find the King Biscuit CD you will have a more complete concert. If not available, you still can't go wrong with this great slice of time in the career of one of the most underrated rock musicians of his era. P.S. this CD is mastered slightly louder than the K.B. concert CD and it sounds great. Would have given five stars if it were the complete concert."
3,Very funny for German natives,"If you already speak German, then this book is very funny. However, it is not something that a tourist should use. First of all, some of it does not even make sense, and second, some of it would be considered rude."
2,"sort of funny, but.....","I agree with the other reviewers who said this book really isn't a phrase book and doesn't belong in the language reference section. Anyone trying to really learn the language will be greatly disappointed.It does display a (sort of twisted) sense of humor. Parts of it really were funny. However, I failed to see where this humor came from a loving and appreciative place. To me, it all sounded pretty superior and judgmental. Satire is fine, but please at least convince me that you're satirizing something you have some appreciation for! The author failed miserably at this. I'm glad I checked it out at the library before buying, because I wouldn't want to waste my money on it!"
3,Escaping into Paradise,"Karen Blue has done a good job of describing why a number of women from various backgrounds were prompted to move to Ajijic, Mexico: a desire for change, a reaction to change in circumstances, a need for adventure. They find other English speakers, beautiful weather, a cooperative local community, and a way to stretch their dollars. One can't avoid the reality that the Mexicans are the servant class for the Americans, which must prick the conscience a little, but this is not acknowledged as a concern by anyone. Most of the people interviewed are focused on their own need for self-discovery, with Mexico as a sympathetic backdrop. Karen Blue is a perceptive observer, at least when it comes to the Americans she interviews. She writes well and with humor."
4,"Camera is good, the leather case was moldy","I just got the camera today.The camera itself works well, I am shooting my first roll of film. I will add more to this review when I get the film developed.The leather case that comes with the camera was moldy. Quite moldy. This is pretty disappointing given that I paid almost $500 for this thing. I cleaned it with 70% ethanol and hopefully the mold will not come back. I would have sent it back, but you can't send only the case back. And I do love this beast of a camera."
5,We love this!,Huge fans of these 2 movies. Old time classics! Good quality. Have watched them both probably a half dozen times now. Always fun.
4,Caught In This,Her expression is so vivid and imaginative. She is full of so much energy and color. How can you not like or relate to this song. 2thumbs up!
4,how many more,i doubt that manic hispanic can make more than maybe one more album after this one before they start really sucking. Similar to the gimme gimmes they are just running out of material. This album maybe be the last one that has more than a couple of good songs on it. To be Mijo goes to jr. college is probably their best with the recline and menudo incident tied for second right behind mijo.This is probably their worst effort yet it is still extremely enjoyable. I do think that some of their skits are hit or miss especially after repeated listening. I would get mijo or the recline first before getting into this one.To be honest despite my harsh criticism they are honestly one of the best punk bands around and this cd has to be on a top 5 list for punk band releases in 2005. I just don't think its up to the level of their previous albums still very good though.
1,bad product,"I used it one time, placed it on the charger and it never worked again. Now I face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair.Not happy with my internet purchase from your company."
1,Not Worth The Price!,"I bought this shaver based upon the reputation of Wahl supposedly being good quality. I didn't mind paying over $60.00 for a decent quality shaver. I am terribly disappointed!The construction is of light, cheap plastic. It does not have a solid feel to it. I could have lived with that if it gave a good shave. After charging the shaver for the required time I tried it out. It sounds like a lawnmower. It vibrates almost as much as the 5 hp vibratory plate compactor I use to compact stone with! My hand and face were both numb from the intense vibration after I finished shaving. As I went over parts of the jaw bone I felt my teeth tingling from the vibration.It gave an okay shave. I've had better from a $20 Remington AND without the discomfort the Wahl gives!This is going back.Save your money and get something else."
3,ok,This item didn't work as well as I thought it would. It didn't provide a good shave. I had to use my old flippers to finish shaving.
4,Close Shave ... but,"The Wahl 4000 electric razor I purchased through Amazon comes with 3 shaving screens. I have been using the one for the closest shave. It has been comfortable to use and closer shaving than the Norelco I was using before. I have been very pleased with the results.My only disappointment has been with the side trimmer (for use with trimming side burns, etc.) It is not easy to use without pulling hair. And it is not as effective in trimming as other razors I have had.If you don't need the side trimmer, this razor is the best I have ever had -- more like a ""blade-close shave"" than any other razor I have owned."
4,solid performer,Does a decent job. Not as close as a blade. Has a hard time with hairs at the neck line that don't grow in a uniform direction. No irritation whatsoever.
1,NOT SAME ITEM AS SHOWN,I am a religious shopper of Amazon and have NEVER been more disappointed. The item in the picture is not the item that was delivered to my home. The nipple is much longer and not flat as shown in the picture. This is false advertising and I would not recommend going through with your purchase of this item.
1,kinda angey,so i ordered these bottles that are shown in the picture right so you would think that you get getting what are are looking at you do in stores you should on line well when i got my package it was not what i ordered why would i spend this much money on this bottle when i can get in in store for so so much cheaper . my daughter is 3 months old and im a ful time breast feeder well i just recently went back to work havent found any bottle that hve worked a friend let me try hers out like the one shown in pictures and its the only thing she will take so i tried to get my own i had to leave work 3 days in a row tahts every day since i have been back just to feed cuz i had to reorded the bottles adn they are still not what i had ordered i talked to the ladies at amazon and now they are saying the picture is wrong . dont order these if you want square top nipples you will reciever round squar top nipples are very hard to find and you will not find them here
5,"A ""must have"" for all Spice' fans!","Its like the producers of this video read my mind! This video gave me so much more than what was expected! A close look at each girl. It even made me cry! This video is the finishing piece to any Spice Girls video collection. It really takes you everywhere they go, and talks to them like you've known them your whole life, and you smile the whole time just wanting to hug 'em all! They are the best band and this is the best Spice Girls video I've ever bought! I really mean that."
4,FINALLY ANOTHER SPICE GIRLS VIDEO TO ENJOY!!,"This video cronicles the Spice Girls American tour. It shows the girls going from city to city. It would be a five star video if it had more performances in it. THey show very brief performances of If You Cant Dance, Say You'll Be There, Two Become One, Who Do You Think You Are?, Stop, Move Over, Viva Forever, The Lady is A Vamp, Goodbye, and Step To Me."
3,Cute book for Spanish students and native speaking kids,"My mother told me my step-father was finally learning Spanish, so I purchased this for him as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, his Spanish studies went nowhere, but I did get to share the book with my children, who are both learning Spanish. While the text was simple enough for a 9 year old to follow, it simply didn't have the same rhythm, charm, and cuteness that the English versions of the ""Mouse"" books. Illustrations are nice, however, and my kids enjoyed it."

5,The Woman's Study Bible,"I have owned one of these for about 3 years now and find it to be one of the BEST Study Bibles I've ever opened. Our Sunday School Class does indepth studies of the Bible and I am always able to share something from here each Sunday. So much so, that I have given these as gifts to several of our friends, and they are studying the Word of God in depth now. Makes me smile."
3,Lips of Blood,"This run-of-the-mill slice of 70's exploitation declares its style early on when one of the female leads comes down the stairs stark naked saying ""Now where did I leave my skirt?"" Nudity in abundance is the purport and it sets out to deliver, ensuring that skin is amply displayed as the loopy gothic plot unspools.It's locked solidly into the style of the genre. The acting is oppressive, the special effects consist mainly of blood capsules, and the plot is a contrivance to hang the nudity on.It's of passing interest that the cast includes some losers of French X-rated movies in supporting roles."
4,bronson,"I liked the movie when it was originally in theatres and always had a fascination with the characters charles bronson chose to play. This particular movie gives an insight to what may have been the attitudes and life styles of the ""contract killers"" of the era. It was fun to watch and full of action for it's time, not full of the gore of todays action movies where blood and guts are more important than the story."
5,4 reasons...,"4 reasons to watch this movie:1- If you are the one who can easily get bored when predict the end of a movie from the beginning. Get ""The mechanic""2- If you are a Charles Bronson fan. Get ""The mechanic""3- If you love to say ""woow"" when watching a movie. Get ""The mechanic""4- If you love to discover that not-known movies can be better than award winners. Get ""The mechanic"""
2,had promise but goes pfffttt.,"Well, I just saw what everyone was saying should win the Oscar for best picture. I thought it was going that way for the first twenty minutes or so of the film. It sure did keep me wondering and riveted. However, like a lot of movies tackling complex themes and ideas, it had to resort to a trainwreck of an ending...Suddenly, from suspense to psychological, it takes a turn for the philosophical. It's not as bad as Vanilla Sky, but you get the feeling they're in the same new genre--the I-Can-Do-Anything-With-This-Movie-And-Come-Out-Original genre. I had more questions than answers after the movie ended which that explanation just didn't solve. Too bad, I really wanted to like it...go watch Insomnia for real psychological suspense and thrills--no, not the remake from Memento's director, Christopher Nolan, but the original by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. (Now, let's see short term memory deal with that name.)"
1,Movie showing backwards,"I didn't like this movie. I lost interest about halfway thru because it was showing each ""chapters"" backwards, starting at the end and finish at the beginning, but I finished it though. No suspense this way because the movie will reveal the answer at the beginning. Good thing I rent it for $1.00."
4,Great idea,"I just saw this movie and I have not had a chance to think about it very much yet, but the idea that everything is in the perception is always an intriguing one. First, running the story backwards is inticing--a brilliant way to isolate pure perception from interpretation. Anything that shows how the passage of time affects our memory and opinions is a winner. What was disappointing was that superimposed over this simple and gigantic concept, was a lot of silliness about murder and personal deception. The twisting of memory and the concept of time was deception enough. Overdone. Maybe shooting for both depth and marketability is not such a great formula. Notice I still gave it four stars--greatness underlies this plot-encumbered story."
5,Forward and Back,"The film, as you know by now, tells the story of the protagonist by presenting his events backwards in time. Simultaneously, the film tells a forward moving parallel story of a similarly affected person. The hero of the piece is a puppet without his awareness and you wish that he never knows the extent of his manipulation by the good folk that populate his world. Never ever boring and occasionally gripping, this movie is a movie lover's movie. It is an essential to any discriminating viewer's personal catalog. Group viewing is best for the conversation that the movie compels."
3,Memento,Memento [Blu-ray]I purcahsed this dvd for my son-in-law for a Christmas gift. He loved it. It was delivered in a timely manner.
3,strange movie but a great view,it was strange going backwards all the time in this movie but it was a greay viewing and Pearce did an excellent job at telling his characters problems. not for everyones taste
1,Did I miss Something?,"I just finished watching this movie and I'm trying to figure out what the other reviewers saw that I missed! It was a waste of money as far as I'm concerned! The movie is totaly backwards, just when I was hoping I would get what was really going on , the credit's started rolling. I sat in my seat thinking, ok now what was that all about, now I know,a real waste of time and money. Maybe the movie was to deep for me?If you want to see this movie, rent it, don't buy it like I did and wish you had your money back!"
1,IT is bad.,"THis is not about originality. It's about bad taste. Another bad movie featuring Guy Pearce, after the atrocious RAVENOUS. Simply dislike it."
2,Ludicrous ...,"The premise is simply not believable. The idea that tattoos and notes on Polaroid pictures could be an adequate information storage and retrieval mechanism for carrying out even the simplest of daily tasks is hardly worth dispelling, but after noting 10 or 20 instances in the first hour of the movie in which the protagonist generated ""new"" memory I stopped watching. Running the plot backward in time adds eccentricity and confusion, but little else to the movie."
2,Disappointing,"Interesting concept - I liked the way they backpedaled through the story. All in all, though, it left me cold, confused, and unfulfilled."
3,Memento Review,"This was a pretty good movie, the acting was good but the plot was alittle confusing, it jumped around alot and was alittle drawn out."
2,pretentious dreck,"I watched this movie based on recommendations, and i hated it. It was supposed to be about someone who cannot make new memories, but nothing in the film really seemed to be about that. it was more just a repetitive series of flashbacks, each of which disclosed another bit of a dumb story. don't bother"
2,Wow,"Everyones Been Giving This movie all this praise that it sets a groundbreaking level for movies now. The truth is that the director made this movie solely for the fact to say ""Im smarter than all of you, so im going to make a movie that none of you can understand so ill look like the genius""And Another Thing, the reason this movie won so many awards makes sense because if you think about it, the average movie critic sees over 1000 movies each year. He sees a lot of action, comedy, thrillers, and romantic movies. But the movie critic can eventually get tired of the same old thing, so movie critics are always looking for that 1 different movie each year to give the award toThis movie was terrible dont go see it"
4,Not a movie you'll forget,"Saw this DVD recently - a few friends of mine had hated it, but the reviews here on Amazon encouraged me to give it a try, and i must say i'm not disappointed.This is not a movie to be watched if you want an escape, laughs or tender moments. However, if you'd like to see a movie that demands your full attention to work out what might be going on, then this is a good choice.I found the idea of coping with a condition where one has no short-term memory quite intriguing. I felt that Guy Pierce did a really good job of playing a complex role, and Carrie Ann Moss & Joe Pantiliano were pretty good too.Christopher Nolan does a great job of intelligently directing what must have been quite a challeging movie to make. The editing, central to this movie, was quite smartly done.I don't mind watching this movie once more, perhaps even backwards !!That having been said, this is the kind of movie that you'd either like to watch again & again, or else regret having seen even once."
2,"a clever concept, but ultimately disappointing","The screenwriter came up with a clever idea, but couldn't figure out what to do with it. The movie raises questions and builds tension and then ends suddenly without resolving them. The ending was a huge letdown. Lots of writers can dream up challenging puzzles; only the really good ones know how to resolve them."
1,AWFUL,"The film attempts to make you feel as confused as the lead character. But misses the mark terribly. The backwards progression of the film becomes EXTREMELY ANNOYING and frankly, this film is totally predictable. One of the worst films I have ever seen."
1,Pimento,"This movie is typical of modern ""cinema"": it is sordid and vulgar and filled with morally vile people. This is the disedification that passes for art nowadays."
5,"Great, deep, film","I'm surprised by some of the negative comments from other reviewers about this movie being nothing more than a cute idea. Quite the contrary, I think this movie is one of the most unnerving and fascinating ones I've ever seen (which is saying a lot, as I like challenging movies).The movie does take some effort to follow, but it's definitely well worth the investment. There are many twists and turns along the way, including a few that I'm sure no one will see coming, coupled with some outstanding performances."
4,You Definitely Won't Forget This.,"Memento is a film that is undeniably original. The fun of the movie is plugging the pieces together and arranging the plat in your head so it adds up. It is mind-bending and thought-provoking and will keep you asking questions until the shocking final reveal. It is a movie that will require multiple viewings and each time you watch you will still enjoy it.The special features on this strange edition are not as enticing as the appear. The idea is genius but the menus are not as difficult as you might think. It definitely adds a whole new level with features like Chronological Viewing and the inclusion of the original story. If you need a new idea, a movie that can change your perception of the industry, this is the film for you. There is nothing else like this out there and I doubt anything will ever dare try and copy."
4,nuF eivom,"I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing, irritating, bothersome, etc. I don't get it. It's easy, just click on ""Work"" and it goes, there are other things you can do leading to other screens and more, which I think makes it a far more interesting ""play me screen"" than the standard stuff. The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's ""The Information"" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the ""backward-drawkcab"" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end. More of a psychological movie with a little action now and then. It's not exactly breaking new ground, so I give it four out of five stars. But it is, as my title indicates, a Fun movie."
5,Have I told you about my condition?,"See, I can't form new memories. We've probably already had this conversation before. I seem to recall seeing this movie, but memories are unreliable. Memory can change the shape of a room; it can change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted. They're just an interpretation, they're not a record, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts. The fact is, this movie works on many levels. The writing is tack sharp. The acting is superb. It's a classic noir thriller and a variation on the con-game genre of film. But it's also a metaphysical examination of the nature of memory. And I can't remember to forget it.Now, where was I?"
4,Never Gets Old,"I give it only four stars because even after watching it three times I'm still fuzy about how to connect the dots. It's nearly impossible to understand the first time you watch it, and you must pay very close attention and piece together scenes to understand it by the time the credits roll. This is also a good thing, though, because you can watch the movie several times without it ever getting old."
1,Great film but avoid this edition at all costs...,"...unless you're into being tortured. I won't be redundant as other's have stated how utterly ridiculous the menu system is and the battery of test you're forced to take to see the features you paid for. this edition is for the pretentious, ""hip"" psuedo-intellectual. Don't get me wrong, I love the film itself but this edition is just terrible. I have never reviewed anything here but I felt so strongly about this edition that I had to join the others in warning you in advance."
5,Novel and interesting,"The format of the movie is very intriguing, the plot plays backwards, and you don't find the motivation for any of the characters' actions until after each scene plays out.This is one of those movies that leave you questioning what really happened; in fact, even more so, because the main character himself has to question what really happened since he can't remember!"
4,Clever Concept Loses Steam Towards the End,"MEMENTO's use of a reverse narrative structure to tell a murder mystery is very clever. As time goes on, the novelty of it all starts to wear at bit thin. However, don't let that discourage you from seeing this film. The performances are generally good and the piece is often quite engaging."
3,Interesting movie,"This movie was interesting. It had a very clever plot. However, at times I found it annoying because of the repetition. I was tempted at one point to fast forward to the end to find out what happened. If you're an impatient movie goer, then this movie is not for you."
1,"Thanks robe4, for the spoilers...","This movie wasn't very good, and not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Read the above guy's review and you wan't have to waste your money on this pseudo-intellectual pig. If you want something to wrap your mind around, get Waking Life by Richard Linklater."
1,Ground Hog Day Revisited,"I watched it this weekend and it was slow. I finished it because I don't like to see half a movie. But really, it was like watching Ground Hog Day without the Humor."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Okay, maybe not THE worst, but certainly one of the worst movies ever. Overhyped by pseudo-intelligensia who think the schizophrenic style amounts to ""art."""
3,Not Boring Just Extremely Exaggerated...,"There was nothing boring about this film. I heard this film's indisputable. Yet again, I was left disappointed because it failed to thrill me. No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up. I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does. By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost. Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it ""exciting"" and ""re-watchable"". I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around. Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by. However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.Am I over critical? Maybe. I just choose to be so with Memento. I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself. There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie. Atleast not mine."
3,A bit over-rated,"I guess you'll read the other reviews so I'm just going to say that the whole ""no new memories"" aspect and the ""story told backwards"" thing just wears thin after awhile. The plot twists at the end, which is really the beginning, don't live up to the hype. This movie certainly made ""no new memories"" for me.Why don't you try ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""The Manchurian Candidate"" instead?"
5,Best movie I've seen in a while,"Why hollywood spends 100 million dollars making [junky] movies is beyond me when all they need are more scripts as well written as this one.I watched it twice over the this past weekend for the first and second times. WOW, what a movie. You feel like your a detective putting pieces of a puzzle together backwards. I really enjoyed this movie greatly."
5,Really capturing...,"Ok, a friend of mine comes to me and lends me a copy of Memento saying that this is a movie you are going to love. 5 months later doing nothing at home I see the movie. Well..WOW! I mean it's not the best movie ever, but from the openings to the final credits I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. It really kept me think what was going to happen next. Relly enjoyable movie. I agree...a few mistakes, but very tolerable, and well it's just a picture so enjoy it. Highly recommended."
2,OK.......put it this way,I really hated the movie......so i can't judge it since its all about the taste...but then again come on what happend to the dvd options??? really poor features but the movie was bad anyways ...so u would not really expect cool features
2,The Emperor is Naked,"Friends recommended this movie to me. Smart friends. Memento is a classic who-done-it murder mystery (...) We are deliberately fed conflicting misinformation at the end of the film (or should I say the beginning?). It is as if the director (...) structured the plot-line in reverse chronological order, with the hope that his audience would be sufficiently confused that they would either assume there had been logical explanations for everything or, better yet, they would had invent their own explanations. My friends have come up with differing explanations (...), however these explanations are not necessarily grounded in the ""facts"" presented in the film. (...)The real kicker is that many people are watching the movie over and over, hoping to figure it out. Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man will sooner figure out ""Who's on first."" And that's because Memento, like Abbott and Costello's famous routine, is not a riddle - it merely thinks that it is."
5,such a cool movie and Guy Pearce is the coolest,This movie you have to watch more than once so it is a good ideato buy it. The whole story starts at the end and the story unfolds backwards. I know it sounds confusing but believe meyou will want to watch it over and over. You will see a sceneout of nowhere and then the next thing you know the next scenceexplains how the previous scene got to that point. It is such an original movie--a new classic thriller. The cast is greatand this movie rocks.
5,"Mind Numbing, Great entertainment!!","Memento (Blu-Ray)Memento's been out for a while, but for newcomers and especially on blu-ray it warrants itself the purchase. The storytelling is being presented to us in Reverse-Chronological order, the way it spills its plot and the story's characters scene by scene is an achievement in movie making which is an amazing thrill to enjoy watching this film! MUST BUY!!"
2,"Okay, I get it. The idea is you're real smart, right?","At the end of this movie, you're supposed to go ""Wow! That's brilliant!"" Instead, I was quite glad that it was over. It starts off with an interesting enough premise, but quickly gets way too wrapped up in its own clever structure and plot twists, and ends up degenerating into an experiemntal wank. I like smart movies, but this one just tries way too hard. I emerged from it feeling like I had just been forced into a duel with the director, with him trying to outsmart me every step back of the way when all I was looking for was a couple hours' entertainment. In the end, he succeeds in showing how clever he is, but does so at the expense of a good movie."
3,Complex revenge thriller,"A man suffering from a mental disorder (short-term memory loss), which means that he cannot recall events that would only transpire moments before, is entangled in trying to take revenge on the man that murdered his wife. The film is stylish and intelligent, smartly and ingeniously directed, and exploring a number of profound issues such as memory, identity and learning techniques, though it's overburdened by its elaborate and complex plot, which demands total concentration on the part of the viewer, or else the thread is lost. For buffs of ""art"" cinema, but definitely not for those who want some fast-paced, ""no-brainer"" entertainment."
2,Too Darn Depressing for Me,"The acting was too well done. All three leading ladies range from somewhat disatisfied to suicidally depressed and they were convincing. But here's the thing. Watching and listening to people who are depressed is DEPRESSING. And watching this movie was depressing. I watched for about an hour thinking it might pick up, that perhaps a real ray of sunshine would appear. But... I'm giving up. I will not put myself through watching the rest of it.Having gone and read other reviews now, even some by people who liked the film, I don't think I missing anything. Whew.... I need to go watch Miracle or Rudy or Remember the Titans, SOMETHING inspirational to shake off this one."
2,"GREAT ACTING AND SET UP, BUT STILL MISSING SOMETHING","I can understand why this movie got the ""Oscar"" for best performing actress, simply because the acting of the three leading ladies are outstanding!, I understand the plot but I still believe this movie was missing something, a high point, something, it just somehow gets kind of lost in monotony. Nicole Kidman is unrecognizable, her make up is great, Julianne Moore has been denied by the award comitee for years, she's a great actress she deserves one already, and Meryl Streep as always saving a play that lack of a true stunning ending, I just lost this movie at the end..."
3,Depressing.,"Yes, the tone of this movie is depressing, but so is the melodrama. The acting is not as top-notch as one would expect from such a magnificent cast. Meryl Streep, completely robbed of the Oscar for ""One True Thing,"" goes for the throat again but sadly misses the mark. Ed Harris and Jeff Daniels are the only actors here maintaining their equillibrium, and both use subtlety instead of ""the big crying scene"" to get their honest performances across. Julianne Moore is above average here, as well, but check out her amazing performance in ""Far From Heaven"" if you would like to see what she's really capable of. Initially, I was ready to slash this movie to bits, but I have calmed down enough after being thorougly depressed to note the qualities in this over-lauded film."
1,Definitively Awful,"This Film is one of those that only the Critics would love.Believe it or not, on my First view of HOURS, I did not know that Virginia Woolf was played by Kidman. I just knew that who-ever it was had been truly Dreadful.As good as the Artistic production is on this Work, Kidman is just Plain Awful.And Just as I Loved The Start of SCREAM because Drew was Done away with, it was brilliant that Kidman's Character was appropriately Dispatched.Such a waste of Space for these Hours."
2,An upsetting and demented movie!,"I don't really know what the magnificent reviews are all about. I guess when you have actors like Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman the critics tend to get overexcited. I was very upset by this movie. It theme was morbid and the music even more depressing. I guess in times like these it is the ""IN"" thing to constantly harp on themes like homosexuality and lesbianism, but this is not an uplifting movie. When I go to see a film it is to be entertained and come out with a good feeling. This film certainly failed on that count. I don't want to see women kissing women, AIDS victims throwing themselves out of the window and women drowning themselves in a lake. This story is about misfits who cannot accept life. Aside from the acting, which was great, I hated the film. I'm sorry I bought it and will soon dump it. Hollywood is becoming obsessed with the gay issues."
1,Terrible,"What a boring and dark film!! We watched it because of all the hype about this movie from media. What a waste of talent and film!! What tries to be a moving story turns out to be a disappointment. Actually, it wasn't all that disappointed as we were not anticipating anything out of the film to begin with. What we did learn was that there was a lot of homosexual overtones to each of the characters. I didn't have a problem with how the movie cut back and forth to each of the 3 characters, however, the stories were very unattractive. It made you want to slap each of them and say ""Snap out of it!! Grow up and be glad you are alive!"" Seriously, each of these characters brooded over everything. Kidman's character was the worst. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this terrible movie. This movie and ""American Beauty"" are in the same boat. Let's hope it sinks and goes straight to the bottom!!"
1,Disappointed viewer,"This moving is awful: boring, depressing and pointless! I'm sorry I wasted my time watching it. :("
1,Terrible,This movie was disturbing. It makes me mad and sad when parents do inappropriate things with their children around!! Although they really shouldn't be doing it at all... I couldn't even finish watching the last half hour or so. No wonder they were troubled... They need JESUS.
1,The Big Ugly Nose That Changes Colors in the Light,"As much as I have appreciate prior works of each of these actors, I had no sympathy for any of them. I found them selfish, depressing, neurotic and I did not care if they lived or died except the little boy who ended up jumping out of the window. I could identify. Someone needed to put all of them out of their misery. When Meryl Streep started making out with her roommate, I was about to jump out the window and decided instead to turn it off and return it to the nearest video store ASAP."
1,Hours and hours of dreary drudgery,"Please understand that I knew going in that this was a highly rated film that has a large adoring audience. But I will always give an honest assessment of how I react to a film. Maybe my expectations were too high. No, that's not it, at all. I really didn't know what to expect.This is three stories spun loosely into one. Set decades apart, in the 1920's, 1950's and 1990's, three women lead very comfortable but miserably unfulfilling lives. They mope about, drowning in self-pity, wishing they were happy, but doing nothing to achieve that goal. They seem to luxuriate in their own angst. Oh, sweet sorrow...Bah! These women are largely unsympathic characters with no discernable qualities other than their deep dissatisfaction with their upper-middle class existence. I'm just glad that I rented this rather than seeing it in a theater, where I'd have paid so much more for two hours of sheer boredom."
3,Ford saves it,"Frantic isn't the smartest film ever made. In fact, hadn't it had Ford it would be a complete waste. Polanski relates this in no way to his other classics, especially Chinatown, which it has a lot in common with (well, sort of). Anyway, it's worth a watch, but unless you are crazy for Ford, keep the dough in your pocket."
2,Mildly entertaining,"Unfortunately, like most movies of this type, the plot simply isn't credible. Might as well watch batman or some such."
3,"Good film, Bad DVD, shame on Warner","This review is more about the DVD transfer than the movie. Some friends brought this DVD to our house and we all watched it. I liked the movie, and because I liked it, (4 stars) I am disappointed that the transfer to DVD (2 stars) is so grainy, and that it is only in Pan and Scan, not widescreen. I have many VHS tapes which are sharper looking and sound better (I have Dolby Surround). I have many DVD's that offer both aspect ratios. If only one aspect is offered on DVD, it should be the widescreen theatrical version, IMHO, not Pan and Scan. I have learned that there is a great deal of variation in the quality of DVDs that are available, and this DVD proves that recent vintage films don't guarantee a good transfer. In my opinion this type of budget purchase can only be enjoyed on a small screen tv, so I will not buy until this film is properly re-mastered and offered on DVD in widescreen. Warner should do better! The film deserves it."
1,Very poor piece of work,I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms. You can hardly hear the rain and thunderstorms for the much louder and very poor overlay of very poor music.
4,The Rainbow and the Rose; Revisited,"I read The Rainbow and The Rose , along with most of Nevil Shute's novels, many years ago. Interestingly, I've never read On The Beach. I have, however, recently begun buying copies of Shute's novels for rereading. I wish to see if my sixty year old personna interprets them differently than I did as an eighteen year old.At the time I first read The Rainbow and The Rose, I thought it as good as A Town Like Alice. I could not wait for Ron Clarke to become airborne once again, as he made his way across Australia, so that he would continue to experience the visions that were some sort of gift to help him sort out his feelings toward the woman he once loved and the man who'd won her heart so many years ago.I thought back then, and I think today that the book would make a wonderful movie, if done correctly and with the right people.I urge anyone with even a passing interest in Shute's work to read The Rainbow and The Rose."
1,Grandmother,"Not a good movie for young children, very sassy, bullies and bad language for young children. You wonder where they get some of the things they say these days....well examples like this movie."
2,Bad record even for Dylan fans,"I wouldnt recommend this one even to Dylan Fans. The sound is terrible, and Dylan voice is at his most nasal. Mick Taylor sounds good, Santana plays in the last song, but basically there are many other live albums better than this one. The acoustic set is maybe the best from the set. But then again, the sound spoils the listening experience. I spent the first 3 songs trying to adjust my stereo trying to get the best sound and by the fourth I just gave up. Its a 3 star record but Ill give it a 2 just for that."
4,An unpleasant family...and an amazing last page...,"A good Miss Marple mystery. Though Miss Marple is not mentioned in it as often as I'd expect. At the center of a mystery is a very unpleasant family. They are not likeable characters. The plot twists got me again, and the murderer turned out to be someone I did not want it to be! The very last page is priceless. Reading the last page made the whole book worthwhile. Don't know how Christie does that..."
2,Texas Burning,"So many reviews already. Let's keep this short. Has anyone mentioned the absurdity of making a !Texas! !Death! !Penalty! !Movie! AND COMPLETELY LEAVE OUT RACE?!? Yikes. Yes, the red herrings are annoying, but this is even worse for being Mississippi Burning all over again.Why do writers and directors think that they can preach the hard-line about a serious topic....while making a 2nd rate thriller of the month? For that matter, why do otherwise smart actors think that they can act there way out of a hot-house mess of a script? Spacey, Winslet and Linney are always fun to watch, but what a waste of talent."
4,Life and death,"It's interesting to read the reviews of this movie. The right-wing, death penalty advocates generally hated it, those who favor abolition thought it was great. What I'd say, just considering it as a movie, is that it was well-acted, moved along quickly and contained enough misdirection to make it enjoyable to speculate on what was finally going to happen. In fact, the point of the final twist seems to have been missed by many of the reviewers.Of course, a movie is going to change no-one's mind about the death penalty. Just put your prejudices aside and enjoy it for what it is."
4,Underrated,"Those concerned that this is propaganda for the anti-death penalty cause are missing the point. The politics of this movie aren't very important. It's really just a thriller, a decent one. The ending isn't that much of a surprise, but guessing the ending is half the fun of seeing something like this. Some complain about the acting and writing. It may not be the best work of anyone involved; but I was able to enjoy it and even believe that people might be willing literally to sacrifice themselves for something they believe in strongly. The implausibility of it all didn't bother me. In short, this is an underrated film that's worth seeing if you're not in a nitpicky mood."
4,Fabulous...intellectually stimulating,Must see...don't watch trailers - its much better if you figure it out on your own. It is not a movie I would watch over and over yet the first time was great.
1,Nonsense,"I have never seen such a waste of talent before in a film before. We see Kevin Spacey playing the same role he's played a million times, then we have sell out Kate Winslet with a bad American accent and the same facial expression throughout the entire film. The only good thing about this movie is Laura Linney's performance. Avoid this Hollywood tripe at all costs!"
5,achingly beautiful and fragile sonic rage,"Soundscapes so devastating they may leave you writhing on the floor. If it doesn't take your breath away, you were never alive to begin with."
4,Love at first listening,"I bought this album because a store clerk recommended it to me. I was looking for something by Nitzer Ebb and began to talk about music with this guy, and he went to one of the shelves and asked me to give Chrome a try. Boy, I am grateful. This CD is beautiful. I remember the first time I heard it I thought this was something out of the dark part of the 80s, but it's out of the 90s. I couldn't believe that.Anyway, I can't stop listening to The Nude, it evokes a lot of mixed feelings. I think (for me) it's about a girl I can't have not because she hates me or something, but because we're in a position where I can't have something with her right now, so I hold her as something like a beautiful paint, that I can only look upon but not touch... ""You're making me doubt myself""."
4,encouraging poster for REAL women,"this poster with marilyn monroe on a bench press is quite sweet, everyone at our gym soo loves it that i bought it as a gift for a friend who got a new house. should make a nice addition to his gym. i here tell she was a size 14 or 12 ... not a 2;)"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed because I was expecting to see how to UPDATE the interior of an older boat. While the content is fine to show what can be done and ideas on how to achieve it, the pictures and projects looked like they were from the 80's. Our boat is from 1984 and we were looking to update it to 2011-2012 period, not 1985. If you looking for interior design inspiration, look elsewhere. If you want to repair your 1980's boat to it's original period styling, this is a good resource."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I was quite disappointed by the book - rather shallow rendering of facts, practically no analysis, theoritising without any practical conclusions. Simple internet search provides more useful information..."
5,Truly Spiritual,"Jarrett, Peacock & DeJohnette are truly spiritual. The exchange between players is refreshing, inventive and cutting edge. A sound that's truly their own. Many times recording are just acontrived mimic of other players of the past. It's a nice change to see a trio, that understands history references it in their playing but have evolved to the next step. Their use of rhythms, voicings and original arrangements are breath-taking."
3,he just can't help himself,"My take on this CD is the same as that of several reviewers here on amazon: some striking music, almost fatally marred by Jarrett's bizarre noise-making. Jarrett has to be the most self-destructive figure in the jazz world. He behaves and frequently talks like such a complete @#$%* that he seems to be out to sabotage his career. I'm weary of trying to figure the guy out. My advice: listen to Marc Copland instead, a cruelly underrated pianist and a thoroughly decent person."
4,Jarrett - Standards Vol 1 Review,"When this recording was first issued one could not have known that it would establish the framework for much of Jarrett's jazz-based recordings for the next 2 decades. This release was recorded at the same sessions that also produced Standards Vol 2 and Changes. Given all the Standards works available, you'll do better to start elsewhere. Standwards Volume 2 is close to perfection, and has the leg up on this recording. It is hard to say exactly why, but this seems a tentative first step at times, whereas Volume 2 seems flawless and beautiful. And of course the standards recordings kept coming and coming, with a lot of great ones ahead. So pick this one up if you want to see where it all began, but pick Standards Vol 2 if you want to hear the best studio recording by this trio (Note: Gary Peacocks Tales Of Another features the same trio with a different agenda, recorded years earlier, and is also a great one)"
1,"Can somebody just, please, muzzle the piano player?","I have about 8 Keith Jarrett cds, so let's get that established right away. He is a genius, no question---probably one of the best piano players to have ever drawn breath or touched key. I can deal with his peculiar version of Tourette's syndrome( my half tongue-in-cheek diagnosis) on most albums ('scat singing' someone called it? uh-----yeah)---but not on this one. I just tried again and kept skipping to the next track until there were no more next tracks. The music can't compete with that idiotic noise. I'm tossing this cd."

2,The problem is revealed by the title...,"... and a good ending cannot overcome it.There is no supernatural foe to drag us through the tepid parts, and a somewhat interesting yet slow mystery is not enough to make us sit without fidgeting. Especially not when the quality of the print is poor.The Human Monster is smarter than most of this type of fare, as it is based on an Edgar Wallace novel. But like most of this type of fare, nothing of any real note happens until the last fifteen minutes. Then it gets quite good, with chases and plot twists and the expected, if satisfying, retribution. Yet by that point the damage is done.As a movie, the Human Monster makes a very good poster.See also: ""The Monogram Nine,"" as they are known to Lugosi's most ardent."
2,A low-budget mystery that only has Bela Lugosi to recommend,"This is an example of Bela Lugosi's lesser film work. It's a creaky, ""cheapy-creepy"" featuring Lugosi in a dual role. A killer stalks London, and Bela's slum-area workhouse is connected. There is also a blind ""ape-man"" sort of killer creeping around the slums, leaving a trail of victims. The film is obviously dated and produced on a low budget. Determined Bela Lugosi fans should be pleased, but others should beware!"
5,A powerful and moving memoir,"The author mesmerizes you with the simplicity and eloquence of her writing. She moves you with her childhood, her courage in the camps and the power of her spirit in returning to choose life again."
3,Hammer Pants?,"got these 100% silk pajamas for christmas and the fabric is wonderful wash after wash, but the crotch is so long on the pants...my husband calls them MC hammer pants. This is fine because I wear them while I travel for work without him. They are good, but would prefer a better fit."
3,Very good for the price,"I bought them for less than $20.00 which was a good price for the pjs. quality is reasonable but I have found other sleepwear on Amazon that is expensive yet well worth it and I am putting in the link for reference.Women's Pajamas in Silk, TexereSilk Pajamas with Exquisite Hand Painted Art, The Butterfly Garden"
2,rl222,"The dvd was in fine shape and fit the definition of ""like new."" However, the case that the disk came in was cracked and torn in two places and would be categorized as acceptable by anyone's definition. Please adhere to the written standards of ""like new"" for future products!"
3,Blu-ray quality suffers...,First thing - love the movie. Already have the DVD so was thrilled to see the blu-ray finally come out. Overall the transfer to blu-ray is average. Some of the scenes look great and others have a grainy texture. Poor quality control. For $7 I won't complain but am disappointed. Check out the extras including deleted scenes and 'Making Harry met Sally.' Tricky to find the main menu. Hope they release the 'Sleepless in Seattle' blu-ray soon and do a better job!!!
5,"Excellent,Funny,Zanny,Entertaining",One of the most Original Romantic Comedies. Makes you Laugh and forget your problems for a couple of hours. This is a must see!!!!
4,When Harry Met Sally,"It's a classic romance, full of ups & downs, discovering your soulmate is the best friend sitting right next to you. Full of memorable scenes and destined to be one of those movies you'll want to watch over and over again."
4,My Favorite Movie!,"I've seen this movie a dozen times and love it everytime. It's a perfect romantic movie. I also love ""You've Got Mail"" . Both have great endings!"
1,When i met the gun!,"this is one of millions of bad movies you shouldn't watch. it's really a bad romantic monologue and the charcters were mistaken. don't ever watch billy crystal movies because you'll just want your money back, if you think he's funny, then comedy is dead."
1,Soylent Dick Says: Utter Trash,How to woo a lady - be an oaf and spit grape seeds out of the window - what a wonderful example of how to impress females! Amercian trash with no story.
5,Best New Year's Eve movie ever!,"Best romantic comedy ever made. Even if you're not into romantic comedies, this is a must see. Overflowing with wit and humor. Billy Crystal is hilarious and Meg Ryan can take the comedic punches and punch back. The story flows well from scene to scene and keeps you interested in the characters."
5,My all time favorite movie!,"This movie never fails to entertain me, no matter how many times I see it...and I've seen it many times! The music is wonderful, and Billy Crystal is at his best. And I LOVE the little vignettes of the old married couples that are woven into the movie...PRICELESS!!!"
3,"Widescreen? Yeah, right !","Okay. I'm gettin' real peeved. Yet another MGM release under false pretenses. First of all, let me say that this is a very good movie...that's why I bought the DVD. But then, as I have before with many other MGM DVDs, I was greatly disappointed. This is another full-screen version with the black bars added to give the illusion of widescreen...Why does the studio continue to do this? My thinking is that it's a whole lot cheaper to digitally impose black bars on the screen rather than dig up the original widescreen transfer. Just take the more common full-screen edition, add black bars, and sell it to the public as widescreen...[they] won't know the difference.They're ripping you off, people."
4,"If You Have to Watch a Romantic Comedy, Watch This One","""When Harry Met Sally."" What can you say? It's the quintessential romantic comedy. Compared to most of the crap that gets put out these days, however, I really enjoy this film. Billy Crystal's charm and comedy manage to keep the movie light on its feet and prevent it from sinking into the sappy, melodrama that so many of these films fall right into. Meg Ryan, an actress I have come to despise as a no-talent hack that only knows how to play the hard-to-get snob, is young in this film and brighter than most of her roles. And check out the very uncharacteristic, and very famous, restaurant orgasm scene. It's classic.The film, in a similar manner to ""High Fidelity,"" explores relationships, in part, from the male perspective-an interesting viewpoint that often gets lost in modern day romantic comedies. You have to see this film-if only to save yourself from the disasters of another ""Kate and Leopold."""
5,I'M HOOKED ON BEEGIE!,"By now, I may own nearly all her recordings even though each time I purchase one from Amazon, I think it'll be the last.If you like the serenity the ""oldies"" bring, then you'll love the sound you'll hear, whether you're sitting at the computer or as background to a dinner party. Beegie Adair always delivers a distinctive, recognizable style, one I would describe as getting to the heart, the emotion, of the original composer(s). I'm always amazed at how she phrases a song like ""Moon River"" or ""Old Cape Cod"" so that it always sounds fresh.By the way, until nine months ago, I confess I never heard the name ""Beegie Adair."" Then, a TV commercial promoted a CD, and I was hooked! You probably will be, too."
4,Toys are Anew with Knights of Old,"With Stikfas there are two great things. Possibility and pose ""ability"".With this knight you have the Possibility of customizing your figure and horse into anything your heart desires with a little bit of paint or none at all becuase it comes with a sheet of decals/ stickers. There is even a trick to making a centuar when you combine the knight and horse for all your mythology buffs.Stikfas also have great Pose ""ability"" too. Whether it charging another knight for a joust or simply placed keeping watch over desktop kingdom, these guys are very articulated.I agree these are not for young children due to small parts and a parent will need to help put the knight and horse together. and if ther are any sharpe edges they are easily filed down with a emery board or light sandpaper.Another trick is if the joints seem too loose for your liking you can dab a little clear nailpolish on the joint and it tights up.Lots of fun."
1,The three things your child may learn from this video...,"1)to behave just like Cera (or in other words--like a brat) 2)to head-butt (think: younger sibling) and, 3)to used improper English (""me want...""). I had to pull the plug on this movie after I figured out where my 3 year old was picking up these annoying, new habits. She, and I'm sure others, thought the dinosaurs were cute--I beg to differ. Cera is quite negative and bratty and also happens to be the only girl dinosaur in the movie--hmmm. Probably a so-so movie for kids that aren't affected too much by what they watch but I would think twice before purchasing it for an impressionable child."
4,good movie,"i enjoyed watching this movie with my grandson, but it is not up to the same standards as vol 1 and 10 in the set."
3,The English Issues.,"Personally, I would love it if the characters spoke in a correct grammatical manner, but in real life there are many adults who cannot do that, so it would be unreasonable to expect child characters to do so. ( Besides, children watching the film probably would not notice, or be bothered if they did .)Also, correct me if I am wrong, but I always thought that Ducky was female, so Cera is not the only girl in the group.I enjoyed the film, but I think my favorite so far is "" The Big Freeze "" : I have a soft spot for Spike.I am looking forward to number ten "" The Great Migration "" coming out in this country, though I do not know when that will be."
3,"Good, in one way better than WWD","If you know allot about dinosaurs (like me!), go get Walking w/ Dinosaurs (WWD). If you are a little kid looking for some nice cute dinos, go for this. I especially like Spike and Mo. I always notice that Cera has a bit of a bad attitude which may teach you to behave like her - oh no. Ducky is quite a darling, I think. Why I like Land Before Time: Journey to Big Water over all the other ones is because of that Mo. He's just so cute! Like his way of talking and the cuteness (or however you spell it!) of his face. I don't own the original, only Mysterias Island and Big Freeze, of course along with this one. Get this now, but only if you are young (maybe under 7 I would say)."
2,King Horror,"A vampire preys on a young woman. A virgin falls for a boy in school only to learn he is a vampire. Set in Bodega Bay, California. Don't fall for King's gimmick- he's mediocre. It plays more like a drama than a horror film. But there is a monster sequence at the end."
3,"For Madchen Amick fans, otherwise...","This isn't as horrible as some would have you believe, but it's not much of a horror film either. I like it as an easy way to kill 90 minutes every few years. The story is a tad weak, much like the effects. Personally I keep this around as I'm a huge Madchen Amick fan, and this is one of her films with the most screen time. She looks amazing of course, extra-virginal for this movie. Though she has worked often through the years, she is sadly still remembered mostly for Twin Peaks (Shelly), some twenty years ago.If you're a fellow fan of hers, or Stephen King, or B-grade horrors you should enjoy Sleepwalkers."
2,You'll need a shower after this one...,"If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car?? Anyway, just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy getting stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial ""wazoo"". Just don't see it. Wait, I take that back! See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. He's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, other than that...wow...BAD."
2,Death by Corn,This gets 2 stars solely for the scene where the police officer is fatally stabbed with an ear of corn.
4,fun,"First mick garris king collaboration.Dont expect something too deep, save that for the later Garris films. This one is superficial fun. Gory, nicley paced- some truly wonderful camera movements(absolute favourite- when Charles and Tanya roll across the ground and the camera rolls with them; at first its a parody of the romantic cliche, but the camera keeps on moving, and suddenly its dangerous- then the shot ends, and the entire scene is different; really well done).Its directed with flair and energy. Some choice cameos. Dont expect The Shining, the tone is very different. have fun."
1,Ugly doll,This doll looks even uglier than the blonde Anna Coren Doll--or was that a Tonya Coren doll? Blonde dolls are ugly- that's all I can say.
3,"Not the best, not the worst either","In my opinion, this Cloe doll is just 'okay'. There is nothing really great about her, but she isn't awful, either. Her hair is really shinny and natural-looking, and her eyes are a really pretty sky blue color. I also LOVE how her skirt is layered like that, but i don't really like the jean-mini skirt that much. Her shoes are cool though, and i love the designs 'painted; on her. :D"
5,Last will and testament of a great band,"Popular opinion has it that this fourth and final Wonder Stuff record is supbar and easily ranks as the group's worst effort. I've always disagreed with this sentiment - and never moreso than I do now, some seven-plus years after its release. I think the lyrics are among the best that Miles penned while fronting The Wonder Suff, and the music is self-assured and confident. True, it's not as ""fun"" an album as some of their earlier work, but that was never the intent. It serves as the last will and testament of a truly great band. It commands respect and should be listened to with reverence. As Miles writes on ""Sing the Absurd"" - ""I can reflect on the days when respect had nothing to do with behavior, and I can recall a day when we'd all laugh in the face of our failure."" CFTMI is anything but a failure."
3,Unbelievable performance by Johnny Depp!,"I have to tell you that I have never been a Johnny Depp fan but recently have gotten into his movies. What an underrated actor. The movie was so-so but it's worth it just to see the performance that Johnny Depp gives. He acts with his whole being. You can see the humor in his eyes, the way he moves. He is very impressive in this role. As for the movie, good story line but could have been developed better."
3,I loved it but...,"Okay, let's clear this up... From a purely entertainment standpoint, I loved this movie. The only reason I took two stars away from this DVD is the horrific commentary. The director basically tells us what's going to happen in the current scene through out the entire film. Now, while this may be a bonus for someone who may be visually impaired, I found it to be very boring. There were no funny tales of things that happened on this day or that. There was nothing informative such as problems they had to overcome, or camera lenses. I almost fell asleep. I know what you're saying... ""Why didn't you turn it off?"" I kept expecting it to get better. It had to. I was indeed absolutely wrong. Don't waste your time. But definitely watch the film. Oliver Platt is a comic genius, and many don't realize he has a part in this film. :)"
5,"Amagical,moving,moviethatpeopleofallagesshouldsee!","Enter the world of imagination through a guy's point of view, who sees the world in a whole new way. Meet Sam, (Jonny Depp). Been & Joon's new ""cousin,"" Joon had got in the game of poker. They meet Sam, only they don't know that he's some what different from all of the rest of them. He's creative, and not afraid of anyone who messes with him. This movie, when I first watched, I thought of how wonderful these actors can play such moving characters. Especially Mary Stuart Masterson, and Johnny Depp. ""Benny & Joon"" is a movie for everyone. If you love Depp's movies, then you gotta see ""Benny & Joon."" Such another outstanding, successful, performance by all the characters in this movie. Wonderful! Wonderul! Wonderful!"
5,Early Johnny Depp,"Although this is one of the early movies when Johnny Depp was just starting out, The acting was as usual fantastic and the movie was great. It was funny but also had an excellent story behind it. I already had the movie on vhs but purchased it on DVD so I could watch it more often. I'm not sorry at all and enjoy watching it each time."
4,If you love Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin style comedy this is a must have,"I LOVE this movie. It is a different type of story for sure, but in a refreshing way. Johnny Depp does a blow-out job of Buster Keaton style comedy in this movie playing Sam, a cousin of a friend who comes to live with Benny and Joon. He is funny, sensitive, serious, and courageous. Mary Stuart Masterson does a fabulous job of playing Joon. Mr. Quinn does a great job of playing the big brother.My son, who is 11, watched this with us and he laughed so hard at Sam's antics that he couldn't catch his breath. He giggled throughout the entire movie. There is a love scene which in my opinion is tastefully done. There is some language and ludicrous gambling.Three thumbs up!"
1,Excursions in Geometry,"This guide is ambiguous and provides very little information about obscure topics such as inversive geometry. The text is difficult to comprehend not because of its vocabulary, but because it tend to veer off course. Although the subject matter is interesting, it is very difficult to expose when confronted to diagrams that are basically not explained. This could not be used as a classroom guide because it tends to confound even gifted math students. An interesting remark was made, which was, ""I think he's going to start talking about his dog right now."" This book would only be reccomended to the top 2% of math students, because it is not accesible to the general public. I should hope that someone who reads this book writes a revision of it."
2,A very depressing soundtrack,"The soundtrack is a waste of money. I have seen the movie twice over Memorial Day weekend and it is very good. The soundtrack is very bad. Wait for the video. It is as if the producer took the darkest music of the movie and recorded it for the cd. There was more uplifting music I heard in the movie which should have been on the soundtrack, but I guess they left it off so that another soundtrack can be release later as with Titanic which was a much better soundtrack. On the same token, the music did not make Pearl Harbor. The story and the characters are what make Pearl Harbor such a great movie. Only buy this if you are a collector of soundtracks. This is one very depressing soundtrack. All of the high melodies from the movie are no where to be found. So sad for such a good movie. Put this cd on the shelf with Saving Private Ryan to collect more dust after a few spins."
3,NEEDS MORE MUSIC,"Very simple: Needs more action music. Instead, we get 3 tracks (2-4) that sounds WAAAAY to similar and a few pieces of suspense that weren't even written by Zimmer!I was horrified to learn that my favorite composer had not composed the music to track 8. Instead, it was one of the Media Ventures ""assistants"", Steve Jablonsky.That makes you wonder: Can these ""assistants"" write music that is better than the Zimmer man himself??..."
3,better than nothing,"Hans Zimmer is a genius. From his work on Drop Zone, Gladiator, The Rock, and Pearl Harbor, his music is by far the best. The only thing missing form the current Pearl Harbor soundtrack is half the music. All that's on this CD are love themes and the Japanese preparing for the attack. The action scene music is mysteriously missing. What's there is gorgeous, but I miss the rest."
3,THe Only Thing Is A&E is Cheap!,The only thing is A&E; is Cheap! Yup Cheap! No Closed Caption are SDH... But the UK one has SDH.. For the Hear Of Hearing... And it is in English...You will need to get a DVD player that can play UK DVDs. But they are al over on the net. So I am going to get the UK DVDs.
3,The question that needs to be asked...,"...is does this release contain season 1 episodes derived from the 2005 high-definition digital restoration? Or is it simply a repackaging of the previous Region 1 releases that claimed to be a remaster put pale in comparison. One way to tell is if Martin Landau's credit shot has him standing against a pristine clean & pure white background. Or does the quality of that shot vary between episodes and is generally soft, yellowish and covered in dirt & grain? If it's the latter the these are old versions.For more information, just type ""space 1999 hd"" into Google."
3,30th Anniversary MegaSet of Space: 1999,"Having the original MegaSet of Space: 1999, I was hoping to have 'extras' on the 30th Anniversary MegaSet DVD's. The DVD containers have been changed and condensed, but otherwise the offerings are the same as the original MegaSet -- the addded 'Bonus Disc' is the same that has been available at all the Space: 1999 Conventions since 2005. The 'Special Features' throughout the MegaSet are the same as on the original MegaSet. It would have been ""special"" if the Anniversary MegaSet had 'bloopers', 'behind the scenes' that weren't on the original MegaSet DVD's, et al. A purchase of this MegaSet is more for nostalgia and to support the continuing life (after cancellation) of Space: 1999."
4,you get it all here but..,This is not the remastered job that network media did in europe. BUt those masters are being used on the blu ray version of this item. This set features alot of dirt and scratches that the other europeon sets don't have. The br is fine too. The shows first season was it's highlight. It's sci fi that interesting but very fantasy orientated actually. The second season is even more fantasy orientated. The first though has some episodes that are solid sci fi and among the best ever put on film. So it is a mix but the whole thing is fun. And ignore ANY IDIOT who talks about special effects. they were fine back then.
5,HUGE fan,"I was almost ready to buy this on VHS! Glad the DVD came out before I put down the $. I haven't looked at the bonus materials yet, but just owning this series in it's entirety is awesome!"
3,Doesn't age well,"I had just finished the UFO tv series and was pleasantly surprised how well that series had aged, so I decide to give Space 1999 a try. I remember loving this series as a child, but unfortunately on a second viewing it does not hold up well. Where to start. The packaging itself is nicely done. The transfer is ok, but looks washed out and grainy at times. The sound mixing is poor - alternating between blasting music and whispering dialog. And most surprising of all, the special effects, both visual and audio, seem worse than those in UFO, a much earlier series. The acting and characters seem flat and one dimensional and the plots just aren't compelling.That all said, if you're a fan of Gerry Anderson's work, then it is worth adding to your collection, otherwise I'd pass."
3,Episodes out of seqence,Re-mastered its not but that not what I have problem with. Started watching episode 2 on the disc and it got me wondering it was too far in the story. So I looked up the episode guide to when the series showed on TV. The episodes on the discs are all out of sequence. I have had to print the episode guide and find out on which disc they are on. I am surprised this has not benn mentioned before.
2,very disappointed,I ordered this set from media blasters through Amazon. The discs work fine are of good quality but the problem was that instead of the sleeve containing disc seven and eight I had a second bonus disc in that slot. I did not realize this until I got that far in viewing the series. Since that was after media blasters 30 day exchange window they would do nothing for me and the people there were rude saying basiclly tough luck buyer beware. The discs I watched were fine but do not ever buy anything from media blasters they are rude and they do not stand behind what they sell.If anyone knows how I could get just discs seven and eight so i have the complete collection I paid for please let me know. Again beware of faulty sets and media blasters.
2,Not what I was expecting,"An important part of window DIY is the glazing. I was surprised to see the author's very brief comments on the subject and recommended having glazing done by a hardware store or glazier. Basic book that I knew most of already or got the same information from the instructions on the back of the glazing can. Drawings were sketchy and of little use. I didn't care much for the writing style: notes stuck in the text, folksy language, similar subjects spread out in the book rather than grouped under a single heading and referred back to in other parts of the book. I am returning the book."
5,Fortunate for Bob,Wow! This CD is amazing! I listened to it at the listening station in Circuit City because I recognized him from the TV show the Bachelor. I was totally prepared to hate it...but I changed my mind immediately after listening to the first three tracks! He has incredible talent! I LOVED IT and I can't stop listening to it! Hats off to Bob! Can't wait to see you in concert!
1,Awful,"Bob Guiney is taking a poor bar room talent and trying to make money from his new-found fame. This ""Bachelor"" cannot sing, and no one should buy this album. It is awful. If you like the song Girlfriend, you probably would like the original recording by July For Kings. Bob does an awful cover of this song, and changed some of the most defining lyrics. He should keep his mouth shut...for good."
5,Real HEAT Baby!!!,"It actually worked as advertised. I use it several days a week for 30 or more minutes per session. If you leave water in it at room temperature, it will within 5-7 minutes be comfortable enough to put your feet into, and within another 5-7 be wonderfully hot. It's noise level is reasonably low even at it's highest settings. I actually called into Brookstone and spent the extra $20.00 to extend the warranty replacement out beyond the manufacturers (1yr+2more) because I can't see how I lived this long without the device. It's basically a hot-tub for your feet."
3,Recommend with reservations,"Pros - durable,high quality and consistent heat.Cons - heavy, bulky, adding of salts, oils, etc. is not recommended."
4,good product crummy company(brookstone),however Brookstone it terrible 2 emails never answered. the bath was a gift and I was unable to get brookstone to send me a traking number or to even answer my emails
3,"What, no soap?","I received this product yesterday, and tried it out immediately. It has a much more powerful action than the Homedics spa it replaced, and the heater is very good at quickly returning the water to the desired temperature. The foot rollers are pretty useless, as stated by a previous reviewer. I was disappointed to learn that I cannot put in any salts or soaks--even though the Amazon site has them listed under the spa. Brookstone's customer service told me I can't even put any liquid soap in, or the jets may clog. This takes a lot away from the pleasure of the home pedicure, hence my rating of only 3 stars."
5,Brookstone Heated Foot Bath,"I have tried/purchased more that one foot bath spa over the last 2 years looking for relief for my tired and sore feet. I hike a lot during the summer. The is undoubtedly the bast foot bath spa I have ever tried. It actually works as advertised! It heats the water to a comfortable temperature, even if it has cooled down to room temperature! The others simply don't measure up! They DO NOT heat the water and even though they advertise that hot water will stay warm, it does not.The fact that the Brookstone accomodates my size 13's and has a reasonable depth of the water is an added bonus too!"
5,THIS IS THE ONE!,"I've had two other cheaper brands of these and they never seem to hold the heat. This one is amazing! I love the heat and it works so well, you have to turn it off for as bit or it gets too hot! That's a nice switch. This is far better then the ones who get cold in 20 or 30 min. It's a bit heavier, but also has more room for larger feet...if you need that. Even if you don't need it, the extra room is nice and the height of the water if good too! I use it all the time now and the first day I put some sea salt in the water and noticed some detox effects the next day. I'm thrilled with this unit and I feel it's worth the extra money...since it has no hastle and I actually use it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing, warm, serious foot bath."
5,Great foot spa!,"I read alot of reviews before purchasing. I was a little concerned about some of the reviews I read.I bought for my wife for Christmas, and she absolutley loves it."
4,nice product,"i got this for my wife for christmas, knowing that she has her stays on her feet all day at work cutting hair and it was a great product, only thing that sucks is that it was kinda hard to clean, but it wasnt horrible"
1,Quit working after 6 uses,"I use the foot spa infrequently, primarily for helping to recover from foot surgery.I've had the unit for over a year, but have used it only about 6 times (and being careful not to add anything to the water per the directions).This morning, I pulled it out, filled it with warm water, plugged it in and started it up in anticipation of helping a foot recover from another, recent operation. The unit worked for about 5 minutes and then the air pump quit functioning properly, making only a clicking sound and providing no air jet flow.The only advice from Brookstone customer service is to take it to a repair shop.I am extremely disappointed that such an expensive unit has failed and requires repair after just 6 uses."
1,It leaks.,"I was really looking forward to a relaxing foot massage, but the bath leaked on first use -- what a mess. It did not leak from the drain plug."
3,good product with some issues,"this is my first foot tub. i don't know the performance of other type. but this one has strong enough flow. the strength has high and low two settings. the heat is only on/off. there are only two blow heads, one for each foot. massage nodes don't move by themselves. these are pretty much standard features among all kinds of foot tubs.my problem is the remote control doesn't work. i have to stop by the store tomorrow. hope it is the remote controller's problem. second, it is the deepest i have saw in stores, which gives a deep massage and i love it. water line any deeper than this may not practical because of the weight of water could be considerable for some people. however, tall tub also means the legs are restrained somehow. The solution might be finding a higher chair. Even with these problems, I like it over all. The experience has no regret."
4,Works Great!,"I have used it twice and I love it, very relaxing. I pour Johnson's foot soap in it and it's worked well so far. It's great to have the option to turn off the water heating because the water could get really hot. I love the preasure but I still think that the price is a little high. This item is a little heavy to maneuver."
5,The Clearest ANT,"Perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in English (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing I've read by Latour. In a way it's a radical break, he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child Actor Network Theory, stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work."
2,There is a story behind a story,"if anyone gave a crap and checked out the ending, it showed freddy kruger taking jason's mask into hell! This was just about a year and a half in making (well thinking about) Freddy vs. Jason. In the opening of the freddy vs jason (a great movie go and see it asap!) freddy gets jason out of hell and makes him kill people so their fear will bring freddy back! so, if you ever get this movie, watch it out."
1,"0 STARS: If you like garbage, you'll love this movie!","The beginning of this movie shows the audience how Jason is literally blown to pieces by a swat team. Does this kill Jason? No way!! Jason's heart comes back to kill some doctor and Jason goes from body to body to do fulfill his daily thirst for blood. This movie is about as lame as part VIII and part X of this series.If you think you might like this movie, think again and don't waste your time or you'll be sorry...this movie has the potential to make you retarded if you take it seriously. My advice is to stick with ""Friday the 13th parts 1-6"" (part 2 and 3 are clearly the best) and you will be a lot happier."
1,I loved the plot and the ending but the whole movie sucked!,Ok the beginning of the movie was good but the rest of the movie was just blah! At the beginning of the movie it had the whole swat team trying to kill Jason and his heart came out and stopped beating then Jason's mask is layed on the ground then at the end of the movie what I liked the most is that Freddy's hand comes out and grabs Jason's mask telling me that there's going to be Freddy vs. Jason which I already know of and well I own Freddy vs. Jason it was awesome but through the rest of the movie it was just some black guy trying to be Jason slashing everyone with a huge knife. It wasn't a good movie I really wanted to see the real Jason then just some black guy. I do own all the Nightmare collection but not Friday the 13th. I sure wish I own all the Friday the 13th series but I don't have them. This isn't really the best Friday the 13th movie it's horrible. If you want to see a good one go see Jason Lives but this one is just crap.
2,The Worst of The Series,This movie was pretty bad. I dont even know how it made it to the big screen or why Kane Hodder even accepted to play the script of Jason. Well anyways I would NOT recommend this to no one.
1,What Were They Thinking?,"When I was younger, I was a huge fan of all the great horror series: Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, and, of course, Friday the 13th. I can watch them now and laugh, especially at this garbage to which the filmakers obviously had no idea what they were doing. This used to be a great series, but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday steals basically every idea from Halloween and N.O.E.S., and it doesn't stay consistant with it's previous sequels. The plot and acting are terrible, and it never quite feels like a Friday movie, but rather a cheap imitation of one. The only good thing about this movie was the very end, and even that now seems a little silly, too."
2,BUT WHY DID HE EAT THE HEART IN THE FIRST PLACE?,"Usually when I look at a human heart, the first impulse I get is not to DEVOUR the blasted thing. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Mr. Voorhees didn't appear to have any supernatural powers in the preceeding eight (other than the proverbial return from the grave); are we supposed to believe that he just suddenly acquired a master's degree in mind control? Sure, uh-huh, and I have this tower in Paris for sale... Anyway, this soggy, overtly violent story is redeemed somewhat by its integral elements and special effects; too bad the only plot twist was used up in the first ten minutes."
2,I don't get it,"Take a look at the original ""Friday the 13th"" movie. Before getting murdered Jasons mother says: ""Jason, my only child."" Now take a look at part 9. In this movie plays Jasons sister. I think this is very confusing! Also, Jason is only in the movie for about 5 minutes. The rest of the movie is boring, with gory murders and stupid dialoges. I think Jason X wil be much better."
3,"""Not the best, but good...""","Well, this was a great ending to the saga, the scene when Jason went to Hell was pretty cool, but the movie had some flaws. For one thing, the sex scene, not totally needed, and the scene where that guy melted, that was also unnecessary. But Jason was really cool with that chrome hockey mask, and he look WAY dead and extremely creepy. So, I would only BUY Jason goes to Hell to complete your collection, but I suggest renting it before going off and buying it."
4,Amazing Basie,"A great disk, and a rare one that showcases Basie without an orchestra backing him up. Zoot fills in the gaps beautifully, particularly on ""I Never Knew"" and ""Captain Bligh"". Basie proves again his amazing ability to create an entire rhythm around a single note."
5,A Swinging Classic,"I first bought this when it was new vinyl. Thirty years later it is still an absolute favorite. Zoot Sims was a very popular sideman. People liked him personally and he could really swing. Count Basie was the ultimate rhythm section pianist and was swinging with Benny Moten before there was a swing craze. Together Zoot and the Count fit like they had been together all of their lives. The last number ""I Surrender Dear"" was a favorite of the Count's because of its complex harmonies. Here he is on organ, an instrument he had studied under Fats Waller. That number alone is worth the price of the album ten times over. Jazz was never better than this."
2,Don't Like it.,This is a very lousy and boring film. There's not much substance in the writing. I will not recommend this film.
1,How Can It Be . . .,"that two people who were so hilarious together on the publicity circuit for this film have no chemistry whatsoever onscreen? Could it be the writing? The whole boring, predictable premise? The Directing? Yes, yes and yes."
2,Disappointing humdrum non-love story,"I love both these actors, and they're both likeable and cute. But this movie was a dog. Firstly, the plot was very different than the feel of the movie you got from the trailer. Secondly, Ms. Bullock once again plays a soppy loser who orders chinese take-out night after night alone. Despite being a highly successful lawyer, her character comes across as a total loser with no confidence, just a fruity greenpeace nut. This is so disappointing when Sandra Bullock could be so much more. Why does she return to these rolls over and over again?Third, George and Lucy had no spark or chemistry. There was no love story here, just funny little scenes stuck together. The ending was very boring. They should have shown the wedding, except that Lucy's bridal getup was horrendously ugly! She looks like her name should be Agnes or something. See Sliding Doors instead with Gwyneth Paltrow, that was cute."
3,"Adefinate 5, out of 10","Average is the only word I could use to describe this movie. There was nothing outstanding about the rapport between Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock. The plot was predictable- evil money hungry man, woman out to save the world, one community center at a time, blah, blah, blah. It's a perfectly good time waster though, after you've checked out all 187 channels on the cable system.I didn't hate it, but I don't have anything else to say about it."
3,Nothing new,"Proves that even the most charming actors and the wittiest dialogue can't rescue a cliche-ridden story. He is about as believable as an executive as she is as a high-powered lawyer. And the pivitol issue of ""saving the Community Center"" is about as un-original as possible. It's pleasant enough, but takes no chances and achieves nothing noteworthy."
4,Even good if you don't like Sandra much,"I just watched this movie for the first time and now I need to buy my own copy. This movie is SO funny! I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan, but nonetheless this was a great show (and if you like her a lot it's probably even better). The writing is extremely funny and Hugh Grant gives his best performance to date. Overall I would rank this as one of the best romantic comedies, right up there with Notting Hill and The Wedding Planner and just below the Princess Bride."
5,One of the best movies I have seen in a while,"This movie was so good, I not only went to see it once with some friends, I got some more friends together and went a second time. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have great on screen chemistry. The movie is very entertaining and makes you fall in love with both characters. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance. Its something both men and women would like. I know I did!"
1,Shouldn't a comedy be funny?,"I am very surprised by all the good reviews here for this film. I sat there waiting for something to happen, but for the entire thing it was just unfunny. I cared nothing about the characters played by Bullock and Grant. I went in hoping that it would be the caliber of writing of someone like Richard Curtis on Notting Hill or Love Actually (two terrific Hugh Grant films), but this was just a complete waste of time where you want those hours of your life back. I noticed Bullock's name as a producer. I hope this doesn't mean she fudged with the script to make it ""funny"" in her mind. (Anybody remember when actress Kim Basinger complained that the writer of the script for her film Marrying Man had no conception of comedy and she decided to rewrite it? The writer she was complaining about was Neil Simon.)"
1,Please make the pain stop,"I just got home from seeing this movie,and man this is bad.They do have a couple of funny sayings,but this movie is just boring.And it seemed like it lasted way too long.Please avoid this bad movie like the plague."
5,Two Weeks Notice,Got this after renting it and I like the extra features on the DVD. Great item for the price and I received it promptly. Thanks!
2,Chemistry Between Grant and Bullock - None,"When I first saw this movie, I was looking for a funny, romantic, movie full of laughter and romance. What I got - a few funny lines, and absolutly NO onscreen chemistry between Grant and Bullock. The plot was good, but it kind of dragged on a bit. The ending didn't hit home, and overall, the film wasn't very good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, don't bet all your money on this one."
2,I already saw this once....,"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw ""the ring"" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in ""you've got mail."" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big ""oh i've always felt this way kiss""Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with Blockbuster."
4,A Funny Romantic Comedy,"This is a romantic comedy that's actually funny! Both stars are very good. No one can touch Hugh Grant for this type of role. Like every other romantic comedy, its predictable, but so what?"
5,Wonderful is too quaint for this movie!,"Julia Roberts heads the cast as a spunky, small town dreamer who falls inlove with a townie. Her sister, Kat, falls for the wrong guy while her best friend, Jo, pushes the right man away. Not all relationships have happy endings but this movie will keep you laughing, crying and rooting for all three characters."
3,Sweet but essentially unchallenging,"This film will help an empty evening pass by quite nicely.It is the tale of 3 (female) friends who work in a pizza restaurant, and their complicated love lives.The characters within it are slightly cliched, which tends to give it an unchallenging homely feel.There are few surprises and nothing that offends. Overall a 'nice' film, best served with a glass of red wine after a stressful day."
4,great buy,i love this movie. one of my favorites. julia roberts before she was really famous. hilarious movie about relationships. and i got it on an amazon sale.
5,5 gal pet waterer,"I have two large dogs and their water bowls in their stand only have about a 2 qt capacity. One of my dogs drinks a lot of water and I have to fill her bowl about 3-4 times a day. This product has been very helpful for those times when I'm away, because if they have no water, I don't worry about them having access to water. It works beautifully. I don't have an unsightly pail that they might have trouble drinking out of and it keeps the water clean. I highly recommend this product."
5,Works great!,Very nice item to keep fresh water available for few days. Just do no leave in sunshine - some people complain about algae when left in sunshine. So will everything grow algae in sunlight! Huh? Just throw in weekly in dishwasher!
3,"works great, but...","This works great. But unfortunately, my dog is terrified of the bubbles that rise after she drinks a bit of water. Now she won't use it at all. Just something to keep in mind :)"
2,Depicted wrong,Not what I expected. Has the big hole instead of the small hole for the water to come out. With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug.
3,Needs to be cleaned regularly!,"This product is as advertised and was a fair price. It works properly, but is awkward to clean. The cleaning has to be done frequently since it drinking bowl catches a remarkable amount of food and dirt. It is a good product, but difficult to maintain."
4,Great for short-medium trips,"We purchased this waterer in anticipation of a few short trips away from home over Thanksgiving and the holidays and have been pretty satisfied with it. It's easy to clean and has a simple and nearly foolproof design, which is great- no moving parts to break or jam up while you're away.That said, we do occasionally notice that the water sometimes doesn't always completely refill the basin until the level gets almost to empty, which might be a problem for some pets if they feel they need a minimum ""depth"" of water to be able to drink from."
2,FILLING/PLACMENT DIFFICULTIES....,"These pet ""silos"" are a wonderful invention to keep the ""Baby's"" bowlsfilled and to keep the owner from bending over sooo frequently!!!HOWEVER-the Petmate Le Bristo, besides being a bit ""pricey""is rather difficult to fill-or- rather difficult to place on the floor once filled.Since the product ""bottle"" dosent actually lock securely to the base, once you have filled it with food (or worse) with water, you flip it right side up.Then, you bend to place it on the floor & POW!!-it slips apart and all the cereal (or water) is spilled everywhere!!!The actual owners of this product know what I'm describing!!So once this unit is filled & placed in ""Baby's"" feeding area-all is well-BUT if you spill, you will be vacuuming or mopping for an hour!!!"
1,stagnant water,"The water definitely gets stagnant before my cat can drink it. What I like is the look of it, because I put it right next to our water machine and it looks really cute there!"
3,Mediocre,"I purchased two of these in Planet Blue, as I have four outside dogs and keeping fresh water available to them proved to be no easy task. On the side, the product is touted to be treated with ""Micro-ban"" to curb bacteria-I find that it doesn't curb it anymore than any other ordinary plastic. I recommend cleaning it out every so often, as it does begin to stink, as stagnant water does. All in all an ok, though not great, product."
4,ours broke too,"well we have had it with two large dogs for several years, inside our home... never an issue. but it will break when you drop it full of water on a concrete floor. :D sucks for us but the dogs loved it. it was like christmas for no reason."
4,"Good, but not great",It's a little tricky to fill and position without spilling because of it's size. And the Microban doesn't seem to work very well if water is left in (like over a vacation.)
2,No home should be without a Regis Philbin.,"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!"
1,No English language subtitles,"It is ridiculous that this series has no closed captioning for the hearing impaired. I am not deaf, but I require subtitles to watch while I exercise. Yes, I can watch the series while doing other things, but what about the people who have no choice in the matter?"
3,Trouble,"The 4th disc would not play properly. Sticks, then skips ahead. Other 3 discs were fine. Probably my all time favorite show, so I wasn't thrilled when the problem surfaced."
3,Great show but problem on DVD 3,"I finally decided to watch Six Feet Under once it wrapped up, and am enjoying it thoroughly. However, like the previous reviewer, I noticed a large glitch during ""Life's Too Short"" on the 3rd DVD. It froze my Pioneer player, and on any other player I have, the scene is marred by a huge glitch. I've tried 2 sets of DVDs, and both have the same problem in the same place. I wonder if this problem was fixed in a different pressing? I'm not sure how old the 2 sets I've tried are. Anyway, the show itself is worth 5 stars, but it looks like this set may have a problem."
1,Boring,"I am a huge fan of HBO series but I can't get into this one. I don't connnect with the characters, I find them dull and the whole storyline bores me. I have tried as it gets raving reviews from most who watch it, but I just don't care for it. There is not one character I even like! I love Deadwood, Oz, Rome and Carnivale. All wonderful above average shows,but this one is lacking something. It does not have any spark. I felt it is really dull."
1,Didn't Know,Too much sexual activity including homosexual activity. Too much too fast forward voiding the content of tne movie. Will not watch another season.
5,Shocking!,"After watching a few episodes of the Showtime original seriers,Dexter - The First Seasonon NBC, I immediately ordered the the complete season on DVD. The result was becoming a Michael C. Hall fan and ordering the first season ofSix Feet Under: The Complete First Season. Warning this is not for the family. This very adult series is full of great acting and shocking scenes. I recommend this series but please keep it under lock and key away from your pre-teen! Being typical hollywood, they dont miss a chance to sock it to the religious right and conservatives i.e., me. That being said, I will be ordering season two."
4,A Good Start...,"While not quite up to par with E's eels work, this CD isn't bad. Songs such as ""Manchester Girl,"" ""A Most Unpleasant Man,"" ""My Old Raincoat,"" and ""Permanent Broken Heart"" really foreshadow the lyrical style of the eels. Also, that depressing yet somehow still upbeat style found in such eels classics as ""Novacain for the Soul"" and ""Mr.E's Beautiful Blues"" can be found in Shine It All On"" and ""LA River."" ""The Only Thing I Care About"" is also a particulary catchy tune. My only complaint isn't with the lyrics, but rather with the sorta cheesy early 90's Gin Blossoms-esque music found in many of the songs. I still must recommend this for fans of the eels or even those who are interested in them and don't know where to start."
2,DOes not fit 3800 series II engine well,They state it fits 3800 Series II engine but it is a tight fit. They do not sit well over the plugs and had one melt due to improper fit.
2,"Well written, but out of date","Let me start by saying that had I purchased this book 2 years ago when it was first released, I would have given it 5 stars.This is a very well-written book, with good explanations and sample code. However, the book is fairly out of date, and much of the performance tuning suggestions he makes don't really apply as much when using the latest Oracle JDBC drivers and Oracle9 database. This book covers Oracle 8.1.6, and a lot of changes have been made between that release and 8.1.7 and Oracle9.I recommend the newer ""Oracle 9i JDBC Programming"" book by Jason Price for much more current coverage of this topic."
4,very cool,"A long time favorite of mind. There is no real porn in this movie But it does have a one of the better performances by Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry. I like the plot twist in the middle."
2,Cheesy,"Well i didnt rate it the best. If you want action the whole way threw the movie, then dont buy it. One action part turn my stomach a bit. I bought this movie for 2.99 Canadian. I knew it would be some type of a flop but hey it's only 3.00 right. If u like to laugh at cheesy things go ahead watch it. If ur looking for one sex scene go ahead watch it. To me when I watched it, the movie said to me an old cheesy, slightly porno type movie. With the cheesy lines, cheesy plot and cheesy music to me that shouts porno."
3,Suspense and Mystery,"The story is about a forsaken actor that is set-up to witness a murder, but whose murder and who set him up?This is not the first movie to have the murder of one of a set of women as the theme. Both Larry Kasdan's 'Body Heat' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' do exactly the same job and well worth imitating. However, the 'Body Double' story plays absent a very necessary amount of credibility. The film simply lacks drama.The story is suspenseful, mysterious, touches on Vampire and porn film-making, and conveniently provides sex as the substitute for drama.Overall the movie is entertaining and good. But as far as combining the devices of film making together into one whole, like Hitchcock and Kasdan did, Brian De Palma did not quite get it."
3,You can't believe everything you see...,"I first bought this movie several years ago at Best Buy on sale for about $3.99, but never actually got around to watching it all the way through until recently. I really enjoyed it-it was like watching an updated Hitchcock flick, and the music score was excellent. I may be mistaken, and if I am will somebody please correct me-but I'm almost positive that at around the 1 hour 18 min mark I'm sure I spotted actress Audrey Landers, of Dallas TV show fame, do a quick 2 second walkthru during the Frankie Goes To Hollywood music segment."
3,Blue Stompin' - Hal Singer with Charlie Shavers,"Recorded in Hackensack, N.J. on February 20, 1959, this is the only recording Hal Singer made for Prestige and one of the few pure jazz recordings in his career. A tenor player better known for his R & B style, he and the great trumpet player, Charlie Shavers have made a very listenable session. With Ray Bryant on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass and Osie Johnson on drums. When Bob Weinstock created his Swingville label, Blue Stompin' became a Swingville album until the label was discontinued in the mid '60's. Not reissued again until this CD came out in 1994. Good listening swingin' jazz, with Charlie Shavers really pumpin' it up."
4,not your usual corporate speak...fun read,"an interesting and fun read. wish there was more depth, but definetely good for a trip up the corpoate landscape."
5,Too Much FUN to pass up!!,"Waited for this DVD for years. While I agree with some other folks about the lack of thoughtfulness in presentation, easter egg hell and no current interviews with the band, my bitching stops here.I mean c'mon these videos are GREAT!! And was it me or did they contain a huge number of references to uh kinky acts? Girls on Film and the Chauffeur are downright porn. Plus, you cannot miss the S&M thing going on in Reflex. Good times, good times. Also I have to hand it to the band's artistic/aesthetic fearlesness. Check out their clothes in Electric Barbarella or how gorgeous the visuals are in Come Undone. Duran Duran is what a pop band should be, with FUN music!! Don't pass this one up."
4,Totally 80s Rewind!,"I thought this would be the ultimate 80s video collection from one of my favorite groups! I give the collection 4 stars purely for the videos themselves--boy did they take me back! I was a little surprised at the 'uncensored' and quite explicit version of Girls on Film and Chauffer. But otherwise the videos are great! I agree that the navigation is completely confusing! Took me a solid 30 mins to figure out what I was doing. I was also a bit peeved that I couldn't read the liner notes, as they were printed white on white. What's up with that? Overall it was a great D2 reunion. Can't wait to share it with friends!"
4,Brings back memories,"I got this DVD yesterday and watched the entire thing. It was nice watching these videos again. Looking back now there were crazy hairstyles, wacky fashion and dangerous locations. I think this is something that every Duran fan should own. I do wish there were some of the unpopular videos like Nightboat and Careless Memories. The interior of the dvd case is a little hard to read. Don't they know that we're older now and can't read white on white font! Also, can someone please tell me how to get to the hidden footage!"
4,I found the 17 mins version of New Moon on Monday!!!,"Bought my copy yesterday at a bargin price about $12.99. I tried to find the hidden alternate versions and then finally found a way. The 17 minutes version of New Moon on Monday is just worth every penny spent. If you can't find them, here is the tips:Try to use the function key ""display"" on your DVD remote. Select the chapters (or sections) by entering ""1"" to ""38"" on disc 1. You'll find all the hidden interview clips and all alternate versions of the video. Alternatively, put the DVD onto your PC's DVD-ROM, and play it on PowerDVD. While playing, use the function of ""jump to"", this can be done by clicking the right button of the mouse, and you can go to any of the 38 chaptors in disc 1. Same approaches can be applied to disc 2.The reason why I rate this set 4 stars is that it fails to include the promo videos, such as My Own Way, Nightboat, which originally included in ""the first 11 videos"". It's just stupid.Greetings from a Duranie in Taiwan!"
4,Great videos!,"It's about time! The true ""vanguards"" of music video have finally released the (almost) entire collection. The packaging alone gets 5 stars-as artful as you would expect from Duran Duran.My only (big) complaint is that the cd-rom content appears NOT to be compatible with Macs. If I am doing something wrong, please advise! It's hard to believe that in this day and age, someone would release a product that cannot be used for a Mac."
3,Do you believe in........ripped off?,"Finally a collection of Duran Duran videos on dvd..About time!!But I think us fans have been short changed. This is not all the videos from the band.... in fact there are way too many missing that should be on this release to link their music making through to the present day, Such as:""my own way, night boat, Meet el presidente, Perfect day, Lay Lady Lay, Breath after breath, Femme fatale, Out of my mind, Somebody else not me, Do you believe in shame? Violence of summer, Too much information....Even some long and forgotten Arcadia videos?These all could have easily been squeezed onto the double dvd.Repeating alternative versions of songs seems to be wasted space which could've been used to complete the video history a bit better.Who ever slapped this one together wasnt really thinking, or didn't bother to ask fans what they wanted to see or purchase.This is not a videology..there's too much missing."
3,Duranies Deserve Better,"The good news is, these are still some of the coolest, cutting edge videos of all time- and they still hold up, despite the goofy 80's hair and clothes. These videos were like short films; each video was a grand adventure. On the minus side, the packaging is lame- no pictures, notes, etc., and the white on white is hard to read- duh! As for the hidden tracks, they are just a pain (...). It took me hours and hours to figure out (the 17 minute version of ""New Moon on Monday"" is pretty cool, though). Also, would it have killed them to include the videos for ""Nightboat"" and ""My Own Way""? The sad thing is, Duran Duran really had no control over this DVD. It's the record company that owns the material. Anyway, it's still a treat for true Duranies to see these videos again."
4,Ok,Good service but product is a little small for my Ram truck. Got it around steering wheel eventually but doesn't cover entirely.
1,New Agers are Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.,"Dear Oh Dear... Another paganistic and beastly concoction disguised as spiritual awakening. Obviously influenced by the likes of A A Bailey, H P Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and other Beastly doers of deception. Notice the 666 slightly camouflaged but still blatantly obvious on the front cover? I urge you to read this but to be analytical and on your guard as many of the buzzwords and phrases have alternative meanings. Good people DO NOT be fooled by this ungodly attempt at corrupting the hearts and minds of vulnerable people. May the true God (not some spirit of the earth or a LSD-trip) bless you all."
3,Dominos without a Derek - Good but not the same,"The heart and fire that made Derek and the Dominos is sorely missing. Without Duane Allman, this is simply another Clapton led sound alike diversion. Duane made ""Layla"" and the album one of rock's masterpieces. He carried Clapton to a new level that he had not seen before. This album's performance is an honest effort to keep the band going after Duane's sudden passing after the release of Layla, and is enjoyable listening, but anyone has who heard the Dominoes with a ""Derek"" (Duane Allman) will be well aware of the missing brilliance of the great SkyDog. I highly recommend that you consider the expanded version of Layla with Duane and all the jams with the Allman Brothers Band."
5,Clapton not as God but as a guitarist,"Clapton's first stab as a lead singer and it shows. Many of the songs have Clapton singing with Bobby Whitlock as ""backing"" vocals. But I did not purchase this album for Clapton's singing abilities. Clapton's guitar skills are second to none and it shows in this album. My personal favorite is Presence Of The Lord where Eric's guitar playing is blistering and he seems to be more comfortable in his lead singer role. The eighteen minute Let It Rain was a bit long but takes nothing away from the rest of this exceptional album. Other highlights include Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad and Key To The Highway. This is a must have album for any Clapton fan."
4,Very handy,"The description is off, this is just a case, but a pretty good one. I can't understand why the can't change the description.It actually holds 16 cards, the Identiflyer unit and a rear pouch for the ear phone and extra batteries. It has a window in the front to insert an identification or business card. It also has an adjustable carrying strap. It seems well made and should last a long time. The only reason I knocked one star off was that some of the card slots are really tight, making it difficult to get some of the cards in but at least nothing should fall out.I recommend it to anyone that has a collection of Identiflyer cards."
4,"Where are the limits of randomness, casualty and freewill?","Through a simple story, there is a sudden twist of fate at the moment to get into an elevator instead of another. This apparently insignificance may generate by itself a completely different chain of events and circumstances that can delineate your destiny.Without major pretensions and rigorous conceptual schemes, the picture maintains an effervescent rhythm and adroit script that will hold to your seat, due its intriguing premise.Fine direction by Peter Howitt."
4,Nicley Done,I enjoyed her exploration of two different possiblities of how things would turn out.I thought the screenplay and acting was very good.
5,Sliding Doors,"Sliding Doors [Region 2]I really enjoyed watching this movie. I bought it after borrowing it from the library. Talk about love!! Yes, I would call it a chick flick."
4,"Really good, understandable movie","This is a GREAT movie. I am only 11 years old, but I could understand it. I liked how it had twists and turns, but it wasn't too confusing. And it was really funny!!Adults who are reading this, you are probably thinking, "" Well Jeez! If an 11 year old girl liked it and understood it, it must be really unadvanced.I 'm not going to see it after all."" Well,you're wrong! Remember, this movie has a rating of PG 13.And it is not unadvanced. I recomend that you see this movie."
2,Sliding Doors,The character were shallow and uninteresting. I found the premise of the movie not worth the effort to keep the side by side story lines in focus.
1,This movie doesn't deserve any stars! It stank!,"It was sick, depressing, annoying, and not to mention rotten! so that's what I have to say on the subject!"
2,Dizzying flashbacks,The movie intertwines alternate realities in a dizzying sequence that became annoying and difficult to follow.We did not watch the entire movie.
2,It's much too slow for my taste.,This film simply moves too slow for me to sit through it. I simply wouldn't recommend it to a friend
4,Sliding Doors,I realized after watching that I had seen it many years ago. Still it kept my attention and I enjoyed it again.
4,Gwyneth Paltrow yet again does another excellent job.,"This is a touching drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow as yet another Helen, who catches a train, one time she does and one time she doesn't - so she doesn't know the same person is controlling two lives! Sounds confusing, huh? But this still is a romantic, sad, dramatic film that the whole family can't miss. John Hannah also does an excellent acting job as Helen's new love interest."
5,Original and Enjoyable,"After seeing thousands of romantic comedies that rehash the same old plot line, Sliding Doors is a bit of fresh air. The approach is original and follows through well, and Paltrow and Hannah's chemistry is quite brilliant. A fun and eminently watchable film, and Paltrow's accent is not all that appalling."
4,Deep,"This is one of the movies that makes you think that they are indeed no coincidences in life and that everything happens for a reason. It also shows us that no matter which road we choose to take, in the end, we will end up exactly where or who we are supposed to be with.I first saw it when a friend recommended it to me several years ago and it stuck with me. Finally, 5 years later, I saw the DVD on-sale and bought it to watch it again. After finishing it, I thought about life again and all it's infinite possibilities of the what if's.I know it's a movie, but there are some parallel truth even to our universe. This movie is comedic, yet profound. Like Robert Frost's ""The Road Less Traveled"" - I chose the latter, and it has made all the difference."
5,sliding doors,Received item in time and in condition promised. Very satisfied. thx.xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
5,Excellent discussion film,Many people have had the experience of wondering what would have happened if a split-second event had not occurred. This film can be a rich discussion starter hearing people's stories of such experiences.
2,A clever concept.......,"....but I didn't really get that much out of it. In fact, the first time I saw this movie I fell asleep half way through. I just didn't see what the big deal was, but according to other viewer reviews, maybe I should give it another try."
3,Kind of confusing,"Kind of an odd movie. Gwyneth was pretty good. All in all, an okay video to watch on a rainy day with nothing to do."
2,RV Driver,Two senarios going on at the same time. Shallow and not that great. Sorry I bought the movie.
4,"Good, Bad, Good, Bad, Good Bad ending","The concept of the movie alone is worth watching the movie. How do lives change when you just miss those sliding doors of the subway?In this movie both options are followed in the life of an excellent Gwyneth Paltrow. The first one she stays with her cheating boyfriend, in the other she doesn't.This goes on for most of the movie. In the end there are some interesting twists.The concept and acting are great, but maybe it could have been a little better worked out. It also looks more like a tv-movie instead of a feature movie, which can be seen in the lighting."
2,Battle of the Scrawny Suitors.,"A look at two scenarios for Helen's (Gwyneth Paltrow) life: what would have happened had she made the train, and what would have happened had she taken a cab. Paltrow must have been cursed, because both scenarios involve wimpy, talky, Woody Allen-wannabe suitors. The sleaziest characters, Gerry (John Lynch) and Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn) go about their business awkwardly, without any verve, and pretty much suck most of the life out of this movie. Paltrow even manages to look unappealing in the ""made the train"" scenario, sporting a 'do that makes her head resemble a rectangle."
3,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER W/O BAD LANGUAGE,I thought the movie was brilliantly written. Although I can't seem to understand why writers seem to think that putting in bad language makes a movie better. There are so many movies that were kept clean and they got great reviews. I thought Paltrow was wonderful in this movie it took such a neat and enlightening turn. I would watch it again.
5,"Exceptionally funny, kept my interest, I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!","I am a Gwyneth Paltrow fan. I have seen everything she has been in. She portrays Helen to a tee! The concept is fresh, clean, upbeat, and well done. John Hannah is great, as well as John Lynch. The movie is terribly funny, and I have watch the video at least 30 times. I'm addicted."
2,so darn confused!!,"This book wasn't for me.I loved it at the start, but then she added at least the stories of three other characters and that confused me so darn much! I didn't feel the connection between Dev and Daisy as I did with other books. Another problem I have is that she has a lot of plot ideas that just fade out, and that really frustrated me.Dont get me wrong, some secondary character storylines can be good, but they have to be woven well together, where as this one seemed a bit random .I wouldn't recommend this to someone who was looking for a simple, heart-thudding, tummy turning romance. It was quite plain in my opinion."
3,A bit too long,"Not a bad read, but a bit too drawn out. Most of the secondary stories made me skip ahead because I really just wanted to follow the main story."
2,free list should be free,"I don't really like it when they put ebooks that cost money on the list that states free! I don't care how good the book is or isn't, free list should be free. It is very maddening when we get caught paying for a book that should not have been on the free list to start with."
3,"It might have been good, but...","What I managed to watch was great. Unfortunately, the DVD seems to be cheap or flawed and I could not manage to finish watching it due to technical difficulties. I tried it in other DVD players, I tried cleaning it, I even returned it in exchange for another one thinking the one I got was a dud, but in the end, I could not watch it past the same point in both copies. I am very disappointed. I am toying with the idea of buying the VHS version to finish watching it. Maybe I will rent it first just to make sure. The good thing is that I received all my money back, but I still want to watch it and own it..."
2,Further Tale of the City,"A very poor sequel to the original ""Tales of the City"" Poor production values, poor directing, and just a generally cheap imitation of the world of Barbary Lane. Many of the ororiginal characters have been recast, and aren't nearly up to par as the original players. Briam, Michael Mouse, and Mona have all been recast. Thank heavens Laura Linney and Olympia Dukakis repeat their roles as MaryAnne Singleton and Mrs. Madrigal, which saves the movie from total obscurity."
1,Disappointed,"I fell in love with the Glenn Close/Alan Campbell version of Sunset Blvd, and expected another spectacular production from this version. I was flatly disappointed. Close's Norma and that of Patti LuPone are comparable. Close overacts but doesn't sing well, while LuPone's excellent voice does not cover up her poor acting (I agree that she was miscast for the role). Norma aside, the World Premiere Recording is almost amateurish. Kevin Anderson's Joe Gillis and Meredith Braun's Betty belong in a high school production. Get the American version, which is more glamorous, the way an ALW musical should be. Hearn's Tony award winning Max cannot be ignored, and Campbell does a superb job with Joe Gillis. The final straw is that there are cuts in the London version, though the full libretto is provided. Buy the American recording, and enjoy it."
4,Smith shares his thoughts with extreme candor,"Dean Smith shares his thoughts on Carolina basketball and his life with extreme candor, and warmth to all readers. His candor still today can be heard on occassion on the Road to the Final Four where he isn't afraid to point out who he feels is bad and what he feels about college basketball today. If your a fan of basketball this to me is a Must Read!"
3,Can't they spell the title of the book correctly??,"It took me a couple of days to notice, but why is Frontier misspelled in the title of this book? And who published it and where are they located?"
4,good product,"Prduct was as described. Fast shipping. Love cooking with thish apron in, it does its job and keeps me clean! Pockets are nice, I just haven't figured out what people actually put in them! Haha"
2,Cheap but not worth it,"apron was NOT full length, poorly packed, and one mass of wrinkles. I will keep it but do not recommend. And very poorly made. I have not yet washed this product yet but would not be at all surprised if it fell apart."
2,On Social Anxiety,"I had the unfortunate obligation of reading this novel for a class. The characters feel like caricatures fumbling around each other with never the right words for the situation they find themselves in. Most of the book is composed of awkward dialogue, with the characters either being too polite or too aggressive. Yes, Smith is trying to convey how different people of different backgrounds clash yet still try to get along, but for the reader's sake, it would have been nice to have a little more flow to the book. The book should have been titled _On Social Anxiety: When People Who Are Different Interact_, because that is its major theme. The thing is, we don't need a reminder of how different we all are. We're living that every day. We don't need to read a novel to realize that.Lastly, I don't know what all those positive newspaper reviews were reading, but this book was not funny -- at all. I didn't laugh a single time."
4,Don't give up!!!!,I was reading this book for a book club but really could not get interested in the the first section. I am glad I kept reading as the last 2 sections were very interesting. A good book for a book club discussion.
2,Hardly White Teeth,"I found this book lengthy, depressing, and the characters incredibly unlikeable. Smith infused White Teeth with humor and characters, that although flawed were always relateable. On Beauty is just not another White Teeth, and I did not like it at all nor did anyone else I know who enjoyed her debut novel."
5,Loved it,"This book was beautifully written and flawless if you ask me. It felt so real, as though it was a simple story that could happen anywhere rather than an orchestrated plot. I really enjoyed it more than White Teeth."
4,I actually really liked this one...,"It was a little slow to pick up, but once it did, I had a hard time putting this book down. I even got sunburned today trying to finish it at the beach. Smith tackles a lot here: race relations, infidelity, religion, hypocrisy, and inter-generational misunderstandings. With some exceptions, I think she is largely successful. I found each of the characters interesting and sympathetic (or just plain pathetic) in their own ways, but I was rooting for them regardless. Some aspects of the story were a little far-fetched, but Smith is able to get the reader to buy-in enough, that it doesn't matter. This would make a really interesting movie, done right of course. In the meantime, a great summer read, with substance. Pick it up!"
2,pretty dull,"i am very disappointed in this book. after all the rave reviews i read i was expecting much more. its just rather dull. the language is stilted so it sometimes hard to figure out what they are talking about. the characters are rather flat and the ""plot"" is just not intereting. i loved white teeth but could not get through her 2nd novel. i am barely making it through this and going to the book often feels like a chore that needs to be completed. she is clearly a gifted and intelligent person but with regard to this book ... ""there is just no there, there"""
3,"Partly sunny, mostly cloudy.","Since others have synopsized the plot at great length, I won't echo their reviews. Zadie Smith has flashes of brilliance and insights into human nature which are remarkable for her age, especially when dealing with the relationship between Kiki and Carlene. Sadly, the remaining family dynamics felt implausible, contrived, and strained. Howard and Monty come off as caricatures of academecians, most painfully in their inability to control their respective libidos among nubile young coeds. Their offspring, Jerome, Zora, Levi and Victoria, are simply unbelievable, as are their choices of friends and paramours. As a Boston native, I also found Smith's fabrication of a fictitious college town somewhat off-key. Wellington? Wellesley? Across the river? Cambridge? This was a distraction, as were the myriad typos that seem to be rampant now that spellchecker has replaced the human touch. The word ""nothing"" instead of ""noting"" completely changes the meaning of a sentence."
4,well worth reading,"I enjoyed On Beauty. It is a book set mostly in upper middle class academia with some forays into lower class life. The depiction of life in academia with all the infighting is very well done. There is a dynamic between liberal and conservative philosophies that I would have liked to see more of. A lot happens in this book. There is marriage trouble, a depiction of the life of a up and coming street artist and student life at a fictional school that is modelled after the Ivy Leagues. Although I enjoyed this book I found it to be uneven. For example the disintegration and perhaps resurgence of the marriage is very interesting but the life of Carl and his conclusions about the world of academia are difficult to believe in. However, this is a minor complaint about an overall enjoyable book."
2,Black America? Southern?,"Other reviewers have covered most of what I consider problematic about this book. What bothered me most was that Kiki is a black, Southern woman with absolutely no connection to any black Southern woman I've known or seen. Other reviewers have criticized Smith for her inauthentic dialogue. The inauthenticity extends beyond the dialogue. Smith knows little to nothing about black Southerners. Her description of ""soul food,"" in the book is unrecognizable to any ""soul food"" emanating from the South. When she has Kiki reverting to her Southern roots, her dialogue, culture, etc. are markedly more Caribbean instead of Southern. The Belsey children speak slang that is Caribbean, not Southern. To some, this may be a minor point, but since Kiki's Florida roots are a central part of her character, that they weren't authentic is troubling.A sabbatical in New England does not make Smith an authority able to accurately critique American culture, especially black-American culture."
2,Where was Ms Smith's editor?,"First, this book is self indulgently long - her editor must have been afraid to ask her to cut some of the more boing bits. Second, the proofreader must have fallen asleep from the dullness - here are two examples of silly errors that should have been caught before going to press:p. 266 ""specialist boutique that might have the cane with the carved handle which that Carlene had in mind."" - obviously, ms smith didn't know whether to use ""which"" or ""that"" so put both in!p. 287 ""to laugh at the expensive pretension of bussing down Kingsmen"" - look it up, please, ""bussing"" means ""kissing"
2,Ms Smith is Overated--Confusing Read,"This book was selected for my book club group. We gave it a grade overall of D. Ms Smith is overrated. I do not understand why critics are raving about her. Her writing was confusing. She does not fully develop her characters or explain the story. The character Jerome was in love with Victoria but were never explained how this came about and why it fell apart. Her use of English (American) language was crazy. She should have written about her home instead of a place she apparently does not understand or know how to write about. She never fully explains the feud of two main characters, Howard and Kipps. People who were minor characters became major players with no real purpose to the story. It was onfusing, overdone and not that great."
2,What a Shame,"I am one third of the way through On Beauty. I came to Amazon to see if I was the only one just not getting this book. I don't care about the characters, the setting or plot. I agree with one of the other reviewer's when he said the book was long winded. I finish most books and even picked this book up for the second time to give it a chance but I just don't have the patience to continue when there are so many good books I still have not read. Once again, I should have read the reviews on the jacket more carefully and I would have realized they were for her last book and none were for this book, always a dead giveaway. I just checked my only other review and saw that in that review I recommended Zadie Smith's White Teeth. Funny."
1,Pathetic,This is not a tribute to Aaliyah. It's a failure at making a DVD. It's a pathetic attempt. And Aaliyah's memory does not deserve this. Save your money.Record her videos from VH1. You'd be better off.
2,not exactly pleased,"I was very disappointed with this dvd,I thought that I was paying for a dvd with all of her videos on it,it is also very poor quality, some of the videos that i was hoping to see was not there such as hot like fire,more than a woman we need a resolution.Also the video doesn't excalty play all the way to the end of the video it cuts of and goes into another video.Why won't somebody make a dvd that's in a better quality and has all the video's on it?"
2,What a rip,"Bought this case for the F440 camera I recently purchased. I figured for $25 it would be a good case. It is worth about 10 bucks. One, it is not padded very well, and two, it only closes with a snap button, which makes it easy for someone to pop open, especially if you attach it to a belt-something to consider if you travel a lot. Anyway, I went to Best Buy and bought a nice padded case that fit the camera almost perfectly for $8.99, and has an interior pocket for an extra battery or mem. card. I suppose it is stylish, but the utility to cost ratio is not very good."
3,it didn't fit.,"Well, when I got this basket for my bike, it didn't fit. My handle bars are apparently too curvy to secure the top part and the wheel extension part didn't reach my wheels. I'm not the kind of person that likes to deal with the hassle of sending things back (unless it sucks entirely) so instead I bought a pack of Zip Ties and secured the basket to my bike. It worked perfectly and now I love the basket."
2,inadequate description,"I just received this product. It is sturdy and should suffice; attaching leg struts to basket was quick and simple, and the handlebar brackets are just fine. The problem is that nowhere in the description does it specify that it only works for a particular type of front wheel hub. There is no warning about not fitting a ""quick-release"" assembly, or requiring a different type of hardware for that. Either make it clear that the basket will not work for certain types of front wheel assemblies, OR be kind enough to supply the alternative hardware and alternative instructions. A couple brackets, a couple screws, and another 2 paragraphs of instructions could not cost more than fifty cents, and would go a long way toward making your product suitable for more people."
3,Very basic cichlid starter book.,Good entry level Malawi cichlid aquarist book dealing with only the most common species.
1,Kipling Back Pack,"After two attempts to purchase the back pack picture on the Amazon website, I was unable to get the back pack pictured. Originally, a Belgian company, I had started purchasing Kipling products while livingKipling Ridge Backpackin Belgium. They were great looking and sturdy items. The packs now being sent or available are the Kipling back packs with the Kipling patch the same colour as the pack material. In the past the Kipling products have had a contasting patch in black with the grey lettering. They were very stylish packs/products. No longer does it seem possible to get these packs/products with this styling.As a result, I will no longer purchase Kipling products unless we can find the products with the traditional patch that has been the classic Kipling look. The new look is not a good one. Very disappointing."
1,$250 hassle aka 590A,"Pros- they look great- handy wired dongle and charging stand- very good sound quality- comfortable and lightCons- distracting blue light flashing (it's bluetooth I get it already)- slight sound lag- every once in a while signal drops out replaced by grating static sound (can be fixed by pressing the link button, but is jarring none the less).- after a few weeks the charging connector pin on the headphones became faulty and stopped taking a charge. was still able to get a charge by placing headphones at a *very specific* angle connected to the portable charging cable. annoying to say the least, but workable.- after about two months (ten minutes ago) the plastic on the headphones cracked and fell apart leaving the left earphone dangling by a wire. I was very careful with these comparatively expensive headphones and had never dropped them.It's a shame, initially it seemed close to perfect.Be aware that Plantronics does not offer refunds, only replacements."
3,Almost as slick as advertised,"While the concept for this product is perfect, in reality audio quality is poor due to the fact that this headset requires the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), which is not widely supported at this time.I thought I would be able to use this to listen to music stored in my PowerBook G4 laptop, which I would think is a fairly common use case. To my surprise, the audio quality was no better than AM radio. It was really dissapointing. I contacted Plantronics Technical Support only to learn that I would have to use the universal adapter, which defeats the purpose of having a Bluetooth headset. Plantronics needs to disclose this issue, since so few devices currently support A2DP."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I use Pulsar 590A just for a couple of days. I use it as stereo headphones and Skype headset for my PC (via Bluetooth 2.0 dongle) and as stereo headphones for my Pocket PC Dell Axim x50v (which has built-in Bluetooth 1.2). Setup in both cases was quite painless and quick. I also used the Bluetooth adapter that comes with the headphones, and it worked without problems.Until now I have just two serious issues with this product:1) Sound quality, in my opinion, is not satisfactory for music listening2) Flashing blue light on the right headphone - it is reflected on my PC screen when I watch movies and makes me look weird when I'm on the bus"
5,Exactly what it supposed to do.,"I've had my headset for almost a year now.I got it for the same price as you can get it today.....here(less than $120).I use them mainly for skateboarding, so they get put through the ringer. A fall from 12 stairs is not a good example of ""careful handling"", neither is the rather large quantities of sweat that they have to endure.I use them with my A2DP smartphone.I have used them with the adapter and my ipod, and I have used them wired on airplanes.The sound quality is good.The range is good.I don't have any cracks in the plastic.I don't have any charging issues, nor do I have battery life issues.My only complaints about this product are some design features.I don't like the left-right volume controls, they should be up and down.I also don't like the very large and conspicuous blue flashing light on the side. I look like a fricken moron. These headphones are supposed to make me look cool like James Bond.Minor complaints for a near perfect product."
3,"What some people won't do for $12,000,000","Low budget production that has uneven acting and a clever premise that never really takes off. Satirizing how far reality/game shows will go is a promising idea, but they needed a bigger budget, better acting and special f/x and a tighter script to successfully pull it off, though there are some good moments here and there.The film starts off promisingly, but then starts to drag, taking too long to get to the slashing. Let's face it, that's what we're watching a film called Slashers for, right? The second half picks up somewhat, but a little better editing might have helped. See Series 7: The Contenders for a film in the same vein that I think does a better job.Be sure to check out the ""making of"" feature in the special features section. It's fascinating, better than the movie actually. Maurice Devereaux seems like a really dedicated filmmaker, so much so that, though I wasn't crazy about this flick, I will check out some of his others."
4,Majide!,"For those of you who recognize Majide, this movie is for you. Or like the little Japanese girl getting nailed in the face by a soccer ball flying over 100 MPH with the resulting bloody explosion(MXC), we know that the Japanese take their game show appreciation to a different level. So yes this movie is stupid, and no, your girlfriend/wife will probably not enjoy it at all, but I do enjoy this quite a bit. Most of the content is old and well recycled, but the production values are good (actually high-ish quality camera and camera work), and the acting is generally passable. So my words are obviously quite inconsistent with my rating, but there is an unmistakable fun and semi-creative quality to this movie that makes it a very worthwhile watch, and, at the right price, addition to the shelf."
5,Eaten Alive- One the best cannibal movies ever made.,"Directed by Umberto Lenzi (Man from Deep River). Brings you the second cannibal movie in the trilogy. First it was Man from Deep River, then is was Eaten Alive, and finally it was Cannibal Ferox (Band in 31 countries). I think this is the best cannibal movie in the trilogy. The gore effects are great and very realistic. There is also animal cruelty that spices the movie up as well as Janet Agren as Sheila Morris is impaled in the lower part of her body (were baby are made) by a wooden dildo.This is a great movie, a must have for any cannibal collection. A word of advice do not buy the Shriek Show addition is cut. Buy the EC Entertainment version off abay.com for around the same price, that includes a way better cover."
3,Gere in younger years,"This DVD was somewhat slow in action & tended to not keep one fully awake. It is classic Gere, but I prefer his later movies."
2,If you had to pick 10 Richard Gere films ...,"Just say you were asked to pick 10 of Richard Gere's all time great films. Ok, I agree he's probably only done 5 great films so finding 10 enough would be hard. But I think I could do it. ""Breathless"", however would not be included because it is one of the most boring and ridiculous films I have seen. Back in 1983 it hit the cinemas and people went and saw it because of Richard Gere's full frontal nudity. But blink and you will miss those bits, they are so fast on your screen.""Breathless"" may be a remake of a French classic, but that does not make it a masterpiece."
3,not in widescreen as it says,"still a great movie but i ordered a widescreen/fullscreen version,its only fullscreen....boo!not the best in the series but better than the high noon sequel"
3,NOT THE COMPLETE SHOW!!!!,"I don't know what the other people above or below have reviewed but it is not this DVD. I ordered this NEW from one of the other sellers and though it is the correct DVD with all the extras listed, this is not complete.The song ""Where the streets have no name (I can't take my eyes off you)""is NOT on the DVD. It is the exact same preformance as on vhs. Think about it..was the line ""I love you baby and if its quite alright I need you baby"" ever sung? NO. It is not the complete song. I wish the reviewers would have been honest or at least watched the movie first before making their review."
2,What was i thinking when I brought this,"Remember these guys! Where are they now. There are only two really good songs on this CD. Where My homies and i'll take her. (featuring Brian McKnight) Otherwise this CD is full of fake threats and even worse rappin by two east coast artists that are trying to sound west coast. The production for the most part is a lame attempt at trying to copy the G-funk sound pioneered by Dr. Dre. Like i mentioned there are only a couple of soings that aren't forgettable on the CD. Ill and Al scratch sound like second graders when they rap, but if you like the sound of east coast rap pretending to sound west coast you may like this. Sorry if I want g-funk i'll stick with the real west coast g-funk sound."
3,An Okay Storry but...,"Object of His Affection by T.L.Gray was an okay story that should have been great! I usually enjoy the stories of T.L. Gray, but (sadly) this one reads more like a Patricia Cornwall book. I was a little disappointed. But even so, Object of His Affection is an okay read. Will I buy Ms. Gray's next book? Of course, I usually enjoy her books very much."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this mug online from Autobarn and found the interior is made of plastics and does not smell good when heated. I asked the customer service why it has the name ""stainless steel""? The person said that it is my own mistake to assume that the mug is stainless steel inside. So I have to pay the return shipping. Next time I will be very carefull when I buy things online."
2,Is it worth $70?,"Pro: I charge it with the same cable as my Blackberry.Con: About 15% of the time, the other person hears an extreme/high-pitched noise that I can't hear or acknowledge.Since I use this phone for work, home, & everything in between, I have to discard this headset. For example, think about this noise happening when I host a client conference call where I'm the moderator. Then, the mess that ensues when I hang up & all others are automatically disconnected as a result."
3,Pure enjoyable pulp!,"Pure enjoyable pulp. Vibrant characters, grifters & erudite madmen - loved it! Quite a find."
3,Fun but not on par with Sick Puppy.,"I was just introduced to Hiaasen's books this year when I finally bought Sick Puppy after much prodding from several people. I absolutely adored Sick Puppy and purchased Stormy Weather because I heard that the character of Skink also appeared in that book. While I enjoyed the Stormy Weather, it didn't impress me on the same level as Sick Puppy and it took me much longer to finish this book--it just didn't grab me. Skink is still one of the wackiest and coolest characters around and I hope to read more of his exploits some day. But the other characters in Stormy Weather just weren't people I cared to read about. Plus one of the things I loved about Sick Puppy is that it made me laugh out loud and I don't know that I laughed once during Stormy Weather (and perhaps it wasn't intended to be humorous). I would still take a chance on other Hiassen books, but I probably won't do so without strong recommendations from people I know."
2,Corny Weather,This author was suggested to me because Hiaasen was supposed to be funny. To be fair it's probably rated poorly by me because it was very different than the stories I usually read. It had it's moments and it did keep me curious to end it.It wasn't very funny and it lacked substance. What was the point of everything?
1,Nothing to care about,"Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light. Frankly, it was both of those things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down. I enjoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two. This one didn't make it for me. It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together."
3,More Hiaasen!,"ANother of Hiaasen's Florida tales with colorful, slightly weird characters who get themselves into complicated situations. THe working out is more than half the fun. THis one isnt a good as Sick Puppy or Skinny Dip but still great fun."
4,Never too Late,"Dunbar has done what many writers attempt to do which is to capture a full range of the multifaceted African American. Not only does he relate to us with southern, comical, light hearted characters, but he also explores the heart and the intimacy fit for a Queen. If is definitely a cornerstone in the foundation of American literature. I am so glad it has been preserved, but better yet, I am glad I was able to read some of his work."
5,AMAZING!,"Mr. Rutter is a modern-day Handel. Our church choir sang all 3 movements of this and, while very challenging, the end result was amazing, beautiful, and I believe touched our community."
2,Love the product but not the condition it arrived in,It was such a big disappointment to have the cd finally arrive but with a big crack in the plastic case. I wrote a note and sent a photocopy of the invoice along with the unopened cd. I am waiting for a response and hopefully a cd in top notch condition.
5,DARK SHADOWS VOL 3,"A MUST FOR ANY DARK SHADOWS FAN,IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT THE PRIOR VOLUMES,KEEP BUYING NOW,THIS VOLUME TAKES YOU RIGHT INTO BARBABAS'S ENSLAVING MAGGIE EVANS FOR NOT WANTING TO BE JOSSETTE COLLINS AND JASON MCGURIE 'S WEDDING TO ELIZABETH COLLINS STODDARD.A[SURPRISE ANOUCEMENT AT THE WEDDING] AND THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE COLLINS FAMILY!!!! DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYMORE,YOU MUST BUY IT IF YOU ARE A TRUE DARK SHADOWS FAN."
5,"Murder, kidnapping and seances!","After watching Collection 1 I found Collection 2 a lot more entertaining. Forgetting the nostalgia aspect I found the stories to be strong, well paced and not self-indulgent compared to Collection 1. The characters really come to life (or death!) and the writing has improved tremendously. Even though some cameo roles seemed cariatures they were contemporaneous and allowed the main characters to shine.The best aspect of this Collection is that the viewer gets drawn into the stories up to the razor's edge of each climactic ending and the development and continuation of other stories is cleverly delivered.I only concern is that being British I found the Customs Duty very steep but that is only a warning for UK-based fans.Yours most gracious - Steve B"
4,Details were not provided,"The book arrived on time, but I was disappointed to realize that the CD was not included and that the conditions of the book were not as expected.I would have liked the seller to write more details about the book, so we know exactly what we are buying."
4,Book Review,"I got what I paid for. Standard shipping isn't bad, product wasn't bad and was exactly as described by the seller. Trustworthy!"
5,The best BEATLES album,I don't care what anybody says. LET IT BE is the best album by The Beatles. It sounds great. But I agree with the guy who says THE ROLLING STONES are a better band. But buy this album you won't be disappointed.
2,B,The whole thing feels like a B-side to me. Not up to their usual standard. Forget for a second that its the Beatles and it loses a lot of appeal. Kind of like Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper.
2,The Stones Are This Good...and Better,"As the Beatles were releasing this album, and fading away into the self indulgent fare of their solo albums (Platic Ono Band? ugh), the Rolling Stones had yet to release their best work: Exile on Main Street. The Stones had much more staying power.As for Let It Be, it's not the Beatles worst work (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper were much worse) but it's also not as good as Abbey Road or A Hard Day's Night.Those who claim this album is ""raw"" and ""emotional"" are off base. It's far from raw with the overlay of Phil Spector. And given the fact the four Beatles were rarely in the studio together as this was being done, don't criticize Phil. Without him these would still be unspliced demo tapes. Let It Be, Get Back, and Long and Winding Road are good. Which brings up my final point. No wonder John disliked this album. He didn't contribute anything decent to it.If you're building your collection, focus on Abbey Road as the final album.2 stars."
4,"Patchy, still decent","""Let It Be"" combines the simple with the sophisticated, and because of the former, and its patchwork nature, has been unfairly denigrated. The Beatles do the simple well, altho here the simple songs are admittedly sparse. Still, there is enough in total to make a decent album.The best songs are the lovely ""Across the Universe"" (John), the title cut (Paul), and the rocker ""Get Back"" (Paul). Altho Paul has said the instrumental and vocal excesses of ""The Long and Winding Road"" annoyed him, this is still a great song, very evocative. George ships in with ""For You Blue"" and ""I Me Mine."" Not his best work, but acceptable. Filler are ""Maggie Mae"" and Dig It,"" but they are not to be taken seriously (literally; they are more attempts at humor, like ""Why Don't We Do It on the Road""). ""Two of Us"" and ""I Dig a Pony"" are simple, but pretty and fun, respectively. ""One After 909,"" written ten years previously, shows a lack of sophistication, but is OK."
5,let it be,lets face it no matter what the beatles do its great. just wait untill let it be naked comes out. best song on the album is two of us. buy it and enjoy semi
4,2nd Tier Beatles Album,"You know you're a real Beatles fan if you hate Long & Winding Road, right? OK, it's a good song, but has those maudlin strings, which is odd because this is supposed to be a raw, back-to-our-roots album.This is a fine album, but to me it rates only 4-stars because it is a notch below the ""big 5"": Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper's, The White Album, and Abbey Road. There is some lousy filler (Dig it, Maggie Mae) and annoying ""bumpers"" or whatever they're called between songs. John disliked Paul's song Let It Be and partially sabotaged it with his silly comments about ""hark the angels come.""On the plus side, it has some of the best Beatles-songs-your-friends-have-never-heard: Two of Us, I Dig a Pony, For You Blue and I've Got a Feeling."
3,"Release The Glyn Johns Mix, ""Get Back""!","This CD would have been much better if Phil Spector wouldn't have came along. Actually, three of the Beatles (John, George, and Ringo) gave it to him to reproduce for disc under the title ""Let It Be"" (Previously given to Glyn Johns to produce under the title ""Get Back""). The finished product was shown, at it's worst, on songs like The Long And Winding Road, Let It Be, and Across The Universe, drenched to death with an incredible amount strings and choirs. For instance, has anybody heard The Long and Winding Road on Anthology 3? Except for John pathetic attempt at bass, it is a very good and simple song. With strings and choirs added, the song becomes more like The Long And Winding Overdub Manifesto. I can understand why Paul was so mad at Phil. The Beatles playing and songs on this album are stil quite good, however they are presented. If the album ""Get Back"" would have been released, I think it would have been a definite 5 star album."
2,Horrible,"The Beatles never sounded so awful. The production is terrible, the songs are mostly weak and underdeveloped. They were coming apart as a group when they made this and this album proves it."
5,Billy Preston saves the day (and the album),"The Beatles / Let it Be: Yes, the sessions were a mess. Yes, Phil overproduced it. Yes, it is an odd collection of tunes. Yes, Billy Preston stepped in to make them at least be polite to one another, and then happened to save the album. Yes, this is The Beatles ""Let it Be"" album, and it's still better than what most bands produce. So let it be. This is a five star album."
4,Let it Be - dressed?,"Where to start: I was disappointed with the release of ""Let it Be-Naked"" I loved the version of ""Long and Winding Road"" on LitBN but was disappointed with ""Let it Be"". I take issue with the statement that one reviewer made that the single was better than the overdubbed guitar on the album. I believe that the raw lead on the album contrasted nicely with the almost serene Gospel feel of the song. I think 'Let it Be' with its overdubs is a better album than ""Let it Be-Naked""."
4,Not their best but what by the Beatles Is Less Than Good,"Now I am not the biggest Beatle fan on the plannet. I like their music but I like other bands somewhat more. However the Fab Four NEVER, EVER made a mis-step when they were together. For a record that was their last release, the sound is pretty damn raw and honest. The songs from The Two Of Us to Get Back are all fairly good although none of them would rank among my top 20 Beatle Songs of all time. Catchy yes, worth buying, absolutely, but this release is a little short of classic status and certainly not the 99th best record of the Millenium as other voters may think."
4,Let It Be... Clothed,"This album is somewhat problematic to review. It may possibly be the Beatles worst album, but it is still better than most rock groups best albums. It is sloppy and technically imperfect, but there are a lot of great songs here. It features three genuine classic hits; ""Let It Be"", ""The Long and Winding Road"" and ""Get Back"". The other songs are also good, with the possible exceptions of the tossed off ""jams"", ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie May"". After the Beatles couldn't be bothered to finish this album, Phil Spector was brought in to work with the tapes. He put together a rather schizophrenic album, with some songs left in their ""rough"" form, and some songs adorned with an orchestra and chorus. Anyway, while the album is not a complete success, it is still a worthwhile purchase."
4,THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM,"Let It Be has gotten so much stick over the last 30 years and why? Because it's not as good as Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road? Well not much is but this gives them a run for their money. McCartney is at his peak on this album with three of his best songs, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road and the outstanding rocker Get Back while Lennon adds the very good Across The Universe. Yes, most of the songs have been overproduced by Phil Spector but the music still shines. I'm taking off a mark because of this and also due to the fact that the album is too short but I'm telling you if your a fan of The Beatles, get this album, you won't be sorry."
3,"Depressing... yes, it's a Beatles album!","""Let It Be"" is a really sad album. The guys thought this would be thier last record before splitting up for good. Tons of problems were occuring at this time, Ringo was feeling left out, Paul felt like he was being controlled by John and Yoko, George was upset about only having a couple of songs on an album, and John was upset that no one was listening to him and Yoko. They tried to crank out this album before they split up and it shows! All the songs show the depressing feeling that they were all feeling at this time. There are some good songs that appear on the album though... like ""One After 909"", which is good, but I like the 1963 version that appears on ""Anthology 1"" better. If you like those happy Beatle love songs and exciting rock songs that you always hear about... this isn't the album for you. I would go for some of the real early albums like ""Please Please Me"" or ""A Hard Day's Night""."
3,GET BACK!,"A HODGEPODGE OF MEDIOCRITY. SOME GREAT SONGS SURROUNDED BY LEFTOVERS AND INCOMPLETE NOODLINGS (MORE OF THE LATTER THAN THE FORMER). I KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE WILL GIVE THE BEATLES 5 STAR REVIEWS IF THEY FARTED ON TAPE, BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. AN AVERAGE EFFORT. GO GET ABBEY ROAD AND RUBBER SOUL."
5,One of their Finest Albums,"This is one of the Beatles best albums, if not the best. Underrated, it was the only Beatles album to get negative and harsh reviews. Although it was #1 on Billboard, it sold poorly compared to their previous efforts. Let it Be boasted three number one singles: the title track, Get Back, and The Long and Winding Road. The Long and Winding Road is A particularly beautiful song, with the strings, piano, and the female chorusLet it Be has always been a favorite song of mine, not just by the Beatles, but by any group. If you really look at it, it was more of a mature album. Ironically, the #1 album on Billboard before this album was Paul McCartney's first solo album. This album should not be overlooked. Listen to it for yourself."
4,Let it Be: The Beatles,"The Beatles Let it Be album was one of the last albums in the Beatles rock and roll history. I feel that this album was really meaningfull to a lot of people. I feel it was originally writin to inform people that ""Hey, leave it alone! It's okay the way it is."""
1,BORING !,"This is dull ,uninteresting music.Its only revered because most of the population like boring radio music to fit into a dull boring life."
1,Honk if you are sick of the Beatles,"Let it Be at one time was great.But grow up people, it is 2005, this album is a relic, not a classic."
2,Let It Be,"This was to be the Beatles last album together realeased in 1970 this was a horrible ending for a great career. Let it be is the 2nd worst beatles album in my opinion(Please Please me being the worst) it seemed to me like the beatles were just writing and not caring if it sounded good or not the only decent track on this album is ""the long and winding road"" othere than that i think this was just a waste of time and money."
5,Some Really Great Songs,"I'm not sure why so many people consider this to be The Beatles' one sub-par album. Can I point out how great the songs ""Across The Universe,"" ""Get Back,"" ""I Me Mine,"" ""Dig A Pony,"" and ""Let It Be"" are? ""I Me Mine"" is probably my favorite of Harrison's songs, melodic and angst-y and full of meaning. ""Across The Universe"" is one of Lennon's best (I think ""A Day In The Life"" is the only one I like better). Also, ""Two Of Us"" is pretty good, and ""The Long And Winding Road"" is a major hit (though not one of my favorites).So I'm not understanding where this album fails. Like every Beatles album, this album has more than it's share of greatness and winning songs."
5,"Beatles: ""Let It Be"" remastered","If you are expecting this to sound like the Beatles have (in some cases risen from the grave) reunited, and re-recorded this album in Dolby Digital 7.1, fogetaboutit...but if you have a good system, a keen ear and are a Beatles fan, you will appreciate the magic that was performed on this 40 year old recording."
3,About as good as an album gets w/ a group breaking up,"Songs taken from the ""Get Back"" sessions of 1968-9 make up the last album the group released (though Abbey Road was last to be recorded). Even with the Beatles in the process of breaking up, there is still great music.(3 of the songs made #1)Let it Be and The Long and Winding Road are beautiful masterpieces written by Paul. I've Got A Feeling and Get Back are great rockers, and Two Of Us and Across the Universe are also worth praise.However there are 2 seemingly worthless songs (Dig It and Maggie Mae), the version One After 909 doesn't compare to the one on Anthology 1, For You Blue drags a bit and Dig a Pony just gets confusing to listen to. That leaves I Me Mine,a pretty good song , which discusses the ego problem in the group. There are some great songs, but by no means the Fab Four's best album."
3,Let It Be,"Not as good as the earlier Beatle albums (Hard Day's Night, Help) but better than Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour. This is because, with Let It Be, the group attempted to return to their rock roots that were buried beneath the lite pop, over produced, studio manufactured tracks of the mid 60s.This 1970 version, produced by Phil Spector, is only version that will stand the test of time. The 2003 release is subpar."
5,bradley gregg is a GOD!,"okies, now to you all who have seen this movie, good choice, to who wants to see it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! bradley does an outstanding performance as Cody Culp. And mainly that's all to it. This movie is a must see, it's got everything for both sexes, cody for females and war for males. Anyone wit info on Bradley Gregg don't hesitate to email me: vanessa@lyrics.com spanx"
1,Bad Download,"Be aware that Amazon has been aware for over a month that this movie won't download from their server, yet they have done nothing to fix it. You would think they would either fix the problem, or just remove the movie from their available download list."
2,uh?,"This is not your average stephen king movie. the only reason i give it 2 stars is because it had a really good start, but went down hill after that. if you like wierd alien movies then check it out. but slimy eel looking things coming out of animals butts is really not what i find scary."
1,Rotten Movie,"If you're smart, you won't even waste your time on this one. Not only is the movie cliche, it really doesn't make much sense. I never did figure out what the mute boy had to do with anything in the film. I am surprised Morgan Freeman even took part in this horrible movie."
1,bad bad bad,My friend bought Dreamcatcher from amazon and we were watching it and half way through the DVD it stop working. He did not know if he had bought a used copy or what so I got on amazon and bought a new copy of the movie because I could not wait to finish it. So I finaly got my copy in and started watching it and at the same spot it quit working. So needless to say I am still wondering how it ends
2,Brutalized the book,"This movie proves the thesis that Stephen King's books make terrible movies. Basically a retelling of the monster in the woods tale, the success of the book is in the complex and textured interweaving of five friends, all linked, all with extraordinary gifts. One is extraordinary; although the weakest in body and mind, he is the strongest in spirit. The movie misses all of this, and butcher's the ending. This is among King's masterworks, and the movie does it little justice. Morgan Freeman, usually a strong enough force to carry a script on his own shoulders, is wooden and stereotypic. It might take you longer, but I recommend that you spend a couple of days reading the book than trying to make sense of this hacked up and bland rendering."
1,nightmare catcher?,"good golly, is this movie terrible. am i the only one who freaked out (in a bad way) when my dandy five-man drama exploded into a terrible sci-fi epic too terrible to even land a deal with the sci-fi network? this is two ( or 3 or 4) movies in one. and none of them are good. stay far, far away."
3,It's OK,"Most of SK's novels are far too detailed for movies, or at least so far they've foiled any director's attempts. This one wasn't really bad, on its own. The alternate (original) ending contained on the CD is better than the one tacked on to the movie, and the one in the book was better than either of them. Read the book."
1,One word says it all.......... Horrible,I won't waste many words to describe this 147 minute long movie.One word says it all... HORRIBLE.This rates among some of the worst crap I have seen put to celluloid in years..... The cinematography and effects are top notch but like virtually every film adaption of a Steven King story ever done (except Shawshenk Redemption and Carrie) this movie is terrible.My wife asked if Ed wood was still alive while watching it.. that should say enough.Whew...... bad....bad ....bad.
1,"Stephen, how could you let this happen?","I loved this book, and I was bitterly disappointed by this half-assed retelling for the silver screen. Some people will probably say that I'm being unfair rating in comparison to the novel, but it's not true. I think I would've hated this movie even if I hadn't read the book. I actually had the misfortune of seeing it in the theater. I haven't watched the DVD version yet. There's supposed to be an alternate ending. I'll have to check it out, I suppose. I hope it's better then the one they used.The first hour or so is pretty good, but then it degenerates into a really sleazy gore, suspense flick. None of the really cool scenes from the book were used. Not even the really funny cafe scene where Mr. Gray murders the state trooper. It's just a low down dirty shame."
1,Awful!,"I can't even descibe what was wrong with this one... You'll just have to see it to believe it. To be fair, I did watch it all the way through, and when the film was finished, I couldn't figure out what I had just witnessed. To say it was juvenile in scope would be an understatement. While I don't exactly care for the literature of Stephen King, I can't imagine how he could have been responsible for something like this. Kids, the bottom fell out on this one."
1,Dreamcatcher,"Ive been watching alot of King movies lately and I must say this has to be one of his worst films. The movie is a mess and I could hardly tell what was going on half the time. He takes elements of some of his best work and weave it into this story but it doesnt work. If you want to watch a King movie about four friends watch the timeless Stand By Me. If you want a movie about friendship and a little horror mixed it, watch It. This movie just plain sucked."
1,garbage,"The first 10 or so minutes of this movie were ok. It was the rest of them that sucked. The idea was pretty good, alien comes, people die. Had it not been blogged down by so many plot holes and just plain goofy situations, it just might have been good. Morgan Freeman, who usually is lights out when it comes to acting, really screws up here. Attempting to play that token over the edge army guy, he slips about a billion times, i never bought it. The one scene where i pretty much gave up all hope in this movie pulling a comeback was when Thomas jane calls Jonesy on the gun...i mean that was just stupid, especially that Tom Sizemore was not the least bit weirded out. The end was weak, especially for Stephen King. I actually thought to myself before it happened, ""What could be the worst possible way to end this movie?"" and then that idea occured in the movie. Weak, pointless, and all out disappointing. So much more could have come from this movie, yet it took the low road and collapsed."
2,I bought it; stupid me.,"I was really looking forward to this movie, since Dreamcatcher is my favorite Stephen King novel. Kasden, Freeman, Sizemore...how could you go wrong. Well, I wish I had rented instead of purchased. The characters are very shallow in the movie, a byproduct of making a huge King novel into a two hour flick. The characters in the book are what makes the read so compelling. Without the depth of the characters the movie becomes a paint-by-numbers exercise.The aliens look slick in the film which is a plus. The acting is good by everyone involved. The rest of the film is thin. Even if I hadn't been a fan of the book I would still be disappointed by this movie.Save yourself some money and rent this one if you really need to see it."
4,Better than Most People Say!,"Good Acting and Great FX are what stick out about this movie, although Morgan Freeman was underused. The script does get jumbled up as the story progresses, but this is done more in the style of a 60 million dollar B movie. I just watched it and had a good time. Sometimes I was even laughing at how bad a scene was, but it is great to watch as just plain entertainment. The Special FX really shocked me, because there are plenty and they all look great. Give it a rental."
1,Good Lord this movie is awful.,I can not get you far enough away from this movie. Made the mistake of renting it on DVD and feel cheated out of $3.95 and the 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back. I cringed at the dialogue throughout this movie. The acting was horrible. The delivery of lines was forced. The editing (or lack there of) was bad. The transitions between scenes were a laugh. Morgan Freeman's performance in particular was ridiculous and over the top. There was absolutely no suspense. Zero character development. You find yourself not caring about any of the characters and just hoping that they all die quickly to bring the movie to a swift end. No such luck. I sat for 2+ hours waiting for something to get better or to realize that I was missing out on something. I wasn't and you won't be either. Skip this movie. Rent Alien instead.
2,Will leave you wondering.,"And not in a good way. There were so many things that were not explained in this movie even though it was over 2 hours long. Perhaps the book could help to fill in the clues. Also, there are weird parts in the movie that I assume are supposed to be funny (ie., the one guy uses a gun like a telephone to communicate through esp) but they just wind up being strange. This movie was not at all like I expected it to be."
4,Gift,This item went to another person. It was on their wish list. They hve informed me it is very good.
3,"ok, i'll buy the book","if you go back in the list of reviews here, you can read the author's own review of his book. its mainly a rebuttal to another person's review....reading the author's statements in that review is enough of a taste of his writing and wit to convince me to buy this book.Thanks, Ed. You just sold another copy. More writers should do this on here."
1,Did They Ever Have the Real Thing?,"Various reasons are given for leaving the faith. Some, for instance, clearly bought into humanistic ideas. Others fell into sin. However, most if not all of the authors in this anthology testify to once having ""gone up to the altar"" and ""feeling saved"". Is it possible that they mistook an emotional or cultural experience for a real receiving of Christ as Savior? Or, as the Biblical Demas, did they simply fall in love with the world?"
1,Not a positive book,"This is the only book I have ever actually thrown out! The book lists all the reasons that the Little Critter is having such a terrible day - only the reasons aren't really terrible (such as having to eat oatmeal instead of sugary cereal) or they are the consequence of some action by the critter (he leaves his toys out and they are damaged). The ""happy ending"" is that everything is OK because the Dad buys the critter a new toy. This book sends a variety of terrible messages to children."
3,Better for flush cut sawing than dovetail,"The blade seems sharp to get the job done. While it is advertised also as a dovetail & detail saw, it works best for flush cutting dowels. If you plan to do Dovetails and similar work invest in a dedicated dovetail saw because they are reinforced across the top, unlike this one. When I tried cutting a few dovetails with this saw it bent several times resulting in a crooked & crinkled blade."
2,"Slippery handle, blade dulls quickly","When I got the saw, I thought: is this really the thing that everyone's been raving about? The blade looked good, but the handle is cheap plastic, and it's slippery. It's easy to lose your grip on the pull stroke, and, worse, it's possible for your fingers to slide forward onto the blade on the push stroke. Plus, the saw is starting to feel dull after fewer than 10 cuts - and I mean small cuts, mostly through pine.Note: The red dot on the handle let me to expect that the blade could fold into the handle, like a pocket knife. That seemed like a handy way to protect the blade so I could keep the saw in a toolbox. But no, the blade does not fold. That's my mistake, so it's not part of the reason for my two-star rating, but I figured I'd mention it in case someone else out there had also assumed that the blade could fold."
3,"Fine for doing cross-cuts, but not sure about dovetailing.","The teeth on this product are for cross-cutting. For making dovetail cuts, you need to have teeth for ripping, since you're cutting parallel to the grain. And the teeth are not aggressive enough for letting the saw do the work. I am cutting on the pull stroke and letting the blade do the work, but it does take a very long time to produce a cut. However, the kerf is nice and thin.For cutting dovetails, I recommend a pull-saw with a more aggressive blade and with rip-teeth... one of the double-edged pull-saw, one edge for ripping, and the other edge for cross-cutting. I bought a double edged Bear Saw from Lowes, and it's much more effective, and produces a straighter cut.It's fine for smaller applications like cutting dowels, because the teeth are made for cross-cutting, and perhaps cutting small architectural models, but for dovetailing, you need a more aggressive pull-saw with rip-pattern teeth."
3,disappionting,"this a great movie -what a shame they did not re-channel the mono soundtrack The transfer looks good, it was one of the best photographed movies of that period.I don't know why, but I was unable to access the menu and see the extras - tried on two players."
5,"Should I upgrade to/ or purchase this blu-ray version of the ""Big Country"" ? (explained)","Well the short of it is; if you have a HD Home Theatre (the bigger the screen the better, I have a ten (10') HD wall sreen an a 1080p Projector with 5.1 Dolby surround sound) This Theater provides the tools to recreate the BIG SCREEN CINEMA EXPERIENCE!!!!! And finally if you love Classic Westerns YES, YES, YES do purchase this wonderful 1958 All-Star Western Legends Metro Goldwyn Mayer HD blu-ray movie!!!If you already have this movie on Standard DVD and are happy thats all you need!!!Special Features on Blu-ray add an 8 minute clip titled ""Fun in the Country"" narrated and hosted by Jean Simmons. Very nice addition plus a Tv Spot. Theatrical Trailer in included like the Standard version DVD.Bottomline: welcome to the world of the ""BIG PICTURE"" and the panorama Cinemascope of ""THE BIG COUNTRY"". I love it!!!! Buy it and experience what was in the original theaters in 1958!!!!!!!! Enjoy!!!"
1,Inferior quality DVD,"I bought this movie because it ia my favorite western, however after watching it without any problems, it will no longer play. It was handled with the utmost care, no scratches, didn't touch surface, next time I inserted it, just would not load. All of my other DVD's work fine.The Big Country"
3,The Music Is Good....,"Gregory Peck, one of my favorite actors, seems uneasy in the role of an Easterner who tries to become a part of the rough-and-tumble West. Charlton Heston, also a favorite, is a little too stiff in his part. Both Carroll Baker and Jean Simmons fare a little better in their stereotypical parts as ""frontier women.""However, the two old pros, Charles Bickford and Burl Ives, walk away with the acting honors. Their characters' mutual hatred and their respective efforts to usurp the other make this a semi-worthwhile viewing experience.And a pre-Rifleman Chuck Connors is delicious as Ives' malevolent son. This role was a far cry from his ""goody goody"" Lucas McCain."
4,The Big Country,"It sure is ""a big country""...Peck is his best in ""TO Kill a Mockinbird"", but this good too. Burl Ives steals the show and a lot of ""holes"" in the story..but great cinamatogpy, and super music score."
4,Big beautiful western,"DVD quality is superb, with no compression artifacts - excellent for a movie that runs 2 hours 46 minutes. There are a lot of white spots on the film that were not ""cleaned up"" for the DVD mastering, including some that stay in the same place for several minutes, but nothing so bad that it detracts from the picture. There is also some variable brightness that flutters slightly, as towards the end of the reel that ends at about 2:15:00, but for a nearly 50 year-old film, it is in very good shape. Anamorphic widescreen; sound and music is monaural. Cinematography is gorgeous, but biologists will notice the obvious continuity errors between the California Sierra foothills and the Arizona desert localities. A classic ""must have"" movie with a classic music score."
3,Image Quality Of Main Title Sequence On Bly-Ray Disc Poor,aside from the fact the audio tracks were not given a 5.1 remastering forthe blu-ray disc which i thought was standard procedure by now the imagequality of the main title sequence was quite uneven. the entire sequenceespecially the close ups of the horses looked like the color was bleachedout. the image quality only gets to what you think it should be when thefilm proper begins. why does the main title sequence look so faded?also i am now quite weary of blu-ray discs from 20th Century Fox Home Videothat are from the MGM/UA catalog. 20th Century Fox Home Video botched theblu-ray disc of THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and now word as that the blu-raydisc of WEST SIDE STORY is just as bad. in fact Robert Harris the premierefilm restorer in the U.S. has even gone as far as to say they should recallall copies already shipped out. if Harris has that reaction it must reallybe bad.
5,the big country,onw of my dads favs. i bought it for him for christmas he was so excited he had been looking for it everywhere
5,Dogs luv them,"We buy the larger size tendons and use a pair of hand held garden tree trimmers to cut them down. We have two toy poodles and they love them. Once they are cut down to about 3"" strips they are a perfect size for a snack.Beef Tendons 1 lb. - Large"
1,Dogs would not touch it,"Perhaps our persnickety dogs are just way too sophisticated to try dog treats, probably preferring people treats. Nevertheless, neither dog (a corgi and a lhaso apso) would touch this stuff. YMMV."
3,Choose Something Else for Heavy Chewers,"Our dog loves Bully Sticks and the Chicken Jerky that Costco sells, so I thought this would be a great treat. Unfortunately, he is just a ""goat"" and he didn't chew these thoroughly. They caused quite a bit of intestinal distress. If you have a dog who is not a ""piggish goat,"" then these should be fabulous!"
1,Upset Stomach,"While my dogs loved these, several hours after eating one they both vomited. The next day I gave them each another one and they both vomited again."
3,Babies attack.,"I disagree with the former reviews.... I thought that the movie was entertaining, and had a good soundtrack..... The movie made use of all the characters in-depth. Im not saying it is perfect, but lets be realistic, not many are. I think that it is entertaining enough def. to watch and buy."
3,"Silly film for adults, but the kids love it","Well, I have to say, my oldest daughter started watching this when she was quite young, about the age of the majority of the cast and she LOVED watching the babies doing everything from talking to ninja-style acrobatics. She showed no interest in any other film that wasn't a cartoon or something like Sesame Street. Now that she's 6 years old, she and her younger sister and brother pulled it out again as a refresher because now I have to sit through Baby Geniouses: Superbabies in the theater this weekend. If they're happy, I'm happy."
1,Wretched beyond comprehension,"One truly wonders how movies such as this get made, and how respectable actresses like Kathleen Turner somehow convince themselves that taking roles such as this are actually good career moves.This is truly dreadful stuff. If someone you love suggests renting this movie to watch at home, I would say it is high time to give your relationship a serious re-evaluation.This garbage is angling for a spot on my list of the 10 worst movies I have ever had this misfortune to see. Burning every copy of this film would be doing humanity a favor."
1,Diaper gravy is right,"This is one of the most embarassingly awful movies I have ever seen. It makes the movies watched on MST3K look like cinematic masterpieces. I work at a video store and have seen several people on different ocassions actually BUY this movie! I wanted to punch them out and put some sort of sense into them. If you buy this movie for your kid because he likes it, you are making a mistake. It is rubbish like this that makes kids shoot other kids. Buy them a good family movie like E.T. or PINNOCHIO. ANY thing but this TERRIBLE MOVIE. Bob Clark makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. They say the phrase ""Diaper Gravy"" not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES in this movie, as if the first time wasn't enough. This movie should be deleted from mankind's memory. Just DON'T BUY THIS EVER."
2,Baby Geniuses cost me some brain cells,"I can't believe that this movie had such a great cast, what were they all thinking when they decided to appear in this unintelligent, stupid film. Nothing about this film was good. I don't even think little kids would enjoy this crap. It's a bad rip-off of ""Look Who's Talking."""
1,Poorly designed,"I wanted to like this product. After all, the aesthetic is great. Unfortunately it is poorly designed, mainly for one reason: the rear wheels are too close together and thus interfere with my daughter's feet when she's trying to walk.Yes, yes, I know that technically she's supposed to sit in the seat and ""scoot"". However, kids will likely want to do both and they can't.It would have been easy to design this product for both uses. The rear axle could have been made as wide as the font axle. Or better yet, include two rear axles in the packaging and let the parent choose which to employ."
1,heels get caught,"I thought this would be perfect bike for my little daughter, but the bike is poorly designed. Every time she tried to push with her legs, her heels got caught on the back tires. And the seat is really far away for the target age. I don't recommend this product."
2,Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels,"My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. At the time she was 15 months old. She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat. She quickly learned to climb on and off and go forwards and backwards and loved her bike. The steering was a little stiff and took a while for her to get the hang of it.As spring came we moved outdoors and she got better at steering. She grew so I moved the seat to the second setting. Now, at 18-20 months, the bike isn't so great -- when she tries to go forward, the back of her feet hit those rear wheels - every time! I've tried every height setting on the seat and it doesn't make a difference. She always wants to ride her bike, but gives up after just a few feet - who would want their feet to get hit all the time! The rear wheels are just a few inches too close to the seat.We will be looking for a replacement. Disappointing."
1,I returned mine,"Unfortunately, we had to return this bike. I assembled it and I have assembled many toys, but all 4 wheels would not sit on the ground. One wheel was never touching the ground. I called radio flyer, they were very nice by the way, and they re-sent me some parts and the problem still existed. I even had my father try, who is a boat builder by trade, and he had the same problem. Aside from this problem, the steering was very stiff and the wheels did not move freely enough, thus my son quickly lost interest. He was just shy of 2 at the time."
2,don't believe the hype ! !,"theres been some great reviews of this flick but i wouldnt trust them all. this film starts out great but goes down hill quik. the one arm boxer isn't believable at all. there's one scene with another one armed fighter where he falls on his back and you can see his missing arm tucked behind his back. its so bad. the fight scenes are very slow and the fighters come like a foot away from actually hitting each other. those two things made the film crap for me. i just couldnt buy it. i did love the villian, and thats about it. RENT before you Buy ! !"
3,Not so great,"Except for Roy Haynes' incredible drumming, not much is really noticeable or outstanding in this CD. Of course Booker Ervin is always up there and solid, but not much in terms of ideas and/or emotion.The whole thing seemed to me at best pretty flat and at worse pretty boring."
1,WEAK...BUT VERY TRENDY,1) NOT GOOD WITH WINDOWS2) FROZE3) OVER PRICED4) NO RADIO5) BATTERY LIFE POOR6) BODY IS NOT VERY DURABLE SCRATCHES EASY7) DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE8) NAVIGATION IS GREAT!9) SIZE IS GREAT!
3,Be Careful,"I recently ordered a silver 4GB for myself and a black 4GB for my husband. The silver one has the new case which is much sleeker, lighter, and has curved sides. The black one is in the old ""body style"". I think Apple must have had a bunch of these laying around and decided to use them for the supposed new generation. Since silver is a new color, this was not an issue."
1,CRAP... no what i meant was IMPOSSIBLY SMALL CRAP,"This ipod is by far the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. It scratches soooo easily, it makes it look a year old after the first week. It is ridiculously small, i almost lost it twice, why is it so small? its so impractical. A few other points, you can only charge it when your computer is on, which sucks if you or going on a vacation or something. The earphone slot is on the bottom, which almost forces you to buy the ipod earphone accessories that apple sells, as well as the case and probably the dock as well... -.- If you are going to buy this, don't count on the initial $249 being the final price. you will have to pay 30 for the cases 40 for the earphones and another thirty for the dock. altogether it will be $349 plus tax >:( not good. look but do not touch!!"
4,Slick!,"The black iPod Nano is perhaps the most slick portable music player I have ever seen. It looks far better than its white version, but it does scratch easily. If you want a good and sleek music player that lasts long and continues to look good, I would suggest wait till its accessories come to the market (most importantly, durable covers similar to the ones for the Mini). I would think they should be hitting the market fairly soon. However, if you want a new toy to brag to your friends about, get it now before every other person is seen with it! (PS: For those who own a Bose sound system for the iPod, you'll be glad to know that the Nano is compatible with it...you don't need to spend anything extra!)"
1,Nano needs materials rethink,"I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device. This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt. The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected. I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front. Damned annoying.Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it. Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed. You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you won't buy one."
1,No marks for all the marks,"I love the ipod.I've had an iphoto for a while now and its great.I got a ""nano"" expecting the same quality albeit with a little less memory and bulk.It works but after only a short time 4(days)it looks like its been through a war.Despite treating very carefully the thing is covered in marks and scratches.I disagree with some of the other comments listed here where people ask what do you expect.I expect after four days that something I pay over $200 for looks relatively unused.I'll be returning mine.Hopefully I'll get my money back.Don't get me wrong, I love ipods but this is a disappointment....at least the screen didn't crack as a friends allegedly did."
1,DEFECTIVE!!,I bought my REFURBISHED 4gb ipod nano. it didnt last even three months. REFURBISHED = DEFECTIVE .very disappointed with the seller. i really hope to get a refund
1,iPod wannabe,this ipod is bootlegg rly. its just too small. i like the ipod mini (i have in blue) and the regular plus photo iPods. this one is stupid. it only holds 10000 songs and for $250.... you can get a better ipod mini for $185 or 3000 songs for $250. i think its better to get the other versions of iPods.
4,"Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching","It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best."
1,no where to be found,"apple is worse than microsoft. at least some people can still get the xbox 360 as they are trickling in. this stupid nano has been sold out for the last couple of months everywhere. its almost like apple decided to stop making them or something, this is rediculous. no information can be found as to why there is a shortage."
2,Great stories but....,"I bought the Kindle addition. Of couse the stories are great and i would rate 5-star but the text is filled with type errors. One other reviewer wrote there are no typos, but there are many. I own a hard copy of all of stories so it is easy for me to check. I didn't notice it at first, probably because of the many Britsh words and usages, but now it has become quite annoying.Also someone wrote there is no index. There is but it isn't the easiest to get toThe text to speech is terrible.Like I said, great stories. The price is right but look for a differnt version."
4,Complete But Not Great,"I purchased this EXACT same copy for $20 @ Barnes & Noble last summer... it is definitely a handsome book, but not worth anything near the $110 list price on here! I doubt the cover is genuine leather and the embossing is already beginning to peel on my copy; even though I read it often, I was hoping it would stand up to wear and tear a little better than it has. There are also several typos and very annoying ""fixes"" to a few of the Canon inconsistencies, such as the changing of the dates in Wisteria Lodge from 1892 to 1895.This is a great starter for someone who wants to read the complete short stories/novels, and does spruce up the bookshelf, but not the greatest or most accurate version. Besides that, the small print was hellish on my eyes."
3,Ok for the price,"This book certainly has all of Conan Doyle's Holmes stories and is easily searchable. I have two complaints: 1: there are lots of textual errors in the copy and 2: Doyle's original maps and drawings have been left out. If you are only interested in reading the stories, then this book is a great deal. On the other hand, if you are a Holmes conisseur, I recommend you spend a little more money and get a better edition."
4,Need glasses? You will...,"Awesome collection of classic Sherlock Holmes... Great read aloud for my 12 year old. However, I had to put it down after 1-1/2 stories because the text is truly microscopic. Not so small to never be read, but a good week or two for eye resting is recommended between stories."
3,"""Complete"" collection NOT COMPLETE?? - Kindle","I just downloaded the Kindle version last night, and was a little perturbed once I reviewed the table of contents (yes, there is one!) and saw that the last couple short stories, which are from The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, are the only 2 from that collection! There are 10 short stories MISSING from this ""complete collection"". I noticed in some older reviews that 56 short stories are referenced - is this a newer version that only has 46 short stories? I think it's an excellent price ($0.99) for MOST of the collection, but I've knocked off 2 stars for the blatant false advertisement of being the complete collection. Now I'm going to have to spend more just to get the rest of the Case-Book. Disappointing."
5,What can I say that has not been said?,"The Sherlock Holmes Canon, all of Conan Doyle's original stories, all in one volume... what can possibly be better? Fresh as they were the day they were written, a challgenge for every original thinker and logical reasoner... and shedding an interesting light on Victorian London in general. A must."
5,the kindle edition does have a table of contents!!!,"this is a great book on the kindle. i was reading reviews prior to buying this and one reviewer, rather close to the top at the time i am writing this, claims that the kindle edition has no ""table of contents"" making the book difficult to read, or as he/she puts it, ""jump to a short story baised on title"" anyways after buying it despite this percived flaw, it took me a whole 30 seconds to find the table of contents, so in a unusual whim i decided to share the secret with you. first go the the home page which displays all your books. second highlight the book in question. third scroll right once using the arrow D-pad thing. fourth scroll down to the ""go to location"" tab. lastly select the ""table of contents"" option from the following menu. Then you can jump around as much as you like based on the different headings! by the way i am really enjoying this book so far and hope that this helps other kindle users :)"
1,stinks,"This wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it was close. What it had to do with National Lampoon was never clear, the humor was infantile, and the plot was idiotic."
5,Best handsaw I've ever used,"Whenever I would buy a handsaw, I would typically get one of those large saws with large handles and large blades. Before long they would become dull and useless. I have used this Shark saw, along with a similar Shark saw, to cut several types and sizes of wood. It cuts quickly and easily. The cutting is done on the pull stroke (only) which results in far less bending of the blade. In fact, once you get the hang of it you may find that the blade will never bend during use. Every cut I have made has been clean & straight with little or no splintering of the wood. Keep in mind that this saw is not meant for heavy-duty use. It is designed for making precise cuts in smaller pieces of wood such as plywood, moulding, trim, lattice, etc. You could probably cut 4 x 4's, 2 x 8's, etc. But that's not what it is designed for. Along with my other Shark saw, this is by far the best handsaw I have ever used."
4,Blowin' the Dust Off Power-Pop Wannabes,"On their 2nd album, The Shazam--led by songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Hans Rotenberry--lay stake to their claim as the foremost power-pop combo currently performing. Not satisfied to merely adopt the conventions of power-pop form, The Shazam dive deep into the style's rich history and make its best elements their own. From devastating full-charged rock (""Sunshine Tonight""), goofy fun (""""ChipperCherryDayLilly"" and ""City Smasher""), to the songwriters' tour-de-force (""With You"" and ""Super Tuesday""), The Shazam demonstrate a full command of the elements which make power-pop the most exciting rock genre available. Where other bands tend to write from a one-dimensional perspective, Rotenberry embraces all that is pop and shamelessly makes it his own, taking cues from Cheap Trick, The Move, Brian Wilson and others from pop's elite. Not to be missed."
1,Playboy's Blue Collar Babes,Don't be deceived by the front cover! Jennifer is only a narrator in the video! What a ripoff! Last Playboy Video I buy without a preview. Bottom line: Don't waste your hard earned bucks on Playboy videos!
2,The Author Has An Odd Fascination,"I read this book in law school. The author rejects the whipping post, and instead, recommends administering electric shock to criminals as punishment for crime. What good is that? Shocking someone months after the bad act is committed is not going to create any bad associations or cure any misbehavior."
3,Take the time to find an out-of-print edition of this book,"The Pulpless edition of this book is so riddled with typos that is all but unreadable. The book is spoiled because, it would seem, Pulpless decided to save money on proof-readers and just pass it through a spellchecker instead. This is not a small complaint. Simon Hawke should be made aware of this. A good book can be ruined this way. We want to read the book, get lost in the story, not be constantly yanked back to reality by horrible mistakes in printing, like using the word ""ham"" for ""his."" These mistakes are all through the book and get worse towards the end.Zero stars for Pulpless.com"
4,"LOTS OF FUN, LOTS OF TYPOS, BUT A GREAT READ!","I was very surprised by this book. I had never heard of the ""Time Wars"" series and bought it based on the recommendations I read on Amazon. I was not disappointed and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, the text is rife with typos, but still I found it to be a great read and a lotta fun. If you're interested in fantasy, sci-fi, history, historical legend, and action all rolled into a fascinating (and original) time-travel story then you'll like this book. I deduct 1 star for all the typos though... they gotta put out a proofed edition."
3,Great kids movie,"My godson started watching this movie, which we bought when my 14 year old daughter was much younger. He loves this movie and is driving his parents crazy with it, so I have now ordered the other two so there will be a little variety. He is almost 4 and sometimes watches this 4 or 5 times a day (if he can get by with it). A great movie for your children!!"
2,Disappointing,What was funny many years ago is not funny anymore. The Honeymooners had been my favorite TV show for years but I found it silly and boring as did my husband. It mainly centered about Jackie Gleason playing all the characters he was famous for- all in one episode. Even Art Carney wasn't funny. There are several other episodes on the DVD but I doubt if we will watch them and it will probably be donated to the public library. We were all ready for a good laugh but when the laughs came they were almost forced.
3,The Holiday Honeymooners Classics,"This DVD has two Holiday classics and two bonus classics. If you have the The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes (1955) There is no need to buy this DVD, the episodes are already on the The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes (1955)"
5,Jackie Gleason - Honeymooners Holiday Special,"I owned this on VHS but wanted to have it on DVD. This is definitely a classic we watch it every Christmas. Jackie Gleason portrays several of his characters in the Christmas Eve first show. Reginald VanGleason is the best, we crack up everytime we watch it. Also, the Poor Soul who has nothing, the Beer Delivery man who goes to the wrong apartment. Too much fun definitely want to see this one. Plus the DVD had bonus shows we never saw before with Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey performing."
5,B-E-A-U TIFUL!!!!!!!!,"I only have one meygan, the Funk n Glow one, to be exact.Well One night my dad and i went to target , and i saw her *gasp*! she was soo pretty and cute. She looked nothing like my old meygan. This meygan has soft-orange-colored hair , beautiful! and her eyes and lipstick color match her outfit..(also beautiful!)and her hair isn't light like my old meygan.So i bought her last month, and i took her to my friends house, and when i brought her back home in my bratz case, *gasp again*, her hair was a wreck! i was so disapointed. Her hair got all fuzzy and messy. But then i thought of a way to fix it!All you have to do it part her hair as if you were going to put 2 ponytails in, then braid. After an hour or so, Take out the braids, *lightly* brush her hair and wallah! back to normal!I LOVE MEYGAN!!! BEST MEYGAN I EVER GOT!P.s. i was wondering if meygan was in the movie. I think she's in the movie, but not a main charater. If she's not, im super happy they made her anyways! :)"
2,White Bread Jazz,"These ""with strings"" albums were designed to appeal to the larger white audience and, sadly, they generally worked. They gave the buyer the feeling that they were really ""with it"" by buying an album by a true Jazz star. But it was and remains an illusion. Hefti's schamltzy arrangements eviscerate the Jazz elements from the music, rendering it an anomalous, dessicated mush. The two stars I give it are for Brownie who shines through even against the overwhelming obstacle of these arrangements. It is a crime that great jazzmen like Brownie (and Bird) had to resort to this in order to reach a wider audience and make some decent money."
1,Blues?,"Tiny (God rest his soul, must be long gone by now. His guitar playing reminded me of what one Roy Clark special ($29.99) plus shipping and handling must have sounded like in the hands of a beginner. Not even Hawkins and Bryant help this one out. Another Prestige from the late 50""s that should have been left in the Fantasy vault. While alive Tiny should have listened to one of the new guitarists at his time that he liked Johnny Smith whose recordings at about the same time put this one to shame. If you like guitar in the hands of a master, get his Moonlight in Vermont cd and skip good old Tiny."
4,Good for daily prayer,"this little book is great for a quick, quiet prayer, based on the 12 Step programCan be used as part of a prayer routine or just picked up anytime for a reminder of our Higher Power."
1,Tedious Autobiography,This is a turgid tome written in the most indulgent style by the author. Marguerite Steinheil was a fascinating woman with the most extraordinary life as a courtesan in the Belle Epoche who was involved in the death of the President of France and her own mother and husband. Read about it elsewhere.
2,NOT WORTH A LOT OF MONEY!,I HAVE A COPY OF THIS BOOK. IT IS FULL OF INTERESTING INFORMATION ABOUT CANCER BUT REALLY HARD TO FOLLOW IN SOME WAYS. CERTAINLY NOT WORTH A LOT OF MONEY FOR A SOFT COVER BOOK WITH LAST THAN 250 PAGES. A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK CAN BE FOUND ONLINE. WHAT A BIG SAVINGS THAT IS!
3,"Decent effort, but . . . skip this, read the Amber books!","A decent book, but...Stross, stick to the hard Sci-Fi! Readers, skip this and read (or re-read, as the case may be) the Amber Chronicles! And did I read some review somewhere that stated this was a great ""update"" of the Amber tale? Gimme a break! Might as well say we need to update Moby Dick or Hamlet! Amber don't need no stinkin' update! The late Roger Zelazny not only did it first, but did it much, much better! On a trivia note, I give Stross kudos for what I think was an homage to Neuromancer. The first line of this book reads very much like an updated version of the first line of that seminal Gibson cyberpunk novel! I give you a nod for that, but it don't change the review, old bean! Long live Amber!"
1,Too close to what he hates,"One of the enjoyments I have of reading fantasy is that you often get a view that is different from yours. That certainly happens here in an unattractive manner. What I don't accept is zealots -- left or right. This author is extreme in that. Put him on one side of the teeter-totter and the worst Neocon on the other and they will balance it perfectly.He doesn't even bother to hide some names. It is a biased portrait of the worst of Dubya's gang. Lord know, there is little need for such exaggeration. It carries it to the point that you want to see Stross water-boarded.The writing starts out well. The premise is interesting. Then, like so many overreaching series, it falls apart. The writing deteriorated. Unfortunate when one's emotion trumps all. Zealotry results. Sad! Very sad."
4,Entertaining but....(needs research),"I usually enjoy parallel universe stories and this one is no exception. Would continue reading the series.One caveat, why o why don't authors who are going to have weapons figure predominantly in their books do at least a minimum amount of research about them? It's soooo(!) aggravating to be jarred out of the story by stupid (preventable) mistakes. A snub-nosed revolver with a safety catch? An elite military unit carrying MAC-10's?This skinny (by modern standards) book is a pretty good teaser though. I'll keep reading and hope the author reads the reviews and does some research."
2,"Promising start, but next books get worse and worse","Good idea, but stereotypical characters, and way too much repitition of themes in the following books. There are much better series to start reading. Throughout the book I was intrigued but nothing lives up to its potential."
5,Time Trax,We have thought we could find this series and now we are wondering how we can get the second season.
5,Time Trax,"I saw this series long time ago in TV and loved it. as soon as I saw I it, I got it. I recommend it for the nostalgia felling it brings. Relaxing series with a clean view. PG as for me and my kids. No sex, very little violence or none on most of them. A must have series"
1,What a useless book!!!!,"I found this book to be totally useless. I just tells you how to go to a dive shop and get certified. There is almost no useful instruction in the whole book. Just go get certified and you can skip the book. I expected info on using the dive tables or other specific info, however, I found it completely lacking anything you don't get in a basic open water class. I guess if you want to be told the kind of things you will learn in a dive class go ahead. This book does not compare with the other books in the ""Dummies"" Series. Don't waste your money."
1,limited knowledge and over simplification of scuba diving,This book is oversimplified and leaves out important details dive students need to know in order to fully enjoy scuba diving while maximizing safety. This is just a hype book to sell the training agency who sponsored it and their poorly structured courses. Many superior books on this site. Save your money on this one.
4,National Geographic crossed with Pure Evil,"Reading this excellent book, I was swept by the wordly grandeur of exotic (though corrupt and crude) Calcutta, India; and I was swept by the horror and mystery of pure evil as well.This book reads like a real-life story of a professional man who travels to a far away land and encounters the truly evil. The writing is top-notch and conjures up pictures quite deftly. This is a great horror novel. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat and you won't be able to put it down."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the Hyperion and Iluim novels, I approached Kali with high expectations and was frankly disappointed. Maybe I'm jaded by images of human sacrifice, but reading Kali was like reading the novelization of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" minus the comedy."
4,Brilliant writing...Harrowing Tale,"Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer. I don't think anybody will deny that after reading his works...especially Song of Kali. He takes you to a dark, dark place and doesn't let you go. You feel like gasping for breath but you can't. His writing does that to you. I've never read anything like this in horror. I'm not surprised it won the World Fantasy Award. He creates a horrific world where menacing things lurk at every corner. This is what horror should do and he does it very nicely. If you want to read another horror masterpiece by Simmons, you should check out Summer of Night. Its better in my opinion. But this is still an unforgettable experience. Simmons has the gift."
1,The worst book I've ever read!,Where can I begin to descibe how awful this book was? How about that they murder the main characters baby in Calcutta to smuggle jewels in it Or that the author goes into an agonizing long description of stealing a bloated foul smelling corpse that was a drowning death. Or The long drawn out tale about a Hindu Goddess named Kali who wants human blood as an offering. Yuck!! That is the best way to descibe this book.
5,start your Ellington collection with this!,"between the too-skimpy single disc best ofs..and back and bank breaking box sets..sits this new offering and a treat it is! covering most of Dukes career and presenting greatest hits a plenty it seems perverse that someone would not LOVE this collection. You can review the 65 tracks for yourself so I won't bother to list them..suffice it to say they have never sounded better....unless you were lucky enough to see this group LIVE..This gets top ratings for Content, Packaging and Sound Quality..an absolute MUST have for any serious collector of music from the Last Century.."
5,This is a GREAT album!,"I had these albums way back when, and then was lucky enough to find this rare cd for sale a year or so ago. I can't wait for the individual cd's to come out, as this Best Of only has 4-5 tracks from each album.That said, it is an excellent collection, really represents the best of Cowboy.This band was SO under-rated, it is ridiculous. Even most late 60's, early '70's afficianados have never heard of them! But they wrote great songs, played great, and this is one of my favorite albums!If they ever come out with the individual albums, please be sure to buy the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ones, at least.It is apparently now out of print, but sometimes you can find it at amazon used or half.com."
4,"Good product, Small bag","You think ""2 pounds, Wow! That's a lot!"" It really isn't. Next time I will buy two bags!. You could probably stuff a large amount in two medium sized toys or several small toys."
5,Patty McCormack: Is Fabulous,"This is truly a great movie,I was blown away by Patty McCormack's performance.I really enjoy watching old movies,I seem to prefer these type of movies over the ones of this era.So I give this movie a 5 star rating.Thank you Amazon for your fast and wonderful service,I enjoy purchasing my dvds and cds from you I will be purchasing items from you again real soon."
4,Good But Not Perfect,"At the beginning of the tape, there is a blank screen for a couple of seconds...I contacted the seller, but they never responded back...Overall, it is a good tape"
5,Very old movie,A very old but classic movie. Fun to watch after so many years. Still is as scary as it was 40 years ago.
5,"""Well, I'll Be A Middle-Aged Mongoloid From Memphis!""...","THE BAD SEED is all about Patty Mccormack's iconic role as conscience-free, homicidal child, Rhoda Penmark. She is mesmerizing! Her cold personality frosts the screen. After perfecting the character in the stageplay, Mccormack wears Rhoda like a second skin. Her ruthless, lethal persona lays waste to her fellow cast-members. If you enjoy eeevil kid movies, then this is the beginning of them all! Patty would grow up to play some wonderfully wicked adults, as in her roles in MOMMY, MOMMY 2: MOMMY'S DAY, and SHALLOW GROUND..."
5,bad seed,"[[ASIN:B001TGXNXU The Bad Seed Actual description was right on the money. priced was very good, well packaged and I seen the movie long ago and that's why I wanted the dvd, because it's a movie you can watch over."
3,A great performance,"This was never a great stage production or film, but it has one outstanding thing to recommend it: the performance of the late Eileen Heckart, one of America's great actresses. There are not many of Heckhart's performances that are permanent, so her fans will relish this one."
2,melodrama to whip up fear of genetic determinism,"This is a crude plug for genetic determinism of a sociopathic child murderer. While some of the details of the plot are frightening - a child committing savage acts for the most mundane of motives - the one-sided assumption that it is purely because of ""bad genes"" ruined the experience for me. Sure, I admit my bias for a combination of genetic temperament with environment to explain who we become, so my revulsion is personal. I just think viewers should know about the film's message,"
2,Didn't work on my kindle fire,This is one of my favorite movies to watch with my mom but unfortunately it was very choppy and did not work well on my kindle fire. Amazon refunded me for my purchase though so that's good!
5,Chilling,"I've seen this movie many times and how such a lovely little girl could be so nasty is amazing. The acting is wonderful to say the least.My only advice to other reviewers: Please, please don't tell too much and give the whole plot away. No one will want to see these movies. Movies like this one are real classics!"
5,Kids are evil too!,"This is such a cool movie. I first saw it on AMC or some other cable channel about 15 years ago. It was one of those things you flip on for a minute because it sounds interesting and end up watching the whole thing. I've seen it several times since then, and recommended it to many people. I am a big fan of horror movies, and psychological/suspense movies. And this is one of the best. Not gory in any way, but creepy to the max. The original ""evil child who looks angelic"" movie. A must-have for any serious movie collector."
5,When Good Seeds Go Bad :),"Great performances by entire cast & so much talent! I am always on the lookout for black & white suspense mystery type movies, and this one is extraordinarily chilling in its realistic ventures. Disturbing to the point of fascination, though it was, the thrill factor was there from beginning to end. Five stars!!!"
5,Best Song Ever.,"""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" Is the best ballad I have ever heard. This song has to be one of the most beautiful ballads ever recorded simpley because of the perfect singing of robin and barry together. Stunning guitar solos, but with a distant sound adding mystery.Get this cd just for that song. The other songs are pretty decent as well."
5,Very Good,"I believe this is a very good album. I love the sounds in the songs that the brothers write. Especially ""Paying The Price Of Love"" and ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"". But, I also liked the smooth flowing song, ""Haunted House"". But still, each song has its good points. The album contains nice, happy songs and slow moving songs. Lets just say, I think it has a song for whatever mood a listener is in."
5,Good stuff,"These guys are legit. Bold about their faith, yet creative and honest with their music and lyrics. They are now known as I Am Terrified. Go out and support these guys in whatever ways you can."
1,Financial Accounting,"I still can not get it... and I don't need it anymore, but I still have to pay money..... What's goin on my book????????"
4,Excellent for bowl-tipping and bowl-dragging cats,"We bought this at our local Petco, it is the same item, made by the same company, currently selling for the same price. It's the only thing that's worked, so far, for our inveterate bowl-tipping- and- dragging cat. I was so tired of walking thru a puddle of water or tripping over the bowl she'd drag halfway across the kitchen floor almost on a daily basis.WE TRIED OTHER THINGS:heavier, weighted bowls for dogs, so-called no-tip and no- drag bowls that were stainless steel with rubber rings on the bottom, bowls in metal racks/holders, etc. Nothing worked.This has worked, for us, and will also let us load them up and do short weekend getaways and not worry she'll be out of water or food due to spills, as before.The only negative is, for me, that the items are made of lightweight plastic and are expensive for what they are made of and what they do. Five bucks less and I may not have minded..."
5,"a masterpiece of life, a 10 plus!!","every once in a while a movie will come out and speak of life...like this unforgettable motion picture does. clint eastwood in his greatest performance ever will win the academy award. morgan freeman and hilary swank who you will fall in love with, give wonderful examples of love, sadness,and achievment in life. this is one the greatest motion pictures ever made. this compares to stunning movies like "" life is beautiful "" "" sling blade "" and "" the strait story "" these are the trails and stories in life that really mean something, and not all this useless junk that comes out from hollywood these days. everyone should see this beautiful movie and remind us of what life and love and sacrifice is all about and be oh so grateful for our familes and our country in which we live. A TRULY MAGNIFICENT MOTION PICTURE."
5,Great Story!!!,"Yes!!! Amother great sports story!! A story that makes you fall in love with the characters..especially Maggie Fitzgerald!!Million Dollar Baby tells of a 30- something woman who wants to prove to the world, and herself that she can become something. Coming from a family life of despair and heartache, she finds love in the sport of boxing. The only problem is, with her being a woman, she finds it hard to find someone who will take her on and teach her the sport, and take her seriously. Enter Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn) Dunn refuses to coach/ manage Fitzgerald, but after watching her for sometime, sees something in her that he only sees in certain people...desire!Excellent storyline, great characterization on all fronts. A story that really makes you care for those in the picture. If you are into sporting events, such as boxing, even if you are not, this is a movie that will have you laughing and crying at the same time. Does not miss this Academy Award Winning Movie!!!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"For me, this was sort of a waste of 2 hours. Some of the things were predictable, but I wasn't sure how it was all going to play out. I just couldn't connect with the characters all that much. I have really tried to like Hilary Swank as an actress, but for some reason I just haven't found her in a role that seems to capture an emotional captivating role.Clint Eastwood is always great, and so is Morgan Freeman they were great in this film. This was a touching story, but I feel it could have been more gripping for me with a different leading female, or some background music, I don't really recall any, and I just watched it last night.There are many positive reviews, and to many this probably was a good film, I just didn't feel it.At least I just had it as a rental from Net-Flix."
2,Million Dollar boo-boo,"I like Clint Eastwood and his movies for the most part. However, this multiple-Oscar winning film was very disappointing.I went into it not knowing anything about it except what was obvious from the DVD cover (female boxer) and the Oscar buzz...So, Clint brings the same gravelly voice he used in 1986's ""Heartbreak Ridge"", Hilary Swank brings an irritating drawl as well as an irritating character personality, and Morgan Freeman tags along and they all win Oscars.Not only was the movie a big downer, which normally is OK - they don't all have to be Disneyesque - but along the way I felt manipulated through some of it as it went off on tangents.Worst of all, I think, is the rather sudden development of an over-aged waitress into some type of boxing phenom - when we all know it really takes a lot more hard work, dedication, training, and luck to have that kind of success.Still, it was a well-made professional movie, and some people rate it a knock-out. I'm throwing in the towel."
1,dosent work,gave this too a friend because didnt work for my type of player and it wouldnt work for my friend he said he couldnt even get it started would like refund
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Best picture? Really? Against The Ropes had more flavor than this. I can't even tell if this is supposed to be set in present day or like 30+ years ago, or if that ambiguity is intentional. The old trainer dude makes some arbitrary statements about ""pride"" and ""heart"" intended to pass for wisdom, and the way the other boxers in the gym behave makes it seem like a prison for the mentally disabled. Swank's character's manner of speaking like Huck Finn makes her seem at home in the asylum atmosphere, but there is no exploration of her progression as a fighter, it's just like one minute the trainer says she knows nothing and then suddenly she's convincingly winning all her fights. And what is the title supposed to mean?"
3,HOW DID IT WIN,"One of the things I will never understand is how this film won Best Picture and Best Actress. I love Clint and Hilary, but this film was boring and nothing special. It wasn't aweful, but in reality it shouldn't have even been nominated. It was, once again, dark and I fell asleep twice. Hilary Swank won the Oscar, once again stealing it from Annete Benning who deserved it. Swank just put on a bad accent and it was not a great performance. The Aviator sshould have won ultimately but it didn't. I was dissapointed"
2,"Same Hollywood crap, but at least it wasn't a remake","Terrible. Predictable. And when did Dirty Harry become a boxing trainer? I mean come on Clint. If you can't act, your the director, find someone who can.I saw this movie the first time when it was called Rocky. Seriously. The only thing that separated this from Rocky was the lack of a cheesey montage.Definately shouldn't have won all of the awards it did. I saw many better movies this year."
1,"Boring, Overrated, etc....YAWN!!","I was very disappointed after struggling through this so called ""Masterpiece"". The movie was too darn long and I got tired of looking at Hilary Swank's buck teeth. I really thought this was going to be a good movie because I enjoy boxing movies and after seeing Cinderella Man I thought this would be just as good. But I was wrong and ended up falling asleep probably two different times through it.I had to read the DVD box a couple of times to assure myself that Clint Eastwood directed it because it reminded me of an Oliver Stone movie - the type that overkills a theme/message.I guess I'm in the minority when saying that I just don't see why it got such great praise.If Amazon.com let me I would give this a Zero Star Rating.Clint, stick with Dirty Harry and Unforgiven type movies."
4,Million Dollar Movie - I under paid at the box office,"Wow. Every now and then a movie comes a long that moves you so profoundly you're inspired to become a better person... to work just a little harder, to complain just a little bit less, to appreciate what you already have just a little bit more.This is one of them. It will certainly be added to my collection and watched when ever I'm feeling sorry for myself.Hatts off to Hillary, Morgan, and Clint. Stunning performances by all three. Bravo all around!"
2,i dont get it...,"...as in, i dont like it; before this one, every movie from eastwood seems to me, not only well made, but great and sofisticated, i really like what this guy is able to make, but in this case the story seems to much to tell just a few things, and (probably is just me) the all movie seems to be about nothing, a not very new story, with nothing new to tell, in a very old way... anyway, the thing is still better than most releases, but i feel it felt short considering all it had going for it"
1,Incredibly Depressing,"We had high hopes going into this movie, as Clint Eastwood has proven himself to be a great director. BUT...This movie is the downer of the year. We were left with the feeling that if we had buried ourselves in rocks and mud, we would have felt better than having watched this extemely depressing flick."
2,Women should not box period,"I didn't feel that the film connected on an emotional level, and that it was more like watching stock characters in action. Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I'm a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated. The second half drags considerably, and I felt the whole third act to be very manipulative."
4,"Very moving, not what I expected","I picked this movie up at the video store several times but always put it back because, well, I loathe boxing. I had the chance to see it for free so I took it, figuring there must be something beyond the whole boxing thing to have made this such an acclaimed movie. You can read all the other reviews to get the jist of the overall story line, I won't waste time or space doing that for the hundredth time. I will tell you that this movie probably isn't anything like what you are expecting. Even as much as I hate violence, Maggie won my heart and I was rooting for her during each boxing match, right up to the heartbreaking end. This film is a testament to fate and the power of our choices and determination. Although I don't want to see this movie again and won't be recommending it to anyone, it's one I definitely won't forget for a long time."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!,"I recieved this film in a timely fashion but it was NOT the WIDESCREEN EDITION as advertised and pictured here on Amazon. I ended up with the modified fullscreen version, which defeats the purpose of watching it on my new flatscreen T.V. I'm Not happy, and probably wont order anything from anyone other than Amazon directly from now on."
3,Horrible ending,"This DVD featured a good story and very good acting. The generous use of four-letter words did nothing to advance the plot or the quality of the story. The ending was tragic and depressing, causing me to dispose of the DVD. I did not want to keep it in my collection. Clint Eastwood has made some great movies, but I never want to see this one again."
5,"Multi-Layered, Spare, Beautiful","Million Dollar Baby seems like a simple story on the surface. It is told sparely, without ruffles or flourishes, but like all great art, has layers of meaning and symbolism.On the surface (and what a vivid surface!) there is the boxing, and Maggie's indomitable spirit, which all her life has helped her fight to survive.There are the relationships, laconic but deep, like slow-flowing rivers; the bones on which the surface lies.And at the movie's heart: there is religious significance. The story becomes one of Christ's parables of the Good Samaritan or the Kingdom of Heaven. And there is a Christ figure. But who is the Christ figure and how can that person save others?It is interesting that some conservative groups find this movie offensive. If they consider it anti-family or anti-religious, they are really missing the point."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Marred only by an unfortunate subplot involving a mentally-deficient boxer, Million Dollar Baby is a powerful look at three characters that pulls no punches and takes its story to an emotionally honest conclusion; a deserved Oscar-winner, it is well worth a watch."
4,The Cutting Edge,"A very temperamental Kate Mosley has dreams of being a skating champion who has scared off many potential partners. Douglas Dorsey has dreams of being a professional hockey player. When an unfortunate accident impairs his vision, and he is no longer able to compete at the professional level, his dream is altered forever. Doug and Kate are paired together toward a new dream.This is a charming romantic movie. DB Sweeney and Moira Kelly have good on screen chemistry, and the skating is well done."
3,Not for kids,"I was disappointed. I was hoping for a family movie, but this isn't one. The movie opens with a couple in bed. The guy can't remember the girl's name.Recommended romantic comedy: I.Q."
2,is this a DVD?,"It amazes me everyone gave this such a good review, now it is a great movie, but the DVD stinksThe quality of the DVD itself id less than VCD quality, I mean Id rather have gotten the VHS, its terrible.It looks like the director went to theatures and sat in with a sony handycam and recorded the DVD with that.As for the movie itself, the movie is great, but the ending was lacking in that they can suddenl do the hardest move ever done and yet in practice it was never even close to being completed, i mean not even close. Maybe they just didnt want the movie to be way too long, but come on, give the audiance some credit here.If this had been the review for the VHS maybe I would have been kinder, but the low low qualit of the DVD just killed the movie."
3,The Cutting Edge,"As expected, an old plot, a very old plot, done with new technology, new faces and in color. Like an ice cream sundae, always good for a few minutes of relaxation, with no lingering negative after effects."
4,Good Modern Version of the Taming of the Shrew,"Ok, this is not Shakespeare, but It's an enjoyable flick nonetheless. The chemistry between the two main characters is palpable and realistic and I actually enjoyed it more than ""Sleepless in Seattle"" for example, since the attraction between the two leads is not built on improbable new-age-like twists of fate, but on the realistic fact that the girls actually finds a guy who relentlessly tames her. All in all, it's a pretty good date movie that will satisfy both genders."
3,should have stayed in the fridge,"I really like Ozric Tentacles, but this video left me cold. The songs ramble on with no real direction, everyones really high and doing their own thing (John's incoherent)and there is just no cohesion at all. The production and sound are poor, the ""special"" effects are annoying and the songlist isn't really their best stuff. They do pull together slightly for Erpland but the rest is not real good. There are better Ozric Tentacles videos out there if you look hard enough, but the best thing is to see them live in person, its a show you're not likely to forget. If you have seen them live you'll probably not like this one, I didn't."
5,Good.,This product was sold at a reasonable price. The product is true to its description. I would recommend this product to others.
5,Great saw,This is the best drywall saw there is! Supersharp! A blade cover would help to protect it. I would highly recommended for any drywall work.
4,"New York City like it was: unrecognizable, yet still larger than life","'Manhattan Transfer' is certainly a curious read. It contains dozens of interwoven threads of people living in New York during World War I. Many of these threads are utterly forgettable, some are quite interesting. What makes 'Manhattan Transfer' so interesting is the narrative (..Dos Passos really captures the vernacular of locals) and the historical perspective; New York of 1918 is much different than it is today. So while certainly not for everyone, 'Manhattan Transfer' is a worthy diversion for those tired of fiction found on supermarket shelves.Bottom line: less ambitious than his more famous 'USA Trilogy', Dos Passos is in fine form with his earlier work 'Manhattan Transfer'. Recommended."
5,Nicholson's Most Epic Performance - A True Masterpiece,"I just watched this film for the first time on DVD, and it is even more awe inspiring than I remembered. What an all star cast ! Brad Dourif (aka Grima Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings) shines as Billy Bibbett, the sweet but stuttering young inmate, along with early appearances by Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito.But make no mistake - this is Jack's film all the way. You can absolutely feel his experience in the asylum, along with the growing tension that escalates into the final confrontation and devastating climax. This movie earned the Oscar for best picture 1975, and Oscars for Nicholson and Louise Fletcher as well. it actually deserves way more than the 5 stars given here !"
5,Psych Student,I am a psych student and had to watch this movie for a class. I love old movies and this was a great depiction of mental health.
4,i read the book first,"the book was much better, so it was hard to watch it. other than that it is an awesome movie."
2,Won't hold a charge or it is defective - read the last paragraph!,"The purpose I purchased this battery was to be ready to replace the old one. The charge life was becoming low and I knew it was a matter of time before I would need a replacement.Just within the last few days, the inevitable happened and I was ready with the ""new"" battery. I was aware it would need to be recharged before use and let it charge for about two days as I didn't need to use my camera. When I did use it, it barely held the charge long enough to snap a few photos before the warning light appeared.Thinking it was new and might need a ""breaking-in"" period, I recharged it again for a few days and received the same result. I believe it is either defective or too old, but I have no way to tell for sure which it is. It may be both.I have always had good luck with Fuji, so I am giving them a little slide on rating this product for that reason alone."
5,Invaluable,It's very difficult to describe how valuable this video set is for teachers and parents. I teach Early Childhood Education classes to high school students who may want to become teachers. I have developed an understanding of the early stages of my own children and have been able to pass on a depth of understanding of young children's development that is unparalleled...simply by showing this well planned and scripted series. I only wish there was a sequel!Kathy Keene
1,Terrible picture quality,"I've been stupid enough to purchase this dvd from two different companies. The first version I purchased was produced by Passport Video. The movie had the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a dvd, including blurry images, video drop outs, and poor sound. The dvd looked as though it was a transfer from a fourth generation vhs copy. Then I saw that Diamond Entertainment was selling a version which they advertised as ""Fully restored and enhanced digital master"". Total nonsense. The video is just as bad as the dvd produced by Passport Video. I'm just going to wait and hope that this great little film shows up on television in high definition, and record it onto dvd for my personal viewing pleasure."
3,JACK COLVIN...Oscar Moment????,"The scene with Rock Hudson in which Jack Colvin (playing Dr. Winston)was torn between medical ethics and mere trust in a dear friend is the pivotal moment in this film. The excruciating agony in which Dr. Winston is debating in his subconscious is no doubt evident in this accomplished actors face. Dr. Winston makes no promise at that time but we can tell that an internal battle will be raging within him until his final decision can be made. Later Dr. Winston, in full operating gear, calls Rock to inform him that he's got what Rock's looking for. Fatigue and uncertainty is worn well on the actors face, for the result( as later we learn) could be disastrous.Jack Colvin, the greatest character actor of the 20th and possibly the 21st century hits another homerun in this ""pre-Jack Mcgee"" performance. I believe before Rock Hudson passed on he was quoted as saying, ""One of the greatest accomplishments of my life was working with the legendary Jack Colvin."""
3,Anthony Gonzalez needs Boom Bip,"This CD is almost there. I can tell what Anthony is trying to say, what feelings he's trying to convey, but it just seems to fall a little short in translation. Sadly, this makes for a CD that is only pretty good. It brings up my hopes, waiting for an incredible emotional frenzy, but never actually comes to fruition. So what does all this have to do with Boom Bip? Well, he released a remix of ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" that, with it's more driving electronic sound, pushed the song through that elusive barrier. The changes are subtle but they sure did the trick for me. Anthony, you're that close!"
1,won't run,"this was released during the now infamous ""starf**k"" (starforce) pc breaking rootkit installing copy protection fiasco. Windows won't allow it to run. I tried with steam thinking they would've removed the stupid pc breaking crap first but no, it still won't run. A leading female developer did this and I was very anxious to get a look at it. I imagine it's dismal failure was due to exactly the thing that was meant to protect the revenue stream - idiotic copy protection. Look idiots - you should know by now that criminals will always find a way. Copy protection only hurts the paying customer."
3,Pretty good,"This seems to be a fairly playable and enjoyable game...especially for the price. It took a while to load on my computer...and the loading times are still bad, but aside from that it seems a pretty good ""run around and kill stuff game"". So far I haven't experienced any of the problems mentioned by some of the other reviewers.... The camera is a little bothersome, and you need to become comfortable with the map and directional movement, still, could be a lot worse.So, this isn't a ""new"" game by any means, but it still seems pretty good for Diablo fans looking for another clone."
4,"not bad, wish creatures didn't regenerate constantly","Good fun, but the save game feature is poorly implemented, forcing you to start again in the nearest town with all the same bad guys to fight all over again to get to the target of your current quest. I'd much prefer the traditional true save and death is really death model. Too much effort to appeal to the game system crowd these days, I guess. The performance of this game for loading is also abysmal, likely another side effect of writing it for game systems instead of a real computer. Still, not a bad effort."
3,BB Holster,It's a good produc for the price ... I saw it at a local electronics store for almost 10 times I got it here ... if you're looking for something to carry you presious BB around this is one of the best.
5,Raffi,Raffi's songs are great easy to learn and lots of action just the way we like songs. CD was in great shape
5,"Excellent Children's Music, First Song to Last","This is a wonderful collection of children's music. I use this CD with children in the first grade. We sing and have fun. The songs have a great melody. All the songs are wonderful.What's even more important is that the messages are appropriate and good for children. I tried to talk our music teacher into singing ""Like Me and You"" for our school program, but I had no luck. I think it's a very special song for children, and Raffi is very special. Maybe next year.Like Me and YouBy Raffi""Janet lives in EnglandPierre lives in FranceBonnie lives in Canada""Ahmed lives in EgyptMoshe lives in IsraelBruce lives in Australia""Ching lives in ChinaOlga lives in RussiaIngrid lives in Germany""Gita lives in IndiaPablo lives in SpainJose lives in Columbia""And each one is much like anotherA child of a mother and a fatherA very special son or daughterA lot like me and you..."""
4,Tom's Hands have wings.,Tom Grant's Hands is a nice collection of melodies from this gifted musician. He has the ability to set a nice mood with his style and variety of tunes.
2,unfit for publishing,"Sigh... I saw this at the bookstore and had to open it up. How could people write a book this fast I ask myself... The answer is, they didn't, they simply photocopied the President's records. I served in the military active duty, I know what the documentation entails, and it showed nothing haneous at all. Most people who believe this are the same ones who buy into Moore's fuzzy logic and have never served in the military to understand the mounds of useless paperwork one signs and then throws away to leave room for skivies and skeedunk in your seabag. I got out two years ago and couldn't come up with half my records if I tried. If this book is in retribution to the swift boat book, it is like Al-Qa'idah trying to ""one-up"" us by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs while tormenting us with random acts of Noogies and Atomic Wedgies. pathetic. I'll give it two stars because I feel bad for em and they'll probably need it."
1,"""Hot-Air"" Smith","Objectively read the records and the facts show a person with a high level of achievement: a degree from Yale and several years of military service, often with exceptional marks. The writer shows a lot of bias."
4,Nice Afternoon Read,"`The sexiest dead man alive' by Jane Blackwood has a mix of romance, hot tempers and grieving parents. Declan has been hiding out in his fortress for two years and then hires Rose to be his personal chef. Rose was hired for the job without ever meeting her new boss but has the `hots' for him by just his voice. The secondary story of parents dealing with their little daughter's death was heartbreaking. This was pleasant afternoon read. I would recommend this novel and A Hard Man Is Good To Find by Jane Blackwood."
5,Loved it,"I picked this book up at my church book fair for 25 cents, not having a clue what it was about. I didn't even read the back cover. I ended up absolutely loving this book. I could not put it down. I thought the story line was original and engaging, and you really felt the romance between Declon and Rose. The beginning was suspenseful trying to figure out who the mystery man was. You just really wanted things to work out with them throughout the whole book. I found myself thinking about the characters for days after I finished reading. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great romance novel."
5,Definitive collection,"I couldn't believe how good this looked. The look and sound of perfect indeed. Can you believe this movie is 25 years old? Granted the dated computers look strange to us now, but the detail this version contains is incredible.I also like that there are two versions for those that want just the movies or those that want it all.WB hit a home run with this. I hope they give this treatment to all of their major catalog titles going forward."
1,Why did they do it???,In short I loved this film and when I first saw it back in 1982 and it took several times to really get the fullness of the movie....but now they have cut the heart out of the feelings of the film by removing Harrison Ford's narrative__the thing that I loved most about the movie. I was VERY disappointed when I saw the DVD the first time and haven't watched it since....DON't get it wait for the real version to released in 2001.
3,Release the Original for God's Sake,Blade Runner is one of the finest sci-fi films ever released in it's 1982 form. The Director's cut is a poor second to the original I have the original now on laserdisc which is the only way to go until Ridley changes his mind.
5,Let's Cut To The Chase,"And the winner is: Disc 1 The Final CutI have seen all the versions, and this one is the most powerful.If you've never seen this film, watch The Final Cut first. You will be glad you did.And not enough can be said about the haunting beauty of Sean Young in her prime. You end up wishing she was in every scene."
1,A great film draged thorugh the mud!,"Blade Runner one of the greatist sci-fi movies ever made has been disgraced! don't get me wrong, I love the official version. It kicked major.....you know what. But the director's cut needs to get its you know what kicked by the official version. Here are the reasons you should see the offical version instead of the director's cut (spoilers ahead):1.They made Deckerd a replicant in this version. Now you don't have anyone to cheer for. 2.They cut the happy ending. I mean come on...Ridley Scott thought that was a good thing? 3. The voice-overs gave the film a great Maltese Falcon feel. Are thay in the directors cut? NO! So there you have it. Go see the version that's good. And, yes, I am a 12 year old that has seen Blade Runner."
2,Something has been lost since I first saw this movie,"I heard the ""suits"" at Warner made Scott add the voice over because they thought the movie's plot was too vague without it, looks like they were right. But this movie has other weaknesses. First the FX which set the mood has lost much of its power to impress, granted that can't be helped, but its still a fact. The not so subtle Japan bashing, from a time when Japan was seen as our #1 threat, seems as corny today as a Red Scare movie from the `50s. Last the endless philosophizing by beings, that don't exist, and probably never will, on the subject of ""are skin jobs human"". Maybe expecting a movie to have the same impact 25 years later is unrealistic, or maybe it was based on once trendy now passé ideas."
3,Blade Runner Review,"Blade Runner is an excellent movie which I've owned on DVD for many years. Acquiring the Blu Ray version is what I do with the top tier movies in my collection. I have great respect for the conversion of this movie to Blu Ray. However, I was disappointed at the ending. This movie is known to have several endings. I felt that, with Blu Ray, all of these endings should have been available. It is for this reason that I only gave it 3 stars.The music for Blade Runner was even more enchanting than I remembered."
4,I vote for happy endings and clarity.,"I own both versions. I originally saw this at a drivein as the second feature that we didn't intend to see at all, but it sucked us in before we had a chance to pack up and go.The way that Ford did the narration worked for me and I was glad he got what he needed in the ending of the original.This is still a dark semi-depressing movie and you have to watch it in darkness to fully apprciate the environment created. The director cut removes some humanity from the film so I like it less than the original. Perfect would be adding the extra stuff, keeping the narration and the original ending."
3,Movie deserves better dvd treatment,"This film has a vision of where we may be headed, pollution, crowding, melding of languages and cultures. Still large corporations wield an enormous amount of power. The focus though is on the characters and what it means to have a shortened life and always live in fear of being hunted. Besides the characters the mood and bleak futuristic world are the stars. As much as I like the film I was hoping for more extras, especially with several discs. 5 stars for the film, 2 stars for the dvd version."
4,Great Classic,"A classic movie. Some of the technology looks a bit ""aged"" at this point but the plot still works and the dark photography is still chilling."
5,"Excellent movie , perfect quality","The movie itself is ofcourse a classic. And I just wanted this one in full HD format, but what suprised me is that you get sucked into the movie even more with all that detail. It just lookes stunning... even now after al those years."
3,Liked it.,This is a classic. It does not need to be rated. I didn't give it five stars because the voice-over by Ford was missing.
2,How do you get the closed captioning to work?,"Closed captioning not available...bummer! Luckily, I still have an older DVD which does have closed captioning. This purchase was a waste of money!"
1,I would give it zero stars if i could.,"Unbelievably terrible movie, and a terrible transfer. I'd go into more detail, but that would require that i think about the movie again, and i refuse to make myself do that."
1,Terrible Director's Cut,"The original version was a great ""film noir."" Like so many ""Director's Cut"" versions, this was a pointless waste of time and money."
2,BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL,I don't like the Director's Cut. Anyone know if I can get the REAL movie? helen@ewm.com The narration MADE the movie!
2,Some things are best left untouched,This is or was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Until the directors cut was released. This show is an empty shell without the Fords narrative. I only gave it two stars but I would give the original 6.
3,"Classic sci-fi, bad dvd","2002 marks the 20th anniversary of this landmark film's release, and I echo the previous reviews' sentiment about the need for a definitive dvd version - preferrably with commentary by both the director and the stars, Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer. The plot I'm sure you know by now after some five hundred reviews ...I won't repeat it. As far as the director's cut, by and large it's an improvement (doing away with the original voice-over) on the theatrical release version, with the exception of the somewhat incongruous unicorn dream sequence. The real star of the movie remains, for me, after twenty years and many repeat viewings, the jaw-dropping set design of a futuristic Los Angeles. An indisputable all-time sci-fi classic."
4,Directors Cut falls from height of original,"The Directors Cut without the voice-overs of the original movie does not provide the morality play characteristics of original. I have watched the original movie about 20 times and have been fascinated with the deepth of emotion that it brings to the screen with so little in the way of dialogue, but without the voice-overs much of this is lost. I watched the directors cut once and enjoyed the scenery but not much more. Amazon should find some copies of the original to sell."
2,No voice-overs makes Blade Runner turn Slient,"The DC of Blade Runner lacks the seedy 1940's PI tone that was set with Ford's voice overs. While the extra scenes developed the charcters more, the whole tone of the movie was silenced. Ford's voice-overs made the the movie for me, and without them, the moive is long, and just another sci-fi film."
4,Great Movie.....but.........,The ending in this version of the film isn't as appealing as other versions I have viewed. Although the outcome is essentially the same.....IMO.
5,My discs were the correct ones,"I finally got around to replacing my HD DVD version with the Blu Ray. All the discs were there, including Disc 1. Interesting differences between the HD DVD and BD editions: The pop-up menus don't slide up and make that annoying ""woosh"" sound in the BD edition- they just appear with no sound. Secondly, you don't have the ability to use bookmarks in the BD version. And lastly, on the HD DVD edition if you paused the movie a little timeline would appear showing you were you are in the movie, that feature is not in the BD version.These differences are, in my opinion, minor quibbles in what is one of the greatest home video releases of all time. This belongs on the shelf of any movie lover. A classic."
1,"My rating is not about the movey, it is about Amazon","I am and American teaching college in Vietnam. I first tried to order this product on my Kindle. I was unable to do this. So I ordered it through Amazon on my laptop. I succeeded in ordering it, but could not transfer it to my Kindle. So I tried to watch it on my laptop. It was impossible to watch. It timed out, and if I paused it, it started again from the beginning. After an hour without success, I gave up.Fortunately, Amazon eventually refunded my fee."
3,DVD not worth it until they put everything on one disc!,"Don't bother buying this DVD, especially if you already have the VHS version.Don't give the studios money to put out garbage content and charge exorbitant rates for it.I'll buy the DVD when everything is on the one disc... documentaries, both cuts, missing scenes like the hospital scene, even if it is in mono, and for good measure I'd like to see text matter like original movie reviews.Now THAT's worth paying extra money for!"
3,Not as good as I remember.,I remember seeing this movie when I was a senior in high school. I thought it was pretty good at the time.Looks dated and weird now. I didn't enjoy it. Does not hold up well over time. Not my favorite movie.Don't waste your time watching this. Go find a good hobby like building bird houses or making beer.
2,Boooooooring,"I'm sorry but this movie, while it looks great, is really boring. I like Ridley Scott but 50 minutes into the movie I was ready to fall asleep. Plus the transfer pretty much sucks."
1,Bladerunner - Director's Cut,"I can't review it because you people took SOOOO long to try to deliver it, I got tired of waiting over 6 weeks for it and CANCELLED my order."
2,The Director Had It Right the First Time,"When Ridley Scott decided to make a movie version of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" he took on a daunting task. This short novel grabs the reader from the beginning and won't let go until the story is over. I couldn't put it down. To translate that to the screen, Ridley Scott appropriately added a voice over narration to help explain the development of the story. In his director's cut, he removed this voice over and made it all but impossible to truly understand what is happening in the story. I love this movie, but refuse to buy... ...the Director's Cut. Even though I know the story, the film is just not complete without the narration."
5,Blade Runner is Best in Blu-ray,"There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is a comparison of the BD vs DVD version of the ""Final Cut"". The BD version is by far, the best version released. The audio and video is the clearest ever, and the added remastering in Final Cut exceeds the transfers of the other versions included in the disk set. Blade Runner is a visual experience, the better the video and audio, the better the movie is too. The clarity of BD immerses you in the experience, as if you too were there. Enhanced audio is exquisitely clear and has superb imaging in 5.1. You can see the stitches in the clothing, and so much of the background that was once blurry now reveals details of a noticeably Japan flavored sets. If you like Blade Runner, Blur-ray is the best version of this movie to date, and I've seen them all: the original and blurry theatrical release, laser disc, VHS, and 2 DVD versions!"
5,Fan of the original!!,"This version has it all!! The original theatrical release and the Director's cut all in one! Sorry to all you film geeks out there but I for one love the narrated version of Bladerunner much better than the Director's cut! Call me an 80s teen who loves to be handheld, but Harrison Ford did a great job helping the viewer get into the thoughts of his character! Highly recommended to all you fans of one the greatest sci-fi's ever made! Why? Because Ridley Scott's vision of the future is one of the few that appears to be coming true (give or take 100 years!)!"
3,Director Cut Bites Electric Sheep,"When will directors leave well enough alone. I haven't read the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", but everyone loved the original version of this movie or the director would not have had the opportunity to do his cut version. Well I like the orignal and I'm glad I still have the VHS of it because when I bought the DVD and it didn't have Deckard's narration or the final scene I was truly disappointed. I can only hope this studio comes out with Classic Blade Runner, and the Directors version goes the way of New Coke.Okay I have had a slight change of heart. After all they at least had the foresight to put at least some version on DVD. To many studios are sitting on their backsides while their incredible movies rot rather than putting them on DVD. I only hope they will show some concern for fans of the theatrical release and put it on DVD as well."
4,on the Director's Cut,"I love the film, both versions. HOWEVER, one thing most reviewers seem to overlook regarding the Director's cut is that we already know the film and are familiar with the general film noire approach to the story, character interaction, development, and so on.Classic film noire often needs narration. Even if Ford initially narrated poorly on purpose, it kind of fits in with the character. Besides which, the D Cut does nothing to replace the narration, so there are great gobs of panoramic dead air, with maybe a bit of background music. It becomes a struggle to stay focused. I tested this with two of my Media Studies sections, and the narration kept the most audience attention hands down, not to mention a keener grasp of the film.I think a perfect marriage would be to include the extra footage, the D cut ending, and selected portions of the narration."
4,Can we ever expect the theatrical version?,"I understand why people prefer the DC version of this film,but personally i prefer the Philip Marlow style voice overof the theatrical version; i can certainly live without thehappy ending of it though (which somehow reminds me of thecomplete destruction performed by USA networks on Brazil)ideally, a single DVD would have both versions (like DarkStar)I have both the theatrical and DC versions on VHS, but onbalance prefer the theatrical - any chance of that gettingreleased on DVD?"
3,I like the theatrical version better.,Warner didn't took advantage of the DVD format by adding the special features(like the theatrical trailer) and a 5.1 soundtrack. I had to tune up the volume up to 20 decibels(I own a home theatre system). The picture quality looks better than the 97 release though. I didn't buy this new DVD because I borrowed it from a friend and Warner did not do a good job with this years release. I hope next years release is better like the size of a mammoth loaded with lots of goodies. We'll see.Roy Batty is freaking hilarious in his last minutes of his life. :)
2,WARNING! THIS ISN'T REALLY BLADE RUNNER!,"The packaging for this version should have large red letters across the front: ""THIS DVD IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE MOVIE YOU ALL LOVED."" Instead, it just says ""Director's Cut."" The whole Film Noire atmosphere is gone (no Harrison Ford narration), there's a stupid emphasis on a unicorn that makes no sense, and the ending of the film has been removed. I agree with some other reviewers; buy this version only if you understand what you're getting. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed."
3,No Narration = No Bueno,"Any Blade Runner fan knows that the directors (""Final"") cut doesn't include Harrison Ford narrating above the story. I have never read the arguments For and Against this - I just have my opinion: I vastly prefer the narration. I have tried 3 times to watch the Final Cut version, and it's just simply not as good. And I'm forced to do that because the non-final-cut version isn't available anywhere. Pretty frustrating."
4,Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray],"Well the movie is great, but you already know that. It's a 5 star in any format! I do have some questions on my Ultimate Collectors Edition? Did I get some sort of bootleg? ""In addition, each briefcase will be individually numbered and in limited supply."" I have look over my package with a magnifying glass and can't find any 'number'! I would only downgrade this package, because of the packaging. Just buy the 5-disc version!"
3,Director's Cut - Good and Bad,"Although the sci-fi braintrust has welcomed the Director's Cut with open arams, it has both improved and detracted from, the overall experiences.The added scenes are nice, and the lame ending is eliminated, but the opening narration does leave a big hole in the movie. One screenwriter brought up an excellent point, that we've all heard the narration before, so our mind automatically fills in the blanks when we watch the movie without it. If it had never been present in the theatrical version, Blade Runner's opening would be boring, slow, and confusing to a great many patrons.For that reason, I prefer the Theatrical Version to the Director's Cut, just marginally, though both are pretty good."
4,Amazon needs to sell the original version,"The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does..."
2,under whelmed!,This DVD was supposed to be encased in a steel box/case as pictured and promised; not so. I did not have the time to undo the shipping required for refund or reorder due to this purchase being a birthday gift.
1,Director's cut? They cut out all the good parts!,"First to say, I'm a huge Blade Runner fan, but this has gone tooooooo far! Director's cut? What the hell was Scott thinking? I liked Harrison's nariation and the ""Happy ending"" is good! Not to mention that the original movie (when it came out on video) was ""Not rated"" but the DC is rated ""R""! Give back the orignal!"
3,What happened to the variety - consumers should decide!,"My family purchased a VCR many years ago. Cable TV was only in my part of town for a few months. I was young and the first movie I snuck a recording of was the ORIGIONAL Blade Runner with the voice over narration and what many call the ""phoney happy ending"". Ford's narration seems to give the movie a little character by explaining his thoughts throughout his life as B26354. Now I don't really care for the origional ending, but what gives with the unicorn dream? The director's cut's ending seems to give the movie a ""Well, we're out of film"" cut-off image. Overall, in my opinion, both versions of the Blade Runner film should be offered in stores/online and let the public decide which is better. I'm hesitant to buy the Director's cut because of the changes from what I know. The movie in general is awesome, just give the public the ability to choose which way their version of awesome should be."
1,Big Disappointment,"I don't get what all the fuss was about, this movie really wasn't worth the time spent on it - even in Director's Cut format. As a fan of Cyberpunk novels (Neuromancer, Snow Crash, etc.), I have been told many times that I should see this movie. Now I have, and I must say I wish that I hadn't. Movies like Strange Days, The Matrix, or even 5th Element are much better."
2,most over rated sci-fi movie ever!,"i don't understand why this movie is regarded as a masterpiece? i've fallen asleep every time i have attempted to watch it. the story is boring. one man hunts down escaped prisoners. whopee. nothing we haven't seen in 40 other movies. the twist is that they are all robots. wow. the ""mystery"" of whether harrison ford is a replicant or not is not compelling. maybe it's because harrison ford's acting is so wooden and boring that i just assumed he's been a robot his entire career. the only good thing about this movie is the production design. however even that gets boring and monotonous. everything is in the dark. how about a daylight scene to contrast it with all of the dark? BORING SNOOZFEST. if you want a good ridley scott sci fi movie, rent ALIEN, even though that is really a horror movie. still, the characters are more interesting and the story more engaging than this over rated piece of crapola."
3,"It's nice to have choice, but this seems wasteful","Not sure why one would buy the 4 disk SE and not the 5 disk SE, but I am sure people have their reasons. Price might be an issue, with the extra disk costing $25 more. If you're not that big of a fan than you should for the 2-disk edition and not the 4 disk edition. If you are a big fan you should just for the 5-disk. To see a workprint of a film is a rare and wonderful thing indeed (the workprint is in fact the extra disk of the 5 disk version). I have the feeling that the 4 disk version won't be around for a long time, with most people opting for the two options above."
5,The Director's cut is superb! THIS is Blade Runner.,"When Blade Runner was test screened some of the audience didn't ""get it"". The studio panicked & forced Ridley Scott to add the narration, cut down some of the sensitive (slow) scenes, & add a silly ""Blue Skies"" ending...that shot-out-of-nowhere fly-over of snowy mountains (a shot that the studio BOUGHT from ""The Shining""!) for a more up-beat & less thought provoking ending. Typical cowardice, in my opinion. The Director's cut shows what a difference creative control can make. It is a truly great film, in any catagory. The fact that it is Sci-Fi shows how ill-served we Sci-Fi fans have been. Why are there not more films of this caliber out there? Look to the Studios for the answer. (I worked on Blade Runner, as a Modelmaker, & am still in the VFX trade.) END"
5,Theatrical version a must see,this contains the original theatrical version which is a must see for anyone who enjoys sci-fi. The original version is much better than the director's version. This set which includes the original version alone is enough to buy it. From looking at blockbuster and hollywood it doesn't appear they will be offering it for rent.
2,Bring back the Theatrical Release,"I saw the original theatrical release of Blade Runner and was dismayed years later to learn that the director's cut omits Harrison Fords narrative. Why was the narrative removed? I don't get it.... I want to buy a new, high quality DVD based on the original Blade Runner release where Harrison Ford narrates.... To me, the movie just isn't the same without the narrative sound track."
1,Studio Got Lazy On This One,"Warner Bros. shouldn't have released the Director's Cut by itself. They should have released a Criterion Collection containing the Director's Cut, as well as the Original Trailer, the extra violence only seen overseas, the footage cut from the Workprint (such as the Holden in the Hospital scene, and Zhora's snake dance) and maybe a Director's Commentary since almost every other Ridley Scott DVD has one! The fact of the matter is that there are way too many extra features never before seen to produce a DVD as bare-bones as this one is. Personally i would love to see the trailer, the hospital scene, and the extra violence but unfortunately this basic DVD is all that's out there."
3,the first cut was better,"i don't buy this ""director's cut"" business. despite what critics have panned as a ""forced voice-over"", there are some important descriptive narratives in the original theatrical release. when bryant refers to replicants as ""skin jobs"" and we understand the derogatory implications via voice over, this is all lost without the narrative.i want the original. plain and simple."
5,DVD presents Blade Runner as the sympthony it is!,"Classic film as we all know, and what a delight to see the sharpness of detail in all the cityscapes! Also, I totally agree with the reviewer who points out that the voiceover in the original version adds a depth to Deckard that is lost on the Directors Cut. I would even go as far to say that the ""sunset ending"" provides a breath of fresh air after a heavy film...and no, I am not a movie exec. If you like BR get the disc!"
5,Blade Runner (4 disc edition),"A must have for any Blade Runner fan. The behind the scenes, interviews, the making of, even the creation of the costumes are fantastic! Disc set also includes the final version, with awsome music scores and special tweeking that leaves subtle clues as to what's really going on. Hint: watch the eyes."
1,My least favorite film ever.,"I find this film unbearable. The acting is very sub-par. Harrison Ford isn't good . The dialogue is forced and trite. The character development is non-existent. At no point in the film did I care what was going on. I wanted a giant asteroid to obliterate everyone so the film would end. Also...why, oh WHY, is Rutger Hauer running around in his boxers and slamming his head through walls?! It doesn't make sense, nor is it even slightly entertaining.I have never been so angry after watching a film. It put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. _Blade Runner_ is probably the least entertaining film ever made. I would rather have an anvil dropped on me than be subjected to this film again. Avoid this film (as well as another horrible ""classic,"" _Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb_) at all costs.(sidenote: the special effects are quite good)"
1,Blade runner Final cut should be left on the floor,This cut of the film is clearly less than the original. Parts of the most beautiful poetic statements were left out and replaced with mood more mood and more mood. The marketing people have created a product where there should not have been one.
1,Really?,"I guess I just don't get it. I've seen lots of cheesy 80's sci-fi movies but I never thought to classify them as masterpieces. Aside from the out-dated effects and crappy acting, it didn't even make sense. I have a hard time sympathizing with a ROBOT. Great, it has feelings. By that standard Short Circuit is a filmmaking masterpiece too. IRobot made a statement about society, but I don't see that here. You want to see a filmmaking masterpiece from the 80's? Go watch Conan the Barbarian. If you can't see how well that film was made then don't tell me I'm close minded because I can't see the greatness of this cheese-fest. People need to grow up. It's a cheesy 80's flick. Just cause you like it, doesn't mean it's the greatest movie ever made."
4,Didn'r Receive What It Says,"I'm sure everybody knows this movie is great. My problem is that when I was sent the notice that this was coming out the page informed me this was a briefcase version with a Spinner car and other things. But oh, well. Would have sold that or thrown it away anyway since I'm packing all my discs in CD books for traveling around."
2,Stick with the previous release.,"Yes, there are some added sceens, but they don't make up for the fact that the narations by Harrison Ford have been removed. Save your money. If you have the original versions, stick with them."
2,Director's cut vastly inferior to the initial release,"Normally when I see the words ""director's cut""I think ""ALL RIGHT"", the real deal! Well,not in this case! Do yourself a favor and getthe original (if you can find it). I saw thisfilm when it was originally releasedand WOW! I loved it. I purchased the director'scut and everytime I showed this version to afriend, they had no clue what was going on.Hey, sometimes the director is wrong."
4,Some good things lost..,"Blade Runner is one of my all-time favorite movies and the pioneer for so many science fiction films that have borrowed from it.I loved the first version I saw years ago and own on tape. So I was disappointed with the latest final cut. While the picture quality is outstanding, I missed the voiceover narrative that makes Deckard the central character and lets us see the story though his mind and emotions. This time there's hardly any distinction between him and the replicants which I suspect is what the director wanted -- to blur distinctions between humans and replicants as much as possible.I miss Deckard's musing about why Roy let him live and I liked the getaway on the train and the notion expressed by Harrison Ford rather than Olmos, that we don't know when Rachel or anyone else's number will be up. And I agree that for some odd reason we have less sympathy for the replicants in this version.Too bad they have to keep tinkering with a masterpiece. Bess H"
2,Not impressed,"I had seen Blade Runner as a teenager a while back and came away from the movie thinking it didn't really go anywhere, it didn't seem to be much of a story. I thought it was because I didn't pay much attention to the movie and I was a teenager and just didn't get it. So I bought the DVD (because I was on a DVD kick) and watched it. I came away feeling pretty much the same, but what is worse than not liking the movie is the DVD is such poor quality. The sound is horrible, and there isn't any extra features that make it worth buying. If you like the move buy the VHS version. The only thing I liked about it was laughing at some of the 80's hairdo's in it."
2,what happened here?!,"I saw the original theatrical release, and when I heard there was a ""director's cut,"" I imagined that there would be lots of more scenes from the ""deleted"" ones, etc., but definitely no what they did. The voice over adds a great deal of understanding that it is needed for a better grasp of the motives of the characters. The so called ""phony ending"" is a definite absolute requirement for psychological resolution and hope. This release at least should had offered both versions. I own the original on tape, and so hard to get, but VHS is dying. I was hopping for the DVD version, but it does not look is going to be one."
3,A change of feel...,"Though the movie looks excellent and the story is still awesome, I find myself really missing the voice over from the earlier version. The running internal monologue of Harrison Ford's character vastly improved the depth of the film, in my opinion. So, the original version gets my 4 stars, while this version only gets 3. Still quite enjoyable."
3,A classic sci-fi flick with one major flaw,"The director's cut of Blade Runner is clearly the better of the two releases. While I find Harrison Ford's performance simply adequate, the supporting cast, especially Rutger Hauer as the leader of the replicants, do a bang-up job. My biggest gripe with the DVD version is that it's not in letterbox format. It seems like a complete blunder to me. Anyway it's still worth checking out."
2,Somewhere between hypnotic and immensley boring,"This film is one of the biggest sleep inducers I've seen so far. I rented it, hearing it was a sci-fi classic of some sort, and found myself constantly wondering why. I first must admit that I really loved the visuals. The special effects and excellent photography are a delight. This film demostrates Scott's trademark gloomy photography and snail pace. The film is shot almost entirely at night, and everything looks as gothic as you can get in a 21st century setting. This is all arresting at first, but as the movie settles down for it's overlong, confusing, feckless, and totally BORING story, not even the visuals are able to save it. I had read once that Ridley Scott had originally planned to direct TOTAL RECALL, another short story by Philip K. Dick, when the screenplay was still in the works. I felt relieved that he hadden't. It also made me wonder what Paul Verhoven would have done with this movie. That thought leaves a lot to be desired."
5,I've never seen it look so good!,"I've seen Blade Runner on VHS, Laserdisc and standard def. DVD and even in the theater and I have never seen it look this good! I know the movie very well and watching the Blu-Ray disc I'm noticing things I've never even noticed before throughout the movie. I can now notice all lot more subtle details.The image and sound quality is even better than what I experienced in the theater because the print in the theater was probably old and degraded. They really gave this high definition DVD the ultimate treatment when doing the transfer and it shows.Aside from all the extras like diferent versions of the film, the work print, the interviews and the commentaries (which all rock) the experience of this film is stunning! On my 60 inch HDTV I feel like there is nothing better.This is worth every penny! I consider it a must own!"
2,Very Weird Movie. I Didn't Understand What The Hell Was Going On.,"This so-called classic movie is nowhere near a classic. Honestly, I didn't understand what the hell was going on in the movie half the time...and I didn't even finish watching it. I got through an hour and seven minutes of it before I finally gave up. I will say one thing in its favour, though: the director's vision of a futuristic L.A. was really good. Avoid this trash. Like Total Recall, this is one sack of garbage you'll be glad you didn't see."
2,Just to put my 2 cents worth in...,"I saw this version in a theater and I have to say I felt ripped off. The missing naration doesn't add or detract from the movie, in fact, I kinda missed it. The ""unicorn dream"" sequence is footage Ridley Scott stole from his 1983 disaster ""Legend"", the movie he dumped ""Dune"" to make. The only other major difference is the lack of a happy ending. The real story here is that this is not the definitve version of the film. There is another... a friend of mine saw a sneak preview back in the day in which Deckard was a replicant (remember all those old family photos on the piano?). Maybe one day that version will see the light of day and we will have a real ""Director's Cut"". Until then I say stick to the original."
4,Great Classic - Great Making Of...,Who doesn't love this movie? It is phenomenal; I don't need to tell you that. I loved the extensive making of and all the interesting facts and the trials behind making the film.Worth the bucks.
3,My favorite movie....but the director's cut is inferior,"I'm no Ridley Scott fan, and his changes to the film weaken it greatly. Everytime I recommend this film to one of my friends, they invariably grab the director's cut and are underwhelmed. I wish someone would re-release the original, put in widescreen, and put that on DVD. I have had no complaints concerning the original; everyone who watches that version has nothing but positive things to say about it. Scott bungled his way into a great movie (read Future Noir) and should keep his hands off one of the best films of recent years and stick to 'G. I. Jane' and other tripe."
3,Wait for re-release of original theatrical cut,"Blade Runner is a visionary film, and Ridley Scott deserves much of the credit for that vision. However, much as I hate to admit it, the film studio was right to insist on the changes made for the original theatrical release of this film. This ""Director's Cut"" suffers from its conformance to the wounded ego of a director who should have know good advice when he heard it (the narration actually helps the film--despite Harrison Ford's lack of gusto for it--and the unicorn scene is superfluous at best. I continue to wait for the DVD release of the original theatrical release--a true classic."
3,Directors cut or original cut,"After reading the reviews posted here, I am glad that I am not alone when I say that the original cut of the movie was better. We all know why, everyone else here has said it already. DVD has its advantages over the standard VHS format and deserves its credit, not the movie. I will be forced to watch the DVD version and my VHS version of the European cut until the it comes in it 'correct' format. Now I need a DVD ram to put my 'original' cut onto disc before my tape is worn out due to watching it too frequently."
2,Don't Waste Your Bucks,This is a mostly terrible collection of re-recorded hits. Find compilations of original recodings and you'll be much happier.
5,Good Old Days,"Great, great album...Serch proved he wasn't just a white boy gimmick (like the Beasties were) and proved he could rhyme on this LP...the lyrics, the beats, everything about this is just pure crack..."
3,What a find!!,"What an awesome find. I found these and they are the exact thing that AutoZone sells for over twice as much. I bought two of these and the special socket and still paid less than I would of for one at AutoZone. Thanks Amazon!Updated: Well, I thought these were a find. A few days after installing them, the dreaded SES light is back on with the same code. Replaced with some Denso's and they have worked great for over a year. No more Bosch O2 sensors for me..."
1,2 tracks that's all I liked,"Why?? and Still Feel meI was hoping this cd was gonna be like ""Kiss The Game Good Bye"" , but sadly it was not "":("" If ur a die heart Jada fan COP THIS CD NOT , but if u are not ""I WARNED U"".Peace!!!!!"
2,OVERATED,I CANT STAND THIS GUY WITH HIS STUPID A** LAUGH. HE IS TOO OVER RATED. THIS ALBUMS NOT THAT GOOD AND THAT WHY? SONG IS STUPID
1,I don't like this cd,"I'm telling ya on the real this cd is a bad cd I mean it.Beats C-Lyrics BOverall CI'm sorry , but he needs to work with better people this album needs help.I still like Jada , but please work on it next time around."
4,J.A.D.A top 3 alive,"I can't bare reading how some of y'all are hating in that cd ,lyrically and musically jada has improve from his first cd, honestly i think the commercial tracks should have been minimize and that joint with Kanye west shouldn't even make the album overall the album is inches away from being a classic it has unquestionably put Kiss as one of rap elite How come j-hood ain''t on that cd?"
3,Overhyped,"This CD was very hyped so I'm sure I wasn't the only one with high expectations. Overall the CD is aight, but nowhere close to great.Best track is ""Why"".Why? Don't ask me, listen to the CD and judge for yoself."
5,Jada The Lyrical!!!!!!!!!,"I Love jadakiss he is the best!!!!! I'm listening to knock Yourself out right now. Kiss of death was a hott album. I like Hot sauce to go with Pharell and Kiss of Death. ""f the ask what happened tell 'em its the kiss of death."" The Kiss Of Death!"""
3,"Just ""OK""","Kiss of Death has a few good tracks. Time Is Up is great musically and lyrically, thanks to Nate Dogg, and Why has a great feature in Anthony Hamilton. However, Jadakiss's rhymes are yet to impress. Starting every sentence with ""why"" in a song is a definite ""DO NOT"". Still Feel Me is an all around good track, but it is short and weak on bass. Aside from that, this CD has little to offer for the true rap fan. Look to Cunninlynguists or The Roots for proper beats and rhymes."
5,he's back!,"I've been waiting 4eva 2 hear jada's new album & it's finally here! amazing cd! all the calabos R cool, xept the 1 w/ mariah carey/it's kinda wack. Jada and styles p. spit it out on the track shoot outs. and on the swizz beatz track, real hip hop, jada and sheek tear it up. Eminem also graces the album on the track welcome 2 d-block. he produced it. Knye West also drops by on the HOTT track gettin it in. This album is increidble, and much better than kiss the game goodbye(which is a 4 star album!) keep spittin kiss! HOLLA!"
3,its a 3 outta 5,it sucks compared to some of his mixtapes. the worst songs are his love songs and light party songs (k-i-s-s me is exceptanly good). He should stick to the hardcore jada we all love and f the commercial stuff
2,One word: Hype,"Way to hyped for such a poor cd.Where is that one song ""The Champ Is here"" ? That's what I was looking foward too - Instead I got a Ja Rule album apparently.Only reason I gave this CD 2 stars is because of Welcome to D-Block - the only REAL song I was feeling on here.Everything else was garbage/definition of ""wack""Not the best of '04 AT ALL. Not even a candidate."
3,I Expected More For the Price,This software is too expensive for what they provide. All of the really great features about this software are OPTIONS that cost half again the price of the software.You cannot really get proper bang for your buck unless you resell copies to about 10 others for several hundret dollars a piece.
4,The Border Collie: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet,"This bookis extremely helpful but sometimes confusing. It teaches you how ot train, groom and how much your breed needs in food maters. This book will definatly help new owners fighure out why there dog does what it does, and how to fix the situation"
1,Price Change,It is sad to see that almost all of the reviews of this product are now obsolete. The praise that this set received was largely for its sub $100 price tag. Now the price has ballooned to $300! It's quite a shame too because Shakespeare is amazing and should be a part of everyone's home library.
5,Cheaper than buying the individual paperbacks,The individual paperbacks are priced at $5.00 and $6.00 each. The full set (in hardbound) averages $3.94 a book. The text appears to be identical to the revised paperback edition. Having the plays in single volumes makes it easier to read them (see Al Pacino discussing this issue in Looking for Richard). This is a great deal for a great set.
5,Impressive ... and inexpensive!,"Months ago I added this Pelican collection to my ""wish list,"" way back when the 38-volume set was marked down by half, from a reasonable $300.00 to an outstanding bargain of $150.00; but when I found the price had dropped lower yet, to an astonishing $94.99, with FREE shipping, I could contain myself no longer.The books arrived today, nicely packaged, and I am well-pleased with them. Superbly crafted, this set is similar in quality, I think, to the Random House Everyman's Library series. It is a collection that should last and last, from one appreciative generation to the next.Personally I can't think of a better deal...at $2.50 per volume, this set is an absolute steal.Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare: A Guide to Understanding and Enjoying the Works of Shakespeare"
1,totally unrealistic,Why would it go up from under $100 to 300? It is silly to think I'd pay that much for a collection which originally sold for $99. Price went up that much in 3 years? stupidEven dumber its now up to $600+.
5,SOUTH PARK!!!!,"South Park rocks. Period. The first season was much more vulgar than the others and by vulgar I mean better. If you don't buy this then you are ""Hellastupid!"""
2,The Audio Pops Are Very Annoying,"For such a hit show, you think they'd do a good job on the dvd production. The audio & video are great, with some stereo effects I don't remember being on the tv versions...but there are a plethora of audio ""pops"" that are loud and very distracting. I felt I couldn't enjoy the show because I was anticipating the next POP! Also annoying are the intros before the episodes by Trey & Matt...why aren't these bypassable or at the end of the disc as extras? I could stand the intros if there were no pops, but both together are too much."
1,Hella Ripoff!,"The episodes are great, but what a ripoff! The commentaries by the series' producers are available on CDs via a mail-in offer! Why? Because they are afraid children will hear some salty language? This series isn't made or marketed for children. Am I going to watch the DVD and cue up the CD at the same time? Are you kidding me? Boycott this kind of consumer abuse!"
1,Not as advertised,"I excitedly preordered this DVD set because like everyone, I know that the T&M commentaries would be as funny as the episodes themselves (See Cannibal: The Musical). This DVD set supposedly had a lot of extras that made buying it worthwhile, but I found out just after my DVD was shipped that they had pulled everything from the DVD, including the introductions that you can get on the original individual DVDs. What's with that?? Don't buy it! And be careful about preordering!"
4,"Heartfelt, informative and entertaining","Kahn has done it again. His prose, from the unique perspective of veteran baseball writer who cares about his subjects, is at once soothing and revealing. Kahn's appreciation for the history that he witnessed - and helped create - is sure to enrich any baseball fan's appreciation of the history (to say nothing of vitally important players both on and off the field) of this great game."
4,A real-life possibility in many parts of this story,"Do you think your mate is 100% compatible with you? Do you think that is even possible? Many say no, but this book peeks into that with a twist. Finding that perfect mate ends in death for one of them. Not the happiest ending one would expect.I appreciated how simple the characters were in the story, making it seem more real. Dr Lash is brought back into the story and even finds himself wondering if he has a perfect mate.I won't spoil any ending, but you start to assume it towards the middle of the book, but you forge ahead knowing you just have to put together how it was done.Good book and a fast read"
4,A fast paced thrilled,"Once again Lincoln Child spins a tale that makes one think! He weaves the plot around a computer program that matches up ""the perfect couples."" But something goes wrong when the couples start committing sucide. You must read the book to find out the reason why!"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","I'm a big fan of both Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I'm also a fan of their work when they're not working together. As for Child, Utopia was neat. Deep Storm was a joy to read (and the first work I read that put me on a path to reading everything they wrote). Terminal Freeze was great, especially since I lived at a radar site in Alaska for awhile and I could easily relate. I'm really looking forward to Third Gate.However, Death Match was, well, boring. My wife and I listened to it in the car on the way to work, and we both had it figured out somewhere around 1/3 of the way in. I personally thought the characters were a little two dimensional and cliche. The action wasn't very exciting, and the final scene was more complicated than it needed to be.I'm still going to give it 3 stars because it was a fun read. Not a read I would visit again, but a fun read nonetheless."
3,Entertaining but completely predictable,"The book was entertaining, a good mystery. However, it was completely predicable. After I figured out what was going to happen it was difficult to enjoy because there was nothing left to learn."
2,Couldn't finish this book,"I have read all of Child's and Preston&Child;'s books and have never been dissapointed until now. The storyline became so un-believable that I could not take it anymore.**SPOILER**I stopped reading the book during the chapter where they lost control of the computer and they couldn't turn it off (because it controlled the power), they couldn't slow it down (because it had redundant systems), they couldn't bash it with a sledgehammer (because all of the computer housings were rebuilt w/ hardened steel cases), etc... All of this for a computer system used for match-making?The monster in Relic was actually more believable than this."
2,Death Match Drag,"I loved Lincoln Child's other e-books from Amazon but ""Death Match"" was a bit tedious. The hero Dr.Christopher Lash was an animated mannequin. The plot along with Liza the super computer being the killer was obvious from the fourth chapter and was a rehash from a thousand books and movies from the seventies and eighties about computers killing people and or taking over the world. I give it two yawns, Speed Reader."
1,Awful piece of junk!,My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday. I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster. How difficult would it have been for the designers to actually figure a way for the arms to lock in place?? They do not stay in the back at all. This toy has since caused tears and frustration. Don't buy this piece of junk!
2,No Proper Table of Contents,"This book does not have a proper Kindle-compliant table of contents. This makes it difficult to navigate. I guess it's worth a dollar, but unless you are devoted to buying only the cheapest version of Poe's works, I would purchase another."
1,Problem Opening the stories,"I have been very satisfied with all the books I have downloaded from Amazon. I would like to read the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, but unfortunately, I cannot open the book. It is there, but it resists my attempts at opening the stories. Is there anything you can tell me to obviate this problem?"
4,"Classic Rap, five stars when it came out in 91","Third Bass was at the top of the world back in 91. They transcended race and they came off as legit rappers. But for some reason, they didn't stay together and they only made two albums, this one and the cactus album from the year before. I know it's not popular to say this, but I liked Pop Goes the Weasel. I think they were just messin' with the Vanilla Man."
3,cheesy but still pretty good.,"this film has a considerable number of actors who later went onto larger bigger things.Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, ""Tony Soprano"", Christopher Walken.... just a really solid cast and all were up to par, the dialogue is pretty cheesy and the movie is slower than what comes out nowadays, I remembered this movie as being one of my top 10's of all time but having re watched it I can't support that position any longer, it's a good movie best left to the younger and more naive generation that I'm no longer a part of."
5,All time Classic!,"I have watched this movie many times but it still captures me with something new each time I view it. I love the playful yet gritty nature of it, the colorful characters and the masterful blend of action and romance. If you haven't see this movie watch it now!"
5,Great Movie...Excellent in Blu Ray,"True Romance has always been one of my all time favorite movies. This movie has everything suspense, drama, action, and comedy. It's an excellent transfer in Blu Ray."
3,Tarantino At His Average,"This wasn't what I thought it would be. I expected a romance or something and it's all action. But for this kind of movie, it's fun but language is serious and violence is MORE serious. For Quentin Tarantino, it's about average which means an enjoyable violent, fun crime movie (as if violence is ever fun). But the stars in this blew me away: Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, and the list keeps going. Just when you think you've seen them all, another pops into the scene completely unexpected.One of the wierd things about this, is that except for a VERY drunk and high Brad Pitt (perhaps playing himself) throughout, none of the big names made another appearance after you first saw them, and yet the way the story moved, this still works here."
5,Mandatory Action Movie,"What else can I say about True Romance other than it is basically a literal ""Must See"" for anyone with functioning senses?Nothing."
3,a good romance if you like Christian Slater,I love Christian Slater-so I actually like him in anything. But if your looking for a great movie pass this one by. It is a good rent. I wouldn't buy it. If you love love stories then this might fill your afternoon. Not a must see but a cute movie.
3,Fun movie-three stars,"I watch this one every few months and I never get tired of it. One hell of a ride, with some funny lines thrown in. Also the dialogue between Walken and Hopper is UNFORGETTABLE. Highly recommended, though, if you are sensitive to graphic violence, rent it first, it's quite bloody."
4,True Romance Directors Cut,"I love the movie, hence the 4 stars, but, feel the 2nd Disc is basically worthless (hence the reduction by one star)."
4,True Romance is Truly Outstanding!,"Great movie, recently recommended as a ""re-rent"" by Roger Ebert's new partner (can't remember his name). Outstanding performances by Gary Oldman (a personal fave) Christian Slater and Dennis Hopper. James Gandolfini and Christopher Walken add hard-edged muscle to the well-written script."
4,Wow!,"This is by far the finest film Christian Slater has every been in or perhaps every will be. Quentine Tarantino drafted this film at age 19 and wrote one of his greates accomplishments. This is a wonderful, Seven Samurai type of film.. Love It."
4,Even better than the first act,"Act 2 continues right from where Dirty Pair Flash: Mission 2 - Act 1 left off. Kei and Yuri go into the background for a bit as Toma steals the first episode, making for what could be the funniest episode in all of Dirty Pair Flash. The second and last episode switches around and has a lot more action than the rest of the mission, with Kei, Yuri, and Toma finally getting around to their actual assignment."
5,Great Book!,"Great book for exam preparation, or just as a reference. Typos are extremely rare. The sample questions in the book and on the CDROM are accurate--virtually devoid of typos.The CDROM practice test actually works, unlike some others I have used. It has both study mode (you can peek at the answers) and exam mode. After the test, your score is presented graphically, and each question is marked.If I had to pick a bone with this book, it would be that the pages are only half filled up. The text takes up a center section, leaving a wide margin on the outboard sides. This causes lots of code/file samples to wrap unnecessarily with a somewhat annoying arrow icon. On the other hand, the white space makes the text easier to read.The author stresses that you must have experience to pass the test, and he suggests ways to practice specific operations to gain that experience.With a book like this on the market, there should be a glut of Solaris 8 Network Administrators on the streets soon!"
3,Slightly disappointed,"I was very excited to buy this CD as I'd heard some Raffi songs and really liked them. Some of the songs are great but after 2 weeks of listening to it straight, I am slightly bored. And this is someone who has had a Laura Berkner CD in my car for 3 years that I'm still not sick of. I was also disappointed in some of the lyrics. The Spider on the Floor song references the word. ""dumb."" and ""I wish I would die."" Not great for my 4.5 year old who repeats every single thing he hears. With all that said, my boys really love the songs and have memorized them. But because of song #11, I would probably not purchase this particular Raffi CD again. But will still consider his other CD's."
5,My 18 month old loves this CD,"I just got this, but she already loves it! We have an hour drive to the sitters, so by the time we get there, she usually is not in a good mood and is kind of reluctant to be left at the sitters (I guess my singing just doesn't cut it- lol). However, this morning, she was singing to the music and giggling at some of the songs! Can't wait to hear her sing again :)"
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"As a pre-k/kindergarten teacher, I have used this collection by Raffi for several years. As any educator knows, if a tape or cd doesn't work with the children the first couple of times it is used, the recordings go back in the cabinet and gather dust until it's pitched to make room for new ones. This one will gather only beaming smiles and singing voices! Brush your teeth, count pumpkins, shudder with plastic spiders, and go down by the bay with the watermelons! Start singing and learning with your little one! This is one of Raffi's best!"
2,"BIG RAFFI FANS, BUT THIS IS BORING!!!","My 23 month old daughter loves her Raffi videos, so I though this would be perfect.I was looking for a cd that had all THe songs she loves from the tape, this had the most & had great customer reviews....ha!This is slow, boring & I THink the sound quality is a bit off."
3,Slick Rick is slick,"I love Slick Rick. I thought I would love this CD, but most of his songs sound the same and the lyrics are much more vulgar than I remember. Or maybe it's different now that I am older. Anyway, I like it and am glad I bought it, especially for the super cheap price!"
3,Good Idea; Writing Average; 3.5 stars,"Flynn's first novel is based on a good idea. Suppose a real scientific theory of history is possible? Suppose the scientific theory of history had been discovered, not once, but several times in the first half of the 19th century? Flynn constructs a contemporary adventure story around ths idea. Competently written, this is an above average read. The plot is clever though too busy. Characterization and quality of writing are average."
4,Quality Thinking,"Next to The Universe, and Ancient Aliens, this is our favorite show. We love how Morgan Freeman's childhood is woven into the programs to explain what could be very complicated theories. Well done!"
1,For beginners.,"This book is certainly for beginners. Book does not contain useful advanced or important advice that is needed daily basis for adminitrating ESX server. If you are administrating running environment, this book is not for you."
3,Very useful material,"I believe this book has a special message for those who are seeking for answers in life. It sounds like the fashion today is to be just controversial to anything that comes along. I am wondering after reading all the reviews if the ones who really defend the author's idea have really read the book, or in another hand the ones who are mocking the author's idea are really doing it with a open heart to Her message... I definitely think that anyone who honestly approaches the core of the book's message, is able to have a more completing understand about God's love. Great book, I am still giving only 3 stars because I need to read more about the author and this way I hope to grasp more completely an understanding about Her goals, backgrounds and/or issues that make people so unloving about her books. But so far till where I know about the book itself, I feel like a true letter from God, which came to my hands after the holy bible, which I would put always first."
4,Helpful for beginners,"This is a book for everyone who needs the get an idea about the gmat. It's more of a warm up before moving to the real books such as the official set of books which are the best tool to test yourself. I would suggest Gmat for Dummies for those who are scared of the test, this book makes the test not as frightening as it looks."
1,NOT DVD!!!,"This is another Amazon rip-off, selling a DVD-R as a DVD.Amazon is doing this more and more - calling them DVD's and often disclosing DVD-R info well down the page."
4,OH BOY...........LET ME SEE.....................................,"okay, now for me it was the beats. the lyrics............well...........he was better when he was with 3rd bass. all in all this album is alright. it is not a classic, but i enjoyed it for the nostalgia. i will say this about it, it is nice and raw like i like it. the bad thing about it is that it wanes near the end. to me, daddy rich makes this album along with the beatnuts' production."
3,Pretty good probally 3.5,"I like the album a little better now but it still seems like he doesn't bring like he does on Wordz of Wisdom. The beatnuts sound pretty good. i just wish it was more fire, If you like the early Beanut sound and Pete Nice then you will have no problem with this album. Get it before the price goes up more..it was 35 cents on my first review"
2,Lens Stuck,The A550 is the same mehanical design as the rest of the series. I had a Canon A540 that worked fine for 10 months then for no apparant reason the lens did not retract. This is known problem with Canon cameras (do a web search to find lots of instances). I returned the camera to Canon since it is still under warrantee. They claimed that it had impact damage - which it did not - and wanted $103 to fix it. I will NEVER BUY a CANON camera again. I had the same problem with a Canon A20 a few years ago but that was out of warrantee.
4,Snappy deal,This camera delivers superb quality pics.The auto-focus feature helps you shoot pics like a pro.Best camera for the price.I love it.
3,"works well, but not as sleak in design or materials","It is a good camera. I have had no problems with it after a month, and the pictures have turned out for the most part pretty well. It doesn't seem like it's very good at night sometimes, but I haven't mastered the night settings or shutter speeds yet, so I'm just talking about the auto setting. The optical zoom isn't very extensive, and forget about using the digital zoom, it's useless. It doesn't seem to be very heavy duty...a lot of the parts that you would think would be metal are made of plastic. But this also makes it lighter, if that is a concern.Overall, I would recommend it. But the next step up in quality might be worth it, if you are looking for a camera that looks ""neater""."
5,A big Bang for your buck,"The best camera i ever purchased. Point and shoot, with a host of other advanced options. For the amount i Paid , Its just spendid. Would recommend this camera for first timers and others who dont want to get too technical about photography."
3,Good pictures but....,"I purchased this camera a few years ago. It has taken good pictures overall (it's not an slr quality of course). I liked the size and feel of it in my hands. It has the neccesary features I was looking for such as red eye, sport, and movie abilities. The down side to this camera is after a year the shutter had trouble closing and so the lens would get dirty. I also noticed that it was getting slower to capture each picture."
3,Defective Lens Cover,"Somehow we lost our Canon A70 after 4 years of flawless service. This A550 seemed like an incredible replacement with many more features at a fraction of what we paid for the A70 in 2003. But the first time I turned it on the lens cover didn't open fully. I turned it on and off 50 times but it got stuck the same way every time. It's noticeably misaligned. In fact, the craftsmanship of the whole camera seems to be a big step below the A70. It has a lot of features for the money, but we have serious concerns about the quality.We returned it ... not sure what to get now."
5,Excellent camera for eBay & Website,"I bought this to replace an earlier model Canon PowerShot (which I gave to my husband). This one is much lighter because it only uses 2 AA batteries instead of 4 AA's like the older model. I sell on eBay & website and the colors, clarity, ease of use are excellent. I highly recommend this camera and would gladly buy another for myself or a gift."
3,Good given its limitations,"As a documentary photographer I dislike digital cameras and think that in all respects except convenience they are inferior to 35mm SLR cameras. But sometimes sheer convenience trumps camera build quality and photo quality. In that case, this tiny and fragile point and shoot zoom has some things going for it. Compared with similar digitals it's as good or better. Ken Rockwell waxes enthusiastic about it on his website, but then his photos usually aren't made under difficult conditions. If you need something like this, it's a good value. For closeups and middle distance shots, under good lighting conditions, the resolution is acceptable, particularly on a computer monitor. The Canon software that comes with the camera is clunky but better than nothing. The price makes it a good value, today. Like all digitals, it will be obsolete in a few years if it's not broken."
2,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this camera from a pawn shop, while I was trying it out the battery light kept flashing, I thought no big deal it just needs batteries. So I bought it and I have been replacng the batteries ever since, y the 3rd picture it shuts off. It does take great pics though but you just can't take a few and choose your fave cause you can only take a couple at a time."
4,"Great quality, easy to use and just the right size and weight...","I bought this product for my 10-year old boy's digital photography class and it works out to be a winner in class, the kids love the video option. The batteries did run out in class and he was able to replace them with regular AA batteries handily. The only thing I hoped could have come with the package was a longer strap, to wear over the neck, so the camera won't drop(even with the hand strap on). It might be a good idea to include both a hand strap and a neck strap in the package for the customer's option."
5,Small package; BIG photos,"I still shoot 35mm film with my Canon AE1, but I've been looking for a small digital I can carry in a pocket or small bag while traveling. I've always trusted Canon's quality, so after research, I chose this one. I just returned from Alaska, and found this little camera went places my film camera couldn't.. like trail riding outside of Skagway. The camera easily fit into my jacket pocket and I could still photograph from the back of a moving horse without dropping the reins to focus. I never really thought I'd find a digital camera that could perform as well as my trusty Canon AE1, but this definitely does at 1/4 the weight. Get one!"
1,Kindle version is an absolute waste of your time and money,"No table of contents. No way to figure out what play you are reading without going back to start of the play. No indication of how far you have progressed in the play. None of the nice features described in reviews of the hardcover version - just straight text with no annotations or introductory essays. An absolutely poor execution of conveting what likely a great book into a less than substandard kindle edition. AMAZON, PLEASE PULL THIS TITLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY. ."
2,Not as expected,"This was advertised as being a critical edition. Instead it is simply the Gutenberg electronic version without helps (at least for the IPhone). But it works for my purposes, if as somewhat of a disappointment."
2,Basic,"You get what you pay for, and you can get so much more for just a couple cents more. In this Kindle ebook, stage directions fall right inline with the text, undelimited, hard to distinguish from the dialogue. Also, the speaker's name is not offset. The Mobi editionComplete Works of William Shakespeare. 154 Sonnets, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, The Tempest, Julius Caesar, King ... Cressida, The Winter's Tale & more (mobi)is just a few cents more and puts stage directions in brackets and tabs in the speaker's name. Those are subtle differences that actually make a huge difference when reading the play."
4,It is all here!,"This is a complete set of Shakespeare's works including his sonnets. This version boasts an active table of contents and works great. Using the search feature, I can look up all of Shakespeare's best soliloquies and lines. The only short coming is that the current act and scene does not display at the top of every ""page"" though I am not sure this is a feature the Kindle2 actually has in the first place. This is a real economical deal and you can carry the entire collection without throwing out your back."
4,what do you expect for .99 cents?,"This is the whole works of Shakespeare for one dollar, and there is a table of contents. Just press ""previous page"" when the book first comes up on your kindle. My only complaint is that the history plays are not sequential in the TOC. Still, a great deal by any reasonable standard."
5,Great Bookshelf or Rear Speakers,"These make great bookshelf or rear speakers. I would not recommend them as the primary speakers for a main home sound system, but at ~$36 apiece, this should not surprise anyone. They make a good auxillary component of a sound system.I could also endorse the SS-B3000 for use as main speakers in situations where budget, space or neighbors in the next room/apartment place constraints on how big/bassy your speakers can be anyway: kid's bedrooms, TV in the garage, dorm room, etc. They're not bad speakers."
5,Fenomenal sound,"These speakers look and sound outstanding! I got these to complement my polk home theater set. Most of the things I listen have only 2 channels of audio (cd, pandora, netflix streaming), which means only the front speakers will work, so I got these to give my home theater a boost, and let me tell you I could not have been happier (cant tell the same about my neighboor)."
4,Excellent value for clean sound,"I use these speakers for music played from my computer via a high end amp. They are an excellent value for surprisingly very clean, true, reproductive sound when running flat (no tone adjustments) at, what I consider, low to moderate levels of volume. These speakers do not need a graphic equalizer for balancing out ""soft spots"". The only disadvantage of these speakers: they are energy hogs and need power, in part, because they are wired at 8 ohms. These are not speakers for vibrating furniture and windows, but will impress an audiophile. I'm very pleased!"
2,Budget theater or house party speakers,"I gave these a try based on all the good reviews.For music, they sound terrible. I listen to hard rock and heavy metal.The frequency response is really uneven with brittle highs and early break-up.They do get loud. They're good if you want some cheap house party speakers.They're lively and image decently well for home theater use.I ended up getting some old Polks off craigslist for less money and better sound for music."
4,Good,"These are good, low priced speakers. The sound is not an full and the audio resolution not as clear compared to a nice set of floor speakers, but they are good for bookshelve speakers. Television and movies seem to be better than pure audio recodings (CD's). Good quality for the price."
4,They Serve My Purpose,I simply wanted to receive better sound from my Mitsubishi DLP HDTV. (These sets provide excellent video with not so great audio.) I paired the Sony SS-B3000 speakers with an equally inexpensive Sherwood receiver and made my humble wish come true.
5,Love It!!!,"I'm not the first to say how this has entertained my daughter for hours on end. I just hit replay and she is in the playroom singing and having a ball. Baby Beluga is her all time favorite song ( and she's a huge Laurie Berkner fan) and as I understand from her teachers it has been for children everywhere for 20 years. It was a little hard to find (not in stores), but well worth the effort!!!"
2,Reading this book was hardly worth the struggle.,"Lucia Robson St.Clair's novels have always been in the ""can hardly put it down"" catagory but this recent novel""Mary's Land"" set in early Maryland history was a struggle to read. The story began with the promise of another wonderful historical drama but after the main characters landed in the colonies and began their new life,the story started to wander and never seemed to find its footing again.I was discouraged but glad to read comments from other readers. I learned I was not her only fan who must have been shaking their heads and furrowing their brows as they struggled through this recent novel by a favored author."
2,Just not as good as previous efforts,"Harbinger and This Fire are great- very original. The first time I listened to this CD, I realized that I had stopped listening after the 2nd or 3rd track. The songs were just not as distinct as those on her first two albums."
5,Love this album,"the first time I had this CD, I left it in my car player for days. Very good work. Often the first album of an artist is the best."
4,Highly Underrated,"This genre-hopping album has been consistently bashed for its poor attempts at hip hop and its sophomoric lyrics. And unfortunately, this (...) Grammy nominated singer has mysteriously dissappeared since this album's release.While it doesn't hit you with the initial impressive womp of ""This Fire"" this album has a great deal to offer. You grow into its moody mellowness like a comfortable glove. Paula effectively hops from blues mama to hip hopper to dance hall diva. And while some of the lyrics are a tad surface, they are always sincere.Whatever you're doing, Paula, I hope you haven't given up on making music."
4,"Beautiful, rich vocals. Not overblown in any way.","Paula Cole has the ability to ""go off"" with her vocal prowess like Michael Bolton and his falsetto histronics however, she doesn't, and it is a welcome surprise. Amen opens with strength that I haven't heard or felt in a long time. Yes, it sounds like ""Disco"" but, it is much more than that. Bottom line: Paula Cole can sing and she shows that on Amen. I really enjoy this CD."
3,beware of the lyrics.,"the new paula cole cd is like a self-help book. it's not bad to listen to but it isn't doing anything substantial. it's a cd that makes wonderful background music. when i'm not focused on what she's singing and i'm just hearing the music of it, i'm fairly satisfied (though it's still not as original or captivating as harbinger) but when i listen to the lyrics like ""the girls all whisped 'hind my back/my baby brother's smoking crack/the boys they want only one thing/and so i give it, don't complain"" i wonder what paula is thinking. anyhow, if you're a paula fan you're going to end up buying it anyway. but please, beware of the lyrics."
5,i want to be somebody. you are. amen to that!,"this is one of those albums that you buy after listening to the first track, and a few seconds of the others. this is an album that you buy because the person who is singing is the one who is inspiring you to think and to feel. this album is paula cole through and through, but in a completely different light. the album kicks off wth a song that relates much to the position of tiger on the this fire album. much anticipated, but finally arrived, this is paula's most fierce album (maybe not most fierce song), with an excellent title, from an excellent woman. i believe in love .... i believe in paula cole, and i don't think that any words i am capable of saying would do this fantastic album justice. paula, you certainly are somebody."
2,Far from good,I enjoyed her first cd so much I cant believe this is the same girl.There is 2 or 3 good tracks the rest are boring and yes I listened to it at least 10 times thinking I might change but no it did not happen.
3,Now Made of Cheap Plastic,"I've used Vornado fans for decades. So, since my one of my large 700 series fans started having issues starting up (it'd just sit there until shaken, then spin), I ordered this. I was shocked, after opening the box, to find this fan made of flimsy plastic. I'd prefer to pay more and have a decently made fan, not something resembling a toy.I guess items are going to continue to be made lighter and lighter (saving on tanker fuel to get from China to the US), until everything will be light as paper. Then we'll get to watch our new fans fly around the room, due to lack of weight. :-0Its body is larger than my old 700 series, taking up a larger footprint. It is better in that it is designed to sit in its three positions without falling back onto its old default position, like my old fan does. Thus the 3 stars."
2,Disappointed - doesn't work for me,"I have not found this CD helpful in getting to sleep. Roberta Shapiro's voice is not all that soothing to me, and she repeats phrases, which I find annoying and want to respond to with ""Yeah, I heard you the first time!"" Sorry, I really wanted to like this CD but I don't. I use Steven Halpern's ""Sleep Soundly"", which is all music, or one of the ""Detaching from the World"" CDs. I'm considering getting ""Pillow Music"" too."
5,Sleep Will Come,"This is the one cd I cannot be without. First of all you can skip the introduction and go directly to the part that you want. I like it that Roberta's voice is ""normal"" not whispery soft and and overly dramatic as are some others. And there are long stretches of great music with special effects and beautiful visualizations with which she completely relaxes you. When you hear the sea, it really sounds like the ocean. The countdown sequences are so relaxing you cannot resist sleep. I have been an insomniac for years and this is the only thing that has helped me. Most of the time I fall into a deep sleep before I even finish. If you need relief from insomnia, this is the one cd you must have."
2,not pleasant,"This cd would be great IF it didn't use the word ""negative"" constantly! That is what we all try to get away FROM! and the cd uses it over and over, I returned it."
5,History at your fingertips.,"This is a great book detailing early girlie pulps. It's filled with history and has a ton of pics. Really, Really makes we wish there was a book on Enoch Bolles art. If you are into pulp or pin up art this is a must buy."
3,Nice sailing adventure,"The old adage, cruising is fixing your boat in exotic places, certainly applies here. The book is very well written, and the interplay of hearing two sides (husband and wife) about the same events adds depth. After reading the book, I think that flying to Grenada, chartering a boat for a month (ooh the hated charterer) and exploring that area was the highlight of their journey, would be better than all the time and discomfort they experiences getting from Connecticut to the Carribean.I tended to skip the social commentary. Can't change what happened, can only address how to help improve what is there now."
5,Night Lights,Good cd. Wasn't aware Mulligan was a pianist also. Tony Mowad uses this tune as a theme song for his radio show
3,Not for tiny dogs.,"Although the label says for tiny dogs, the ball is actually too big for my adult male papillon/chihuahua mix. He never plays with it because I think it's difficult for him to carry. Definitely seems more appropriate for medium dogs the size of a Shiba Inu or American Eskimo. Seems like a good quality toy though!"
5,Very good saw for bamboo!!,"The pull saw itself works very good and effortlessly to cut bamboo but,I would recommend cutting up 2 1/2""inch or the blade mount on the top starts hitting then you have to twist the bamboo a little..I wouldn't recommend using this to cut down bamboo at all unless your very careful that's how I damaged mine with the aggressive angle and carelessness I took.I would use a cheaper saw for cutting down and this for final clean cuts.Overall very good saw.Now I need to buy a replacement blade:)"
2,"Ok, but just ok. Lacked detail and clear storyline.","Like most, I bought this because I enjoyed their other film, 'Trek'. Well, 'Share the Road' isn't even close to as good as 'Trek'. Trek presented a clear storyline and did a good job of introducing the principle characters. Share the Road, however, does neither. For the most part 'Share the Road' is a lot of shots of riding bikes and post trip narration about how great it is to take time off from the daily grind. There is almost no explanation of the landscape and the towns they go through, and only cursory discussion about who is part of the ride.Because I want to support the guys from Circ, I am a bit conflicted about giving this film only two stars. But it really isn't worth more. The film is short, repetitive, and not worth watching more than once. At a price tag of $24 it isn't value for money."
1,Not very good,"I liked all of his past albums but this one isn't good. None of the songs are very clever, it's nothing captivating. In fact, I'd get more pleasure listening to just about ANYTHING but this. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Worst out of the 6 part set!,"I to have the set and when you get to this disk, in order, its like someone elsecreated it. Like what? The music, tone, one of the 4 eps is a haloween ep that justdosent go with the hole series. Another is the wild eagle and is just so completly differentthen the first 12 eps that you eject the disk to make sure you bought the right one. Vol 4in my opinion is not worth the price for what these people are trying to get for it and is the worst disk out of the 6. my (1-5) rating of each ep on this disk which there are 4.Ep 13 The brave wild eagle (1) Ep 14 Fright day the 13th (1) Ep 15 Laon returns (2)Ep 16 The red rival (5). DO NOT PAY THESE CRAZY PRICES for you willregret it just keep looking internet large place. Good Luck!P.S. You have been WARNED"
3,Good information in a sense.,"While I would have to say the information contained in this book is good, I would seriously consider the source. Nancy Mehl, in reading through her resume, is certainly a good author. However, I see no credentials which would make her certifiably knowledgeable in the field of nutrition, or the field of senior health matters.There are some good things in here which are certainly worth reading. But I would beware of taking suggestions from a non-clinical individual, and would recommend requesting information on this subject from a certified health and medical professional before taking too much of the contents to heart."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked. Tried to return it and was given the run around for almost two months. They told me to send it to amazon, amazon told me to send it them and back and forth. I was going to spend a little more and buy something different from them but after all the hassle, NO WAY."
3,Good for the price,There were some very helpful techniques for remembering lists but fell short of teaching me useful ways of remembering numbers and dates. All in all it was worth the small price.
5,Peeking in my window,"Rich's songs speak to me. They touch my heart and soul. It's almost as if He's peeking in my window, seeing my world, knowing what's going on. He sings about my life, about my faith. God speaks to me too, but I don't often understand or even listen to what He's trying to say. Rich was a voice for my Lord, singing to me in real human terms, exactly what I need. He has narrowed the gap between me and everlasting life. I thank the Lord for him. I know that heaven is filled with his beautiful music, and I look forward to meeting him there."
4,Just a review,It was entertaining and easy to read. I read it in two days and that was with a busy schedule. I am a cancer survivor so alot of things were familiar.It would be a good read for someone at the beginning of treatment. Right on target!DocRoc
5,Interesting and Insightful,"As a person who does not normally do a lot of reading, this book was very difficult for me to put down. I felt like a fly on the walls of the Gelman home during this chapter in their lives. I was taken by the very true and quite personal account of life with Cancer. I feel as though I went through the whole experience with Patty and her family. I recommend this is a must read for anyone who is or could be touched by any type of Cancer."
3,Disappointed with the movie,"Granted the story about the first atomic bomb and of the men who carried and dropped the bomb is a very important and interesting part of world history; I found this version to have taken some very disappointing liberties. The movie portrayed these very experienced and elite men of the Army Air Force - ""The Cream of The Crop"" of the U.S. aviators; to be nothing more than a bunch of juvenile, partying; group of con-artists, felons, pranksters, and jokers. It reflected very poorly of the World War 2 fighting men.In addition this version took some major liberties with the true chain of events from how LTC Paul Tibbets was first selected, the forming of the 509th Bomb Group, the training and development of how the bomb was to be carried and dropped, and how there was 4 actual cities chosen as possible targets and why Hiroshima was selected.A far better movie of this story is the 1952 version, ""Above and Beyond"" with Robert Taylor.This version was a big disappointment!!!!!"
5,cat's eye,"Very good!Very happy to find it in DVD since I could not get it in VHS Tape,which is better at the end"
5,Its what she wanted,Got it for my avid movie collector Mother. She loves it. It was in great shape and shipped quickly.
3,Something scary for the whole family.,"Stephen King does it once again with Cat's Eye. Much like Creepshow, 4 stories have been interwoven to create 4 tales involving the central theme of ""loss of breath"". General, a tabby cat, is the main character who crosses the U.S. on a mission to save a young girl from an unknown evil. The movie is a chronicle of Gerneral's series of unfortunate situations he comes across on his journey. Lots of fun and a little scary for the preteens."
3,Does the job.,"This bike mirror was easy to install and looks like it belongs with the bike.You can adjust up or down by moving the mirror; in or out by moving the arm. The only limitation is that objects (cars, trucks) appear farther away than they actually are, and the view is somewhat distorted."
4,A good mirror,"I just like the way this mirror works. It is fairly well made, if you leave everything a bit firm but not overly tight it can survive the occasional bike crash. The viewing area is larger than most mirrors. I will admit I have an older mirror for spare parts."
5,STILL THE BEST,I have used many mirrors over the last 2 decades and these are the best hands-down period. They are very tough during falls and very solid during your ride. NONE BETTER!!
5,versatile,As I keep my bike in the closet..I was pleased how the mirror folds inward and downward out of the way as to not stick out and cause the bike to take up any additional space when not in use .... i keep the allen wrench that it came with on the bike in case i need to tighten anything but have not had to do any tightening yet.
5,So Far So Good...,"Really like this mirror. Despite the slight increase in aerodynamic drag, this is more than offset by the increased safety advantage it adds. It will be hard going back to riding w/o a mirror.... once you get ""spoiled"" having this addition."
4,Mirracle mirror,Mirror works great assembly was fast and relatively easy worth the price.I gought one for me and one for my wife we both like them
4,Nice Product,This is a very well designed mirror that installed easily. The only reason for less than 5 stars is that the quality of the mirror itself is not fantastic. I am pleased with the purchase and recommend it to others.Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror
5,This is a very good mirror,This mirror installed exactly as described in less than 10 minutes.It is easy to adjust in use and remains as set without a lot of messing with it.
5,Good Mirror,I picked up this mirror at my LBS. I've tried one other bar end mirror but the vibration was so bad that it was useless. The instructions are easy & it does the job. I like that it folds out of the way when storing my bike in a tight spot.
3,CONVEX -- NOT FLAT,"Regardless of what some viewers have said, this mirror is convex, not flat, which means that cars behind you are much closer than they look in the mirror. I gave the mirror 3 stars because it seems okay if you want a convex mirror."
1,"Sending back, screws don't fit thread","It seems like it should be a decent enough product, however, the screws do not always fit the thread. Trying to assemble this, I have about half an inch of the screw that will not thread into the mirror fixture (yes, I am using the correct screws in the correct location), leading the mirror to jostle freely and not stay in it's intended position. I am very, very annoyed."
4,Nice Mirror,It has a big field of view and installed very easily onto my bicycle handle. Just make sure you have a hold at the end of your bicycle bar and it will install. Comes with two inserts. My mountain bicycle used the bigger of the two. You stick it into the handle bar and keep twisting the allen wrench until it expands inslde the handle bars and has a nice tight fit. I seem to have to adjust it everytime I go for a ride but I do bump it a lot. I can ride through the neighborhood and easily see anything approaching behind me with this. Well worth for the piece of mind it provides.
5,Excellent Mirror,Just as promised - does what it says and folds out of the way. I recommend it to all for on trail or on road.
5,great once installed,"Great once installed. I now have a very clear rear view when bicycling.I spent some time to figure out how to install the mirror. I had some trouble first. But Andy Kaylor's product review helped me out. I second what he says here: ""The directions are a little bit unclear about what to do with piece that goes inside the bar (the directions say to ""secure"" it, but you need to leave it loose, securing only the nut, until it is inside the bar)."""
2,Poor Quality -- A Name Brand Signifying Nothing Today,"Well, big surprise -- you get what you pay for. I got this set a year or so ago for about $5.00. Can't complain on the price, but the smaller knife was garbage. It had a blade that just flopped limply about between the closed and fully opened (locked) position. And there was also a ding type flaw in the blade. Useless crapper. The big one is OK for a letter or box opener I guess, but no guarantees. I've never used it. Winchester name is not wisely used here -- just another cheap Chinese import."
4,Heard about... bought it... super product!!!,"I heard about this product (Flip Album) from a friend who used it the first day he got it. I was sold on how easy it was to use and how nice it looked. I looked at other ""album"" programs and was about to purchase another (Easy CD Platinum) but decided against it after reading so many reviews mentioning system problems. Anyway, bought Flip Album for almost 1/2 the price and am excited to get started right away. I have yet to use it on my own computer (hasn't arrived yet) but my buddies works great and it was so easy to learn. He has Windows 98 and a Dell, and I'm hoping my Millenium OS works just as well. I would recommend purchasing this if you want to send self-running photo albums to friends/relatives. I did not buy the CD Maker program that is recommended in hopes the one that was on my computer (CD Maker) will do the trick."
4,From Disco To Rock,"Only serious fans may know that she was with a rock band Crow during the late 60's long before disco became known. In my opinion, this album along with Bad Girls alone should get her in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. She deserves it.The closest thing to disco in this album is The Wanderer although that's questionable. I like the album cover alot both the front and back WITH AN ATTITUDE! When you listen to this album, Donna sounds a lot closer to Pat Benatar than to Gloria Gaynor. Even disco diva Grace Jones did a rock album that year too, ""Warm Leatherette""!Overall, it's a great album but I don't think it got the airplay it deserved at that time, according to Geffen."
2,Visit Bruce Damer's Website,"With all due respect to Mr. Damer, this book is basically an introduction to what Avatars and Virtual Communities are. Mr. Damer provides a guided tour of several online communities. One or more of thewe worlds no longer exist. This is another example of web-time and how difficult it is to publish a book with a technology topic. I found the book very basic. Visit his web site to learn all you need to know and be introduced to the awesome online worlds. . . and save some money."
2,A Preschoolers introduction to Cyberspace,"This book, while containing much useful information, treats the reader as a purile infant. If you know nothing about computers, the Internet, and Cyberspace...and you enjoy being condescended to then this is the book for you!!!"
4,Oscar Does it Again!,"Wonderful CD from the wonders of jazz. Hey, that would be a good title for an album. Very mellow. Not exciting. Just mellow."
4,A Dog's Tale,"I'm new to the digital books, but not new to reading the classics such as Mark Twain's. This was an easy introduction to downloading digital media and accessing it on my IPad, and it emboldened me to make more use of the digital media through Amazon. If you enjoy Mark Twain's writings, I expect you will enjoy his A Dog's Tale in digital format."
1,Horrible Story of Cruelty,"This was a horrible, horrible story of cruelty. I see no redeeming features to this story in the slightest. If you are an animal lover, this little tale will wrench your heart and will not easily be forgotten. It has to be Mark Twain's worst and I cannot figure out any reason a talented witty man would write such a pointless story of such cruelty."
1,this book sucks dont buy it,the book has no plot and unlike another reveiw this book is only one sucky story I bought it because they said it was good but its not I only gave it one star because i had to Iwish I could give it 0 stars
1,"This movie has ""braces on its brains""",This movie was shocking. I can't imajine how anyone can like it.Lucille Balls version was MUCH better.This film is badly directed and badly produced.Its also very uncreative.Its a BOMB.Rosalind Russel is NOT a very good actress.
1,Mame was better,"The Lucille Ball version was sooooo much better. If you want to see a good version of this movie, get ""Mame"" with Lucille Ball, not ""Auntie Mame!"""
5,auntie mame,"the movie came on time and in perfect condition, who could ask for more. The movie was auntie mame."
4,Auntie Mame DVD,"I purchased this DVD for my father on his 90th birthday. I was very pleasantly surprised that the DVD was received in a very short period of time. Dad, having spent his entire 50+ year career in the theatre business, wanted to play this DVD immediately. The DVD was in excellent condition as was the packaging. Dad will get a lot of enjoyment out viewing this great quality DVD."
2,Missing the best part,"I bought this because I have to get my occasional dose of a couple of the songs...especially ""We Need a Little Christmas"" Well, I watched it through...and no song. What happened? I even watched it again, just to make sure. One other song is missing, as well."
2,Charging Issues,"We purchased the AW722 for my slightly deaf mother, who loves them. Very comfortable. However, they won't stay charged for more than four hours of TV time, and she watches TV all day long. The very short time they stay charged seems crazy to me, and I have no idea how to contact a manufacturer to see if this is normal. We recharged and drained and recharged three times, as per instructions, but even now, the charge won't hold more than four hours, five at the top. Too much hassle to go in and balance them in the cradle, then let them charge overnight, only to use them for four or five hours and go through this again. I'll be returning these to where we purchased them."
5,Satisfied,I once owned these cordless head phones so I knew the product as new and original. To my satisfaction these cordless head phones that I just purchesed were as if they were new. I was very happy with the purchase.Thanks
1,Duh?,whats the point of asking customers to write a review if you don't intend to show it? I wrote a review on this movie because I thought the previous reviews were misleading. In my review I stated in not so many words how awful the movie was. Glancing through the reviews again today all I can see is reviews written by individual who thought it was pretty marvellous . . . I actually bought this movie based on these reviews . . . my lost of course. Money not well spent.
5,Great Movie,I love Kadeem Harrdison....I just loved this movie and would advised anyone to watch this movie. To me it was very realistic.
5,The Patriot,"A terrific piece of cold war lore which discets the acute parinoria peddled ""anti communist"" hucksters their own ends. Set on the eve of the Vietnam war it served up a stern warning that must never be ignored. A fabulous period piece by an almost unknown author that is as mesningful today as it was 45+ years ago. I'm only surprised it was never made into a movie."
1,This is bunk!!!!!!!!,"This album is probably the best coaster in my collection. Having Russell Simmons name gracing the production of this album is probably it's strongest quality. The beats are aiight, but the whole horror, satanic thing i'm not feelin. Lyrically it very much like Insane Clown Possee that is complete s&*%! Save your money. There is better rap out there. If you insist on horror in you hip hop then check out the Gravediggaz."
4,Memorable Film Making,"In the same vein as ""The Secret Garden"", ""My life as a Dog"", and even ""Simon Birch"". Excellent story telling and top notch performances with great cinematography. Just wish it was on DVD. Great fun that comes highly reccomended. And best of all, its from England so no subtitles or annoying overdubs!"
1,Misleading listing!,"The picture and Book Description list all 19 Out and About with Pooh books, but when we received our order only the first book ""Good as Gold"" came. This is clearly a scam. Stay away! We have submitted a request to return the book."
3,Old Skool Head,Good for the people that old skool just like me So you can sit down reminisce the the new jack swing was big
2,A young girl experiences world war 2 as a jewish girl,This book was very interesting. The topic at least. Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad. Th plot skipped around alot so unless you can understand difficult reading I would not recommend it.
4,It's All About Attitude,"This wonderful book does not try to dramatize anything. It's a simple, straightforward set of interviews with police officers.There is no ""case"" to make, or any ax to grind.Fifty years ago, Jack Webb tried for the same objective in creating ""Dragnet."" However, as it translated to the TV screen, it instantly became a cliche and the butt of jokes.It's much harder to joke about what's in this book, though. The main consequence is that the reader is simply grateful for the presence of our police, and finds a new appreciation for their daily contributions. Its sheer simplicity is what lends this a lot of narrative power.It was given to me by by nephew Tim, a tactical officer with the Chicago Police Department, and I thank him for the book and for everything he does. I admire his attitude; instead of becoming jaded and cynical, he takes his street experiences and translates them into gratitude for his wife and his two children."
4,What Cops Know.....is enough to scare the hell out of the rest of us,"Using their own words, Connie Fletcher lets a group of Chicago police officers tell anecdotes and stories about the things they face every day when they go to work. Some are hilarious, as you'd expect. But most are tales of frustration, anger, and sorrow, with the occasional triumph when the good guy wins and the bad guy gets put away 'til he's gray. To hear them tell it that doesn't happen enough, but they keep going until they burn out, transfer off the street, or quit altogether. Too often they die in the line of duty, and when that happens, their fellow officers sincerely mourn the loss.It surprised me to discover how compassionate these men and women are...not only toward the victims they comfort, but criminals they arrest and help convict. What Cops Know will give you a true picture of what cops think, too."
3,No support,"To be fair, I am giving them 3 stars. I purchased this book months ago to get me started with XML in Flash. I have not read the whole book, and gave up rather easily. I am not saying the book is bad, I just wanted to say that if you tell your readers the web site will be an ""invaluble resource for learning the ins and outs of using XML in Flash"" you might want to offer more than just the source code.""[URL]will also have message boards and Frequently Asked Questions so you can find quick answers to any questions that need answering.""Please go to the website and look for yourself.[URL]The page was last modified 3/25/2002 and here it is months later."
4,Well worth the viewing time!,"If you missed ""Up The Sandbox"" at the movies, now is the time to make up for it. The wit in this complex movie exploring a mother's daydreams about the more exciting life she may have lost when choosing to start a family may be subtle but it is fresh and funny even today. Barbra Streisand shows her comedic talent in this off beat gem."
5,Good book regarding metrology of electronic devices,"I had read this book because of an ISO 9000 issue after an audit. This book was very helpful on metrology fundamental and uncertainty statement, that was our concern. The explanations are very good for a begineer. Because Fluke is a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment (DVMs, oscilloscopes, calibrators), the book covers only themes regarding the metrology of electronic devices, including fundamental of electronic equipment calibrations. I recomend sections two (Elements of Metrology), section five (statistics)and section six (Laboratory Management). Chapter 22 is very good explaining uncertainty issues. However, the book is focused in calibration laboratories and it isn't clear metrology applications according to ISO 9000 requirements, that is a widely required by many people."
4,To the new and to the experienced,"""Calibration"" reviews some of the most important application notes of Fluke on devices and techniques that are still important to most metrology laboratories around the world. It is centered around electrical metrology, and some of its last chapters are dedicated to laboratory management and control. Just to keep it short, the sections on AC metrology and AC-DC transfers call for special attention, as they are very up-to-date even at the present days.The scope of the book is very large; yet, it can be very specific on most of the chapters, and present all the most important topics and bibliography on subjects, without getting too deep into complicated language and technical obscure terminology at all. All this make of it a book which must certainly be among the prime references of the experienced metrologist as well as people new to metrology, or anyone who, for some reason, needs to make use of any metrology tools."
1,What a load of crap!!!!!!!,"After purchasing all of the bands albums and seen them on many occasions it has led me to realise how poor and infantile michaels song writting ability is. Dont get me wrong he is an amazing guitarist but when he opens his mouth and that dribble comes out it just makes me cringe. So i say, come on michael give up the song writting(your no bob dylan) and stick to being an exceptional lead guitarist!!!!"
4,A helpful guide for dealing with dysfunctionality at home.,"Mr. Jamiolkowski provides the reader with a wide variety of situations and responses, all involving families which are not working well. The areas covered include addictive and abusive behaviors, neglect and overprotection, emotional abuse and religious or political fanaticism. It is the first book I have found which mentions the role siblings, brothers or sisters, might have. The book has a limited but helpful section on where to go for more personal assistance. On the whole, the book appears to be geared toward the teenager through early twenties market."
4,Not the best deal but nice,"I bought this for only $30 from another vendor in overstock. Very nice for holding my machine and accessories. However, the velcro constantly catches on the ground and the outer flap zipper area (visible in the AMZ picture only as a small black band, not the zipper strip visible here) tore within weeks.The back is still otherwise fully intact and excellent: apparently this extra unneeded zipper was a serious design flaw, because I never stress it and the rest of the bag has been consistently stressed without failure.The small top handle is a little too bulky and sometimes get caught between the bag and my back, which is not pleasant, although easily flipped out of the way.All in all, not worth the $60 AMZ is currently asking, but a steal at $30."
3,DV2000T,"I bought this for my DV2000T notebook. It's good but not perfect fit for a 14.1"" notebook. Since this bag is designed for 15.4"" notebooks it was a bit loose for my 14.1"" HP notebook. It has lots of pockets inside and outside and it comes with a nice notebook sleeve that's protects the notebook from bumps and scratches.If you have a 15.4"" notebook then this the case to get. If you have a smaller notebook, then you might want to look for some other case that is fit for it's size."
3,Uh oh,"If you want the original silent film, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It was pretty much turned into a talkie and completely ruined the original. It isn't as funny or as wonderful as the silent film. As another reviewer pointed out, it ruins the fact that the visual acting is the story and the subtitles just fill people in if they aren't sure what is going on."
5,Raffi Resonates!,"I bought this album primarily for my ""new"" granddaughter, but my daughter and I are enjoying it also!!! And Ella (granddaughter) is learning some of the songs, too, at least to dance to and enjoy! (She is 17 months old, but knows what she likes and doesn't like, believe me!!!) And if she likes it, it IS good!!"
4,modern jazz accordion at a very high level of musicianship,"Most jazz accordionists seem to be stuck in 1940; very square rhythmically and harmonically. Victor's compositions, playing and his wonderful trio put him at the head of his class, even if there are precious few in the class! He plays with plenty of space (thank you!) and he steers clear of the usual barrage of ""Lawrence Welk notes"". Bravo!"
5,Love Old Country Music!,"Over all this is a WONDERFUL set. But they did leave off some very good songs. Like: My Turn, If I Had My Way, Long Distance Love, and I'd Say You. But I would still HIGHLY recomend this album to anyone. And In closing this is THE BEST GREATEST HITS album you will ever find from her years at Mercury/PolyGram records."
1,Unfortunately Carly's time has passed...,"I love Carly Simon's music, but unfortunately, her time has passed.The songs are all a bit slow, lacking something from her days gone by. Enthusiasm, passion, a little oomph? Additionally, her voice just doesn't have the strength it used to have and one tires quickly of the wispy refrains. The choice of material just doesn't cut it either. The only songs that really evoked any feeling from me were the ones done with her children. I say save your money or buy Ben Taylor's new CD (her son)."
2,A Snooze.,"The songs on this CD are indeed lovely, but collectively they make me want to curl up in a ball and take a nap. If you are looking for a disk to help with insomnia you've found it!"
2,A waste of a good voice,I was very disappointed by this CD. She made no use of her vocal strength or range. All in all: very boring. Only the most die-hard fans will appreciate this amateurish effort. Save your money.
3,"not remastered, just repackaged IMO","i disagree with the other reviewer. i have this version & the original Capitol one & by my ears, they sound the same. the other reviewer didnt say he actually compared the two side by side.this Japanese version does have the nice mini-album replica, sleeves & poster, but is not remastered.5 stars for the actual concert, but not this version.i'd recommend that u just buy any of the other versions out there & save your money."
2,Sterilized Rock!!!,"I saw Paul (Wings) 3 times during the 1976 tour. He was/is an amazing performer. The performance on this tour was top notch. However, although the sound on this album/CD is great, it is too ""studio-ized."" You do not feel (or hear) the excitement of the audience. You hear the song and instruments as if the microphones fed them into a basement, and that's how the mix sounds to me. As I stated, I was at 3 shows, and although the music sounds like it did live, the sound doesn't. It doesn't even come close. I have a 3 album set bootleg (Los angeles, June 1976; red, white, blue vinyl) that kicks this CD's butt as far as reproducing what the concerts were like. If you are interested in ""experiencing"" the concert, buy the bootleg, skip this one. I'm not knocking Paul or the performance. In fact, if you weren't at any of these shows, you may prefer this type of mix. However, if you were..........You may be (like I was) major disappointed."
3,"Great performance, poor sound quality","This was an awesome live show on the original 3 LP version. Somehow the transfer to CD resulted in substantially inferior sound. I don't know if they didn't have the master tapes available or what, but the quality of the CD sound disappointed me. Also the [price] is too much; I realize that's not Amazon's fault, but at that price they should have given this the deluxe sound treatment. I think the weak sound must be why this isn't available as an American issued CD. Ok, all that aside, it's a fantastic concert, great setlist, etc. If this is as good as it gets, fine - buy this and enjoy it. But it could have been a lot better than this, I know the LPs sounded much better."
4,Great Season,The show has come a long way since season one. I actually watched all of the shows in this season because I found the cases more interesting than some of the over dramatized earlier seasons. I like when the older psychhic lady from Amityville demonologist consults along with the fun Medium Chip brings to the story line!
2,Very BoRiNg!,"This movie was so boring it was a drag to watch, it was cheezy too but I saw worst but I SURE saw better. If you are a fan of Elijah Wood or Mendy Moore I guess you will like this movie but I sure didn't!"
4,The Crucible,In the beginning this book was very hard to follow because it is written in the form of a play. However by act 2 it is easier to follow because you get used to reading it like that and the book gets better and you pay more attention. This book is compleatly acurate but it gives a good idea on how the Salem witch trials happened. Toward the end it gets very gripping and you don't want to put it down. I recimend this book for people at least over 12. It is also interesting to read it after you know the history of Salem witch trials.
4,One young girl can change one old town.......,"Arthur Miller's the ""Crucible"" is a good example of corruption in our human history. This play takes place during the late 16th century (I think) in the town of Salem where one girl persuade almost all of the townspeople into believing there were witches in the town. From there, she starts accusing the innocent people of witchcraft. This play also shows how one girl's love is so strong for a man she loves that she is willing to do anything for it, even if it means getting hurt, or killing people. This is a very touching play of Arthur Millers. This is a book everyone should read to experience how those times were corrupted. People should learn from their mistakes in history, for it may repeat itself......"
3,Arthur Miller is a masterful writer,"I first read this play in high school and was struck by the limited vision and narrow thinking of the characters. With a few wonderful exceptions, these are not people you really want to know. Many moons later I've re-read it and found it as interesting a character study as ever.When in high school in the 60's, we weren't told about Arthur Miller's disguising of the Mcarthy ""witch"" hunts in this play. Much like the T.V. show ""M.A.S.H."" was really about Vietnam, this is about another embarassing time in American history. Although well veiled, it's really does point out the extremes those driven by their own delusional dogma will go to to be considered ""right"" and righteous."
4,Review for Mr. Bonkevich,"The Crucible provides the reader with insight on, not 1, but 2 periods of American history. The Crucible blatantly compares the Salem witch trials to the tumultous time of Senator Joe McCarthy's (R-WI) ""witch hunt for Communists. Arthur Miller provides a thoughtful play that can relate to his contemporaries within Senator Joe McCarthy and the House's Un-American Activites Commitee. There were heroes in such characters as John Proctor that can relate to the people who refused to cooperate with the commitee, thereby ruining their entire reputation throughout the entire industry. There were also Abigail's who would do anything to wipe their hands clean of Communism, including naming the names of innocent people. The Crucible provides us with an interesting perspective on the Red Scare period of American history."
3,A great book filled with dishonor and spite.,The Crucible was an interesting book that comes out in the end. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.
4,The book showed how stupid and gulable people can be.,"The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything. The people pointing the finger were very quick to judge and very quick to accuse. The book was kind of almost unreal. It was hard to believe. I know that it was based on what really happened, but I think that the events were kind of extreme"
1,a secod level play,how can authur miller create such a ridiculus story and so many stupid characters
1,Unable to Read Beyond The First Act....,"Yes, I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's greatest playwrights. But it was just plain ole BORING.Read Miller's ""A View From the Bridge"" (my fave of his) or ""Death of a Salesman,"" to understand what all the fuss about Miller is."
4,"Witty, full of irony and plot twists.",It is a wonderful play which expertly portrays events which could have happened in old Salem. The ending is particuarly great!
4,Classic,"I read this in high school and saw the movie for the same class, and it is not just a play, but a social commentary on that time, including different attitudes like hypocrisy and manipulation. Let me just say that I am glad I did not live in that time!!!"
4,Great,"Very easy instructions for set up, works great. Recommend it - yes ! Arrived very quickly. We have had this brand before - it lasted for years."
1,Avoid at all costs.,"Although I did buy his player a year and a half ago, I'd say I'd be lucky if I listened to 10 CD's on it in that time. I hadn't turned it on in 6 months or so and when I did so today, it just stayed on standy mode and wouldn't turn on. Nothing helped like unplugging it or trying to turn it on with the remote. Completely useless. I bought a new model too, not a refurbished one. This is the first Onlyo product I ever bought, and it will be the last. Now I remember why I always stuck to Sony players."
4,Onkyo DXC390,"This product performs as advertised. I did have some issues with MP3 discs hanging the system. The unit is extremely large, I had to cut a hole in the back of my component box to fit the unit."
1,Save your money!,"I've had nothing but trouble with my unit. With brand new CD's it sometimes will play all the CD's loaded, sometimes not. I have to turn the machine off and on and otherwise it will refuse to play CD #2 or #4 or whatever. If you are looking for a CD player that you just load up CD's and hit play this unit does not work, but the CD's play just fine in my older CD player. Onkyo support does not call/email/write back. This was a new unit. I suggest you save your money."
1,Short Life,Over the years I've owned many cd players. After purchasing my OnkyoI was so impressed by the sound it produced that I purchased a second one for my other system (yes I have two systems). The good news is that this player will play any disc and play through scratches and imperfections. The bad news is that both of my Onkyo's developed problems after 1 1/2 years. The players wouldn't turn on or off from time to time. The drawer wouldn't open. Strange error messages lit up in the display area. To turn off the players I had to unplug them. Very disappointing.
1,Unreliable Product,"Bought this product in June 2008, and had good service from it...until September 2009. The unit refused to come on with the remote or manually. Pulling out and reinserting the power plug resulted in the unit coming on, which allowed me to get all but 1 of my CD's out. The unit, however, will not play the CD that has remained inside. I expected a better product from Onkyo, but this has definitely been a bug disappointment. I certainly would not recommend this product. Heed this warning, and those from the other reviewers who had problems with it. I should have paid attention to the poor reviews, but instead, I took a chance and got a product for < $150, to use for 15 months...Works out to roughly $10/month rental of an Onkyo DXC390"
3,It's ok,I have an Onkyo receiver that is older than dirt and it's still excellent. The Onkyo CD Player needs improvement on the random. The random isn't very random.
5,Great value for first-rate player,"After having enough of my JVC 200 disc changer's random skipping I decided that it was time to finally spend the cash and get something new and less aggravating. After a couple of weeks I am happy to report that this cd player has flawlessly played every single cd cd-r etc that I have played in it from start to finish without one single skip. Also the clarity is downright stunning as I am hearing things that I hadn't even heard before on the JVC. The remote is simple and quick to learn, and also I was stunned that the manual was in English only! I saw this listed on competitor sites for more money and once again found the best deal here on Amazon with free shipping to boot. Very pleased with this purchase and may look to more Onkyo products in the future."
5,Onkyo 6 disc CD changer,"This CD player was bought to replace a 5 disc Sony player I had been using. The Sony became less and less reliable in playing all selections when the player was in the random mode. This Onkyo player works great and is completely reliable in the random play mode. I would recommend it for anyone. Although nothing is said in the advertising about this unit coming with a remote, it does, and the remote has features not found on the old Sony remote. It's a great piece of equipment at at very fair price."
5,Perfect replacement for my old CD player,"This 6 CD player became the perfect replacement for my 12 years old CD player. It interconnects smoothly with my TX-8050, plays all type of CD’s, the random function for all 6 CD’s is great."
1,My Unit Croaked After 2 years: Mechanical Error,"I used my unit for about 2 years until the dreaded ""Mechanical Error"" display message appeared. It froze and that was it. I opened it up to retrieve my discs and could not find any obvious mechanical problem. It was sitting stationary for the entire time and was never moved from its original location. If you want long-lasting quality, try another brand."
2,Don't Listen to it more than once.,"The first time I put this CD into the Discman, I was feelin it. The album was pretty hot. Than I heard it again. The beats are tight, but Bone sounds like Popeye. They gotta slow down the flow."
4,Bone Thugs's CD is great,"I like this CD a lot. I love how the Bone Thugs combine singing and rapping into their songs. It makes them sound unique, which is great."
5,Back In Full Force,"It's good to hear all five of the members of Bone back together. After listening to this album three times straight through, I can safely say that they are back and just as good as ever. I was a little skeptical, especially since Krayzie is only on about half the songs, but the rest of the group stepped up and delivered. Almost every song is good, but the standouts are ""Show Em,"" ""Ecstasy,"" Souljah's Marching,"" ""Resurrection,"" and ""Change the World,"" which is kind of like ""Tha Crossroads."" Plus, this album brings it back tot he style used on E. 1999 Eternal. I don't know what the reviewer for Amazon was listening to, but this record is great. Peace."
4,BTNHResurrection,"This CD is TIGHT! My favorite songs are 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, & 16. This CD may start out a little weak but it ends with a BANG! so give the last half of the songs a listen before judging this CD. It's a must for all BTNH fans!"
4,the harmony is bone,to meany people are comparing btnhressurection to EST.99.and thats not fair.although i do think they shoud keep trying to top it.but people got to realise the harmony aspect is what made them different. and they do it verry well.hence the harmony part of the groups name.as a matter of fact easy-e himself gave it to them.thats what got them a grammy and other awards.i like the hardcore stuff too.but if you take away the harmony they would just be another gangsta rap group who just rap fast.i thought the art of war was 5 times better.but this is still not garbage.but i do wish they would go back to the dark mysticisim they use to have.
4,these bones stay strong,"Bone still hold it down big time in this album. They resurrected for real in this compared to the dissapointing ""art of war"" which put down only five good tracks out of 28 (Thug Luv, Clog up yo mind, Let the law end, Handle the vibe and Body Rott). Resurrection showed that Bone are still capable of holding it down like they did in 95 with East 99. Check out tracks like Ecstasy, Resurrection, Murda one, Battlezone and No way out these tracks had outstanding instrumental as well that thuggish ruggish flow. Tracks like Ecstasy were especially outstanding with Bone displaying their Harmonious flow. This (in my opinion may not be as good as ""East 99, Eternal"" but still keeps me ""BONED UP! "". For any one out there who has at any point in time liked bone, This is a must get."
2,Didnt help me pass yet,This book is ok but youre better off taking notes from a class or another who already passed
5,Gory but Goody!,"I can honestly say that this is one of the most... er... unusual films I have ever seen! When a chemical spill inadvertently resurrects a young woman who died two years before, she does not appear to be very happy to have been brought back as a ""living dead girl"". I suppose this would account for her disturbingly anti-social behavior (i.e. gouging out people's eyes, eating people, drinking their blood, et cetera)....P>This is a thoroughly enjoyable film, although I would strongly advise watching it on either an empty stomach or a full stomach. Unless you own stock in a barf bag company, I really do not think that you would enjoy washing down your Coke and Pizza with images of blood and guts emanating from your television screen.Anyway, this is an A +++++ film! Enjoy, everybody!"
1,too slow,I was expecting more nudity being a jean rollin film. I was disappointed by the fact that it was slow paced and lacked any thrill to the horror. I suggest you not to buy this DVD and try Zombie lake!
3,Nice Mix For A Good Sampling Of.........,"the Basie band recorded in February of 1983, fourteen months before the Count's death. The album consists of a couple of standards, a swing standard from the '30's, an original by Nat Pierce, two by Basie, and two by Ernie Wilkins, one of the three top arrangers of the Basie band. The solid rhythm guitar of Freddie Green as well as the Count's piano can be appreciated on many of the selections.Due to the lack of information on the liner notes(at least on the LP) by the Pablo label during this period, soloists cannot be identified except on the three small group selections (Eric Dixon played tenor and Chris Woods alto).This is a nice, good listening cd that would be enjoyed by big band swing fans and particularly by Count Basie fans even though it is not one of his more popular efforts."
5,Teacher Sub,This CD was used more often for circle time than any other. Wonderful language development tool as well as counting and rhyming. We made props to go with many of the songs and made them interactive with hand gestures. The songs are catchy for even adults and leaves everyone in a good mood. Warning: Some songs are known to drive adults insane as they repeat in your head long after the CD is off. I've seen it used with great results with developmentally challenged children as well as regular education class rooms. The kids and teachers love it!
5,Great children's music that parents will also enjoy,My 2 year old son loves all of these CDs and so do my husband and I. I highly recommend this collection.
5,AMAZING!,"This is AMAZING music for kids!!!!! This music is so good! My parents bought us lots of music when we were growing up - lullabies, Seseme Street, classical music, kids music, folk music, Barney, Disney, etc. - but Raffi still stands out as THE best music of our childhood. Raffi is soooo cool and just really good for kids. I wrote a paper about Raffi at school. He's inspired me to study early childhood education. Stanford, here I come!One last thing... limit the amount of time your kids under five watch TV. I wrote a paper on that too. The exception is Mister Rogers. He's an educator."
5,My son loves Raffi,Bought this song collection for my 2 1/2 year old son. He absolutely loves it! The songs are so very catchy that I actually found myself singing along to one of the cds in the car when my son wasn't even with me!
5,Stereo Pioneer,Amazing stereo...so glad I read reviews and decided on this unit. Great functionality and easy to use. Only fault is only one remote line. There shold havebeen at least 2. So antena wouldnt have to be up all the time.
3,How I liked Taran Wanderer,"The novel Taran Wanderer is a sequel to The Book Of Three, The Black Cauldron, and The Castle Of Llyr. In the book Taran, assistant pig keeper, wants to find his parrents so he can be nobel blood and marry the princess. Lloyd Alexander has taken characters from other books and put them in to this novel. Taran goes through lots of adventure and in the end finds out who he is. It is not the best out of the series of 5 books but it is worth reading. I rated it a 3."
5,BEST GROUP NOBODY HEARD OF,"I bought this used CD here at Amazon from a music store in Baltimore and it sounds brand new. Great songs from their 1975 debut include Hold On, Surf City, She's a Dancer, Ice, and I Don't Have a Tie. The second half contains songs from their 4th CD, ""White Music"". I may be a little biased cause I grew up in M.D., these songs were all over the radio, and they fit right in with the early 80's. They include Poptown, Skin Deep, All American Boy, *Hot Razors in my Heart*, and Techni Generation.Go ahead and google Crack the Sky and the Wikipedia Dictionary will show you why this band never saw the exposure they Deserved. Simply put, if you like Progressive music, there's 10 great songs on this Long-Play CD and it's definitely worth buying."
5,"Perfect album, through and through...","Wow, I don't know where to begin. I got hooked on ""The Red Chord"" with ""Fused Together"" which was a VERY impressive debut album, but this is a little better I believe.The only problem that I see with it is that your typical 'underground metal fan' is going to be a little turned off by this album because they went all out with the production of it. Vocals, guitars and drums are top notch this time around. They are all talented of course, but ""Clients"" really shows it now.But, I am sure they will get the rap like Slipknot or Mudvayne did on their second albums about stepping out of the ""artistic"" music rather then just writing good songs in whole. There isn't a bad song on here, trust me. I got a new found respect for these guys the first time I rolled through this album and now I can't stop listenening to it. It's worth your time and your money."
5,Best ever,"Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie of all. It's the first Disney movie we get to see the prince actually doing something. It's absolutely beautiful, and I will get this DVD, although I now have the previously released 2-disc set."
2,Sleeping Beauty VHS,"The movie is okay, but the box the VHS came in is really bent, wrinkled, etc. It really bothered me. It definitely looks like messy children messed with it."
4,"Not as good as I remember, but still a classic","It's strange that they would release this on Platinum Edition now when they just released a ""Special Edition"" a few years ago. That release was pretty much on the ""Platinum"" status to me. They should have done this then. Maybe this is part of their plan of releasing their classics every 7 to 8 years. I guess they started a little early with this one. I heard they'll be releasing Beauty and the Beast again in a couple of years, so I guess we're beginning another cycle of paying for things we already own. I'm talking about the DVD fanatics, of course. This is still a maybe for me since I have the other version, but I'm still glad they're putting it out again for the future generation. I grew up with it. Others should too. The only cons of this movie: kinda hollow of a movie if you think about it, and the Prince doesn't have any lines at the finale, which was rather strange and awkward to me. Still, one of the best Disney films of all time."
3,Color Me Disappointed,"""Sleeping Beauty"" isn't a very warm or emotionally engaging film, and those of us who love it do so because of its extraordinary design artistry (largely due to the participation of artist Eyvind Earle). The film's use of color is central to its artistic integrity, but those who have digitally remastered ""Sleeping Beauty"" for this Blu-Ray edition have played havoc with its original palette. Scores of Disney artists labored for years to put ""Sleeping Beauty"" on the screen, but a few keyboard-pounding technicians with no obvious artistic credentials have marred its color scheme and spoiled one of its key charms. If all you want is the visual sweep, the sharp clarity, and (heaven help you) the story of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" then this version will serve; if you want the carefully chosen colors that bathed the screen in its original Super Technirama 70/Technicolor release, then you'll be sadly disappointed."
4,Good movie for older kids,"I must admit, priot to buying this item for my wife and upcoming daughter, I had never seen this movie before.The quality of the movie is insanely amazing. The visuals and color pallet have been fully restored to a quality that matches animated features currently in production. Same goes for the sound restoration.But ... the content of the movie was a bit darker than I anticipated. I think, I may have to wait for my daughter to reach a certain age before she gets to watch this movie. Having the main villain ""summon the powers of hell"" just seemed a little too heavy for a younger audience.But it was a good movie though overall."
4,one thing missing a part 2 !,i loved this movie it's one of my favorites but i think they should make a part 2 like when rose marries the prince and they have a child who explores the woods like her mother once did look i'm sorry oh it's ok if you don't agree with me you guys but you should agree with me one day you'll wise up and make a script
1,Disappointed Princess,I ordered the Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Plantinum Edition)DVD from this site and received a bootleg copy. My daughter is three and loves all of the Disney princesses. The DVD was received in original Disney packaging but right away I could tell that the quality was off. My daughter watches the video but there are technical problems when starting the movie. There is an unfamiliar icon embedded in each frame. Queen Mom -- not happy!!!
1,Damaged goods,Neither of the DVD's in this two disc set worked at all. It arrived in a sealed package but we didn't get to see 5 seconds of the movie. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my DVD player. I use it all the time.
2,condition descibed incorrectly,"Item was described as new, still in original plastic packaging. Item arrived in scratched box - no plastic. Embarrassed to give item as gift!"
3,Sleeping Beauty 3 disc edition,"It arrived quickly, however the DVD disc is badly scratched and won't play the first half of the movie. The Blu-ray disc works great. I didn't contact the seller about the DVD issue."
5,Another Disney Classic,"Great for all ages, boys and girls. It can be scary at times, but it is written so well. It's great!"
5,Love Disney,"The classics are always wonderful, and this movie is no exception. this combo is wonderful because you have both blue-ray (in our living room) and normal DVD (family room). This is a must buy if you can find it."
5,fast shipping,I purchased this dvd for a christmas gift for my daughter so i have not viewed it yet but i must say that the payment was extremely smooth and i received the dvd as expected on time! i would highly recommend and would DEFINITELY use again!!
5,"Magnificent, glorious and the best Villain","Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty is wonderfull. The backgrounds are amazing and the animation is spectacular. It's the story of a king and queen who have a child and name her Aurora. But the soon have a problem when Aurora is cursed the evil fairy Maleficent. Maleficent is Disney's best villain. She is clever, has the best costume, and has all the power of evil at her fingertips. A great movie to add to your disney or any movie collection."
5,Stupendous!,"Although I'm extremely busy at work I found time to read this delightful story. Not only is it educational, but it is interesting and a joy for any child to read. My ten year old daughter has read it a dozen times and even my six year old likes it! The author, Mr. Carson should be getting the publicity he deserves. I plan on telling all my co-workers and friends about The Living Mountain. Mr. Carson is also the author a nonfictional work on Mt. St. Helens I enjoyed immensely. Rob Carson is the next great author of the Millenium. Tell everyone you know to buy his books and watch for new ones coming out."
3,staircase of 1K steps: well....,"staircase of 1K steps: well, what can i say about this book? it was okay. perhaps its me, but i found the story a bit hard to follow (maybe from the cast of characters constantly being introduced without any background explanation of who they are). i also found my mind wandering quite a bit throughout the book. on the other hand, i enjoyed reading about an middle east culture and the storyline was good (once i got the idea where the story was going). overall, staircase is okay."
4,"It's so fun, I really liked it.","The movie is so fun; in Mexico the movie never has played, I don't know why, but it's a great movie, but only if you like that kind of movies where tradegy is fun and if you don't have any problems with gay people."
4,Should be a cult classic,"Very droll with witty dialogue and engrossing characters, this movie will keep you entertained all the way. The movie was shot 'on the streets' of Brunswick (a suburb of Melbourne), which was the first residence of most migrants to Australia until the late 1970's (when the yuppies discovered its charms). The characters are honest and charming. It shows the true meaning of friendship."
4,One of several books a collector needs.,"With its comprehensive listing of auction sites, this book contains the information about individual online auction sites that my readers will want while reading Collector's Guide to Buying, Selling, and Trading on the Internet (ISBN 1574321129). This book will lessen all that time spent using Search Engines. I look forward to the next edition!"
2,This weapon is NOT lethal in any way shape or form,"Being a big fan of the first two Lethal movies, I was really dissapointed with this one. It took the whole mood of the first two and made it into a comedy. The first two were like action-drama. Though I love Joe Pesci, he did not help this film out, nor the story, and the bad guy sucked. Worst of all, the had the coolest scene in the movie shown at the very beginning, which tells you that from then on out, the rest of the film will not be as good. I should give it 1 and a half, but the acting between Gibson and Glover fixes that."
4,"Better than LW2, equal to LW1 and 4.","This time the gang go for more of an action comedy, which makes it less bleak than the original, and better than the second installment. The introduction of Lorna Cole made for an interesting sub plot. The villain isn't as good as the previous two movies villains, but he's nasty enough to hate all the same. The opening scene is a bit silly, but at least it's funny."
1,Pseudo-intellectual rubbish,"Names sell books. Susan Sontag's name sells books. But the content of this book isn't worth much. Pretentious, pseudo-intellectual concepts (on the level of a clever college freshman's thinking), awkward writing (trying too hard to find academic-sounding words), in general, just plain silly. Sadly, our universities are full of people who read stuff like this, write stuff like this, and assign stuff like this. As a semi-professional photographer and former college teacher (literature), I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Great Reading -- Interesting Theory,"This was a very enjoyable read. Of course, the book is filled with speculation, but the author does a good job at explaining and often synthesizing competing ideas from various disciplines. His theories, if true, shed interesting insight into how our cognitive abilities for creating and maintaining social structures fit (or don't fit) with today's post-industrial, technocentric societies. Great food for thought!"
3,"Awesome art, terrible argument",Gen 13 was always good because of the characters and art. Don't imagine anything more than that in this book.The history is previsible and very lame.
4,Absolutely Wonderful!,"What a fantastic novel! It combines a great deal of suspense with several romances, the main one being between the Earl of Wright (""Legion"") and Eleanor, the vicar's sister (not daughter, as the back cover erroneously states). As with several Lansdowne heroes, the earl has issues from his past to overcome before he can truly settle down and be happy with his lady. However, he is without a doubt loveable and tender and his habit of taking care of ladies in distress is quite endearing. The female leads are strong, courageous, and yet not at all anachronistic, which I found a refreshing change from the normal spunky heroine. The story is smoothly developed, the conclusion is very satisfying, and the romances are all extremely convincing in their development as well. I couldn't recommend this book more to any fan of great writing, let alone Regency romance."
2,Vs. Another Tupac Documentary,"Another 2pac Documentary basically. same research,same matters, some things not on other dvds/vhs. it's worth renting first to check out. I have the vhs. Ok if your a tupac fan."
5,The need to love.,"This film is a realistic and tender work dedicated to Tupac's memory. A film that troubled my soul, made my thoughts run and run so that with the help of Tupac's music and poetry they could take off. Every fan of Tupac should watch this film."
4,Great book.,"This book is a classic. Donald Goines is dead more than 30 years now, but he knew what he was talking about. Just read this and his biography, and now I gotta get more of his books."
3,a little grimey at times ......... but good,"i just recently discovered DONALD GOINES, i have so far read about 4 of his books and i like him, he kept it real and his books are easy to follow, its grimey and street slick but i like that so i enjoyed this book and plan to read more of his novels in the future !"
3,A sci-fi cheapie from BRITAIN,"You'll find it hard to belive that Britain made a movie this bad--and the most amazing thing about it is how seriously it's film-makers took it. It's like they expected it to be an all-time masterpiece. Oh well, hundreds of today's directors do the same thing (Peter Greenway etc.) so I guess these film-makers of ""the new millenium"" are just as immature as they were in 1954. A husky-voiced alien arrives on planet Earth with her tinsel-foiled robot and harrasses the owners of a tea-house. While she's away getting ready to kill them, some very funny (and very Britsh) dialogue is heard (""While we're all alive we might as well have a cup of tea""). See it to belive it, I'm sure you won't regret it (unless your patience is that limitid)."
1,Devil Girl * a very Bad copy,"This isn't really a review of the movie but rather a review of the video sent out. My copy was so bad (just simply too dark) I could not see any the player in the scene. I would guess it just over copied, as besides dark hard edges in the movie (like walls of a building) were wavy. I returned the DVD and got a full refund. I will continue looking for a better copy."
2,Just the thing if you are short of sleep,"This movie had an absolutely amazing effect! I sat down, ready and alert, expecting to see another of the all time worst science fiction movies that require special talents (and perhaps the ability to see invisible things) to appreciate. Then after perhaps 10 minutes of watching pointless dialogue set in what appeared to be an abandoned stage set from Abie's Wild Irish Rose, I fell soundly asleep. When I next awoke, there was the devil girl and her large aluminum foil robot. Then a brief nap later, her ship was destroyed as the earthlings ""fooled her again."" What a refreshing movie! Get this now if you have trouble falling asleep. It will do wonders for you."
1,Mistake,Someone in my house hold watched this - no clue who or why will not happen again stupid silly sophomoric
5,RAW-Alyson Williams,"I told my sons,the1950 thru the years 2000 was the best decades of having GREAT MEMORIES.They had greatsong like Rapping,Love songs and Poems."
3,Alyson,I love tracks 8 thru 11! Sorry that's it. I think she's a good singer. Producers need to give her better writing and arranging.
3,Quick Read,"This book was a quick read and able to keep the reader's attention. I was rather taken aback by how reckless the protagonist was not only in the commission of her crime but in her failure to cover her tracks to avoid detection. More surprising was the author's assertion that she was intelligent? The book describes the relationship of a waitress, Dee Casteel, and her boss James Allen Bryant. Together they plan the murder of Bryant's homosexual lover. Bryant's motive is money while Casteel's is her infatuation with Bryant and the promise of continued employment as a waitress who will be permitted to drink on the job in order to keep her alcoholic jitters at bay. The author is quite sympathetic toward Casteel which began to get nauseating by the end of the book. This women is no better then the narcissistic,greedy,and manipulative partner she had in James Allen Bryant."
4,works good but its not made in japan,"rice cooker works good considering it's priceit's bulky as one reviewer mention, but heckit's 8 cups capacity i rate it as 4 star since itsmisleading where it was made from it's MADE IN THAILANDnot japan."
1,Burger and Rib Recipies By A Vegetarian?,David Joachim's a vegetarian. What does he know about cooking meat?
3,"Good, but not what I ordered","I ordered this pouch because in the picture the graphics matched the graphics of my laptop cover by Tucano. The cable pouch I received was black, but had different graphics on it."
3,cheap rotor that does its job,"Well I bought set of these about three months ago, installed them by myself in the driveway with no problems. They do work, they stop the car. However after 3 month use they are as rusted as my 8 old year old rotors that were taken off of the car. It would've been nice if they were covered with some hi-temp resistant paint... Overall ok purchase."
5,Excellent gift for all my friends and family,"I recently bought a few box sets for myself and for all of my friends who are music fans. This box set brings the combination of the hip hop beats that I love with the instrumentation of Jazz which you just can't beat! Where else can you get a 4 cd's of straight hit music! Also, the way it is mixed, you can play all of the discs all the way though and it sounds like you have a DJ at your house spinning for you! I actually used it at a party that my friend was having the other day. If you live in the ATL, you probably heard about this on V103. A friend of mine heard it there blowing up. A definite must have for you an anyone you care about who loves music."
3,Great product with one major flaw,and I should have caught that flaw myself but I'll point it out for anyone...I bought this for a friend in the hospital to have some music when they want....The drawback to that...you can only charge it through a computer. A USB port in a hospital isn't the easiest thing to find. If it had a cord to electrically charge it or I could do with just charging it through the USB I would give it five stars.
2,no instructions and no drain included,I was really surprised how cheap this was. until I got it. no drain included!
3,I love Judi Dench,"Judi Dench is a beautiful, fantastic and versatile actress. This movie was too dark, too sad and I wanted to pluck her from that place and that story. I wanted to place her in the beauty of England - amongst the sun and birds and flowers and trees.I have alot of her other movies, but this one didn't pull at my heart strings.A loyal and happy fan of Judi Dench!"
4,Great kid's music...,"I grew up with Dinorock's ""Dinosaur Rock"" in record format(!) and was surprised and pleased to find that not only was Dinosaur Rock in CD format, there were other recordings by the same group! My son loves all of them, but I believe that Dinosaur Rock is the superior album. My son asks to listen to this in the car all the time...when I tell him it's time to give Dinosaur Rock a rest. The tunes are catchy and the story is interesting. Definitely worthwhile, but if I were only getting one from this artist, I'd get Dinosaur Rock, not The Great Dinosaur Mystery."
2,3 good songe not enough..,hearing thoes couple songs gave some great memories but I would like to see some more popular songs on the album.
3,The plot is good but thats it,"I have giving this only 3 stars because the editting of this movie sucks. I liked the plot of the movie. But at one time it showed a Bell helicopter flying over head. During WWII, they didn't have Bell Helicoters during this time frame. Another point I didn't like was when the two Officers were on top of the sky lift. It was poor editting. You can see the sky lift floating with no cables and a haze around the cart. It just looked cheap.But other than this it wasn't a bad movie. I just remembered this as being better than this when I was a kid. But everything seemed better back then."
5,Where Eagles Dare,"Clint Eastwood Collection: Where Eagles DareOne of the all time best adaptations of Allistair MacLean's novels to a a movie. Superb actors help to carry off the story line.I thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I watch it. Unfortunately most of today's movies adapted from books start good and end up getting totally off the story line for ""Dramatic effect"".You really should this suspense filled movie about 7 allied spies dropped behind enemy lines to ""rescue"" a capture American General from the German Intelligence services."
5,"Excellent , excellent, excellent !","Could not ask for a better transaction. The item was in perfect shape, it was if it came off the store shelf. I have and others in the family enjoyed this dvd many times over.Thank You,Rickjfkmaster@aol.com"
3,Whats up with the dubbing,I happened to think that this was a cool movie.Being a ex-marine I understand that alot of thisif not all of it is fantasy but hey its a movie not a documentary its suppose to be fun. My main concern was the dubbing was this an american movie or european ? it was Burtons and Eastwoods voices on the film but it was advanced meaning the sound occured before the action now I dont know if it was my dvd player I dont think so but man that was annoying
5,A Classic and The Best,I won't waste my or your time saying how great this movie is. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.
5,A true 60s classic,"My 18 year old son watched it with me and was most impressed with the quality of the picture, sound a special effects."
2,Where Eagles Dare,"When I order this product, I could not find a ""Full Screen"" one for this particular movie.I HATE WIDE SCREEN!! Wish you would have more Full Screen DVDs/Videos."
1,WHERE EAGLES DARE - Clint Eastwood,It's a shame the screen format with the two black strips all across the display of your TV. That should be improved.The film contents is excellent.
4,"""zees album, she is like zee wooman. . .""","i.e., by rapidly-successive turns she's both absolutely insufferable And absolutely rapturous :) tracks 5 and 10 from disc one, and 1, 4, 6 and 7 from disc two are impeccable and beyond compare to Anything else you'll find out there. tracks 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 and 15 from disc one, and 9 from disc two are distinctly less impressive, though still enjoyable. as for the rest: i haven't bothered to endure pseudochic nattering This indulgently banal (courtesy mm himself, alas) since the interludes on grace jones' otherwise fantastic ""slave to the rhythm"" album :p luckily, the good is mostly separable from the bad :)a tip for international buyers: stick with the american release. while the french issue sports a different (nicer?) cover, it does Not include disc two which, as i just got done pointing out, has some of the best stuff :) sorry, i've no info about the uk version :(vt"
4,Que bueno!,Gloria a su mejor. Gloria at her best. Siempre sera la reina latina. She'll always be the Latin queen.
2,Shakespeare is highly overated,"not to deny shakespeare's incredible talent, but he is certainly overcredited in the creativity area. if you're looking for a true, unique and original read, i reccomend any famous ancient greek playwrite, such as aristophanes, euripides or sophacles. you'll find thier style a little less decorative, and little more simple, but still very similar (afterall, shakespeare did have the works of these men to study and emulate.)"
1,do not use,"I ordered a book, received it a few days after the last day of estimated arrival, and then it was the wrong book."
4,The wonderful Shakespeare,"This is a really good book to buy if you are interested in Shakepeare. I have only read a couple of book by W.S. and I plan on reading all of them. The paper is a little thin, I'm kind of scared of it getting torn, but I am careful with my books, so it's really nothing I can't work around. The cover and binding are really good, very sturdy. I think overall it was worth the price I paid."
4,Expensive,"A valuable book in this field. Better and fuller text than most Quimper books. Along with the average color photos, there is a broad and useful appendix of many small b&w photos. A good addition to any faience library, but -- it is too expensive, even through Amazon.com! Publisher, get real!"
3,"Absolutly for Beginners, Full of typos and inconsistent code","By the time I reached chapter 10 of the book, I realized how many errors in the text and code the book contains. More over, you have to type all the examples in a text editor. Why didn't the book teach the Visual Studio Environment as it is a great and time saving tool for developing ASP.NET application which is the aim of the book. I think too many authors contributing to the book have made it so diverse from chapter to chapter, there is no consistency between what each one of them wrote."
4,pretty good book,"Personally, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty exciting. There are many exciting things that happen, like a car chase, a smoke screen, a dying man, mysterious robberies, a hidden tunnel, an errie ghost, a disappearing floor, a plane crash, a sabotaged boat, and a strange message. All in all it was a pretty good book."
2,Just ok.,This product doesn't spin fast enough to keep the watch charged. My husband has 2 automatic watches and they both went dead in the 3 hour rest time. It just doesn't spin fast enough or long enough to maintain the charge.
5,The best choice for keeping your watches on time.,"It is working perfect with my rolex and omega. With my wife watch, I had some problem with the size of the bracelet size (I easilly fixed it with a workaround). But it is one of my best cost-benefit pruchases I have done. It is not noisy."
1,Poor watchwinder,"This is my second watchwinder. First lasted 2 months, this one 7 months.(Forget about getting your money back). Very good while it worked.Seems to be same as Techswiss model. I wonder why its so difficult tomake a reliable one. its not exactly high tech technology. Ripoff I suppose."
2,Save your money. Lasts only 6 months.,"Its plastic but it looks really great. Silent with a host of features (clockwise, counter clockwise, etc).But less than six months later, the top winder died. So only the lower winder is working now. Which also means I have to get another one coz I have a pair of watches.Read the reviews. On average, I think the lifespan is around six months. If it last longer, it could be just good luck.After reading feedback from other users that pleas for help are ignored, I decided not to bother and buy another better one."
1,"Dead, time has stopped",I have four of these winders and one just stopped dead in its tracks after about a month. I swapped the power supply from another unit and it still doesn't work. I guess you do have to pay alot for a good winder.
2,Very loud!,I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!! We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.
4,Good watch rewinder,I have purchased one of these before and had another single winder from another company which failed. The winder that I ordered I expect to last a long time. Good product.Product imageSingle Round Automatic Watch Winder Burgundy Color...
2,"Watch Winder,","I agree with everyone about the design but you get what you pay for, I bought my on September 14, 2006 today is November 24 and it's in the garbage.One of the watches stopped turning. I tried to open but was unsuccessful without breaking it.One of the little rubber drive belts was gone ,so is the watch winder."
4,Excellent for the price,"This box is the right size for use at the table. It is definitely not too small for family use, but it is not designed to store large amounts of salt. The wood is dry in order to help keep the salt dry. I would definitely buy this again. There are nicer boxes, at higher prices."
4,Cattle Dog,I found this book very helpful in determining the temperament of my new puppy. I have taken some of the advice given on rewarding for good behavior. Biting is difficult to stop since the puppy is teething and I would like to learn more about stopping bad behavior such as this. I did learn a lot from this book and would recommend reading it to anyone with an Australian Cattle Dog puppy. It may even be a good idea to read before you get one so that you know better what to expect throughout the life of the animal.
5,A Must For Parents!,"""One of a Kind"" is a marvellous tool for parents. As an MBTI Practitioner, this is my favourite ""Type"" book for working with children. It very simply and clearly helps you recognize your own preferences and type, as well as childrens.Knowing hereditary life preferences helps you maximize children's potential by developing their strengths, as well as understanding their differences that may challenge you (rather than annoy and irritate you!).My favourite section contains a poignant revelation of an introvert's mental functioning, and page 54 has six Bullet Points to bear in mind if you love an introvert.Besides revealing effective discipline for different types, how to help your child succeed in school, and suggestions for finding a comfortable parenting style, LaVonne Neff also addresses improving family communication and strengthening your marriage. So--DOES it matter what type you marry? Read the book and find out! (Hint--look on pages 85 &86)"
4,Imformative,Very Imformative about Jimi's band and studio abilities. One of the best guitarists of our day. Totally inpretentious.
5,BREATHTAKING!...,"This book was so believable it was hard to believe it was fiction. It just change my life, I couldn't put it down. I have to say the author was superb in setting the stage and bringing a different world to us. This book should be on every shelf in America. it talks so much about life, forgivness, Love, and honesty. if the world wants to get real about themselves this is a book to read. it's just Breath Taking!..."
3,Be careful with caller,We wife bought one from a local store and loved it for a week or so when it stopped working. Best explanation is wewere eating sandwiches with mayo on time and perthaps got a little on thr caller . we tried cleaning but to no avail. We are buying another one but will be more careful. Jim Harris
5,love the Wombat!,"I discovered this book when I was visiting Australia and loved it. I bought a copy while there and have since bought two more to give away. My husband, he's a musician, and I even wrote a song that is loosely based on the book and the story of the wombat. My nephew, three years old at the time, loved (and still loves) the book (and the song!). The story is simple and engaging and the illustrations are very nice. I kept a copy for myself."
3,A classic but hard to follow,"I looked forward to reading this book, because as a Quaker I wanted to read more fiction that involved Quaker testimonies. The book is sweetly written, and entertaining. However, West skips years at a time in the life of this family. It is more a compilations of short story snippets rather than one continuous plot. A good book, but I probably won't re-read it."
5,Great plot twist,It was a very exciting book because it was a mystery and there were more than one murderers. I thought the character devolopment was very well done. The story was worked out very well and the plot had the a very interesting twist that occurred at the ending.
5,Comprehensive resource on AD/HD in women,"This is a MUST READ for anyone searching for more information on how AD/HD manifests itself in girls and women. This would be an excellent resource for medical doctors to help make them aware that AD/HD in girls and women IS real and not just ""in their heads."""
5,"Review of book ""Windows 2000 Security Handbook""","The ""Windows 2000 Security Handbook"" is an excellent book! Not only is it a good book to learn the nitty-gritty details of Win2K OS and network security, but the first section of the book is a great overview of security in general (Win2k and non-Win2K). For someone who is just getting involved with Win2K security, the book is a must. It has both a good theoretical and practical focus; not only do you get the explanations of of the various Win2K security elements, but you get a step by step guide on how to configure each one. The book is also an excellent reference for those already experienced in Win2K. Very comprehensive and well organized."
5,richter,"i purchased this book recently and was very pleased with richter's abstract watercolors.richter does not fall into the anglo-american tradition of watercolor. and, his watercolors tend to be small."
4,Movie has great humour; unfortunately the print quality is old,"This is a great little fun horror spoof, great performances by Dean Stockwell and Biff McGuire, unfortunately the original film print 16:9 aspect ratio is lost and we are left with a semi VHS quality print with numerous color washouts and close-ups. Til we get a restored version this will have to do."
5,I THINK THIS ALBUM IS FLY,"THIS ALBUM(JUST LIKE THE LAST) IS FLY.DRU HILL HIT ME RIGHT IN THE HEART.THE SONG THE LOVE WE HAD,REMINDS ME OF MY EX. I WISH DRU HILL WOULD DEDICATE BEAUTY TO ME.I GIVE THE ALBUM & THE ARTISTS 5 STARS."
5,"IT'S TIGHT & BUMP'N, ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF GREAT MUSIC.","MOSTLY EVERY SONG TICKLED MY EARS I MEAN THE LYRICAL CONTENT WAS TIGHT AND THE MUSIC WAS BUMP'N. DRU HILL TOOK IT UP A COUPLE OF STEPS NOT JUST ONE. ITS DRU HILL AT THEIR BEST. LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY, ""IT'S THE ISH"""
4,This album wasn't that bad and it wasn't that great either.,"I have both of Dru Hill's albums. I'll admit that there first album wasn't that great also. I agree with some of the other reviews, maybe they should let Jazz sing most of the songs. Or maybe he should switch to gospel,too. There's nothing wrong with singing for the Lord."
2,Too Slow!,There was just way too many slow ballads on this album. These guys are great vocally and lyrically but the beats they use don't work well. Need more tracks like How Deep Is Your Love and Real Freak. I think they'll realize it soon though and they're on the right track with that bangin' remix for You are Everything.
4,The album is off da hook,"One word to explain this album is TIGHT. it is way better than their first album and anyone who doesn't like it needs to stop hatin. And you have to give them some credit because they wrote songs, etc, and it went double platinum. The brothas are coming far up from their ballads in the fudge shops of B-more, so give them some credits"
4,The Backstreet Boys of Hip-Hop!,"The CD is a lot better than Dru Hill's first album! ""Theese are the times"" and ""How deep is your love"" just start off the number of great lyrical songs that are on this CD. Sysco has a great voice and they all sound good together. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because all of the songs are about love. They could of put a little bit of options in to it. Like K-ci &JoJo. PEACE OUT!"
3,"3 and a half, actually...Charlie and Cal caught in time..","This LP was released in 1973 (the promo, at least), and it was a very strange time for jazz - even cross-over jazz. Listening today to ""My Cherie Amour"", I don't feel the same way about it as I did then. Then, it was an attempt to popularize the LP for more mass appeal. It didn't work...and yet, I like it now. The one REALLY 5-star tune is their version of Tom Jobim's ""Tereza, My Love"", a stunningly beautiful tune that Charlie plays really well. Cal eats it alive, cascading perfect rhythmic and melodic runs up and down his instrument. ""Tambu"", the title cut, is a movin' Afro-Latino train. It's too bad that this one was caught in a kind of 'time warp'. Hopefully it will get its due."
1,The worst book,"I have read probably twenty books in real Estate in the past six months...this is the worst so far. Whoever is writting is going at light speed and has no concept of teaching or sharing knowledge. It has no depth and he continuosly jumps from one subject to another not covering any of the real issues and questions. The bottom line...don't waste your money.There are ""real good books"" in real Estate but this is not one of them.JC"
4,Kumbia Kings te pongan a bailar!,"""U Don't Love Me"" is a smooth and enjoyable song with the special participation of NuFlavor. Also, their song ""Reggae Kumbia"", appears Vico C and Sheila E., a song which makes you want to dance! Ya'll check it out!"
5,The perfect novel,Simply wonderful. The protagonist makes peace with his stepfather with a gift of Turtle Wax. Multiply this detail a hundred times and you get the picture.
3,"Decent CD, but really more of the same.","This is a decent CD, but you -REALLY- have to be an Elfman fan to truly enjoy it. I bought it for my wife who is a pretty big Danny Elfman fan and even she can not make it through the whole CD. It is great for background noise at a party and is definitely a conversation starter. Just do not expect to rock it out in your car for that long."
1,Damnnnn This Is Just Awful,Hahahah Lil Wayne You Must Kidding This Is Just Wack Damnn Boy Never heard a Badder Voice and Lyrical Performance Than This Just Wack Maybe For The Cash Money Fns This Is a Good Album But People Just Buy An R.O.C Album Or Lloyd Banks Hunger For More Because This Is Trash
4,Good beat,"Ok, im not really a fan of Cash money but this cd sounds good in my car. all i have to say if you have Subwoofers this is the CD to get. There is so much range in the bass, if you sit in the car and listen to the cd you will get a nice massage. and everyone within a 4 block radius will know u are getting a massage, earthquake epicenters will know u are getting a massage.. makes the speakers move."
5,"""i miss my dawgs"" & ""on my own""",i just purchase this cd and i love it already weezy doing that damn thing.
5,Tha Carter is #5 of the top 200 albums,Tha Carter is #5 of the top 200 albums on the billboard charts.
1,Best rapper alive? HAHAHAHAHAHA,"Yea dont make me laugh, best rapper alive?? Yea f*cking right! First of all cash money is THE stupidest name for a rap group ever, even though it does accurately describe the greed and ignorance it spreads like a wildfire through its music. Though i hav to admit Lil Wayne IS the best rapper in cash money (which really doesnt say anything at all when u look at the competition). His lyrics are all about the 4 big things in commercial rap these days, (money, cars, women and jewlery). Man if Tupac, Big L and Biggie were still alive there wouldnt be clowns like this around. If you want to know the REAL best hip hop albums of '04 pick up Madvillainy, 4th Dimensional Rocketship Going Up, Viktor Vaughn 2 and Murs 3:16.(Oh yea, and please click the ""not helpful"" button so i have an accurate count of the number of mainstream loving retards that read this, thanks)."
5,The milestone of lil wayne's career,"When lil wayne first came out with the block is hot, most of the south was feeling him including me. Lil wayne been in the game for a while now. He just gotten better with time and is now one of the best rapper's in the south. Ain't taking nothing away from TI though. He was serious with this cd, even though the entire CD is freestyled. He still came hard with the punchlines and the metaphors. Some tight cuts on this cd include the intro; which is probably one of the hardest intro's ive heard anyone spit, go dj; good single, this is the carter, bm jr; the hardest song on this cd, i miss my dawgs; a song telling us how he feel about the former hot boys, only way, bring it back, ain't that a __, earthquake; which uses a good sample, and cash money millionaires. If you want some straight louisiana music, then cop this cd. Lilweezyana, that's the new planet. Peace!!!!!!"
5,Tha real stuff,"Tha carter cd is the best cd yet on a scale 1 to 10 this will be a 100 but, what you need to do is go cop tha album cause it goes hard. You need to go get the album cause i got it on the release date and it is bangin. Also it has yo new hit single ""bring it back"" so that you know you difinitely need to go cop the album. But really I think its better than all his cd's he eva made. he has flows that will blow yo head off.With yo best dj mannie fresh.Another tight song is that song that say ""go my dj thats my dj"".And that song ""man i miss my dog"" that song was so throwed.Well all im tryin to say is go cop the album. O-yeah yo man birdman is all on the albumduece im out'"
5,Tha Carter,"This is one of Lil Waynes but albums so far. My favorite song is ""I Miss My Dawgs"" followed by ""Ain't That A Bi**h. This a great album for old and new fans or someone just lookin for somethin new. Go out and cop this now."
2,"Lil' Wayne has grown up, but his flow has slipped","While it's true that Lil' Wayne has grown up, unfortunately he's also left his flow behind. While his lyrics are more creative, and his rhymes are inventive, his flow is not as good as it used to be. When i say ""flow"", i mean that he pauses and changes his voice up way too much, which stops you from bobbing your head. i think he tried to do too much. there is very little rhythm to his flow, except for a few exceptions on tracks 17, 13, and some of the intro."
1,You Presume Too Much,"This book starts with the assumption that the African American applicant is sub-par. It goes so far as to suggest that African American students make certain that the college of their choice include remedial courses to assure that they are allowed to graduate (since ivy league colleges have lowered their standards to attract minorities, but have neglected to include remedial studies). I hoped this book would provide suggestions of the best colleges that would widen the horizons of my academically talented, African American child. It gave a list of schools where an African American might actually graduate! I am appalled."
4,Essential Listening For All Derringer Fanatics,"Derringer fans who have longed for his LP ""If I Weren't SoRomantic, I'd Shoot You"" on CD now have a partial reason tosmile. Most of the material from that LP is performed live on this CD. It's a shame Rick didn't do 'Monomania' in this set. Get this while you can."
3,Not quite the page turner,"I must admit this book did not excite me like many of the other novelizations I have read recently. Yes, the Doctor once again saves the world, this time aided by Jamie and Zoe. But the enemy is not particularly well portrayed. The immediate enemy is the Tobias Vaughn, who runs the company International Electromatics. But the real enemy is the largely unseen cybermen. The Doctor's interactions with Vaughn feel somewhat formulatic and the cybermen are lacking in definition. Took me a few days to get through this one as I did not feel the urge to pick it up when I got distracted by something else. Typically theses novelizations can be read in one sitting or are interesting enough that you want to pick them up again as soon as you get the chance."
3,Incorrect packageing,"The Item I ordered was the second season of the program. However, when the DVD arrived, it was the 1st season, boxed in a 2nd season package. Not a good thing to do to customers. Shows poor Q C"
3,I owe Wynton an apology...,"Having listened again to this one after reading the better review from Australia, I now wince a little at my first, flippant one below. Yes, perhaps Wynton was forced to compromise a bit on some of the material - yet his playing really does stand up on the other tracks. I still get goose bumps listening to ""Autumn Leaves"". For a full circle 'retrospective', check out ""Piano Interpretations""...Wynton's very first date in the studio. It is under his own name and leadership. Hey, Jimmy Cobb plays on this one (along with a young Ron McClure I think) and that is worth another star alone."
4,Pleasant Discussion on the Different Aspects of Hallowe'en,"I've never been much of a Hallowe'en lover, but I did enjoy this look at the different cultural aspects of the holiday, from the origins of the holiday to the haunted house industry, even the look at the John Carpenter movies, which I've never seen and don't intend to. The look at Salem's ""witch industry"" is fascinating. Skal doesn't make any great conclusions or add anything new to the mix, but it's an interesting take on the various ways Hallowe'en has been celebrated--and vilified--over the years."
4,Great Music...OK Visuals,Coldplay is absolutley amazing and puts on a great show. The DVD is great to listen to you favorite songs played by the band live. After going to their recent X&Y Tour concert I was blown away by the visuals (lighting and video) so I was a little disapoint to see this one which didnt have all the bells and wissles. So I cant wait till the have an X&Y tour DVD.
3,Coldplay in Fastmotion !!!,"This Video I thought could have been recorded in higher QualitySome of the songs were using such fast frames it makes your head spin, NOT enjoyable to watch.Not a total poor video but could of been better !! Such a Great BandRich"
4,Production... not a show,"First of all... I really enjoyed this dvd. The special features, tour diary, and the actual show.. GREAT stuff!! I think they mixed the arrangement of the songs up enough to warrant buying this dvd/cd. The video quality is AMAZING and the different really give a great watching and listening experience. Unfortunately.. it's a bit too post-produced. Espescially apparent on the first line of ""Yellow,"" there's a vocal overdub which makes me wonder how ""live"" this show really is. Some other parts make me wonder what's live and what's not, for example many of the sounds straight from the album, like the swell sound on the verses of ""Rush of Blood to the Head"" and strings on Politik and others.So... yes buy this dvd/cd, it's GREAT entertainment. I Just wish we could hear the REAL coldplay live."
4,A Virtual Concert In Your Living Room.....and it's in 5.1,"Coming from a guy who couldn't stand this band a few years back, I now Love the ambient beauty of Rock that Coldplay brings to the stage. If you haven't heard a lot of their older hits, then this albumn has everything to offer. The way each track runs into the next, and being mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, It can't be replicated from a simple mp3 download. There's even a few multi-angle options you can choose on a few of the tracks on DVD. I realy hope more labels start producing these DVD/CDs. Maybe then I'll stop downloading and do more purchasing."
1,Does Not Work in a DVD Player,"I bought this and when I got it, I found it would only work in my computer, I tried different dvd players and it was not supported."
5,Excellent Company,The shipper e-mailed me with details that I questioned about the product. The item was as described and a fair price.
3,Faithfully,"I love Marianne Faithfull's autobiography, 'Faithfull', and if it were a movie, this would be the soundtrack. Marianne Faithfull has a beautiful voice in 'As Tears Go By' which is my favorite class rock song of all time. It's sweet, it's warm, and it was also sung by the Stones. I like the songs, 'Broken English', 'Guilt,' and 'Why'd Ya Do It', but I didn't like they way they were on this album. I liked them a lot better on 'Blazing Away'. Like 'Blazing Away', I don't own this one. I borrowed it. This is a good album, but you would probably like the book better. I know I did!"
5,Choices not Fate are the Ultimate Drivers of Destiny,"There are circumstances and a reality that we must face and accept, and then choose what to do with the cards we are dealt. This is a book about influences and what they are and what strategies we can use to navigate. While the debate as to whether astrology is fact or fiction is not in question ... but how to perhaps view the ancient practice, this is a book that is very helpful for those who need to knock some common sense into fatalistic friends predicting dire planetary meddling into their lives."
4,very dense finished product,"I have purchased this item 3 times and have had positive results each time. Though the finished product is very dense and not as sweet as the traditional Jiffy Corn Muffin, if you have gluten intolerance, you will find this to be an adequate replacement. It does offer lactose free directions (a common condition for those recently diagnosed with celiac)which is my usual prep method. The only drawback of the lactose free version is the oil tends to separate from the batter as it bakes, but does not effect the overall quality of the finished product. Leftovers should be refrigerated, and reheated in the microwave for best taste."
5,Long live taffy-pulling!,"I've heard a fair number of Tchaikovsy Fifths (Monteux, Karajan, Jansons, Ormandy, Temirkanov, Markevitch, Rostropovich, and Muti/Philharmonia). For me, this joins Monteux's at the head of the list. The ""taffy-pulling"" that some listeners find objectionable in this performance are the life and breath of Tchaikovsky, and Muti does it better than most. If metronomic Tchaikovsky appeals to you (why?), try Ormandy or Jansons. This is a beauty, expertly paced, warm and romantic without bathos, and the price is embarassingly low-what are you waiting for?"
4,Good Light,I put this on railed .45 ACP Sig P250 full size. Long fingers help me reach switch as I can't get it in a closer groove without light hitting trigger guard. That close but no cigar. Overall good light. I put a 100 rds through gun on range with light and no issues. Solid mount and solid light.
1,WE ARE PENN STATE!,"Penn State has the most beautiful campus, revered professors, and formidable sports teams in this country. It is an institution I am proud to be associated with.Mr. Finebaum needs to find more productive ways to express his anger. Therapy, maybe?WE ARE PENN STATE!"
1,Please..go to pitt,"Why was this book even written. I think that it was a waste of good trees, and well that is about all that I have to say. I was just wondering, did the author get rejected at Penn State?"
2,Very out of date,"I bought this product thinking it was about modern jets. It was from the late '80s or early '90s, so I feel it was a misrepresentation. It is well-done for that era, but not modern fighter jets."
4,This was intresting:-),"The Tell Tale of Heart by Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a mad man who killed someone, Eventually tells on himself. This man is known to be crazy. Every night he goes in a room and watches the man with the evil eye. Until one night he decides to kill him. The mad man thinks the evil eye is after him. This book would be of interest to middle school level to adults. I loved his vivid details and use of vocabulary. This story is one of many stories I loved of Edgar Allen Poe. His twisted mind makes many of his works enjoyable. I recommend this book to many people."
2,I don't like this book,"This book is a kind of psychological review. I think this book is not good for ""healthy"" people. All the facts in the story are telling and showing the mental problems that the main character has. The young man always says ""I 'm not a mad man"", but actually he is telling us that he is. The young man can't just kill the old man because of his old eyes. It misleads readers to have those horrible thoughts with the main character in the story. If the main character thinks that he is right, then he must have mental problems. If the narrator agrees with the ""young man"", then he also has some problem. And if someone thinks that it is a great story, then I suggest you go to see a psychologist."
1,Am police and religons expert: it is inaccurate.,"Having served as expert witness in comparative religions, and in pyschology, as associate professor at a state college, and as police officer, my opinion of this book is it is not worth reading twice. It is highly inaccurate and biased. It overlooks the proven cases of criminal satanic practice, such as Matamoros Mex, (Palo Maiombre). It agrues from silence. It is just an attempt to make a buck by telling people what they want to hear, religios crimes do not exist, or at least are not a serious threat. Too bad he does not know what he is talking aboiut"
2,not My kind of writing,I do not care for this author after reading a couple of her books.My favorite author is Gene Stratton Porter ESP Her bookkeeper of the bees
5,The perfect hedge trimmer,"This is a great tool for trimming hedges, shrubs or whatever. The handles give you distance so you can trim areas that are otherwise inconvenient. Sharp, precise cuts make pruning fun...almost."
1,Who stole the soul?,"The Make-up are lame; if you want soul music then buy a James Carr record. If you want gospel, then buy a Staple Singers record; if you want rock n' roll then buy the Pretty Things or the Monks, or hell even the Minutemen or the Big Boys.But this kind of tripe, man, this junk is for boys and girls who spend too much time in the mirror and read the back of the book instead of finishing the story...totally lame."
5,Marvelous!,Where did this author come from?! Each read was hard to put down. Who would have thought that historical information could be writen to be so captivating. A must have!
5,Best of his Best,Jerry Lee is the number one country and western guy EVER. I reserved that designation for Hank Sr until I got this CD.
4,Don't give up on ol' Jerry Lee!,"Hey, no question, the man has played his ""Killer"" rock 'n roll shtick into the ground, but the real deal is that Jerry Lee Lewis at one time could sing the bejeezus out of several damn good country songs. This collection is only partly representative of his C & W best, but what's here is primo. ""What Made Milwaukee Famous,"" ""She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye"" and ""Think About it, Darlin'"" are as good a set of ballad performances as he's ever given; ""Pee Wee's Place"" and his hi-tooled barrel through ""Me and Bobby McGee"" are Jerry Lee honky-tonk classics; and his empathy with that poor ""Middle Age Crazy tryin' to prove he still can"" is really hard to miss. Great rock 'n roller, to be sure, but Jerry Lee Lewis is probably an even better country singer and this collection goes a long way towards proving it."
5,Enjoyably challenging taste-builder,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. If I'd known about this book during the years I spent teaching poetry to college freshmen, I'd have adopted some of Zukofsky's gut-level approach. Throw away your preconceptions indeed! Zukofsky encourages you - no, forces you - to decide for yourself what's great, what's good, and what's not so hot. And why. It is beneficially disorienting to see poems whose titles, authors, and dates are identified only in the index: there's no subtle pressure to like or dislike. Except for Z's limited, lucid commentary, you're on your own!Zukofsky's ""test"" is not whether poems live up to some arbitrary set of standards of excellence; it's whether they speak to the reader and how the reader subjectively explains how they do it.The poems are well selected. Most are unfamiliar, and a few are tough going. Every time I look into this book I find something challenging and new."
1,take my life,"Hi thereI just have a question.Is it possible to get a playback-disc of the album ""Best so far""from Cindy Morgan?If yes can I order it at Amazon?Thanks for your helpGreetings Pascale"
1,Don't waste your money,This book is just a generic dog book with very little information on the Aussie.
3,Sound Experiment,"On Mr. Happy Go Lucky, John Mellencamp teams up with producer Junior Vasquez for the most interesting sounding album of his career. By employing Mr. Vasquez, the songs have a hip-hop flavor and a dance floor beat. The album has a sonic resonance that adds a fuller sound to the songs. In that respect, the experiment works. The problem with the album is that the songs aren't up to Mr. Mellencamp's usual standards. There are a few excellent songs like ""Just Another Day"", ""Jerry"", ""Jackamo Road"" and ""The Full Catastrophe"". The rest of the songs are well produced, but they sound like he is more interested in the new sound than the songs themselves. It would be an interesting experiment to have Mr. Mellencamp release an album of his older songs remixed by Mr. Vasquez."

2,A bitter disappointment,"This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted. Like another reviewer here said, the only worthwhile songs on this album are ""Key West Intermezzo"" and ""Just Another Day,"" and even they are nothing compared to JM's other work.If you are not that familiar with Mellencamp, do yourself a favor and get an album like Big Daddy or The Lonesome Jubilee to see what greatness he's capable of. I wasted my money on this sorry collection of third-rate material."
3,Silent cop and a bumbling bee,"An old time cop with drinking problem (Willis) and small time thief (Moss Def) on his way to change his life for the better are paired together on their way to the court house. Before long, it becomes apparent that someone has interest in seeing this witness dead. It gets even better when the people in question are no one else by NYC cops. So the battle starts where the old cop tries to redeem himself for his old sins by saving the life of the doomed witness. All the usual cop movie scenerio: fist fights, shootings, carjacking, hostages. My video had original and alternate ending. I choose to watch theatre version that has all Hollywood style plot and of course, the ending too. Fine for entertainment value, but otherwise do not expect too much."
3,"Great movie, annoying character","This is a great movie and I would have given it 4.5 stars had it not been for the annoying voice of Mos Def. He ruined his character and the movie with his nasaly voice. If stuff like that doesn't bother you watch this movie, it has a great plot."
4,worth seeing,"By genre a thriller, but not the ""larger than life"" Die Hard sort we usually see Bruce Willis in. While the story of bad cops chasing a witness that can cost them their careers and their freedom unfolds, and the black guy just doesnt shut his mouth (and while we notice the ""change in his ways"" mainly thru his monologues, at times he is arrgh so annoying! but good!), characters like ambulance car driver (Karl) and main character's sister give the whole movie an air of ""real life, real people"", certain warmth that separates this film from ""Die Hard"" sort, inspite of all the guns fired. Makes sense? Film is worth seeing. Not perfect, but at the end of the movie I actually CARED about the main characters. And that is important, no?"
1,Bruce Has Left the Building,"Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Bruce Willis' movies but 16 Blocks has got to be one of the most boring, mindless movies I have ever watched in a long time. I purchased this Blu-ray because I was expecting a decent movie. But, sheesh, this is one of the worst movies I have ever purchased. Mos Def kept talking on and on so much that he simply got on my last nerve.Richard Donner is an amazing director but he should have stayed away from this particular movie."
3,Fairly disappointing for me,"I had heard this was a pretty good little action flick. Like others here, I did find the acting pretty good and the story, though full of cliches, moved along at a nice pace. What was my problem with the movie? It was filled with absolutely preposterous scenes---i.e., a building is SURROUNDED by cops and Bruce Willis and Mos Def find some kind of way out of there. This happened several times in the movie, each time more unbelievable than the last. I'm actually pretty good at suspending disbelief during movies but this one lost me about half way through. The ending was well-done, although this movie was front-loaded on action---the first half features numerous shootouts, and then all of a sudden, halfway through, the movie becomes more thoughtful and cerebral. I just couldn't buy this one in the end."
2,"""Weird"" does not mean ""interesting""","I couldn't help but compare this movie to ""My One and Only"", George Hamilton's autobiographical movie about his adolescence. Both are stories of growing up weird, with mothers who are neurotic, to say the least.Unfortunately, having colorful characters does not a movie make. I think actually watching someone run with scissors would be more interesting than this movie.Critics have recommended Annette Bening for her tour de force--but a much better example is in the overlooked ""Julia"". Now there's something worth watching.To me, the problem is one of simple unpleasantness. (It's common in movies today that there's no real protagonist--no one to really sympathize with or care about at all.) About 40 minutes into this movie, I was hoping they'd all get carried off in straitjackets. Sadly, that does not happen.I suppose if you've had a really boring, empty life, you might find a story like this engaging. Too bad."
3,Eh....it was so-so.,"I really wanted to like this movie as I thought the book was brilliant! Where the book has you laughing out loud, the movie has you scratching your head. I can sort of understand that though, because it's difficult to capture some of the nuances in books and translate them to movies.There are a few bright spots in the movie though - the cast did a great job, primarily Cross & Clayburgh. It wasn't the acting that left me with a void feeling, it was the flow of the movie itself...very disjointed.The soundtrack on the other hand, was great! If you're a child of the 70s, the music in this movie will definitely bring back memories!"
3,Great movie,"A real thought provoking, dramatic, yet hilariousFlick. Worth a watch. Love that it is a true story toldThrough the words of the writer of the book."
3,Did any of you read the book?!?,"Well, last night I rented and watched ""Running With Scissors"". I read the book and thought that the show would be good, but was sadly disappointed. I was so disappointed that if I were to have watched the show without having read the book, I wouldn't have wanted to read the book. It just totally sucked! It's truly sad because this guy's life was crazy and his writing is spectacular! I'm surprised he thought the show was a good enough depictation. Maybe he thought it was ok due to the fact that it's at least a little touch of his story being told to the world through screen. Who knows. Anyway, buy the book instead of watching the show. You will love the book."
1,disapointment,"I watched this movied after reading the book and the movie was a horrible disapointment. the book was amazing and a great read, i was looking forward to watching the movie. the movie was such a let down. it left out most of the book and i am not sure how someone could follow the movie if they havent read the book. this is definitly a book that shouldnt have been made into a movie"
4,Dysfunctional family at it's best,"This family that the movie is about is so outlandishly dysfunctional it is funny. It is a movie of poor choices and where they lead one in life. It is also a story of a ""therapist/psychiatrist"" and his greed for money. It is also a story of very ""twisted"" lives of those people around the family and ""therapist/psychiatrist"". This movie takes dysfunctionality to the extreme. Watching this movie I found alot of parts of the movie very funny to watch and I was also sympathetic to those characters involved in the ""big picture"". I think it is one of those movies you are either going to ""love or hate"". I highly recommend this movie for anyone that thinks that they have a dysfunctional family. Maybe after watching it, you won't think that way after all."
3,Nothing to write home about,"I mildly enjoyed this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it. It'snot really a comedy or a drama... it's largely just ridiculousin many parts. It's not a comedy b/c too much is just emotionallysick or cruel. It's not a drama because of the absurd aspects.The cast is outstanding and did great work, however the scriptjust wasn't there. The movie is also a good 20-25 minutes too longas well."
2,SO NOT THE BOOK!!!,"If you've read the book, this movie adaptation will disappoint you. It barely resembles the book and really cheats the Borroughs fan who views it expecting the story in dramatization form. The movie gives little of the background circumstances that lead to the events of the premise. The story is oddly weighted to generically display a cast of characters in farce with none of the underlying sadness that the book had to propel the reader through. The characters are simply quirky and odd, not three dimensional and believable. The character of Augusten is played by an actor too old for the story and his naivete is absurd because of it. The sexual awakening in frightening and odd circumstances is watered down in the few minutes that it is even presented in this lackluster flop. Such a ridiculous rendering of what is a funny, sad, and provocative story. Take your scissors and run far far away from this movie!"
1,VERY disappointing!,"I read Running with Scissors recently and was highly anticipating the film adaptation -- I was VERY disappointed in this poorly contructed rendering of Burroughs' book. The film entirely lacks Burroughs' dark wit -- it's as if the director misinterpreted the author's tone. The over-abundant scenes of the characters weeping over their tragic lives left me bored.The movie is certainly well-cast (excluding the roles of Augusten and Nathalie, which bothered me somewhat), but even Gwenyth Paltrow seemed to lack direction in her portrayal of Hope, which was as dull and colorless as a block of wood. However, I do have to admit, Annette Benning and Joseph Fiennes' stellar performances did stand out in this otherwise lacking adaptation. I also thought the script was poorly written -- I can understand the necessity for some creative license, but the script strayed too far from the book in my opinion. I think perhaps that's why the film is such a mess."
2,Deffantley not a comedy,"i don't understand on how this is a comedy it's more of a drama. who ever said the funniest movie of the year was trippin'. it's not funny at all on what happens to the main character. i gave it two stars for effort, but it's something i waon't watch again."
5,Great CD,"Whitecross is one great band Hammer & Nail is a great CD. If you like hair metal you will love this what more can I write about this group that other reviewers have already wrote. I hope everyone finds jesus and let him into your heart. Thats why I think this type of music is great young or old, if you like metal, hair or guitar rock you will get the message. God bless and have a great day!!! Remember When the walls tumble down that's when your new life will begin, so please not for me but for you. If your wall is still up and your heart is cold as ice tear down the walls."
1,Couldn't even finish watching it....,"Having seen the Alamo many times (at least 25) I was glad to see it out on DVD. Since am upgrading from VHS, I bought it. Put it in and soon realized that they had put the basic version on the disc. I took it out and haven't touched it since. Keep hoping they will release the good (Director's Cut} Version soon."
2,It's another DVD con,"Such a great movie completely ruined by Warner/MGM issuing a badly cut version of this classic film. Originally running at 196 minutes with Overture and Intermission plus 26 minutes of footage. This full version has already been issued on both VHS and Laserdisc so why do we have to put up with a cut version on DVD. The breaks in narrative ruin the continuity of the movie completely. Ever since this DVD was released I have been hoping for a ""Director's Cut"" but this does not appear to be in the forseeable future. The releas of the new version with Billy Bob Thornton would have been an ideal time for Warner to bring out THE ORIGINAL."
4,The Classic,"Great spectacle for it's day. Bowie, Travis and Crockett together for 13 days of glory. Not the best acting throughout but Richard Windmark, Laurence Harvey and John Wayne make it definitely worth while. Incidenially, Chill Wills won an Oscar for his supporting role."
2,DON'T BUY IT JUST YET!!!,"For all those who have yet to buy this movie, WAIT!!!I know many have criticized the DVD release as it is the shorter, general release and NOT the memorable ""Roadshow"" edition complete with Overture, Intermission, and over 25 minutes of deleted scenes.The film is currently being worked on up in Canade. It is one of the last surviving prints left in existence. Supposedly, it will be released sometime next year on DVD and Blu-Ray. GOOGLE IT!!!In the meantime, add a couple other John Wayne films to your list until the NEW and IMPROVED version arrives."
1,You're in bad shape when the VHS tape is better than the DVD,"Not to belabor the obvious, but what dummy decided to put the short version of this movie out on disc, when the full version is availible on lousy VHS from the same company? Gimme a break!"
2,BEWARE!,"Hey everyone, this VHS copy of John Wayne's ""THE ALAMO"" is listed as 202 minutes, which would be the restored roadshow version. However, after buying it I discoverd it is only the cut 161 minute version of the film!!!!"
3,Pretty good but the ending was disappointing,I am a huge Kay Scarpetta fan but this one was a little disappointing. The story itself wasn't bad and it was nice to see Kay as a real person but the ending was wrapped up to soon. It is like the book went on and then WHAM! in the last three pages it was all over.
1,My 2nd attempt in reading this author,"I can not fathom how this book is on the best-sellers list?! I had read and was disappointed in the Hornet's Nest but thought I would give this one a try. How and why these characters stay together is beyond me? Any interaction between Kay and Marino, or Kay and Lucy or Marino and Lucy or Kay and Agt. Talley etc etc. is simply negative, rude and obnoxious. I don't know why they speak to one another the next day. I certainly had no compassion or concern for any of the characters. The ""twists"" were hardly a ripple in the story line that were simply dropped or so anti-climatic that it became frustrating to continue reading. I would not recommend this book nor will I pick up another Kay Scarpetta, ME ""extraordinaire"" again."
2,This one left me flat,"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and have enjoyed them all. I was so happy to hear about the release of this one, and while the plot kept me interested, I felt the ending was just too flat. I read it and saw the blank following page and was disappointed that she left it where she did. Marino was a terrible character in this edition, and if this were the first Scarpetta book I had read I would wonder why in God's name Kay kept him around. I sincerely hope that the hopelessness that pervaded in this book won't flow into others."
1,A one star in comparison,"I have been a long time reader of Cornwell, having grown up in Richmond, and have to say this was the WORST of the series by far. The ending was tired and quite reminisent of past endings. It has to be hard to be original, but please..."
5,Don't believe everything you read.,"It's always interesting to read the reviews that show up on Amazon. I read most of the reviews of ""Hannibal"", read the book anyway, and then agreed with the masses that the book was a huge disappointment. In this most recent installment from Cornwell, the opposite is true.I have read all of Cornwell's Scarpetta books and this is the best in a long time. The earlier reviewers seemed to grow cold on ""Black Notice"", but after the terrible ending to ""Point of Origin"", this book was great.I like the ""edginess"" of Marino and Lucy, although it is perplexing how Kay and Lucy keep bumping into each others worlds. And if Marino is being asked for by all of these higher power organizations (Interpol, FBI, etc.) why is he still whining in Richmond? And when is one of these going to be made into a movie?This is the best book that Cornwell has written in a long time. Enjoy it!"
1,Goodby Dr. Scarpetta,"I have read quite a few of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels and this is the last one! I have finally realized that Kay is definitely a self-centered ......Anyway, this book really was a disappointment. I think that Ms. Cornwell would be well-served to move on to another character in her writing future, if she is indeed to have one."
1,Dreck.,Kay Scarpetta was self-absorbed and irritating. Lucy was equally self-absorbed and just plain stupid. The serial killer was an overwrought caricature that seemed taken from an Ed Wood movie. Yuck.
1,Take a pass....,"Take a pass on this one. I've only read one other book by P. Cronwell, ""From Potter's Field."" ""Black Notice"" doesn't hold a candle to that one. Cronwell spends two-thirds of the book analyzing Scarpetta and her loss of Benton, and allowing Marino to give everyone a lot of lip. By some very tedious twists and turns, she connects the dots in the last fifty pages. Sending Scarpetta on a trip to Paris was nice, and the INTERPOL idea is pretty good; however, these are used in a quick-and-dirty fashion, sort of thrown into the mix for good measure. An easy read, if you're interested in reading about someone's personal problems. Don't bother if you're interested in reading a murder mystery."
1,"Slice 'em, Dice 'em, Decomposition","The corpse wasn't the only thing decomposing in what is the latest (last?) Scarpetta novel. Improbable, implausible, incoherent and irrational - to start with. Between werewolf disease, Marino's resurrection theory, drug cartels, Loony Little Lucy, weak and bizarre political manuevering, internet body-snatching (and a coroner's office uses AOL, come on!), walk-ons by a Senator and Interpol, and a baffling trip to France on the Concorde, Ms. Cornwell has effectively killed Dr. Scarpetta for this reader, who just assumes this is some sort of mid-life nightmare? Save your $."
1,Distressingly angry and anoying characters,"I bought the book despite the bad reviews I read here on Amazaon. I made a mistake. I thought, how bad could it be? The story line sounded too good to resist. But this book is populated with absolutely the most angry and anoying characters I have ever encountered. To pick just one example, Dr. Scarpetta's side-kick, Marino, is a manic, foul-mouthed police officer who always states the obvious for the benefit of readers who are just skimming. Other than Dr. Scarpetta, none of the other characters in this book had any appeal. I urge you to heed the warnings of the other readers!"
2,Could be better....,"well, as a die-hard kay scarpetta fan, i was thrilled that patricia cornwell came out with another book. one of the best things i can say about this book is that it is not as bad as the last one. i was glad to be reunited with all the characters that i have grown to think of as family, but the quality of the stories has faded since the death in the subway (true fans will know what i mean by that). although i was disappointed in this book, i will be waiting, patiently, for the next one. if you are losing faith in kay scarpetta, try reading books by tess gerriston, tami hoag or jeffrey deaver."
2,Lackluster effort with a trite ending,"This latest book in the Scarpetta series was a big disappointment. Was this a forensic medicine story or the next plotline for Days of Our Lives? Too much emotional baggage and way too little forensics and prodedural, clever details. The plot was plodding, and when it did start to build an interesting political intrigue subplot that would take a brilliant coup for Scarpetta to emerge victorious, the author copped out with a cheap, ridiculous Hollywood ending."
3,A book for Scarpetta fans,"I recently reread the Scarpetta series, after reading this one. I think *Cruel and Unusual* is the best of the lot. While others complain about Scarpetta's emotional depths in BN, I didn't mind that, although I found the book picked up speed in the second half. I've become more aware that Cornwell can be a sloppy writer - introducing references that are erroneous intrinsically or make no sense, and this has been more marked as the series progressed. Black Notice is more tightly written than previous works. I would like to see a shift in protagonist from Kay to Lucy, as an interesting evoluton in this series. Cornwell still has the gift of smooth writing"
1,Not good.,"The ""crime"" got lost in all the ""psycho-babble"" about Kay's dead lover, her crazy (for lack of a better word) police friend and her gay niece. It was, ""Oh, by the way, we did catch the killer"". Her techinical writing is great and I enjoyed her first three or four books very much.Patricia, please go back to your previous style."
3,Uneven but still engagin,"Like other reviewers, I thought Cornwall spent too much time dwelling on Kay, Marino and Lucy's grief over Benton's death which seems to have made Kay much harder and given to some rather vulgar language that I don't recall her using in other books. The serial killer story and Marino and Kay's conflicts with the new deputy police chief were as fascinating as other Scarpetta novels, and I wish more time had been devoted to that aspect. I hope Cornwall's next Scarpetta book is more up to par with her others."
3,Not her best... but better than lately!,"Patricia Cornwell's Black Notice is a fast-paced thriller for all but the last two chapters... then she ends the book very much like her last two books -- very neatly and VERY quickly. I don't understand what the rush is to have the book conclude so quickly and what about some imagination in the ending, please! Other than the last two chapters, this is vintage Scarpetta -- lots of forensic medicine that makes you feel like you're in the autopsy suite with her, lots of scares and of course, lots of lip from Marino! This book is much stronger than her last one, Point of Origin, which made Scarpetta into a WonderWoman(is there anything that she CAN'T do?!?!) One other criticism is that Lucy is becoming a wacko and in some serious need of psychotherapy before she shoots everyone!"
1,Disappointing. Book should be reclassified as a psych drama,"I used to be able to read a Scarpetta book at least twice. Now I have trouble getting through the first read. I guess the author isn't the only one who has lost interest in the series. I'm tired of outlandish and cartoonish killers and I wish Cornwell would learn how to write endings. It's all so old. Kay's mates are killed off, Lucy is nuts and miserable and gun-happy, but always in loving relationships. Kay is always the killer's target. People are always out to get her. There are always a number of amazing coincidences to tie things together in a hasty knot that passes for plot. I'd like more crime and much less of Kay's messy, uncontrolled inner life. Now THAT is a frightening place and I don't want more than glimpses. I don't want to know how unhinged Kay is becoming. I thought I was buying a CRIME novel."
2,hmm..who's going next?,"While I have really enjoyed the first 3 books of the series, I find myself asking with each subsequent book,""Who the heck will Cornwell kill off next?"" Maybe that annoying absentee mother of Lucy's, maybe Kay's long lost uncle, maybe Marino's hairdresser. Patricia! Listen up! You stretch our disbelief to the breaking point with all of these deaths. Mark gets blown up, Benton loses face (groan) and a friend of Kay's is shot mistakenly after her sister is claimed for a serial killer's victim in an earlier book. Other than my overall objections to the series' determination to kill off everyone Kay loves, Black Notice was a fine book. But it didn't scare me like Post-Mortem or engross me like Hannibal. And the prose sometimes gets so dense I feel like I'm launching myself into a brick wall by catapault and sliding right down. I just can't fall into the book in the techical parts."
3,What happened to the Cornwell I used to read?,I love Kay Scarpetta and can never wait for her character to have another book. But lately I have been alittle disappointed with Cornwell's writing. This book is supposed to take you across the Atlantic to France where Kay uncovers some hidden truths. The only problem is that she waits until the 25th chapter to start the story the veiwers are anticipating. And then she wraps it up too quickly. Cornwell includes other stories that should be included in the book synopsies but aren't. She is almost starting to read like a cookie cutter author when it comes to Kay Scarpetta books. There ins't any scary plot twists like there were in her first 3 books.
2,"This novel is way below a ""Patricia Cornwell"" standard.","Although a somewhat exciting read, this is far lacking the previous polished Kay Scarpetta novels. The characters have ended up depressed and miserable, it's time to start writing something uphill. There wasn't a hint of suspense, and I found myself reading more of a soap opera drama starring the key characters in goofy dire straits. The story didn't flow, and i found many instances of descriptions that contradicted what was just a few lines or a page previous. I feel this was sloppy writing by an otherwise excellent author. We dedicated Cornwell fans could go the extra few months for a book release if it meant a tidier, more believable story."
3,Familiar Plot and little depth,"Cornwell has written a page turner. However, while glued to my seat reading the book I could not help but get a sense that I had read so much of it before. Cornwell skims the surface of so many of the characters, she left me desperate for more information on them. The ending was almost predictable and left me desperate to learn more about the prime suspect. I love the Scarpetta series but I think that this book deserves the Black Notice more so than several of the victims in the story."
3,Get Back To Crime Solving,"I have read all of the Scarpetta books and always eagerly await the next one. I hope with Black Notice we are finished with the grieving, bickering and being bitchy. Black Notice was okay but I found myself skipping the parts where these characters were downright mean to each other. For me these characters are becoming unlikeable and out of control. The book was riveting when covering the crime material but the verbal abuse these people heaped on each other got real old, real fast. Yes these people have lives outside the crime labs but those lives have become the all consuming focus of the last couple of books. Cornwell needs to get Scarpetta and company back to solving crimes, and maybe lighten up their personalities a bit in the process."
4,Black Notice,"Why does she need that angry, sullen neice in every book? I'm so tired of the Lucy character and that's the only thing that keeps me from giving this book 5 stars. But the police work and the camaraderie between Scarpetta and Marino is wonderful to read. The Wolfman from France story was really scary to read over Halloween."
2,Don't waste your time !,"I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before, and I don't plan on it happening again. Her characters are the most implausible group I have ever encountered. She lumps totally opposite people together and never gives us a single reason why we should believe these people would ever have anything to do with each other. She drags us up and down the narrow streets of her mind splattering us with gore and deceit, but never gives us a reason to feel for these troubled characters. It is seemingly an after thought that she finally creates the main villian in this story. He never actually materializes though, and of course it is next to impossible to believe that he even could exist. All that is bad enough, but suddenly and inexplicably the author tires of the entire charade and ends the story so abrubtly that it took me a few moments to accept the fact that it was finally over, and be grateful that it was. Don't waste your time !"
3,Poor Aunt Kay,"As an avide Scarpetta fan I was thrilled to find out Ms. Cornwell had written another. I truly enjoyed Point of Origin, and each that led up to it, and was eager to find out what was to come next for our characters. Unfortunately, this new one fell a little short on my Scarpetta meter! Just when you think we're going down a new road, with infinite possiblities, the road comes to a dead end. I will not be specific because I don't want to ruin the book for other Scarpetta fans. If you truely are, the book is still worth your time just don't get your hopes up that it will be like the earlier ones. I hope the next one, and please Ms. Cornwell write more, will leave us with more answers rather than questions like this one did. P.S. Lucy needs a serious attitude adjustment - perhaps therapy next time!"
2,Far too much space expended on Kay's personal problems.,"Kay is obsessed with the loss of Benton, acting as if it was just yesterday instead of a year ago, in fact, that pretty well is the main story. Cornwell needs to return to her action packed scenarios of previous titles and shy away from the psychological aspects."
2,Not her best work and perhaps her worst,"Having read all of her books I must write to say how disapointed I was in her latest offering. The subplots are poor, the perp not believeable, and the ending awful. However, her writing about forensic medicine and the world of law enforcement is as good as ever but I think I have read it before. Maybe she has run out of fresh ideas and should take a break instead of tossing her readers a lean meatless bone."
3,Great Build,"This book weaves Dr. Scarpetta's personal life together with her professional career, but lacks the ending that keeps you wanting more. I enjoyed the explanations of all of the medical examinations involved. The mystery unfolds well and the side tracks to her niece do not bother the overall flow. Yet, I was overwhelmed by a poor ending."
3,Better than last book but not as good as initial Scarpetta.,"This story is better than the last, but not as good as the initial Scarpetta stories. The good doctor is evidencing increasing paranoia, Lucy is overboard with her anger and Marino needs to shape up and get a woman."
1,Bleckkkkk!,"EEE GADZ! What happened? Anyone speak non-sequitur-ese here? This was an angry novel which depicts Kay Scarpetta as an unhappy, nasty, witch with a B. This patchwork does not work. I am disappointed, I truly love this author and the stock characters. Kay Scarpetta needs a vacay."
2,AOL?,"Cornwell writes light books that are best read ""books on tape"" style. I like them, they are what they are. She seems to know a lot about forensic medicine, but not much else. Only in her books would Smith and Wesson make a seven shot revolver or an educated person (let alone an entire self respecting health department) use AOL. Outside of these little flights of fancy, it's a cool little book."
2,Wonderful book until the ending,"I was extremely disapointed with the ending of this book. I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one was.... oh, I don't know. I enjoyed the book until the end. There was all this talk about the killer and horrible they were... yadda yadda... And then when they do catch him it's like ""Oh well, here he is and don't we feel sorry for him and please don't shoot him"". It just seemed to be a MAJOR letdown. I'm not sure if I plan to read more Scarpetta books or not."
2,just not up to her previous books,"Cornwell's earlier books were much better written than this one. I wish she would go back to the days when her books were based on real crimes committed in VA. Those were her best books. Also, her work needs better editing. There are typos throughout, and somebody from Richmond (i.e., Cornwell) should know how to spell Shockoe (NOT Shockhoe). Plot seemed contrived."
1,Trust me -- Don't waste your time,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books -- paid the hardback price, too! But, I recommend that you do not read this one even if someone gives it to you, free. The book is very disjointed and predictable. Pass this one up -- trust me, don't waste your time."
2,Cornwell needs to push the narrative.,"A few years ago I discovered this series. Mystery mixed with forensic science made for an interesting story. Also you cared about Kay, Pete and Lucy. But something happened to our heroes. Kay became an adulterer. Pete became irrational. Lucy never grew up. And worse, the books started to be more about these characters who I liked less than about the problem to be solved. I just finished Black Notice. I think the whole story could have been told in three chapters and 40 pages. Everything else was personal problems and politics. I love a good mystery. The main characters should be interesting people who you care about but they should always be secondary to the narrative."
1,The Downward Slide Continues,"In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better."
4,I just love Scarpetta!,"While I agree with some of the other reviewers that perhaps this wasn't her best Scarpetta book, I just love Kay Scarpetta! Cornwell draws her so beautifully, and I've become so involved with all the characters that I feel as if I know them personally. Like some of the others, I would prefer that there be some lightening of Kay's attitude, that after all the tragedies she could find a sense of peace in her life somehow, but I must admit this is probably a more realistic portrayal. After Benton, surely there will be another love interest that is worthy of such an intelligent heroine. For me, the mystery and details are always first-rate. Cornwell draws a powerful line in the dirt and dares us to cross."
1,A disappointment,"Ever the optimist, I bought this novel hoping that Cornwell had improved over her last, disappointing Scarpetta stories. Kay has changed for the worse, remaining hysterically out of control during the entire novel; the realism and credibility of this character has disappeared. The secondary plots are distracting to the point that they overshadow the story line, making it incidental and trite. The climax was predictable and silly, and held no enjoyment for me.Scarpetta is overbearing, controlling and convinced of her own, singular wisdom as she seemingly fights against everyone else in law enforcement. Absurd. Lucy's situations are irrational and her character continues to be focused on her lesbianism (sounds like Ellen). I was disappointed- couldn't wait for the book to end.Save your money."
3,I was some what let down at the ending,"What I didn't like was the fact, that IMHO, one of the main persons, in this book was more or less left out...That is, details, as to his thoughts, motives, what made him the was he was...there are IMHO, a vageness, about the 'wolf-man"", that should have been included...If any one has ever read ""THEWATCHER"", by Dean Koontz, will understand what I'm trying to point out...his ""MONSTER"", was given, feelings it expressed, how it felt, why it was angery, in short, he had substance, you couldn't help but ""feel"", for the poor thing...this was missing here....another charector in the book, her motives, were never made clear, either, before she was 'rubbed out', near the books end.....she was nasty, but I never grasped her true motives or reasons for being that way..I think/ believe, more defining, of the story line was needed...I truly felt let down, at the ending.."
3,Not her best,"Patricia seems bored with local Richmond. Although Kay mentions several times there are lots of bodies constantly comming into morgue, she gets possessed with solving 1. Flying her (and drunk Marino) to Europe on Concord seems like Patricia needs recognition by more prominent digitaries. In all, this book confused me since I got distracted many times with these inconsistencies. Kay is best at autopsies and solving complicated deaths local to her terf. That is what captured my very strong interest in prior books."
4,good but not her best,This much awaited edition of the Kay Scarpetta series was a little farfetched but still worth the time & energy to read. I couldn't put it down like all of her other books. The ending was a bit forced and leaves you wishing for a more developed and more plausible ending. Hopefully the characters will all get it together after this novel. They are all still grieving over Benton. It's time to move on. Obviously Kay did! Now it's time for Marino & Lucy to do the same. Hopefully the next book will find the three doing less bickering and more crime fighting!
3,Why not go ahead and pull the trigger,"Reading one of her books gives me the choice to enjoy her style of writing (which is wonderfully rich in prose and descriptive passage) and wanting to reach for Prozac....could her characters get any gloomier? If I were Kay Scarpetta I'd turn the scapel on myself, Lucy should just join the SLA and fat old Marino just collapse from overused arteries....none of them have a good day, a good meal, a juicy relationship ...it's just one miserable moment after another.....come on!! Please!! Let these characters enjoy their life to some degree...each new book is purchased by me wtih the hope that Patricia will turn their lives around and let the characters have some quality of life....I've just about read my last chapter in these lives...it's simply too depressing."
2,Not up to snuff,"Amen to reviewer D. Miller! Disappointing. I can believe that Captain Marino remains emotionally stuck in the mud, but I can't believe the improbable villains, or that the Scarpetta character becomes increasingly emotionally fragile, rather than more mature. This growing immaturity seems the chief driving force of the plot, and just doesn't make sense."
1,Losing a Favorite Series Author,"When the author of a favorite series dies, favorite characters also die, leaving a void that's not easy to fill. But one can always reread the old books and enjoy the stories and the characters again.What has happened to the Kay Scarpetta series is worse than the author ceasing to write. With each recent novel, and especially with Black Notice, the main characters (Kay, Lucy, Marino) have become so loathsome and the plots so unengaging that I can't imagine wanting to revisit the earlier novels. These are unpleasant people and I will not miss them."
4,a damned good read,"this is my first go-round with ms. cornwell, and it won't be my last. i found this to be a real page-turner, and i looked foward to reading it in bed each night. i've read the complaints of those who have read her other books (that this is one of her lesser efforts,) but as an introduction to her work, i found it completely satisfying."
