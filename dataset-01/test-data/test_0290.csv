3,wrong movie,"I misread and inadvertently ordered the wrong movie. I thought I was ordering Naughty Marietta with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Alas, what a disappointment! Of course, the music is wonderful, but the movie is just NOT the same. NO WAY. Why would anybody make a DVD of the Patrice Munsel version and NO DVD of Jeanette MacDonald's version????? I cannot believe. Beyond comprehension.Does anyone know where I can get a DVD of the Jeanette MacDonald/Nelson Eddy Naughty Marietta???? I can't find it anwywhere and can't get anyone to burn a DVD from my VHS copy because of copyright. WHAT A BUMMER!emilyroseland@att.net"
2,READ LE GUIN INSTEAD,"If you want to read about an all-female expedition to Antarctica, read Ursula LeGuin's short story, ""Sur"" -- it's amazing, and much better than this. I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Arthur's first novel, ""Beyond the Mountain"" (about a woman climber), so I tried to read this -- but found it too dense and boring, especially compared to her lyrical ""Beyond the Moutnain."" Again -- Read LeGuin's story instead."
2,Not really useful for game programmers,"The title of this book is its biggest flaw because it appears to cater to game programmers but the techniques described within it are not that useful. It appears that the book is marketed to the game programming community due to its immense size. Anybody interested it this book would be well advised to purchase the siggraph proceedings that it comes from because not only will you learn what this book is about, you will also have a large resource of other techniques that can be used for graphics and animation.Yes, John's technique is interesting and different ... however he does not have a gaming background, has never worked on games, and it is obvious that this book is simply an extension of a research paper. You can find better resources for both AI and game programming elsewhere."
3,A Concise Overview of AI for Computers,"The field of ""artificial intelligence"" is so broad, that even confining it to the domain of computer games doesn't help matters much. This book is not a cookbook on ""how to write my monster code"", but instead covers more of the general theory of behaviors and intelligence.I don't have a background in AI coding, so I'm not familiar with the standard AI texts another reviewer points to. Where this book excelled for me was its strong overview of AI and its applications. If you're looking for a book to hand you code for your next big game, I would look elsewhere. For a solid understanding of many of the issues of AI, this book worked quite well for me.I only gave it three stars because of its terseness and the lack of direct relevance (read: immediately usable code) for many people. For some, like myself, the book is valuable just for briefly surveying the field, allowing me to explore specific areas in more depth."
3,Memory Keepers Daughter,Eight of us went to New York last year and we bought the book and all read it. For the anniversary of the event I purchased the DVD so we could watch it together! I watched it first and it really was very close to the book! I think the girls will enjoy it! It didn't have the heart of the book but it kept its integrity. I think folks who haven't read the book will also enjoy it!
1,Shameful representation of the book.,"If you've read the book first, don't waste your time watching the movie because you will be sorely disappointed. The director has left out characters from the book and key parts of the story, leaving the movie a mess and hard to follow. I liked the book, but anyone who watches this is certainly not going to be pused to read it. It's the worst case of book to movie I've ever seen!"
5,wonderful book for ages 4-8. flows well for wee readers,PICKY MRS. PICKLE HAS BEEN READ BY EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY AGES RANGING 5-66 AND LOVED BY ALL. IT SHOWS THAT EVEN IF YOUR MIND IS SET ON ONE THING IT CAN BE OPENED TO NEW IDEAS. I RECOMMEND PURCHASE OF THIS BOOK FOR YOUR LIBRARY!!!!!!
3,Too much cooking and gardening,"This is a beautiful book but it lacked something for me. For one thing, there is a lot of gardening and recipes - I skip these sections in magazines and am not much more interested when they appear in a book. The house is stunning but I would have liked a bit more explanation of how the house developed over 30 years as well as more photos of the interior. At the end, I didn't feel that I knew the house very well. I feel this book is for people who like very cluttered ""money is no object"" decorating with antiques. I much preferred ""Winter House"" by Charlotte Moss."
1,Parts is NOT parts: Buy the real thing,"Can I give this 0 stars (or, as in the old Macworld, a bomb icon!)?I can't believe it. In fact, I didn't believe the other reviewer who said this cartridge was bad. I bought it anyway. Parts is parts, right?Wrong.The print quality was *in no way similar* to the Epson cartridges. Even after numerous nozzle purges, ink splattered all over the page, there were veritcal discolored lines in the photos.Worst of all, it didn't quite fit properly. When I tried to remove it (following the instructions in the Epson manual meticulously) the Dataproducts cartridge got jammed in the cartridge housing (actually stuck onto the ""spikes"" the open the ink wells... my guess is the covering is not quite the same thickness as the original model) and so the cartridge cover (the purple plastic lid over the cartridge) wouldn't pop up. It took two printer techs almost an hour to extract it, and we were contantly in fear of ruining the printer."
2,Woman's Dictionary of symbols and sacred objects,"a fun reference but production quality low, definitely not a treasured addition to my library"
2,Possibly not the true facts...,"The author takes her same personal approach. Leaving one to wonder the ""true"" meaning behind her books. She only focuses on Norse and Christian symbols. (Well, Greek too). I've read her other books as well and I'm growing tired of the same underlying negative tone regarding men. However...there is something about her that I like...I'll keep her books and refer back to them at later date. Maybe my feelings will change."
1,"So Much Wishful Thinking, and Half-Baked Scholarship","I cannot recommend this book to anyone. From my perspective, it is an example of the kind of wishful thinking that passed for scholarly writing on feminist spirituality in the 1980s.The book does not seem adequately sourced, and some of the alleged connections Walker writes about seem conjured up out of whole cloth. Her bibliography is unimpressive, too.This is the kind of writing that gives women's spirituality a bad name. And what distresses me the most is that Walker's material is picked up and regurgitated over and over again in so many subsequent books in this subject area. Too many naive readers take everything in this book as gospel truth, simply because Walker has said it is so. And they are using this as a primary source!At core, this book is embarrassing to me. I do hope some 3rd-wave feminist with scholarly credentials and training comes along to write a badly-needed better version."
5,Great Witness,"Enjoyed greatly would recommend to all to read. Whether a believer or not, this is real. We need to be aware of the moving of the Spirit and its healing power."
5,Great lessons in a short book,"As a dog lover, this book really hit the mark. It was short, entertaining, emotional, and provided life lessons (or reminders) to help each reader become a better person. I really enjoyed the story - I laughed and cried. A must read for dog lovers - particularly those strapped for time and tapped for patience."
4,No carrying case,"Received my reconditioned Skil Recip saw. Works great. My order was for a model with a feature for changing blades without tools. The one I received requires a tool, included. It is very litle trouble, but I made my choice on the basis of the feature. Also received no carrying case, as advertised.I have purchased several reconditioned tools from Amazon, and have been very pleased with the tools and the prompt order fill and delivery."
2,So bad it's.... yeah.... bad,"Let me start off by saying that from time to time I do enjoy a film that is light on plot and heavy on action and style. This film got the weak plot aspect taken care of and it DOES have a TON of action... but too much over the top action to even make it enjoyable for me (and i liked the first Transporter!). I wanted to enjoy this, i really did. I love Clive and Paul but they couldn't save this for me. The jokes and one liners were eye rollers and the action just too outrageous. I understand the concept but feel it was poorly executed. Come to think of it, i was rolling my eyes during all the action sequences too at how ridiculous it was. Some people enjoy that... i guess this time i'm not one of them."
4,One of the best action movies of the year = 4.5 stars,"I can't say it any better than what's already been said. I'll just add that this movie is a real HOOT. However, I must refute those who say it doesn't have a plot, cuz it surly does. It's as unbelievable as must of the stunts, but it's there if you can see it through the non-stop action. I may not have it exact right; it's been a few weeks since I saw this film, but... (SPOILER) It's basically about the last surviving baby from a baby mill whose existence is solely to serve as transplant material to save a wealth and (soon to be) powerful politician. Then there's the evil gun manufacturer and his hired guns (Giamatti & Co.) who are trying to see that this doesn't happen because of the politician's gun control policy. And poor Clive is caught in the middle with the smoking hot wet-nurse/prostitute (Bellucci). Luckily, Owen pretty good with guns and lethal vegetables."
3,Shoot em up-not my type of movie,"I rented this DVD as an action film in the mold of the ""Die Hard"" series or any Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis film.This is not that type of movie.Like other reviewers have said, this is an NC-17 non-animated take on Bugs Bunny. It is more reminiscent of Quentin Taretino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"". You may like this if this is your type of movie.I really wanted to like this movie as it had three of my favorite actors: Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Stephen McHattie. These three actors helped the movie to 3 stars."
4,Will there be a Shoot 'Em Up II?,"To answer the title question, WHY? This is a film to watch with tongue firmly in cheek, just for the romp and black Humor. It imitates film noir but only for fun."
3,And thanks to Clive Owen...,"All in all, a fun movie to watch. An action movie that ends up falling into blatant hilarity in many a place. The only downside that I could find is that the directors insisted on injecting seriousness where it was not needed. People should have seen this movie for what it was - a glorified Hott Fuzz with a better star (Clive Owen)."
2,Shooting Blanks,"If this is supposed to be a homage to the Hong Kong action genre then John Woo should feel a little slighted. This flick is of little discernible style and no substance. The over-the-top action is boring, the plot is convoluted, and the constant stabs at humor drop like a thud. The usually dependable Clive Owen cannot even save this turkey. He has to work overtime to stave off embarrassment. But, then, Clive can pick and choose his own projects so you can't imagine what drew him to this one. Paul Giamatti lays an egg as the film's heavy. Be careful, Paul, or people will forget that you made good flicks like ""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways"". Monica Bellucci as the requisite femme fatale is the only performer here to make a visceral impact. The hilarious love-making scene between her and Owen is about the only time this film engaged me. Otherwise, this flick is a complete waste of brain cells and not in the good way that some popcorn flicks are."
4,Spend money on this one!,"this one blew me away! aside from Clive being smokin hot, i truly loved this and watch it over and over. it isn't much on the story line. it's short and to the point. you fully understand what's going on throughout the whole film for sure. the action is all shooting and escaping and will truly take your breath away. the sex scene was hilarious. he doesn't want to care...but gets trapped into it every time. look out jason statham you got competition on the hot scale!"
1,Why did Clive Owen do this....??!!!!,"I can't believe those stars including Clive Owen thought it was a good thing to do this movie. Money is money I guess. I read critics' reviews that it was in the genre of Sin City but it was terrible. ""Over the top"" garbage. The whole movie was just done bad. All the shootout scenes were so mindlessly dumb that I lost interest fast. All the dialogue tries to be cool but it is hopeless. There are good shootout scenes like The Matrix and Heat and then there's this D-class junk. This is a prime example of trying too hard and coming up with a mess instead of an ""over the top"" action flick that's smart and entertains."
4,Awesome action movie!,"This movie was awesome. Constant nonstop action. Very good!! Rented it, loved it and had to have it for my collection. Could watch it over and over again."
3,Have your cake and eat it too,"This movie likes to have its cake and eat it too:- the anti-gun political message- along with a celebration of guns and gun violence.I have noticed this trend in Hollywood. You see it in movies like the Bourne Identity, where 80 minutes of violence and revelling in violence is then followed up by 10 minutes of political ""message"". After all, Hollywood wants to make money at the end of the day (and also have a ""clean conscience""). This strategy allows both things to occur: they make money, but then justify it by saying. ""oh, it was all really against guns""."
2,know what I hate...,"I'm a lil' late to the party, this film is a few yrs old now.....Ok, I like action movies & gun fights as much as the next guy... just not when its so incredibly over the top & ridiculous as this film is. They don't even try to make it believable. I'll pass on the old milk maid ho too. Sorry, 2 stars for me."
1,"So bad, it's bad","If I want to watch a John Woo movie, I'll watch a John Woo movie. This is just a bad, childish ripoff."
3,only for monica bellucci,Other than the absolutely stunning and underutilized Monica Bellucci this movie is not worth seeing at all.Bad action movie.An okay love scene.3 stars for giving a role to Monica Bellucci Only.
1,THIS movie is Ridiculous!,I watched this movie the other day with my friends and it feels like some very bad video game where one guy is invincible. The plot makes no sense and the blood and gore is overdone. It is basically about some British Agent that kills around 500 people by the end of the movie mainly by a Magnum. Too much sexual stuff; definitely not for under 17. Don't waste your time.
2,"A typical ""gunfest"" with a lame story","As I watched this film, it seems like nearly every three and a half minutes, I was saying ""Jeez, was that stupid."" It's just another one of those kinds of films where the protagonist is sought and shot at, but never catches a bullet. The main hero of the film will have 50 (said to be) professional killers shooting at him, and yet they always miss, even at close range.The only reason why I rented this film was because I like to see Monica Bellucci films, but even she couldn't save this ridiculous ""tongue in cheek"" shoot `em up. I am sure glad that I watched this one alone. I'd be embarrassed to have anyone think that this kind of movie entertains me."
1,Simply awful.,"I bought this loser of a film on Blu-ray and I was totally disappointed. What's with Clive Owen eating a carrot and killing people with it? That's just so stupid! How did this piece of trash get made? Also, it is tremendously vulgar and I mean really pervertedly vulgar. I can't believe the three main actors would even have consented to be in this garbage. Clive Owen, for whom I always enjoyed in films, has been in a couple of really terrible movies. If he keeps it up he won't have much of a career left. I like action movies, but this is just a sick perverted piece of tripe trying to pose as an action movie. Bad, really bad, if I could give it no stars or a negative number I would."
5,Practical stuff.,I found the book to be full of practical advice and I like his emphasis on training children to be considerate of others.
2,Not a product suited for a Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"Everlasting Fun Ball, made by the same company is better suited for bully breeds. This toy, after only one throw/fetch session looks worn and raggedy, with big teeth holes - doesn't look like it could withstand another session."
1,Maxell CD Scratch Repair Kit,I bought 2 of these kits hoping they would work. I have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit. I will continue to search for a product/system that REALLY works.
2,not sure it works,"I followed the instructions but it seemed to make the scratches worse. Of the 20 CDs I tried to salvage, only one has come out safe so far."
5,So nice!,"I bought this after hearing Mr. Cox sing the mysterious and moving ""Quintanaroo"" on YouTube. For a great laugh, listen to ""I Don't Think I'm Coming Back to You."" I think of Mr. Cox as a musical cowboy poet. I love his voice, his humor and his depth of emotion. I highly recommend his CDs."
5,One of Plimpton's best,"This book is excellent for an authentic glimpse into the 1960s NFL. It is also very funny and extremely well written. Alex Karras is an eccentric character who provides a barrel of laughter with his off the wall sense of humor. Plimpton, unkowingly, plays the perfect straight man for karras's bizzare antics.My only complaint about this book is that it was such an enjoyable read, I wish there were many more pages."
5,Great and informative!,I love this cookbook. It is very informative and easy for a novice cook like myself. Gives great information which encourages me to venture out and try new methods/foods. I can hear her voice as I read this. I know it will be a much used guide in my kitchen.
3,Unnecessary if you know how to cook,"This is a great little book for new cooks. For those of us with some experience, it's not worth the money. Buy Mastering the Art of French Cooking instead."
3,Kindle version NOT text-to-speech enabled,"I am one of a gazillion people who loves food AND love to listen to people who talk about food. Therefore, I was excited to see this book, 'Julia's Kitchen Wisdom', available on Kindle. BUT it is NOT text to speech enabled AND all the pictures and drawings are ommitted. SO SAD. ALSO, Kindle did NOT give me the option of returning the book, as it usually does upon delivery.Kindle, give me all of Julia or give me nothing. I will keep this bastardized version of Julia and pay for it with hesitation, waiting for a speech enabled version - grumbling every time I want to listen rather than read (like when I am lying in bed and planning my next family event's cuisine with food avarice), waiting for you to do this book, and all other Julia Child's books to the TOP QUALITY THAT THEY DESERVE."
5,There is a reason this woman's Cook Book is still in print!,"After seeing the new movie about Julia Child (Julie and Julia) I just had to try it for myself and see if I felt as moved by her receipts as so many people have. Moved by a Cook Book's receipts is more than anyone could possibly hope for or even understand until you cook from Julia Child's that is! I have never had Chicken or Beef that I couldn't wait to make again until now. The Master receipts are foundational for so many variations to follow in her book. I will forever be grateful for the Movie, it brought me a Cook Book that has all but replaced my other Cook Books. I love my Vegetables sauted in Butter and my meat cooked in Wine, how divine! Bon Appetit!"
3,Julia's Kitchen Wisdom,"Julia's Kitchen Wisdom - Not sure what I was expecting but found the same information in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"".The book was listed as used however looked brand new to me. Delivery was very timely."
3,Some nice tips,"This is a handy little tip book. I think those who love to cook will enjoy paging through it even though I'm sure that many of the tips are already well-known to those who are creative cooks. However, for people like myself who prefers to cook simple, fast dishes, this book helps us discover how we can make our finished meal a lot more tasty.In short, great cooks may learn a few more magic tricks in gourmet meal preparation and occasional cooks will learn some helpful tips. It's priced right and worth the investment."
3,A sequel for redemption,"Defiantly not the best sequel in the world, at least this time they strive to give Quasimodo a love interest who is actually interested in him back. Quasimodo stops by a traveling circus and falls for the evil magician's assistant, Madellaine. The evil magician, Sarouch, tries to force Madellaine to help him steal Notre Dame's most famous bell. I guess it is a good thing that Quasimodo now has a love interest but I would think that Disney could come up with a better plot line to achieve that goal than the one that they did."
2,Another Disney short coming,"After making such a great movie as the first Hunchback, it is hard to beleive that Disney would try to pass this off as a movie we should rush out to buy. It has a great cast, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Jenifer Love Hewitt, what not, but the songs were too horrid to endure, the animation worse than a Don Bluth flim and some situations contrived. What it did have was a beleivable plot as far as cartoons go, which saved it in many places. And there were places where you could tell that animators spent a bit more time than others. I just thought that who ever directed this film should have watch the first one before doing the second. It gives sequels a bad rap."
1,Disney is hard up for material,"This movie really stunk, especially when compared with the original Hunchback. It was so boring I couldn't get my five year old to stay in the room to watch it, and she's a video watching fanatic. I wish Disney would stop making these lame...really lame....sequels. There's enough good literature out there that they haven't even tapped yet. They care nothing for entertainment anymore, all they care about is making a buck. Well, we rented this one only, (thank heavens!) and that's all the money Disney's getting out of me on this really rotten flick!"
1,horrible!,"do not rent, buy, borrow or anything else this movie. i cant believe disney put their name on this movie. The 1st one was a 4 star, this is a no star movie"
2,Not as bad as I thought but no oscar,This movie is cute as in I don't have the heart to be a harsh critic. Hunchback of Notre Dame II is pretty package and nothing more. I always thought this movie was a bomb. It still is . It's animation is pretty cheap. I'd definitly hire these animators. But no way in heck I'll charge them for stories in which they are sorely lacking as this movie illustrates. Stick to the original or read the novel if you are 18 and older. IN short pretty cheesy.
3,"Not great, but entertaining","I enjoyed it, but it doesn't make much sense unless you've read the book (OK, even then...)The film is loosely based on James Kunin's book of the same name. An undergraduate rower at Columbia University in 1968 feels vaguely sympathetic towards student protesters but remains on the sidelines. He meets a radical girl, falls in love and gets involved. He winds up in a campus sit-in and gets beaten up when the cops clear the building.BOOK WEEK once described Kunen as ""...a soft-core radical - a kind of New-Left Charlie Brown..."" which kind of fits; he was a Gene McCarthy supporter. The movie isn't especially preachy but the final scene doesn't QUITE work as a summing up (not anymore, anyway!)"
4,Great movie!!!,I guess the original soundtrack was not as good as one might expect from movies nowadays. The movie has good quality of video image. A great movie with a profound message!!!
5,My baby just loves it!,"I'm very happy with the purchase, my 4 months old love the gym, he would reach out for the hanging toys and coos at them, the music and the lights keeps him interested, I just let him play with it while he has fun and I can get things done. I would recommended it to every parents."
1,Power supply problems within one week of purchase,"It seemed like a great machine at first, but the power supply broke after several days of use (the machine would not power up AT ALL).I contacted HP tech support and was connected with someone who barely spoke English. After reading from a script for nearly thirty minutes, I was advised to ""take it back to from where you purchased it.""I am horribly disappointed with this purchase.."
3,Hands free Headset mike Audio Technica Pro 8HEcW,"I bought this as a replacement headset for my Audio Technica Freeway 200 Series VHF Wireless mike. The original was fine, but I caught the headset cord on a doorknob and tore the transmitter connector off. It's a Hirose connector and could possibly have been replaced, but it was more straightforward to buy a whole new headset.The hands free headset works well for my application, calling dances. The environment is too noisy for an equivalent inexpensive lapel mike to work well."
1,SENT ME WRONG BOOK,Package arrived on time but it was the wrong book in the series and no one replied to my email >.< I wish these people would of got their act together because i would of really loved to been able to share this book with my son but now i guess i never will.
3,War!!!!!,"This book explores the concept of being able to live through an actual war. Although the concept may seem interesting the book isn't exactly. It is one of those books that you want to read, but then the further along that you get the more you want to stop reading it cause its a little boring, but then you want to finish it because it seems interesting enough."
2,Cinderella II So-So good!,"If Michael Eisner wants to re-introduce Cinderella to future generations he should re-release it, and other original animations, every 10 years in movie theaters to maintain interest. Snow White & the 7 Dwarves was re-released about 10 years ago. I was truly exited to see it in theater even though I owned a vhs copy at the time. So I ask you this question: If Cinderella already lives ""happily ever after"" then why does she need ""dreams come true""? I recommend you rent Cinderella II before buying it. Cinderella II is cute but is not a quality full-length movie like the Beauty and the Beast Christmas sequel."
4,"Great Movie, Different Colors",Great dvd. I like the movie. It is my favorite. The only thing that is wrong is that there are diffrint colors. I mean look at Cinderella'srags they are blue and look under the mice's shoses there is an oval of light brown under there.
3,Cinderella 2,"Although I find this movie to be mildly entertaining, I believe it is not at all like the original movie.This movie was made specifically for children who are at the most, eight years of age. Older children will figure that out not too long after the movie begins.Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True, is about the mice making something, I can't remember what, for Cinderella using memories of things that have happened since Cinderella's marriage. As they work on this project, they remember things such as when the mouse in the red jacket turned human, when one of Cinderella's stepsisters (Who they make surprisingly nice) falls in love, and so forth.I would not recommend this movie unless you are young, and/or like the Disney Princesses Collection."
3,OK,"I have to look at this movie from several points of view. From a childs point of view, this would be a very fenjoyable movie. From an adult's point of view, I am not too sure, though. I got rather bored after the second short film in the movie and will probably not watch the entire movie again voluntarily."
1,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of Disney animation and I must say that some of the sequels have been quite well done. But this is not one of them. This is the absolute worst sequel to date. There is no coherent plot, just three loosley connected stories that seem like they popped out of Saturday morning cartoon fodder. The quality of the animation is average at best, even for direct to video. Only one of the stories is even about Cinderella. The other two concentrate on th mice and step sisters. If disney keeps cranking out these shameless duds they are going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. It pains me to sya all this as I am a big disney fan but Disney has been slipping lately in many ways and this video is one of them."
2,"Cinderella 2 - Rent it, don't buy it","I had ordered Cinderella 2 for my 2 year old daughter who LOVES Cinderella. It was really not worth the money. I thought it was going to be a complete story - but it was several vignettes instead! I did enjoy the vignette about Anastasia (one of the stepsisters) and her ""falling in love"""
1,Disney is Garbage,"Disney should be required by law to change it's name...it's not the same company it used to be. Disney releases one good (by today's standards, I guess) movie every few years and pumps out utter garbage the rest of the time. Does anyone really not see this? If they didn't have their name to keep them in business, they would have died a long time ago."
4,Sooooooooooo Cute!!!!!,"An amazing sequal to Disney's Cinderella. Showing the mice's views of thing that happen in the castle, including run-ins with the cat, they give us another storie to call Happily Ever After!"
1,Uncle Walt wept!,"I wanted to say Jesus wept. this movie is that awful. I'm glad I grew up in the era of good children's/family movies. This movie is made for the TV generation aka I'm bored mommy change the channel. I can't believe Disney made this [junk]. I know not all Disney sequels are bad. Toy Story II and Rescuers Down under, Aladdin and the King of theives are the best Disney Sequels of all time. I cringe every time Disney makes a movie with a II behind it. I pray this mediocrisy doesn't plague Disney's Lilo and Stitch or any other new releases Disney will cook up."
1,zero out of five stars - AVOID,"I am sorry to say I was deeply saddened by my viewing of this ""film"". Its horrible animation and nails-meets-chalkboard soundtrack made me cry tears of horror. Watch the original for quality, watch the sequel to induce vomiting. Spare yourself and your loved ones, avoid avoid avoid."
1,I guess Disney will do anything to make a buck,"They certainly prove that with the release of the horrible Cinderella 11. This movie is so bad, words fail me. I am only consoled by the fact that I watched it at a friend's house and didn't have to waste a dime of my hard earned money on it."
2,Dried My Baby's Skin Out,"I really like California Baby's diaper rash cream; but, have had a very disappointing experience with their body washes and lotions. My boy's have very sensitive skin and this lotion ended up making their skin worse. My 3 1/2 month old has eczema and I think the lotion and body wash made his skin worse. Now I am trying to correct it. It smells great and the lotion is thick; but, it had the opposite effect. Won't buy again!"
3,This book is for disc world fans only.,"If your a fan of the discworld books and you are the type to spend half the night looking through your collection because you forgot the color of magic ""octarine"". this is a must have all the tiny details at your finger tips. The book is laid out like a dictionary or encyclopidia and is current through Hogfather. even if your not a detail fanatic you'll enjoy the extra's in the book like the tour of unseen u and the entry under johnson, bergholt stuttley (bloody stupid) is a scream! all in all a fun book for discworld fans."
3,RE: Looking for Answers,"I am a hich school junior and use the unabridged version of this textbook in my A.P. U.S. History class. Since my school's Advanced Placement courses use college texts, I assume America Past and Present is also used in undergraduate history classes. (I had to rate this book to post this ""review."" Please do not consider my rating if you are trying to assess this book.)"
5,This was bough for a freind!!!,I ordered this for a friend she has trouble with static and ask me about these I told here I know nothing about then and pointed her to a laptop company and they told her about this and It work's great She hasn't had a problem!!! She has been using it andeverything is fine so I would tell any body with this problem to get one!!!!
5,System Builder,"Great product, using on my work bench. This matt performs as advertized and I recomend the product. I intend to purchase a second matt."
4,Great for Cloth Diapering,"Like another reviewer said, it's not a miracle cream and takes a few days, but i've never had any problems with staining my cloth dipes. Also, i don't find the smell offensive - guess that's not a smell i'm sensitive to? All in all, it is the only diaper cream we trust to use on our baby when he needs it. Only wish I could buy 1 tube on Amazon instead of 3 at a time - this stuff lasts so long I don't think I'd need 3."
1,Eardrums are terrible things to waste,"Louie DeVito releases his sixth installment in a dying franchise. What once was a series that hooked curious new listeners into dance/club/techno music and its subculture has devolved into a franchise that unrelentingly pushes out the worst musical garbage that mainstream dance-pop has to offer. NYCUP 6 continues in this tradition, serving up an awful regurgitation of played-out tunes, otherwise forgettable anthems, and just plain bad dance music. The only decent song in this otherwise bland collection would be Insomnia by Faithless, but even that track is over five years old and its novelty has worn off...."
2,Washed Up!,"This Cd is not worth buying, Louie Devito had pumped out what he had in Vol. 4-5 and just fell off. All of these tracks are more like commercial and over played tracks which I've heard months before. BORING!!!! I thought this was underground. On One hand i would like to thank louie for turning me off of this his so called Dance music and turning to the Tribal/House/Electro Genre... check out Ivano Bellini, Oscar G. Surham's Dubai, Azuli's line of Creme Ibiza... You'll get your money's worth. Not this garbage DJ."
2,Losin it...,"Comming from a Dj, I honestly have to say that Devito should have waited for some newer songs to come out before releasing a new CD. This CD did nothing but give people a few goods songs on the first and flashbacks from the second. I have to say one thing though, this is one DJ that is talented and although this wasn't his best, or even close to it, I will still be waiting for his next CD. (if it's not like NYC Underground 6 or Trance Sessions) LoL. If you like Louie Devito, get it. If you like good music, don't."
2,Buy if it's all you know,"I've been a fan of electronic dance music since 1988 when house turned acid and techno was in it's experimental stage. So believe me when I say this CD is not for the discerning underground listener. It lacks staying power, does little for the imagination, and almost all of the songs are commercialized to have a poppy feel. Plus all these songs can be found as singles easily at any record shop. Where are the rare minimal beats that really get the crowd going? Not here.Louie Devito is a DJ that spins re-mixed popular music for the masses, hardly underground as the title suggests. If you want real DJ/Producer skills then check out Blake Baxter, Jeff Mills, Kevin Sauderson, Frankie Bones, DJ Hell, Frankie Knuckles just to name a few. Keep it Underground!"
2,Very Disapointed!,"I love Louie Devito. As soon as I heard NYC Underground 6 was coming out I was the 1st person at the store. I quickly tore the wrapping off the cd case and put it into my cd player. It sucked. The cd is filled with songs that are played out or just not worthy to be played. The only song I have to say is good is #6 I'd say yes. A few others are alright- #5,#7,and if I'm in the mood #1, but really its not worth buying. Techno is falling off!! If knows some good techno cds post up a review and let everyone know because I can't find 1!"
3,Money for CD-Rs?,These colored cd-r's are very cool. they are also verydurable. but I have had a Memorex crw-1622 for sometime now and I havealso been purchasing cd-r's for it for a long time. ... these are good durable cd-rs and will last a very long time even if left in the cd player playing. the color also gets rid of the other bland cd's.
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!!!!!!!!,I hate reading!!! When I saw this book at a school book fair. I Grabbed it! It looked so intresting. When I started to read this I loved it and I didn't want to stop! I could read this 10times and still not want to stop! I am 12 years old and I sill love this book from when I was 10 in the 5th grade!!!!
4,Step & Distance Pedometer,"Works fine, but is hard to keep hooked on waistband. Have lost mine several times. It was easy to set up."
2,Not very reliable,"This seemed very low quality. It would skip steps that I made, and one I got for free in the mail was 10 times better."
1,"Doesn't stay on, not accurate","This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking. Those are the only good things I can say about it. It simply does not stay on. I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it. Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate. I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day. One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300. Which is accurate? Are any of them? I can't rely on it. When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right. Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps. I would not recommend this one."
1,Finders keepers- for now!,"I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today. I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews. When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it! LOLI'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it.:)"
1,Falls off too easily,"Bought this pedometer 3 days ago, and it is going back to the store this evening. It falls off every time I move, and most of the time the fall causes it to break open. As a result, the protective cover no longer sticks."
1,Constantly falls off!!!,"I was very excited to get this pedometer. I took it hiking for my first trial. I got to the end of the trail and checked to see how many steps I had gone. It told me I had only gone 20 steps! I noticed that it was slipping off my belt, so I secured it and continued my hike. Along the course of my day, I had the pedometer actually fall off and hit the ground at least 5 times. I got tired of picking it up and trying to keep it secured. I finally just put it in my pocket and forgot it. The round clip naturally slips. It is very frustrating. It could be a very nice little unit, except for this major flaw. I am taking it back to the store."
2,heard the o jay's sued master p for jacking this,before no limit played out master p would make numerous tributes to his dead brother this became old quick he should have stayed retired.
4,the legend of luke reviewed by twist crack AHHHHH,"This book was about how martin of redwall, prtector, chapion and founder of redwall traveled back to his birth place and found out how his father, luke the worrior sacrificed himself to rid the world of the stoat sea roug captian Vilu Daskar, free the oar slaves and destroy the red ship goreleech."
4,Great book!,"I really liked this book. Trimp the Rover hedgehog goes to Redwall Abbey. It's under construction. She helps build by singing a hauling shanty about Martin's father, Luke. Martin becomes depressed, so Gonff, Dinny, and Trimp take him on an adventure.My favorite part is the song about Saint Ninian's."
5,12th and best,"This book is the 12th and best of the Redwall series! I think so because it (as usual) leaves the reader hanging as he\she turns each page. Also, reading it is not like reading one book but two. And yet, the stories are interwoven. All in all, this is one of the best books I ever read"
1,A book full of errors,This book is not describing the Canon 60D camera! Even the pictures in this book are not of the 60D!For example:1)Page 7 says the 60D uses either type 1 or thicker type ll compact flash cards. It doesnot. It uses secure digital cards!2) Page 9 shows a picture of the card in the camera. Nothing like that on a 60D.3) The main dial of the 60D has a movie mode. But the main dial shown in this book is notfrom a 60D. And the movie mode is not described.4) I could go on as there are many other incorrect things in this book.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!
4,Worth it for Jasper in a Jam alone.,"Before the movies there were the Puppetoons. Everyone who knows LooneyToons, Max Fleischer, and Disney should know George Pal's work as well. 'Jasper in a Jam', 'Tubby the Tuba' and 'John Henry and the Inkeypoo' are classics; the rest has bright spots here and there and is worthwhile if only for the advertising and political history. (Ignore the contrived intro and outro of the movie and focus on Pal's work.)A companion piece: 'The Fantasy Film World of George Pal' covers his movies, including 'The Time Machine', 'War of the Worlds', 'Destination Moon', 'Atlantis', 'Tom Thumb', 'The Brothers Grimm' and 'The Seven Faces of Dr. Loa'."
4,Flavorful bubblel gum!,"This is the best flavor of all the bubblegums I have tried (I'm a bubble gum lover)! Although I have my favorite colors, I TRY not to chew them all first!! Love the packaging also."
2,Very sugary,These are very sugary. The flavor lasts a very short time. The gum becomes rubbery shortly thereafter. I am not a fan of these.
1,This is propaganda,"Thsi is one of the most disgusting books I have ever hard of. What sort of propaganda is this? 'Antichoice clinics?' (Those are pregancy centers that promote life and provide options other than murder.) 'Circumventing parental consent laws?' (That is sidestepping laws which are there to protect girls who have made a mistake and gotten pregnant.) Please remove this book from your list or provide an accurate review, one that reads more like this: ""This book provides a one-sided view of the topic of abortion. It views the act of abortion as birth control, not as murder of a developing child. The best method of birth control is abstinence, which promotes mental, spiritual, and physical health."""
1,Failed to impress musically and dramatically.,"I like Fleming in Mozart and Strauss, but her vocal portrayal of Manon was artificial, mannered, over-worked. She often went off pitch. Her vocal portrayal fell flat (reminding me of Netrebko's equally unsatisfying recent rendition). It felt like she was trying to demonstrate to a student how to sing Manon instead of actually inhabit the character. It felt like ""Oh look at me and see how great I am""! I recommend the Gheorghiu-Alagna CD of this opera instead - an exemplar of style and good taste."
1,You get what you pay for,"Well the price was really good for the 4 pack of Maxell VHS tapes that I purchased but the quality of the recordings after 2 or 3 times was awful. Whatever I recorded- the audio was fine but the picture just kept rolling. If you put the VCR on pause and then hit play it plays ok for a few seconds and then it starts rolling all over again. When I try to rewind the tapes 2 of the 4 tapes stop rewinding and shut the VCR off. When I turn the VCR back on, the tape pops out and I have to go over to the set and push the tape back in and hit rewind again. It takes about 3 or 4 times of doing this to get back to the beginning of the tape. VERY annoying. It's not the VCR as I have tried it in a couple of different machines with the same results. I guess the old saying is true that you get what you pay for. I'll go back to the high grade VHS tapes when I place another order and see if they are any better."
4,Rare Find,"It's gotten so difficult to find VHS anymore and they're expensive when you do. I'm not a big fan of Maxell but these were affordable and about the only choice out there. So far they've recorded well, no problems, just wish they were 8 hours instead of 6."
3,Buyer beware,"I tried to buy this TV from Amazon last Sunday. 2 days after my order and confirmation and a call from my credit card asking if the or was OK, my order was magically canceled with no explanation. I would strongly suggest following every step of the buying process looking for fishy things.Personally it is some kind of bait and switch because I originally went to Amazon through a link for a very low price. If Amazon is going to post incorrect pricing they should be required to meet them just like a brick and morter."
4,Great recording of a great band.,"If you know anything about SACD's. The Mobil Fidelity SACD version of this album is the gold standard. If you can find one they are over $200.00. This version gives a very good rendition. It does not have the width or depth of the SACD version, but it is very good none the less. Highly reccomended."
1,Basically Unusable...,"Got this to split the VGA connection on my TV so that I didn't have to keep swapping cables between my computer & Xbox 360. Unfortunately the screen is unreadable with this cable hooked up. Every screen has multiple shadows, and the colors are all screwy. At least I only spent $.99"
4,hard to put down.,"characters were good, the plot was good and was very enjoyable to read. i would recomend to anyone interested in fiction."
2,"Awful to assemble, not good quality","I'd recommend buying a better quality unit. It was awful to assemble because of the cheap quality of everything. The wood split when the screws were going in, the plugs (to cover the screws) wouldn't stay in the hole u less you forced the screw way down, which split the wood more! The drawers were too tight to move along the rails and had to be removed. It is a flimsy unit and has to be moved very carefully, otherwise it will bend and topple.Buy something else."
4,very retro,"We loved it....was just what we expected...wish the string was longer, but for the sake of safety, it's pretty short"
4,Cute Dog - just like in Toy Story,"I really like the slinky dog. Bought it for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. She enjoys the movie Toy Story and ""Slinky"" is one of her favorite charecters. It is a replica from the 1950's (I beleive) and the only disappointing fact is that with the concern of child safety of present day, the manufactured moved the pull string from its original location and also made the string shorter (to prevent estrangalation). With this being said, it is very difficult to meneuver the toy. Cute toy, but just not functional."
1,SLINKY DOG,"The slinky dog is a waste. As for the other toys, I have not received them yet and have not used the shampoo or the conditioner yet"
4,Great value for Toy Story lovers!,My daughter LOVES the Toy Story movies. I've been slowly collecting toys from the movies as I find good deals on them. The classic toys like Mr. Potato Head and this slinky dog are still found at great prices and help round out the collection.
4,Horray for good music!,"This album is really awesome. It is low key and is extremely relaxing to listen to. If you want music that will make you fall in love all over again, this is one I would recommend. My boyfriend and I already have ""Don't You Remember"" as one of ""our"" songs. Hope you guys enjoy!"
2,not like they used to make em,"Material is the paper thin cheap stuff that you will find on 20 dollar shoes from wallmart. FILA used to use a strong weaved material that would last forever. Not anymore, they went cheap. No more FILA for me."
4,buy it,Great sneaker-it is well built-solid construction -like the thick sole should last a long time-recommend buy 1/2 size larger since they run small-like the all around style
3,Fila Men's Disrupter II sneakers,My right shoe is slightly tighter in length then the left shoe. The soles for being thick are not soft as they look. I have skechers body shapers which are less pricey with a softer sole. I buy shoes not because of advertisementbecause the thickness of sole. I need the cusion for back.
3,Self-Publishing 101,"Linda Radke's practical,money-saving introduction to the self-publishing process will maximize profits and minimize mistakes. From start to finish, it is filled with essential information and scores of useful resources. If you yearn to maintain control over the timing and presentation of your first book, this informative Guide will skillfully introduce you to the secrets of self-publishing success."""
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"Not really as good a book as it ought to be. A bit skimpy on the details really needed to self-publish, and doesn't have much in the way of money-saving tips. Far better (though they cost a few dollars more) are Complete Guide to Self-Publishing by Ross and Self-Publishing Manual by Poynter,"
5,THA BOMB!,Pushin' Inside of you brings back so many memories for my husband and I! And How ya'Do Dat is so tight! I had to have this cd!
4,Really like this vest,"Fits well over winter running gear, when I'm more likely to be running at night. It is a bit short waisted, though. At 5'3"", it is JUST long enough to be at my waist. I have the small/medium size."
3,XL it's not,I'm a large guy and this is sized way to small!I will still use it but without zipping it up and it should work ok.havent tried it in the dark but will soon because I plan to start riding mny bike to work.If your a fit med sized person then get the L/XL and it should fit fine. :-)
5,Great camera all around and dummy-proof as well.,"I went into Target with a $100 limit to buy a new camera, and this one was $99.99. I do not want a digital yet since they need to be expensive to be good, but I have started freelancing for a local magazine and needed something better than a plain old autofocus, non-zoom, autoflash cheapie, which is what I was using with pretty decent results, but that one started malfunctioning. I know most people don't read the instruction booklets that come with cameras, but this one really can do a lot, so it is going to be a waste of your time and money if you don't check out everything that it can do. I recommend using a whole roll of film just trying out the different modes and experimenting. It does everything that a manual 35MM camera can do, but if you're like me and are likely to mess up on your manual settings and ruin a picture, this camera is going to be your best bet. And you can't beat the price. Most cameras at this price only zoom up to around 80MM."
3,A Good General Tape.,"Well, I wouldn't record ""EXODUS'S"" 'Tempo of the Damned' on the Maxell UR. But UR is a good choice for recording music that is not so over the top. For the reasonable price of UR, it is really versatile. As well as not too intense music, it is a good tape for recording from the radio, as well as general voice recordings. A previous reviewer was quite right by pointing out that for high intensity recordings, you are better off with Maxell XL II."
5,"Poignant, insightful, inspiring, and very ""reader friendly"".","Blending wry humor with poignant insight, Bob Welch writes of a man who handed down a grand legacy despite never having a business card, never receiving a promotion, and rarely taking a vacation; a middle-aged woman who dressed in a rally uniform and yelled her heartiest at a Turkey Bowl game, her cheers meaning more to her son as the years went by; a family with 23 children (many adopted) who always have room for one more because they know there's no limit to love. These and other stories in this inspiring, satisfying, engaging collection combine to show the many ways we have of nurturing a legacy that lasts, creating a family of faith where spiritual roots grow deep, and where wisdom, values, and the sensibilities of love are passed as a kind of spiritual legacy from one generation to the next. Highly recommended."
4,"Spanish music it is, the good kind I mean",The reason I did not award this CD 5 stars is the fact that it is not long enough. It is probably a 30 minute CD. It has 2 tracks and each track is a medley of classical Spanish music played by the Madrid Orchestra.
4,Leather Trench Coat,"I purchased this coat as a gift for my son. He loves it. It does have some issues with buttons being loose and some of the stitching not holding, but for the price I paid, it is a very nice leather coat. I checked around to see if there was anything comparable at a little higher price, but could not find anything. I read the reviews and decided that even tho it had some bad reviews, the good reviews outweighed the bad. He is very satisfied with the coat."
2,Much larger than XXXL...more like XXXXXXXL almost unwearable,see above Much larger than XXXL...more like XXXXXXXL almost unwearable. Way oversized. They were none in the XXL rangbe or I would have returned it
2,Trench Coat,"I made this purchse as a gift to my husband. He wore it one night and lost a button then found a tear in the pocket he put his keys. The keys went all the way to the bottom of the coat and it took a while to push them back up and out the pocket hole.When the button came off, it tore a small gash in a cross seam as well.I had to stitch both pokets and stitch up the tear in button area. I will need to look for some new buttons. I then checked all the coat buttons and many of them were very loose so I spent an hour reinfoercing them so no to loose any more.The custiomer service depatment at Crative Products did not want to do anything for me on a return. After I discussed my problem, I was told a $5.00 credit would be refunded for my troubles.I did not expect this coat to be so disappointing and am looking to purchase another coat of better quality for my husband at this time.Susan Wennerstrand"
5,Great frisbee for dogs!,"Love this frisbee, our German Shepherd loves to fetch and catch so this is a great product that is easy on his mouth / teeth. This is his second one as the first got too many holes in it, but only after 6 months of daily hard use. We don't let him play with it unattended though as it is NOT a chew toy and could be destroyed / eaten. It only comes out for fetch / playtime and he goes crazy for it. It also flies great when you throw it!"
5,nearly indestructible,"This is our pit bull's favorite toy and has outlasted every other toy we've ever given him. He seems to love the feel of sinking his teeth into the foam without being able to penetrate it. I wish we had known about this thing when he was teething as a puppy( before he destroyed a vast, costly assortment of other toys, home furnishings and architectural features).The disc is very lightweight and easy to throw. An excellent product for owners with poor frisbee skills and/or arthritis. Ordering 2 more plus a medium sized ball."
4,Great hose for a great price,This is a great poly hose. The only thing that I would have liked to see is quick disconnects installed on either end.
2,Who Would Have Imagined....a Drug-Induced Voice?,"I'm been a long time fan of Whitney and it is sad that this current album wasn't well conceptualized and delivered. This album was produced with little or no thought in the selection of tracks and interpreting the song. Whitney sings like she is rushing to get done with her performance. If you have her first few albums, you can clearly see the talent that could have made any horrible song come to life. But this time around, Whitney tries and fails to deliver. Her rendition seems rushed, deep, hoarsy (and sometimes even raspy) vocals make us wonder why she chose to not to invest on her gifts but squander all her god given talent on drugs and be with a wife beater. Almost like she is headed to a path of personal destruction. Her deteriorating vocals truly mirrors her self destruction, judged from her erratic tv appearences. I am extremely dissapointed with this latest release of hers. What has become of Whitney?"
4,True Greatness Can Never Die,"I really love this Christmas CD. It lets me know that Whitney is still in the game, and she's coming back. She may not sound exactly like she use to, but she still got it. This is the best CD she's came with lately. And if she continues on like this, she will get back to where she use to be. True Greatness Can Never Die.................."
1,well whit's drug demons finaLLY WON THE BATTLE,victory for whatever evil forces was controlling whitney all thjese years and thjis album proves her alleigance to whatever xmas spirits she was talking about hope she met the queen of heaven and earned her horns and demonic wings.
3,Thought it would be much better,I was not very happy with this christmas cd I think I need to find something that she may have done earlier in her career.
3,not what I expected,"I felt like it was a little to sexy for Christmas. I like to sing along to Christmas songs, and I couldn't really do that with these versions. Although, I loved Joy to the World and Who Would Imagine a King (I remember that from the Preacher's Wife CD)."
4,MAGICAL....the wonders of Whitney,"This is a great CD if you listen to it a few times. Absolutely stupdenous.Whitney's voice sounds great. She's gaining back her power and her beauty. Her depth of feeling is unmatchable. No other female singer today can match Whitney's glory.I gave it four stars, because I thought the title song ""One Wish"" was hokey and un-inspired. Whitney deserved a better single than that.But her rendition of COME O EMANUEL is the best vocal performance I have EVER heard from her. Absolutely magical.This is the perfect christmas album. GO WHITNEY!"
5,"Grow Up and face the facts Mariah fans, ""One Wish"" is great","You can write 5000 bad reviews because you are Mariah fans, but it does not erase the fact that Whitney sounds great on this album. I'm sick of Mariah's ""whisper singing"". She sings normal, then she whispers, then normal again. Just sing straight! Whitney may have had troubles, but Mariah is no angel. SO, face the facts and GROW UP! There's room enough for ALL divas. Although some are better than others. :-)"
2,Shocked and Saddened,"I eagerly bought this cd, thinking 'it's about time', but I was sorely disappointed. I will admit that I was a big fan back in the 80's, but my enthusiasm had waned, despite any drama and/or bad publicity in her life, I think she is an exceptional singer and was really excited to hear her Christmas cd. I was, however, shocked and saddened by her voice - oh my god - what has happened to that beautiful instrument? Make no mistake, she still can sing, but it doesn't even sound like the old Whitney, in fact, if I hadn't known it was her, I would have been hard pressed to tell it was."
1,not at all impressed,with the expection of 'o holy night' & 'o come o come emanuel' this is album is an absolute disaster of extreme proportions. whitney is a coke head who lacks the vocal prowless that america once fell in love with.
4,challenging and to the point,"I really enjoyed the challenge and fast pace of this video. The work out is only about 20 min but it never fails to make me sweat. It took me a few times to catch on to all the moves (even though I've been doing Pilates for a few years) and to keep up, but now that I know the sequence, I hardly look at the tv.Some reviews didn't like all the intro's and history...but if you buy the DVD you just go to menu and go right to the workout each time. I have about 8 Pilates DVD's and this is my favorite one!"
4,Gun seems to be fine.,"This was given as a gift, but unfortunately the Tippmann 98 Custom didn't arrive with all it's accessories. It was missing the butt plate. Amazon did send another box but unfortunately that same piece was missing in the second one as well. Amazon did make it right for us and did offer a full refund if we returned it. (We opted for a refund of the cost of a butt plate plus shipping. Be aware of missing parts."
4,What a keyboardist!,"This album really wasn't what I was expecting! I go to New York City blues clubs a lot, and I remember seeing Dona open for Robert Charels at Mondo Cane a couple of years back. What a great keyboardist and performer--she knocked me out then, and she's just as good on her new album. Wanna know how find this lady is? She's the regular keyboardist in Shemeka Copeland's band...enough said!!"
3,broke in 2 months,Works well but broke in a couple of months. I think the vibration prevents nicks but the shave isn't as close as when you turn it off. The battery lasted the few months which amazed me.
4,not bad,I bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product.She personally like the product and really good.
5,The Sun and the Sickle Moon,"Maria Merryweather, her governess and the unfaithful dog, Wiggins, all set off to the home, (Or castle), belonging to Maria's cousin, Sir Benjamin. Maria soon finds out that the castle has a lot more to offer than expected, and she is delighted with her new home. However, Maria has a dangerous task to perform. She must make peace with the desendants of the Merryweather's greatest enemies, a task which should have been completed by Moon Princesses throughout the ages. Now, accompanied by Wrolf, her faithful dog, Wiggins, her not so faithful dog, Perrywinkle, her mighty steed, her hare, Zacheria the cat, and of course, her best friend Robin, Maria will go forth and try to make peace, securing the happines of her people."
3,Too sugary,The first 80 pages are tough to read as they are so sacchrine. It's 80 pages of heavy desciption with Maria falling madly in love with everyone she meets or becoming spellbound by something that is the most something she's never seen (or heard or tasted...) before. Then FINALLY the plot beings and the next 100 or so pages are quite interesting. Sadly the ending goes for the sugary happy endings all around for every character.
4,The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge,"A very nice fantasy fairytale. Ms Goudge descriptive narrative made it feel like you were right there with Maria Merriweather, although I sometimes prefer a shorter chapter. The story was smooth, and Maria certainly righted many wrongs, enabling the people she met along the way to certainly partake in the happily ever after."
4,An enjoyable comic...,"I am not really a Batman fan; nor, for that matter, am I a comics fan. I am, however, a genre fan, and I love the whole Predator mythos. This comic book has wonderful, dark artwork, really keeping the mood going, and the predator ""cloaking"" effect looks pretty cool here. The scripting is pretty good for the most part, and while the plot isn't great, it doesn't have to be -- Batman and the Predator duke it out! The action is a little confusing at times, but mostly it works well.The thing that bugged me most is that the predator played back recorded speech far too often, and in far too apropriate places. But his code of honor is there, his weapons are there...My only real complaint about this graphic novel is that the pages are normal comic paper instead of the glossier ""collected edition"" paper to which I've become accustomed.I recommended this book to fans of either of the title characters -- one of the better comics I've read in a while."
5,AN ENEMY FROM ANOTHERWORLD!!!!!!,In the dark city known as Gotham a dreaded killer is taking out the city's toughst boxers but their slaughter is not enough.The killer wants Batman and intends to get him but not without a brutal fight to the death in which the hunter becomes the hunted in the dark knights of Gotham City where an unspeakable killer lurks and stalks whom only Batman can stop!!
1,Truly awful,"Picked the three editions up at a local comic book shop because I thought it looked pretty cool and interesting - A Batman/Predator crossover? Sounds awesome! But I was truly disappointed. The plot is idiotic, the art is passable, the writing is awful (written by Dave Gibbons, the illustrator of Watchmen... maybe this gives us some insight as to why he endorses movie adaptations of Watchmen and the Watchmen prequels coming out this year). I really didn't feel like finishing the whole thing, but I wanted to get my money's worth. I beg you not to waste yours. Invest in quality."
1,Noise cancellation? What a joke!,"The fact that these claim they are noise cancelling headphones is quite a joke. I could hear a conversation between my kids in the next room, speaking in normal voices, while listening to music on these headphones. They're collapsible, which makes them less than sturdy and constantly falling off. They're not a bad headphone if you compare them to the cheaper types that fall in the $10-15 range, but the fact that they claim to ""eliminate up to 95% of ambient sound"" is quite ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
1,Lasted a matter of weeks,"I had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely. Fiddling with the cord doesn't help. For $50, I expected much better quality. I am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says ""Maxell"" again - you can't trust anybody these days, they've all gone for cheap and to heck with quality."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Okay, I needed something for at work so I could listen to music and videos without disturbing everyone else.I was reading reviews around the internet and they looked good. I read one that said they sound wicked and are cheap at Wal-Mart.com. I ordered them.I must say in their defence the noise cancelling aspect works alright... but that's all that works. The sound is way off... very high pitched and NO BASS at all. Believe me when I say that too... I tried numerous songs and tests... NONE at all. They are not what I was hoping for at all. Waste of money"
2,Kinda P*ssed off,"I got them out of the plastic and they're huge; they barely fit and I'm a medium-sized woman. So women: beware. Also, the cord is LLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG and drags almost to the ground. That's awkward for doing a lot of things: exercising, walking, sitting on the train."
4,Great Headphones for the Price,These noise-cancellation headphones are the cheapest that I could find for my transatlantic flight to Ireland. I had another pair previously for my flight to Hawaii from the east coast. The over the ear design reduces cabin noise and doesn't start to bother you for about 6 hrs of constant wear. Take a break for food and you're ready to go again. They had reasonable sound and adequate noise-cancellation to drown out crying babies and cabin noise. Add earplugs if you need total quiet to sleep. The price was right for my occasional needs and for kids.
4,Very Comfortable - Poor Wire Connection,"I use these at work to drown out the close cubicle noise. They are very very comfortable, you can wear them for 8 hours should you need to. The problem is that the wire connection between the earpieces is very sensitive. I had to send them back to Maxell to be repaired. Maxell was really great about the whole process. However, a couple months later, the problem reoccured and only the left side would work. Oh well."
3,Good price.. Not for long,"I paid $35 for these headphones, I saw that they were noise cancellation. It did do the job and did cancel alot of noises. It has it's advantages of only having one cord hooked to just one headphone instead of two like other headphones. They are a 'on ear' headphone and after alot of use of wearing them my ears started to hurt around the outside cartlidge area of the ear, and turned red. They apply a good amount of pressure to your ears. They didn't even last a year and the right headphone starting going out. If I wiggled the wire a certain way it would come back on, and then when I moved again it would go back off."
2,OK,So they're the best and they may not be the worst. I took them overseas and I was thankful they were there but it does not eliminate 95% of anything. The cord was not a problem for me as others have stated. I liked the length. Wish it had a volume button on the headphones to adjust sound. Battery life was fantastic. I took a 15 hour flight to and fro without having to place new batteries. Probably good for a lot shorter flights. Very compact!
1,Did not ship pictured product,I ordered the one in the VINTAGE box and did not get it meaning I will have to buy another FROM ANOTHER VENDOR.
5,This slinky does work,I'm not sure what the reviewers who said the slinky didn't go down the stairs were talking about. My 6 and 7-year old nephews have spent the last two days playing with it constantly and they can get it to go down our carpeted stairs perfectly. They absolutely love it and have now created an obstacle course/video game of sorts on the stairs.
2,Did you just change the cars oil??? Dirty hands after playing.,"The box says: ""A slight film of oil has been used to protect Slinky. If slightly sticky, wipe off with a clean cloth."" This is an understatement - I had to take these away from the kids because their hands were all greasy/oily with black oil after they played with these and then they would leave black hand marks on the walls.Maybe you can try washing these, but I would personally stay away from this one if you are intending to play with it."
4,Cream of the Crop,"Meade Skelton is one of the finest voices andwriters I have listened too. I was surprised tosee he is not on a major label.My favorite tracks are ""They Can't Keep Me Down""""Don't Rock This Boat"", and the clever ""Your Old Hay"".Those tracks standout the most, although I mustadmit I do enjoy all of the songs on this Album.Most of the songs are plenty upbeat. Althoughthere are some weepy tear jerkers, they are notbad either, just not my taste. His strongest assetis his powerful voice, and it's that kind of voiceyou just recognize right away, and never get sickof. Trust me. I played this on a recent car tripand my seven-year-old was actually entertainedfor once."
5,My Girlfriend Loved It,I bought this book for my girlfriend and she just loves it. It is part of a trilogy and this was the only one she hadn't read.
3,not bad at all..,"Dont get me wrong this CD was funny. Actually a light, laid back, airy type comedy. His talks about low fat chips, race difference, his wife, his marriage and a few things in between. I like how it starts out...he gets introduced and then he goes into him being at the carnegie hall."
4,Even the older kids loved it,"We purchased this for our grandson's 5th birthday, and it was a real hit. Even his 13 and 11 year-old siblings were fighting to play with it. So, we recently purchased another one for another grandson's 6th birthday. The vests are fairly flimsy, which is my only complaint. The brightly-colored goggles looked geeky to us, but the 11 and 13 year-old grandsons delighted in trying them on."
5,Never a miss,"I have used several recipes so far from this book, and both the Ginger Snappers and Lemon Cake Cookies were wonderful. Both contained plenty of butter and sugar, but did not turn out heavy or dense. Perfection. (And I am not usually a ""perfect"" baker!)"
3,It's okay,"Reasonably good, but the ""language"" is a bit archaic and the text does not always coincide with the closest diagram."
5,perfume mystery,"This book was first published in 1940 but doesn't show its age. The amateur detective has appeared in several books by Clason and this time is invited to a valley in California where the formerly Frenchman has a factory for producing great perfumes. He is afraid someone wants to poison him. Other characters include his lovely daughter, his scientist who is going to marry the daughter and several people involved in the business. The puzzle is fun and recommended for anyone who enjoys the golden age mystery story."
3,Just to let you know...,"Written by an author that calls herself a ""Christian ecumenical minster who serves as spiritual midwife..."" and very much leans toward Christian Science beliefs. She quotes from their text, as well as the Bible, and other belief systems.Since there was no product description, I just wanted to add this bit.The little that I read of it was too esoteric for me, hence the three stars. You may find it to be otherwise."
1,A compact rationale for ethnocentrism,"This book looks at a largely European science through the eyes of a civilization that hit its peak during the European dark ages. Astronomy mainly owes its foundation to Ptolemy and Sir Isdsac Newton. Neither are covered in this book. Reconciling conventional Muslim veiws and those of western science lacks any discussion of the intellectual foundations of either. Particularly lacking is any attempt to define scientific method in any terms that would be familiar to Bacon and Galileo. Certainly, there is ne discussion on the level of Sir Karl popper. Indeed this is a Muslin view of astronomy. Scientific method is much broader."
3,Pretty good,"This is an okay CD for a few good laughs as well as a bit of good old fashioned silliness. It's certainly nowhere nearly as good as Christmas Comedy Classics Vol. I. But it does have its moments like when Doug & Bob McKenzie (STRANGE BREW and Second City TV) sing their version of ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" (""On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: A beer-"") and Allan Sherman's version of the same song:A simulated alligator wallet (4th day)A calendar book with the name of my insurance man (3rd day)Green polka-dot pajamas (2nd day)And a Japanese transistor radio.If you already own Volume I, and it was good enough for you, then you could probably do without this one, but if you're just starving for Christmas comedy (a really sorry state in which to find oneself), then this is probably what you're after."
3,An Average Dictionary,"I've just started to learn French, and I picked up this dictionary before classes started because it was cheap and I figured I would need something to get started.This dictionary does a pretty good job for the money. The verb tables could have been fleshed out a bit more, as there isn't many conjugations at all to rely on. Also, the instructor I have is big on phonetics, and many times this dictionary has had inaccurate or missing phonetic characters. Still, the scope of the dictionary is good, and it does give plenty of words to help somebody get through some French translation or sentence construction. It even includes a few short phrases in many of the word definitions, which always helps. It wasn't long before I picked up a huge Larousse dictionary, and I would recommend upgrading quickly for anyone interested in pursuing French past a basic level."
3,GX-Silver IS Standard Grade,"There actually is no glich in Amazon's system, they just need to update their picture, so what the other reviewer got was correct, like the title says all Maxell GX-Silver tapes are what is now released ""Standard Grade"", and HGX-Gold is now released as ""High Grade""."
1,I don't know what's to like about this book!,"Interesting and suspect that there is only one review and of course its ""raving"". This book has not merit and is not worth the time it takes to read it."
2,Might be ok for a child,The setup is easy and it has some neat webcam type features. Picture quality is EXTREMELY poor. I never realized how valueable a preview display was either. Look elsewhere for a simple digital point and click.
5,SPINDLETOP,"Really a fascinating read. The saga of the Yount's, it truly a Texas tale. I really enjoyed the vintage photos, I have seen the oil manisons in Beaumont and they are quite spectacular, though the most famous the McFaddin Mansion was not shown, but this was a book that focused mainly on the Younts and though their mansion on Calder is long gone, the Great Gatsbyish Caldwood mansion is still extant and still breathtaking. This book is well researched and I believe anyone with an interest in a great story will enjoy this book: Mrs. Yount was one of a kind. Highly recommended."
4,A good soundtrack,"This soundtrack is defenetly worth bying with some of the biggist hip hop names on it including ice cube,snoop dogg,mack10,2pac and many more."
4,One of the best rap soundtracks there is,"90% of all the songs on here are real good, but I hear there was a ""re-release"". with a couple new tracks from a new Death Row rapper(Y.G.D. Top Dawg). I can't find it anywhere and I'd like to hear that one!!!!!"
2,Sad waste of talent.,Well meaning and a few funny moments by Jeff Goldblum get this more than one star but the cheesy formula plot and story just do not work. Eddie Murphy is great but this role here just doesn't do him justice. I wanted to like it and kept thinking it might get better but it just got worse.
2,DOES NOT REALLY WORK,"Slept through most of this movie, a real borefest. Not really funny, more sad that it takes a fool to wake some preppy idiots up, wow great fun-- not"
3,book review,"Didn't have an easy time going through. A lot of it is what has already been said before, just in different words."
2,Good phone but DON'T BUY if you need a voice recorder.,"I just got this phone, but one of the things I needed was the Voice Recorder but T-Mobile cripples the Voice Notes function by not allowing you to save your voice recordings to the phone; inexplicably, you can only forward them to voicemail. YES, that's right -- you CANNOT save them to memory for review later, so the ""Voice Notes"" function is basically worthless. (The other lesser RAZR's from T-Mobile let you, and CIngular and Verizon's version do too.) But with the V3t, you're SOL on Voice Notes. Great decision T-Mobile -- I'm returning the phone and going with Verizon."
5,Great Bedding!,"What you see in the picture is what you get! This natural pet bedding is the only type I use for my dwarf hamster and it works great! It is super absorbent and easy to clean up. As with any bedding though, it should be changed about every week to give your critter a clean environment!"
5,Best Pet Bedding I know of,"This stuff is decently priced and great great great! It doesn't start to smell until about two weeks. And you wouldn't want to leave any bedding around forever. Bedding can be expensive as often as it is replaced.I like the price for this stuff especially for the quality. My guinea pig loves it, and I love it. It is a win-win situation."
1,"maps are terrible, information on hiking/wilderness is poor","Don't buy this if you just want a hiking/camping guide. Here's why:* The author himself mentions that 50% of the book isn't really related to hiking (""adventuring"" as in the book's title)* The hikes are not described well. There are no total trail distances given.* There are no maps of trails/trailheads/wilderness areas, and that's what REALLY bugs me. There are virtually no maps in this book. The maps that are there are VERY pitiful. Without maps, this book is virtually useless to me.I would recommend that you look around at other books available if you're after a good hiking guide.Since the average rating is currently at 4.5 I'm gonna give this a 1 to try to add some balance to things..."
3,Did not feel the passion and fire - a bit bland,"Haitink's lean and quick style has been a revelation to me in the LSO live cds of the Beethoven's 5th, 7th and 9th. The lean style does help focus and simplify the music, but in the 2nd movement of the 6th the quick phrase style does not capture the emotional content of the 2nd movement but works in the first movement. Basically this style suits movements like the relatively faster movements and scherzo. This recording is sonically brilliant but the style of the reading does not overall evoke the 6th. The rustic power and swag of the third movement is missing; replaced by a feeble density where we require wholesome force; The storm section of the 6th is well done I must say; As much I tried to like this recording, I would say this one is great in patches but as a whole there is Something just off. The reading of the 2nd is also just about average."
5,Very Sound Precepts with good examples. Interesting book.,"These four authors are really on to something which needs to be considered by not only educators , but parents of girls who more and more need to be strengthened in their abilities to compete in the fast-moving technical, mathematical and scientific world of the future. Their precepts are very sound."
5,Extraordinarily inspiring and entertaining,"A must see for EVERYONE interested in theater, entertainment and fascinating personalities. A must HAVE for anyone involved in teaching the theater arts. One of the most entertaining, endearing, informative films to come along in a very long time. What a talent and what a life!"
5,"There's nothing like ""The Life of Reilly""","An acquaintance of mine who collaborated with Charles Nelson Reilly years ago recommended this and I was simply floored by it. I'm not a theater fan, nor am I at all familiar with Mr. Reilly from film or television, but he is mesmerizing in this one-man show that recounts episodes from his fascinating life. In the space of a minute's time, the narrative can move from hilarious to shocking to deeply sad to heartwarming to humorous. It's really something to experience."
5,A book that redefines the genre...,"Challenge The Wind is a vivid masterwork of historical fiction that brings to life the world of a fifteenth-century Basque adventurer, and does so with a great deal of accuracy and perspective. The author's extensive research is evident in the rich, detailed background into which she skillfully weaves this exciting and emotional tale. Challenge The Wind represents a historical and cultural renaissance that will force the reader to reconsider the very nature of personal, religious, and national identity."
3,okay,It's a diet book. You should know what you are getting when you buy it. i need five more words.
4,Just a quick note BURNOUT 5 I did not actually rate this game to my opinion,"Just for all you Burnout fans and if you're not, buy the game, plop it in to the console and glue your eyes to the screen for the next 6 hours.BURNOUT 5 is coming out shotly after the PS3 does in November and is for the PS3, maybe PS2, i'm not sure about xbox, and not on any Nintendo We-We or whatever the hell it is. I'll tell you my review, in a bit."
5,Top notch moccasins,I had to buy these because I'm not allowed to wear shoes in my house and I was tired of stubbing my toes on things. I almost lost a nail hitting it twice in one week. So they're basically house shoes.I went with the moose because I wanted a wide size. They fit great and I ordered my usual size. They are very well cut and the leather is buttery soft and seems durable so far. I've worn them a few weeks around the house. The insoles are a bit smooth and stick to your feet if your feet get hot. These are better with socks but I wear them either way. Overall they give off a better impression of quality than you can see on the internet. They easily look like something you could find at the back of Banana Republic marked for $200.It is a bummer that they are not made in USA but I've been to the Dominican Republic and it is a wonderful place with friendly people. They import a lot of things from the US too so it kind of works out for everybody.
2,Nonplused,"This book is about a pig named Elbert Ein Swine. It starts off by telling us where Elbert lives, and how Mr. Hall (who lives near-by) notices how Elbert is no ordinary pig because he can do math and problem solving. Because Elbert is no ordinary pig, Mr. Hall enrolls Elbert in Pigdom School. Then it tells the story of how Elbert was able to figure out what a message said, when no-one else was able to.I was completely nonplused by this book. I can find no clear plot in it, and nothing to excite interest. The thing I liked the most about it was the names. I especially like Elbert's name. The illustrations also are not the best. They are not colorful, and lack enthusiasm. The pictures are colored in shades of red and gray, which make them look very strange to me. In short, I liked the title, and that was about it.Loggie log log log"
4,"Firesign, 70's insanity","A short review: Firesign is generally very good, this is quite good in particular.If you enjoy 70's type intellectual doper humor, get this one. It does require concentration, though..."
3,Not so classic,"CLASSIC ROCK: Vol.2 Men At Work is an album of modest proportions, with a program to match.PLAYLIST--Rock This Town - Stray CatsTuff Enuff - The Fabulous ThunderbirdsWhat I Like About You - The RomanticsPride And Joy - Stevie Ray VaughanAmerican Music - The BlastersSee The Light - Jeff HealeyShakin' Shakin' Shakes - Los LobosBoogie Motel - FoghatIt's A Wild Weekend - NRBQ"
3,"Heartfelt, but simplistic","""Freedom"" is a heartfelt song talkin' about freedom, but the lyrics are simplistic and ultimately unsatifying. Obviously the song was written soon after the events of September 11, when emotions were strong and basic. As a long-time McCartney fan, I would have liked to hear Paul write a song that reflected the complexities of the issues of freedom and terrorism. What comes to mind is the early Wings song ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"", which showed the courage to question the way things are and to dream of a better world."
5,Fantastic book,"I'm addicted to mystery / thriller books and this one kept me on my toes to the last page!Good plot, well written without unnecessary side plots this book will take you to a ""unexpected"" end!The ""who did it"" taken to a very high level."
1,Dull read,Usually G. Heyer's books are lovely and enjoyable. Penhallow was neither. It went on and on with unpleasant people with nothing to recommend them. A sure disappointment.
5,A must read for anyone caring for children Drs/teachers..etc,"This is an amazing book. A must read for all who might be connected to a person who has a disability and their amazing families- from dentist, to teacher, to the ice cream store owner! It's pausing and gives wise perspective.This book is pointing to every breath a mother takes in the love of her child and her family. We can never be reminded enough about the impact we potentially have when our worlds collide- like the two mothers in Hurricane Dancing. Working in human services isn't just a job and we should take the time to look at the work we are doing and constantly self-monitor our growth as a person and as a professional.Julie Lambert- Senior Clinician, Integrated Clinical Solutions, Georgetown, MA"
5,I recommend all of the Progeny Press Study Guides,So far we have done several Progeny Press study guides and this one is just as thorough as all the rest. My children and I would recommen them for grades 4-8.
2,The Langoliers,"Long, drawn-out, & incredibly boring, I was very disappointed with this movie. Lost my attention almost immediately. Had high expectations given it was based on a Stephen King novel but was generally unhappy with it."
1,One of the worst horror/suspense movies w/ animated creature,"This movie should not be that long it totally sucks.You waste your time thinking something good is gonna happen and too see animated creatures that look like tremors in a way,which i suggest better off looking at tremors which has good special effects.Visual effects in this movie is bad,is just like looking at cartoons that some how got into this Stephen King movie."
3,Stephen King does it again.,"Take that how you wish - If you like the other King movies, maybe this one you'll like too... I was hoping for something more, the cool criters in the other dimension were fun - but I've seen it someplace before I'm sure. It's all very much a copy of a bunch of other movies hashed together - lots of Doctor Who style bits there with that good ol' King touch :p.I've not read the book, maybe it'll hurt less..."
3,Mildly Interesting,"I found the whole thing sort of silly, except for the ending. The Star Trek effect of entering the gate on the return to Los Angeles was interesting, & so was the ending episode at the L.A. airport. Otherwise - yawn......But maybe that's just me. It's received 5 stars from others so you may also enjoy it."
1,Are you ready for some fun? here we go:,"1. Buy it used, for the .80 cents its worth.2. Get some old family members together, preferably distant cousins and some nasty in-laws.3. Find a torch, a nail gun and perhaps an ignitor4. Perform operation in a safe place, away from trees or animals5. Take DVD, still unopened from packaging, ie. either mailing bubble or shrink wrap, and light up the sky. (ritual must be performed at night to get full affect)It is too bad, had some really talented actors in it. It was painful to watch this. I am sorry some talent will take any work, just to be on screen. This was appalling."
4,Good interview light,"I ordered this light for interviewing in low-light situations and found it to be great for that. It also helps add color when filming in flourecent lit situations. The battery isn't too bulky but the case separated from it's belt clip and the battery fell to the ground my first time using it. After devising a better clip system, I'm completely satisfied with this product. It weighs almost nothing. It is 40 watts so it isn't for lighting up the night but sure adds great fill lighting."
5,Good product if you are on the go ...,"I have to admit, I have been using slow cookers for a lot of years and I really don't find that much difference between them. However, when cooking at home and bringing prepared foods with you, this product is great. No more sliding lids, and it keeps the food warm for a long time."
5,I love it !,"I bought mine at FARM & FLEET on sale. I think I spent 20 bucks. I've had it for almost 2 years and nothings cracked or broke. It cooks very well, in fact I used it today for pork stew. Yummy. like others have said, I like the handles, the looking lid, that I can take the insert out to clean and that it came with a spoon. I also like that I can take it to someones house and not spill anything. I do have one other, the famous crock pot brand that my sister gave to me. After the first use I was hooked but,the handles started to fall apart and it's a smaller one so I don't use it much anymore except for small meals. I'm still after almost 2 years learning how to use it. I found the if there isn't enough liquid in it stuff burns. It works so well that one time I cooked chicken w/the bones in and the bones got mushy. I guess I cooked it too long. Ya live and learn I guess."
5,Great slow cooker for get-togethers!,"I was looking for a larger slow cooker than the two Crock Pots we own now when I found this portable model from Hamilton Beach. I love it!It's ideal for either transporting food to a get-together or cooking at home. The lid has a rubber seal and locks down with latches on both sides, which eliminates concerns about leaks or spills when traveling. There are also sturdy handles for ease of transportation, and it comes with a spoon that fits into the handle on the lid. The 6-qt. size is just right when we have company or when asked to bring a covered dish to a function. The inner pot lifts out for easier clean-up and is dishwasher safe. And there are three settings~ high, low, and warm, making it perfect for the buffet table.I'd recommend this pot to anyone who likes to cook for a crowd."
5,Everything I Needed,"I'm so happy with this purchase. I have had this slow cooker for 5 months now, and it works well every time. The locking option for the cover is very helpful when taking this to parties, and the attached spoon is a cute touch. The spoon isn't anything fancy, but it certainly works!It's very easy to clean as well, the inner shell pops out easily and washes quickly."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"This phone has nice 2-line features but we have tried two of them in our home office and both have suffered from poor out-going sound quality.Overall the features of this phone are very good for a home office and if GE would fix the sound issue, we would be happy to have one.Pros:2 independant voice mail boxes.Can retreive VM from the handset or base.Displays external voicemail from our phone service.Base and handset speaker phone.Expandable.Cons:Sound quality is poor (clients were complaining that our voices sounded scratchy and far away).Poor selection of ringers.Silly melody ringers not appropriate for a office."
4,"Not bad for a needledrop, definitely worth getting!","You know, I discovered Gerry Rafferty's early music by accident when I picked up a couple of cut-out cassettes back in the day. When I saw this album that contained the entire ""Can I Have My Money Back"" plus almost another entire album worth of extra tracks, I had to get it.I was instantly blown away by the sound quality. The lows were deep and rich, the highs were sharp without being piercing. This recording is very organic and plays very nice for an hour plus.Here is the beautiful part..... it took me over three years to realize that I was listening to a perfect needledrop recording. There is nothing wrong with it, but it blew me away on how nice and clean this recording was.I still listen to it and enjoy it often (like during my ride in from work today, in fact!)If you enjoy Gerry's harmonic vocals and like early James Taylor, then you will really LOVE this!!!"
2,Crappy remote,"The DVD player works as it should: no skipping, clear picture, the minimum. But the remote control is finicky. Any and all functions seem to require multiple pressings of the buttons. I have to have the angle of the remote to the sensor exactly straight and within eight feet. What good is a remote that requires me to get up off the couch to get it to work.I am now searching the Web for a replacement remote, or a universal remote which will work with this DVD player. Turns out that the remote that came with it, besides being finicky, was also made of cheap plastic and internal connections. It shattered on frustrated impact.Cheap, lousy piece of... equipment."
1,Do not buy!,"Bought this for my 3 yr old son for Christmas. It lasted MayBE 24 hrs. It came apart at the seams and stuffing is everywhere. It wasn't even aggressively used. I hung it up and it was punched and kicked by a 3yr old. Do NOT buy this!!!! For $40, this was a HUGE waist of money."
1,LOW QUALITY MATERIALS,My son is only 5 yrs old and this bag tore in the first 3 minutes of him playing with it. Going to try duck tape! I would not recommend this product to anyone over 3 yrs old.
3,very small,its so tiny.. picture made it look bigger. arrived very fast ans packaged well. gloves built kinda cheap. good for a small kid.
2,Too small!!!,"This punching bag is very small. There were no size dimensions listed for it, but it said for ages 7 and up so I assumed it was a nice size. I got it in yesterday and it is only about 24 in. long and maybe 8 inches in diameter. (I don't have it in front of me to measure). I was very disappointed as I thought this would be a great gift for my 6 year old. The material it is made of seems durable, but then again it hasn't been played with. I was trying to keep from buying a leather/vinyl bag as they are really too big. I am looking into returning it as I don't see it being big enough for him to play with. I would say it is more for a 3 year old."
1,Get what you pay for...,"Get what you pay for... Unfortunately, it wasn't even worth that price. I purchased this for my 2 year old for fun, since he likes to hit my 100lb bag. He has some fun with it but the materials are so cheap, he doesn't even like the gloves. The bag gets beat on by my 10 year old also and is already starting to fall apart at the seams. It might last longer if you only allow soft hitters on it."
1,Destroyed in seconds,"So disappointed! The seams were not strong enough for my little nephew's punch! It ripped almost instantly! After a duct tape repair, the straps ripped out of the seam as well. NOT DURABLE at all. So sorry!This is suitable only for a little kid, 2 or 3 years old!"
4,Mysterious fun!,I loved this book. It's an original who-dun-it with a main character that will have you laughing the whole way through. Very well written and attention grabbing from the get go. I will definitely be reading more!
3,"It's fun, but...","""Dying in Style"" is the first of Elaine Viets' books I've picked up, and while I enjoyed myself enough to try one or two more, I don't think she's going on my auto-buy list yet for a few things.The characters are lively, the writing moves quickly and smoothly, but...several times times Viets telegraphs what's coming next with lines of ""If she'd known three people would die within the next few days, perhaps she would have answered differently"" or ""Tomorrow, she would meet with betrayal."" She's laid in some lovely forshadowing, building tension and leading us toward something bad happening -- then breaks it by holding up a sign that says ""Look! Bad things ahead!""It's a personal quibble, but one that really did affect my rating and keep it from being higher. Aside from that, fun book and worth the time."
5,Guy Williams is a Great Sinbad,I remember seeing this many years ago and I was thrilled to see Captain Sinbad was available on dvd. It was a Christmas gift and my brother and I enjoyed the movie. It is colorful and has some good special effects!
4,"Looks OK, but Amazon's description is misleading.","Be warned that Amazon's description is slightly inaccurate. Under 'Specifications' Amazon's product page says: ""Output Engine Start: 100A"". However, this model does NOT have an Engine Jumpstart feature like the SC-10030A does (seeSchumacher SC-10030A SpeedCharge Automatic Charger and Maintainer). Otherwise, product looks fine. I am thinking of keeping it anyway to recharge my car's battery when, on account of mysterious German electronics, it becomes too drained to start the car after just 2-3 days of sitting unused in the garage."
4,15A Car Battery Charger,"Bought this charger as a replacement for an older Schumacher that worked great for many years in exposed weather conditions until it failed a few weeks ago. The old unit was directly in snow, ice, and generally cold temps to keep a charge on a car in storage for the Winter. The new charger will remain indoors due to some charging cable extenders I made to reach the exposed car. The fan is quite loud, so put the charger on a plug in timer to only charge overnight. So far so good."
4,Does the job but is noisy.,Does a fast charge and tells you the % and voltage level of the battery.One problem I have noticed is that it will say the battery is 100% (but not done) whenI use if off a generator. I don't notice the same problem when using commercial power.The fan is a turn off but it does get the job done.
5,Charged up,I had a neighbor that loaned this same charger to me and I loved it so much I bought one. Great value for the money and works just like others will comment on.
1,worthless,"this is another ""smart"" battery charger that will not charge a battery that needs charging. if the battery that i want to charge is less than 10 volts this charger will not charge at all.the whole point of a charger is to charge batteries that are low or dead. this one will do neither."
2,I love this charger when it isn't broken.,"This charger worked great for the most part. I have had the problem where it gets stuck at 85% and keeps running. When I disconnect it and reconnect it it reads 100%.Lately it started looking like it was charging but it wasn't charging. There is a relay internally that is undersized for 15 A and it had a burned out lead. I repaired it and now it works like it used to. It is really sad that this potentially great product is cripled by some cheap componenents.I also have had the fan problem with it being really noisy. I peeled the sticker off the fan and put some Lube-One lubricant in it and now it works fine.Like I said, this is a great charger when it isn't broken."
3,Heartbeat,"Annie loves to run and so does her fiend Max. Neither one likes running on a team, just the feeling of there lungs pounding, there legs moving under them as fast a possible. However Annie persuades max to join the school running team, but max doesn't normally wear shoes when he runs so during the race Max trips and falls. Max gets upset at Annie, who had to leave the race right after Max tripped and fell because her mother was having a baby.Heartbeat is about finding your place in life, your rhythm or your heartbeat.I would not recommend this book, the book's pace in very slow and boring compared to Sharon Creehes other books."
4,Great for seasoning!,I used this to spice my chicken before grilling and the taste was great. I use it for soup and stew and even use it to cook rice. I'll recommend it to anyone who is looking for something tasty in their food!
1,"Mac users do not buy! Another ""defective"" CD",Another one of those annoying CDs with the bogus copy protection that won't allow you to play the CD in your Mac. Boycott these stupid companies.
1,Lame,"This movie had potential because I like the subject matter and the plot was OK until the grand finally at the end which should have been about annihilation of the ego shifted into revelations , unfortunately it felt cheesy, the dialog was poor, the acting was mediocre, and it just overall seemed trite. I have nothing against low budget films this just was just missing too many things.Too bad because we got duped by the one review which was by someone involved in making the film."
4,A Good Intro to HS Portraiture,"I'm an artist and art teacher, and each year I read the book, ""Chuck Close Up Close"" to my high school Art I students and follow up by showing this movie. As another teacher pointed out, some parts simply move too slowly, and I've gotten around this by doing some fast-forwarding. (This also allows time for discussion in our 50-minute class periods.)Still, I consider ""A Portrait in Progress"" a good introduction to the whole artistic process, and the kids have a window into the life of a contemporary artist and better understand how they'll be approaching their own self-portrait work."
5,A Excelent book of this Great Calvinist,"In this book you will have a idea of how this `Prince of Preaches` look the ministery and have some details about Spurgeon, It's a shame that is back order. but you will love."
5,"Bring it back!! Or, at least make it so I can obtain all the episodes ...","I loved this show! It was very funny, very witty. While it ran, it and ""Heroes"" were the only shows I would not miss. How could this have been cancelled? Networks used to let a show stay on for a while, find it's audience. Anyway ... if I can't have new episodes, could I at least have access to all of those now available? I keep telling my friends about the show, but cannot find a way for them to SEE all of the episodes."
4,light entertainment,"I finished this book last night after a one-day read. Not bad. The characters kept me interested. Especially enjoyed Eleanor, the mother. Felt that she was a believable and sad left-behind housewife. What I did have a hard time believing was the age of the main character. She seemed to have a lot of wisdom for a late-20's young mother. I can't imagine a grad student at that age being so introspective about marriage. She actually figured out that if you give marriage a chance and can get over the immature stumbling blocks of the early years, it may actually turn out well. It usually takes an empty-nester to realize that! Overall, it was entertaining."
1,NOT the Abyssinians!,"Buyer beware! This album does not contain the music of the Abyssinians. It is a compilation CD of various artists covering an Abyssinians' song. Most songs on the album are just dubs of the original, using the exact same sample repeatedly. I love the music of the Abyssinians and many of the artists featured on this album. However, after listening to three or more songs, you may become sick of hearing the same rhythm/melody over and over. Maybe not. I leave it up to you. Pease&luv always."
3,Flawed but fascinating,"George Pal, one of the most underrated filmmakers who worked during the Golden Age of Hollywood, made his most ambitious film, this, in 1962. Running 135 minutes with overture and intermission, it's a very curious project that seems especially incongrous in Cinerama. At times it drags and seems a bit silly, but it comes off as one of those films which seem detached in time, as it does not seem dated, but never would have been made today. The three fairy tale sequences are the film's highlight, with top-notch Puppetoon animation. Watch this on TCM, and petition for a DVD release. This needs a good DVD, AND NOW!!!Jamie Teller"
3,"Once a Grand Duchess, Xenia","Yes, this is an important volume on the Romanov family history. Van der Kiste is an excellent author, easily readible.HOWEVER, this price is simply outrageous ! It must be a mistake."
1,bad experience,"I just recieived this thing today - and the part on the autowinder that is supposed to catch the cord and keep it in place all of a sudden broke. That means I have to hold on to the cord while I listen to music or else the winder tries to wind it up. Then, while extremely frustrated and trying to fix it, I pulled at it a little too hard and snapped the cord in half. I just flushed $20 down the drain. Don't buy it."
3,It Could be Better.,"The book is a good start to MATLAB students but there is a lot of errors in the text. Despite the author's appeal asking everybody to show him the errors, I think it would be better to rewrite the book, mainly because his work could be more useful if he insert a specific chapter about I/O operations, which is, in my opinion, the most dificult thing to do in MATLAB. Examples of I/O operations with several data formats would be useful too."
1,Not so much,"The design of the trap is logical, but has proven to be ineffective for me. Gophers just push dirt over the trap before entering the baited area. No chance for the trap to work due to it being buried in dirt. Have baited the holes in an effort to get them to investigate instead of pushing the dirt. I have seen videos of this product on YouTube and they seem to work for them. Total bust for me."
4,Silence Hurts No Man?,"But it almost hurts Lucy Durmast. She has been arrested for murder of one of her father's employees, and responds to the accusation with total silence. Sloan is put on the case because of the demise of the officer that had been previously investigating, and he has to determine whether Lucy is indeed guilty. It brings a whole bunch of things to the Berebury Police detachment including the African kingdom of Dlasa and some high profile civil engineering projects. Even though I figured out the means and who did the deed, it was still an interesting read as all of Ms. Aird's books are."
1,Stay Away,"Complete waste of money. Product dissolved into powder when placed in water. I was trying to make bubble tea, as I have many many times with other varieties of tapioca pearls which did not dissolve on me. Stay away."
1,"Breaks apart, dissolved in water! Poor quality","Bought this from one of the sellers here and was fulfilled by Amazon. When soaked, all of the tapioca pearls dissolved into water in mere 10 minutes! When cooked without soaking, they again dissolved and got mixed in with water! The package looks DIFFERENT from the one pictured here. It doesn't have any logos on it but states: Product of Thailand. No expiration date is printed anywhere. Dunno if the quality had anything to do with its use-by date. Can't recommend this to anyone."
4,"Great sound and value, but hurts my ears","Pros:- Great sound (for its class)- Nice long cord (not to short, not too long)Cons:- It feels like my ears are going to fall off after wearing them for thirty minutes.If comfort is no issue, then these are the best cheap headphones around."
2,Don't buy if you value your hair!,"I also bought these headphones for work. While the sound quality is good, they are large, clunky, and have the habit of pulling out your hair at the sides where the earphones are attached. If you are female and value not having your hair pulled out every time you remove the headphones, purchase another kind!"
4,cool stuff for cheap,Hey ! They are comfortable and work good. I really like it. I think it's a good deal for $15 ! Sound quality is cool. I would definitely recomend it.
1,they sound as cheap as they are,"I couldn't tell whether the phones were any good because the housing made the headphones sound like I was listening inside a cardboard box. Hollow, terrible sound. I don't mean terrible compared to top quality headphones, I mean terrible compared to what you get with your average Walkman!"
3,Nice sound but comfortability has a lot to be desired for,"First off, lovely sound, nice bass, nice high-end notes. If these headphones had comfortable ear-pieces, this product would get a 4 or 5.Now my ears seem normal enough, but wearing these for, say, 3 hours, take the headphones off, and I am in a lot of pain for about 5 minutes. The cartalidge sticking out on my ears presses against the plastic innards of the headphones... and this really really hurts after a while. So this is a big problem with them.I would not buy this product again simply because of the discomfort it has caused me."
2,90 day wonder,"The sound on these headphones was fine, while it worked. It just stopped working after about 3 months of use. It's not like I abusing the product. I used on the subway for the ride to and from work. That's about it. An hour and a half a day. It's too light to use as a doorstop, so I guess it's now useless. I'd stay away from this product."
3,appreciate this adaptation on its own terms,"truth be told, there has never been a fully satisfactory film adaptation of twains masterpiece, and i doubt there ever could be -- but taken on its own terms this is a charming movie. originally planned as a big-screen musical (i leave it to others to give that particular contorted history, but you can still hear several of the dumped songs in the background score), it finally emerged as a straight telling of the most famous parts (read least controversial) of twains novel. eddie hodges is a credible huck and boxing great archie moore is a surprisingly effective jim, with strong supporting work from tony randall and mickey shaughnessy as the the dauphin and the duke, and (among others) patty mccormack, andy devine, and the too-little-seen buster keaton. like i said, there will never be a perfect screen huck, but this comes as close as any."
1,Is this the 1939 Mickey Rooney movie?,Can anyone verify if this is the 1939 movie with Mickey Rooney? The reviews and details here are sending a message that the cover is misleading and the actors as described for this dvd is not the 1939 movie.Amazon was not able to verify which version of the movie is offered. Thanks to anyone who can answer my inquiry.
1,This movie was to different from the book.,The movie skips important parts of the book. Also I would imagine that Huckleberry Finn would look a bit tougher. I mean look at the kid who is playing Huck- a little red head that doesn't even know how to act. Don't buy this movie.
1,What a waste of time for homesteaders!,"This a small, simple book. Engagingly written, it hardly merits the price. Have a look at ""How to Find Your Ideal Country Home: Ruralize Your Dreams"" -- spend a little more money and get some useful information. This is the first book I ever returned."
4,I like it,"Have not used the grinder for coffee, but use it to grind spices all the time. Works like a charm."
3,Not Worth Watching Twice,The movie was alright. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. It's also always difficult to see children getting treated badly. I don't think I would ever watch it again.
2,Treeless Mountain,I thought maybe it was just me but after my sister and my mother watched the movie ..they provided the same feedback...basically...it's alright. Not the attention retentive movie. The movie background/concept sounded great but the outcome left me disappointed and wanting to return the movie...
4,Neat little dog,So the i-dog was a popular choose for christmas this year with my kids. I got this spidey dog on sale for a great price on amazon. I love the free shipping. This little guy is cute. My kids are 4-6 years old - great age group for this toy. You take the i-dog and plug it into any music source - it has a headphone jack. It is a speaker for you mp3 player and also is a toy that is a dog that has a personality. Really cute.
4,Great little phone,"The main appeal with this phone is that it's black,(sometimes in retail I have found it hard to find any color other than white), has a small footprint, and it works well. What more could your ask."
3,Not for the beginner,"I bought this book because it is a classic. It is hard reading, the style is dry and somewhat bloated, a combination that makes you dislike the author immediately. That is a shame, for the author is clearly very knowledgeable. If only he had tried to be a bit friendlier, try to TEACH instead of PREACH...Definitely NOT for beginners, not even for intermediate level readers."
2,The exercises are difficult,"The examples in the text are very simple but the exercises in the back of each chapter are very difficult. The simple examples are a poor reference for the much more complicated questions that lack solutions. This makes learning, by using this book, very difficult."
1,Save your money,"Get another book, Stark and Woods is quite good, not an excellent introduction but still much better. Papoulis is viewed on by our lecturers as being close to the THE book on the subject - probably due to the fact that they used it in their time.AS long as you understand the concept of Random Variables as a transformation mapping, Stark & Woods will take you by the hand and show you the landscape of the immensely important subject. It is quite example driven but does seem considerably better that Papoulis(maybe better as a reference rather than a text book)"
1,"It's not for learning, just for havign a reference of all the formulas.",This book didn't help me to better understand the subject. It just throws formulas and examples with very little explanation of the steps taken to solve them.
1,Notes to the Professors who want to use this book,"Pls professors if u were not able to fully digest and reorganize this book , then do not use it. It is a high level and excellent but not for courses.It is confusing and not well organized. He hides a lot of important results in the problems. Many of the problems not in the scope or covered by the material in the book. So please please if u are not good enough do not use it. I'm suffering now because of this terrible book."
3,get ready to sweat,"the product works and funtions as advertised but its not the easiest thing in the world to use.I am taking into account the drought this year,which made the soil harder than normal."
3,Compare before you buy.,"For $... you can buy Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia with almost double the number of entries (25,000), and more than a 1000 (!!) extra pages. Just think about it... So many important topics you don't find in the Oxford, but you do in Merriam-W. Many others Oxford gives a mere 2 or 3 lines, whereas in Merriam-W. you find a much more extended coverage. And that for less the money. The only reason I could see to buy the Oxford instead of Merriam-W. would be for high school students who's demands may be limited, and who just love those maps and colored illustrations. I got both, the Oxford ...for a mere couple of dollars, and Merriam-W. just for the shipping costs from Book of the Month Club. But between the two I know that I'll be using the latter a whole lot more."
2,how about two stars and a negative review,"Three Men and a Baby is the kind of comedy film that did NOT date well at all. All those cheesy and dated effects used in the late 80's will probably take you back to those memorable years of your life when watching the movie, but unfortunately Three Men and a Baby will probably only remind you what the decade was like actually putting up with this style of comedy as popular entertainment at the time. It's not funny, it's somewhat annoying, severely dated, and it's just the kind of DVD you should avoid."
5,Comedies don't get much better than this,"Tom Selleck is the mature father figure, Ted Danson is the ""look at me"" actor, Steve Guttenberg is the second string comedian. This trio meets one little bitty girl and their lives are forever changed. If you are looking for a relaxing movie with lots of fun, this is it!"
2,"Buy ""Three Men and a Little Lady"" instead","This is one of those rare situations where the sequel is significantly better than the original film.""Three Men and a Baby"" is a girl flick -- silly plot, cute baby, three men acting like Alan Alda (i.e., effeminate), enough to make any reasonable person want to throw up.""Three Men and a Little Lady"" is infinitely superior, and funnier. I never thought much of Ted Danson until I saw the final scene in this film, in which he plays a senile Anglican priest -- a comic masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the disk.Alternatively, consider buying ""Three Men and a Cradle,"" the French film upon which ""Three Men and a Baby"" was based. It has received significantly better reviews."
4,A good companion to Martres's books,"One look at Martres's two books on photographing the Southwest convinced me to immediately buy his CDs as well. Many of the photos are stunning and Martres's fair use conditions are generous. The images are good companions to the book as you can copy the good setup angles that he has spent years finding. Also he avoids overly heavy use of filters so that what you see in the images represents what you may actually see in the field. There are a few times in which the criteria for including pictures seems to be the success of the shots rather than the significance of the places visited. (For example, Angel Arch in Canyonlands is not included.) Also, I found the links that some of the images had to his chosen jpg viewer (included) quirky. His may be more viewer than you want or need. Fortunately, it is possible to get around the included viewer and use your own jpg viewer. On the whole, the CD is very worthwhile."
1,Only usable for bread crumbs,"This stuff tastes horrid out of the package, and there are better option out there. We even tried using it for French Toast, but it was still barely edible. The only reason I'd buy it again is to crumble it up if I needed breadcrumbs for a recipe."
2,arrival of product,My EnerG bread came in a box that was to flimsy for the product.Some damage was done could have been when packed or in transit.Some loaves were not what I would have picked in a store .
3,SO SO,"It's not the best choice of bread.It's very small, taste like plastic,it's hard to eat it if not toasted.the good part is that it's gluten free but if you want to enjoy your gf BREAD you better run to Whole foods."
1,"Mmmmm, I don't think so!","As a student of GSA (Glasgow school of Art), I am perhaps in the best position to comment on such a subject. It seems to me that if Mr. Mackintosh ever visited the school , he did so with his eyes closed. He has completly missed the point of the building. Radically undestating its importance and beauty. Most of all I feel that it is truly hurtful the way in which he described the ""menial nature"" of the staff which enhabit this fine establishment. Although the text itself is completly removed from the reality the pictures are sweet."
4,Excellent Southern Gothic,"Long before he won an Oscar for writing Gods and Monsters, Bill Condon showed his talent with Sister, Sister -- an atmospheric slice of Southern Gothic suspense that deals with two sisters who run a hotel, a swamp that holds many ghosts, and the prerequisite deep dark secrets of the past. If you really waste your time deeply analyzing the plot, it won't make a bit of sense by waste your time doing something as silly as that? With excellent performances from Judith Ivey, Dennis Burkley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Eric Stoltz, this is one of the most entertaining, low budget horror films that I have ever seen. This movie was made before Leigh and Stoltz achieved their current levels of fame and is recommended to anyone who knows them only from their more recent, more commercial films."
5,Great book!,This book offers many unusual and delicious recipes for all kinds of greens. I have found it very helpful in preparing all the different types of greens we have growing in our garden right now.
1,bad edition,"The kindle edition of L'Education Sentimentale (in french) by Flaubert is just awful. No dots, no commas, lack of paragraphs and part of sentences that make the reading nearly impossible. I'm not complaining about Flaubert's writing, but about the kindle edition I've got.L'edition Kindle de L'Education Sentimentale de Flaubert en Franais est affreuse. Il y a de graves problemes de ponctuation et d'edition. Cela rend la lecture practiquement impossible."
2,"Ummm...not such a tasty choice for gluten free""ites""","Although the dietary stats are pretty impressive, the consistency is mushy and the taste is bland. Toasting it doesn't even help. I have had much better gluten free bread products. My freezer is now full of this product and I WILL finish it eventually, but I won't purchase this particular item again."
5,AWESOME!,"These were the coolest sunglasses (novelty or regular) that I have ever purchased, and I would buy them again in a hearbeat."
3,Great Value,"These boots are really cute over skinny jeans and look great with babydoll dresses too. They don't look cheap, but are really not expensive. We will see how long they last!"
2,looks more like gray,looks more gray than blue (requires 15 words to review this - hi how you doing :) Three more words. Fine I hope. :)
1,Bad experience,"Received it about a week ago. The voice quality was so poor that I could barely hear the other person. In addition, for some reason its microphone was somehow connected to its speaker so my voice got echoed in the phone. It was a bad experience and I had to return it."
1,Expensive catalog,"This book could have been written as an Excel spreadsheet. It is mostly a collection of specifications, but the tables are not easy to compare on a kindle. The few pictures are all black and white, too dark, don't blow up well, no schematics to explain operation. Names are dropped, but there is no coherent story. I read the whole book but was disappointed."
2,"Herbs ""Are-Not"" a Cure","If there was a way to prevent breast cancer with diet, this would be a significant book. Instead it is misleading and untrue. Arnot should stick to weight lossbooks."
4,Great book for those who want to lower their risk.,"On the eve of my Mother's 3rd anniversary of dying from Breast Cancer, I decided to read this book and try to make sense of it all. I have watched 2 great Aunts, 1 Aunt and my Mother die from this disease, and often wonder when it is my turn. Instead of waiting for it to happen, I bought the book, (and one for my sister also). Finally, someone trying to lower the risk before it happens. I liked the way he explained the risk factors we here of so often, and the way they are related to diet (which nobody ever really has explained yet). The only thing I didn't like about the book, was that there are no recipes to follow. In reading reviews on his other book, about losing weight, people said the same thing. DIDN'T HE LEARN FROM THE FIRST BOOK!!! To follow a mediterrian or asian diet, people need recipes. I couldn't put the book down, but think he should follow up with a cookbook."
4,"GOOD, WITH RESERVATIONS!!!!!","First of all, Devil Girl is presented in a very good print with no issues. Mesa of Lost Women is glaringly missing the pre-credit sequence(25 sec.) you can find on other editions. There is also one splice where you lose approx. 10 sec. of dialogue.These problems could of been avoided by using a second print. I don't know why these people don't do that, and do it right the first time. It leaves us still looking for a complete print. Astounding She-Monster is a good viewing print in full screen, but that is not it's OAR. Wade Williams apparantly acquired this film and put his WW Prod. title at the start of the film and not before it started , which it where it should be placed."
2,Amazon Verified Purchase,"Although this product works, it is very difficult to use. I bought it because I didn't want to pay the significantly higher price for a metal hole punch that could be configured to punch 7 holes for my planner pages. Even when I use it to punch holes in only one sheet at a time, I need to press very hard (so hard it hurts my palms & wrists) and it is difficult to open it up after punching the holes to release the paper. Don't buy this product if you can afford to pay for a metal 7-hole punch. When my budget can afford it, I will get one myself so I don't have to use the plastic one when I'm in the office. It would be ok to use when traveling, as it is very portable and light."
3,Nice and inexpensive...,"I purchased this plant light because I have a couple of indoor plants that don't get any direct sunlight. This plant light is doing just what I expected it to do, my plants have grown at least 5 inches since I introduced them to this plant light, however, the coating on the bulb is slowly fading away, time for a new one :-)."
3,Pretty Ordinary,"I was interested in this book for the gothic plot, and while it was gothic, it was also a bit on the boring side.I didn't find Damien all that interesting a hero.I did like that Alexandra was suffering prejudice for her Jewish heritage, which is a nice and interesting quality for a romance heroine.Not very sexy or exciting though."
3,too short,"The cable works fine, but 3 feet is a little short when trying to make the connection behind the entertainment center. I had to do it without pulling the DVD player out of the cabinet. I should have bought at least a 5-ft cable. Overall, the video quality looks indistinguishable to me as connection via HDMI input."
3,A cheap attempt to cash in on the home versions of NBA Jam,"Not to say it's a bad game, but the gameplay is exactly the same as NBA Jam! It was not only published by Acclaim, but it was developed by the same people that also developed the home versions of NBA Jam. It even has the same announcer! The only differences are that instead of NBA teams, all the teams are college teams. But I digress. Similarities aside, it's not really a bad game at all."
1,Limited range with poor sound quality,The sound quality of these headphones was relatively poor but that is not why I returned them. The range was about 25 feet on the same floor and then loud static would come and go at different locations in the house. This was very consistent. In the basement they were useless. I replace them with a set by RCA model wph150 for $30 less and the sound was much better and no problem anywhere in the house.
1,"By far, The worst product I ever bought","Lets just say I'm using my [inexpensive] generic earbuds because they're much better than the Advent AW770. These things are a joke. I'm constantly adjusting the frequency on both the headphones and the transmitter at the same time, and moments after I get it to an acceptable adjustment, it fades out again to a static, which by the way is very annoying since I'm wearing the headphones and the static is just blasting in my ears! I never got this thing to work. If there were a zero on the scale, I would choose it."
5,Who could have guessed these would be so good for the price?,Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value! The headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all. I would recommend it to all my friends.
2,Blech.,"Nice long cord, only one ear, swivel cups -- those are the three things that earn this review its two stars. The quality is horrid! The music sounds like it's coming from a distance, resulting in a feeling like your ears are ready to burst. The phones themselves are not a snug fit and feel not quite right on your head. I have to personally turn my speakers WAY up just to get any sound on the phones. Not for people with sensitive hearing. Not recommended."
3,Chirping,"I found the sound quality to be quite decent, until you turn the volume up to a reasonable level. When the volume is up, it starts chirping at me. I can't hear the chirping when I plug into my stereo, so I assume it has something to do with these headphones. Has anyone else had this problem?"
5,Exellent Book for General Health,My son bought me this book about 6 months ago and since then I have been in exellent health through doing the exersises. In my present job I do not have much time to exersise so I use this book to help me maintain a healthy mind and body. I would recommend this book to anyone.
3,Korean Cinderella,"The book is about a girl name Pear blossom. After her mothers death, her fater remarried a woman who had another child with another man. Pear blossom's step-sister, Peony is ugly compared to Pear blossom. Peony's mother is jealous of Pear blossom's beauty so she makes Pear blossom do every single chore in the house. One day, The magistrate see's Pear Blossom one day but when he called her, she just ran away with one shoe. The magistrate takes the shoe and goes around trying to find the owner of the shoe. I thought this book is kind of boring because it is very similar to the other cinderella books. This book is no different then the other cinderella books."
4,Pretty art,"The author has done several books on the Cinderalla tale, and the one thing I remember most about this book was the colorful and clean art. Is paintings are bolder and darker than her 'Egyptian Cinderella', and the story is different enough to not feel like a rehash of Cinderella."
5,A talented woman of our time....,"When I first experienced Jill Scott, I thought WOW. I feel in love wit her music immediately. WIth my love and appreciation for all kinds of music, I've discovered that her music is definately SOULFUL. She came to us wit something new and different. I am soooo glad that she came out wit a new CD. Her first album was sooo great I was thristy for her next, and she came with a double disc album. On this album she took it to another level. She revealed herself, and she was REAL! If you like her style of music you will love this CD. I can't even find words used to describe this CD. All I can say is EXPERICENCE her for yourself. She is awesome, and lilke no other. This is the CD for the holidays to just relax and let her music and her voice penetrate your soul."
4,Jill just gets better and better,"Jill Scott wows us again with this semi-live twin disc album and guess what it rocks!!!I must say my personal favourites are ""Gotta get up"" and the ""Thicknesse"". Great drumming and vocals on ""Gotta get up"" just let the beats and vocals carry you. I have missed Jill's last two gigs in London due to poor publicity but I am sure when she returns to ole London she'll tear it up. Way, Way, up on many people's music list she a natural star!!!"
3,Lacking the debut's spark!,"What possesses this generation of soul divas to foist live versions of their first albums off as sophomore attempts? The ""live"" material brings nothing new to the majestic songs from ""Who Is Jill Scott"" and the studio stuff is interesting but not up to the standard set by the first album, which remains an all-time classic. Surely Scott is to be admired for her ""street cred"" and her tough talkin' stance, but as a musical artist, this effort seems more of a holding pattern than a step forward. Can't wait for the next effort from this major talent!"
3,great for the golfer,"I purchased this for a gift for my avid golfer husband. It is very well made and has lasted 2 summer seasons being outside in the elements. He doesn't get much use out of it, but I think that is just him. It is a neat concept and fun game."
5,She brought it,"This album is comparable to 2004's Confessions by Usher and 2005's Emancipation of Mimi by Mariah. There are several single wrothy songs, besides the two lead singles I love ""Get It Out Me"", ""Enjoy"" and ""Daybreak"" plus a bonus track available for download ""Roll Witchu"". I bet this will win the Grammy for best R&B album, and if it doesn't than it should have. I highly recoomend you go out and buy it, it's fun and it doesn't cost that much either. :)"
4,"Best Album since ""Velvet Rope""","I have been a Janet fan since the release of ""Control"" 20 years ago and it's good to see her back in the ""Pop"" groove once again. This is by far the best since ""Velvet Rope."" I was surprised that much of the ""explicit lyrics"" Janet has commonly used since her ""All For You"" album are gone. Not that it takes anything from the album. It's a fun album, very upbeat and reminds me alot of ""Control."" Janet definitely has it right this time!"
5,20 Y.O. is a HIT!!!,"The album is fantastic! It feels like Control meets Janet. A combo of old school and new school style. Call on Me is OK, So excited is much better, but the best singles are yet to come. I hope she promotes the album to the fullest and produces 5 or 6 videos like in the Rhythm Nation Era. Make sure you listen to track #5. AMAZING!JanFan"
2,Underwhelmed,"Unfortunately the fierce Janet Jackson of ""Control"" and ""Rhythm Nation"" and the sultry Janet Jackson of ""Janet"" and ""Velvet Rope"" have left the building. This album is average at best and Janet's creativity seems to have stalled. Jermaine Dupri's production may be great for singers like Usher and Mariah Carey who bring powerhouse vocal ability to the table. However for someone like Janet with her limited vocals the result is uninspiring. It seems like she has regressed rather than progressed and this album doesn't live up to the hype."
3,Not a great CD but look at Janet Jackson,No matter how you look at it Janet Jackson is one of the best performers of all times. This CD is not great but Janet is looking lovely as usual.
2,Good beats but not good songs,"I was disappointed by Ms. Jackson. Though it's not such a big loss b/c i didn't pay much for it. None of the songs ""jumped"" out at me. Thank god i didn't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it."
3,Nothing Stands Out From This,"It was an easy listen too, but I was annoyed. Nothing stood out. Her voice is the same but it doesn't seem to blend with the tracks laid in the back. I was not moved...and I usually could enjoy anything. There is something missing in this formula. If this cd is supposed to culminate Janet's music career thus far, it hasnt done its job. It should've just been a compilation CD.The interludes held more interest to me than anything else. They worked with her dialogue and the beats were easy to groove to. The single song I enjoyed was ""Call on Me"", but everything else was skippable.Fans of Damita Jo, prepare for disappointment. It seems rushed and lacks any life, personality, or material. This message may seem harsh, but the truth hurts. Save yourself the trouble."
1,"Jermaine Dupri sadly in ""Control"" this time","Janet has fallen considerably since the incredibly creative and original ""Velvet Rope."" It seems she has now given her boyfriend Jermaine complete control of the studio so he can destroy her career as he did Mariah Carey's (at least in the creative sense). It seems she's given up all of her ambitions from the '80s and '90s and decided to settle for anonymous cookie-cutter R&B; drivel. Granted, there are a few decent tracks (""Enjoy,"" ""Take Care,"" & the foreign bonus track ""Days Go By""), but the vast majority of the album wouldn't make the cut as filler on any of her pre-""All For You"" albums.I was a big fan of Janet's up until ""All For You,"" but she needs to get her act together... and fire Jermaine!!"
1,worst r&b singer of all time,its not some unplugged hiphop or techno stuff that belongs to the litter bin here she just hasnt made one correct record in her whole career shes not a soprano or alto she just cant modulate her singing ishriekieng &tough for the nervousystem if you like soul take dionne warwick instead if you like dance laura taylor if youre into r&b aretha franklin even if her brother stole the melody of up in the world of clifford t ward &changed it into shes out of my life he had nice career athe start with renee armand 1 day in your life toto human mature &jacksons can you feel it &i want you back shes just 906090 good for the catwalk
2,Disappointed,"I have somewhat been a fan of Janet. I really like most of her previous albums but this one I will not consider it as one of her best albums. My opinion is that she whisper or mumble most of the songs.Just about all of them are at the same tempo when it come to her vocals. It seem to me that her beats where made to try and capture the younger crowd. It sound like something that cherish,latoya,or kelis would have on their album. It was a good try but this album is not Janet at her best."
5,BLOWN AWAY BY JANET!,Naturally everyone has their own opinion about this album. Mine is that it's absolutely great. I am totally blown away by this album. I did not know exactly what to expect with this album but was not left with any regrets for getting it the minute it was released. It seems to have something to please everyone. Mostly R&B & Dance but has tracks that could most definitely crossover to Top 40 too. Overall it's fun and a definite crowd pleaser.
4,"I love the cd, but.....","was highly disappointed when it arrived yesterday only to find that the Janet cover, which I was anticipating was replaced by some bland photo (from one of the contest winners) that made it look like a bootleg. If anyone received one of these covers other than the one featured now, I'd like to know. I look at this CD as a collector's item, because who knows how long Janet's going to stretch out her career. I don't like my CD cover at all and I want the one with Janet lying down with that beautiful smile of hers. ANYONE WANT TO SELL ME THE REAL JANET CD COVER, I'LL TRADE YOU!!!!!!"
5,MAN MP ON FIRE,I have followed MP on every release he has put out. I still always seem to be amazed at how someone over comes all the hating and doubting...This man is a legend Bottom line...Living Legend is the best title he could have picked...Shut your trap is a stand out track hard core beat and Mp and krazy and black rides the hell outta the track...and couple grand is hard as hell....cookie money is a mix between icecream man and bout it bout it ....Hard as hell.....THE WHOLE ALBUM BANGING NOT A SKIP TRACK...NO FILLERS HERE....BUY IT >>>>THE TANKS ROLLING
2,Only for the truly devoted,"My expectations were admittedly high because the subject is so fascinating and the stuff of heros. It's hard to think how Arup, the colourful man, and his influential role as master architect of a new post-war approach to the built environment, could be presented in such a dull style. It doesn't quite seem right. The book is hard going and only for the most devoted. Yes there are interesting insights and anecdotes peppered around the book, but the reader has to work hard for any reward. Arup apparently had a reputation for intellectual impatience and never quite finishing his sentences before moving onto another topic. One wonders whether he would ever have finished reading this book, before moving on."
3,decent cable for a good price,"I've been using this cable for awhile and it performs well, no noise, minimal video loss. I've seen others run up over a hundred dollars and this cable will give those high priced cables a run for it's money"
1,A TOTAL waste of money!,"I purchased this device in 2010 and have used it with my Schipperke at intervals since. It hasn't had any effect what-so-ever on him, if anything he barks more. I think he likes the shock. Schipperke's are kind of schizzy anyway."
1,Would not buy again.,I would not buy this product again. You can NOT turn it off so; it looses the charge way too fast AND once you have had it on the dog they will never let you put it on again because it is zapping while you are trying to put it on. So you can never get it back on. Very bad product design.
5,innotek no bark collat,"We returned this item, only because my husband was reluctant to use it with our dog, who he adores. A friend has one and found it to be very helpful. We are hopeful out dog will just outgrow his barking - which he directs mostly to birds and squirrels in the yard."
1,Do not use !,"I placed this collar on my dog it took several barks from him then all of a sudden he yelped really loud and all 4 paws left the ground, he leaped about a foot into the air. I instantly removed the collar and had to calm him down. I never put it on him again this is not the way to train a dog it's cruelty. I felt so bad I did this to him. I sure wouldn't want 2 prongs sticking in my neck shocking me."
5,Useful device,"We're using this projector to transfer drawings to plywood, then cut the shapes out for yard decorations (after we paint them). We made several ""witch"" cutouts for the yard for halloween, but didn't have this then, so it was a long tedious chore to make them. Now we've used this for Gingerbread men cutouts for Christmas, and this saved a huge amout of time! Wish we had it a few months ago. It works very well, with no issues at all. Just find some clip art online, print it, use the projector in a darkish room to transfer, then trace the outlines with a Sharpie, and cut out with a jigsaw. Easy as pie!"
2,Enlarges Only!,"As noted by other reviewers, it gets hot fast. DO NOT use originals. Also, please note that it ENLARGES ONLY If you want to project an image to trace onto a smaller canvas, this machine cannot do it. If you want to to trace onto a same size canvas as the original, this machine cannot do it. You must reduce the image first on a scanner or copier. The focus range is also extremely limited. If you want something to ENLARGE and trace simple, non precious originals, this will work. If you want to create quality art, this is not the machine for you. Good luck!"
3,"Artograph, Inc - Tracer Projector And Enlarger REVIEW",GREAT machine! The only draw back is that you need complete darkeness (I mean complete darkness!) to see the projection.
2,Jose-NM,"First off, I don't like the smell of this product. I used it on my camp chef steel griddle one time. This griddle is great for cooking bacon and the grease trough works good. When cooking hotcakes after bacon they stick to the griddle...also we've tried to fry eggs and they break. After cleaning this griddle I just sprayed it with Pam which seemed a lot easier. But since I have retired this griddle. It is too hard to clean up and is limited to what it can cook. I have a non stick Cephalon 13 inch griddle with a handle on it that is smaller but much easier to clean and use. Also some large Non stick skillets. All much easier to use. But the large griddle is impressive looking. I don't need any more of this Cast Iron conditioner."
1,Too hard to squeeze out!,"Bought this product a few months ago, and just now tried to use it. But it's hard as a rock! Won't even squeeze out of the tube. Since it's been several months, I can't return it. I see others have had similar QC problems. I doubt I'll buy this again from Amazon...likely will shop elsewhere...for a different brand too."
3,Amazon lists it as vegan but it's not,"When I did a search for vegan lip balm this item was one of the items that came up. Well, it's not vegan, which I found out when I got it home and read the ingredients. The ingredients are not listed on Amazon either. I should have checked other sites until I found the ingredients, which is what I normally do. I think I didn't this time because I was mislead by the references to herbal, natural and organic. I have no clue if this is a good chap stick/lip balm or not and never will know b/c it's going straight into the garbage. But in order to leave this review I have to rate it. Since my issue is really with Amazon I did 3 stars.I will be contacting Amazon to ask them to not have this come up when people are looking for something vegan. I can't wait for the day when I can trust a company's description of things and not have to do so much research."
5,This Yoga book tops the list!!,"This book tops the list of Yoga books. Although Ms. Welch demonstrates Bikram Choudry's techniques, she does it 10 times better than he does in his book. The photographs of her are beautiful and inspirational. She uses clear, distinct illustrations for the poses with explanations that are easy to understand. Her personal banter about her practice pre and post was very earthy and real. I recently moved and searched high and low for her book so that I could resume my practice which I had to let lapse for a while. I was so thrilled to find her book and will treasure it forever."
3,No More Kinks,"If your body is a little tight and under a lot of stress and you need the kinks knocked out of it, this workout will do the job. Take your time and do each exercise very slow or you will pull a muscle and won't be able to move the next day. Some of the exercises were a little difficult for me because I'm a thick sister so I was able to modify some of the positions and they still worked very good. If you're determined to workout and see great results in losing weight and shaping your body, you will not be disappointed. Excellent stretches feel so good!"
4,Love Stinks,"The video was really cute and had some of my favorite Hey Arnold! episodes, but the quality of the tape was poor. It was in 6 hour mode so it wasn't as clear as on normal TV, but it was still good. The only other disappointment was that the episodes are restricted to only 1st and the beginning of 2nd season, so there was no Lila (not that that's necessarily a bad thing :) Luckily though, the Valentine episode is from 1st season so it's on there along with some other favorites. All in all, it's definitely worth the money."
3,Not really for Visual C++ 5,"This book is pretty good if you don't know anything on programming, but if you have any programming experience (say VB5 or C++ if only a little) then you are not looking for this book. It does not deliver much on WINDOWS programming, most of the examples are not Windows programs."
3,Worthy for the artwork alone,"Gaiman and McKean team up once again on yet another highly stylish, atmospheric children's offering with ""The Wolves in the Walls."" While the story is average at best lacking the originality in some of Gaiman's more imaginative offerings it still is a perfectly suitable tale to captivate the young ones. Where the book stands out, and of great aesthetic value to adults, is in Dave McKean's stellar artwork. Once again readers are treated to moody, surreal images that at times seem almost, 'too good,' for its own good. Overall this book is not quite up to par with the highest of quality we've come to expect from Gaiman & McKean but still very worthy of your time."
1,Be Careful,"I just found out this is the newer version of the leapster system and will not work with the old (and only) recharger that amazon is selling. The new recharger, available on other sites, works with this newer rectangular model and the L-max. Don't be fooled - the newer version has a smaller screen but the older version will be harder to find as leapfrog starts pushing this newer model.Check out the silver version on amazon, the only one that they sell which is the older version. The pink one is newer version as well and you will find a similar comment from someone that bought it. Amazon / Imaginarium should make it clear that the recharger on their site will only work with the silver system.Buyer beware - especially if you are hoping for free shipping and end up returning products that aren't compatible."
3,Fabulous Concept/ Screen Failure,"This is an excellent concept. My children 4-7 enjoy the various cartridges. I love that they are practicing math, reading, etc. and still enjoying it. We, however, have returned 4 Leapsters in a 12 month period due to screen failure. It is our hope that now, after another year of production, these toys are no longer failing in this manner.We find it interesting that no one else makes this comment as we have had numerous neighbors return leapsters for the same reason."
5,Leapster....Learning and Having Fun,"I bought the leapster for my five year old and he LOVES it!!!I had to get another one for my four year old,now they compete to see who gets through a challange first.It's great!!The best part is they're actually learning something instead of mindless video games.I would recommend a couple things though.Instead of buying the carring case.I find for around the same price you can get the Gameboy Advance SP case and be able to fit more cartridges in it.The Leapster fits in it perfectly and it has straps for the little ones to carry it around better.It also doesn't fall out when they open it like the Leapster case does.I would also recommend getting the recharger since if your kids are like mine they'll drain the batteries out fast.They play all day and put it on the station at night for a full charge.This is well worth the money!"
1,leapster,"well i am 11 years old in ca well this product sucks. i would rather get the color pixter or the iQuest. first i was begging for this but the reviews and the editors review really turned me off. a other thing is that someone said they got the ""leapster"" instead of the pixter. well they said the pixter didn't have education well thats why there is cartiges for the desired game or any thing you would like. about the i quest it is tight. it prepares us, kids, for test or anything like that. after checking its editors review i saw it was better that the leapster , which i wanted first. it would help me better than this junk becausewgich would not have all the information that we need. like contrast the iquest has the mostly allthe information of the text books in schools and when you type the title of the text book it will tell you information. as well as preparing for the big test in spring. ;) bye thanx."
2,My leapster didn't last a year,The leapster I bought my son did not last through the year. It broke after about 7 months. I have tried repeatedly to contact customer service just to see if I can get it fixed. I know it's not still under warranty and I have no idea where the receipt is at this point. I have spent at least half an hour on the phone several days in a row trying to get through at Leapster. Disappointing at best.
5,best ever,I bought the leapster for my 5 year old daughter. she loves it!!!!! Not only does my 5 year old love it but my 10 and 11 year old kids love it too. It is kind of like an educational gameboy.
1,THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!,"THE ITEM WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I WAS EXPECTING! ITS DIRTY, EVEN THE BAG IT CAME IN WAS DIRTY!! THE BACK WERE THE BATTERIES GO HAS RUST AND IT WONT TURN ON!! THERE'S SCRATCHES ALL OVER ... I MEAN THE LIST JUST GOES ON!!"
1,90 day warranties are all you need to know about this crap,Leapster products are absolute crap and most die within weeks of the end of the extremely short warranty period. Ours died about 4 days after the warranty was up and I know many others who have had similar experiences. Do yourself a favor and steer very clear of these products and the lousy unethical company that sells them.
3,screen disappointment,The idea is great but the problems are too. This is the second leapster we've had and it still has problems with the screen calibration! I've contacted Leap Frog and they allowed me to return it and get another one but SAME problem! This is very frustrating! We've purchased three other cartridges and at the cost of these and the product....what a rip off!
3,We can't get one that works.,"My daughter loves the Leapster, when it works. I purchased one for her birthday and after one a month the touch screen no longer responded to touch. I sent it back via UPS and I purchased a second one today July 27, 2004 with the $76 I received due to the extended warranty. We took it home and my daughter couln't wait. Low and behold, the new one doesn't work at all! I can't even get it to calibrate! I am very frustrated with Leap Frog. I will be back at the store tomorrow and I will try to talk my daughter out of purchasing a new one at all! How disappointing."
5,Excellent and educational,This was a great gift for my kids; it entertains them for a long time and is better than the gameboy. Especially for my daughter who loves to draw and color books.
1,BUYER BEWARE- THE DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY,"Within the first week of purchase of this product the stylus went bad. The retail store would not exchange so we had to call leap frog. Leap frog was unwilling to replace the stylus contrary to the terms of their warranty and i understood that after 3 seperate calls to them to representatives that had a hard time grasping the englisdh language. I guess they too outsource their customr service center to some country on the other side of the world. Needless to say, we will never purchase any product again from this company."
4,Some on the go worthwhile fun.,"I bought this system because my boy's 20 year old cousin lent him a Gameboy while we were taking care of my elderly Mothers business and it kept tears away.My 5 year old boy enjoys computer games. This one keeps his attention and is more informative than his rollar coaster tycoon, F1 or Dirt bike racing games. He is not fond of the preloaded; abc-123 frogger type game, but enjoys the artist game. Which is kinda strange as he does not enjoy manual coloring or drawing much.It is a hand held system and a blessing during long waits with Grandma at the Doctors. He likes taking it in the car. The downside is we don't discuss scenery or sing out loud together when its in the car. I've bought the Kindergarten game to try out on a 1000 mile road trip soon.Another friend has his child stay quiet in his room playing with Leapster until the parents get up in the morning. Not a bad Saturday AM idea."
3,It's ok.,"I got this for my 5 year old son for Christmas. He really likes video games so I figured he would enjoy this. I can't say that he would rather play this than our PS2, but he has been reaching for it every now and then. My main complaint is the poor quality of graphics in the games. The games are so expensive, and the graphics are so crappy! Also, this unit can get heavy for little hands. I bought my oldest son a Nintendo DS for Christmas, and that thing blows this Leapster out of the water. I guess you really do get what you pay for! My best word of advice is, try to find the games sold in groups on eBay or something. They are just not worth the retail price."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"I am so disappointed in Leapfrog! We purchased the pink leapster for my daughter for her birthday and it doesn't even work. I don't know how on earth this product made it past Leapfrog's quality assurance team... or should I say what quality assurance?Leapfrog cannot even warranty their product because they don't carry the pink ones. All they can do is send a replacement one in a different color. That didn't work with my 4 year old that wanted pink and got one for her birthday. So, we are having to pay double the shipping to return the defective product and pay the shipping for the new one.The most frustrating thing is that this isn't the first Leapfrog product we have had to return that was defective. We also had to return the letter magnets because they wouldn't recognize the correct letter. NOW THAT'S EDUCATIONAL.We won't be purchasing any more Leapfrog products because their quality assurance is sub-par."
2,stopped working after 5 days,Christmas gift and it already quit.looked on the back and it said MADE IN CHINA...That explains it
1,these drop like flies,"between my daughter and my niece, they've been through 3 of these. 2 of them had lines going down the screen before they were a year old, and all of them totally stopped working and don't even turn on. I contacted Leapfrog and they said if it's a year old and/or I have no proof of purchase, they can't do anything about it but told me I could purchase a new one on their website. I guess they don't care that they have a crappy product, as long as they're making money."
2,fun but NOT sturdy,"We purchased this or my son's 4th birthday. It lasted about 4 mos. and then wouldn't start up anymore. We did all the tricks (cleaning the battery connections, yadda yadda and it will won't start up. Now the warranty is void because it's been past 3 mos. However, my daughter has the pink one and hers is still working but hers is only 2 mos. old...we'll see how long hers lasts. My son is incredibly disappointed that his is broken and that his sister's still works. His older brother has a Nintendo DS and he's much more interested in that anyway so I won't be replacing the leapster."
1,Beware of age range,"I ordered this because it said 4-10yrs in the description, even the picture of the package shown on Amazon says 4-10yrs but the box I received says 4-8. So I went to Toys R Us and they had boxes with both age ranges. I am not sure if Leapster changed the age range or if this product has two different age ranges. But I was looking for something that would be appropriate for 8-10 age range. Since I purchased it as a Christmas present I can not rate the toy itself at this time."
4,Highly recommend a replacement plan,"This is an excellent toy, however, the touch-screen durability leaves a lot to be desired. There have been 4 Leapsters in my house in the past 18 months.I purchased the first for my 4-year-old. That one crapped out less than a month after purchase, so I took it back to the store. The second was covered by a replacement plan. After the second one died, I called the replacement-plan administators who instructed me to send the game to them. Three weeks later, I had a check for the replacement.I finally replaced that one and to top it off, I also had to purchase another for my 2-year-old. In total, my house has seen 4 leapsters.I strongly encourage one to purchase the replacement plan. $15 extra in the beginning saved me $140 on game consoles and over $200 worth of games that would have been rendered useless. Imagine those numbers now times 2.This is no exaggeration."
4,Almost Perfect,"The little girl that I bought this game for just turned 3 and she loved it! Her parents had to limit the time she used it because they couldn't get her to stop playing with it. She knows everything that this game will do in just a couple of weeks and she's much better at it than the adults. However, it stopped working just two weeks after she got it. Her parents replaced it with a Leapster II and she's at it again!! Excellent learning game for even small children."
2,No headset jack!,"What is this, 1972? I thought ALL cordless phones nowadays had a headset jack. I can't walk around with my HAND holding the phone to my head. Or worse yet, cramping my neck muscles to hold it between shoulder and head. What are we, barbarians?I always wear a headset because I need my hands free to pet my rabbits, type on the computer, wash the dishes -- you know, life.Sound quality was better than my old Uniden, but still not very good. There's a simple switch to turn the ringer off (that's what made me impulse-buy it at Walgreens store).I can't tell you anything else about the phone, as I only used it for 5 minutes before discovering the ""no jack"" problem and packing back up to return to store.I'm going for a new DECT phone. They seem like they might have decent sound quality. Message playback audio quality has been quite poor in the Uniden phones I've had."
2,"Cheap, but not really.","I have to say, even given the price, I am disappointed in this phone. I selected it because I needed an answering machine, figuring it would be sufficient for my needs. It's junk. the phone is almost useless, for any call over 1 mile, and the machine is worse. It shows new messages, I play them, they are 3 days old...but never showed when they came in. the answering machine volume must be at the very top, blasting, or I can't even hear my messages...I seriously considered returning it, but there are very few choices, and I am in the middle of moving out of state. I'll probably just junk it when I move."
4,"Very Good, Reliable, Simple to use Telephone","I like the size and shape of this phone. It has a good answering machine, and is simple to set up, and a great value for the price."
3,"A good supplement, but hardly all-inclusive.","I agree with another reviewer, that this isn't a CD for someone who has never learned French before. I'm not sure how the authors picked some of the topics, as many don't appear to be relevant to traveling, and just presents one part of a conversation -such as ordering a steak rare or well done, but nothing on ordering chicken or how to say medium. I don't think anyone could ""learn"" French from the CD alone. One might learn enough to get by, but that would include multiple hours of listening, following the mini-guide, and maybe doing some writing.On the positive side, it's fun to listen to and the accents are native. I learned some basic phrases such as greetings, asking for things, and polite things to say. The CD stresses pronounciation, so it may be something someone used in conjunction to a class or another method of study."
2,Only good for showmen...,"If you're only interested in Satanic ideology, don't buy this. This is only for those interested in the symbolism of religion."
5,"The ""Black"" Bible",This book is wonderful for those just getting started with or who want to learn more about The Church of Satan. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
4,Its not for everybody....,...of course Satanism isn't for everybody. This book ties up a few loose ends from the original Bible. It has lifted the scales from my eyes after disposing his first book and denying his philosophy which originally led me into despair. Written in 1974 it still can be very useful. La Vey's philosophy personifies self-sufficiency in the man animal which seeks to dominate his species.
2,A Capella album - I've heard better..,"I first heard the Bobs on the Harry Shearer show. Specifically, it was the ""Slow Down, Krishna"" song. It really reminded me of Moxy Früvous. However, the album itself was disappointing. There were a couple witty songs, a very good cover of Paul Simon's The Boxer, and the rest put me to sleep.If you have heard the Bobs before and have some sort of an emotional attachment to them (hearing them live, perhaps), this album might be ok for you. It wasn't for me, although occasionally I'll still listen to the tale of a Hari Krishna who spent his sect's cash on a red trans-am.."
3,Overpriced for what you get.,"Not a bad book, but not a great one either. Does simplify the rather dense instructions for using the camera given in the user's manual that comes with the Nikon 5700 and offers in six of the eight chapters a primer on photography touching upon such topics as exposure, light & color, lenses, and close-up photography. Spiral binding makes the book easy to handle. CD included was of no interest to me, although it does reproduce the book as an e-book in a colored version. Would have preferred to have the book I bought in color and skip the CD."
1,Not worth the price!,"In my opinion, a poor quality product overall. Content is inadequate (and repetitive). Monochrome print version is cheap. CD color version is garish and poorly illustrated. It is not a course at all. Even these days, US$30 can still buy you a nicely laid out, edited and produced book on photography with good quality content and illustrations. Not this one!"
4,Perfect for its design,"This product is one of the best ways to get a tablet monitor without paying the price for the wacom cintiqs and other similar products. It's very easy to maneuver, has good response time, and is perfect for graphic design, photo manipulation, or even basic computer interactivity. Highly recommended. The only catch is that the stylus does use batteries. It also seems as if these type of things don't exist anymore. If you're a designer on a budget, this is an awesome product."
1,"Boring, dull, disappointing","What a disappointment after that unforgettable love story, ""Correlli's Mandolin."" Coming to de Bernieres' first novel, I was filled with expectation: of the breathtaking descriptions of landscape, the sly and trenchant examinations of politics, the painfully, beautfully detailed events of characters' lives which seem to forge their own meaning. Instead, I found a dull collection of ""wacky"" and gruesome vignettes. Instead of characters, we have carboard cutouts. Instead of subversive thought, we have plain ideology. Instead of true invention, we have unfocussed experimentation. And instead of a story, we have a plot. A bruising disappointment for a huge fan."
1,this product is a waste of money it's not worth it,this product is a total waste of money I wouldn't even buy this product for my kids that's how bad it is I can't take any pictures at all or make any videos so if any one buy this camera just know that you are wasting your money
4,Feeding the rush to steal stuff.,"Here's the plot- some cool criminals in a not too distant future industrial London steal cars, only to drive them into posh shopping malls to loot what they can before hearing police sirens, basically for the rush- wicked. This debut from PAUL ANDERSON (EVENT HORIZON) is a nifty little film that manages to exite in it's short running time. Gritty and well acted by some up and comming English talent (SEAN PERTWEE is excellent as usual as a tough scumbag), this flick has some slick production for an indie. A movie that looks good, moves with purpose, and draws the viewer into a world of grime and crime is always worth it."
5,Love Van Damme,"These are two terrific films and great value for the money. Nowhere to run is an excellent film with Rosanna Arquette as JCVD's co-star. Desert Heat has lots of action and mysticism. If you like action films and you like Van Damme, you'll love both of these. I highly recommend them to all hard-core action fans."
3,A lot remains to be desired...,"An interesting collection of essays by different historians,this book does an excellent job of introducing the beginning university student to a number of issues related to Stalinism and historical methodology(somehow unconsciously);however,the lack of footnotes/endnotes makes this undertaking less credible and useful for more advanced readers."
3,Great game but a problem,"I got this game a long time ago and I love it. But the only problem is that after a week it stops working and my cats were just pregnant.If you are a person that cries after there favorite games stopes working, then don't buy this."
5,My Favorite Petz,"I purchased this game for my 13 year old daughter and it has provided her with hours!!!! of entertainment. We live on a farm and she really enjoys playing with the ""live"" animals. But on days when the weather is bad and she can't be outside, I can hear the realistic barking and meowing from the computer. She has so many petz that she has to ask me to help think of new names for them. Thank you for such a great product!"
5,great!,this game is the coolest game!!! I love it so much you can adopt as many animals as you want! it is great for any great animal lover!
1,They're Baaaaack...Unfortunately,"This is by far one of the worst PC games I've ever played!If you've played the previous Dogz and Catz games, this one is NO DIFFERENT.No word can describe how aweful these graphics are. They are not in 3-D and the Petz look nothing like the real thing.The framerate of this game is probably one of the worst things in the game. Slow and annoying.You can't pick the gender of your Petz.You can also have your Petz run around the desktop. WOW!Your options are VERY LIMITED.Overall: This is not only one of the worst PC games, this is one of the worst video games ever! Stay far away from this game! 1 out of 5 stars."
1,Boring!,"I have not played this game, but from seeing my sister play it, it seems boring! All it is is that you have pets that just make noise.BBBBBBOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIIINNNNGGGG!"
1,Cool Headphones,The are very good headphones for your money. They have a little bit of static at the maximum range but it still sound pretty good.
3,"Pricey, but functional","This is a quality RJ 45 to DB9 adapter, the only issue is the price. No way this is worth what they charge, but if you need one it gets the job done. Would've given a 4 star, if not for the price."
3,It is okay,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews about this book. It starts with the teachings and then goes into the practice. The teaching portion is pretty good telling you how to be a Samurai. The practice portion is very vague. A person would really have to know the techniques in order to perform the katas. I studied Eishin Ryu for a while is the reason I know some of the waza's but, seeing how these techniques are in the book I could get lost nevermind the beginner.This is a good book to add to your library for conversation. Maybe! But I would not buy this bokk if I was just starting out with never picking up a katana.If you do want to purchase this book I would go to used and new books for sale tabs to find a very cheap one."
3,A Good Groundwork for approaching questionable Science,"This book by Mr. Gardner has its good and bad points. First of all, on the negative side, it is quite dated. Most of the people and theories in the book have long since died and are totally unknown to most of today's readers. After all, this edition was published in 1957. What was news back in the late '40's and early '50's may not even be considered history today, L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetics being the main exception. Nonetheless, Mr. Gardner has the right idea: Peer Review. That is the best way to spot charlatans and crackpots. If someone's ideas, novel or not, cannot stand up to the scrutiny of experts in that field, then, almost always, the theory is worthless. I recommend this book for those that might be interested in a recent history of mountebanks."
2,Automatic Switchbox NOT automatic,I have been using this product for several months with Windows XP machines. It will not automatically switch from one computer-to-printer connection to another. I always have to manually switch it. I have found no documentation or trouble shooting information on this product anywhere on the internet. It works fine as a manual switcher.
3,Overall a nice machine--except for the fan noise,"I've had this laptop for about 4 months now, and the overall performance has been as expected for a Pentium 4 machine.One serious downside though is the fan noise. For some reason I expect laptops to be quiet, but this one is not. The fan runs constantly, and is quite loud. I suppose this is necessary when using all the capabilities of the P4, but for normal web surfing and such ""light duty"" tasks, it is not. I think HP could have designed in a smarter fan speed controller, so that it only sounds like a vacuum cleaner when the CPU is really getting a workout (gaming and such). I feel it was a cop out on the part of the HP designers not to include a smarter fan speed controller.Other than that, I think it's one of the best values out there. The display is great, as is the built-in numeric keypad, and the included software can't be beat."
1,GE Cordless,These phones are not very good. They started to die very quickly just a few months after use. Don't recommend.
3,Single Line Phone...,"The answering machine is good, the sound is clear. Only one flaw in this Phone you can not use both phones at the same time. Thanks!"
2,Not a great phone at all.,"The sound is distorted and background really shines through making it dificult to have a pleasant conversation. There is a convenience factor of having two handsets, but a few dollars more would buy better quality."
3,LOW END,"THIS PHONE HAS BASIC FEATURES AND IS WORTH THE MONEY. BUT I HAVE PROBLEMS ""LOSING"" MESSAGES. LETS SAY YOU ARE SCREENING YOUR CALLS AND YOU HEAR YOUR FRIEND LEAVE A MESSAGE, THE LED SAYS 1 MESSAGE, YOU PUSH PLAY AND YOU GET TO HEAR A MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE WHO HAD CALLED EARLIER. NOW YOU WAIT, YOU RECEIVE A NEW CALL AND THEY LEAVE A MESSAGE, BUT WHEN YOU PUSH PLAY, YOU GET TO HEAR THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE YOUR FRIEND LEFT. LOL I CALLED AND WAS TOLD THAT SOMETIMES THE DIGITAL RECORDER NEEDS TO BE RESET, SO YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG AND RE-PLUG YOUR PHONE. THIS IS ONLY 3 WEEKS OLD...."
4,Great fun cooking with your kids,"I bought this book some time ago when my stepson took an interest in cooking. There are alot of great recipes that will get your child excited to create. Some are a little involved, but are good rainy day cooking projects."
1,Obsolete Piece of Software,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ALREADY OWN BEYOND THE SWORD! All the core game changes, including wonders and civilizations, are included in Beyond the Sword. Only get this game if you want to have the scenarios that were included in Warlords."
5,A Necessary Expansion,"Civilization IV is great, and Civilization IV: Warlords makes it even better.It adds 6 very good civilizations: the Carthagian empire, Celtic empire, Korean empire, Ottoman empire, Viking empire, and the Zulu empire.The new leaders in this game are Hannibal, Brennus, Wang Kon, Mehmed II, Ragnar, Shaka, Winston Churchill, Augustus Caesar, Ramesses II, and Josef Stalin.In addtion it also includes several more amazing scenarios, new buildings, 3 new leader traits, and the very helpful 'Warlord' unit.This expansion adds many more ways to enjoy the Sid Meier's Civilization series, and is a wonderful thing to have."
5,Sweetness,I must say I enjoyed this expansion pack a lot in filling in a lot more gaps that seemed to of been sitting in the game when I bought it. I do enjoy the additions of races and more complexity to building various things and working towards a specific goal. A+
2,A mediocre expansion,"While CIV IV is an excellent game the expansions are not so great. Sure the added content is always nice and the new game play really makes for an interesting and fresh take. But the increase in the AI cheating is just too much. What a shame because I would recommend CIV IV to anyone, it is just that good of a game, these expansions take it down a notch."
2,Hated the end,I liked this whole book except the end which I think is the most important part of a book.Also the main character who I absolutly dispised. I thought Nerilka seemed like a self centered brat towards the end of this book. She could be a little more humble.
3,Mediocre,"This book covers the same events as 'moreta' from the perspective of Lord Tolocamp's daughter Nerilka. You'll want to red this to complete your Pern experience, but it isn't one of the better Pern Novels. This book assumes some knowledge of the events in 'Moreta', so I'd recommend reading it first to lessen possible confusion."
4,fun book,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
5,dead leaves is asume :) :),i liked it great way to show how a comic book can come to life i encuege you to buy it from jackdistaso thx. :) :) :)
2,Rakeing leaves is more fun,Full tv screen mode with no viewing options. So you get black bars on the left and right.I haven't watched the whole thing yet. I can't. I'd rather watch the black bars. The whole thing looks like crud. It tries too hard to be bright and loud.Nudity?? no. if it is in there it looks like crud. don't get exited my fellow depraveos. the vid isn't as good as the pic on the box. false advertiseing
2,"A great idea, but...","I bought two of these kits at a closeout sale because they looked interesting. Inside each rod is a piece of electroluminescent wire that glows a pale blue, and no matter what color rod one uses, it is still a shade of blue. That's fine, because all EL wire has a bluish look. The problem with this kit is that the connector balls are very cheaply made and the barrel-type jacks and plugs don't make solid electrical or mechanical connections. If they had used 1/16"" phono plugs and larger balls with tighter jacks and a better quality of plastic, they would have had a first class product. It is a fascinating product that could have been better made, but I certainly would not recommend this for children liable to put the small pieces into their mouths."
2,Packing FIXED! Order from Amazon (MAYBE NOT: SEE UPDATE),"I just received this battery just a couple days after ordering it. It was shipped in a double walled cardboard box with extra cardboard on the sides. The only problem I would say is that one of the cut-out ""handles"" had ripped through.However the battery was very well protected and I would say at this point at least in my experience the packaging problems have been solved - order away.I can't comment too much yet on the battery - just installed it in my boat this weekend. Most people coming here already know about this battery, so I'm focusing on the major complaint thus far - the packing.I ordered a second optima battery that hasn't yet arrived. this one arrived in 2 days! We'll see when that one comes if it was packed the same way.UPDATE: got my second battery and was in single cardboard box with small amount of plastic - it's cracked and unusable. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Would NOT recommend ordering at this point. 5 stars just went to 2 stars."
4,Optima Bluetop battery,This item arrived damaged due to faulty packing job. I called Amazon and they promptly replaced the unit with no delays. Great customer service if you ask me.This is my 3rd Optima battery and I use it in my bass boat. It is very reliable and lasts a long time.
2,blah,"Mixing the cliches of romance with the cliches of preternatural stories results in a flat, boring story that has none of the chicklit humour of MaryJanice Davidson or Katie MacAlister. Not worth the time or attention."
5,freaking amazing,"it was very reaxing, loved the visauls, i got friends that would love it. would reccommend to people who like trippy stuff."
2,Go for something a little better.,"I found the fujifilm camera takes mediocre pictures. The flash always seemed too bright, which always made the subject too light and the background too dark. Outside was the only time I got a good picture and that was rare. Inside, without the flash, you get a blurry picture. I honestly got better pictures from a disposable camera than with this digital camera.It might've just been my luck, but I also lost 5 memory cards to this camera. Every once in awhile, I'd turn my camera on and the screen would read ""card error"". All my pictures were erased and the card became useless."
3,At least I didn't pay for it,"I got this camera as a gift. At first I was really happy to finally have a digital camera. Then I found the power mechanism to be inconvenient. Even if I put it in a case it can open by itself, which drowns the batteries. Also, when taking pictures at night or a dimly lit room, the picture comes out looking like ""someone on acid"" I don't like it at all. I've missed so many photo opportunities because of this fault. I am currently looking for a new camera with NIGHT vision being on the top of the list.Overall, it's ok. Battery life is fine and it takes decent pics."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Both of my daughters received Leapsters from Santa last year. My older one wanted a red one and my younger a pink one. The red one was an L-Max and this was the only pink one. I believe they now have a pink L-Max, but in my opinion spending the extra money on the L-Max isn't worth it. The only difference is you can hook it up to the tv, which we've never done because the whole fun of the Leapster for my girls is that they can take it anywhere. I was worried that the L-Max games wouldn't work on the ""plain"" Leapster, but that is not the case. All of the games are interchangable. However, you can't play a non-L-Max game on the tv, which again, doesn't matter to us anyway.Also, I wouldn't bother buying the recharging station. We just use rechargable batteries and they work just fine."
2,"DO SOME RESEARCH, BEFORE YOU DECIDE !!!","This is an 'older' system version from Leapfrog.Why buy these,... when you can getLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System (Green)or theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Green. The Leapster 2 is a more recent version of the system displayed here. While the Leapster Explorer is the MOST recent system from LeapFrog. The Leapster and the Explorer use diferent type cartridges. Check them out before you decide."
3,"good toy, but for learning Leappad is way better...and more fun","This toy is good. The graphics are good, but compared to Leappad it looks like nintendo...maybe super nintendo. It is a great first video game system and does have basics for toddlers like learning letters. I prefer Leappad as it has far more learning in it, but Leapster is geared toward toddlers, where Leappad was perfect for my 3 year old as she is learning things in the 4 yr + range. It's really depending on what skill level your child is at. Same price as Leappad"
3,Have already broken two,"My 4 1/2 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift from Santa. By the 26th, the stylus pen no longer worked on the screen. When I tried to go through the screen calibration instructions, the screen would read ""Touch the center of the target,"" but there was no target on the screen. I returned it to the store later that week for a new Leapster.She plays with the games constantly and I've seen a huge jump in her interest for adding numbers, writing letters, and pre-reading skill, which I love. Unfortunately, three weeks later, the second unit has broken again - with the same problem! I will exchange it for another unit again, because I definitely see the educational benefits, but I would have expected greater durability for a toy geared towards 4 year olds."
5,Fun and educative. A good tool for EFL.,"We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter as a support to learn english as a foreign language, and she loves it. The pink/purple color makes the whole idea appealing to girls, too.The activities are both educative and fun. They fit well with our EFL purpose. And with the 3 different levels the games should last a few years.For more diversity I recommend ""1st grade""."
4,Is there a perfect dog?,"While the professional reviewers might ""pan"" this particular short book, I would like to ""pick"" it.Shiebler presents the many dogs he has known with a heart touching poignancy. The dogs who shared his life are real, live, furry, and sometimes slobbery, to use his own adjective.As happens in life, many of he dogs Shiebler has known have died. Bring tissues. At least a dozen - or a couple of good strong cotton handkerchiefs - you will need them.If you know anyone who swears ""I never cry over stories"", bet them that A Search for the Perfect Dog will ruin their record. Provide tissues for them!"
4,A Rare Gem,"For those who love all things Firesign- especially their early material- Waiting for the Electrician is indispensible. While not as polished or comically insane as some of their later releases, this one contains many seeds of genius.I've always felt that Firesign Theatre deserved far more recognition they've received. Anyone who thinks America had nothing to rival Monty Python would do well to check out any of Firesign's material from the 60's and 70's. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great commentaries (contains spoilers),"When I first heard this film was being made and that Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant were going to be in it, I thought, ""Yes! Hugh Grant as Willoughby and Emma Thompson as the unpleasant sister-in-law!"" But no. However, the commentaries explain the casting and then it made more sense. By the way, Kate Winslet is perfect and Alan Rickman gets the girl."
3,I like the other one better,"I know this one is closer to the book, but I still like the other movie version better. I like the actors that played the characters better and the story, while not perfectly true to the book, was wonderful. I was disappointed with Hugh Grant as Frederick. He was too simpering for my taste. Looked stiff in his cravat."
2,Sense and Sensibility,Dear Srs.I have not receive the product. Do you to know when I am going to receive this product. After that I can write my review.
5,Two thumbs up! I loved the movie. Gracie from Waco.,"I enjoy watching the movie everytime it comes out. I've gone as far as recording the movie because I cannot find it in the stores. Way to go, Kate!"
3,Predictable,"The movie was very predictable.I think the story was great, but the cast didn't seem appropriate for the movie. Just have seen them in too many other movies. Their characters weren't believable."
5,Altogether wonderful,"Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant--what more do I have to say? Thompson created a great screenplay of Jane Austin's wonderful sister story. Super acting, great scenery, terrific characterizations. This is a most satisfying version of the story. Hooray!"
4,"it is brown and pink, not black","perhaps I didn't read the fine print, but the stripes are chocolate brown not black."
2,Nice ... when it actually works,"If only I could go back and do it all over again, Samsung would not get a dime from me. I've had to send this in to be repaired 3 times, all at my shipping expense. First off, when you load files into this player, older files will vanish. The player will still list them, but try and play them and your player will tell you ""no entry"". As if this were not frustrating enough, the player decides to shut off on it's own, and once off, will turn itself on again, going off and on repeatedly. The only way to stop it is to pull the battery out. Calling Samsung and complaining only amounts to having to send the player in to be repaired over and over. If the player actually worked, this would be a fantastic MP3 Player. I feel ignored by Samsung, and will not spend another dime on any of their products."
2,Don't sweat it!,"If you are planning on using this mp3 player to workout, get something else. I got a little sweat on mine and it quit working."
4,Thank Heaven!,"Thank Heaven for DVD! I feel like I am seeing this movie in the theater. I have loved it since I was little, but missed some of the plot at the time- so if you are seeing this later as an adult be prepared for some dated sexual politics. Other than that, great movie- great music, great costumes, great actors in wonderful color!!!"
3,Disappointing DVD version,"GiGi is a timeless story that deserves better than it's given with this DVD edition from Warner. Most of the advantages and improvements available to the DVD format are ignored with this release - no widescreen format, no Dolby, no extras, etc...I bought this sight unseen, and regret it. I am already on the hunt for the MGM version which has most of the enhancements that make DVD such a pleasure."
2,"Great movie, poorly reproduced DVD","If you want a copy of Gigi because you love the film, this is the only version available. What a shame. It was produced from a print with bobs and scratches and blurry colors and on occasion, focus. There are no special features, as with other major MGM musicals. The score is enchanting as are the performances. This is not a DVD to own, rent it, and wait for the studio to put out a restored version, whenever that may be."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I have loved this movie since I was a little girl! Maurice Chevalier reminded me of my grandfather. My hubby bought me the DVD and I seriously put the movie on at least once a week! The music is wonderful and it's such a clever and witty story! The characters are all so loveable, especially Gigi. Leslie Carron delivers such a fantastic performance, along with the entire cast that it's so easy to see why it won the oscar for best picture in 1958!"
1,Why is anyone bothering?,"Bought it because wife saw it in formative years and wasn't able to resist her importunings to buy it for her. It's cheaper than a new car, but I wouldn't anticipate ever actually watching it. With any luck, it will be buried among other stuff she has to do and forgotten. Obviously, can't give learned disquisition on its finer? points, don't care if you buy it or not."
5,Spectacular blu-ray,"The blu-ray of Gigi is a spectacularly beautiful job. The reds in Gigi's apartment almost overwhelm you. The beautiful pastels of the women's clothing are perfect, the blacks are deep and inky. I found no visible grain in the picture. My only real disappointment was that the Dolby-TrueHD soundtrack was pretty much all centered in the front speakers. There was very little surround to it, but after all, the source was not surround to begin with.The extras area decent with a couple of commentaries and a half hour documentary about the making of the film, going over the casting, problems with the filming in Paris and the Hayes code restrictions and getting around them. A documentary short and a Tom and Jerry cartoon round out the extras, plus a theatrical trailer for the movie.Gigi is a classic movie that has a beautiful release on blu-ray with this disc."
4,"Great book, fair reprint","I must say that Kolmogorov is one of my favorite Russian scientists and scientific writers (the others are Arnol'd, Gel'fand and Landau). His approach over real and functional analysis is superb. But I have a serious complaint: why did Dover choose the old and dated Graylock edition to reprint this masterpiece? The most recent Russian edition has a lot of other important topics (missing in Dover's reprint), such as differential calculus in Banach spaces, which is so difficult to find a decent treatment of. The organization of the book is also better in the Russian edition. A good revised and translated reprint of it would deserve not five, but six, seven, ten stars..."
2,Would not do business with this company again,I bought two sets of dumbbells from this company and I think they are nice but I would not order from this company again. Took forever for them to arrive and I had to email and try and contact both Amazon and the company that sold the dummbells to see where they were and if I was ever gonna get the items I purchased. Horrible service and ordering with this company. I am greatly dissatosfied with this company and how they handle ordering and shipping of products.
2,Sweethearts,"I was disapointed in the quality of the video. The movie was cropped on the right side removing that portion of the picture. I know that portion of the film exists as I have viewed it on Youtube. Also the cassette itself was broken. The part of the cassette that protects the tape was broken on one side. I was lucky to have an old cassette so I was able to replace the broken part from that cassette. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a purchase. The VHS should NOT have been rated as ""Like New""."
5,The Beautiful MacEddys,"I was only a child, a very young child,perhaps six or seven, when I first saw the Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy movie, Naughty Marietta. Although i didn't understand the film's plot, I was enchanted by the two stars. When I recently saw the movie again, I understood why I was so enchanted as a child. The love between Jeanette and Nelson as they sang was transmitted right into the audience and into the heart of that six or seven-year child. I was orphaned soon after and suffered many years in an abusive family, but the emotional memory of that film was like an inner candle helping me to survive and remember that there is such a thing as love."
2,Talk about [typical]!,"He decides to make her ""his woman"", orders her to move in with him then proceeds to completely control her life. Treats her like a toy to bring out & play with when he wants. He won't allow her to do anything, just expects her to sit around all day waiting for him. He takes over running her ranch & thinks she's too stupid to even do his books! And maybe she is, as she's dumb enough to put up with it!I love Linda Howard but this book was not a keeper!"
3,Not all that great...disappointing....,"I have been a loyal fan of Linda Howard's for a long time, and this is definitely not one of her better ones! The Mackenize series is the best route to go, if this is your first time reading any of her books. The series is wonderful, I loved her Wolf and Mary characters, reading about their children was a real treat. If you love suspense, try Now You See Her, also good.I cannot wait for Dying to Please in April."
2,Not overly impressed,"Like the reader from Houston, I was not overly impressed with this book, especially at that price. Many of the recipes included ingredients such as ""1 jar spaghetti sauce"". Couldn't that thorough research have provided a clue as to the size of the jar? And then, the Chicken Ole and the Chicken Piquante seemed remarkably similar to me(although the Piquante doesn't call for mustard in the ingredients but does in the first sentence of instruction)but the nutrition information varied! In other words, it was OK, but just."
2,Could be better.,"Matt Braun is usually known for stories rich with historic detail and realism. This book reads more like the movie ""Tombstone"" (a great movie on its own) and lacks that historical bite. He has a different take on Wyatt Earp than many, which is OK, in that he doesn't place him on the pedestal that most others place him. It's fairly obvious, from other references to Wyatt and his brothers, that he doesn't hold them in very high regard.(Especially in his Luke Starbuck novel ""Tombstone"") In this story the characters seem to be written as cliches of themselves and the lack of insight to their characters makes it hard to feel for them and become involved in the story. From an author who was able to effectively portray John Wesley Hardin as a ""Noble Outlaw"", I guess I expected more."
3,CONCERT NOT TOO BAD,"I read a few reviews and decided to purchase this DVD. The sound is pretty good in 5.1 surround. As others mention, a whole concert shot at one venue would have been better. Instead, they have clipped multiple concerts together and formed them into one DVD. You may as well hold on tight, so you don't get dizzy watching the girls' outfits change in every shot and on every angle. In all, great sound, but very cheaply done. It turned out more like a cheesy one hour video. The girls are great anddeserve a better DVD. Just a full concert next time...no dubs and multiple venues."
2,What a Letdown!,"Let me begin by saying that I love the Dixie Chicks and was eagerly anticipating their second DVD. I found their first release, ""An Evening With The Dixie Chicks"", to be sensational. But the ""Top of the World Tour"" DVD is something else. My main complaint is that each song is completely disjointed because each one uses multiple clips from several different 2003 concerts, and every few seconds, the Chicks are wearing different outfits and and are performing in different locales. At no point do you get the nice homey (pardon the pun) feeling of watching a song performed at one venue. The new punky look of Natalie and the girls didn't thrill me either, but that's another story. Two stars is all this DVD deserves."
3,Better Without the Trick Editing,A live concert should be a captured moment. It is an expression of how a band sounds at a given time. Unfortunately this DVD does not represent the Dixie Chicks at a given moment of their Top of the World Tour. It is a mish mash culled from up to ten performances and then edited together with venue changes occurring about every five seconds or so.Musically all the songs are there but I can't tell if they were done live or just dubbed to go with the film editing. This could have been a great live DVD unfortunately it simply wasn't due to the poor choice of format. If you want the music buy the CD and stay away from this overly polished production.
1,I just don't get it.,I could only stand to watch about 20 minutes of this dvd.I never even smirked... was just not funny - the only thing I could recommend this for is if your having trouble sleeping pop this in an it will help tire you out but that is about it.Grade: F all over.
3,SMILE PROVOKING BUT NOT LAUGH OUTLOUD FUNNY,"Yes, the title of this CD is THOU SHALT LAUGH. Well, I don't really need to be commanded to laugh, urged to laugh or even gently reminded to so because I truly love to laugh. Unfortunately, the line of comedians presented here didn't elicit many laugh-out-loud times from me but did bring forth smiles.Emmy Award winner, radio talk show host, and musician John Tesh is, of course, and amicable host. He conveys sincere warmth and enthusiasm.Now, rather than risk spoilers I'm not going to quote any of the comedians - suffice it to say that their humor is gentle and well meaning. As I indicated these are not words to bring forth chortles or guffaws but rather smiles of appreciation or understanding.My biggest smiles were for Taylor Mason who mixes ventriloquism and piano with his stand-up routine, and Michael Jr.'s take on ""creepy Christians.""- Gail Cooke"
2,Safe to Eat While Watching,"Yes, you can enjoy your food while watching this DVD because nothing is funny enough to induce you to choke on your food with laughter.Oh, there are some funny moments, but good humor should have more than one laugh every fifteen minutes.Rex Havens has a good routine about car names, but it mostly gets worse from there. Joe Wong seems like a novice with no experience in performing as he delivers a completely humor free routine. Dana Daniels is downright terrible. Michael Jr is ok and delivers one good line at the end of his routine. Isaac Witty... zzz zzz zzz oh, sorry, I fell asleep. The final comedian, Taylor Mason, is a talented ventriloquist and pianist. Overall this DVD is funny and it should put a smile on your face.There is no reason clean humor can't be hilarious. Bill Cosby delivered a ton of clean humor in the 1960s which was creative and ""roll on the floor"" ""laugh out loud"" funny. This DVD in contrast barely rates a chuckle."
4,Pretty funny overall,"One caution; one segment by Michael Jr. is definitely not family-friendly. The rest are safe for everyone. One of the comedians is a ventriloquist, another does some magic as part of his act. A good variety and lots of laughs. One routine about how men have two colors of shoes and women have dozens, which he recites quickly, is hilarious."
2,Not what was expected,"Having never heard of or seen any previous versions, I did not know what to expect but was intrigued by the thought of stand up comedy that did not use profanity and crudeness to get a cheap laugh. While this definitely fit the bill for most of those things, it came up really short on comedy. I now know why the title is what it is - you are being commanded to laugh even if it is not funny. I found it to be rather bland and boring, and not even worthy of a cheap rental."
3,Celan humor - pretty funny!,"This is a good CD with clean humor featuring six tier 2 comedians. I liked all but one of them, and some werw quite funny. Above the average omedy central quality but not by much. What I mean is that this is not Blue Collar Comedy. Still, quite entertaining."
2,albumpusher,"When I heard ""Feed me Weird Things,"" I was blown away. When I saw this album cover, I was sucked in. So I bought it. Unfortunately, it is obvious that Mr. J spent no time on this album. Unless he's incredibly slow at programming his 303. The beats are fine, I'll grant him that, but the annoying prevalence of the blunted, annoying, piercing sound of the 303 just drives me insane. The only parts I enjoy are the 30 second jazzy interludes. Jenkinson has also apparently lost his sense of melody completely. I recently heard that Mu-ziq's new idol is Squarepusher...then for the love of GOD PLEASE PICK UP YOUR ACT! DON'T SEND A GOOD MAN TO WASTE!"
1,Sourced used to make claims are questionable,"This book was not created by a professional scholar, but a ""professional researcher"" whatever that means. It stands on the ""Myth of the Burning Times"" when this is all it is, a MYTH. When you use this book as source material, you are giving yourself over to questionable, refutable evidence. This book should be listed under ""popular"" or ""New Age"" history, for it misleads the reader to believe that women have practiced paganism and witchcraft from time immemorial;it tells women that they were innocent victims and helpless bodies of torture and death throughout Western Civilization. Not only is this unheartening, it simply isn't true. Always question what you read and check the source material. Apparently, Ms. Walker has grossly failed to do so. This book is not a classic, it is classically wrong!"
5,Absolutely Essential Reading!,"I'm on my second copy of this book. I literally wore the first one out. This is an absolute must in any library. Naturally, it's of interest for Feminists and students of Women's Spirituality, but it is relevant to everyone in Western Culture. It gives a new perspective on the origins of many of our popular myths, customs, symbols and beliefs that would give any reader a more balanced perspective of these topics.Highly recommended for everyone; an absolute requirement for Feminists, Witches and other Pagans, as well as any student of Thealogy or Theology.Keep in mind that books on Women's Religion often go out of print for long periods of time - buy this while you can!"
2,Women Studies Student's Hopes are Dashed!,"I remember happily embracing this weighty tome in highschool, thinking that the secrets of the universe had finally been revealed to me. I was so excited at what seemed to be such an in-depth recovery of women's 'herstory' at last revealed! What a let down to find later on such eminent feminist (& Pagan) scholars as Margot Adler (Drawing Down the Moon) deriding Walker's sources and her interpretations of said sources.It would be marvelous if B. Walker honestly re-edited & re-released WEMS with more stringent scholarly research, even if the resulting book is just half its original size. This would restore much credibility to her work and be worth the effort. For myself, I'd be happy if such an encyclopedia was only a quarter of it's original size as long as it was ACCURATE."
4,Know your Herstory.,"Jack holland summed it up best when he mentioned that the romans had the morals of a bitch, a beast, a souless carnal creature and male property. Women of the time were classified with beast and invalids, at best worse.Walker did a fine job pointing out that they considered women lower than slaves, since slaves were or could be free people. Unfortuantey, she faied to point out all the slanderous female monsters and projections of males. She missed that an aspect of hecate was a virgin made not associated with the bitch, which is slander. yet, Barbara did a fine job finding truth about Medusa, and who first degraded Hag, by emphasize elder and loss of becauty and forgeting the wisdom of age.She also did a superb job of eluding to the true mythos or stereotypes of pagan and christian devils and gods: Pan, Baphomet, Christ, Mithra and Lucifer. All in all quite complete."
1,No excitment no ratings,This book was a terrible book. It was boring and tiring! The text had no feeling and had no grab. All it wasn't is the question. I've seen better from amateurs! Sorry but you read it you'll regret it!!!!!! PEACE DOG
5,Wonderful Christmas Compilation!,"This CD is a perfect mix of Christmas favorites! My four-year-old daughter loves it. We sing along to all of the songs together. Dominic the Donkey reminds me of my childhood with my Italian grandparents enjoying Christmas. It is such a cute song for the entire family! And Feliz Navidad is great to sing along to as well. To balance out the catchier tunes, there are classic, beautiful Christmas carols to enjoy the true meaning of Christmas. I highly recommend this CD for the entire family to help celebrate your Christmas season!"
3,Should adapt to wide screen,Shame that such a great film is not available in wide screen yet. Fitting the format for TV/small screen really takes away from the choreography.
2,I initially loved the cups but grew to dislike them,"When we initially purchased the cups, I was thrilled with their non-spill and non-leak feature. My son would throw them about without any leaks.After a couple of weeks of usage the plastic valve broke which allowed my son to place his thumb inside the valve and rip the plastic out completely. If I had not caught it, I'm sure it would be a chocking hazard.I use them for my 14-month old son's thick smoothies of fruit and yogurt and just keep a careful eye to detect when he's grown tired of it so I can grab it before he sends it flying."
2,Good for a while but don't last long,"We got these sippys when our twins got old enough to drink from a sippy we thought that they were cool, easy to clean, and easy for the kids to drink from. And then it happened the nipple part cracked and needed replaced, no big deal our walmart carried these thats were we got them, we got them for 99 cents a sippy. Bad news!!! They don't make replacement nipple peices. So once its ruined you have to through the thing out waste of money. I really thought I was going to like these and I did at first but after your kids's teeth come in it wont be long before you throw the sippy out, so if you stop to think about it, its cheaper in the long run to get sippy's that have replacement peices and ones that arent silocone. Wish I would have stuck with my gerber and playtex sippy cups, harder to clean but I don't have to replace them unless something really bad happens to them."
3,Pretty lousy audio quality,"I am giving this three stars because it is, after all, a Bruce performance and stellar in that respect, as always. But I'm extremely disappointed with the almost bootleg quality audio and only passable video resolution. Of course it didn't help that I viewed it immediately following the amazing NYC set (the most fantastically produced live music DVD I've ever seen). I can see why some might be mistaking this for a bootleg; it definitely feels like it in places.Since many reviewers seem to think the audio is fine, there can only be two explanations:1. Those reviewers have low standards for audio quality, or2. There are copies of varying quality out there."
5,Excellent concert DVD,"I've been to 3 Bruce concerts, and this DVD concert is better than any I went to. The power, and passion Bruce and the entire band exert is energizing, especially in the opening song ""The Rising"". The addition of Suzie Tyrell to the band is as Bruce sings on ""Crush On You"" c'est manifique! She delivers a sound, and a warm-friendly look which captured my attention. This concert DVD is a must see. I'm just praying it will be digitally mastered to CD, because I'll be the first to purchase it."
2,Sounds like an audience bootleg recording,"Disappointed to say the least, the mix sounds like a ""decent audience tape."" I can't believe it. It's disgusting. I compared the broadcast version against the ""real"" DVD and the broadcast sounds like a soundboard. The ""real"" DVD is a disgrace. My guess is that Landau and Co. wants the fan to feel like he's at the show. Well duh, I'm not at the show, I'm in my living room, where I have close-ups of his nostrils and overbite. I should have a soundboard to go with those close-ups.Ranting? Yes! It's a good thing it only cost me $12 bucks. On a positive note the video looks good."
1,Could the sound be worse?,The sound on this DVD is a total disappointment. Save your money - or buy his NY Concert.
5,Better live than on CD,"This is my first experience of seeing Bruce and co. and I found it exhilerating.He gives 300% and is totally present and expressive of what he is singing about.He begins on a really strong note with 'The Rising' and it doesnt let up from there on. I kept revisiting the haunting 'Empty Sky' done in duet, and 'Missing you' and found 'Ramrod' a fascinating piece with Bruce really abandoning himself to a wide range of struts and facial expressions.These songs are expanded from his original takes of them on CD and are a major advance over them.I found the whole thing completely satisfying and enjoyable and can definitely recommend this album to those who dont know Bruce or who only know him from CD. I'm sure all established fans too would be more than satisfied."
2,Manufacturing Defect on 2nd Disc,"The music is great of course and the 1st disc was good. I concur with many of the other reviews for the music.The manufacturing defect and customer service from SONY is complete crap. This is unaceptable. It's obvious they don't care one bit about customer service, otherwise they would do a better job."
2,an essential dvd for the cd,i am very disapointed with this release it was and probably is sony / columbia told him like billy joel lets make a big marketing thing and throw out what ever crap you want to bruce on dvd and he said what about this crap screw the fans
5,excellent! stake your claim now!,"Lovers of poetry, give your ear to Alfred Corn! Collected here is the cream of his poetry, and whether you favor the silkiness of Corn's language or the way he almost stalks his subject matter through the stanzas, you'll be impressed by the kernals of wisdom contained in each piece. If you get to hear Alfred (known as ""Pop"" to his friends) read his own poetry, you won't be disappointed. His husky voice lends an aura of authenticity to the work, and he's usually happy to field questions after the reading."
2,Not as great as I thought.,It was ok but not as interesting as I thought. A lot of the facts are already very well known by many. I was expecting more.
4,A good gift for the new Airman...,This was purchased as a gift for a new Airman. It covers a lot information on how to navigate the Air Force and has turned out to be helpful. I would suggest buying the newer one as this was originally purchased back in 2009.
4,air force,what a great way to see the world; this book has helped lauch the careers of many of today's airmen. fly high.
5,I love Jane Austin books.,"I love this type of movie because of it's lack of nudity, violence, and moral story. The English stories of old are some of my favorites."
2,Not compatible with Vista!!!,"The YP-MT6 is not and will not be compatible with Vista, no matter what the Samsung website suggests. Samsung Customer Service told me that I have to revert back to XP to get it to sync with my new computer (yeah right). Caveat Emptor for all Samsung Products.The unit itself is great, I have had it for a year, but it is useless if it cannot be used in the ""flash-drive"" fashion in which it was designed.I wouldn't buy a samsung again."
1,defective,"I gave this item 2 tries. The first unit would not power off. Sent it back for replacement. The second had the same problem, and also would not respond to attempts to change the play mode. Returned for refund. I still like Samsung mp3 players but this one didn't work for me."
2,smells good,"My son was pleased with his cologne. I felt the price was too high for the amount, especially when I saw other fragrances offered in much larger amounts for less money."
4,Excellent,"I got it for a very good price and it does works great, only a few time i have feel some noise and low volume when speaking, but that's probably the phone company."
1,Another disappointment,"I have searched for the best player for WMA files for almost a year now. I first bought the Zen Touch by Creative. It was great but it was a little big and I lost it. Then, I found the sleek samsung color player! Sounds great! Wow, was I wrong. I have over 2000 songs saved on my computer so I wanted a hard drive player again. Thats when I bought the beautiful samsung design only to find it couldn't hold all my music. The more songs I downloaded, the longer the player took to boot up every time I wanted to use it. To the point where it wouldn't turn on and wouldn't charge. Sorry Samsung but you didn't do it."
1,Horrible! Constant Static! Low volume! Don't buy this!,"This phone is horrible. Before this phone, I had a panasonic cordless for like 10 years. It worked great, but the buttons began to fail. I wanted a cheap one, so despite the bad reviews for this product, I thought, ""I will be different."" plus, it was very cheap. Well, it's cheap b/c it sucks. There is constant static when I'm using it, and changing the channels on it won't help at all. The speakerphone feature, which was the main reason I got this one, is awful. It is hard to hear the other person even when it's on the highest volume setting. You have to hold the phone up to your mouth, which defeats the purpose of speakerphone! I would return this phone, but returns are always a big hassle. And also, while I was getting a new phone, I wouldn't have use of a phone in my house. And also, it would cost like $10 to ship it back, and the phone is like $20, so it's pointless. In conclusion, don't buy this phone. It's a piece of junk."
2,Noisey reception. Confusing interface.,"So... if you're on speakerphone and you click speakerphone again to disable it... it hangs up. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb...On top of that - it makes constant background noise. Changing channel does not help.But... it's the phone I'm stuck with. Once you remember not to hang up on people and you're in the same room as the base, it works OK."
5,This work was well ahead of its time.,"I bought this book back in 1981, the first printing. Fortunately, I still have the copy, since this book has become a classic of the genre. This book was and is a motivator of the imagination. For readers of SF, it was wonderful to know that there were people out there who dared to visualize what we could only picture in our minds back in the days before sophisticated computer graphics made science fiction images so simple to create, and exotic aliens so commonplace. Two of my favorites were the Guild Steersman and the Puppeteer, being a Herbert and a Niven fan. Barlowe and Summers deserve places as two of the great pioneers of SF."
5,Amazing,"It could be science fictionmyths...unrealistic scenario,but certainly it is amazing.So much work went in thepreparation of this book.So much details.My God!It is really amazing....S. Mahdi, Cairo, Egypt."
5,Gives new meaning to loving a book to death,"_Wayne Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials_ is my 12 year old son/fantasy/scfi fanatic's favorite book. It is dog-eared from so much love, reading, studying and attention. This is no kid's book, though--these are the wunderkind's Wayne Barlowe's illustrations that have appeared in many famous scfi books. Each alien has a full bio-ethnographic description, bring each to life."
2,Looks cheap,I was disappointed when I got this. It looks much better in the picture than in actual. Looks like cheap plastic.
3,"Predictable, but with some new detail","The story of Elia and Anna follows predictably along, and even Elia's journey to find her through Ukraine and Poland had no hidden surprises. But, some of the descriptions of life in the death camps - of the Jewish workers and their survival of places like Treblinka - were very revealing. I have been to many of the places in the book, have read a lot about the holocaust, but some of the details presented in this book are new, or at least have been described in a new way to me. Buy it used."
5,How delightful!,Ricky Cohen's love of people and children is so evident and contagious. Reading this book allows a multitude of warm fuzzies to pour over your heart and mind. He proves to us that following the right path in life is important only when we choose to love those around us.
4,Different..,"Definatly not altered carbon.....but a good read..Fans of the first novel may be disappointed however, as this one has a completely different tack."
5,A Tour de Force Collection to Remember him by,"This is a fantastic collection for anyone who was ever touched by MJ and his broad array of musical, dance and directing talents as well as his philanthropic endeavors. While everything on this DVD is outstanding, one of his greatest and most important legacies might be the Earth Song video he has left us and our children on this DVD. Don't miss it for the world and donate! MJK (age 61)"
2,This is a LOUSY DVD !,"I bought it because of all the great reviews saying the quality and content is great. First, the quality BARELY makes it to average-- I'd say most average DVDs are better than this. Compared to the Eagles and Roy Orbison DVD which was mastered in DTS, and Britney Spears Live, this DVD bites the dust!In terms of content, the only piece that was worth putting into this DVD was Motown 25 where Jackson did Billy Jean and the MTV music awards (it was good but not THAT great as others have put it). The others are OLD video music clips that you used to see on MTV decades ago! The quality of the sound for those clips are laughable -- you would laugh too if you didn't pay money for the DVD. Side two is just more of music videos-- the dolby digital mix is SO bad, you'd barely hear any difference than if you listen to audio CDs."
5,Michael J. DVD,I enjoyed this DVD thoroughly! The performance at the MTV Awards is amazing. Definitely worth the money! RIP Michael Jackson.
2,No Subtitles on this DVD.,I am huge fan of Michael Jackson and ordered this set. The songs listed on this DVD are the best songs. But there are no Subtitles and the DVD quality is also not so good as I thought. This is like watching on basic TV channel but at least they have Closed Captions to see what the lyrics are. I wanted to return this DVD but I did not see any other DVD set of Michael Jackson that has subtitles.
1,Of limited usefulness,"This does not hold as much as I thought it would. Purchased to hold items in the cargo area of my Smart car (if you have a Smart you know how things tend to roll around the back and fall into the crevice between the cargo area and front seat) but the soft sides flop over and do not hold samll items well. Only two grocery bags actually fit in this. It might be more efficient if it was not divided into two sections, but then it probably would be ven more ""floppy"". The only way to keep the sides upright as in the picture is to fill it with items, as in the picture. This may be a good product for some uses but not for the Smart car."
1,Not a substitute for the original!,"This review refers *only* to the Ramble House / Fender Tucker edition, 2005/6.I bought this edition from the publisher (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) in May 2006. I compared it carefully with my copy of the original edition (1939). I was disappointed to find HUNDREDS OF ERRORS in the Ramble House edition -- including some real howlers like ""Smiting"" (page 164) for ""Smiling"" (in the original, page 252).On the whole it appears that this edition (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) was printed from a defective e-text made from a fuzzy photocopy of the original edition. And since there are already a number of defective e-texts on line, it's hard to see why we need one in print."
2,Really not quite worth it.,"Immediately after opening the package, I noticed the cover was incredibly pixelated and did not fit entirely on the cover. In large sections of the book, some characters, especially apostrophes, display as squares ('), representing a missing character. The quality of this product is very low, and it is apparent that little care went into its creation. The story itself is mediocre, but decent for not using the letter 'e'. The best part of the book is looking at some of the clever ways the author avoided using the letter 'e', but don't expect a good story. I intend to return this item if possible."
4,good coverage but Cingular style antics,"Cingular offers the best coverage in San Diego and probably southern California. We only used 350 of the 550 because most of our friends also have cingular (free m2m). After reviewing our bill we had over 3000 minutes combined or about 2cents a minute. The only cons i see are that 1) Cingular will be raising the sms from 10 to 15 cent. Total ripoff! 50% increase wow! 2) the first month you need to pay in advance. I at first did not understand, but I took a long look at the bill and talked to CS to clear everything up (when our service is over I will only be paying taxes and any additional chargess)."
5,Project pig and friends,Finally received this dvd I really love these old cartoons I gave it five stars because it has brought my grandchildren much joy
5,Walt Disney Classic Nature,"I remembered this video from my childhood, so I ordered it for my grandkids. They absolutely loved it and so did I along with my 86 year old Dad. I couldn't find it on dvd - which it should be. This film really piqued my interest in nature and was such a joy to see my grandchildren and my aged father enjoy it so much. It brought back memories of sitting in front of the television with my family on Sunday night to watch Disney and remember it as being a very warm and close time with them. I was 9 years old at the time and it has impacted me to this day!"
4,The series that keeps on giving,"RUNNING HOT is a gift from the Arcane series that keeps on giving. As the series develops the interconnections across time and space, the book taps on this energy. Its almost time for a family tree."
4,Best villian ever,is the 'Killer Diva'. I just loved her. I don't know how she came up with her but I thought she was fabulous. I liked the main characters also - I thought they were pitched just right. Enough character / 'tough life' stories to make them interesting but not so over the top they were unbelievable. Of course you have to buy into the whole Arcane Society thing but if you can it all works. I would like to see at least one main character who is not an off the chart talent though. One thing I appreciated about Running Hot was the minimal fill-in stuff about the Arcane Society. I've read all the other ones and was glad to see I didn't have to wade through a lot of repetitive explanations.
1,Enough with the paranormal already,What's with JAK's obsession with the paranormal and ESP. Every book she's written in the past 5 years have been about this. Very boring. And her characters are only clones of characters in her other books. No originality. I've noticed lately that several old time writers have gone down hill in their writing. Stuart Woods for example. His last several books were lousy. Very sad. I used to think JAK was a great writer. Now she's mediocre at best.
3,"OK, but there are better openers out there",It's okay.. lots of parts .. which get lost... I prefer other wine openers to this one.
1,Insta Pull - Insta Broke!,Purchased the Insta Pull wine gift set for my wife. Went to open the first bottle of wine and literally before even adding pressure the handle fell off! Obviously not real impressed with this product.
3,Enjoyable light reading.,Good book for introducing a middle/high school student to in following up on general world history class. Easy to read and understand.
1,Windows often doesn't see it,"I've used this enclosure with a Seagate 160GB 2.5 inch drive, and have been very frustrated. Even with external power (from an AC adapter) or power from a second USB port, Windows often doesn't ""see"" the drive, or sees it for a while, then the drive disappears as you're trying to use it. This happens on a ThinkPad running Vista, a ThinkPad running XP, and an HP desktop running Vista, so I don't think the USB ports or the computer is the problem. Very frustrating. The case is attractive and well built, but the inability of Windows to see the drive makes me crazy."
5,Very nice case.,"This case came well packaged. Looks to be produced in Japan in original packaging. The case itself seems well constructed and well insulated with the the memory foam. I have dropped this case with my old cheap laptop from 2 feet and it has withstood which is a plus. However, IMO I wouldn't experiment dropping it at all with a computer in it as its purpose to me is just a case to protect from scratches and abrasions from daily activities not for dropping. The white case coloration seems to attract stains, but can be easily removed with a little soap and water. Overall, I rate this case a 5 b/c it is well made and serves its purpose well."
5,Keeps getting better,"I live in the Southwest and have been impressed with Laurent Martres' dedication to touring around and writing about this area. I started reading his recommendations for hiking and photography when a friend gave me his ""Land of the Canyons"" book in the late 1990s. While this first book covered mostly the well-known areas of the Southwest, this latest iteration provides information on places that I'd only seen pictures of but didn't know where to find. Additionally there are places in here that I hadn't heard of after living here over 20 years but that are now on my ""to do"" list. If you're planning on visiting the Colorado Plateau, this book will keep you busy in Utah for several weeks. The color photographs make this book very appealing and the wealth of information on seldom-seen places will have you planning new trips to the region with your camera and camping gear."
5,A great guide,"This is a wonderful guide for photographers or anyone looking for scenic areas to visit. You will need a good map to use with the book however, and it can be a little difficult to follow at times. I have purchased his other guides also."
1,The book should not be recommended for University programs,"I am very disappointed, could not force myself to finish it! This book should not be recommended for University programs. It is biased, full of stereotyping, and has ""popular"", rather than scientific references (with all my respect to Daniel Goldman's Emotional Intelligence commercial success). Textbooks should be professional and free of political agendas."
1,Totally biased,"If I could have rated this book zero or less, I would have done so. This book is required for a grad school course I am now taking. I am struggling to read each chapter because of the biased perspective of the authors. This book SHOULD NOT be required reading for any course!"
2,Short life,After a few weeks the phones started dieing one after the other. New batteries did not help. Display became unreadable and then stopped. Took last two phones and gave to the Goodwill Store.
1,POC,"Piece of crap. The batteries of all 3 phones die after about 15 minutes. And when they're not dying from crappy batteries, they also lose connection and display ""searching....."". Do yourselves a favor, buy something else"
2,Not Block's best,"This very early Block story is effortlessly entertaining,but extremely featherweight compared to most of Mr.Blocks books. Its funny and fast moving,adequate for a quick summer beach read,but pales in comparison to almost any other Lawrence Block book."
3,A bear going places ...,"Yay! Another author for me to go bananas over! I am definately going to be looking at more Kotzwinkle books.Riddle me this: What does a bear do when he finds a manuscript in a briefcase under a log?Answer: He christians himself Hal Jam and gets what every bear needs: an agent and a publicist.The process from bear to best-selling author is hugely entertaining, with small flashes of insight into modern day living, and the way people communicate."
5,I Can Identify!,"As a ""sometimes"" writer (and some say a bear!) I can really identify with this book. I loved it! William Kotzwinkle is a sheer genius. Anyone who can read this and not be reeling with laughter is, in my opinion, a bear with no sense of humor!"
2,Just OK,"The Bear Went Over the Mountain could easily been condensed into 100 pages. I was not impressed, though I will admit that it had some ""laugh out loud moments."" But I would not recommend it to anyone, there are so many other well written books to chose...why waste your time."
5,Perhaps the funniest book I have ever read.,The summary above--and the numerical rating I've given--says it all
1,"poor video quality, low quality product","I ordered this product from Tigerdirect. The quality of the video was poor. I contacted Tigerdirect, but their returns policy was so much effort that I just threw the switch in the trash rather than deal with the aggravation of returning it to Tigerdirect."
5,Outstanding!,I had this thing up and running as advertised in less than 5 minutes. This kvm is by far the best deal out there; other products either require power and/or additional kvm cables.... This product will allow you to keep your old computer as a workhorse rather than turning it out to pasture (or the glue factory!).
3,"Nifty and cheap, but expect flickering","I just installed my IOGear MiniView Micro KVM, but I noticed that one of my PCs has some annoying flickering. I've tried different refresh rates, but the flicker is still there. It's an annoying, horizontal flicker, noticable along the edges of my windows. At the lowest resolutions (640x480, 800x600), the flicker goes away, but that's not acceptable for me, as I need to work in at least 1280x1024. But the strange thing is that my other machine, which is also set at the same resolution and frequency, does not have this problem! I believe the flickering could be some incompatibility between the cheap, on-board video that my Dell Optiplex has and the Micro KVM switch. The other machine that has no flicker has its own ATI video card.Another problem I noticed is that the scroll lock occasionally stops working, and unfortunately, there is no way to switch between the PCs manually."
1,It cost me a PC,"After I used this KVM, I started to have problems with my two Dell PCs (XP professional on 8300 and SC400) - My PCs kept shutting off themselves. The error message said that I had a bad video card driver or a bad hardware driver. I did not know it was the KVM issue so I formated/uninstalled/reistalled windows professional/2003 servers on both PCs for at least 5 times. My Dell 8300 finally died on me with a message like bus drive not recognized and I could not even see any hard drives when I tried to install the windows xp. Finally, I unplugged the KVM and my survived pc (SC400) works fine and it has never shut off itself.I am not sure if it was the usb mouse or high resolution on my monitors causing my PCs malfunction. Yet, I am surprised that this little KVM device could kill my fully loaded Dell 8300 just like that."
2,Unreliable!,"I've bought two of these, and both have gone bad. The first one quit working almost immediately, and the the second one quit four months ago. We have the same brand of KVM switches (the four port model) at the community college where I'm an IT student, and we have had quite a bit of trouble with them. I would not bother buying another one from this brand."
2,Doesn't play well with a Model M keyboard or high-res monitor,"Like many reviewers I wanted to use this switch to connect between a PS/2 PC and a USB-only laptop, with a PS/2-USB Y-adapter between the KVM and the laptop. It worked fine for connecting the keyboard and mouse to the PC, but KVM messed up the display timings for the monitor (1920x1200 resolution), resulting in a flickering, distorted image. Connecting to the laptop resulted in the same image problems, as well as the keyboard not working at all. I know these old IBM Model M keyboards draw more current than newer PS/2 keyboards, but apparently this KVM wasn't able to handle that. I sent mine back."
1,Can't type too quickly or it will bonk out,"What a piece of junk. I am tired of having to restart my machine because this thing bonked out because I typed too quickly. Apparently it cannot process too many keystrokes.When I type quickly, the Iogear Mini KVM switch apparently gets confused and freezes up and starts ""switching"" the monitor off, then on, then off, then on in 1 second intervals. The keyboard is no longer responsive.The only way to fix it is to turn it off by unhooking everything that can provide electricity to the unit (all cords to both PCs).However, sometimes that doesn't fix it, and I have to restart my machine, which means I lose ALL unsaved work.My advice is that, if you work from home, AVOID this at all costs. If you are in the middle of doing anything important and you type one-too-many-keys at the wrong moment, your work is toast."
5,Great office system,"I bought these to replace a clunky shelf-top stereo in my office, both to save space and improve the sound. I am very happy on both fronts -- the main speakers take up very little space on my desk, and the subwoofer hides on the floor. Playing Internet radio or MP3's from my laptop, they sound much better than a desktop stereo system would, even one in the $300 or $400 price range, in my opinion. They also sound better than a 5.1 $250 speaker system I have with my home computer.So, this ends up being a very inexpensive way to get reasonable quality sound in a small space. As another reviewer has noted the touch-sensitive volume control is a classy touch, and works as it should. I am strongly considering getting a second set to connect w/an iPod for a bedside music system."
3,Good Speakers,"I got my speakers about a month ago. Mainly I go them for the iPod. They have amazing sound quality. For speakers so small the sound is amazingly crisp and clear. The bass is good, but a little unclear when turned up to maximum power. (It takes some adjusting on the subwoofer to get the bass right.) The little lights under the speakers provide for a nice little effect. Overall I think they were a good buy. I would have given them 4 stars except for the problem that I had with them when first bought. They worked for about 2 days and then one day the speakers decided to play full-blast all the time, and I couldn't turn them down. Luckily the product was still in warranty, and I was able to get new ones. So far these new ones have been great and have no problems."
2,Just OK...,"I did not buy this product brand new but am fortunate not to have done so. It does have decent sound but lacks any punch if used with an iPod. I expected better than this. My $20 ""Evermax"" 2.1 speaker system purchased at a computer show sounds better than this."
4,Looks Great,This item looks really great on my Chevy Silverado. I must tell you though that you must have some patience while installing this.
5,A must read,"An immensely enjoyable book, both funny and thought provoking. Tibor Fischer deserves far more publicity than he gets."
4,I good scare for the soul,I saw this movie in the 1993 and it scared the heck out of me. I was a bit spooked for a while because I just felt the legend. Being a black man I just felt like it was more beliveable than most other horror films.
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Candyman is perhaps the best horror movie ever made, it is brilliant, at first i was not that bothered about it, but when i watched it the second time, it really opened my eyes!!!!This film will nit let you down, buy it for your own good!!!!"
2,hmmm...,"This movie is filled with ""Could-Have-Been."" Not enough follow through. besides the fact that it is a rediculously bad rendering of the Classic Clive Barker story, it really has no solidity as a film of the genre of horror. I was more appalled than scared. It lacks all of the punch that Hellraiser has, and all of the thought that went into Lord of Illusions. It's a mess. Avoid it if you have any devotion to Clive Barker. The reason it gets 2- Tony Todd is interesting, not accurate, but interesting. I'd never looked at the Candyman with any nature of humanity, but his performance demands it. I prefer the Candyman that I pictured, regardless."
2,"Strangely fun , but essentially poor","Typical of Clive Barker's notion of blood/gore ,sudden shocks appeal he drew on in his previous feature Hellraiser,Candyman features horrormeister Tony Todd as the titular bogeyman who appears out the mirror whenever you say his name five times.There are a few impressive sudden jerk moments (which were actually worked to better effect in the sequel),there is an effective cold,eerie tone to each of the scenes in the film and it certainly had quite a cult following when it was released back in 1992.But it does suffer from a fair number of flaws,not least the simple premise of the film itself:put it this way,to spite the 18 certificate ,if any minors see the film and have nightmares about it,all you have to do is stand in front of a mirror and do what the film suggests to prove to them it's not real."
2,Mediocre,This is one of the most average horror movies I've ever seen. The 1990s was a miserable time for the horror genre. The fact that some consider Candyman to be an underrated classic highlights my point. I do like the idea of a researcher looking into an urban legend but the movie is just not well done. The characters are awful and the movie is simple not scary in any way.
4,Better than expected!,This movie turned out to be more involving and structured than I expected. It tends to drag in the middle but it's complexity increases as the plot moves along. Overall: PRETTY GOOD!
3,One of the most original horror movies of the decade,"Every average and hardcore horror fan should have this in their movie collection. Not as scary as most people say, but lots of gore and entertainment with a very original story."
2,Definitely Not Worth It,"This film is not worth buying unless you absolutely must own every horror flick out there. Otherwise just rent it once, and no more than once, the plot is confusing and the acting is pathetic. I personally would just skip it, since I rented it for 20 cents and was left feeling that I was ripped off."
1,Scary.... are you kidding? Rated G,"""Candyman"" will definitely give you a ""tootache"",""cavitity"" and a ""trip to the doctor"".I believe it's the slowest, dumbest,lousy creation Wes has even done. I am really into scaryand this ranks the ""lowest"" for me. What a disappointment.Nothing scary about it. No edge of your set,no jumps, bumps nothing. It really isn't worthwatching. A real disappointment.(Needed tosay it twice)."
2,"Good device, bad forecast","The device is simple to set up, and generally works great. However, it is always showing rain in the forecast even when its absolutely sunny outside and there."
3,A messy affair.,"This freeform documentary sounded promising, but in the end fell far short of expectations. Which were not high to begin with. There must not have been much in the way of competition for feature length documentaries if it was nominated for an Oscar. The filmmakers need to clean up the mess because it's all over the place. There is no clear statement(s) being made and no real direction being taken. Watching the extras on the DVD, there is a second semi-feature broken up into sections that hints at something larger, but goes just as far as the documentary does; nowhere."
3,It was Okay!,"First of all, I just felt that the video was super long. I didn't really enjoy as much as I thought I would. Can't really say what made me become disinterested."
4,great dvd,This is a great yoga dvd for people that are just starting out. Also for anyone who just needs to stretch more.
5,So You Want to Be a Dog Trainer,"Nicole has done a wonderful job. This book really is a useful, practical presentation for anyone interested in pursuing a career in dog training. Insightful, witty and matter-of-fact, I recommend this book without reservation. A job extremely well done and obviously done with skill and compassion."
5,The BEST book I've read on becoming a dog trainer,"When I decided to become a dog trainer, I had so many questions. Do I need to be certified? What type of school should I go too? Where can I connect with other trainers? What books should I read? What methods should I avoid? How should I market myself? And most importantly - WHERE DO I START?!This book was helpful in answering all of these questions plus more. It also gave advice and suggestions for things I hadn't even thought of yet. It also has a lengthy resource section which has been extremely helpful for me and other newbie trainers.If you're looking to get into the business, this is an excellent place to get your start. The information contained here are invaluable and will get you on your feet - just like it did for me! I highly recommend it to anyone who's considering a career as a dog trainer."
4,Good reading,I bought this product and found it very easy to read with good tips and basic but essencial information on dog trainer business. It is very good for someone who is thinking about becoming a dog trainer.
1,Save your money!,Unfortunately there is no lower rating than 1 star. Save your money or go buy something from Dr Sears. Ezzo has no clue!!
1,This is SICK!!!,"RUN, run, run as far away from this book as you can. Take anything written by the Ezzo's and have a fire in the backyard.Although, if you are planning to be abusive parent, then go a head and do what his books say."
1,Thanks for the advice!,"Hi, as an expectant first time mother trying to get ready and get informed for the care of my little one, I am very glad I looked at your reviews and the Ezzo website! This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was all set to buy and follow it so I really thank you for the alert.Susie"
4,Good for practicing,"I purchased these to for practicing, so you can put this review in context. These balls are fine. Good weight, and durable."
5,"Crop Circles:Signs, Wonders and Mysteries","I am very pleased with this book. Steve Alexander's aerial photographs of the spectacular formations are sharp and Karen Alexander's text about their complex geometry is easy to understand. Anyone who has a genuine interest in this phenomenon will appreciate that this book neither rhapsodizes about the creators of the designs, nor rants about the foolishness of those who study them. It simply offers 280 images of these beautiful and intricate designs and illustrates the knowledge of geometry necessary to create them."
2,this is only one of hundred ferrari books,i didn't buy this book to my man because i have read many many other very good ferrari books in the world...and i think that parts of the content is already written in other very good books...the pictures are really okay.
2,Just ok.,"This book is just alright, nothing special. I'd look elsewhere - this is basically just another crabby gardener - no true blooming revelations."
1,Very disappointed,"I returned this product. We have older wiring in our home, and there are surges all summer long due to the A/C. We try to replace all surge protectors once a year to try to protect our electrial items. This product had excellent reviews, so I purchased it. Did not work! There was only one place where I was able to plug in a 3 prong connection.I don't have a lot of strength in my hands right now, but I was still able to plug in devices in other new surge protectors. Looking at the strip, there is some type of metal running through the 3rd prong area that prevents any cord from going in. Bought 2 of the 6 outlet surge protectors, and had the exact same problem. Also returned those."
1,CASUAL by Paul Sebastian FINE PARFUM SPRAY 4 OZ for Women,I'm disappointed with this product. No where on the bottle did the name of Paul Sebastian show up and I have bought the real thing before and his name is there on the bottle. I broke out into a rash where I put this perfume. Very unhappy
1,"Nonsense, complete and utter nonsense","A former car crash investigator for a small town police department reviews a few documents smuggled out of the official investigation and listens to far too many ""what ifs"" from an aide to New York congressman Michael Forbes. This leads James Sanders to conclude he's discovered what all the experts have missed. Please!Missile theorists like Sanders are engaged in a cover-up of their own. By casting doubt on the very real problem that this crash brought to light, they work against those who would make flying safer. Its a crime."
5,The Truth is in here!! A must read!!,"The saddening sickening truth is here, that a missilebrought down TWA 800 on July 18th 1996, is uncovered in this book. MrSanders had himself obtained proof from the crash debris showing that indeed a missile brought down the plane! He details how it happened as well us interviews with very credible eyewitness', and an unidentified informant within the NTSB official investigation team, who all KNOW that a U.S. Navy training missle brought the plane down, and how the U.S. government is trying to cover it tracks!"
2,disappointing,"The title is misleading. It lists acts of common courtesy, not random acts of kindness. There are better books on the subject."
1,Dissappointed,Had to put this disc outside for three months just to mute the smell - smelled like bubble gum rubber - yuchhh! The smell permeated the house.
5,the best rad,delphi is the most powerful rad to develop WINDOWS apps which can be ported to kylix !!
3,"Tremendous technicality, limiting variety","3 1/2Though even this huge compilation of the massive Pablo recordings retains an old-timey sameness throughout, there is simply no denying Tatum's touch, turning what could have been another dusty jazz relic into a solo piano enthusiast's analytical workshop."
4,I responded quite well actually,"When I first listened to this album I thought, ""Oh god, another waste."" It just didn't strike me as anything special and it sat on my bookshelf for some time ... at least until I sat down and really listened to the first CD. The last half puts me in a mood that's sort of like stepping into a smoky nightclub on Mars where a star wars contingent holds court in front of the DJ booth. Most other double-disc CDs just remind of that party where the DJ sucked and we paid way too much money to get in. Ashley Casselle takes me to the strangest places and I don't know if I should dance or just sit there staring at the speaker. It's that good. And I'm not into psychedelia. My only complaint is Disc 2, which, when I realized what the set actually was, didn't bother me as much. But still it doesn't have even half the drive of Disc 1. Then again I have yet to find a double-disc set that actually gets both of them right."
5,wow!,"this cd is the finest up to date. the mixing is seamless, the tracks are absolutely wicked with yummy phat bass lines. there are no words to describe what this cd makes me feel!"
3,One- Eyed Cat,"The book One-eyed Cat by Paula Fox is is about a boy named Ned. He gets a gun for his 11th birthday. Ned's dad says that Ned is not old enough to have a gun. He hides the gun in the attic. One night Ned decides that he just has to shoot the gun. He goes up to the attic and sneaks the gun out side. All of the sudden, he sees a shadow, he presses the trigger and fires the gun. After a long time he is helping an old neighbor and he sees a cat with only one eye. Ned is sure that he shot the cat and that is why it only has one eye. Will Ned ever tell anybody so that the guilt won't be so bad? Read the book One-Eyed Cat to find out. This was an okay book."
3,I thought this book was OK.,"I thought this book was OK, but really, I can say I haveread better. To begin with, this is one of those booksthat move slowly for most of the book, but near the endbegin to speed up. But, unfortunately for me, I did not quiteunderstand the end, and that left me thinking, ""So, what happensnext?"" Aside from that, the characters were well drawn, andthe scenery was perfect for the story.""The story requires some after-thought.""-Katie Manning/American School In Japan"
1,This was an awful book,This book had no interesting themes at all. I found the book very boring and i was dissapointed with reading it. I think this book is very over rated
2,"Bart's Review of ""One Eyed Cat""","Ned Wallis is a 11 year old boy that lives in New York city. One night he secretly takes a rifle that he is not allowed to touch and goes outside to shot it one time. He sees a dark shawdow and shots at it. On his way home he sees a face looking down at him from his attic window. One day, while helping a neighbor he sees a wild cat with one eye missing. He thinks back to when he took that one shot at that dark shawdow and wonders if it was him who shot that cat? The book didn't have much action and the characters were not that interesting."
4,N Scale Model Railroad That Grows,Excellent for beginners. Instructions permit the average person to create their own idea of a railroad. The instructions can be modified to create any layout.
4,every Austen fan should have one!,"Miss Jane Austen arrived at my home recently wearing a frock with a pink skirt, a crisp lacy bodice, and calico sleeves trimmed in lace. She also has elbow length gloves, which are not removable. The dress and her discreet bloomers are removable, so the doll and garments may be washed separately as necessary. Her silky brown hair is uncharacteristically short, but perhaps she had it cut due to illness. This is an adorable little rag doll and my second Little Thinker purchased from amazon. My seven year old daughter immediately attempted to set Jane up on a date with Will Shakespeare, but I had to explain that Jane is about two hundred years younger, so the match might not be perfect. I didn't even want to get into the Bard's marital situation! Overall, I am quite pleased with Miss Jane, and looking forward to buying my next Little Thinker- perhaps Queen Elizabeth, Socrates, or Gandhi."
4,#scifi @bantamspectra A fondly remembered favorite,"This was the very first book I ever reviewed on the Internet -- it was given to me by Ellen Key Harris of Del Rey books, who was a huge Internet pioneer for Random House. Mary Rosenblum has gone on to a successful career -- she's gifted both with a solid science background and with the ability to create empathetic, tough-minded, appealing characters. Well worth buying if you're a Rosenblum fan!"
2,Superficial book,"This book is relatively thin, but having 144 pages is for some good author enough to write a good book out of such a specialized subject. But that is in no way the case here. Actual size of variations in the book is 98 pages, with the other chapter of 46 pages of ""ilustrative"" games, which by the way really seems disconected from the first part of the book.In the Alekhine-Chatard attack, topical 6...Lg5 variation gets only about 20% of pages, and is explaned pourly, not going into any meaningful depth, for it to be useful of the player above 2000-2100 at all.Not recomended."
4,This book is as addictive as 'The Harvest' was...,"I was turned on to Robert Charles Wilson by a friend of mine. I was skeptical about reading sci-fi, since lately I've been into Hunter S. Thompson and Mario Puzo. I must say though I was blown away. Those of you who have been fortunate enough to read The Harvest will know exactly what I mean. Even though A Bridge of Years isn't quite as gripping, you still find yourself asking questions like 'what if I had the choice' and 'what if I were given that opportunity.' I thought The Harvest started out a bit slow, but this book jumps right into the action. The way Wilson writes makes his books very believable, they're not far-fetched at all. Great reading for most age ranges. The bad news is that these titles are now out of print, I actually came to this site looking for them. If you're ready to take an insight into yourself, and if you can find them, I highly recommend Wilson no matter what genre you prefer to read."
2,Faulty product NOT supported by Samsung,"I bought this player December '06, and was very pleased with it for 4 months. However, when I went to delete files one day, I got a No space for DB error, and the player froze on the Samsung screen. I reset the player to no avail. The player is not recognized by a computer now.I contacted Samsung in hope of help-my player is still under warranty.However, my serial number has rubbed off, because it's only a sticker stuck on the back, and wore off due to normal use. When I told Samsung the serial number was no longer readable, they wouldn't help, even though I still have my receipt to prove purchase. I researched to see if there was any fix I could do-this one error is very common to the player. Basically, Samsung won't support their product from a common problem that's endemic to their player. I can't recommend this product for this reason."
5,You get what you pay for,"Looks: Silver for 1 Gb version, Light blue for 512 Gb version, I have the silver one, has rounded corners and looks decent but not particularly impressiveFeatures: Plays many digital music formats, radio tuner, voice/line-in/radio recording function, with a touch of image view and text view, all inside the little box half the size of a mini-ipod.Cons: If you selected the play-mode as ""shuffle folder"" and then you switch to playing a different folder, then the player doesn't ""remember"" the previous play-mode setting and would default to playing the songs in the folder sequentially. Also there's limited playlist support, to create a playlist one has to select each song he wants in the playlist and press a button, if you want to add hundreds of songs in different folders into a playlist it'll take forever. Controls are intuitive enough but sometimes I find myself mistakenly pressed and held the 5-directional button when I wanted to simply press it and vice versa."
1,It is an AWFUL book.,"While I understand that the gender roles for women were very different and unchangeable, I thought this was just the most stereotypical group of characters there could possibly be. The main character's four brothers are pure unenlightened idiots who are all about ""protecting the weaker sex"". The heroine herself doesn't handle this at all! She's reduced to this character who is all talk but no action. The author keeps describing her as independent and self-sufficient, but how is that demonstrated in regards to her brothers? It's not; and that's pitiful. The aunt of the Earl of Stonebridge is the typical snotty, manipulative woman that utterly disgusts me.Ugh, I couldn't even finish the book! I just cannot stand such typical, assinine characters."
2,Not Quite the Thing,"This wasn't a terrible book but it was so full of trope that I almost had to force myself into reading it. Lady spies saving their male counter-parts, Capulet and Montague esque family bickering, and page after page of Big Misunderstandings. The secondary romance was tantalizing but should not have been there. I found myself caring more about the Duke and Jane than I did about the main H/h. But since they were not the primary most of their action happened off-stage and was spoken about later which I found frustrating. The book had potential but every plot device was glossed over rather than explained. It was a most frustrating read."
3,"Helpful, but too repetitious.","The ideas discussed were helpful, but the same ""buzz"" words were used too often throughout the book. Rather than expound on an idea, the same words were used over and over to describe what he was trying to say. The chapters then became longer, but no new information was provided. I kept looking for more explantion of an idea, but just kept getting the same terminology. ie. to define a word, the word was given as the definition. More examples should have been used. While I understood what Gray was saying about a women sitting back and letting a man do for her, I disagree with the door locking analogy. That's fine for the first date, but if you are becoming friends, I unlock a door from the inside out of common courtesy."
4,Solves the Modern Liberation vs Romance Paradox,"Gray's book is quite helpful for all of the woman who were raised in the past twenty years. While asking guys out on the first date is liberating, eventually many of those relationship falter. The plain truth is that if you are looking for a romantic relationship, then, as a woman, you need to let the guy take the lead in the first stages of dating or else you won't be happy. Gray has helped me realize this fact in his funny, straight forward work."
2,Men: don't bother,"Another installment in the continuing saga of Kiss Her Butt Enough and You Might Get Lucky. It would be nice if these authors who write ""you're right--he's wrong"" books for women would not represent them as being beneficial for both sexes. A better title for this one might be ""Women Should Always Get Their Way"""
3,Wrong Premise,"It seems like this book starts out with the wrong premise -- that dating is something you do in order to lead to getting a girl to sleep with you. While dating might be a noble way to lead to marriage, the whole idea is that you date to mate is ludicrious. I guess that explains why Dr. Gray has been married so many times.I think dating is more for having fun and getting to know one another -- becoming great friends. Two books I recently read that do a good job at giving excellent advice on dating are THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE and CREATIVE DATING."
5,CHANGED THE WAY I LOOKED AT MEN,I THINK THIS BOOK REALLY OPENS THE COMMUNICATION LINES....IT HELPS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR PARTNER IS THINKING....I READ IT ONCE INDEPENDENTLY AND NOW MY BOYFRIEND AND I ARE READING IT TOGETHER TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP
2,too long and boreing,"good examples of differences between men and women, but book could have been written on half the paper used to make the book! It seemed like it took forever to read this boreing book."
5,if you haven't read it you need to read this informative and openly honest book about relationships.,This book was an easy read. It outlined the differences between men and women and then explained how we can adjust to work together in order to interact with each other better. Loved it and so did all my friends.
4,A very good one but not 10 !,"A good collection of songs, Good stage performance. Great vocal performance of Philip Bailey although I would have expected to hear more of his personal collection. The phone conversations between songs (for the requests) are annoying. The sound is good and clear (Dolby Digital 5.1) but I would have expected to have it on DTS format also as other ""Live By request"" DVD's I own. The live dancers add a colorful background and make it a good live entertaining show which looks like was prepared pedantry and worth watching again and again. Includes all of EWF greates hits.Enjoy."
5,Fabulous Vegetarian Book: Save The Planet/Animals/Health,"If you care about either your Health, the Planet or the lives of living conscious beings that share the same senses we have then please read the great book by Pamela Rice, ""101 Reasons Why I'm A Vegetarian."" It is a fabulous read and if you are a caring person will no doubt change your life."
5,"Great Singer, Great Person","Was blessed to see Lynda on the Gaither Homecoming Cruise. Her spirit shines when she sings. What a great voice, what a great spirit."
3,A good book for people skills,"This is a good book for dealing with people, but not for training dogs. I would only recommend it in conjunction with other dog training books. A good read for people just starting out a dog training business. For anyone with experience, not real helpful although it had some useful reminders and tips."
5,Great for trainers,"This is an awesome book! If you have watched the Dog Whisperer at all, this book parallels Cesar's style and helps with the interview and talking to people one on one when figuring out what is really going on with the dog and human. If you truly want to help people and their dogs this a good book to get your confidence up and in their door."
5,"If you like ""The Lord of the Rings"" you'll love this book!","I realize, now that I'm all grown up, that fairy tales have lost the luster they once had. The myth and glamour they kindle in us seems to just fade away into a dark closet or...wardrobe. Thankfully, Mr.Lewis proves that age and youth are so closely interwoven that you just don't stop reading children's books, you begin to live them. He builds an ethical universe where acts of death, betrayal,love,heroism,and redemption, all made simple choices in a child's world to blur into the hard choices of the adult world. This book should be read by those children of 6 or 62. Read it out loud, at night, when you have the blues, or when things are going great! And maybe, just maybe, you'll meet that white stag in the snow under the lamplight leading you back home... P.Mille"
5,Confined Love,"'It was not an ordinary job...But then, Jane's employer, Paul Rouget, had seemed no ordinary man. Jane had only one thing to do-take care of Paul's small nephew (Martin) while enjoying a restful sea voyage.She never dreamed she could be part of a plot-until David Hallam, a man too disturbing for her own peace of mind, joined the cruise.Were his warnings about Paul to be heeded? Or was the real danger from David himself?"
4,It tames my crazy labs!!,"I have two labs and they loved to roam to roam the neighborhood before we got the fence system. I love it - the neighbors think the dogs are well-behaved when it is really the fence system. The ""train"" portion of the product isn't very easy to use (it drains the battery daily and you have to take the collar off the dog to turn the trainer on and off). But for containment in the yard - it is awesome!!! Very rarely do the dogs get the shock of correction, normally the warning tone is all they need to remind them of their boundaries."
4,The Collar,"I like the fencing system, but the collars need some work. The collar is very flimsy and will not stay on the notch it is set on. We have had to use duct tape to secure the collar so we could use the clasp. It is a design flaw."
2,Destiny Unleashed,"Misunderstandings and obligations once separated Destiny and William. As they meet again, the circumstances are still less than ideal. Broken hearts and business don't mix well; risking love could hurt the family business as well as their love, or so Destiny's business obsessed nephew believes. Nonetheless, love delayed is not be to love denied as they take a second chance on it.** Despite the nice aspect of having a hero and heroine who are extremely young and the hopeful air that the message that it's not too late conveys, there was something less than engaging to the tale, making it hard to hold focus on it. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
4,Where was I when........?,"Queens Logic is another of those movies where you ask yourself.... How did I miss this movie before? Queens Logic? Never heard of it!The movie is special for its little moments and its great characters. The bartender we all wish we knew (Marinaro), the sleazeball with a heart of gold (Tom Waits), Joey Clams, Joe Mantegna paying his employees ""in cash or check?"", shotgun handy.The performances are great, particularly Mantegna, and the film succeeds in transporting you to a section of New York only otherwise known as the home of the Mets.The film succeeds in showing how these friends truly care for one another and has almost as many precious moments as another cult classic (although less steeped in mythology) ""The Wanderers"". These are the moments you want to look back on. These are the friends who will always love you. This is a movie which feels good to watch."
5,Great Movie,"Funny move and good satire on the recruiting process in major college basketball. Lots of well-known basketball names involved (Boeheim, Tark, Pitino, Knight, Shaq, Hardaway, etc.)."
5,"Lights, Camera, Action!!","I saw this movie for the first time about a year ago, and I never get bored with it. It's full of action, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I thought Ice-T played an excellent role. If you're looking for adventure, try this one!"
1,Surviving the Lame,"Pity must have moved me to give this sorry movie even one star. It sucks, period. Please don't waste your time. Rehashed plots, horrible direction, script, and acting. Wow, I take the one star back!"
1,Ice T should have stuck with rapping.,"Jeesh. What makes all these hip-hopers wanna desperately become movie stars, have no acting ability with a carry-over effect on their music? Why? So they can star in movies like this and ""Friday?"" Didn't they make enough money rapping? Didn't they already get all the girls? Now they go down in history as awful actors who were just pretending to be gangsters in their music.This movie is so bad it pains me to think of it. O.K. One scene Ice-T gets SHOT in the gut from about 20 feet away with a rifle. I kept looking for a bullet proof vest, but couldn't find any. Next thing you know, He's wrestling and running like nothing ever happened to him, and the hole in his stomach is never mentioned again. Now, do you see why I give this movie 1 star?"
3,I used this for my English 9 class,"I'm a teacher in a urban school district and at times it's hard to get young people's attention. This movie goes great as a supplement to the Short Story ""The Most Dangerous Game""..same premise..great attention getter!!!"
2,Rutger derserves better plots,"This was a very disappointing movie. Rutger plays a ""bad man"" quite convincingly but the plot was very thin and the direction was VERY bad. With an all-star cast this could have been a good movie but wasn't. I like Rutger very much, but it seems he makes two types of movies: very good and very bad. The more of his movies I watch, the more I see how under-rated he is by producers and film makers. He is a terrific actor but he needs good plots and good direction."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I was glad that I was able to find this video. We love the old Ray Stevens songs and they're on there. The quality of the video is not great; I guess it was redone from a VHS. I still enjoy it because he's so funny. For the price, it was a good value."
5,From the Publisher,"""Millions of us have loved B. Kliban's Cat for a couple of decades now, ever since we were first introduced to the frolicky feline in the mid 1970s through the now-classic book 'Cat.' Kliban's Cat is one of the most beloved icons of popular culture. The drawings and paintings Kliban created have lost none of the appeal that first grabbed us back then and that continues to grab initiates today.""CatDreams brings together the joyfully mesmerizing paintings Kliban executed for a series of calendars first published between 1977 and 1981 and juxtaposes them with many of his irresistible cartoon drawings.

4,Book presentation,"TRY THIS ONE FOR SIZE, 1980When Claude Kendrick, owner of a shadily-run art gallery in Paradise City, was approached by Ed Haddon, the King of art thieves, to find a buyer for a priceless icon of Catherine the Great, he thought his greediest dreams had come true ! For Herman Radnitz, the multimillionaire, was prepared to pay six million dollars. But there was a catch : Radnitz wanted the icon delivered to Zurich as part of the deal.To his joy, Kendrick learnt of a couple travelling to Europe. All he had to do was make sure that the icon was planted on them unawares... the couple in question were none other than Detective Tom Lepski and his pretty wife..."" The old maestro's magic story-telling never flags. ""BIRMINGHAM EVENING MAILhttp://jameshadleychase.free.fr"
2,longwinded and dull,"A dead pull from start to finish. My feeling is that people tend to overpraise Rushdie's novels as a kind of celebration for having plodded through them. How depressing to spend a week of your life laboring through a narrative that just ultimately wallows in the fetid stink of its own self-absorption. Rushdie doesn't allow his characters to reveal themselves to us, electing instead to drool words, relentlessly, carelessly, sloppily, mercilessly. He tells us everything without ever showing what it's like to be one of his characters. For a novel purportedly grand in scope, this one feels suspiciously like navel-gazing."
5,His greatness,"Most writers, if you liked their book a lot you have to reread it to get that same experience. Not with Salman Rushdie. If you read ""Midnights Children"" and loved it, you can read ""Shame"". If you liked that, you can read ""The Moor's Last Sigh."" I read all three with a few years' spacing and that is how I recommend it, for thematically and in style the three are very similar. But each time you're in for a dazzling experience. Not for the linguistically challenged, however. If you are Rushdie you speak English, Indian, Latin, Greek, French and Italian, and blend all those into Rushdian, and that may put some readers off. But what's wrong with a dictionary anyways? Recommended!"
5,The Moor's Last Sigh,I am so happy that I rediscovered Salman Rushdie. His stories are a delightful mixture of many cultures and mythologies with a very strong underlying theme of justice.
1,if I could I wouldn't give it any star at all,"I usually read a book in a week tops, this book took me over one year (believe it or not) to finish, and I only persisted out of stubborness... This is simply the most boring and the dullest book of all times. The story is furthermore so complicated to read, one loses track of the family all the time. The story was slow and badly written, I cannot believe the author has such fame..."
3,Good but not Great,"I enjoyed this book, but didn't love it as much as I hoped to. Rushdie seems to try a bit too hard at times to write literature. He does have some wonderful moments, though, and some very memorable phrases and use of words in the book. By the end of the book I was anxious to find out what happened but also ready for it to end."
3,"great style, but plot overload","I read this book last minute for an English project, and, although perhaps I would have enjoyed it if I read it more lesurely, I found that by pg 300 I was screaming for it to end. The wrting style is very interesting, although Rushdie did seem to lose it in the middle of the novel and was just telling a story. At the end of the novel we learn why the main character is writing, and it seems to me that Rusdie excuses himself for stretching out the book as much as he does.If I read this again it will be in a few years, when I have the power to put it down for months at a time so I can get over being sick of each and every one of his family members."
2,Not too good for Vegetable,"This may be a good product for cooking meats , but for vegetable cooking it is an average pan ..."
3,Nice car seat,I researched several pet seats before purchasing this one. It arrived with a broken strap so I substituted a shoulder strap from a piece of carry on luggage for the lower strap which made it very secure. I called the manufacturer and they shipped me a replacement strap immediately but I'm still using the luggage strap. The seat was easy to assemble and install. My only complaint is that the safety clip is a little flimsy and difficult to secure to a wiggling dog... it would be better if it was more like the clip on a leash.
2,plastic broke,My french bulldogs dogs are around 24 lbs. The plastic tube that the two supporting tubes fit into broke right out the top. It should have been metal.
3,Heavier Duty Hooks Please,Love this booster seat except the hooks on the straps broke almost immediately. I ordered the small but was barely big enough for my 13 pound Shih Tzu. Please improve the straps and hooks!
3,How do you secure dog in this seat?,"I just received this booster seat for my 13-lb. yorkie poo. I installed it in the front seat of my car but can't, for the life of me, figure out how to secure my dog into the booster seat. Can someone please clue me in? Thank you."
1,Mystery Thriller,"Sorry, but I do not agree with the other reviews. This book reads like and old detective novel. Totally boring. Macho character doing the impossible.I was so bored with it I almost did not finish the book. Unusual for me as I read constantly. Hope this review saves someone the purchase price."
5,Excellent Movie-Powerful Witness!!!,"This is an excellent movie! I saw it a few years ago and then again recently on TBN. The acting was truly superb and very convincing, too. Although not of Asian descent, I work in cross-cultural ministry with Asian-American college students and young adults. So the cultural things in reference to China were very helpful.More than the above, I think this movie is a very powerful tool for evangelism. Many modern day Christians in America should see this movie. It will strengthen and challenge your Christian faith beyond measure. I'm glad that this movie is still around and still being shown on t.v. ..."
3,Very Touching,"The Church in China is changing at rapid rates; this documentary only catches a small glimpse that was perhaps more accurate in times past than it is of present-day China. The Church is still facing great persecution today, but is now beginning to suffer from the vast amounts of heresy being imported from many churches in the West."
5,you won't regret this purchase,whoa. you need this. the band is stellar; the dudes in the band are REAL GOOD PEOPLE; and the country they live in (norway) will rejuvenate your heart if you travel there.
4,If you love GTA...,"...You will really be into this game. You are are a gangster working for the Godfather who has to work your way up from being an outsider to eventually becoming a Don. In the meantime, you will be taking control of businesses by way of extortion, bribing the cops, and whacking rival families' gangsters. It is very similar to GTA in that there are main missions, side missions, free roam game-play, you can enter any vehicle, there are safe-houses, etc. All in all, it is very comparable to GTA except the music & cars are all very 40's and you cannot skip the cut-scenes. The game follows the first Godfather movie, and while I love the Godfather movies, I really don't need to see extensive scenes re-created in this game. Sometimes waiting for the action can be aggravating. Bottom line though, I would recommend this game."
1,I can't get the game to load.,"You know I would give this game a good review, if I could..you know... PLAY IT! This game is the worst when it comes to loading, or maybe I have a defective game. Before any of you losers comment that maybe my PS2 is crap. I have tried this game on 4 different PS2's so it's not just mines. This game I feel is defective.I can't take it back because BX policy states ""any opened video game and/or system can not be returned/refunded"" SO basically I'm screwed. I wouldn't sell the game to anyone because I would feel bad. So I have a game that I can't play.Let's compare: I have Socom 3, and the disc looks like it was buffed with sandpaper, and it PLAYS. I couldn't even get past the Paramount thing in the beginning with the stars going over the mountain... Yes its THAT bad.Hope you don't get a defective game."
4,Tony Chachere's Cajun Country Cookbook,"Has some good recipes. I have tried the banana nut bread & the homemade bread recipe, both were very good. But there are some recipes I will never make for example squirrel, rabbit, armadillo etc. But I would buy the book again, because of the recipes I have tried are good."
4,Exactly what I wanted.,Previously I had a tea ball that was not mesh but instead was just a tin ball with little holes in it. This was fine except for a few loose teas I have that are rather fine and so the tea would come out of the container when it was steeping. After reading plenty of reviews of mesh balls on here this one was the only one that a reviewer had said it does not lose hardly any tea if at all when steeping. So far that is correct.It keeps the loose tea inside and is pretty easy to clean.Only reason I am holding off on 5 stars is that I have not had it that long and so I do not know how well it will hold up after multiple uses.I make tea practically every day sometimes multiple times a day so I will update to 5 stars in a month if it is still holding up just fine.
4,Great for small baby claws,These are easy to use and remove some of the intimidation factor of clipping baby's claws. I call them claws because they're so sharp!
2,"Good idea, just doesn't work....for me","My problem with these clippers is that the jaws don't open widely enough for me to get the nail in place quickly enough. By the time you get them lined up, any movement of the nail to be cut leaves you clipping air. I never was able to make even one cut so they are now in a drawer."
3,Not what I expected!,"After losing some dexterity in my right hand fingers, I searched for fingernail clippers that were large enough to easily use. In a pamphlet from the Hartford Company, I found a listing for Steady Grip Nail Clippers. After searching on Amazon, I ordered a two-pair set.When they were received, I was very disappointed to discover that I spent so much time to purchase clippers to be used with infants!!! The clippers were way too small for adult use.I went back and reviewed my research and could not find anywhere an adequate discription of the product! Fortunately, both pairs were cheap enough that they have been donated to Goodwill."
4,Dont Underestimate Humour,"I am not a big fan of so called ""B"" movies, but after reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance on this one (I have spent more than 2.99 on rental films from other unnamed companies and have been disappointed). I must say that I enjoyed it. If you are still undecided, then maybe I can clarify a few things. This is a comedy and there are different types of comedies. If you like the sophisticated intellectual comedy of Woody Allen then this is not the film for you. BUT, if (like me) you enjoy the classic Montey Python style of smart slapstick humour mixed with National Lampoon's love of pretty young women in various stages of undress (without exaggeration), then you should find this very entertaining. Dispite what others have written here the story line is quite coherent (if you pay attention) and there are some very smart and cute jokes (i.e. one catgirl's description of the behavior of men). So if you enjoy smart slapstick humour I think you will enjoy this film."
1,What a hateful person,The author makes a living on the unfortunate circumstnaces of others. She is on a self proclaimed crusade of hate and pettyness. It is unfortunate that she does not really understand the delivery of health services.
1,Traveler's Italian CD Course,This product may be good for someone brushing up on their Italian but not for a beginner who is going to Italy. The phrases are mostly things you wouldnt need to know or say on a vacation. I have the Pimsleur Italian now and it is much more helpful (and easier). It is just a better format.
1,Stinks,"This book was terrible, filled with cliches. It was almost as though the author was trying so hard to be insightful that he missed the point of creating a portraits of politicans, people and Philadelphia. Don't waste your time or money because it just plain stinks."
5,Must read reality check ... and reason for hope.,"This book should be required reading for everyone who thinks that cities ""are not my problem."" The abandonment of the cities by suburbanites and the state and federal governments is nothing short of criminal. This book makes the reality hard to ignore while at the same time offering a sense that cities can become the jewels of our society. A rallying call for anyone who gives a damn"
5,A great book that will leave you shaken,"It is not surprising that this remarkable book has been overlooked in the Era of Good Feelings at the end of the century. We don't want to hear that there are people living in desperate poverty, or places where having hope for the future is a wasted effort. Buzz Bissinger takes us to a place left behind in our rush to the plasticized, homogenized suburbs. He describes a place, and people, who mattered when America made more than talk shows and toxic waste, but who are forgotten now. This is one of those books that will open your eyes and change your view of the world."
1,IT STINKS TO THE HIGH HEAVENS,Yeah i'd watch this silly movie and didn't understand one thing about it. Why don't they just spell it out and show what the bible say?
3,Good,Seller was prompt with processing and delivery. Product was not as good as expected. tried it for he first time and have found better eye makeup removers than Chanel's.
4,Dont expect the show even though there is a strong resemblance,Admittedly I haven't watched the original series in a few years but from this read I could almost picture some of the episodes. This is like the series yet it takes a few aspects in different routes. The ending on this was different from both the original series and the newer remade mini-series. While they changed that aspect it was done well and just as believable as if Patrick McGoohan had written it himself. Some episodes were omitted and some chapters didn't refer to the series at all.I enjoyed this short read and will probably re-watch the series and then read again. I think it is a nice supplement for any fan of the original show but shouldn't be held as an exact replica. This one borrows just enough to be enjoyable without being tedious and yes it does include Rover.
3,Good but not great,Jose Marti is a popular figure and it is beneficial to have various translations of his work available. This reader is useful but has some errors in the introduction and in the translations. The Selected Writings by Penguin in a better way to get acquainted with Marti's work.
5,As Promised,"As with most online shoppers, I did heavy research before purchasing. I simply could not afford a new one, but pined for a powerful KitchenAid mixer. This was a huge outlay of money for me and I was holding my breath til its arrival. Blemish-free, appears and operates like new, thrilled with this offering and very happy."
4,Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer,"I just purchase this item and I haven't regreted it. It's marvelous, whether is a big or small job. I highly recomended it."
4,Lubed my chain great,"This chain lube did the job. Not much else I can say about it, its chain lube, worked great for my bike chain."
5,I upgraded and am happy I did,My kids bought me a Fuji 4.0 megapixel camera for my birthday a while back. I loved that camera but wanted a little more MPs so bought this and am delighted. Even easier to use than my older camera.
5,An unexpected story but worth watching...,"I guess I didn't know what to expect when I rented this. I had no idea how much of a rollercoaster this story would become. I think it is touching that a lifelong friend would travel this journey just to give a little boy a story about the father he would never get to know. This movie will make you happy, sad, and most of all very angry. But, this story isn't one to ignore and I truly believe that so many can make a difference in making sure that the ending this documentary has doesn't ever, ever, ever happen again. I am sure that some will avoid watching this because it involves a highly emotional subject - but this isn't political except in the sense of a system failing a family. This is by far one of the best documentaries I have ever watched."
4,"Gripping, haunting, powerful","I would echo all other reviews of this documentary. It's emotionally raw and not easy to watch, especially if you have children. My only additional recommendation is that this should be rated R at least. I'm a grown man with two kids and this film made it hard for me to sleep the night I watched it. It's truly disturbing. I can't give it five stars because I reserve that for films that I consider truly great on many levels, but this is a great film."
3,Not the best,"The Duprees must have just gotten started when this was recorded, a lot of pitchy notes, I've heard them a lot better."
1,"low quality printing, margins are differ and NO TRANSCRIPTION","I disappointed with this dictionary, I ordered this one cause it has very good rating, but it appears to worth less then it cost:paper quality too lowprinting quality too low, it even hard to read some pagesmargins are differ from page to pagethere is neither russian nor english transcriptions, which makes hard to guess for learnersdefinitely not recommended"
3,Not so good,"I was hoping against hope, but at the price of this book, I'dthought I'd give it a try. I was hoping that the Russian to English portion of this book would also include the Russian alphbet, and how the letters are pronounced, and also the pronunciation of each Russian word. Well, I got what I paid for. Very little. Don't buy this book unless you are already quiteproficient in Russian."
5,My generation,"If you are a child of the 80s, you will be very happy with this CD. I listen to it often and remind myself of a happier playful time in life. It is definitely good for a trip down memory lane."
1,Too hot to handle,"Handle got way too hot to pick up after boiling water. For some reason they don't have the rubber going all the way around the handle, so the sides of the handle are metal and heat up. I burned my hand. Sent it back. Very dissatisfied."
1,Poor Design,"I bought this tea kettle as a gift for my husband and it has been a constant source of irritation for him. The spout's design is so poor that it splashes hot water all over the counter or stovetop every time he pours. We love the color and the physical design but will be replacing this tea kettle since it does not perform well. After all, isn't function more important than looks?"
1,DREADFUL PRODUCT - MELTING SILICON,"We were given this product as a gift. ""Kitchen-Aid"" branding creates impression of a reliable product. The tea spout lift and the water hole cover--have melted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a dreadful product!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Flaking on the inside,I have had this teapot for 3 years and did not have any problems until it was accidentally put it through the dishwasher (instructions say handwash only). Now there is some flaking of the coating on the inside of the pot. Haven't found anything on the web of whether this is hazardous but I'm worried about using with this flaking.
2,Ugly Furniture,"The furniture in this book is flat out ugly. I wouldn't pay $20 for most any of the pieces at a garage sale.Most high-school freshman can make vastly superior projects in wood-shop class.On a positive note, the author's instructions are fairly clear and easy to understand. However, since I will never make a single piece of furniture found in this book, I hesitate recomending it."
4,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,This dissertation fits precisely with my experiences of successful and unsuccesful teams over many years of business experience
5,"Great book, thoughful and fun.",Resurrection by Tucker Malarkey is thought provoking and gripping. That combination gives it tension beyond the narrative. The subject matter has implications for both our use of knowledge and for our desire to control it. I found myself rooting for Gemma and admiring her tenacity. I look forward to Malarkey's next work!
3,Resurrection,"The plot of this informative story in the style of THE DA VINCI CODE is a bit tedious, maybe because it has been done too many times. However, the presentation of the revelations and discovery of the Gnostic Gospels is interesting and informative. Set in the 1940's, the time when the scrolls of these ancient gospels were discovered at Nag Hammadi, the characters struggle to discover the value and truths of the lost gospels, while church supporters try to hide them and what they mean."
2,It Coulda Been a Contenda!,"This could have been a real page-turner, if there was more action. This is a fictional history of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi codices in Egypt in the 1950's. The premise is great, but the book just does not deliver. The author spends way too much time on the emotional status of the gospel-seeking herione. Her feelings about her father's death, her feelings about her love for her two half-brothers are part of the uneasy pathos we have to suffer through with this woman. The book is slow-paced and unconvinving,ultimately ending with another Mary Magdalene story. Gag. Quite frankly, I'm tired of all the Mary Magdalene stuff - can all these authors get off that Da Vinci caboose? I'm giving this a two-star due to her interesting topic which had the potential to be a thriller, if it had not been so predictable. The author has also done alot of research to her benefit, however, with some minor details which were flawed."
2,Some things are better left to memory,"I purchased this because it was the last appearnace of the Daleks and I wanted to let my son see what the big fuss was all about. I forgot how tedious some of the Dr. Who episodes are! My son couldn't sit through the entire thing, but I manged to slog through it. All I kept thinking was that Sylvester McCoy really could have used a good cleaning for his teeth, especially with all of the close-ups he was given. The story was not very exciting, but the commentaries included in the DVD edition were quite interesting. This is for real Dr. Who fans only."
4,One of the Better McCoy Bits,"Calling this one of the better Sylvester McCoy stories -- a repertoire that includes suck dreck as ""Delta and the Bannermen"" -- isn't saying much, but McCoy displays a charm and effectiveness that belies the oft-horrific dialogue he was saddled with. I actually enjoyed his Doctor more than Peter Davison or Tom Baker, and I thought ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" was superior to ""Genesis,"" ""Destiny"" [one of the worst Dalek stories IMHO], and ""Ressurection."" The audio commentary is nice as well. Would have liked to have seen a few more Sly episodes... if he had succeeded Davison, the show might had never been cancelled."
2,why this one?,"I am a HUGE Doctor Who, and unlike many people, I enjoyed Sylvester McCoy's episodes quite a lot. I was thrilled to hear more episodes were being released on DVD, but bewildered as to the choices made.. Surely, 'Robots of Death' and 'Caves of Androzani' are classics, but this episode was pure junk. Boring and tired, this truly signaled the end of a phenomenon. I think I would have rather seen every other McCoy epidsode on DVD but this one.I will say one good thing- the extras are much better than on the ""Caves"" DVD, and the extras are far more interesting than the actual episode itself."
3,Okayyyy... but,"I like Trudeau's work, but I did not find this as funny or engaging as earlier books I have by him. My favorite is probably 'Give Those Nymphs Some Hooters.' I like this for the digs on W, but the rest of the material is so-so. Maybe he's losing his touch, maybe I'm losing mine."
2,Stainless steel sport bottle.,"The sport bottle leaks. When you try to drink from it, it spills on you. I thought I was ordering the Maxam Sports Bottle. It appears, I got a generic."
2,Some Interesting Tidbits,"Anyone knowledgable about Hemingway would know that a book about his involvement in WWII would not be flattering; he was clearly playing soldier in a pompous self-important way. But this book, while it has interesting tidbits (without any references), has a bizarre obsession with Hemingway's impotence. Also, it seems that the writer begins to fancy himself a ""great novelist"" himself, what with his repetitve, melodramtic references to the ""Factory of Death."" Maybe he got co-opted by Hemingway, much the same way the people in his book that he criticizes did. If you can avoid getting irritated by this, it is an interesting read, although you wonder how much of it is factual."
2,Good; until you get going.,"I chose this player after reading countless reviews and comparison to many other players. I decided to disreguard the warnings that it just stops working one day. Then one fatefull bus ride on the way to school, my YP-T7X stopped working. I spent hours trying to revive my $100 investment. But it was no use; with my warrenty out, I had a useless pile of plastic and metal in my hands.On a lighter note it worked extremely well while it worked. Music was crystal clear, far better than any CD player I have listened to. The FM radio had poor reception, but considering I live in the middle of nowhere it was to be expected. The voice recording was great, gave me a chance to sleep during class, just record my teacher's voice and take notes later. I never used the photo viewer.All in all, its a good little; I mean little, player if you willing to take the gamble. I would advise finding another player, that is more reliable."
3,See newer model,"Look at the YP-T7J models. I believe they are the replacement for this and are execellent, although Samsung seems to be saving money on them by now supplying garbage earbuds and relying solely on a USB port charging system"
4,Great subscription player,"I tried the iRiver equivalent, but the interface was terrible and I had problems after I flashed the firmware (look at the discussion forums). I then bought the Samsung, and it has been a dream - great price, size, sound and interface. No support for playlists (hence, a 4), but I haven't needed them with the built in ability to select by author. I am using it with Yahoo Music. The Samsung and Yahoo are a perfect match. Note - if you use podcasts go with the 1Gb model, 512Mb is not large enough."
3,"Clip shows! Big, bold, sassy, and brassy!","Remember all those old sitcoms that would take a whole episode to go over previous episodes like some kind of narcalyptic amnesiac? Well, if you're a Gundam fan, then you'll eat this up like candy! Miller's Report is an OVA one-shot that was released after the original Gundam 08th M.S. Team anime series and recaps some of the background on commander Shiro Amada and his platoon of mecha pilots. Alot of what went on in the first part of the series is recapped, but has some new footage added on to it. Not much here though, but there are some cool bonus clips dubbed in English from the Playstation Gundam games."
5,READ THIS BOOK !,"This book was a blast to read. If you have the misfortune of dealing with the public, you will relate to Carl Fellows in his struggles to deal with crazy customers,incometant coworkers,the neighborhood devil worshippers and life in an old summer rental. Amazingly he manages all of it and his sanity too.This would make for a great TV series......"
4,Great reinforcement after Spanish lessons,"My three year old little girl likes to play with her Dora Leap book after our lessons for Spanish. We use the curriculum I developed, and she enjoys that many words from the activities in her workbook are repeated in this book. She says, ""Just like Flip Flop, Momma!""So the reinforcement, and confidence building is excellent, and I think it's a great intro as well, for any Dora fan.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
5,The most infomative travel guide we found on Santa Fe!,"We found this book to be very, very informative on where to go in Santa Fe as well as fun side trips complete with a ""how to find the onion lady"" on the road from Taos. Fabulous photography. Great historical and cultural detail as well. Highly recommend the Compass American Guides."
4,Love Bites,"I think this series is very entertaining--I love the Argeneau family! The combo of suspense, romance, humor, etc. reminds me of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. It is not has ""hardcore"" as some of the other vampire series out there, but definitely worth reading. I have read the first 4 in the series and look forward to the rest!!!!"
4,A frog's a frog but a good frog,Funny title but I think about my frog often during the day. The title alone keeps the information at the forefront of my mind (have to go eat my frog!!). Book well written. Many things I already knew but needed my memory jogged.Anxious to finish it and it's certainly a re-read.
4,All frog diet,"""Eat That Frog!"" is a quick read and a thought provoking book. The author, Brian Tracey, could probably have combined a few of the topics that are similar, but even without further distillation it is an interesting read.The basic message of the book is really decide what matters, pick the most important activities, figure out the steps to get results and start doing it now.Having summed it up in one sentence you main wonder if you need this book. I would say if you want to accomplish the most with what limited resources you have then this is worth the money. Each chapter includes short exercises that make you focus on what you really want and help you build an action plan to get it done."
5,Simple time management system that works,"If you are looking for a simplified time management system that gets results, look no further. Brian Tracy has simplified time management and as even added a Frog as a metaphor to stimulate you into action. Since reading Eat That Frog, anytime I want to put things off, I visualize that big ugly frog going rivett, rivett (you can't do it in froggie talk) and I get about it and getting it done.Don't judge this book by it's size. It's powerpacked. But only if you use it."
5,To the Point - The Way I Like It!,This book is not in-depth and does not waste time on figuring out all the psychological reasons why people don't get done what they want to get done...and that's what's so great about it! I read a little bit of this book everyday and it motivated me to stop wasting my time so much. If you want some quick tips and simple methods to help manage your time then this is the right book for you!
2,Good for an audience in sales and/or management,"Eat That Frog! (like many other motivational books) contains several good ideas--make that big important scary project ('Big Ugly Frog') your priority; list all the steps to your BUF and which steps depend on which other steps; use daily planning lists to prioritize your day; write things down; etc.... Unfortunately, it suffers from the old adage, ""What is novel isn't necessarily good, and what is good isn't necessarily novel.""For someone in the business world with underlings to take over all the 'low value' jobs you'll discover you are 'wasting time' doing, what Brian Tracy has to say might be motivational and inspiring--for someone who is is currently in the position of BEING the underling the upward moving boss is pawning off the 'low value' jobs on (or someone not in the business world at all) this book is likely to be depressing at best or angering at worst."
4,"Not deep, but useful, focused and on target, You need it!","This book isn't a new take on time management or efficiency. Instead, Brian Tracy, a man who's own success speaks pretty loudly, takes some of the best wisdom out there on the topic and puts it in a compelling form. This is important beacuse time management is about more than having the right information - it's about putting that information into action. Tracy puts the same message of prioitization and focus in front of you in a form that challenges you to take action. Highly reccomended, but you have to be willing to use this book, not just read it!"
5,I ate the frog... and I liked it!,"I've had this frog sitting on my nightstand for several weeks now. It wasn't a particularly gross looking frog, it's just that I had too many other frogs that I needed to eat. Well, I finally sat down and ate it up...and enjoyed every minute of it! Yum! I now know that I will be eating many more frogs, even the really disgusting ones. I know how to sort them out so that I don't have to overeat, or eat the wrong ones first. (Can't have dessert before the main course!) I would recommend eating this frog to anyone who wants to be more successful than they already are. If you're content in your situation, then don't bother because you won't get the point."
1,Nothing new,I was very disappointed with this book. Usually anything written by Tracey is motivating. Everything in this book was coined by someone else. Absolutely nothing new and a total waste of my money.
5,Don't judge this book by it's size,"Eat that frog is only 125 pages and 12 chapters, but it is jam packed with powerful information that will help you overcome procrastination and reach your goals.Eat that Frog is like a personal coach that you can refer you again and again."
2,Colorization of B/W Favorites,"1. Thumb Fun (1952, McKimson; co-stars Daffy)2. Porky's Party (1938, Clampett)3. Patient Porky (1940, Clampett)4. Porky's Hero Agency (1937, Clampett)5. Bye, Bye, Bluebeard (1949, Davis)I came very close to buying this one. But, I recommend not buying it. ""Porky's Party,"" ""Patient Porky,"" and ""Porky's Hero Agency"" are computer-colorized. Leave them in their original form!"
4,Cute and comfy,I have these shoes in three colors and can wear them all day long with no discomfort. The heels are a bit shorter than I prefer but the Nuncio is stylish enough to look sophisticated and sexy to make up for the heel height. They don't last forever but at this price I will keep buying more.
3,Good Business Shoes,"If you're looking for discreet and comfortable shoes for work, these are the shoes for you! If you want something more fashionable and sexy I suggest looking at shoes with higher heels. I got these in black faux snake skin and they are gorgeous! Shiny but not too shiny.I was really concerned about the sizing before I bought them. I'm usually a size 9, and after reading the reviews I decided to buy a size 8.5 M. The shoes fit fine, but they do have a slender form, so I wonder if a 9 M would have looked better. However, I think if I bought my normal shoe size, they would slip all the time and that's SUPER annoying and embarassing. In summary: I suggest buying a half size smaller if you have narrow feet, if not, buy your normal size and you can always buy heel cushions later if they slip."
4,Comfy heels,These shoes are really comfortable. They have a low heel so they're easy to wear all day. Plus they look great with both jeans and work slacks. I had to return the first pair I ordered because the inside sole was loose but amazon was great and exchanged them no problem!
3,Everyday Shoe,"I bought this shoe as an ""everyday"" work shoe. It's a good fit and moderate length heel that is very comfortable. My only complaint is that the inner layer of the shoe that your foot rests on has already come loose causing my foot to slide in the shoe."
2,Not Crazy About These!,"First of all the shoe is tight fitting. I usually wear a 9.5 or 10 and I ordered the 10 and they still felt tight in the toe area. Also, when I ordered this shoe, they did not have a picture of the fabric for this color so I was taking a gamble by ordering them on color name only. Needless to say, I didn't really like the fabric either. I returned them."
2,poorly made,The silver Nuncio pump appears poorly constructed. The heel looks poorly made and appears like it was glued on and the silver coloring (which is almost a glittery/snake skin look) appears cheap looking. I believe the other pumps (i.e. the leather finishes)are probably constructed better
2,"Comfortable, but too pointy.","These shoes look great online and I was really excited to try them on. When I did, they were definitely comfortable and they fit very well, but unfortunately the toe was way too pointy for my taste. It made my foot appear an inch or two longer than it actually is and it just looked silly sticking out from my pant leg. As much as I wanted to love these, I had to return them."
2,Slow Moving,"This book starts out well, giving a glimpse into what the world would be like without an American Revolution. It was fun just to look at his alternate world map. However, the pace of the book was very slow. This book might have made a decent short story, but not a novel. The characters are not that inspiring. I was also dismayed to see the few remaining patriots portrayed as racist terrorists. I find it hard to believe that even had the revolution of 1776 failed, colonies would not have sometime later fought for their freedom. Portraying the British as the good guys was more than a bit disconcerting."
1,The hopes and dreams of the left leaning Richard Dreyfus.,"As one who both loves the past writings of Harry Turtledove and viewed the typical trendy leftist expressions of richard dryfus I should suggest they both stick with their own talents. This book proved to be slow, disjointed and full of contradictions in plot and effect. To have the latter day founding fathers expressed as a bunch no better than today's militia fruitcakes is an insult to freedom loving people. To see that science has not been stimulated beyond gas filled balloons and AM radio is proof of the tremendous contributions our great country has acheived. I gave the book to a freind who is a British citizen who is a monarchist; she loved it but expressed dismay that America had been displayed as stagnent and unimaginative. This is the only Turtledove book worth guiding a wide berth around. Mr. dreyfus should go back to acting and making dismal comments on sad, sad ""Politically (In-?) Correct""."
2,What a Mess,"It's too bad that Bilal chose to direct this himself. Another director might have been able to keep the story on point. While the visuals are well done, they are highly derivative (Blade Runner anyone?) and they are not enough to make this sloppy story worth watching. Were this a longer format piece, it might be better in that all of the random tangents would eventually be given the opportunity to pay off, but as it is Immortal's just a beautiful mess."
2,Thin stuff,"It was first a comic book, but the translation to film doesn't make the grade, and after watching the special effects and the play-station quality computer animation supplementing real people, the disc gets filed under ""only in case of extreme last-resort boredom"" at the back of the DVD-otheque. The vision of 2090 New York is dark and ridiculous, the discontinuity with the present abrupt, the introduction of fantasy homoerotic Egyptian gods just plain silly. The dialogue is juvenile, but the sexual portrayals of rape are definitely not. All in all, not worth seeing if you're past the high-testosterone post-puberty phase, and even then it might be more interesting to watch the tumbling of clothes in a front-load washer and use the imagination to make sense of it. Could it cure insomnia? Quite possibly."
1,"One Star for the Title, Zero for the Movie","I have read the reviews that rave over the comic book or the director. However, if neither of those are household names to you, this is the worst thing you could spend your money on. Unfortunately I was familiar with both, and I make the same statement. A 2nd year film student at UCLA could whip out a better flick than this over a weekend. You might even understand it. Which you will not do with Immortal. The premise was unique, the story line fascinating, but that didn't matter, nothing can save this film, except taking the advice of those who say don't buy it. Don't Buy It."
1,Bilal worst movie to date,"Mr Bilal, please step away from the camera! Your books are so good but your movies are just bad! I have the original comics trilogy at home and read it so many times, i know different layers for each of the characters. But the movie is a HUGE waste of time and money. Even Bunker palace Hotel, in all it's medicority, was better than this one."
4,Old fashioned future,"In short the plot is the following one : there is two stories in parallel :- An egyptian god is sentenced to death and has seven days for impregnating a pretty female in order to survive through a son or a daughter.- a corrupted politician implicated in the traffic of organs is trying to kill a rebell (Nikopol), released accidentaly, after he had been frozen for thirty years; the politician is afraid that Nikopol knows too much about his illegal activities.- this rebell and this female fall in love each other.The film is aesthetically beautiful mixing several visual influences (Tarkovski's Stalker, Cocteau's 'Testament of Orpheus', the aesthetic of the Bilal's comics and also coming from his earlier films); the film is not truely action packed but rather atmospheric."
1,Not HD,"There is a reason this is so cheap. This is not a HD transfer but simply the DVD version upscaled to 1080p and put on Blu Ray. There is no HD detail here, instead lots of aliasing and other artifacts. You have been warned."
3,Meh,"This movie has a wonderful premise. I just feel that there were a lot of unfinished ideas that left too many questions open. The main plot itself was really thin and had a lot of holes, but was a fresh idea. If fully matured, this could've easily been a fantastic movie. Really cool visuals, though. Probably would've made a much better video game."
2,Wait till it's a cheap rental if you must see it.,"I don't know how people figure it's like 5th Element, cause there really is no similarity, so don't rent it expecting a good flick like 5th.The movie it's self, is mostly CGI, including many of the characters, and not the best either. They try to merge it with real actors, for so so results. Neither is there anything stunning or exciting in the visuals.The movie it's self, was easy to follow, but rather boring. Revolving around one character who is a big mystery, and turns out to be a disappointment. But hey, it has a cool looking cover right?"
2,Unfinished,The film looks unfinished. The animations are uncompleted and the film struggles to hold a story running.However; it has some interesting sci-fi features which makes the film worth watching... If you are a sci-fi fan with waaay to much spare time; that is!
4,Worth the price,"I am very happy with this purchase. Height is OK, simple to use, and looks very professional for someone like me on a budget and only doing casual video recording. Only fault I have with the unit is that it's a little tight to tilt up or down. This problem might not be evident if you are using a heavy camera or camcorder. I will try lubricating it witha little WD40 for smoother movement.However, do not let this little problem sway your purchasing decision, because overall it's a good product for the money.I would recommend it to a friend/family member.MMG...."
3,Light use tripod. It's not as durable as it appears to be.,"Well, I've had this tripod for 4 months now. I hoped (like many others) that it was a solid aluminum beast, but the truth is, it isn't. It's mostly hard black plastic. The plastic is OK, but it broke on me on the plastic where the legs connect to the central member.I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.The Sony name is good, but this product is relatively brittle. I would recommend it only for someone who will use it for light-duty purposes.I give it 3.25 stars (despite the fact that it broke on me."
2,Disappointed 80% plastic.,"Received the tri-pod yesterday, purchased based on positive reviews on Amazon, very disappointed. The tri-pod is 80% plastic. All the controls are plastic, how long will this last is debatable. The weight should have been a clue. Lesson learned see it in person first. Would not buy again."
2,This thing SUCKS!!!!!!!!!,"i got this tripod for christmas thinking it was going to be good because it looks to be but really, looks are deceiving and its not good at all. When ever you move the camera, it makes a sticking noise and is screechy. Im really disappointed with this, the head of it absolutely sucks and it is very shaky. I hope one found this useful."
5,Great Tripod,"This Tripod is great, it is VERY light and stable. I can't see how anybody can complain. Come on it cost $30!!!!!And it's a SONY.The name is worth $25 ;)"
4,"Useful, Entertaining, Uplifting","A book of quotations for the encouragement of the Christian walk, this book has comments from a wide range of theological sources. Many quotations are from Christians, but not all. The book is arranged by topics in alphabetical order (Death, Faith, Holiness, Home-Family-Marriage, Joy), with an author index in the back.Some quotes are rather humorous: ""I have spent a lot of time searching through the Bible looking for loopholes.""--W.C Fields, attributed during his last illness. Others are more profound: "" 'I can forgive, but I cannot forget,' is only another way of saying 'I cannot forgive.'""--Henry Ward Beecher.The variety of authors makes the book quite intriguing, compelling the casual peruser to stop for this one, and that one, and the next one: Rose Kennedy, Victor Hugo, St. Francis of Assisi, Billy Graham, H.G. Wells, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther, Pope Pius XII.This book makes a great reference, a beautiful gift, or a casual collection for plain old enjoyment."
3,"Cute, but they run small","These shoes are really cute, but they run small...to small to 'deal with it'. So, I just returned them and ordered 1/2 size larger. Now they are just great! :)"
5,Outstanding roadmap to increasing inner/outer safety,"This book was absolutely fascinating and filled with exceptionally practical, great advice. I didn't read the book for the physical safety part, although I felt it does a great job there. I read it for the inner, emotional safety part. It provides practical advice in a clear, concise manner on how to maintain energy, alertness and effectively handle negative emotions and negative people. It's well worth the money."
5,"Really, Surprisingly Liked It","I thought the book was a joke of some kind when I saw the sexy photo of G.L.Giles on the back, but then I started reading it, and I couldn't put it down. I felt so involved in the stories. I agree with the other reviewers. I want more!"
1,Overgeneralized and diappointing,"My expectations for this book were very high; but as it turns out, there isn't much substance in what could have been an insightful book into the world's major religions.The author repeatedly delves into Orthodox Judaism and tales of his parent's divorce. Very little meaningful insight into any other religion exists. Even when the author does attempt to give explanations of a particular religion, they are often far too overgeneralized to provide any real connection with its practitioners.In the absence of informative content, the reader is presented with an endless series of stories that are more reminiscent of an adolescent's journal than the expert writings of a serious scholar of world religion."
1,not what is advertised,"It's not that I didn't enjoy this to some degree, but the more I got into the less I enjoyed it. It is not as advertised. Goldman skims the surface of other religions and I really got the impression that he doesn't think too much of them. What this is is a story of how an Orthodox Jew came to terms with having a job that sometimes forced him to work on the Sabbath. If anything, his stint at the Harvard Div School in 1985 reinforced his own religion, and that is about it. Good for him, but it does not make for an elightened experience at all. With true ecumencial joining he would have given a little of himself to each religion that he covered, not simply ""reported"" on them, along with his feelings about individuals representative of each."
5,Sam's Review,This is a very educational product. Even some adults like it.I think this is a great product that kids can use and learn alot from it. Kids who are interested in dinosaurs can use this and they will learn and have fun at the same time.
1,not pictured,i ordred this product and it not what is pictured. what you get is a bumper hitch that mounts on bumper not on frame. i think its a false ad and they should picture the right style.
4,They always leave you wanting more...,"I do not regret my purchase of this DVD - I am a fan and a student of J.R.R.Tolkien and have been since I first read his books in 1973. Seeing him ""in person"" was a treat. And the illustrations by the Hildebrandt brothers who basically captured the essence of these stories for me thrilled me; I have been collecting their art for years as well. Unfortunately there just wasn't enough. Not enough interview time with Tolkien, not big enough view of the illustrations - there were over 50 of these but they were visually very small on the tv screen - as they were framed and the floated in the center of the screen. Interesting historical notes and comments and antedotes - just not enough, never enough."
2,Lame stuff,"Unless you're the sort of hopeless fan who swoons with delight at any mention of Middle-earth, this documentary is dreary stuff. The vaunted three-dimensional maps are rudimentary at best; the maps already in the books are far superior for conveying detail and flavor. As for the live-action interludes re-creating scenes from the books ... well, let's just say they're a little too middle school-ish for Middle-earth. The film clips of J.R.R. Tolkien speaking in his rapid-fire mumble leave one feeling sorry for the students who had to take notes during his lectures. The package is rounded out with kitsch-sodden calendar art from the Brothers H that makes one happy that Alan Lee's painting were the visual guidepost for Peter Jackson's films."
3,Good performance,"It is a good performance, but the 5.1 sound is no the best, in some moments the sound of the instruments are heard without presence"
5,"If you are a fan of Alice In Chains, This video is for you.","From the beginning to the end, this video contains every great song Alice In Chains ever put out, from ""Would?"" to ""Down In A Hole"". This shows the extreme talent of all of the band members. They combine a great performance with a little comedy. I give this a rating of five stars because I am a die-hard fan of Alice In Chains, and i had been waiting three years for them to put on the concert. It was worth the wait. My closing words: Alice In Chains fans, this one's for you."
2,"Nice concept, not very practical","There are conceptual books and there are hands-on books. This is serves me as a reader more as a conceptual one, especially when compared to ""Programming Game AI by Example "" by Mat Buckland, which has quick and fun examples. It's difficult to read for the casual reader. BUT, this does not mean, that it is a bad book, by no means, when I need new ideas for AI, I come back to this one and get new ideas, as it covers all techniques that I could think of, which should make it a good reference for the serious reader. The whole library behind it shows, that the author has invested much effort in this. So my final recommendation is to buy it together with Mat's book as both together make a nice team, especially so as Mat's book is easier to understand."
1,Worst mouse that I have tried in years,"I just bought this mouse about an hour ago. I thought, microsoft software will not have any conflicts and how bad can it be? The central button/mousewheel can be clicked 2 or 3 times before it actually responds. It is built of cheap plastic and would have probably survived one fall off the desk if one were lucky. With all the money Microsoft saves using foreign workers one could figure they would produce a quality product-- and one would be wrong. If you use it only for windows and spreadsheets, this mouse might be okay. If you are a gamer, buy something else"
4,Good but color not accurate,"The KitchenAid kettle is great. It whistles, pours nicely and cleans nicely. However the midnight blue is really a navy, which is not how it appears in the photo, nor on the KitchenAid website. Not being a huge navy fan I was a little disappointed."
1,A poor product,"This teakettle is very cheaply made-very thin-walled- the metal of the handle gets quite hot and I can't pick it up without potholder. Even the oddly-designed whistle cap is cheap, emitting a tinny squeak.I'm sending this back. The Circulon is much better."
1,Psion 5mx is a piece of junk,"I purchased th psion 5 mx in July 2000 and have never wasted $500 more effectively. I was unable to back it up on my computer and ot broke and lost all of my data. The customer service for Psion was HORRIBLE- I was passed on from person to person until I was told that there was no way they could replace my flawed computer, they would only repair it. After 2 weeks, I received my ""repaired"" computer, only to have it break again 3 weeks later. Once again, I've lost all my data. Fortunately, I have been able to back it up. Unfortunately, I don't have a psion on which to back it up and nobody at the Psion company has been of any help. I strongly recommend that anybody considering purchasing this product looks closely at other companies such as Palm and Hewlett Packard where the customer service is significantly better. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Perfect for travel,"Although I have a 3lb/12.1"" laptop (a Sony that I love), there are trips that I take for which that is just too large/heavy. For those times the 5mx is near perfect. I've edited text of a research paper on flights to and from Argentina. I've copied down the names of interesting books in the library of a B&B that I was staying at in Michigan. I checked email in a fleabag motel in West Virginia. The unit is a little pricey and isn't ethernet-able (the reasons for the 4 stars rather than 5) but otherwise it proves to be a useful travel machine. (It fits nicely in my inside coat pocket as well.)"
5,RCA Electro-Optics Handbook,"This is an excellent reference book for anyone that is working in the field of electro-optics. It covers subjects such asRadiometric quantities and unitsPhotometric quantities, units and standardsPhysical constants and factorsBlackbody radiationEye response and luminous efficacyRadiation sources and contentAtmospheric transmittanceDetection, resolution and recognitionLasersDetector characteristicsImage and camera tubesOpticsPhotographing E-O displaysThe subjects are comprehensive and detailed and explained in a simple manner.If you get your hands on this book and you work in the electro-optics field, then you would want to cherish this book!"
1,very bad!,"Sorry to say I could not bring myself to read more than one quarter of this book. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the dialog amateurishly written. The archeologists in the story behave like children and seem to have no more than a grade school education. I stuck with the book for as long as I did because the house at the archeological dig was supposed to be haunted, and I love a good ghost story, but the writing was so poor and the characters were so silly and boring. After the main character mentioned for the second time that her job was so dangerous and that she had been shot, stabbed, kidnapped, almost drowned, lost in a cave, and buried alive, I just had to quit! UNBELIEVABLE!!! I just couldn't read any more!"
4,ok for what they are really made for..pool table legs.,ordered these for equipment we were building. whoops!! they are plastic.. oh well i will use them on our pool table like they are built for.
3,For experienced only!,"This book has very good patterns. The only problem is that it has several mistakes. If you are experienced you will have no problem making the corrections. However, I would not recommend this to someone new to crochet."
1,Totally incorrect stitch count,"I got this book for christmas (it was on my wishlist after I saw it in the store) mainly because I liked the crochet patterns.I just sat down to try one of the knit patterns--""Celtic Waves""--which is actually a pretty easy feather and fan pattern. Or, at least, it *should* be easy. The pattern says to CO a multiple of 16st+3. So I got to row 4 of the pattern and did it stitch by stitch until I ran short of stitches on my needle.So I added up how many stitches you actually *need* on the needle in order to do it exactly as written, and it's 33.I really hope they publish an errata, because though I could easily figure out how to fix their patterns, I really shouldn't have to take the time to do that."
1,lots of errata - stitch counts are off,I bought this book as a design source only to find that there's lots of errata which make many of the patterns unusable...do take care.
2,I'd multi-pass on this one,"If you're looking for a fax machine that positively eats toner and mysteriously runs out of color ink, even when you've never once printed anything out in color, this machine is for you. To make matters worse, it refuses to run again until you replace said unused color cartridge with a new one, costing in the neighborhood of $....We use this machine as our office fax. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I like. There are much better alternatives on the market."
5,Enjoyable Read on a corporate killer,"I have enjoyed all of Mr. Lencioni's books as they are wonderfully entertaining and enjoyable air plane reads. However, this is the one I've shared most in that it exists in most every company and it allows the reader to see it in a non-threatening way. Read it and share it across the organization and up the leadership chain. If you haven't read any of Mr. Lencioni's business fables, start now and let the fun begin ."
2,Sprinting Through Tar,"I'm sorry - generally I'm a fan of business stories, but this one really missed the mark. In attempting to bring a sense of realism to his characters, it seems he focused too much on story plot and character development and not enough on the mechanics of politics and providing real examples of how to deal with it from all levels. I want ""take back to my desk"" application. This book fell short."
5,good book,"Leoncini's books are easy reads that contain useful insights for anyone in a leadership role in the business community. Highly recommended, especially for leaders new to the corporate world."
4,work great,works great. review guidlinesare crazy you have to use to many words just let us get to the point and submit.
1,oops,I have to reset the clock 3 times a week!!!!! Im never buying anything formRCA they make junk!!!it was pluged in to the charter cable box and the box will reset the clockI plug it in the wall and works fine :)
1,Didn't work at all for me,This product didn't work for me at all... I was very disappointed!!! I wasted my money on this product! BIG TIME
4,"Unthinkable but, sadly, all too possible","Unthinkable is largely a dialogue film, but it is a taut, face-paced thriller that poses a moral dilemma we may have to face in the not-distant future. For all those who insist torture should always be outlawed, what would YOU do if this situation arose? Would you turn Jack Bauer (or Samuel L. Jackson in this case) or Eric Holder? At times, Jackson's acting goes a bit over-the-top but still pleases. I did not recognize Michael Sheen, who looks little like his David Frost or Tony Blair characterizations, and he does an acceptable American accent. Worth watching and definitely worth thinking about."
4,The ending was EXCELLENT for realists,"Whining about the end not being ""happy"" is the opinion of fairy tail reading people with childlike minds that get disturbed by realistic things. Probably robbed of their ability to deal with the real world in their youth by religion inculcating parents; the result of said conditioning is an irrational desire if not outright need for FICTION to disorient them to the point of not being responsible for their actions.This story is obviously an entertainment fiction in which a homegrown nuclear terrorist is well prepared for his inevitable torture sessions which are illustrated as WAY over the top. I don't know enough about the REAL situations to be critical of what happens during prisoner interrogation. I do believe that for every enemy combatant you torture, you inspire a thousand more to violence against youGotta go! The Scamazon Gestshoppo and I don't agree on much as they also have an addiction to fiction and damn proud of it!"
5,Sadistic ... but look at 9/11,"Considering that a certain somebody whom caused 9/11 was just shot dead, I watched this film at an apt moment.How ironic ...I thought the movie was realistic with all the agencies not communicating / coordinating.Too realistic ...The world is not as it was when I was born, so I am grateful for having a good childhood.You have to do what you have to do when dealing with terrorists.They have no rules.Why should we?This is not a movie for the faint of heart.I found it thought provoking, but it wasn't over the top like Hostel.It requires thinking about psychology along with legal ramifications."
5,Requires perception beyond your eyes...,"It was 5 a.m. when I strolled across this movie. I saw Samuel L. Jackson and thought, I normally love his work. I must say this is not just direction and action; this is a piece of important information that should be broadcasted around the world. Everytime I assumed what would happened next, the characters took it one step further. In the end, I was left wondering. In these thoughts, I realized the movie was never about the chain of events. It was about the beliefs these people held so strongly, they were willing to do the unthinkable.This is definitely a must see for any free-thinker. If you are bound only by what you are told, do not watch."
2,Another VU compilation!?,"Another VU compilation!? As a VU fan, it's been very disappointing to know that there's a new VU compilation but contain the same songs on other VU compilations. Maybe the label should think of something different rather than repackaging and re releasing the same stuff over and over. The 2 CD set compiles some of the best VU tracks + NICO's ""Chelsea Girl"" that I think would be a very good introduction to some of the people who aren't familiar with the band at the best possible price but will be a disappointment for long time VU fans since it's just one of those VU stuff that has been remastered and released over and over! To the record label, please try to think of something new rather than exploiting people's money on the same stuff...."
3,Won't be reading it twice,"My father always says if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. I can say something nice about this book - the story is quite well thought out and there are some surprises. I thought the stalker idea was good and there are woman who can relate, I'm sure. But the book was let down by melodramatic writing and characters who did unbelievable things and reminded me of girls who were a real pain at high school. I had to make myself keep reading to the end. This is not a keeper."
4,"Entertaining , sexy 60's film","This is a surprisingly entertaining movie. It is almost quaint.Catherine Spaak, one of the most beautiful actresses of the 1960's is at her most beautiful as a widow who discovers her late husnband had an apartment that he used for kinky sexual escapades. She then decides to use that apartment for similar purposes and to live a more carefree sexual lifestyle.Movie is full of typical 1960's touches, from the art direction to the music. This is not, though, an explicit sex movie or even one of those late night Cinemax flicks. This is a fine, sexy, very entertaining movie.The VHS version of this movie was missing several minutes of the more naughty scenes. Luckily they have been restored for the DVD version. The print quality of those scenes is not up to par, but it is still nice to see a complete version. The DVD also features some ""Deleted Scenes"" and some amazing 1960's trailers from the Audubon Collection. They are truly fun to watch."
4,somewhat mistitled maybe?,"I will begin by saying this is a good intro to druidism. It is authored by a high ranking member of ADF, one of America's largest druid groups. It has some really good information. My downsids of why this was brought from five stars are:The last almost third of the book is about groups, which would be fine, if the title was different, in my opinion. Personally, I also wonder if a ""druid"" alone would be a ""druid"" or if they would simply be another title such as bard, ovate, seer, or along those lines following on the same path. This is not an insult, it is just to me a druid is a result of many years of long term study and practice, and they also historically are also qualified to teach. Otherwise, this book has good foundational practice, and seems to have good historical research."
2,Anti-Pneumatological,"Dr. Cottrell presents a fairly balanced view of Theology with extensive reference to scripture (an element often neglected). However, when he arrives at the role of the Spirit his text becomes harsh and narrow. The Spirit is restricted to sanctification, with the gifts of edification (prophecy, tongues and interpretation, miraculous healing) reserved for the apostolic era. He goes as far as to state that those that practice tongues are deceived and filled with an evil spirit. He does not state that they have lost their salvation but does suggest that these events have ceased - not arguing for or against, yet the declaration that these events could not happen and if they do are the result of demonic deception appears to great a claim to make, one which attempts to restrict God (as identified as father, son, and spirit) and labels that which may be God as demonic."
2,couldn't finish put me to sleep...,"was surprised I didn't wake up enough for all the contrived unecessary character confrontations and violence... I found Diane Lane the shining moment of the film and Dennis Miller a fish out of water but a welcome respite in the midst of a convoluted aimless plot.. Snipes is such a great talent, sorry he had to work up some lather for this stinker..."
5,Murder at 1600,A Washington D.C. cop investigates a murder in the White House and draws the ire of the Secret Service when members of the First Family become suspects. This movie has an interesting twist. I enjoyed the movie.
3,Murder at 1600 an Okay Film.,"Murder at 1600's strong point is that it has characters you want to care about. Wesley Snipes has this type of character nailed down as an ""officer just wanting to do my job"" (Detective Regis) as he's done in pictures such as Passenger 57. Diane Lane as Special Agent Nina Chance is once again great and beautiful as ever. The plot of the movie has some twists as a murder in the White House is used as a cover up (or not as a cover up) to disgrace the First Family. One complaint is, somehow Ronny Cox should have continued his run as a ""baddie"" (Total Recall, Robo Cop) in films. He and Alan Alda (as Alvin Jordan, National Security Advisor) should have switched roles in the film. Alan Alda should have played the President in the movie. Otherwise, a pretty good thriller from start to finish."
2,questionable attention to detail in the preface,"Rebecca lived through a lot of interesting things and knew interesting people, so if you're looking to read her letters, this is probably a pretty good collection of nicely typed out copies of them. I would disregard the preface since the editor, Bonnie Scott, has obviously not spent the time on attention to details and solid background information. If you want to read about Rebecca, I would recommend ""Rebecca West: a saga of the century"" by Carl Rollyson, who spent many hours at our home talking with my father and getting all his facts right over a long period of research."
5,Top Notch Anime,"I dont really know about teh other two reviews that dissed this series. Just opinions like anything else really. I really enjoyed this anime, animation is very good, story is fun, and action is good (could be alittle more) but still good. The english voices are common around other animes are they picked good ones atleast. If you are into AD police, Witch hunter robin, Gundam series, S-cry-ed, Getbackers, and the ghost in the shell movies, I think you will enjoy this anime. I was really excited that another anime is in anamorphic widescreen making it look great, and the speical edition versions have DTS but if you go cheaper you can still have 5.1 dolby digital which is good enough for an anime DVD."
5,Very moving book and document of 9/11 and its aftermath,"I found this book riveting from the very first page. This is a brave kid telling what it was like to be at Ground Zero for three long weeks. She writes simply, from the heart, but there is power in her earnestness. As a reader, I felt I was there experiencing each devastation or triumph of the spirit with her. Since the author now works with the families of Cantor Fitzgerald, she is to be commended for considering their feelings and not being as graphic as some other books. Believe me, she gets her points across without sensationalism. I found some passages chilling, and shed a few tears along the way. This author is an example to other young people of how to get off your duff and do something to help your fellow man."
5,Nothing less than great!!,"Math is my worst subject but with these DVD's I have been able to increase my proficiency. At times they are a little too remedial but they have helped me a great deal. Terms and procedures are explained simply and then practical demonstrations are shown. You cant go wrong here, they are well worth the expense."
1,Mom,"I bought a package of these years ago. I heated one up and ate it. It wasn't a good experience, and I never tried another one. The taste was boring and the texture was terrible. I tried putting butter on it; that didn't help. I ended up throwing them out when they got old. I've been afraid to try any of their other products even though some are sold locally."
2,Ugh!,"For all of you who loved this book I start out by saying that this is simply my opinion - Not Very Good. There were some funny moments in the book but I just couldn't connect with any of the characters - quite frankly they all seem like they were intellectually challenged. Beyond not caring a lick about the characters, I also found the plot to be a little lacking. It was a good idea for a book but I though it was poorly executed."
1,Don't waste your money,"Personally, I found the writing to be juvenile at best and just boring at the worst. I can't believe she has even one book published, let alone as many as she does. Extremely disappointing really Milquetoast Vamps. And poor writing to boot. The only reason it gets 1 star is because I have to."
4,A Better NBA Live,"I loved NBA Live 2005. I played it just about every day for almost 10 months. I got NBA Live 2006 as soon as it came out, and it hasn't disappointed me. The graphics look much better (the players look really realistic), the music is great as always, and they made the gameplay better. I haven't gotten up to All-Star mode yet, but the CPU plays a pretty strong D (you can't just spin move all day to get to the hoop), the DUNKS are awesome, and you can fast break without the CPU catching up (again, I'm not sure if this is the case in All-Star mode.I only gave it 4 stars because of a really annoying bug...on one of the load up screens, it hangs.Awesome game though! NBA Live fans should really enjoy it."
5,ILLEST Balla Game Dis Year,"Yeah mayne this game is sik , the gameplay is amazin , the graphics are much better then last year , also the players got there own unique shooting stylez like in real life 4 example Shawm Marion , thas sik in its own rite let alown the dunkin , thas somethin that this franchise always had great but it jus got better , and the passin is so much more realistic , and da dynasty is first ta none. this without ah dout da illest nba live in years. And the illest balla game this year. I Highly Reccomend NBA LIVE 2006 !!! THAS WAS UP !PS NEW YORK KNICKS 4 LIFE WORD UP !"
2,"Just a phrasebook, not language instruction","There's no guided language instruction here. It's just a collection of phrases that you may or may not find useful in certain situations. These are organized within a phrasebook, and the CDs contain audio recordings of native speakers saying the phrases so you can follow along. If you're going to Brazil, and you just want to memorize some canned phrases to use at the restaurant or the airport or while shopping, this book may be helpful for you. But if you're looking for more of a guided-instruction language learning resource, you should look elsewhere."
3,Like reading a long Wikipedia article.,"Love to read about art and artists so I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was not written like a novel but like a very long factual retelling. It was well written and interesting but as a novel I would have liked to hear more. It was like reading non fiction about John Singer Sargent. Since I didn't know much about him I found it an interesting read. Since I just finished several other books of a very similar nature I expected more. It doesn't compare to ""The Last Van Gogh"" or ""The Paris Wife"". They were more juicy and fascinating. That is why I gave it 3 stars. It can be read by all ages but probably wouldn't be of much interest to a teenager. Perhaps and art student would enjoy this. It is amazing how prolific Sargent was and how many paintings are available to view online. It will spark your interest to learn more about him."
3,Strapless (book),It took me awhile to get through this book (it was for my book club). It was interesting though. Not a real page-turner.
1,Tube blew upon inflation,"I was eagerly awaiting this purchase to get back on the road with my bike, so when the UPS man arrived, I immediately installed the tube. Everything looked good, but when I inflated to 40 pounds, it blew. Only thing I can guess is that the universal size is a problem. I needed 26x2.125 and it must get a little thin trying to fill up the volume inside the tire."
5,The BEST Drama Show!,"If you like suspense and drama all in one show, and especially an unknown ending of what may happen, here is the show for you. I was quite shocked at the clips that they can actually show on television. Don't miss this great thriller!"
3,Far short of Expectations!,"My family and I are big fans of Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, and Carnivale, and we got this series, hoping it would be as good. But it fell far short of our expectations. We didn't get hooked, and didn't feel compelled to watch any episodes after season one. There were so many places in this season where the writers could have played things out more--intensified the plot, heightened the tension, but they utterly failed. The writers also killed off some compelling characters too early in the game. I recommend, that if you haven't seen this series, rent it before you buy so that you can determine if it's for you."
4,oz-the complete first season,"love this series gritty and entertaining,take the sopranos and place them in a high security prison you've got oz. one of my favorites."
1,quality,"I was impressed the way they shiped the product. They made sure that the item would not be damaged.The movie was good shape, didn't skipp,or stop. However, the movie was edited. I was looking for the actual movie."
5,"We Aint in KANSAS anymore, Toto",Oz is the grittest prison drama (Prison Break is a close second). It is character driven morally play in weekly installments which makes this TV series more interesting for viewers.The prison unit (the in joke of OZ) is called Emerald Citygreat tv..great dvds
2,If Hearing Problem..... disappointment,Im only writing this to warn anyone who has a problem hearing and needs closed caption..... IN ENGLISH.... then you are out of luck. The only closed caption on this dvd is in Spanish... I had to return this because I have a hearing problem and need the closed caption...in English..
1,Poor Writing and Acting,"After seeing parts of episodes while channel surfing, I thought I'd buy this and give it a go. WHAT A MISTAKEAfter watching the first three episodes I am ready to bail.The prison staff actions and dialog are the problem...WEAKErnie Hudson keeps babbling ""If we don't stop this...stop that.... there's going to be a riot""The Candyarse 'Emerald City' councelor, Rita Moreno,this show comes off more like ""21 Jumpstreet"" goes to prisonCussing and nudity may have made this show controversial in it's time but after watching one episode of 'The Shield' the writing is so obviously inferior and the dialog sounds downright silly."
4,A bit dated and mellow,"Just watched season 1. I can imagine how this show was shocking and controversial in the 90s but in the world of post-24, this show provided just about enough blood and violence to keep my mind from wondering off to the contents of my fridge. It's really amazing how 24 has shifted standards and pacing of high-caliber shows. However, I remained interested in the show enough to buy the second season but for me it's more of an educational history of cable television-type of watching. I really hope it's gonna pick up.The most hillareous interaction in the season is the ""love affair"" between the Nazi boss and the lawyer. They're so sweet!If you still haven't checked out 24, HIGHLY recommend it. Watch it and OZ would seem like a summer vacation on the English Riviera."
1,Warning!!! Do not be Deceived by this Seller!!!!,"As written by another buyer from this seller they intentionally misrepresented this product as to being a full stack of CD-R's but in reality, it is only one CD-R with a shipping cost of over $7!!!! Don't be fooled by this rotten seller. The tiny single CD came in a shoe sized box filled with air pockets. Do not buy from this seller!!!!"
4,Title,"Great follow up to their first record. New versions of old songs are solid except for ""Mercedes Baby"" - where's the big metal finish from the original? This band is much better than most of the pop crap out there, pick this one up."
1,THIS HAS TO STOP!,"Great singers YES! But WHY are they going around singing the hits of the original Supremes? We're not stupid here ladies. Lynda Laurence was a REPLACEMENT Supreme for one year in the 70's, and then she QUIT, Scherrie Payne (a wonderful singer) was another REPLACEMENT from 73-77, but the other lady, Freddi Poole was NEVER a Supreme! She goes around saying that she is a Supreme. Give me a break! They have talent, but they are making a living out of a legacy that does not belong to them, especially Freddi. It rightfully belongs to Mary Wilson, an ORIGINAL Supreme, and the only one that cared about the group. Florence Ballard unfortunately is gone, and Diana Ross doesn't give a rat's behind about the Supremes. If it wasn't for Mary, Lynda (of all people) and Scherrie wouldn't be going around making money out of songs that rightfully belongs to and were recorded by Diana, Mary and Flo. This is just NOT RIGHT! If you want to hear ""DA GOOD STUFF"", buy the originals!"
4,A great holiday movie.,"I first saw this years ago and am glad to find it on video. A psychiatrist (John Pertwee, of Dr. Who fame) takes on the daunting task of psychoanalysing Santa Claus who is suffering an identity crisis. In the process they examine all the different myths and stories about Santa around the world and how they got thier start."
1,Poor quality never buy this iron,The iron stopped working within less than one month and only used 3 time and each time about 30 minutes. This is one of the worest product I ever purchased. Contacte Black and Decker and so far no response. Do not waste your money buy a better quality product. Amazon should take this products off their selling lists of product
1,Short Lived Steamer,"I liked this iron at first. Then the steam function dribbled off the court, so to speak. It had a great burst of steam for about the first five hours of ironing, now it is so slow that I am looking for a new iron.The ceramic sole plate is great. I melted a synthetic on to it accidentally and it wiped right off.Has a great cord that is long and connects with a swivel so it stays out of the way.Controls are easy to use and it heats quickly.Too bad about the Steam function...but steam is an essential component to a ""Steam Iron"", so it basically is a non performer in my book."
2,Power cord issue,We're on our second unit. The first was a lemon and replaced under warranty. This unit worked fine for the past two years until the power cord connection failed. It's on a swivel at the point of entry into the iron and there is no easy way to access the connection to repair. Junk-piled. Just wish there were irons that stand the test of time...
1,black & decker digital evolution iron,"still waiting. The very first time i tried to use the iron, I turned it on and the iron started to smoke. At first I thought it was because the iron was brand new. No such luck. It burn itself up. Black and Decker told me that they wanted the iron back, to examine it, and they would send me a new one, well that was six weeks ago. I called Black and Decker again. I was told the iron was on back order. I would receive the iron in approximately ten days. Well still no iron. I went to the Mall and bought a iron four weeks ago. still no Black & Decker.d"
1,Don't Buy!!! Poor Quality! Poor Customer Service from manufacturer.,"I purchased this product at a local retailer. Within the first 2 month of having this product a wind gust cracked the ""top elbow"" assembly. I called Bond Manufacturing to obtain a replacement part. They were totally uncooperative in obtaining the part.Not only do I now think this umbrella is poor quality, I also did not like the amount of space it took up on my deck. Expect to lose a about 35 square feet of your deck for the mounting stand and the swing of the umbrella arm.Bottom line - Don't buy this umbrella unless you like to toss your money in the wind."
4,Laser Challenge Radar Extreme,This was a great toy. The blast shield and max shot are awseome features. It isn't like some of the other laser tags that beep every five seconds. I also liked that it was compatible with the laser challenge V2.
1,Didn't recive book,"Never received book, but Woody's Books was very helpful despite not getting me the book."
3,Wrong book?!,I bought 0131436643 book(7th Edition). but you send me the book of 0130348341(4th Edition) which is wrong. I need to refund.Please tell me how to refund and send me the correct book. thank you
4,ECW Anachy Rulz 1999 review,"The Jerry Lynn-Lance Storm match was a back-and-forth,hard-hitting,high tech showstealer. The Jazz-Tom Marquez match was a 58 second stinkfest. The Nova/Chris Chetti-Simon Diamond/Tony DeVito tag team match was short and ruined by many interferences by many wrestlers. The Yoshihiro Tajiri-Super Crazy-Little Guido-3 way dance was a high-flying/solid match. The Justin Credible-Sabu match was a hardcore,hardhitting,bloody brawl. The Taz-Mike Awesome-Masato Tanaka-3 way dance for the Worlds title was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining match and the same goes for the RVD-Balls Mahoney-TV Title match. The Tommy Dreamer/Raven-Steve Corino/Rhino-World Tag Team title match was short but sweet. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
1,Dangerous recommendations!,"I just wanted to inform you that the anonymous author of this book recommends jelqing, vacuum pumps, etc. proven dangerous techniques and exercises. The information regarding health problems is very basic and easily available for free online. Moreover, it is insulting so expensive book to have many spelling and grammar mistakes as well as to be so cheaply and poorly made. There is simply no way anyone can be satisfied with such an imitation of a book especially when there are other books at acceptable price which are a lot better."
5,Very good,"I am an urologist and I was pretty amazed after one of my patients came to me saying that they got cured using the techniques described in this book. After reading it thoroughly I was really amazed and realized that those methods aren't bad at all. Now, I recommend it to all of my patients and it worries me because works like a real doctor. It might even replace me! If you have a problem related to sexual dysfunctions I totally recommend this book."
5,THe best thing ever,This is the best enhancement product available. It gives true results and is definitley a confidence booster. Every guy should try it even if they are happy with their size.
4,Is This It?,"Whatever the setting, whatever the personalities involved, whatever the class/background/idiosyncrasies of those involved, what this book does is confront sensitively and passionately the theme of 'Is This It??' The theme which happily-married-with-children couples are wont to consider when they achieve their social, familial and professional ambitions.What Faulks does supremely well is make Mary a sympathetic character, despite 'having it all' and wanting more.She invents passion for someone she hardly knows because she can't bear to accept that her life is settled and comfortable and she will never again know the excitement of discovery. All 40+ women who read this will love it!"
1,On Green D0olphin Street,"What a shocker. This book had to be the most boring book I have read in years. There are so many issues Faulks could have pursued yet he left every one of the hanging. What about alcoholism, diplomacy, politics, adultery, etc. This is certainly not up to par with past endeavor. It is nothing more than a trite love story."
1,UGH.,"Shooter is a no talent hack trying to get big off his Daddy's name. There is no comparison between him and Waylon, becasue Mr. Waylon Jennings was a true country hero with heart. PLEASE don't waste your time on this album if you are looking for a new country outlaw. All of these songs are polished pieces of Nashville garbage. Check out Hank III for some real new school outlaw country...I hear the new album comin out this month is gonna tear lil Shooter + all the shiny happy Nashvillians a new one! I would have given this album NO STARS if there was an option to do so."
4,Shooter,"This is Shooter's best cd he has. The best songs in my opinion are ""4th Of July"", ""Lonesome Blues"", and ""Sweet Savannah"". Unfortunately for Shooter he has gradually gotten worse with his next 3 releases. Shooter is kind of in the middle of country music, between pop and alternative country. I wish he would just choose to be an outlaw and quit trying to write a few songs for radio and make videos for CMT."
2,I thought it was cannibal holocaust,"This movie was kinda boring. I was looking for cannibal holocaust, but wasn't sure of the name. This movie had a couple of OK parts, but get cannibal holocaust it's much better than this film."
3,Finally...,"Okay, folks...you can finally toss out your 18 dollar Cannibal Apocalypse dubbed copy you got on from the hazy looking Japanese laserdisc. Or you can keep it for nostalgia's sake. Whatever the case may be, Cannibal Apocalypse is a definite must-buy. Starring B-movie legend John Saxon and Italian horror boy Giovani Radice aka John Morghen, C.A. tells the tale of a Vietvet (Saxon) who during his stint killing is bitten by ol' Johnny who is trapped in a tiger trap gnawing on some poor fool. Flash foward to Atlanta, Saxon returns to his normal life after the war and just as luck would have it, Morghen shows up and the two embark on a cannabalistic murder spree. As one could guess, this film was heavily edited, released under a number of different titles and was a Video Nasty favorite for years. Now you can find out why!"
4,clayton dove guitar pick-12 pk,"this pick is excellent but i gave it a 3 because its size isnt exactly as the picture shows it to be. in the picture the pick appears elongated....givinh it enough space where you could actually drill a small hole in the top area and be able to place a string through it to make jewelry on your own, rather than buying that particular pick already on a vinal necklace. but when i received them, they were shorter and wider at the top. that isnt so good either if a person has long fingers such as myself. its no wonder the pick would slip several times out of my hand since the gripping space wasnt as much. and i was using the picks on an autoharp right on the table. it shouldnt have been an issue with such a simple scenario."
1,Not the best basketball of all time,"a decent game, but hardly better then 3 out of 5. for that reason it gets a 1."
5,I absolutely love this video!,Oasis should be even more popular than they already are. They are truly brilliant. I say this because their b-sides blow away anyone else's a-sides. This video proves that they are one of the best bands out there. Everyone should own this video! Great songs and performances.
4,Mad fer it? Get this one first!,"Although ""Familiar to Millions"" tops this one for interviews, slick bonus material, and production value, true Oasis fans should get ""There and Then"" first. Why? Because Liam's performance here is much better.While the overall band performance on FTM is superb, Liam's voice is weak and disappointing. I hate to say that as I love this band, but it's true.""There and Then"", on the other hand, captures Liam at his best. You will keep watching this for the great live performances. The video shows Oasis at the peak of their worldwide popularity and it is magical.I keep going back to FTM to watch the hilarious interviews with Liam and Noel and to get a sense of the atmosphere at Wembly Stadium, but get this one first for the music!I should mention that I haven't yet seen ""Live by the Sea""."
2,Get Schaum's COLLEGE Chemistry instead,"I bought this and the Schaum's ""College Chemistry"" to get my HS son up to speed for his HS Honors Chemistry course. (I had several years of chem in college.) I found this one much too simplistic to the point of being confusing in that they leave out a lot. On the other hand, the Schaum's ""College Chemistry"" is just perfect. The worked examples in THAT book are clear and the text is fairly comprehensive. In THAT book there are lots of extra examples to work on."
2,It was OK.,"I got this game in a 2-pack along with equestrian challenge, and I was disappointed with this game pretty quick! There is not much to do, and the courses are hard to understand at first. All in all, I did not like this game."
3,Nikkon camera,I ordered this for my daughter and have not read it. It is designed to help those who use the Nikkon D100 Camera. I have a Canon Rebel.
3,Juan Rojas,"I love that shoes I bought for a gangster costume for my girlfriend she loves it, looks nice, but the material is not the best, and the hand made job is not the best, a lot of glue around the shoesJuan"
2,No one likes them,"We're getting used to how to manage these and aren't quite sure if we love them. To turn lights on or off, you tap the switch pad. Dimming or increasing brightness requires holding a finger on the top or bottom of the switch pad, and it adjusts a too slowly for our taste. We're going to give it 30 days and see if we get used to how to work these things before we replace them.After 30 days now the concensus is that we don't like them. You never know whether you're going to touch-and-hold to make it brighter, or dimmer. It's a 10-second process to dim or brighten the lights."
5,Outside-the-box theology,"I first encountered Capon in his engaging recurring articles for the Wittenburg Door magazine, then began reading his books. With many Christian authors, you know pretty much what to expect; you can place them in neatly-defined categories. Not so with Capon; he is a maverick free-thinker which means he's going to challenge the reader with his unique perspective. Here's my theory on Capon: no one reading him will agree with everything he says (there's bound to be something to bother you), and no one reading him will walk away un-blessed. Genesis:the Movie is a fine example of his fresh approach. And who said theology had to be stuffy? The scholarship is all there, but RFC's books read like an engaging discussion in a coffee-shop. They are full of life! I so appreciated his well-reasoned thoughts on this ""book of beginnings""."
2,Far from his best,I have read virtually everything Capon has written starting with Supper of the Lamb 25+ years ago and would rate most 4-5 stars. This was the only book I couldn't finish.
3,fun but poor quality,"playfoam is great fun, but imagine the dissapointment my little gift receivers felt when what they opened was half useless. The foam was dry and crumbly. Only about half was useable. I've subsequently found out how to make floam myself from online tutorials at instructibles.com.While this is a fun product what I received was junk. Obviously, either this brand was terrible or the seller stocked out of date or low quality stock.Make your own and save money."
3,It's OK,"My 4 year old wanted Moon Sand after seeing it advertised on tv. I of course had to spend hours (practically) checking it and similar products out to get the very best cuz that's how I am. I decided on this stuff because it wasn't as messy. That's true, but it's boring! It's been almost 2 months since Christmas and we still haven't used all the pastel colors. I was enthralled with it at first, making a ball and squeezing squeezing SQUEEZING it. Didn't last long. I made some letters, my son's name. We mixed colors together. Haven't touched it since. I think I liked it more than my son did.We'll go back to Play-Doh!"
2,Meh,I bought this for my son for Christmas because it was a great price and seemed like something he would really enjoy since he's into playdough. I couldn't have been more wrong. The packaging makes it look like you can mold all these amazing shapes with it. I guess if you spent hours upon hours you could make that happen...but a 4 year old won't stick around long enough for that (and neither would I). He's only played with the foam ONE time and has lost interest in it completely. It basically just ended up being a waste of money. I should have just bought more playdough.
2,Does it all but Hold Together!,"The product does everything it says= it retains its stickiness without sticking to things you don't want it to (your clothes, your floor, your furniture) but it's sort of like Post-It notes in that it sticks just BARELY. My son (4.5 yr old) and I have tried to make many shapes including just a simple roll and PlayFoam won't hold its shape. It falls, deflates, and pulls apart to easily. So, the only thing you really CAN do with it is squish and smash it. My son played with it a couple times before moving on to Moon Sand (much to my chagrin because Moon Sand is REALLY messy but he loves it way better than PlayFoam probably for that very reason)!"
2,Instant mess,"I loved the idea of this and bought several packages, including the ones that sparkle. My daughter and I had fun with it at first, however the stuff does NOT hold together. The colors are difficult to keep separate--make that impossible after about a week. Worst is that it picks up every fuzz, hair and whatnot around. Disgusting--had to toss it. Almost better as a lint brush if it held together. I still have one package unopened I was going to give as a gift, but not now. I dont know what it is useful for except wasted money...:("
5,A favourite,"My grandson, who is 21 months old, just loves this DVD. He wants it on all the time! He dances and sings along and makes the sounds of the animals the Wiggles are representing. Also, he is learning about different animals, from the barnyard ones to those that live in distant countries, like Australia."
5,Kids can't stop watching this!,"My boys love this new Wiggles DVD! My oldest son has been a fan of the Wiggles for years, and we thought he was too old for the group now, but he has watched this DVD at least 20 times since we got it last month. He will stop what he is doing when his favorite song on this DVD comes on. The boys love the backgrounds and love the songs. The music is catchy and this is definitely a winner by the Wiggles."
2,I wanted to like it,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. I thought it had many good ideas for inspiring writing and getting the creative process flowing; however, I found none of them novel. I am not only a voracious reader but also avid attender of writing classes and workshops. I earmarked this book at the top of my list because I thought that the reviews were great and the title was clever. I was immediately inspired and excited to get into the book. Once I started the book, I realized that I would have preferred to read a bit more before I stopped to workshop. For me, the exercises became tedious and it was difficult to continue my flow from book to paper. I suppose for the beginning writer who has never taken a workshop, this book may be a great introduction and very helpful. If you have taken many workshops you may find the process cumbersome if not remedial. I was too frustrated to finish the book and am taking another writing workshop class instead."
5,A path into our Scandinavian Heritage,Astrid Lindgren's children are cooperative role models and the village gives us a path into our Scandinavian heritage and it's values.
5,Great Drawknife,"May be the best drawknife for Windsor chairmaking. Takes delicate and controlled thin slices on spindles as well as larger, but still controlled slices on seats. Other drawknives are too thick and heavy for such precision and control. A total joy to use when others are not. What a superb value!!! Needs honing prior to use."
2,not what I expected!!,"I was dissapointed with this Karoake CD. First off, it does not have the graphics for a karoake machine. It does come with the words in the case. And most of the songs someone is singing the beginning of each verse. I personally didn't like that!!I think they should have gave more information about the cd, atleast to let us know that there are no graphics!Oh WEll!! Better luck next time I guess!"
5,great book,"I ordered this book for my Kindergarten class. My kids loved this, as well as all the other Tacky books!"
3,"few facts, lots of gloomy moods, no insights","The author dislikes everything he sees in the countryside. To him France is basicly ugly, the people basicly retarded. Just when it becomes interesting the author changes the subject. No real descriptions of what he sees, only what he feels. WW I trivia loosely distributed throughout the book. The author has seemingly never laughed in his life. Not even 80 years after the war. This book is not a book about WW I, it is about a man in self therapy."
1,Misguided Hiker,"At least on the book jacket the publishers had the accuracy of noting that the author is a pacifist. His leftist arrogance is astounding, with his condescending views of those who are interested in history (geeks). His sneering little commentaries, including that regarding United States Veterans objections to the apologetic Smithsonean exhibit on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, demonstrate a typically adolescent and shallow-minded view of actual historical facts. I'm sure he his anti-military colleagues are quite thrilled with this volume. He needs to grow up, leave behind his 1960's emotionally-laden logic, and examine actual facts. And because you had a couple of great uncles who made a great sacrifice during the Great War, does not place you in any sort of elevated position in which to judge the military with 20-20 hindsight. I'm glad he found a reason to justify his hiking trip."
1,A maudlin ant-war editorial.,"Mr. O'Shea starts with a wonderful concept - to walk the line of trenches from WWI and describe their location, history and present condition. Unfortunately, the book quickly degenerates into an ever-lengthening editorial against war and history's war leaders. With the clear view of hindsight - which he spends a page justifying - the author judges the generals of 1916 by the standards and knowledge of 1996. His pontificating becomes boring.Unforgivably, he also expresses his contempt and disdain for the amateur historians who purchase his book and line his pockets. Fortunately, this is partly compensated for by the inclusion of a list of references that far better meet the needs of the reader."
1,"A great subject but no sense of time, place or history",The other two negative reviews have hit the nail perfectly on the head. Read them!And then read John Keegan's First World War. There's more depth and understanding in any ten pages of Keegan's book than in all of O'Shea's.
4,a light hearted romp throug the fruitlessness and cost of wa,"an interesting insight from the advantage of time and defines the cost and obserdity of war, especially this war to end all wars. Some personal family conections/losses make this a search through time to connect with family lost in the war."
5,Very Thoughtful,"Like historians Denis Winter, John Laffin, and others sensitive to the Great War experience of the Commonwealth, this author is unashamedly anti-war. He doesn't claim to be a historian but he is indeed insightful. Wasted lives haunt this book and the author honors the sacrificed well. His is a thoughtful, introspective journey that is a tribute to the fallen. The truth he discovers is sincere and quite personal. It is also of great value and deserves consideration. First World War Assoc. Recommended Book and Western Front Award Honoree for History Reflections."
4,Great if you can't afford to pay for a class everyday,"This is a good collection for beginner to intermediate students. He starts off fairly easy, and throws in some more challenging poses toward the end of discs 2 and 3. It's cool to get the experience of a John Friend workshop without shelling out the couple hundred bucks to see him in person. He occasionally addresses the home viewer, which is nice, too, and the musical jams at the end of each disc are wonderful.Although it's no substitute for attending a class in person, it's great if you either don't have an Anusara class near you or just can't afford to take one as often as you'd like."
3,A Card Shark I'm Not:,"This table top sets the mood for our card games. The cup holders are decent and can hold a stem wine glass. The compact size when folded makes for easy storage. The table is a little heavy for a lady to carry, and the carry case is a bit flimsy (ours already ripped). The center seam requires some flattening and adjusting each time we open the table top and the felt has to be tucked in at the seam. We don't play cards often, but when we do, our friends love the table top!"
5,Nice little book,"This is a great little book! I have only perused through it so far, but I cannot wait to sit down and read the whole thing."
3,NOT FOR LAST MINUTE STUDIERS,Great hints and explanations of what they're looking for in the questions. Good ideas to help you eliminate wrong answers to deduce the answers. Use this book to supplement others that provide more test samples with rational. Good Luck!
4,Just Gotta Love Dez and Jay...,"This is a wonderful third installment in Lake's Gun series. It was easy to fall in love with Dez and Jay in the first two books, and that is only enhanced by their fears for each other in number three. Hoping to enjoy a leisurely vacation, they go camping with friends. Their fun is interrupted by escaped convicts, Russians, bad weather, and near misses. The majority of the book takes place over about 24 hours and this reader's legs had sympathy pains for Dez as she ran non-stop to find Jay.Typical of Lake's other books, this one was very well written and drew me in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insead of 5 is I prefer books that lean more on the romance than the action. If you like action, this book's for you. If you prefer romance, you'll probably like the first two books much better."
3,Stupid but it can be watched if no melting ice is available,The fact that there is no way her place of buisness would ever get the ok from any decent health agency not withstanding....the lady has no idea what so ever how to operate her tools nor how to be a mortician. ( No spoilers here at all).It's good low budget stuff which you really dont wanna watch if you have a large block of ice to watch.In fact I listened to the last 20 minutes while I was actually surfing the web ...The plot and script are rather ok ...it's just that you've most definately seen this before.....many times before.
5,This book is awesome.,"Miss Tizzy is an excellent book to cuddle up with or read aloud. This book is a must for teachers. It teachs the days of the week, sequencing, math skills, diversity and true friendship. If I could have only one childrens book, this would be it!"
5,And the children loved it....,"Last Friday I had the pleasure of hearing this lovely book read to a classroom of second graders at Emery Elementary School in Washington, DC. The children were thrilled by the book's beautiful illustrations and uplifting message. They especially enjoyed joining in reciting the refrain, ""And the children loved it."" I highly recommend ""Miss Tizzy,"" to anyone who wants a fun and inspiring book for children."
3,"More fun to flip through than actually use as a ""How to""","I'm always a little disappointed by any book that says it has it all, and the craft and recipe offerings in this book are either overly complicated or very well-worn. We've all seen painted pumpkins, graveyard pudding, and knitted pumpkin skullcaps many times before.What I do like about the book is the holiday stories and lore sprinkled in throughout the book, the list of ""last minute costume ideas"", and photos of vintage Halloween collectibles. The book is fun to flip through, but there's nothing much new I'd use here for decorating or party throwing."
2,Difficult resource,"There is some valuable information presented in this book, but plan on spending at least half your time extracting it. It many compliment your other CF resources.If this were the only CF resource available, I'm sure there would not be many developers thriving today. Even if you're a Dummy, look around for something else."
2,Making a complicated subject complicated,"The problem is, ColdFusion is NOT for dummies. I usually fault ""Dummies"" books for taking too much time explaining elementary concepts and not enough time on more complex topics. Not here. Right from page 1 the reader is dumped into a confusing set of new terms and concepts, with little in the way of examples. Billed as ""Your easy guide to developing interactive Web pages"", the text never mentions that there are a lot of much easier-to-use products for ""developing interactive Web pages"" -- ColdFusion's forte is large, complex, high-end database applications that no ""dummy"" is ever going to build. Anyone who picks this up as a quick way to increase their Web page interactivity will be sorely disappointed."
1,be careful...,"This procuct is clearly labled under the sdram section of memory, but its ddr. dude never bothered to specify that. this is DDR, not SDRAM! I know the picture looks like SDRAM, with two notches, but i just got mine in the mail, and its DDR, with only one notch."
1,Uninformative,"I love reading books about New Jersey, especially the ghosts of New Jersey. This book not only failed to mention some of the most famous ghosts (and minimized even the Jersey Devil!!) but it included some information that was outright wrong. It also included stories that aren't even about ghosts, some aren't even about New Jersey!! The most irritating aspect of this book, however, is that it is essentially a summary of other books - it even mentions which book it gets each story from. This author needs to write her own book and stop stealing stories from other authors."
2,Tori & Dean Season 2,I was very disappointed to find a technical malfunction when I reached the last epiosode on the second disc. About 3 minutes of footage is repeated directly after being shown and in turn approx 3 mins of footage is missing from the episode leaving a hole in the plot. At first I thought I had accidentally hit the rewind button but sure enough it's a manufacturing error.
1,deceptive packaging,ecoPure 5-Ounce Herbal Ear Care is deceptive advertising. I thought I was getting a 5 ounce bottle for $5.99. It is only 1/2 ounce (.5). For that reason alone I would not do business with this company again.
3,good,I have never been a fan of Newton but I got the DVD to learn more about him. Interesting but not great. I have seen other DVD on other famous photographers much more interesting and done better
2,Not very good book.,Very strange techniques and definitely not very practical if you are actually trying to work on someone. I am a massage therapist and a lot of these techniques are just to weird and clients would not be comfortable in many of the positions. Not recommended!
3,Good book - The set of videos is the best,The book is a good introduction but the video set of 7 DVDs is the way to go. The videos are worth the investment.
2,You get what you pay for,"Its does sound good, 3 DVDs for the price of 1, but they are only 50 minutes long each, and none of them have a really good match on them, there all barely above average. But I suppose this is understandable as they were rookies and all. Get it if you really really like the specified wrestlers (Foley, jarrett and Austin) otherwise I wouldn't bother."
3,Wrestling Nostalgia,"I picked up this DVD 3-pack because of it's cheap retail price and my desire to see something a little more old school and non-WWF style. Well, I found it here. The style and pacing of some of these matches is sometimes hard to watch because they can slow to a snail's pace and the movesets are very rudimentary. I think I saw more wristlocks in the first five minutes of the Austin DVD than I've seen in the last 5 years of WWF, WCW, and ECW combined. However, for die-hard wrestling fans this is kind of a fun watch, if only to see how some of today's greats looked when they began. The special features are as weak as you'll find, but what more can you expect for a 3-pack... All in all, I'd say this is a good buy for people who just can't get enough wrestling, but if you really only like today's high impact sports-entertainment style, save your [money] and pick up a WWF or ECW DVD."
3,Too much concentrated on our solar system...,"I bought this book thinking I'll find a lot of explanations about galaxies, black holes, supernovae and other galactic structures, but I was a little bit disappointed to find too much stuff about Mars or Venus and little about galaxies. The title should have been: Our solar system, and other stars...I have found the book I was looking for since then. It is ""One Universe: At home in the cosmos"" by Neil De Grasse Tyson et al.. This book is superb, full of explanations, color pictures and diagrams explaining the physics behind major structures of our universe.If you want more about our Solar System, ""The Universe Revealed"" is good, otherwise if you are more interested in universe and galaxies, I would recommend ""One Universe""."
1,Leary's best days are behind him,I'm soooo glad i have the prime membership. It cost me nothing to flip thru this horrible performance. Simply pathetic. You know you it gonna suck when the primary actor must rely on a monitor. Reminds me of an elected official that was recently re-elected.Amazon should allow negative stars.
4,Tastes very good,"If you like a thin crust pizza, these will work for you! They hold the toppings well, and taste great. I tried (and failed) many times to make my own pizza crust. This is worth the price, if you must have pizza. I froze the other pizza shells, and they always turn out great. (Just sit out & thaw for about 30 mins before adding topping & cooking.)"
3,The London Merchant,The product was okay. The cover of the book is different from the actual book. The photo displayed is incorrect.
4,Succinct and Direct,"An excellent introduction to writing in sequences. Includes breakdowns of a number of films into sequences, as well as a discussion of the four essential considerations for any script: dramatic tension, dramatic irony, dangling causes and telegraphing."
5,Teaching with video,This video lends itself to wonderful teaching ideas. The ease of downloading and saving your own video library on Amazon is unbelievable. I would definitely recommend this product and Amazon's services to all teachers!
2,The color of the Grinch was very wrong,"Like many of the reviews here, I also found the Grinch to be a dirty yellow. I returned this bought the DVD with just the Grinch story at target. That was much better quality with clear colors and a sharp picture. And, the Grinch was the perfect shade of green!"
1,The Grinch is Yellow in this Release!,"I love the Grinch. The cartoon itself rates an unqualified 5 stars. I've watched it every year since it first came out. That is why, when I noticed this ""digitally enhanced"" version, I rushed to buy it. I am, however, very unhappy with this release and have rated the release only 1 star. The Grinch is mustard yellow not green and numerous and intrusive sound effects have been added to ""enhance"" what does not need enhancing. Furthermore, when Karloff is speaking the Grinch's lines, he sound far away. I am writing to Warner to tell them how disappointed I am. Let the buyer beware this one!"
2,Love the movie but...,"Since I live overseas I can no longer access it, so it was a waste of money for me! The quality itself was fine."
5,All's Right in Whoville say You,"Dr. Seuss' Grinch was an indispensable part of my VCR library and when I decided to upgrade to DVD, this holiday classic has become an even more treasured addition. New features that include ""Horton Hears a Who"" and Phil Hartman narrating the making of the Grinch, are surely welcome bells and whistles. But the real reason to own this one is for the heartwarming story of the Green crotchety Grinch and the otherworldy town of Whoville and it's Sea Monkey inhabitants. Told in playful rhyme and with a postmodern wink (my favorite moment is the Grinch's heart growing so much that it breaks the delicate xray frame), this classic will no doubt endure to your children's children."
1,Nauseating,"I had hoped this was not going to be yet another nauseating, sing in a strangled and nasal voice example of english folk songs.Well so much for hope.This album is a waste of space unless you happen to like folk music that sounds like a dirge and is sung in the approved ""style"".what is particularly galling is that I served on arctic trawlers and I swear that the guys I worked with could sing better than this crowd and, at least the crew sounded like they were enjoying the singing.Skip this."
4,Good,"Enjoyed it. Nice to see Billy with a snearing image is--like Keith Richards--actually a polite genleman when you hear him talk. He tells good anecdotes, and the music is good. I even prefer this version of SWEET SIXTEEN."
5,Really a true Idol,"I got intruduced to Billy Idol when I saw this on Vh1, and have never been more impresed by a songwriter in my life. The way he can proyect what he was thinking into such amazing songs. And to belive that I would love ""Dancing with nyself"" 30 years after it was released... it's amazing."
4,Beautiful and unusual umbrella,"I love the style of this umbrella. The extra ribs make it very eye-catching and unusual. The flowers are partially printed and partially embroidered. I bought the khaki one with the orange flowers, but now I wish I had bought the orange one to make it even more interesting."
5,Aris on fluid dynamics,This book is simply magnificent. ANYONE interested in fluid dynamics should own it!
2,Overrated,"Before I've read this book, I've read reviews where it claims that this resembles a ""classical"" read, and it's ""right up there with the Victorians"" in terms of women having no voice. Well, when I finally sat down and read it, I thought those reviews were overrated in its praise. The only ressemblance of the ""women having no voice"" bit was the author not using her name on the cover. The book follows the 'mass literature Harlequin' formula and I thought the main character was a little bland in terms of her ""wanting more"". It is also not feminist of the main character to run off in her life; it was more cowardice in her part."
2,"Could have been so good, but...","I, like many others, bought this book partly due to the hype surrounding it. I was very let down. Although the author captures the breadth of what can be hidden in the average housewife's heart and mind, she tried too hard to be shocking and ""taboo"", thereby discounting the truths that were touched upon. Having a husband who is a robot in bed naturally leads to... cab driver orgies? Note to the ""bride"": Freedom and self expression do not die when you get married unless you let them. Also, investing in a vibrator would have been a wise first move before jumping head on into the whole virgin/sex slave dynamic."
1,Do you have money to waste?,"I bought this because I was excited to learn Nippongo, but this really didn't help me at all. The material is outdated and many people don't even use the phrases that are used here. I have showed this to many of my Japanese friends and they tell me that I should not try to learn from this material."
1,This is NOT the Feast from Project Greenlight.,"Just a warning, this isn't the ""Feast"" from ""Project Greenlight"" even though I found it listed under ""Project Greenlight""."
2,Sell out trendy mass produced mainstream garbage,"This disk is a disappointment. Most of us who have been around in the scene for what feels like forever have come to expect a certain level of perfection from some of the more distinguished artists in this arena. THIS cd however was obviously mass produced for the ""sheep masses"" of candy ravers who have no idea what their listening to and probably dont care as long as their glosticks havent fizzled out. Buy this CD if you have absolutley no idea what your doing in the realm of dance music. After all, ignorance is bliss. Jef"

4,"Nice looking, but.....",The styling on this watch is very nice. The silver and the grey colors look really good. The lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right. Now for what I don't like about it...first after purchasing online I took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out...I'm out $15 for that. The the clasp pin has broken twice another $20 for repair. And the watch is LOUD. When I'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet I can hear the ticking....I don't guess that should bother me..but it does.
3,It`s ok,It keeps perfect time but the band is a tad too small for my wrist. Those seeking watches for large wrists would do well to get expansion band types as these snap types run small.
1,"A pretty face, but it doesn't hold up","I've had this for a year and a half. I wish it had been a better watch -- I wasted $70.It's a very attractive watch. BUT -- the clasp is useless. I had to adjust it several times in order to keep it clamped shut, and now the little holding-tab is so soft that I can move it with my thumbnail.Also, the ""super hardened mineral crystal"" (that's what it says on the case) is all scratched up.Skagen has a limited lifetime warranty on its watches -- but it doesn't cover the strap or the crystal.What good is a watch that you can't wear? One star, and that's being generous."
5,Awsome watch!,"I purchased this watch in 2002. Ten years later I'm still wearing it, and have done so for everyday since purchase. It still looks great and keeps the best time of any timepiece I've ever owned. It's a classic look that will stay fashionable for years to come. It is super-light, and after all this time I have never had to replace the band. You cannot buy a better watch for the value and appeal of this product. Buy. it. now."
4,Price Jump!!,"Wow! I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50. It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95. The links are truly a bear to remove. I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links. You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band."
1,What the?!?!?!?!?,"I thought I was ordering the Disney classic as this was the only movie that appeared for ""Treasure Island."" I am not sure what this Russian rip off is exactly but from the few minutes I watched, I felt like the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 were there with me laughing at what a horrible movie this is. I am in the progress of trying to return it because it is so bad. Where be my Disney Classic--lordy lordy this thing ain't right!"
2,Not What I Expected,I read really great reviews on this product and after trying it for a few weeks now I just don't feel I got the results others were talking about. I'm a guy with curly hair and want my hair to look and feel soft and natural looking. I just don't feel like it was a very moisturizing shampoo. I was using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner for over a year as well as the Moroccan oil curl cream.... I'm going back to using my Moroccan Oil.
3,Not the same quality,"I have worn this product for years, but even though it still smells fairly good, it doesn't have the same quality aroma as it did before and fades away much faster..."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz ...,"Three of my favourite authors strongly recommend this book on the back cover, and so I brought it for a plane flight from Australia to England in order to kill a few hours. It worked, but only because the book sent me to sleep. Bad for three reasons. Firstly, it's ridiculously overwritten, with massive tangled descriptive passages that give no sense of place and induce headaches in the reader. Secondly, none of the characters were at all interesting, and I couldn't give a damn about what happened to any of them. Thirdly, Norfolk keeps showing off his historical knowledge, rather than weaving it smoothly into the text like, for instance, Barry Unsworth. Unreadable."
2,impossible to understand,"I've read all the raves and I beg to differ. I couldn't figure out what this book was about. The characters were wooden and I didn't care about them. The portrait of the period, while unappealing, was convincing but this alone was not enough to make me read on. In the end, i quit."
2,Unbelievable,"I found this story to be over the top and extremely hard to get through. I wanted to put it down multiple times but have trouble not finishing a book. The book has little plot from beginning to end. Each chapter builds on insanity and often hard to beleive 'facts' (a MD parading down the street with balloons tied all over him?) I would not waste your money on this memoir. It has no plot or lessons learned. Augusten I don't doubt your childhood was strange, but take this book to a therapist and spare us."
5,Dysfunctionality at its finest,"Growing up, you often wonder if your family is perhaps the nuttiest in existence. Without a doubt,this book will make all other obscurities pale by comparison. This book will appall you with utter disdain for the callousness of the antagonist, yet torture you with the incessant urge to burst at the seems with laughter. My kudos to the author for having the courage to relive this traumatic experience with such innocence, altruism and unrivaled humor!"
2,Hard to believe,This book was semi-enjoyable. I don't believe most of it. I don't like the way it was written. It was more of a list of crazy things that supposedly happened. The poop scuptures? Come on. I kept waiting to find out who Augusten is & never did. I can't understand how so many people liked this book. I feel it was a waste of time. Sorry.
3,Deeply disturbing and sad,"This is a deeply disturbing and sad story of incredible parental neglect and child sexual abuse. It is also a story of survival. How the author made it through this childhood with any shred of sanity is amazing. This is a very hard story to ""rate"", while not a happy story, it is well written.Probably the strangest thing about this book are all the reviews, both in the book and on this website, that proclaim how ""hilarious"" and ""funny"" this story is. There is nothing funny about this book, at best it is thought provoking with scenes and events that are so strange and weird as to question whether the actions really did occur as depicted. Anyone who compares this book to books by David Sedaris probably did not really read this book.....they just thought ""this guy is gay and he talks about his weird life, must be just like Sedaris."" Trust me, Sedaris's written accounts are humorous, nothing in this book is."
2,"A read you should put down, but can't.","Against better judgment, I kept reading after it became more disturbing with the relations a young Augusten had with a much older and mature Bookman. The humor enlightens a very deep and depressing life that he went through and this story chronicles his life throughout the early teen years. Being pushed off from his mother onto the crazy Finch family, it just keeps getting more unbelievable. From the sexual promiscuity to the love of McNuggets and yard sales turned to living quarters, you can't get more bizarre than this."
4,Dark comedy scores a hit,"I bought this book as I have a habit of getting my hands on books before the movie comes out and ruins it all for everyone. This book accompanied me on a recent vacation to Cuba, and called me back to my hotel room each afternoon to pick back up where I started off. I devoured it in a couple of afternoons. What a wonderful truthful writer Burroughs is! It is reminiscent of Gerald Durrell's laugh a minute, ""My Family and Other Animals"". You never quite feel that you are laughing at them, but more with them. With all the love in the world. Thank you for a wonderful lighthearded, clever, laugh-out-loud, read, Mr Burroughs. I will certainly now enjoy the film, and have ordered all your subsequent books."
2,Not what I had hoped,"Very disappointed with this book, expecially after all they hype I've heard. Nothing but a compilation of events, with a few strings holding the entire story together. There is absolutely no imagery or wit in this book to emotionally magnify or detract from the squalor in which virtually every awful character lives. The author's attempt at wry humor, shock, and sarcasm don't convince me for a minute that this book is clever. Don't waste precious summer time on this read."
1,Disturbing and NOT funny,"Not only was this book not funny, I found it truly disturbing and could not finish it."
2,I've read more interesting billboards.,"I am neither a prude, nor a profligate, but I was disappointed after I received and read this book. Nor, am I a homophobe, in fact I sing in a Gay Men's and Women's Chorus, because they needed my voice and I enjoy their friendship. However, I was not impressed with the graphic description of oral and anal sex between the main character and another male, quite a bit his elder. In many places, this would be considered Statuatory Rape. As a Lesbian friend said, when discussing BrokeBack Mountain, ""Graphic scenes like these give us a bad name.""Anyway, for what ever reason, I feel previous reviews have overrated this book by a great amount. I didn't find any part of it humorous or even enlightening."
3,Funny but very weird...,"I think this book is a little overrated, personally.I enjoyed Augusten's relationship with Nathalie (his crazy 'stepsister')the best. It seemed real and raw. Some of the other relationships seemed a bit fake to me. I know there are some crazy people out there but come on.It does have its moments, though."
3,Running with Scissors . . . and Tripping,"My church book club chose this book because the jacket sounded so intriguing. The running joke over the month to our next meeting was ""Which chapter have you gotten to yet? Just wait!"" The book was a bit graphic and our concensus was that we read it more out of morbid fascination than anything else.This book is definitely not for anyone under 18."
2,"Not a comedy, just a sad tale","Augusten is a great writer, but this is an awful tale of child neglect and abuse. It is amazing he survived to be a successful author. The comparisons to David Sedaris are way off, the only thing they have in common is both being gay. While I was reading the book, I couldn't help but think of James Frey and ""A Million Little Pieces"" and wondered how much of this story was really true, and what was embellished."
3,Mediocre 'Memoir' - Sedaris stands way Higher!!,"Having seen a preview for this book as movie, I decided to read it first. That, and there were numerous comparisons to David Sedaris included in the 'Praiseworthy' section. Not so! The writing is really elementary and it's not particularly funny. Sedaris leaves me laughing out loud (rare!) Mostly I felt sympathy for this person. Do yourself a favor and read all of Sedaris's work before you even consider this mediocre piece. I don't get what the hype is about - average at best."
1,Yuk!,"Reading this book is like walking through a nasty, smelly dump. Yes, dumps are a part of life, but I'd rather not spend time there. It's sad that this is a true story, with emphasis on the anger and bizarre behavior. Spend your time reading something else that isn't as depressing."
4,Good Summer Read,"Though this is certainly not a typical read for me, I found it interesting, horrifying and funny. Burroughs writing style is very lucid yet he manages to keep the reader captive by integrating hilarious stories throughout the book. Good summer read."
3,More bizarre than I expected,"I enjoy memoirs, and thought this might be along the lines of someone like David Sedaris. This book was STRANGE. The movie previews had looked funny, and while this book has some really humorous moments, this man's childhood was one of the saddest I have ever read about. Burroughs is gifted -- he makes you laugh at some incredibly horrible situations -- but this is NOT a light read."
1,Truly disappointed,"This book is an account of extremely disturbing young boy's childhood. I had hoped to find humor in the story and kept waiting, but instead found a sad and somewhat sadistic account of a life that should have had some intervention at an early age.The fact that Augusten Burroughs grows up to be an author and tells this story amazes me. I am not sure I could have lived through this experience and come out the other end with a sense of humor."
1,"Highly disturbing, not all all entertaining","The book cover bills this ""highly entertaining"". Not at all, unless you consider child rape, abuse, neglect, something to laugh about. Would not recommend to anyone, unless you like feeling sick to your stomach."
4,Great Read,"This is a great book, it's a faced paced book, an easy read that you become somewhat addicted to the plot and characters. He's a great writer and his comparisons and images are amazing."
3,A Good Read -- Mostly,"This is a unique book about a very unique life. Parts were hilarious and other parts were sad. Sometimes I didn't quite know what this book was meant to be and lost interest. But usually something happenned that drew me back into the story. I felt that some editing was needed to remove some unnecessary parts of the story. I think it will probably make an excellent movie, however."
1,Disturbing is an understatement,"I eagerly dove into this book, as I've heard great things about it from reviews and friends. However, this is one of the few books that I wish I could have a time machine to make myself never read this book. While the writing style was initially interesting, the book's contents soon took a nose dive to bizarre-ville. The brash, disgusting characters of the book make me wonder whether they were exaggerated or not. I found little humor in the blatant abusive childhood the author grew up in. Unlike ANGELA'S ASHES, which was depressing, yet humorous, this book is just depressing. The lack of humor I was promised by the back cover made it difficult for me to read the author's story of abandonment, rape, and neglect."
2,Flat-Out Obscene,"I bought this book at Super Walmart. I remember the day when that store wouldn't sell certain CDs because of their language and content -- good old Sam Walton was a principled man. Well, Sam's gone and WalMart's principles have slipped. This book is flat-out obscene. Pornographic. It's not some whimsical, quirky story of an American childhood. Parents, be warned. This is NOT a book even for teens, in my opinion. WOW."
1,Content is fine - book in terrible condition.,I ordered a *new* book that was obviously used! There are pen marks in the book and some bizarre crap that's causing pages to stick. Disappointed with whoever is responsible for the book's production.
5,Love it,"It is one of my all time favorites books. Dark, funny, & just wonderful. I'm a very big fan of everything Burroughs does."
1,A Journey No One Should Take,"I always look to memoirs as opportunities to walk in others' shoes and learn from their experiences. After reading this book, not only do I not want to walk (or run) in these shoes again, I want to get rid of them forever. True, the author went through many bad experiences but he was a willing participant in many of his bad experiences. They call this book Dave Petzer with Laughs. I have read all 3 of Dave's books and while they were disturbing, there was at least a payoff. This book is one big self-delusion that I was sorry to be a part of. Don't make the same mistake."
2,Questionable...,"I did not enjoy this book. If it is true it is incredibly heartbreaking and tragic. If it is not, it is overdone and distasteful. Either way it is not funny, and I'd have to question anyone's sense of humor who thought it such. I enjoyed his book Dry much more."
5,Believe it or not...it's True!,"I never knew of Augusten Burroughs until once long ago I saw a very brief mention of this book in the New York Times Book Review. The review was brief to say the least referring to this story as a child who is given up by his mother to be raised by her therapist. With only that I picked up the book.Given the review was brief I didn't know what I was getting into. This book had me laughing hysterically and appalled at the same time. An amazing memoir to say the least. The story is so insane that it is hard to believe it is a true story. Burroughs is raised in an insane environment, a crazy, loon of a doctor and his off the wall children. Burroughs experiences at his young age are scarey to say the least. He has his first homosexual relationship and sex life with a grown man, he's fed pills by the Doctor and becomes friends with one of the doctor's daughters...their friendship is hilarious enough. This book is full of hilarious insanity."
1,Disturbing book,How can anyone find this story funny?? If it is true it is incredibly sad. If it is fiction it was awful.I was appalled to see a commercial depicting this has been made into a movie....a comedy????This was a disturbing book. I hope it was fiction because it is so dreadful to think of a child living through this.
2,Ridiculous,"I am giving this book 2 stars because I finished it and because it is easy to read. However, 3/4's of this ""memoir"" is fantasy and fiction. The characters are so extreme and only become more unbelievable as the book progresses. That's the only thing that'll keep your attention.The book is coarse, vulgar and disgusting."
1,Really disappointing,"Nice wordcrafting is about all I can say about this book. In my entire life, I have only put two books down without finishing them. This is one of them! I did not care for the graphic account (smells, sounds and tastes) of a young boy being sodomized (willingly?) for the first time - and on and on and on. Blechh! If this is a purging memoir, then fine, but please, please, please, don't tell me I should like it. I found nothing endearing, uplifting or gratifying in any of the 164 pages I made myself read before deciding I had better things to do with my mind!"
1,"Not ""Hilarious""","One of the worst books I've ever read. I'm sorry I ever bought and read it. It left me feeling sad and depressed. I feel sad if I even think about the ugly lives described in this memoir. When I see a review describing this as ""funny"" or ""hilarious"" I just don't get it. Did we read the same book? What is enjoyable about child rape, parental insanity, or slowly starving a cat to death?I would give this no stars if I could."
2,"I wish him all the peace in the world, but...","...a good writer he is not. The story is outrageous and sad and my hat's off to him for surviving (and, apparently, surviving alcoholism as per his new book), but it's just not well written. You can tell he and his editor thought his writing was witty and perhaps even funny, but it's actually quite forced and self-conscious. As another reviewer said, it reads like a trashy novel. Bummer. For a much better read in a somewhat similar vein, try ""The Liar's Club."""
1,THIS is supposed to be funny?,"This was one of the most perverse, depressing books I have ever read. I had an advanced reader's copy of this book and read it February 2002; I was shocked to see it actually published and in demand. I would not recommend it to anyone sensitive to childhood abuse, suicide or child molestation. To me these are serious issues and are nowhere near the realm of ""hilarious."""
1,One of the worst books I've ever tried to read,"I finally gave up on this mess after multiple tries. I'm sympathetic to the subject and the subject matter, and I was looking forwarding to a moving but humourous read. Boy, what a disappointment. For one thing, the author's copious self-pity mixes poorly with his attempts at humour. For another thing, it's just not a very well-written book; very pedestrian and absolutely no panache. Don't waste your time on this one. (P.S. Amazon, please add a zero to your rating system. My rating of one is waaay too high for this one!)"
1,shallow self-indulgence,"I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the""shrink"" bashers of the world. This ""play for effect"" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me."
2,OK,This is a true story about a boy struggling to grow up in very difficult circumstances. I thought that the writing was well done but the story line means that it is also difficult to read.
2,"Sorry, but Sedaris is EONS above burroughs.","Not just as a writer, but as an interesting person. And he's pretty much a normal person. It's amazing Burroughs is even halfway normal at all. Sedaris' family was eccentric, maybe a little strange. Burroughs' family, extended and real were certifiable, and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. The fact that any of them were running around loose in the world is damn near terrifying. The Finches should have had the authorities called on them not only for promoting statuatory rape, but for living in filth and exposing children to potentially dangerous people and situations. Yes, there's a dark humor throughout the book, but overall, there's more of a sense of disbelief. It's truly a miracle one of them didn't really turn out to be a mass-murderer. Not a feel-good book."
4,His childhood wasn't as bad as they made it out to be.,"I read a review in the Washington post when this came out. It sounded like this was going to be really f-ed up, so I had to get it. I read some of his short stories online and some of those were harsher than anything in this book. This was still a damn good book, but I know people more messed up than he was.In the Post review they mentioned parts cut out 'cause they were too dirty. One was an incident involving his foster siblings and a tampon, whatever that was. He remains really positive through this whole thing, with his Mom going crazy, an old guy sticking it to him and living in a dump. There's no way of knowing if that's the way he really felt at the time or if it's to make him seem more innocent, or if it's to leave his feelings neutral to let us fill in our own.I lent it to my Brother whom I think had it just as bad as this kid and he loved it. Just wait for his book man, I'm telling you."
5,disturbing in a good way?!,an excellent writer with some insane subject matter. I didn't want to believe it was a true story. If you have a sick sense of humor this book is for you!
2,Kind of Funny but Disturbing,"Kind of funny in parts and very twisted throughout. I found the sexual parts a bit of an overshare, detail-wise. Also since, if his experiences were actually true, that part amounts to basically sexual abuse based on the age differences of the parties involved. It's hard to believe there are people so clueless in this world that they would actually raise their children in the manner described in this book. Read it if you are the voyeuristic type who likes a little absurdity thrown in."
2,Just another American cry-baby,"I read this book on a plane. I even nearly finished it. That's because I couldn't throw it out of the window.And me, I couldn't jump either.This is not literature, it's not sexy, witty, exciting or even mildly interesting.I will prove my solidarity with Mr Burroughs and his homemade problems by simply ending my review."
1,I hated it!!!,"I have to say that I absolutely hated this book. I found it to be incredibly disturbing with disgusting descriptions of the various caracters' sexual lives. I am no prude. I really don't care that he talks about his homosexuality, his mother's lesbianism, etc., etc., etc., but I really grew tired of the vivid descriptions of those events that I had to endure. Those descriptions completely ruined the book for me and I ended up actually throwing it in the garbage because I was so disgusted with it. My conscience would not even allow me to trade it at the local used bookstore because I could not in good conscience aid in circulating this book to another reader."
3,sickening,"The sexual stories in this book really sicken me, made me wanna hurl. I like augusten when he's behaving like his own age, that's the part when I smile or have a lil giggles, but I never have that ""laughing out loud"" like what people describes in other reviews. I'm a bit dissapointed, coz I expected this book to be real funny, but it's not. Even a travel book ""holy cow"" is funnier than this humor-categorized memoir."
1,Forgettable,"Augusten Burroughs has an interesting story to tell, but is incapable of telling it interestingly. He is a poor writer and has only his material to work with; if not for the facts of his childhood he wouldn't ever have written a book. His sentences are simplistic, childish, he has no distinct style to speak of at all and his imagination is utterly impoverished. I was taken in by all the hype. It's no wonder he's compared to Sedaris; neither writer has an edge. Reading them both is like shaving with a dull razor."
1,Run away from Running with Scissors,"Disturbing, if true, and even more so if not -- who would make up this stuff? I read lots of different kinds of literature, fiction and non-fiction, and have never had to stop reading a book because it was so disturbing. Such unbelievable tales of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse of a young child...it was more than I could take. The title ""Running with Scissors"" makes it sound like this is somehow amusing or at least someone enjoying living dangerously. I fail to see the amusement. I certainly hope that writing this book was therapeutic for the author. It did nothing for me but cause me to give thanks for what seems more and more like a normal, reasonable childhood experience -- but then, compared to the one in the book, everyone's experience falls in the realm of ""normalcy."""
4,"Not for Everyone, but certainly for me","This book was almost as funny as A Confederacy of Dunces, only much more twisted. Burroughs covers topics as taboo as any, but with grace and a sense of humor. He bravely faces his past and is the ideal of the resilient child. I kept asking myself, ""What would happen if my mother was severely mentally ill?"" ""What would have happened to me if I have been around a pedophile at his age?"" ""Would I have been able to make use of my experience in such a beautiful way?"" Nobody gets the perfect childhood, but Burroughs sings a song of hope on every page."
4,"Falling All Over ""Scissors""","I wouldn't call myself an avid reader per se. Perhaps its simply because there have been very few books that can hold the attention of my ever shifting mind, none the less Running With Scissors kept my attention from page to page making it impossible to put down. I read the book in entirety in a little bit under a day in a half. From the moment that I started reading it I found myself addicted. Turning page after page unable to stop. If you are looking for a profound meaning to be found in the contents of this book you will be reading it in vain. Pure light hearted fun with discriptions that will remind you of what it is like to see life through the eyes of an adolescent child. You will find pure enjoyment, shock and surprise with each chapter you read. It is definately worth your time and money and is a pure joy to read."
3,Good but not great,"I read this book within 24 hours, which shows that I took this book for what it is, an entertaining read that takes a relatively lighthearted approach to some darker subject matter. I've read Sellevision (also by Burroughs) and found Running With Scissors the weaker book of the two. If you're looking to read Burroughs, start with Sellevision."
4,love the cover,"First time i read this book i was going to throw up, i was disgusted. After a few conversations and thinking over the title and lovin the cover i appreciate the book for its sick humour, crazy metaphors, crude life story and the eating of the dog food!"
2,Easy Read but not Enriching,Although you can read this book very quickly and it is disturbing enough to keep you turning the pages when I was finished I was dissappointed. There is not one character that you can root for. Every character has so many problems it is hard to believe that they are all true.
1,"Guess what, it gave me the creeps!","The book started out light and quirky with a lot of potential, but it takes a rather dark turn when Burroughs moves in with his psychiatrist. Disturbing incidents, insanity, crudeness, and graphic sexual encounters ensue. Somewhere among the chaos is the story of how Burroughs starts writing, but it gets hopelessly lost by the more shocking occurrences.While I can appreciate the author's attempt to find the humor in some very bad situations, the book does not read as humorous. I saw it more as a way for Burroughs to gain some closure over a dreadful childhood. Whether or not the book is completely true, and I have my doubts, it is vulgar, over the top and anything but subtle. I'd try to give an age appropriate suggestion for this book, but I'm 24 and I think I lost a little more innocence the day I read this book. Read at your own risk."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,"How on earth can a story about pedophilia, homosexuality and interracial lesbian love affairs be so godforsakenly BORING? I made it to about page 200 before I just flung the book across the room and said ""FORGET IT!"" Badly written and chock-full of stereotypes, it tries too hard to be ""shocking"". Not to mention that the writing ""sounds"" like a ten-year-old, which made it impossible for me to read. You're a child. I get it. You don't have to WRITE like one! RWS is emoporn at its finest - only presented as a comedy as opposed to a tragedy. Why do people love to read about children being molested much, anyway? The fact that our country eats garbage like this up with a spoon is just further proof that America is in serious moral decline - that, and R. Kelly's new album going gold in one week. (And I'm a liberal!)"
2,Just didn't like it.,"I recently read the memoirs The Glass Castle and The Tender Bar. I started reading Running with Scissors with an expectation that the story would be as well-written and moving as the other two books. I was disappointed and put the book down halfway into reading it. It's not bad, but it's not good, either. The characters are somewhat shallow and unattractive. That's not to say that characters must be deep and attractive to enjoy, but these ones were not interesting to me. I also did not find the story very funny. I suppose what gave the story a flat quality was the narrative voice. Not that reflective, or insightful. Reads more like a highschool essay than a great memoir."
2,disappointing,"Hilarious if you enjoy descriptions of whiners whose hobbies include polishing their coins, and find homosexual pedophilia a suitable topic for humorous description. I don't. Recommended to me by someone who also suggested The Corrections (which I enjoyed immensely), this was a long, slow trek through pretentious, disgusting crap. Sorry I paid money for it. Should have borrowed it from the library or simply read something worthwhile instead. To be avoided."
4,"Nice watch, hard to read","I was impressed with the look and feel of this watch, especially it's thinness and lightness. I ended up returning it, however, because its silver hands against a grey face were almost impossible to read in certain light."
2,Didn't Last a Week,"I bought this watch full price from our local department store. It looks nice and is comfortable and sleek on the wrist. I read some of the reviews here and saw people reported the crystal blew out with out any trauma. I thought--they were crazy.Well, I wore mine for 6 days, took it off for the night and while it was resting on the table we heard a ""ping"" and could not believe our eyes...the center of the watch face exploded and little chards of crystal were all over! Had many watches and have never seen anything like this in my life. There is definitely a design flaw with this watch."
2,Skagen,"I bought this watch a few years back. I liked everything about it, except for the SOUND! One other reviewer mentioned this, so I know it's not just me. This watch is loud, it ticks and you can hear it at night... drove me crazy, I used to put it in the closet and close the door, I could hear it 30 ft away from my bed at night. I emailed Skagen about the problem and a customer service rep emailed me back and basically said, ""there's never been a problem, must be you"", when I objected and pushed the issue I got a defensive email back from another Skagen rep basically saying that there has never been a problem with this watch, no defects, it's supposed to work this way. Well...I misplaced the watch about a year ago, and I haven't gone looking for it..."
2,GLASS CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT - DO NOT BUY,Nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after LESS THAN 2 month of use in office environment glass CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT whatsoever. Now I'll have to find out if Skagen's customer service is any good. For $70 watch I certainly expected better quality.After reading other reviews for this models I realized that many other people had the same issue.BOTTOM LINE -AVOID!!!
2,"Looks Great, Doesn't Last","I received this watch in February and the crystal cracked in a major way (with no abuse or accident) in July.I've owned several Skagen watches and been generally satisfied with their performance. However, unlike the other watches of this design that I've owned, this watch has a crystal that bulges outward. I have read other reviews that indicate that the crystal is a weak point in this watch and I completely agree."
5,"Not ""truncated"" versions of the hits--these ARE the hits!","I'm tired of reading about how this compilation sucks because the songs have been ""edited"" or cut off in the middle. That is simply NOT TRUE. When you see a JB tune with ""part one"" after the title, that just means you've got the hit single version. Back in the day JB recorded the long versions solely so he could cull 2-3 minute singles from them. Sometimes the track was split into part one and part two--or the A side of the 45 and the B side (or in the case of ""Make it Funky"" spread over two singles in a part one, part two, part three, and part four). Most often, however, the entire track was NEVER MEANT TO BE RELEASED.This cd comp is a collection of ""hit singles,"" not a dip into the vaults as most JB cds of the past couple of decades have been. Now I'd never give up my cds with the long versions--I love 'em--but it is also cool to have a cd of the Hit 45 versions."
4,*** for longtime fans; ***** for new fans,"A fine package, no doubt, but for those completists like me, Star-Time is the one, even with its' full-length pressings of cuts that work even better as ""Part One"", which this collection very adroitly presents. (Maybe someone read my Amazon reviews where I complain about all the space used up on greatest hits on various offers which should have used for rarities).The sound here is exceptionally fine; the liner notes are worth reading with every audition; song selection is great, as I wrote in the above review title, for the initiates. My good-natured rant *here* is for something that the powers-that-be would have no time for: including on this double-CD post '88 things like ""Break Away"", ""Funk On Ah Roll"", ""Mom and Dad"" (from JB's fourth Christmas album), ""Peace In The World"", ""Kare"" - even things that *made the charts* like ""Move On"", ""Can't Get Any Harder""."
1,Better illustrations please!,In the picture it looks like a spade tip but it isn't. It's a round tip. I now have to grind it into a flat tip because I'm not spending $7 to ship them back. Can you folks not use misleading pictures please?!! And Amazon; How about smaller envelopes to ship these things in? The S&H cost me more than the tips themselves!
2,Disappointment,"I bought this dvd because I like Il Giardino armonico, having seen and enjoyed their Vivaldi concert with Cecilia Bartoli. The music itself is highly enjoyable, but there are problems with the visual aspect of this dvd. We see the group going from place to place while hearing the music, which is rather distracting. On a positive note, kudos to the group and producer for including little known Baroque composers. The final selection shows the group apparently on a beach with colored hair which I found offensive and irrelevant. It is probably preferable to just turn the video part off and enjoy the style in which the musicians play. Overall...caveat emptor!"
4,Oh Well,I ordered the wrong product and they refunded my money but I wanted to exchange the item and wrote a letter to them to that effect. Oh well!
4,Mother in law loves it but..,This is a gorgeous watch. It was a gift for my mother in law. The clasp comes loose and the watch falls off so she doesn't wear it anymore. Too bad the clasp isn't made to work!
5,watch review,This watch is wonderful...gave as a gift she just loved it....I have owned this brand of watch in the past and love mine......will buy more in the future...
5,Great watch at a reasonable price,"Bought this for my wife to replace another ""dying"" watch. She loves it. Style goes well in casual, work, and dressy settings. (Many women's watches lack a second hand ... but she needs one for work.) Watch is easy to adjust for wrist size, and has performed perfectly for the ~1 month she has had it."
5,Excellent watch! I lost one and bought another just like it.,"I had one just like this for a couple of years. Took it off when going through the metal detector at airport and left it in a bin!!! I didn't realize until much too late. So as soon as I got home I ordered one just like it. I really like this watch. It's light, it's pretty, it's easy to read and has a second hand. I rarely need the second hand, but like having one. I also like that I can adjust it to fit very easily.... no need to go to a jewelry store to get that done."
4,Good Intro to Pop Art for Kiddos,"""Wow."" The price on this DVD here is quite high! That either means it's rare or possibly going out of print... However, check your local library. This DVD only runs about a half hour, and mostly made up of cartoons and cliche' humor when it comes to conveying Andy's personality and quirkiness.It's a great intro to getting your kids to think about their own potentials in art."
1,Allegorical history; few solid facts here,"Written in the 1950's, this book displays a remarkable lack of research and fact. Read S.W. Harman's 'Hell on the Border' instead. The book reflects more about the time it was written than the the person it is describing."
4,whether its really helping or not,This is OK - but I have to admit I'm having a hard time determining whether its really helping or not. I'd rather not have to take any supplements three times a day - so if I buy this kind again I will try to find one with a single dose.
4,Comfortable & Great Looking Heels,"I bought a pair of these shoes about a year ago, and had to buy more! They are great looking pair of shoes, but also pretty comfortable. Just beware...the sizing is a little off. I wear a 7 1/2 in the brown, but a 7 in the black? They are a staple of my work wardrobe, and I love to throw them on with heels too! Just an all around great shoe!"
5,"I love jessicas shoes, the black are my first pair!","I love the shoes they are very beautiful, I recomend them, and give then five stars! and to my surprise they are pretty confortable!"
3,OKAY PRODUCT,ITEM WAS JUST AS LISTED AND SHIPMENT RECEIVED ON SCHEDULE.View tips and guidelines | 6 more words required. .
2,Walken Best Thing In Ridiculous Film,"Christopher Walken is absolutely mesmerizing as Mr. Smith or Mr Jones or whatever they call his shadowy character. His evil swaggering bad man falls in the category of characters you love to hate. Too bad he doesn't have a decent movie to accomadate such an inspired turn. The plot is ludicrous, far fetched, laughable, and just downright silly. Think about it. The murder plot at the center of the film is so far reaching and elaborate. Why is it that they have to pull some poor schmuck off the street(Johnny Depp)and threaten to kill his daughter if he doesn't pull the trigger? Couldn't they just do it themselves and leave nothing to chance? Even Depp seems confused and his performance shows it. The end credits pronounce this as a John Badham movie. I guess calling this piffle a film is too elevated a term."
3,Not a region 1 DVD,"Although I could finally play this DVD in my computer, It was not a region 1 DVD. therefore neither my DVD player nor My blue ray could play. Only by manipuilating my computer siftware could I finally see this classic. Nonetheless, once the region problem and specification was overcomed, the DVD played well."
3,DVD - Nick of Time,I love this movie. It is very exciting. The only thing that keeps me from rating this 4-stars is that approximately ten or more minutes is missing near the very end of the movie.That spoiled it for me.
2,GOOD IDEA WASTED,"A good premise was wasted here. Depp is good as always, Walken too ( altough he's beginning to be repetitive in his roles ). THe beginning of the movie is great, but then it falls apart. GOod to watch without expecting too much from it."
5,The definitive version,"If you saw this on BBC television in the 1960's you will remember the ""Northern Lights"" curtaining effect at the snow queens palace and Kai doing an ice puzzle. (You may not remember the lady inkwell, as I think this may have been cut for television - not essential to the story). The transfer is faultless. Buy it now"
1,not delivered,Kaguyahime - The Moon Princess - Nederlands Dans Theater has yet to be delivered. I have been told to wait until May 10th or so before notifying you. Please do the needful!!Donald Kelman
1,Not Working (Tried 2 Drives) For An Experienced Person,"My opinion of TDK burners are that they are awesome. I bought my own 40x and used it on my Dell. It would not load any type of disc I put into it (all settings/jumpers were correct). I have installed numerous cd drives before, and so I decided to return it and get another 40x burner. Same thing happened (DOA). I upgraded the firmware and software, but no luck still. I returned this second one and got the TDK 48x burner, and it works like a dream! Ran properly from the start. MY ADVICE: Just get the 48x burner and hopefully avoid the bad batch of 40x burners I got."
4,Scarily Fantastic,"These movies are so great. They make you want to wet your pants in some parts from fright and sometimes in laughter. Having them both in a nice case is a great way to display them to the world. Also, make sure you watch them and then go to Universal Studios Hollywood and go through the maze. I wanted to cry the whole way through because the movies made the maze so life like."
4,A Treasure,"I work part-time in a bookstore so every now and then, while shelving books, I will find a sleeper (not one of the best sellers you find on the plexi at the front of the store) that sparks my interest. This is my first novel by Shelby Hearon but not my last. I loved the characters in ELLA IN BLOOM. Ella is lovely. A little lost but very real. In her eyes she has gone through life in second place--the younger daughter falling in love with her older sister's cast-off boyfriend who gave her nothing but an interesting daughter, Birdie. I like how the story works. Hearon is successful at developing the sexual chemistry between Ella and her man (who I won't name here because I don't want to spoil it for you). This novel won't disappoint you."
3,Very Good Bag For The Money,"The bag is a little small for my Sony HD1000, but works fine for the Panasonic DVX, Canon A1, and Sony EX-1 camcorders. The singular side pocket is tight, so batteries, etc. may not fit well, depending on size and quantity of accessories.All and all I recommend this bag for camcorders smaller than 15 /12""."
2,weak connection with Song of Songs,"The book brought up interesting points about relationships and I liked that it called for one to be much more intentional with their dating, especially in a society where dating is viewed as something done for fun and not serious.But I found the book to take a lot of liberties with the interpretation of the book Songs of Songs. It seemed as if the author took the book of the Bible and conformed it to his own viewpoints and opinions."
5,Great Book,"Of Mice and Men was one of the most well written books i have seen. The plot was excellent, I love the friendship between Lennie and George, as well as the foreshadowing with Candy and his dog to the end with Lennie. I feel sorry for Curly's wife. It was just a great sad sad book. I think it's great."
2,Be aware of the warranty!!,The vacuum has good suction but it was refurbished and had some minor problems. I took it to authorized dealer and they said it won't cover by warranty because the warranty time is ALMOST over. Huh? I thought 1 year means 1 year not a week less!!! Yes they denied the repair while the warranty was still valid. That doesn't send a good message about customer service. Be careful about the 1 year warranty when considering buying this product.
2,Great price but item doesn't ship well,Great price for this chalk cone but it arrived with numerous chunks that fell off the top and bottom when we unpackaged it. Clearly doesn't ship well but will still work as needed. Disappointing how much chalk fell off the cone when we unwrapped it.
5,Just what I wanted.,Exact fit for my .15 Fox engine. I would recomend this product to all. Very fast shipment. three more words
4,sean connery as..........007,wow sean connery in a video game how much better could it be his moviesgreat and so is his game. it is the first 007 game that you can have nore controll over your person you can buy weapons clothes and upgradesas shown in the movie.another thing about this game that makes it better than any other 007 game is that there are a bigger selection of weaponsand the aming is great allong with the controller configuration. the only disadvantage to this game is thatyou can not drive as many cars and the levels are some what harder witch i guess that can be a good thing if you like difficult games.so my word to you is if you like the previous 007 games you will like this one.
4,"good book, blank disk",the book is pretty good and goes in depth on the features and functions of the G3. The onl problem is that the disk that comes with it is BLANK. I have emailed the author and had no response so far.
3,Limited research and sources,"The book suffers from limited sources and lack or both detail and explination. It uses the ""he went here and did that on this day"" level of reporting."
4,Good foot lotion,I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. The only reason for the 4 star rating is based on my past experience with this lotion. This time the product didn't seem to slough as much as my previous tube. Could be a fluke or perhaps they changed it. Overall it's a very good foot scrub.
3,Not What I Expected (not that its a bad thing),"This is definitely chillout. However, theres nothing about this album thats electronic. The cd had an urban & jazz club feel to it. The album has a lot of keyboards, light drumbeats and, some piano elements (very loungy). What I didn't like were that some of the tracks sounded too alike and were too mellow and boring to listen even further. In general, its a cd more for relaxation and/or driving through the city to. (don't be expecting any loud or fast-paced beats here)"
5,Fragile State - The Facts And The Dreams,"The Facts and the Dreams is one of those albums that's amazing the first time and every time afterwards. Fragile State's debut has all the hallmarks of a classic -- mellow rhythms, beautiful melodies, easygoing sensibility. ""The Barney Fade"" sounds like a melancholy man, looking back on his life with regret; ""Hoop Dreams"" has bass and flutes and a sublime dreaminess to it; ""Every Day a Story"" integrates an ethnic vocal sample into luminous synths; ""Seraya"" is buoyed by a sunrise-ready piano line. Every track has its own power and beauty. An astounding debut."
2,Shorts,"I expected it to be a bit longer in length, so i just sleep in them instead of hoopin in them."
3,Not what it may seem,"Yes, Old Fidel did write this. No, he didn't sit down at his word processor and bash it out over a quiet weekend. It is a collection of Fidel's speeches, writings and interviews about Che. Some of them are very interesting. Some of them go on and on and on. This bloke can talk! It is hardly an intimate portrait, it doesn't reveal anything new, but it is still a worthwhile read - if only to highlight the relationship between Che and Fidel and the circumstances surrounding Che's disappearance from Cuba."
3,Not sure...,"When I first got my aquarium, I realized that some of the fish were sick, even though I bought this product and tried to use it, the store that sold me the fish provided great advise and products to treat the water. As such I still don't know if this product would have worked had I used the full course.I'm keeping it just in case but I'm also hoping to not have an ick attack again."
1,Art-house wannabe descends into turkeydom,"Wow, what a stinker. Aims for artsy and devolves into a pretentious, silly mess. Fine actors hamming it up with a bad script and poor direction."
2,Not the Best movie,"I never thought I'd see a Brendan Fraser movie I didn't like, well, I was proven wrong by this one. The story didn't come together, the acting was not at it's best, the whole thing just didn't seem right. If you get enjoyment though, from laughing at a movie, this is the one for you. And yes, Brendan Fraser Does look good in this, but other than that, there's not much else going for it."
3,Very Strange,"I liked the movie, in a way, it was extremly strange like nothing ive seen before it shocked me at the role Brendon Frasier plays i never thought he would be a good psycopath but his acting in this film was superb, as was ashley judd's! I found the film strange because there was alot i didnt get about the movie i never understood the concept, or what the shoe meant, over all the movie is about love, anger, and obsession of one man trying to cope with the death of his parents, and not being able to have the love of the woman that he desires, all and all its a great movie i only gave it 3 stars because i was some what dissapointed on a few things in this movie, if you like thought provocing films this is the one for you!"
1,EWWWW,The movie might have been bearable if ashley had shaved her pits!! thats what made this movie scary!!
4,OH MY GOD,"I cannot beleave it took me so long to watch ""The Hot Chick"" its the best movie i have ever seen!! its not just haha funny it's""ha ha HA"" funny!!Its a must watch."
2,Can a question make a story?,"Sure, stylistically this book is intriguing, but that cannot sustain a reader without a strong narrative pull. This book full of internal questions that eventually exhaust a reader does not develop a strong narrative. Nothing changes. I haven't finished the book--halfway--and am compelled to comment here and blow off some frustrations. Yes, the main character is frustrated, depressed, and floundering. So is the story. As a reader, I've been treading water for too long without any narrative goodies to rejuvenate me. Time to get out of the water."
5,A good text book which no physics student should miss it.,"This book is difficult, but if you spend some more time, you will it is very helpful. It will help you to understand the fundamental."
2,Try something else,"As the other reviewer had seen, this thing does not skim very well. Same micro bubbles, same over flowing, same raising out of the water as much as possible. I would set a good height that seemed it would make some good skimmate, to return later to find it overflowing. I did find out that the black knob at the top of the cup is a drain for the cup, but I have not seen if it keeps in skimmate or fixes the problem. The only redeeming quality of this skimmer is that it does come with a small powerhead, so it isn't a total loss."
2,"Tells temperature, wall mount doesn't work","This thermometer comes with a screw to mount it, but the plastic mount that the screw is meant to go into was stuck in the thermometer. When I tried to pull it out with a pair of pliers, it snapped in half. The plastic on this thing is kinda cheap, for for $2, it's hard to complain about it too much."
5,best,"this song is BY FAR the best song i've heard. its great dance music and i love every part of it! i think the original one made by that one guy (in 1988 or something) too plain and slow. if u buy it, listen to the original mix, the extended mix, and the candlelight mix (my favorites)."
3,"Interesting, BUT . . .","This is only readable if one already has some knowledge of Navajo history. The photos are fabulous. The actual text gets more intersting later in the history process, but the first chapter is just impossible unless one is already versed in the history."
2,Dine: A History of the Navajos,"This was a gift for someone else so I haven't actually read the book. I think it was recommended by a Native American source, so that is why I got it. My friend wishes to find out about her Navajo heritage."
4,A great book to accompany a Neti Pot purchase,"I got this book to go along with a Neti pot purchase. It is an easy read, with information as to how a neti pot works, how to use one and descriptions of health benefits from regular use. I purchased a neti pot when I had my last cold, based on some people I know who swear upon the benefits and I'm happy I did. I cleared up my cold within 4 days of using it and now I'm one of those, who testify to it's potential, to help aid in the healing process."
4,UN GRAN TRABAJO,"Este disco muestra la excelente mezcla de sonidos que solo esta banda puede manejar. Un recomendable trabajo que fue un escalon para llegar al excelente ""Miami"" que les recomiendo escuchen."
1,Conviction,I did not like this book the writer did more talking about himself more than the murder so I stopped reading it very disappointing.
3,Mehhh,"I enjoyed Livesy's novel ""Eva Moves the Furniture"", and was therefore hopeful that ""Criminals"" would deliver. While it was fairly engaging, the story was a little dull. I will still try others by this author, but this one was not great."
3,Good,"It didn't help me at all for my Intro to Scientific Computing class (EAS 105) at Penn. I was disappointed, but I'm sure it is useful for other people/classes"
2,Another hackneyed bathroom-bedroom work of schlock.,"The movie started at 4:00. After 1.5 hours I looked at my watch--the time was 4:15. Kingpin is another contribution from our freedom fighters of the 1960's who have successfully convinced most Americans that zooming in on a vomit, flossing food chunks onto a mirror and feigning cunnilingus is downright funny. How absolute the knaves. Bill Murray is the only thing happening in this fiasco, of little their is to see of him. Where are the clever, non-scatological writers in Hollywood? Waiting eagerly for the DVD editing device to create a better movie, I am. Also, enough of the car-riding-and-singing scenes--trite, waste of time and overdone. Two stars for superb DVD transfer. Otherwise, read a book, any book, before seeing this celebration of human juices, goo and excrement."
4,Great Cast-Funny Movie,"A very good comedy, Kingpin, brings to the screen the story of a down-on-his-luck bowler that never quite made it to the top, who teams up with a highly unlikely pair consisting of a young Amish man (!) and a sexy power/money-driven woman, all trying to score big in the unpredictable world of bowling...Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel (who is GORGEOUS!), Bill Murray, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the humor, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Kingpin is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"
4,Reel sleeper,"I past on this in the rental section until an associate found out how much I enjoyed ""There's something about Mary"" and recommended Kingpin. I'm a Bill Murray Fan and now Farrelly brothers fan. A great movie is one that you have to see several times. Great lines in this movie. I use them at work. Bill Murray is at his best. Rivals Rushmore. This movie grows on you. The CD soundtrack is worth its price of admission."
2,Went way past me.,"I am only a physical scientist and not an expert on literature so I am not afraid to say that I found this book entirely unrewarding. I would really like to know where the supposed hilarity was in this book that at least one reviewer referred to.I read this book prior to a trip to Iceland, in part on the great reviews. The irony is that while on the trip I met a woman who read the book based on the same reviews I read and likewise found it immensely disappointing. My son gave it a go and couldn't finish it, saying that it seemed to him like an Icelandic version of Fargo. So if you are not particularly erudite, amused by quirky characters, and drawn in by quasi-surrealism, you might read the Amazon reviews with a bit of skepticism."
2,Not as extensive as other works...,"I first purchased this book under the recommendation that it was a quick reference to most biblical typologies. Although quick, it does lack in content and depth. I'm disappointed that the scriptural references are so few under each entry, and I'm disappointed that some entries are not as extensive as one might think (take ""blood"" for example). Some individuals may see this advantageous however. The brief explanations given are very poignant and refreshing to read because of their simplicity and short length.My core complaint, however, is the lack of scriptural index. With thousands of verses referenced, a scriptural index would be inestimable. On the good side, it is a cheap book, and quite handsome. I recommend it for those beginning a study of biblical typology (because it is easy to follow and simple to read). Another up-side to the book is that it is arranged in alphabetical order.Two stars..."
2,Beware the Shipping and Handling!!!,"I did some comparison shopping and thought this set looked like a great deal. $27 seemed like a fantastic price.At checkout, they wanted $23 for shipping and handling. It seems like they are trying to gouge us at checkout. The REAL price for this set is $50.I passed on ordering the set."
3,Fine for a starter,"They're good for a starter who is just trying to get a lot of chips for a low price. You get better chips for the higher price. Other players won't be impressed, but they won't complain either. Stacks of twenty were not always even and the inside of the case is kind of cheap. That being said, they have a decent feel and will be fine for most home games. Shipping is expensive because they are heavy."
4,Great One!,1. Mutiny on the Bunny (1950)2. Sahara Hare (1955; cameo by Daffy Duck)3. Honey's Money (1962; the only Yosemite Sam cartoon not to feature Bugs Bunny)4. Wild and Woolly Hare (1959)5. Rabbit Every Monday (1951)
4,The Isotope Man...,"In THE ATOMIC MAN, a reporter and his photographer (played by THIS ISLAND EARTH's Faith Demergue!) are out to solve a mystery involving industrial espionage, an imposter, and ""enough plutonium to blow up half of London"". Eeevil men have replaced a nuclear physicist w/ a double. Now, they're going to cause a melt-down at the atomic lab! Meanwhile, the real scientist has survived the assassination attempt, and, in an intriguing twist, has had his brain somehow altered, causing him to be 7.5 seconds ahead of time (as in: he answers questions before they are asked). This is a little-known 50s sci-fi yarn. Definitely worth a look..."
3,A Trashier Grassy Knoll Sound,"I was remiss in following-up on this band, which I regret, but at least the albums are still available. You see, a few years back, I heard ""Driving Nowhere"" on a Nettwerk compilation CD and thought it was one of the coolest things to be committed to disc. Since then, I've accumulated some acid-jazz, disco, fusion, and electronic jazz to better appreciate what is happening on this album.Alas, after hearing the self-titled debut album, this album, Positive, sounds like a trivialization of the welcoming sound previously rendered. It was a good effort, I suppose, but the over-indulgent sampling and electric guitar tended to subvert the improvisational instrumentation. This CD is more demanding of the listener's attention than the debut album, but I think less rewarding. It's no longer your own vision to invent. Perhaps that was the idea, if you're going to read into the conspiracy theory track names."
5,GOD's Words for Dummies,I got this Study Bible for my Grandson who like some of us was having trouble understanding and comprehending the Bible. I checked out quite a few before I purchased this one. I found it to be very simple to understand the commentaries and so did he. If you have this problem then this is definitely the Study Bible for you. Great.
5,Does what it says...,"So far this is as advertised. Sturdy for a paperback. It lives in my backpack, and gets thumped up pretty good. The features are what you would expect, and you can't beat the price."
2,Only 1 out of 3 is good...,"This book has three of Edward Albee's early plays in it. Zoo Story(his first), an amateurish two-man drama, where one is a raving psycho and the other is a man drawn in and then repulsed. That would get only a star. ""Death of Bessie Smith"" is a message play, where racism is just oozing from most characters. It critizes, and it is ugly, but yet..feels so empty. Perhaps it is because Bessie never speaks for herself, only her paramour does pre-accident. Finally, ""The Sandbox"", which is the only good play in the book. It's about death, and our fear of it. Since it is has only one of three good plays, I say, don't bother."
4,And then what?,"Nice and easy, interesting and fun read. A holiday airplane book with a good mystery. Joanna Brady, newly widowed with a young daughter, vows to keep on with upholding the law as it her sheriff husband. She runs for county Sheriff Chief and wins then goes to work right away to solve the murder of an old man accused of molesting his daughter. The daughter, now an adult, has come back to the small desert town to sue the father and take away half of the family's ranch. Nearly everyone, including his other daughter that he had a good relationship with, abandons the old guy. Clumsy at times with family issues not developed well, I still found the characters true to their environs. Not a ""great"" story, but an enjoyable read and would read more of Ms. J A Jance."
5,Not just for biking,"Though these metal clips (I've had them for years) are designed for bike riders, I have found a great use for them when off the bike. I live in the country, and I frequently have to go off into the woods to cut trees or clear brush. Obviously, I've been attacked by more than my share of ticks. But a pair of sturdy jeans and these clips snugly around the ankles keeps the ticks out like nobody's business.A great product!!"
2,Light Version of Sour Cream & Onion,"I really like Kernel Season's products but this is not so good. It has just a light flavor of sour cream and onion; so light that it passes unnoticed. The little flavor it produces is great, but just way too light. I will drop the subscription to this one until they improve the product."
3,Meh,"It isn't anything special... plus it is so powdery and light that it doesn't stick to the popcorn... and I felt like I inhaled more than I actually ate of the stuff, not pleasant to say the least."
1,utterly awful. avoid at all costs,awful awful awful. My eyes and head hurt from trying to watch this offering. Sheer dread. Low budget by choice and feels of an amateur offering. How did this film find distribution and to my video store? again awful and from a horror scifi geek fan. Low the genre of low budget but was bad once again. Cost me a dollar to buy this and could only bear to try to get pass the half hour mark and give the film the benefit of the doubt. Repeatedly disappointed and wish I can get my time and my dollar back. Avoid avoid avoid. Painful and unforfilling.
5,"Wow, it works for me!","I have been trying for 5 years to get a handle on headaches associated with blood sugar or insulin resistance as well as sensitivity to cold air, this worked immediately. My blood sugar numbers always looked good on a glucose meter monitored for 3 years.I would estimate around a 98% improvement. No more headaches! Downside is that I can overeat by snacking now, which I will do my best not to do. Maybe the soil mineral depletion that we hear so much about is true. Commercial farmers don't till the soil anymore, so I am told."
2,Skylarking-2 1/2 stars,"This book was not worth the wait for fans of the Company of Roques. The mystery and romance are slow moving, the conclusion anti-climac. Also unlike the other Roque books the other members of the club are hardly seen and have little to do with solving the mystery.The book is not a total waste since Jo Beverley creates some likeable characters. I enjoyed the philosophical debates between Stephen and Laura. I liked the inclusion of Harry in parts of the novel."
1,Doesn't Deliver the Goods,"This book does not deliver the goods promised in the title. It turns out that one of Glynn's pieces of ""evidence"" is nothing more than the anthropic principle which notes that we live in a very unlikely Universe. Change any one of several fundamental constants of physics, and the Universe could no longer support life. However this reasoning is akin to the winner of a lotto ticket noting that if any of his numbers changed, he'd not be a winner. Hence God must have been behind his winning. Even if you grant the supernatural, the anthropic principle cannot be used to claim that we humans are the intended purpose of the entire creation. This isn't evidence at all. Carl Sagan, tongue in cheek, formulated a ""lithic"" principle because rocks could assume that the entire creation was intended for them."
3,Truth never NEEDS to be ARGUED!,"""He whose existance is more obvious than anything else does not need a proof."" Belief is a matter of feeding both the mind and the spirit, and Glynn's book is an attempt for doing only the former. The ""food"" for the spirit comes by experience, through an inner struggle supported by action. I wish believers of God would not have to present themselves in a defensive manner (as in Glynn's book), but today's society is constantly disillusioned by the supposed victory of science over religion. The response from the religion (in some cases) is to fight back. But, I believe there is no war to fight! For inquisitive minds, I highly recommend the book called ""Questions"" by Gulen, which includes ""science versus religion"" topics as well as many others that should be interesting to people of any religious conviction."
5,Great for first time collectors,I bought this book for my boyfriend who is just starting to collect lighter's. He just loves it. He has it by his side when ever he is looking at one to buy on-line. It has the prices and great photo's.This book has alot of info on Zippo's. Very easy to understand. Plus it keep's him busy! LOL You will enjoy this book.David Poore has done a great job with this book. I've never seen the first addition but we really like this one.
2,Ain't what they used to be..,Big let down. I loved these as a kid- they aren't the same. Dry and sort of tasteless by comparison. Bummer.
4,I've used it every day for four years.,"The price is a bit high considering it is an easy design, but if I remember correctly it is a small business that a woman started on her own, so I don't mind supporting that. I received this before my son was born over four years ago, and since he was born, I've used it every single day. I don't like having a diaper bag with me most of the time; I just stash things into my purse or regular bag. This pouch holds a travel wipes container and a handful of diapers (right now we have five in there). I do wish it was a tiny bit bigger, but again, what I like most is it's ease of use and the fact that it is NOT a big, bulky pouch or container. Sometimes it is the only thing my husband and I have brought out with the kids. We throw it in the car, in the stroller, whatever."
4,My Party Shoes!,"I bought these shoes for my company holiday party, and they were all everyone was talking about. The heels are a little high, so I had to wear them around the house all week to get used to them."
2,Not what I expected,"The cover is more worn than I thought, and the pages have much more highlighting than I expected. I hope the highlighting works to my advantage, but I am not sure that it will..."
1,exposes the greedy nature of Anti- flag,"I owned this album, the explicit version, and as much as I hate cursing and ect and ect... I think its kind of a contradiction that they'd sell an edited (clean) version of this CD. Think about it. They speak out against censorship of the press, yet they have no shame in censoring their own music. Now, I personally don't buy into Anti-Flag's message, so If I had the choice I would probably get this over their explicit version. I meen, hey, ultimately its the music that counts. I just think the band though ,is being kind of shallow in expressing their already shallow opinion."
3,Good,"A lot of people don't think this was a good PPV. It was not the greatest Survivor Series ppv but I thought it was a pretty good PPV. 1992 was a very interesting time in the WWF being that this was the second PPV that did not have a Hogan oriented main event. It was also the first Survivor Series where the whole card was not full of Survivor Series style tag matches. My favorite match of this PPV was ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Henning's comeback match where he teamed with the ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage to face Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. Also included is the Undertaker vs. Kamala in the first televised Casket/Coffin Match, Big Bossman vs. Nailz in a Nightstick Match, World Champ Bret Hart defends against I-C Champ Shawn Michaels, and more."
5,This book will save marriages on the brink!,"Nancy A.'s book on the ""greener grass syndrome"" in marriage is marvelous. In just 121 pages, Nancy not only shares her own gripping tug-of-war experience propelling her to the brink of divorce, but she also provides tools for affair-proofing marriages. The book testifies of God's ability to bring beauty out of ashes in marriage. It also exposes the illusions of extra-marital infatuation and the trap of anticipating/seeking greener pastures. It is a must read for protecting marriages and reversing wheels spinning toward divorce!"
1,Honestly- No In Sync,"One of my favorite movies and the sound is off, not in sync with their speakingl Very dissatisfied. Ordered this product and was very dissappointed."
4,Rare gem of good storytelling,"Understated and well acted, this film focuses on the awkwardness of fading frompu.blic glory, while trying to maintain your dignity. Great character development as we learn more about Tess."
5,Guarding Tess,I am a big of fan of Shirley McLaine and Nicholas Cage. The movie begins and ends with comedy and drama. Nicholas plays a frustrated Secret Service agent to guard a former first lady played by McLaine and she keeps him on the run. The movie is wonderful. I highly recommend it.
