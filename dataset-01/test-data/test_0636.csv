5,All that was said and more,So far it is working out. Lots of room for everything and the best thing it is all in one place.
3,Good Bag But Tends Toward Bottomless Pit,"I really wanted to love this bag because it has a lot to offer, but I was frustrated that the largest compartment did not have more pockets and tended to be a bottomless pit. I was also disappointed that it did not have an insulated pocket for bottles. If you need a large bag for multiple kids or big trips with the family, then this may be a good product for you."
3,Disappointing answering system,"After seeing good reviews for many of the AT&T; phones here ,I bought the E5900B locally. The unit seemed to have good quality build and a great features list. Unfortunately, I am returning it before using many of the features. The sound quality on the answering machine is so poor, nothing else could get me to keep this unit. I couldn't recognize my wife's voice on trial messages. It is overly compressed, like some Battlestar Gallactica robotic voice. It is worse than a 10 yr. old no name unit I had previously. I would rather have had 12 minutes of clear time than 25 minutes of this.The handsets are good, with clear reception on calls. Range seemed acceptable, but not exceptional."
1,Never Received this product from Amazon,Can not really review as I never received from Amazon and had to purchase at full price from college bookstore.Very disappointing service
1,"Down and Dirty, The Plot to Sell a Poor Book","Boring to say the least. Mr Tapper does a good job of copying data from other sources. He is not an author, more of a Cannon Copy Center. He is a ""want-to-be Andy Rooney"" and does a poor job at that. Could do without his one liners and feeble attempt to be funny.The book was about exciting as Gore, and written in a close manner to the way George W speaks. Save your money!"
1,Poor fiction,"The only surprising revelation in this book is that halfway through it Tapper finally finds a kind word for a Republican (something he never does before or after). ...Tapper also conveniently glosses over many important issues, such as the media's Election night biases and some obvious election fraud in Missouri. ...To be fair, he's also harsh toward Gore and a few of his closest advisors. However, his main complaint seems to be that they weren't friendly and genuine-looking enough and thus lost to Bush. It seems more like anger at Gore for losing than anything else, ....If you're a leftist who doesn't mind poor fiction mixed with their propaganda, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a balanced, truthful version, keep looking."
4,"Started strong, finished weak","I love the Avengers and own most of them. I was running out of things to watch so tried the New Avengers 76 and really got into it. I enjoy Purdey and Gambits chemistry on screen. Unfortunately the last few episodes are in Canada - and while at first it was funny and something different, I just didn't enjoy it as much."
5,It's a Winner,What a cute and simple game. The dolls and clothing are made of hard cardboard but very nicely made. Basically the game is very simple. Each player chooses a doll and the the game begins. You spin the spinner and begin to dress your doll. If you spin hat and you have already dressed your doll in a hat you can trade that hat in for another one. There is also a spot where you have to turn in a piece of clothing if you land on it. The first one to dress her doll wins. It is a simple and fun game. EeBoo has another winner !!!
4,Quality and fun,"My kids love this game. I think it is good quality, durable and the artwork is charming. We give it as a gift often and I'm always surprised how big of a hit it is considering it is so simple."
5,The Fourteenth Victim,"this is an excellent documentary detailing Eliot Ness and his hunt for the notorious cleveland torso murderer.previously only available on a hard to find vhs,this has now appeared on Amazon in an updated dvd edition and i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in this fascinating case."
4,Yellow Sun Glasses,I had a little trouble adjusting to the color of the lenses. They are probably the best driving glasses I have ever used. As everyday sunglasses I would go to a dark polarized lense. They do tend to change the color ar anything that has blue coloring in it. Of course that's why they call them blue blockers. I would recomend these glasses to anyone who drives a lot.
5,liked the glasses,We bought these glassed for my husband mostly to use at work. He drives truck and wanted something to cut the glare. He really thinks it helps him alot in all weather.
5,"Great toys, outrageous price","Folks, this is an outrageous price for this product. Other Amazon sellers sell them for much less, and Amazon itself sells them for $16.99 (and it's eligible for free shipping if you have signed up for Amazon Prime).Or, look at other websites. Justkidsstore dot com has 'em for $13.59, and even Target sells them for 26.99.This vendor is just trying to make a killing on this product. For shame."
5,Best overall book on getting started with this techology,"This book covers just about everything you need to consider/understand/learn before getting started with GIS technology. And it's not biased towards any particular vendor, which is good. The book is up-to-date and has been a proven guide over time for many, many people. I know one person who teaches using just this book. When consulting with our local city government about getting started using GIS, the last thing I did was give them a copy of this book. They immediately bought one for every person on the team. This book is good for both management and for the technical staff to really understand what decisions need to be made right from the start. This book will save you a lot of time and money by helping you do it right the first time."
4,Great for a beginner... for the money,I'm had my Privia PX110 for a month now and I'm very happy with it. The weighted keys feel really nice (although they make some noise on the return). The internal speakers and piano sounds are great for my practice sessions. I use the metronome regularly... some other models didn't have this feature.Since I started playing I have played on two acoustic pianos and a couple of different digital pianos. The Privia still seems like a very good buy for my purposes although if I keep playing it regularly and improving I will upgrade to an acoustic.
2,Boring,I thought this book was really stupid and boring. It had too much praying in it. The only thing I learned was not to judge somebody before you get to know them.
1,Dear God,"This is one of the slowest books I've ever read: meandering, go-nowhere, unrealistic situations and STUPID characters. This would've been better as a made-for-TV movie in the 70's."
3,a page turner but not a classic,"I am somewhat miffed over all the 5 star reviews for this work. A classic it ain't. The author propels his story with enough interesting twists and turns to keep the reader engaged, which makes for a decent reading experience, but there are some serious flaws..Some of the story development is beyond believability for me. Most of the characters are thin, and some (Special ED) should probably have been omitted from the story.The style reads to me like a screenplay from the Lifetime channel, a lot of gloss and sentimentality. Writing in the first person, from the viewpoint of a fifteen year old is difficult to pull off intelligently; I labored over some of the direct statements made by Dominic and his peers.All in all, I would recommend this book for someone who wants to be entertained by a quick read. To be enlightened, look elsewhere."
3,Great at the price,The Colby CD player is light and functional. It is definitely worth the money. The LCD screen is way to small and difficult to see. If you need a cheap CD Player this is it.
4,Good cheap cd player,"I picked up one of these for around 10 bucks and I get about 10 bucks worth of cd player. Pretty good value if you just need something to play cds that you can take around with you. The skip protection is mediocre at best, (I can't put it on the treadmill while running for example) but for 10 bucks I can't really expect it to do everything right?"
1,Personal CD Player with 60 Sec. Anti Skip & Stereo Headphones,SUCKED- I ordered it for my Mom on the other side of the Country and it arrived broke. it never worked. She discarded the box so it could not be returned.
4,Good cheap outside light,"For the price it was a steal ($12.00), but it is just an average quality light ($50-70) range. I would rate it higher but the light was not exactly level. I had to bend it to make the part that hangs hang level. Which was not a problem but none the less kept it from 5 stars. I would recommend to anyone in which this light would match their decor."
5,"Well-built, mobile punching bag","I found this to be a solid, well-built bag. It's easy to roll into a corner when not in use. The water-filled base is heavy enough to keep it planted during most kicks and punches. It does move and slide a bit, so circling it while working out is a good idea. My brother and I were using kicks and elbow strikes which knocked it over, then we read the manual states: do not knock it over. Oops! I would not recommend using shoes with sharp treds when kicking, but the material is tough and resiliant. I'm very happy with it. No complaints."
2,Mamas Bad Boy 1992,This is a very different style Master P he is hardcore Gangsta here the quality is bad the raps are not that bad this is yourtypical Gangsta rap album from 1992 but it is not as good.Lyrics 7/10 Production 2/10 X Factor 2/10 Style 8/10 Voice 7/10Music 3/10 Innovative 5/10 Classic 2/10 Guest 6/10 Blends 5/10Overall=47 wich is worthy of 2.5 Mics needed better production
3,Frustrating Text,"I have taken my share of English classes in my journey as a student. The course that I had chosen for the spring/summer term 2008 required this book as our text. I can honestly say that I have never had a book frustrate me as much as this one did. Drew Hinderer, a decent writer should have revised the second edition to this book. Some chapters I felt I could connect with what he was trying to say, others left me puzzled as to why he chose certain examples and whatnot. My main gripe most of all is that I felt as though he was talking down to me. I personally would not give this book a second look. That is why I donated it to my class instructor so that some other student wouldn't waste the thirty dollars that I did."
2,Not for 'Pure Moods' fans,"Not up to the earlier CDs in the series. Very disappointing. There are some decent tracks, but I will not struggle through the very mediocre rest of the CD again to get to them."
4,great!,"a real nice musical change for Pure Moods - better artists than the last one and some great songs, well-known and more obscure. less new-agey. thumbs up"
1,DISSAPOINTED,"Having 2 boys who love guitars, this one looked great and although my 2 year old likes it, it's really poorly made. Yes, he's rough with it, but the strings won't stay tuned and tight no matter what we do. Our 3 year old has the First Act guitar and he too is rough with it, but it holds up amazing. Feel like I through money in the trash by getting this guitar."
1,HORRIBLE CHEAP not worth the money,"This is the cheapest thing ever. It does not stay tuned, the paint chops off, it is a total waste of money. I asked for a refund and the company did not respond."
4,nice presentation,"this product looks like a real guitar (only in miniature) My nephew loves it and the fact that it has it's own case. it looks sturdy and looks enough like daddy's for him to think it's pretty cool! i was hoping it sounded a little better because it looks so real, but it won't seem to hold the tuning. that's ok. it's not like a three-year old is actually going to play something pleasing to the ear anyway, right?"
1,This guitar is CRAP!!,"My son was given this guitar for christmas and when he took it out of the box it was great! He was so excited, he strummed the guitar about 4x and then the handle of the guitar actually just cracked right off, he didn't slam it or anything. He tightened the strings just slightly and that was it, guitar broken. So, the day after christmas I had to go buy him a nice guitar for just $5 more from toysrus and this guitar is working great and providing alot of fun!"
1,Very disappointed!,This item is terrible! The box arrived with mold inside. The guitar is not tunable and sounds awful. I would expect to be able to play a guitar that I paid $40 dollars for. I will be seeking a refund!
1,Item didn't match description,"From the description, I took it that this book was the actual textbook, ""Biology: Dynamics of Life."" However it was the STUDY GUIDE and it's in SPANISH! Neither of these points was in the description. I have to call their customer service number and see if I can send it back."
1,Requires Patience,"I gave it the ""old college try"" and read half way through then just had to give it up. It is no where near the caliber of Steig Larsen's Girl With the Dragon Tatto. It is slow and plodding taking much too long to build a story and I'm not sure what the story was to be. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,O-Ring Seal does not fit when locking,"The product is solid and looks nice but is flawed by a miss-sized O-Ring. The job of the rubber O-Ring is to keep dirt and water out of the locking mechanism. There is a groove for the O-Ring to sit in, however you will notice that this product can not be reassembled without the O-Ring pulling out of the grove and getting caught outside. This of course defeats the use of the O-Ring for sealing.I thought that this may have been a defective item so I returned to Amazon for a replacement. The replacement item had exactly the same issue. I contacted Master Lock by phone regarding the issue. The representative was not helpful telling me that there are no know issues with the product and to exchange it for a new one.I will now send back the replacement lock for a full refund. Good thing for Amazon's return policy!"
4,Does what it suppose to do,"After reading couple of reviews I decided to go with this Master Lock. Yes, after receiving it, I noticed that the O-ring is too big on it and when you go to lock it, the O-ring gets pinned between and bolt and the lock. Simple solution, go to a store and get a smaller O-ring, hence I gave it 4star rating.After making a slight corrections, this locking pin works perfectly with my 2008 Toyota 4Runner and Allen Deluxe 4Bike mount rack.Product looks solid and isn't too big. I think the other Master Lock with red end might be too long for a 2in hitch receiver. This one fits perfectly, glad I got this one and would recommend to others."
2,Not long enough for 2012 tow package.,"This appears to be a good quality lock, but it is not long enough to fit through the receiver of a 2012 tacoma. This could not be determined by the specs listed on Amazon's description. The description says it fits all class III and class IV receiver hitches, which is inaccurate."
5,great product,"easy to insert and with the lock at an angel easy to see to unlock. on top of that, it is a nice looking tool with the blue anodization"
2,Stainless steel body is flawless! Too bad the rest of the lock isnt,"The stainless body of this lock held up very well to the MN winter, however the locking cylinder didn't, it only lasted one winter. I could have bought a cheap chromed one and saved a bunch of money! Waste of money and I had to cut it off anyway!(an angle grinder with a cutting discs works great) Save your money and just but the cheap $6 ones. My lock also was the older ""dog-bone"" style, if that makes a difference."
3,Entertaining walk down memory lane.,"The author describes his experience and observations around famous failures in software industry. The language is very entertaining. His description of MicroPro's dilemma with Word Start and Word Star 2000 'MicroPro wrestled itself to the ground' made me laugh.Author's repeated description of 'I was there', 'I was the first one', 'I still have that floppy' etc. are boring. A bit of foot notes are good, but this book has tons.This is a good book for entertainment. Not a great one if you want to learn something serious."
3,Season 2,"I wasn't much of a Denis Leary fan before watching the Rescue Me series. I really like him in this role. The local video stores carry Season 1 but not Season 2 which is why I bought it. Overall, I enjoyed it. The producers could cut back on some of the racy scenes though. That's just my opinion."
5,Purchase with Amazon,"I am always very skeptical from buying from online sources. I was therefore very pleased and happy to receive a textbook from amazon that was in mint condition and cost me much than I would have payed in a store. The package was delivered soon after placing the order and they didn't lie when they said ""new"" on the ordering page. I would buy again from amazon."
5,My yellow lab loves these treats,"These treats are healthy, they are easy to break up into smaller sizes if necessary for training, and my yellow lab puppy loves them! I definitely feel like my trust placed in the Wellness brand is well-founded because they make such trustworthy products."
2,Not worth $22.00,"Don't spend too much money on this. The video is worth about $6.00. The moral of the story is you start at a high price, then you knock off $4,000 and the buyer gets excited. It's painful to watch poor people agonize over the monthly payments. I liked the main character, you sympathize with him, but not for $22. Just rent it if you want to see it."
3,"Entertaining, but it went nowhere","I was pulled into this tale by the first few pages about Eliza and her adventures in the theater, but the story didn't turn out to be about her. Rather it was about her son, Miles, who decides he's going to build an airplane (in about 1876). The other part of the book is about Isabel, a spoiled rich girl. It takes about 140 out of 198 pages for them to meet, and predictably fall in love. Or maybe fall in love. Miles is totally lacking in emotions and has very little to say for himself. He's hiding the secret of wanting to fly.The other characters in this book are wacky and reasonably interesting. It simply does not go anywhere much. Lots of good details, but no real story.I've read a couple of other male Australian writers, Peter Carey and Tim Winton. Why are they so peculiar? Are there any women Australian writers? Are they weird too?"
4,This cd is breaking my heart!!!!!!,"When I saw this movie the first thing I said was ""Oh my god. I have to get the soundtrack!"" So I went to the cd store next to the theater and I bought it. It was dark out so I couldn't really see the track list. When I got in my car and I started playing it, I loved it!! The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it doesnt have ""Oops I Did It Again"" by Britney Spears. Otherwise this would be perfect! Buy this!"
1,They left out the best song in the movie!!!!!,"When I was a young girl I used to love a song in the movie Little Darlings: ""Oh My Love"". It sounded like John Lennon. But when I got older I bought Double Fantasy and His Greatest Hits,and there was no ""Oh My Love"". Then a couple of months ago I was watchinh Heartbreakers(I hated it) and ""Oh My Love"" went on and my heart leaped...I could finally buy this beautiful song. So I go on here lookin for the Heartbreakers soundtrack and lo and behold,some of you Reviewers are tellin me it aint on there! What were they thinkin???? That songs the only redeeming factor of the movie. sigh. Guess I'll have to look for ""Imagine"""
4,missing song,"there was a song that I loved but it isn't on the soundtrack. It's played where the main characters are on a speed boat looking at all the neighbors. The song sounded like it was by Beck but it's not. Someone help, it's killing me!"
2,Please email me,"Leaving JOHN LENNON out is horrible--and I have another question--there was a song I recognized with a Brazil flavor--when Weaver and Gene were on the couch later in the movie (soon before he dies),and it a lovely song--and it is just not there. These soundtracks are often a rip-off because I often get more excited about the soundtrack than the movie--does anyone remember the song I am talking about? THANKS!"
4,Interesting and funny!,"I enjoyed this novel from beginng to end. Although the main character has reality problems and mental illness, he slugs through delusions to find an answer to questions that baffle the police and other zanies. It is fun to read, but I would caution anyone who is a professional in Psychiatry or therapy ddto find the link to reality.SO I guess that leaves the rest of us! The interested readers to figure out if it is a good read! I recommend this book."
2,Decent Spaghetti Western,If you are buying this as a Bud Spencer fan skip it. Bud's voice is dubbed in a voice higher than his which might bother you. The story is about a man kiowa(Ford) who's framed for robbery and his wife killed. After 5 years in jail he's released he than hires Bud and some others to help him catch and kill the guy. A decent western but thats it.
4,Gargoyles,"Take a look at what could happen if we're not careful. Would a research company in the medical field stoop to this level? A lesson in being careful for world.Premed student Amoreena Daniels needed money desperately. Her mother was ill and without hospitalization. So Amoreena accepted a timely offer.Being a surrogate mother shouldn't interfere with her plans or studies, should it? Nine months to produce a healthy baby for adoption and money to pay for her mother's care--it seemed so simple.It was--until Amoreena began to notice how some of the other patients of the clinic were acting. And why were there so many armed guards? She found she wasn't the only one asking questions.An exciting read to hold your attention. A look into human nature and its dark side. Highly recommended as a fun read that will set you to thinking. Talented author Alan Nayes offers a well-researched, realistic look into the lives of people who live this story. You won't soon forget them. Enjoy. I sure did."
2,The Author Who Didn't Try,"I've read and loved other works by William Sleator as a kid. I'm now 25 and have recently reread ""Singularity,"" which was significantly better than this book.On the positive side, the basic plot was interesting. It does a good job of explaining voodoo black magic and exploring what could happen if a teen got involved with it.Unfortunately, the actions of the characters aren't believable and most of the conversations are strained. It seemed like the author didn't take any time to research how teenagers would have talked or acted in the given situations. The ending was abrupt; I felt like there was one more chapter that didn't get written. Overall, it just felt like there wasn't much effort put into it.If you'd like to read a book by William Sleator about dark magic, I would suggest you pick up ""Blackbriar"" rather than ""The Boy Who Couldn't Die."""
1,Most stupid book ever,"I can't believe how many positive ratings this stupid book got. I haven't read such crap in a while. The whole story is lame and makes no sense, the guy is an annoying brat and the plot speed is ridiculous. The most insane things happen, and on the other page, it's already about some other thing. The way people deal with supernatural things in this book is plain ridiculous and laughable. There are no real surprises, the end is lame. I can't recommend it at all."
3,Runs Small,"This costume is adorable, but it does run small. I purchased for my 4yr old daughter to use for her PreK4 play, since she was a Sunflower, but it didn't fit. I ended up ordering a differnt one in larger size that was more expensive and I wasn't happy since really it was for a one time use event."
2,Mac users beware,"One of the reasons that I was so interested in this particular book for MAT review is that it came with a CD-ROM of pracitce tests. However, what was not clear before ordering was that the CD-ROM is not compatible with Mac computers and will not work. If you use a Mac, the CD is useless to you, so keep that in mind. I was really disappoined."
5,Thank God Season 2 is coming,"I am really happy that Season 2 is coming, as I thought it might not come due to insufficient demand suggested on this web site.I really like ""The Nanny"" as I was growing up with her.I was learning English with this sitcom when I first migrated to an English speaking country because English is not my first English. She made me laugh, made me cry during my early days in a strange country and I really want to recap these precious memories by watching the show on DVD again.Though there are no such ""extra"" stuff on the DVD, but I am already too grateful for it to be released. Those memories of mine are very very precious to keep.Last but not all, as I want to watch this show with my other friends whose first language is not English, I really hope that this season two will have English Subtitle, instead of just Spanish or French, etc.Thank you Nanny for growing up with me. :)"
4,love it,Not really much to say other than I watch many of the episodes on cable. I just wanted to have the DVD on hand just in case I wanted to watch a certain show.
3,Okay read but not as good as I expected.,"On my quest to find good laugh-out-loud humor, this book fell short. It was good enough that I read it but not one I would read again. Perhaps a little too tame for me. But I could relate to a few sections. An okay way to pass some time."
4,Thomas' Songs & Roundhouse Rhythms,This CD was purchased for an almost 4 yr. old Thomas fan. What a hit!
4,absorbing,"if your idea of a mystery is a gory police procedural or a gritty cynical big city private eye caper, this book is not for you.this comes close to a traditional british cozy, in that it's more about character than forensics and more small town than big city. the plot is extremely well presented, the characters are well drawn, the dialogue is enjoyable, and there's a cat. and there is also a lot of humor, from laugh out loud to small smile of enjoyment, from almost slapstick to irony.there is a feeling of realism in all these elements. the events and situations that propel our heroine into sleuthing are believable and logical.i have read and enjoyed the author's _sunrise_ as well as this novel, and look forward to reading more. it's a great pity she isn't better known."
2,"JUDGING BY THE LACK OF REVIEWS, I AM NOT ALONE!","I will always encourage the efforts of any african american writer or artist trying to make a mark, and I encourage us to support one another. However, to be honest, this book and ""Sunrise"" were not for me. In a mystery, I look for more plot intrigue, sharp dialoge,and characters that I either love or hate, but with passion. I did't find any of this in either novel. But to her credit, if you like small town mysteries and more scenery than excitement, she is a master of description."
1,Great item but not for $75,"These are really useful for saltwater anglers who use wire leaders. However you can buy them at the big box fishing stores for $15!Either this price is a mistake or a total ripoff.5 stars for the product, 1 star for the price."
5,Hard to find - perfect,"This was perfect! I had the square charms for my three older sons and was looking all over for a charm to match for my fourth son. I had the hardest time finding an exact match, but this was perfect. Thanks!"
1,Words cut off,"The book looked like a very sloppy re-print. Pages were crooked and words were cut off. If I were more familiar with the return/exchange process, I'd have it exchanged. Very poor."
2,Eh.,"I've been bellydancing since 1994 and have taken instruction from some of the best bellydance performers and teachers in the U.S. (Suhaila, Suzanna Del Vecchio, Cassandra...) This doesn't mean that *I'm* one of the best performers or teachers in the U.S., but it does mean that I know what good bellydance instruction is when I see it.This video has pretty good production values but the instructor's inability to dance to the beat and the fact that she doesn't explain proper execution of hip snaps, so that it looks like all of her students are just throwing their hips as hard as they can (my lower back hurt just watching, ow, ow, ow) are deal breakers for me. ""It doesn't matter if you do the move right as long as you're having fun"" is all well and good until you injure yourself. My shoulders did get sore from holding my arms out so much, but otherwise, I did not find it to be much of a cardio or strengthening workout."
2,Eh.,"Good production values couldn't outweigh Oreet's inability to stay on the beat and the fact that she doesn't fully explain moves that, if done incorrectly, can injure your lower back (hip snaps and pelvic locks.) ""Don't worry about doing it right, just have fun"" only goes so far where safety is concerned."
1,Wrong description,It doesn't work for the lift gate. It is for the rear glass on a 99-04 Jeep Grand Cherokee and not the tail gate
2,Disappointing,"I just bought my Jura Capresso Espresso in May, and the pump died on it yesterday. It never seemed to generate the 18 bars of pressure Jura Capresso claims: I wouldn't get crema no matter how coarse/fine of grain I ground my beans."
1,UK Deserves Better,"Seriously this was $1.00 at my local game store......NEW! But I'm gonna right a very short review for this piece of crap:Gangrel over Al Snow: *Headbangers over Animal & Droz: DUDVal Venis over Goldust: **Tiger Ali Singh over Edge: DUDKen Shamrock over Steve Blackman: *Christian & Sable over Marc Mero & Jacki: DUDNew Age Outlaws over D-Lo & Mark Henry: DUDTriple over Jeff Jarrett: *The Rock over X-Pac by DQ: **Steve Austin won a 4 way over Mankind , Undertaker & Kane: *When you got half the card DUDS and the best is ** stars...Ya know ya gotta something special don't ya? heh"
5,Best...Show Ever!,"I say this tape had everything you could want to see... I really enjoyed this tape because it showcased my favorite wrestler X-Pac at his best in a classic battle between the Rock for the WWF Title. It also had a great amount of comedy provided by Mr. McMahon and Co. All around, every match was great, including the main event, A fatal Four-Way match. Undrtaker vs. Kane vs. Mankind vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Wrestling fanscheck this tape out. By the way, the worlds greatest commentary team calls this event, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler & Jim Ross."
5,Great buy!,Replaced 2 of the vents in our rv with these. Looks and works great. A great deal. Would recommend to a friend!
2,"if your having trouble sleeping, watch this!","this has to be one of the worst films done in imax. did not go into detail about the park, very short film. didn't keep me interestead within the first 5 min. i have alaska, and africa, and they are fantastc. this is nothing like what i expected it to be, rent this first, actually if it's a free rental, don't even waste money renting it. and for god sake, DON'T buy it."
1,Want a a DVD about Yellowstone? This isn't it,This DVD is terrible. There is barely any coverage of the Park. It's mostly a reinactment of Indians settlers around a camp fire or explorers hiking and discovering Yellowstone. The DVD is horribly short too.
2,"Dreadful plot, nice dialogue","This is meant to be a mystery, but one can deduce the entire plot in almost the first couple of chapters. Then it gets boring waiting and waiting for the rest of the characters to stumble over it! A couple of the sub-plot characters (Regina & Lucy especially) are nothing more than boring caricatures. I was very disappointed in the whole satan worshiping mumbo jumbo mystery - doesn't seem like something Jane Austen would need to prop up her books.That said, the dialogue and general writing is great. I really enjoyed the first half of the book that centered on Kitty and Harry's courtship. I really wish there hadn't been all the aforementioned mumbo jumbo and instead Bebris had concentrated her obvious talents on the excitement of normal life."
3,deus ex machina,"An avid reader of both Jane Austen and historical fiction, I was looking forward to continuing the series started by Bebris in Pride and Prescience. However, as farfetched as the first book's plot was, Suspense and Sensibility is even more dubious and improbable.The beginning of the book is plausible, but as the story progresses, Bebris seems to lose control of the way the plot is going and simply gives a quick fix to the protagonists' dilemma. The solution is seemingly out of the blue and therefore ends the book on a feeble note.If you read Bebris' first Mr and Mrs Darcy book and want to continue the series as I did, borrow the book from the library first. That way, if you do decide that you like it, your money won't have been wasted on some frivolous romp."
2,Easy read but the plot is far-fetched.,Ms. Bebris' first Darcy mystery was much more believable. But still I enjoyed the interaction between Lizzie and Darcy.
5,"Original, witty and REAL","I loved this book! Jennifer Belle is now one of my favorite authors, and her book High Maintenance is already in my amazon shopping cart. Her writing is fresh, original and down to earth. She is an educated author who does not feel the need to flaunt it in the face of her readers. Her writing is factual, direct and realistic, without all the fluff and clutter of some fiction. She does not sugarcoat things, so if you can't take reality, this book is not for you. Also, I know when I read a book, I really don't care how the sky looked that day, or what the wall color reminds the author of. It always annoyed me when my lit professors pushed that gunk on us. I want to read the story, thank you very much. And Belle tells it ... like it is."
2,Hookerville USA,"Somehow I just cannot sympathize with the lead character in Going Down, a young woman who just HAS to make ends meet by selling her body because, ya know, there's just NO other way...Come on! I purchased this after reading Belle's ""High Maintenance"" which was just as light as ""Going Down"" but had a better story going on. ""Going Down"" did teach me a few tricks, pun intended, about the hooker/call-girl industry. For instance, using a table lamp to check Johns for crabs before any physical contact takes place. Also, how to merge your old hooker job with doing something a little more, uh, legal such as becoming a real estate agent. This is a good one to read in the tub then toss on your yard sale table. I hope that Belle will give us more material in the future because I do believe that she has some promise."
3,Decent story...,"This was a decent book. Yet, I do believe that the premise was not exploited, and in turn the characters (especially the main character, Bennington) were somewhat dull. For a first novel, this was good, but I think it could have been a lot better, and a lot ""meatier."" However, it was good enough that I do plan on reading something else by the author, just to see if she improves."
4,Loved it...,"It was the easiest reading I've had in a long time. Took all of 3 days, and that was stretching it. The writing was simple and enticing. Great read."
5,Have I really missed the point that Bad!,"This book is a great read. Mclaren's A New Kind of Christian was the first book of his which I read and opened my mind up for this deeper look at the individual issues. I am normally quite a quick reader, however with this I had to spend a lot of time. I found myself only really ever being able to read a chapter a night so that I could have the entire next day a school and work to formulate my thoughts and process what I had read. I found that I tend to agree with Mclaren more than Campolo however Campolos points were interesting because he brought a more fundamentalist point of view to the table, which made the book feel like you were attending a debate.---Incredably mind flexing---definately worth the money."
1,Disappointing!,I bought this toy for my kids on the memory of my own lemon twist I had as a kid. The loop that goes around your ankle is big enough for an elephant! There is no way for it to stay around a kid's ankle while they are trying to learn how to use it. I couldn't even keep it around mine! A big waste of time and money spent on this product!!
5,For a 7yr old boy,I bought this for my 7yr old son because they were using them at school. He has so much fun with it and for the price who can complain. The seller was great. Thanks for everything!!
1,This toy ROL,Rots out loud....not at all like the original Footsie...the ball at the end is too light to even go around! Waste of money!
1,zero stars,This toy is a waste of time and money. It is poorly designed and does not work due to the ball's lack of weight.
3,Skip Ball,I purchased this ball for an 8 year old girl. This is more suitable for an older child. You need to be more coordinated than an 8 -12 year old. The teenagers loved it and were able to swing the ball and jump at the same time.
1,yeah..,"This is a terrible product from the view point of some one who grew up with Skip It Jr. I am comparing the two, yes. The problem I have is the circle part is too big. You cannot just put your foot in and get it going. The ball is okay, no problems there. My Mom's ragdoll cat enjoys it very much. So, for that reason I didn't return it. I'm hoping that Skip It returns some day. Cause those are great exercise."
5,A perfect book for the first time Boxer owner,Excellent writing with just the right amount of history and breed specifics. My nine-year old son especially enjoyed reading it. The author's use of only Boxers with natural ears in her photos encourages owners not to clip their dog's ears.
4,Natural boxer pics,Liked the book for my children before we got the dog so they knew what we were looking for. Especially happy so many natural ears on the boxers pictured.
3,Prepare to learn Pali !,"As a newcomer to Buddhism and meditation I found this book rather difficult to get through due to the extensive use of Pali terms. There is a glossary which gets much use as one reads along going ,""now what did this word mean again?"" It makes for very choppy reading and understanding , the concepts do not flow when you have to learn foreign terms every sentence. It is a very thorough explanation of the anapanasati sutta."
5,Gripping Story,"Just as the title states; this is a gripping story. It's hard to imagine what these men went though being POWs for 40 months in consolitary confinement. They are true heroes along with the other raiders. May the three executed and one that died of malnutrition rest in peace.YOU CAN ORDER THIS BOOK FROM THE PUBLISHER FOR $14.95. The ones for sale here have autographs so they're expensive. I can't recall the name of the publishing company, but I know a guy named Stan Cohen works there and they're in Montana."
3,Effective use of the body mind connection,"This bookBodyminddoes a fantastic job of tying in the body, mind, emotions and thoughts together. If you're a coach, message therapist, personal trainer or similar bodywork specialist I highly recommended this book.Gregg Swanson"
5,Surviving Betrayal by Alice May,"Surviving Betrayal brings hope to the heart of any woman whose husband is addicted to sex, pornography or any other form of sexual betrayal. The author shares her story in the introduction and throughout the meditations. Somehow, in reading about her journey, it becomes clear that betrayal can truly be survived. The meditations not only offer hope, but practical tools for surviving each day, each relapse, each broken promise. I commend the courage of the woman who wrote this book."
2,Great Game - BUT IT'S NOT IN A TIN - as pictured,"THIS GAME IS NOTHING BUT FUN.But when you see the picture and think you order a nice game IN A TIN to give as a gift, you may feel let down. It's delivered and the ""TIN"" is a crummy cardboard box with a flimsy plastic insert, meant to hold the dice, the bell and the scorecards etc.- Well, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It leaks,"I purchased the Metropolis Wall Mount mailbox to mount on our front gate (no roof overhead). I thought the hinged lid over the slot would help to keep rain out of the box, but I was wrong, water seems to blow right into the box from around the front door hatch causing my mail to be soaking wet when I open it up. I will look to weatherproof the door to reduce this occurance but be aware that if you install this out in the weather, your mail will get wet."
1,Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible,"The concordance is only useful if you have ""Young's Literal Translation of the Holy Bible."" The bible is nothing more than his attempt to produce a translation as different from the KJV as possible. After reading his prefaces, I got the impression that he had a bone to pick with the KJV and/or was tweaking the proponents of the KJV at the time of his authorship. The concordance is incomplete, not user friendly, and just about useless."
1,Signs of the times,"How else to explain the proliferation of atrocious writing like this? Look no further than the subject matter. The prominence of the subject matter (Ventura) and the Jim Gray-esque tone (author/reporter larger than the story)of the book convey the stark reality of just how bad our pop culture has degenerated. Simply put: when telegenic political Puffed Rice like Ventura can be elected governor, we shouldn't be surprised by the public's appetite for shallow works from such ""literary talents"" like Tapper."
1,Couldn't even wear it!,"This costume was so poorly made, the hat was cheap and filled with foam to keep the shape. The sequins and beading were also very tacky. Seriously, I have seen better costumes for a child's dance recital. I also have an hourglass shape and this was snug on the hips and downright baggy in the bust. Save your money."
2,Not like the European version,"This perfume is not as good as the original version I bought in Germany years ago. It is a greenish color instead of amber and the scent is not as sensual and long-lasting. It does smell like a weaker version of the original, but it needs to be reapplied more often."
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I wish I hadn't bought this book. It's a reminder for me to not judge a book by its flashy/attractive cover. The book is overwhelming and not as organized as I would have liked. I wish that it would say how long each activity takes and, far more importantly, difficulty/skill/recommended age levels. It really is taking too much time going through the book and having to reject so many of the activities because they are clearly not age-appropriate for my young children. This book is really geared for older children."
3,REA Express Agency,"Ten Turtles to Tucumcari is the only published information on this historically important company. The author's mid-to-almost-upper level management view provides insights as to why REA failed, however, those insights do not address the close relationship between REA and US government. The book fits nicely with several REA items in my collection."
4,So Perfect for my little twin sisters,"My twin sisters Lanie and Abby love the mobile i like how it giggles Abby laughed at it once.Lanie is so little (very Premmie only 3 LB. & 8 ONC.)aBBY WAS 6 lb.& 12onc,) The bear is sooooooooooooo cute. gota love it we had to buy 2 bedding sets and mobiles. Big Sissy"
3,Overwhelming Perfume,I'm familiar with Dove and had expected the relatively neutral scent I'm accustomed to. This batch is so strongly scented that I'm not sure we'll use it. I guess we'll leave that to our guests... but I'm not even sure of that. We may donate it to a local shelter for abused moms and kids.
5,The Bible Of Rock N' Roll,"I always think of the Cheech and Chong movie where they are riding down the road and Tommy Chong is wired on caffeine spouting off about how Chuck Berry IS the king of rock n' roll, and truer words were never spoken. All the essentials are here. This is the roots. Chuck invented rock n'roll guitar as we know it.Probably one of my all time most listened to discs. It's more than five stars! If this is currently out of print it's shameful, no Berry compilation was ever better assembled than this."
2,Disappointing,"I too have been unable to find any of my child's textbooks available for download. It should have a feature like the turbo twist where you can put in your own questions. Without that feature, or the textbooks, its relatively worthless."
5,Comfort and affordability,This seat is soooo comfortable and does not hurt my butt bones at all! The price was very good also.
3,Meh,"It's not awful, I actually prefer the seat that came with the bike better. It'll do in a pinch, though."
2,Still too HARD of Seat for me,"Excellent construction and looks really nice.But still too HARD of a seat for me.One reason, no springs under the seat,just round hard rubber pads located where thesteel springs would normally be located.My suggestion if you want a better seat, look for onethat has actual steel springs under the seat."
2,If you are looking for comfort this is not it!!,"I bought this seat to replace the stock seat on my Schwinn Discover Hybrid Bike. I am a big guy, and after trying the stock seat I knew there was no way that it was going to work for me. Wanting to stick with Schwinn parts I ordered this seat and was very surprised to find that it is a little shorter front to back than the stock seat and only a faction wider than the stock seat. As far as cushioning on the top, my butt couldn't really feel the difference between the stock seat and this one. This seat is basically the Schwinn stock seat with a little different design on the top. I did find a Schwinn seat at a local big box store that is just what I was looking for, it is a lot bigger and plenty of padding, made all the difference in the world. So if you are looking for a more comfortable seat, keep looking this is not it!!!"
3,Not as good for skinny butts,"I bought this seat based on all the positive reviews so I was very excited to get it. But once I did.... well it's just not right for me. I have adjusted it many times, trying different positions, but it's just not right. I was so surprised by this that I went back and checked my order to be sure I ordered the right seat. Yes, I had ordered the one I intended, but upon my review of the other people's remarks, I noticed that many of those who left high praise are built ""different"" from me. I admit, I've got a skinny butt. And I think this seat is designed and better suited to people who need more realestate in a saddle. I think the padding is put in the wrong location for people like me.So my recommendation is, if you have a skinny butt, you'll probably want to pass on this seat."
1,Uncomfortable,"It did not feel at all like a ""pillow-top"". It was just as uncomfortable as the original seat that I wanted it to replace. I returned it and bought a different Schwinn seat that was way more comfortable."
2,Hard as a rock,"Sitting on this seat is like sitting on a 2 x 4. No padding at all. One of those cushy seat covers is mandatory with this thing and even then it's not very comfortable.It's the wide-butt style, so it will beat up your buns and not your crotch, if that's what you want.The springs underneath are fake, just there for appearance.I don't think you can buy a comfortable bike seat on the Internet. You gotta find a bike shop that caters to old people, if there is such a thing these days."
4,Comparably Better,"I didn't really have anything to compare it to until I rode my friend's bike the other day. Let's just say I had a stomach ache afterward, not because of food but because of something more guy-related. After that ride, I've come to appreciate my seat more. It's pretty cushiony. It's not exactly sitting on a cloud or pillow, but a nice bicycle seat."
1,Very Uncomfortable and Made of Rubber,"I realize other people gave this item great reviews, but I believe they are incorrect. First of all it is NOT a pillow-top, NOT soft at all. The material they used on the seat is like a thick rubber tube, NOT like the picture shows. The picture looks like it would be a nice soft fabric, this is NOT the case. As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat."
1,this is the most comfortable schwinn can get? really?,"pros: the shocks were good and the ride was smoothbut...cons: one of the most uncomfortable bike seats i ever sat on. it was way too firm and even the shape was a bit awkward. im a girl so i had a guy friend sit on it and he was amazed by how uncomfortable it was too. he didnt even want to sit on it for more than a few seconds.if you're really looking for comfort try the ""bell memory foam saddle"" bike seat from walmart. right now amazon only has the cover not the seat."
4,Good Seat,"A little harder than I expected, seeing that it was described as pillow top. Despite that, it's a good seat, and it's wider than my original, which is why I got this seat."
3,Good seat could be a tad softer though,"The seat is a vast improvement over the stock seat of my Schwinn 120. But I wish it was just a little,little (just slightly) bit softer. Still it is more than worth it for the price. I ordered it with the bike so I could get a super saver bundled shipping after reading other comments on the hardness of the stock seat."
4,Comfortable but low quality...,"Received the seat and put it on. Great. Sat on it and a few minutes later I noticed the material between the pads was starting to separate from the core of the seat. I imagine it will be a short time before the seat's covering starts to disintegrate. Too bad because it is a comfortable seat. Based on all the positive reviews I must have gotten a bad one. For ~15$ it's not worth returning. That said, I would recommend this seat."
2,bike saddle,Not to good for grown up. mostly plastic No springs just rubber.Gave it to my friend for his kids bike. Okay for him.Glenn
4,Excellent,I taught this series and found this to be an exceptional study. I learned something new in every lesson. I love the format and the depth of information. I would highly recommend this series.
3,Men In Green Faces,"The book ""Men In Green Faces"" was Fast Action - Seemed at times to be all make believe rather than a BOTS. Good book to spend time in a doctors waiting room"
4,Good Read,Didn't realize this was fiction until I finished. As a Viet Nam (Navy) vet this author knows his terminology as well as other stuff. I enjoyed this book.
3,"Fun, but short-lived, car toys","I bought these for small children who get stuck in the back seat of my car. (Poor babies!) Anyway, these toys lasted for one two hour car ride and that was great.They made pictures. They doodled. They practiced writing their names. It was much better than other games they come up with during car rides. And I didn't have to listen to a movie sound track.Everyone won."
1,"The worst bird ""field guide"" I've ever seen.","Mr. Tekiela must not be a bird watcher, he has no idea what a real birder would need to identify a bird in the field. Sorted by COLOR???, out of all taxonomical order. Not helpful and a big waste of time. What was he thinking? I would return the book, but it's not worth the effort."
3,Streets of Gold,"The book presents us the 19th century race to reach Timbuktu and return for a major prize. Only the British attempts are covered in this volume, eventhought the French were the winners. The explorers were trying to reach the African Eldorado, the City of Gold. This sounds just like the US Congress in 2010: trying to attain the City of Gold. In the 19th century they did not really know better. In 2010, the US Congess should know better. There is no City of Gold. Just a great Ponzi scheme to redistribute wealth. The Race for Timbuktu is not a fast read, but the time spent is well woth the insight into another time when men took chances for the sake of advancing their careers.Bob Lay[...]"
5,"From ""A"" to ""I Really Am Getting the Hang of This""","SalsaCrazy is teaching West Coast style, ""on 1,"" not New York style, ""on 2."" You may want to look into that. I highly recommend SalsaCrazy as a guide through on 1. It starts with basic steps without music, repeats with music, then singles out fine points in the ""move"" - good habits that need to be second nature before you advance to the tricky stuff. Fun, very thorough, well-paced."
2,DONT LIKE,NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS - DOESNT SEEM LIKE ITS FOR BEGINNERS. PLUS I WANT JUST STRAIGHT YOGA - I DONT WANT TO HAVE TO BRING IN CHAIRS AND OTHER ITEMS TO DO THIS WORKOUT. PRETTY RIDICULOUS IF YOU ASK ME. DIDNT LIKE AT ALL!!
2,"One extreme two another, Poor yoga DVD","I was very disappointed in this DVD. It went from one extreme to another, it would VERY VERY slowly show you step-by-step how to do the moves all the way to extreme rapid pace yoga, so fast you couldn't keep up with it. Sorry it just wasn't what I was looking for. Not enjoyable, hated it."
3,YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS,I found some of these exercises to be most difficult to do especially when it was designed towards the beginner.It would be good for the intermediate class.
4,relaxing visual and audio,"Having never done yoga before, I was surprised that something that looks so simple could be such a workout. This DVD is a pleasure to work out with."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"This was not my first Yoga DVD, but I so LOVED the 10 minute solution by Lara Hudson, that I thought this might be a nice compliment. The scenery is rather beautiful, but that's about the extent of my pleasant comments. I was bored to tears with this one. The 20 minute fundamental segment consisted of about 15 minutes in the downward dog position, describing in exhaustive detail each particular aspect of it. I was hoping to move a little more, and go over other fundamental positions. I wish I could return this tape, but I'm left with re-selling it in the marketplace. Keep looking."
4,Not for beginning beginners,"This is a beautifully done video that has well described routines that are easy to follow. The photography is beautiful and the progression is great, with many routines. One is able to progress and add additional strength building routines -- An all star videoHowever, having said all that -- It is NOT for ""beginning"" beginners. It assumes a level of physical strength and fitness that many just starting a fitness or relaxation program would not be able to perform. A better video for ""beginning"" beginners is [[ASIN:B000RE94LU Essential Yoga For Inflexible People."
5,Nice Yoga,"Been using this now for awhile from the beginning basics (nice and easy things) and through the weights and bands, still getting the hang of that though. Very pleased in the teaching and cues, plus feeling better. It got me back into a routine which is perfect."
3,"Really, really for beginners","After about a year of doing Wii yoga, I thought I'd give this try while traveling without the Wii. It's very, very slow paced, but certainly better than nothing."
3,Too much camera action,Poses: OK. Doesn't provide much instructions on how to perform correct poses: what you should and should not do. Assumes you have knowledge of the poses.Camera action: feels a bit amateurish. Eg. Zoom too much into the chest and then zoom out again. Sometimes you see more of the sky than the person. I want to see how a correct pose look like but sometimes they switch the camera to an angle which doesn't show the full picture of the pose. I wish they would just leave the camera alone.Quality of the film: a bit VHS-like. This is my 3rd yoga dvd and it just doesn't have the same quality as my other 2 by different instructors.I would not recommend this to a friend.
5,Good Choice for the Beginner,"As mentioned by previous consumers, this DVD takes the user through the explanation of Yoga's origins, the initial poses, short routines and longer routines. A great work out for all experience levels on one DVD."
3,Ok,"I like the pace of the routine but there was a lot of repitition/overlap between different sections of the DVD, for instance between fundamentals and fundamentals and beyond. Instructions for breathing technique and body position was very good.AH"
3,Ok video,Its an ok video...I don't use it that much at all.....guess I'm not really big into yoga yet.....I'm going to try to get more into it this year.
4,"Good, practical advice","I was looking for something that is very practical rather than theoretical. Although Murphy spends the first two chapters explaining the rational for solution focused therapy in schools, the rest of the book gives great practical advice in terms of techniques, exercises for students, and case examples. It's allowed me to work better with my own caseload of high school students.I also choose the 1997 edition, because it's $30 cheaper than the new version. But its still incredibly useful."
4,"Better than You Would Think -- In Fact, it's Really Cool!","The second best thing about this CD is you can play it for your friends and ask them to ""name that tune."" Since the tune doesn't match the style, it totally drives people nuts! It's hilarious to watch people bang their heads around tring to figure out D'yer Maker or The Song Remains the Same.But the best thing about Pickin' on Zeppelin is the music. While at rare times it can sound a little like glorified Muzak, the arrangements and the musicianship are second to none. This record is a lot of fun, and goes way beyond being a novelty because it sounds so great, and was obviously a labor of love. Pick it up ... you should really enjoy it."
5,A classic that gives the Big Picture,"A number of histories have explored the question of ""Why did the South lose/why did the North win"" the Civil War. This compact book answers that question as well or better than any of them. It is clear, concise, and convincing. It does not excuse, glorify, or compromise. The book is a great examination of the Confederate command structure and the overall conduct of the war, without going into detail on individual battles. There are plenty of other books for those. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War or anyone interested in questions of grand strategy and the political aspects of war."
4,Jane Wiedlin's album to be a sure hit.,"Jane Wiedlin's new album, Kissproof World, her latest full-length solo effort since 1992's ""Tangled."" The album shows true pain, gloss, and over-all fun. The first three tracks as the highlight of the album, especially ""Icicle."" Afterwards, such songs as ""The Good Wife,"" and ""Kissproof World,"" shine, with a few un-memorable tunes in between. Overall rating: 4. Not perfect, but even more than what one would expect from this talented song-striess."
3,smaller than it says,"Instruction pamphlet is wrong: the 12 qt holds 10 half pints, not 13; 8 pints, not 10; 7 wide-mouth pints, not 8 (also fits 6 wide + 2 narrow) .Now I want to do quarts, but don't think I really may. It says it holds 7 quarts. Five fit, in terms of side-by-side space, but both quarts and pint-and-a-half jars come so close to the top that I'm afraid to try it and maybe lose my stuff. This seems like false advertising.I have however successfully done pints and half pints. I wouldn't buy it if you want to can anything over pints."
2,Disappointed!,"The canner was advertised as holding 7 quart jars, however, it only holds 5. The mgf. made no apololgies for advertising it that way. I looked on the site last week & it was still listed as holding 7 quart jars. Sounds like fraud to me!!!"
4,Mirro 12 quart pressure canner,I searched all over for a reasonably priced canner and found it on Amazon. This canner is easy to use and cleans up quickly. This is a good product.
3,Two Piece Lens Set,Wide-angle lens does not seem to have any effect. Telephoto lens is weaker than I expected
3,Runs really small,I bought this for my 9 year old son and it barely fits. I would recommend buying 2 sizes larger.
1,not a very comprehensive dictionary,"Like many Hippocrine dictionaries, the number of words entered is few. I bought this dictionary for a friend because it has romanized spelling, but I found out that even that is not useful, because the english to hindi does not give romanized characters. So, I am returning it.There are many other much better dictionaries on the market."
4,Great source of protein,I love how much protein they have managed to pack into this 190 calorie bar. The only thing I thought might be improved is the banana flavor. I found it quite artificial tasting (unlike the vanilla and peanut butter flavors which I find authentic tasting).Otherwise I recommend this bar.
3,A nice try to spice up some phish,"""Bring your self on a new pyscadelic journey into the wonderful world of phish"" is something of what the liner notes said. I don't think so. This album was interesting, and i enjoyed listening to it, but its not a great album. The bluegrass isn't increadible and there are absolutely no solos that will rock your mind, which is what makes phish so increadible. Plus the song selection is terrible, taking songs from only ""Story of the Ghost"", ""Rift"", and ""Picture of Nectar"". I would be careful with this album for it is definantly not what i thought it would be. If you love bluegrass, check out Bela Fleck. If its phish you want to hear, well stick to Phish."
3,Elevator Phish,Phish is Elevator Music and Circus music anyway... What the hell do you expect from a BLUEGRASS ALBUM!
3,"It's just okay, nothing special","It's okay. Good reading and good topic to discuss. It's basically written off a man's point of view. Not really a whole lot of feed from others, it's one main and one opinion. But it doesn't take away from the book."
5,For Women & Men,"This is the 3rd book I have bought from Tariq Nasheed, I read this book to learn some of the game he's given to women, a I must add there is some good points he makes to have men be the best they can be for women...and for the women it's an eye opener and to have them more aware of what men do and the meaning behind their actions. I seriously would recommend this to any female and for the men as well."
4,gotta love the pouch,"I have been using these briefs for years and years. They simply fit better than typical briefs, for my anatomy, at least. Well-made, provides good coverage. Have to say, just like any consumer-grade briefs, over months of wear and washing, they thin out, start to sag, and the elastic weakens, but I can't imagine that's avoidable. Just replace them as needed. All in all, I advise all the gents out there to give the Pouch a try!"
4,Great Underwear,"Lousy shipping! UPS brings it to my community then hands it off to USPS. Tracking ends with ""final destination."" In reality, it means a couple of days of UNKNOWN WHERE IT IS!"
1,Read the fine print before you buy,"I bought this not realizing that these are not piano performances, but every track is played on a Pedal Harpsicord. Don't make the same mistake... If you want piano, get a different disc."
4,Understanind Unschooling,This book is very helpful if you do not understand what unschooling is and would like to find out what it is all about and how to go about it.
2,Boring,"These works deserve more than this. These interpretations are boring, unpersonal and all sound the same. Buy Roel Dieltiens's CD of the same pieces instead. He also uses period instruments, but plays with much more air, more variety and personality.This is just one piece after another sounding the same.....really boring"
5,BACK IN JAMAICA !,GREAT COFFEE! GREAT COMMUNICATION & SERVICE. DON'T PAY MORE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. TRY IT! I'M HOOKED!! YA MON!!
1,Who's designing these covers?!?,"Thankfully there's no spoilers this time out, so I'll be picking this up. Spoilers on the cover means no buys from me. And I ONLY buy the DVDs (can't afford to shell out $50 a month).However, this cover is just ghastly! Who's putting these together? I thought the Over the Limit cover sucked until I saw the Fatal 4 Way cover. I thought the Fatal 4 Way cover sucked until I saw this, this monstrosity!Ok, attendance is not so good, buyrates are in the toilet. Maybe, just maybe, they ought to focus on making STARS out of some of the guys on the roster? And they can start by plastering their mugs on these DVD covers instead of spoiler-laden action shots where one can hardly tell who's doing what to whom? I know, it sounds crazy, and it's not like they've ever done that before, and it's not like it ever worked. I mean Stone Cold never had his face on a PPV DVD... oh, wait, right, he did. Almost every other month in fact."
4,Dion is Great,"This set is a great review of Dion career from his start with the Belmonts untill the late 1980 as a single artist. If you like the music from the late 1950 thru the late 80 done by aartist who been their, has a great range and can sing you loveDion."
5,Great Flat iron with a great price,"This is the best price I have ever found for a chi and I am so glad I bought it, it works great and it got here pretty fast after I ordered it."
3,slow delivery,"I received my chi nano, but not until about 4 wks after ordering it. I chose this seller because all of the other feedback said how fast their items had arrived. Not really sure why my order took so long, I did email the seller and never received a response."
1,FAKE NOT REAL CHI,This is not a real Chi. I was very disappointed when I bought it. I did the research online and sure enough I was sold a fake. It did not do a good job on my hair either.
4,Watch out for limited expiry dates,LOVE the product. Was very disappointed that the expiry date was only 9 weeks away. I thought bulk purchasing was the way to go but there's no way I'd want my 9 month old to get through 12 boxes of these in such a short period of time! Makes me wary of buying bulk again.
1,Second ingredient: SUGAR,"I'm STILL looking for something to give my infant to snack on that will melt in his mouth.I can't believe anything specifically made for infants has sugar as the second ingredient, or as an ingredient, period.I'm shocked this product has so many good reviews. Do parents not read labels?!"
4,grandson loves mum-mum,"I found these at walmart and my grandson loves these ,when surfing on amazon and found them to be delived to me that was even better ,now I never run out of them because I alwas have mum-mum for my BentleyI open the cabinet and he sees them and knows they are for him"
4,Sobering but Insightful Truth!,"This book connects so many dots in terms of explaining how the Jude0 Christians worldview has been undermined by intellectuals, particularly in Europe. The 20th Century would end up being the most tragic of eras and some of the key reasons why are explained in this book. Seeing the underbelly of mankind is never easy but this book serves as a clear reminder what limits reason has and why so many many liberals are at war with nature. Clearly displays the sobering truth that ideas and values matter dearly!"
3,Pet Shop Boys - Somewhere,"No one updates showtunes quite like the Pet Shop Boys. On SOMEWHERE, they take the classic from West Side Story and bring it into the present, mixing a full orchestra with samples from the street (not to mention the quietly odd muttering ""I feel pretty"" towards the end -- different song, guys!). Still, the track is a grand sonic statement that loses a little in translation to the dancefloor. The Trouser Enthusiasts remove it completely from context, while Forthright dub completely jettisons the original except for the samples. The b-side, ""Disco Potential,"" doesn't live up to its potential. Stick with the orchestral version -- if you're not singing along, you don't have a soul."
1,what a waste,Pure crap! From the very beginning of this film I wished I had not wasted my money. Good thing it was a rental.
5,I haven't even seen it but...,"I have yet to see this movie, but that is not going to stop me from writing a great review in hopes of luring my friends here! I can see their faces now as the sit down to watch a one star movie with me promoting it! oh the hours and a half worth of pain that they will never be able to recover their entire lives!"
4,"Good, rigorous treatment of the topic","This is a good place to start delving into the subject. Contains a little more than the plethora of ""lifter"" website and in fact distinguishes that the ""lifter"" technology is but one form of research into ""electrogravitics.""This is a relatively thin book, but dense with information. The book starts with details of the state of the art in the 50s and 60s, and then wraps up with some essays from the 90s speculating on a link with the B-2 bomber. There are some current, short essays in the form of forwards and prefaces. The book has diagrams, a pretty good glossary, and a tech chronology."
1,Piece of Junk,"This may have been good when first sold, but Lentek doesnt supply any scents to attract mosquitos and just replies ""sorry, discontinued."" Don't waste your money."
1,dosnt work,"I had it out all summer, it didnt catch 1 mosquito. The sticky paper on the outside caught a couple of flies, thats about it."
3,Average mosquito/bug collector,"Well, it's not a complete waste of money (because it's inexpensive) but I can't say it saved us from a summer of mosquito bites. I think it's another tool to use along with Citronella and other bug deterrents, but I know they claim it takes a while to see any improvement. I'm just not too sure it really worked at all. There were some dead bugs stuck to the trap, but who knows if that is because they were attracted to it or just accidentally flew into it. We never had enough that we had to clean the trap at all. I think there must be better choices out there and in this case, you get what you pay for."
3,FUNNY,HOW U LIKE THINGS WHEN THEY 1ST COME OUT. I LIKED IT THEN BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT RECENTLY I DIDNT CARE FOR IT.
2,Not 17g of protein,"I almost bought this from here because I have free shipping and they were out of the banana ones. Not to knit pick, but beware, Amazon has this item incorrectly labeled as having 17g of protein, it only has 11g of protein. The only NuGo bar with only 2.5g of fat and 17g of protein I'm aware of is the banana chocolate ones (that's pretty incredible protein to fat ratio in a protein bar), and as I write this Amazon does not have that item available."
3,would be better without Joey Calderazzo.,"The playing of Branford and Jeff ""Tain"" Watts is outstanding on this disc. The compositions are really good. Unfortunately, Joey Calderazzo passed his ""audition"" with Branford somehow, and he is unfortunately part of his quartet now. Amazingly, this CD also won a grammy award this year, ahead of some albums that are much better, including Dave Holland's Prime Directive, a really great disc compared to this one."
1,Still waiting for a great Branford work,"Everytime I try to listen to this CD, it starts off nicely and then bogs down. I admit I've only listened a few times because I just can't stand this CD. It seems like the band never got their stuff together. They're obviously good musicians but they're playing is so untogether in some places that you can't tell whether it's the music or the performance. Not recommended."
5,"Memorable, Brilliant, Intelligent read","""Foxfire"" is a great read for many reasons, and works on many levels. The book portrays in vivid detail what its like to be a girl, in the male dominated society of the 50s.Instead of conforming to the social norms of the day, Legs leads a band of intelligent, free spirited girls to form their OWN world, with their own rules.The characters are well drawn, believable, and loveable.This book is brilliant also, in its depiction of good intentions gone bad, and how easily things can be taken too far. The horrible crime the girls end up committing is almost more horrific and shocking than their own ill treatment.The girls will become farmiliar to you, and join your landscape. Oates's style here is not readily accessible, but worth untangling.The book is passionate and near mythical, a must own."
4,Finished it in one sitting,This book is fun to read. The story is fast paced and I have never been so addicted to any character as I was to Legs. Her charismatic personality and true caring nature [even if that care made her friends go a little over the edge] forced me to never want to stop reading about her. The characters were spectacular and their endeavors were exciting and terrifying at the same time. I would just like to know why Legs gave up on Maddy so fast and vice versa. I need to go back and read it again.
3,Super irregular,"Second part of his huge history of Christendom. Up to the year 1100. Here's the review real quick: He writes fine, wonderful, great. Now, you have to be crazy about Catholicism and the history of their popes, heresies, councils, et al. because that makes for more than 50% of the book. When it gets out of this muddy, encyclopedic accumulation of names, it's as I said. But great passages are too interspersed to really make it a worth reading.So, basically it's a story of Catholicism, which I have nothing against besides its tediousness, only that it's so to the exclusion of any other point of view or even hint of interpretation. I think I'll keep trying with this author, though. The book is well presented and well packaged with lots of good biblio. I think it can get more interesting in the next volumes."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"Since entering college, I have had a hard time finding the time or interest in reading novels on the side. Until ""The Quince Seed Potion."" It was amazing. I read it straight-through, unable to detach myself from the story. It's a journey through Iranian history, while following the life of Serveali a servent for a prominent family. Baharloo lives in the minds of his characters and as the reader you feel greatly attached to them as well. Read it! You will not be disappointed!"
3,Contemporary Gothic Tension,"I've had Asylum sitting on my ""to read"" shelf for a few years. I finally got around to reading it and I was pleased by the novel. McGrath is a talented writer with a talent for maintaining just the right level of tension despite the lack of much action - Asylum is more cerebral than action oriented. There is a definite gothic feel to the novel and McGrath never allows the reader to escape the forboding feeling he puts forth in the opening pages."
4,"An interesting read, many layers to explore","I read this in a reading group program. Interesting ideas, compulsive behavior,multiple dysfunctional personalities, serious organizational failures, and more.Well written, an enjoyable reading experience."
5,Fascinating modern gothic novel,"This novel is well written and engrossing. McGrath really has a knack for a truly gothic style of writing and in this work, embraces and redefines the idea of ""modern gothic."" The characters are flawed and yet, the reader still stays with them, almost in agony as the next turn is revealed. A short novel, the effects of this work on the reader last."
4,The Story of Stella & Edgar,This book is the perception of the doctor who is treating Stella & Edgar. Stella develops a obsessive love for Edgar who is in the asylum for brutally murdering his wife. Stella blindly gives up everything and everyone for him even when Edgar is abusing her. A very disturbing story depicting why some women stay with abusive partners. It is very well written.
2,UGH! I've never been so angry for wasting my time on a book!,"Sometimes I wonder if reviewers simply read only the first half of the book and then crank out their reviews...Because I did find the first half of the book relatively interesting with the writing and the author's ability to create an image of the scene. Stella's character development was completely unbelievable how from one moment she is an obsessed lover, to suddenly rational to irrational to...I just didn't buy it...and the narrator just started to irritate me by the end. I was extremely disappointed."
4,Throw caution to the wind & just enjoy the ride!,"An excellent story! Stella finds herself married to the rather dull forensic psychiatrist Max Raphael; they have a child named Charlie. Life is good yet predictable. They move into a house on the grounds of the asylum where Max works. Stella always feels like a woman playing the role of staff wife and mother. It's a skin that never seems to fit (very similar to Nora in Isben's ""A Doll House""). When she lays eyes on Edgar Stark she is at once completely lost and found. Edgar is the forbidden fruit, a dark dangerous and sexy patient in residence. He awakens a hunger so forceful Stella could not - would not ignore. The reckless decisions she makes slowly destroys the prison that was her life leaving her no choice but to continue moving ahead. Away from Max who treats her like a fragile lady; towards Edgar who treats her like a woman and makes her feel alive! Although they all meet a rather tragic end, what a ride!"
4,Strange love story.,"The characters in this tangled web of insanity inspired love, bring passion and depth to the concept of obsessive love. The narrator relates the tale with his own obsessions mixed in and the ultimate outcome is unbelievable. An engrossing and startling story of desire and love-madness"
5,Great Product,I am pleased with my purchase of the Kids Kraft plastic cookware set. It coordinates great with our primary colors Kids Kraft Island Kitchen (which I highly recommend.) The plastic is very heavy and durable. Great product!
3,Sweet,"It would be wonderful if the plastic were stronger or even a metal material!!!! More durable ad real looking would be woth a little extra money.....and to make the siverware metal would have been perfect......and how about adding colored plastic glasses, afterall, aren't glasses more familiar to a child than COFFEE CUPS!!!! I seached for weeks and weeks for a REALLY NICE table settings set and yours was the best I could find but not what I wanted."
5,Sturdy dishes,"Made from a sturdy plastic. I was concerned my 18 month-old granddaughter would not break them, but they were very sturdy. No worries."
2,Too thin,When I saw this advertised it gave me the impression of being a little thicker than it actually is. If you only want something to prevent fingerprints and scratches it's okay.
3,"Not sure what to think, despite having loved this thoroughly","I LOVE it. It works in the oven, it works on the stovetop, and I cook EVERYTHING in it.And now... it's starting to have scratch marks, which look like they may have rust forming. The idea of a warranty is great, but I have no idea how to pursue it from here.I want another of these... because it is seriously my go-to cookware... but I'm just not sure about the ""guaranteed"" longevity it is supposed to offer. I've had mine for about 3 years now, and it's served me very well, but it looks like it's already due for a replacement."
4,Classic Old School Westcoast P-Funk,"Great debut album from San Francisco's RBL Posse with some bangin joints like Ain't No Joke, More Like An Orgy, Sorta Like A Psycho & the smoke anthem Don't Give Me No Bammer."
1,"Seconding the review by ""Skisko""",I agree 100% with this review. The premise behind the book has great promise; but is a very painful read and a great disappointment.
5,Excellent period movie!,"I first saw this movie in high school some 30 years ago and subsequently searched hi and low to own my own copy. The period costumes are wonderful as well as the language and content. What no one has brought into the open so far in these reviews, Anne Boleyn was very much in love with someone else when King Richard became attracted to her. She really had no choice in the matter and therefore became a victim. She was forced to marry him and when she did finally turn her heart to him she was betrayed. This is a heart wrenching story, a woman served a grave injustice. It will always remain a five-star movie to me!"
3,Note for Instant Video Purchasers,"Although there is a link for the two-movie DVD set that directs you to Amazon Instant Video, be warned that the Instant Video includes only the first movie - Anne of the Thousand Days.Amazon quickly refunded my money when I noticed that the movie I wanted, Mary Queen of Scots, was not included in the Instant Video purchase. So, no complaints on the customer service -- but this is a not quite accurate link that, for some reason, has still not been fixed."
5,one of the great films of the 60s,"Genivieve Bujold was perfectly cast as Anne Boleyn. She gives a career making performance that takes her from a carefree passionate young girl, to a woman engaged in a duel for power, to an uneasy wife, to finally a tragic and endearing figure. Bujold never rose to such great heights again.Richard Burton becomes what we imagine Henry the VIIth was. Handsome, yes. Full of life and passion but selfish, ruthless and in the end, breathtakingly cruel. This film was a triumph of historical fiction."
4,Incredible,"I found this book incredible, due to the fact that Chet was high or strung out most of the time, yet he still found time (with the help of wife, Carol) to write about periods in his life which affected him most. Interesting read due to the fact that there isn't much about Chet in print."
4,Amazon Delivers Rare Book of the Memoirs of Talented Man's Dissipation by Heroin,"Amazon Delivers Rare Book of the Memoirs of Talented Man's Dissipation by HeroinChet Baker was a rising star on the West Coast jazz scene in the 1950s. He had a mellow sweetness of tone on the trumpet and with his singing. He was good looking. His memoir shows he was constantly being arrested or fired or deported by his need to get high on heroin.The book is inciteful, revealing and appears to be completely honest. Unfortunately, his story is not unique. Many jazz musician used heroin in the 1950s. In his autobiography, Miles, Miles Davis talked expansively of his own use and that of many others on both coasts who used it even when they could dee the damage it did to their colleagues."
1,pos,First of all I made sure to order the black one to not draw any attention but they sent me the loud green one anyways. It doesn't really matter anyways though because it doesn't work on any tv's that I tried.I've tried it on a dozen or so tv's new and old major brands and nothing. I would love to recommend a product like this but it doesn't work. Annd yes I was 5 feet from each tv and held the button down continuously for over a minute.
5,Good Quality,Cord seems to be well made. My last one failed at the connection. It was constantly being bent and it ended up sheering the wire inside. This one seems that it will prevent this from happening. Good sound quality too.
2,Great buy!!!,This is great product. It stays in place very well and can be moved easily from car to car. Will highly recommend it.
5,Works great!,"I bought this cable to use in my car. I have a 2006 Scion xB with an AUX plug for MP3, CD & Tape players. This is just the cable for me to be able to use our Dell DJ's in my car. The sound quality coming through the radio is great with no distortion or static. It's long enough that backseat passangers have control of the devices without having to reach. I am very happy with this product."
5,Brilliant,"If you ever in your life enjoyed the music of Cheap Trick, The Posies or Social Distortion this is for you. If you never liked the above mentioned bands, this album is still for you.More hooks than my Grandfathers tackle box. Check it out, these guys should be hosting MTV's next Spring break beach house jam!All joking aside, these guys have got it. Something for everyone."
3,Norwalks Most Wanted are the bomb!,"Chicano rappers Latin X and 100% Mexican from NMW are pretty dope. This is not one of my favorite chicano rap groups but I certainly do like them alot. Some of my favorite songs are ""This Is NMW"", ""Dont **** Wit a Mexican"" and ""We Do Damage"" where they speak about the fake chicano rappers, Kid Frost, Mellow Man Ace and especially Lighter Shade of Brown which you could tell they dont have respect at all for them. Keep making more hits so I can bump in my system NMW!"
5,Sony ECM-R100 mike,"I already own one of these mikes, but the wire is breaking and I needed a backup. Apparently Sony is no longer making this mike, but I absolutely love it so I purchased it used. It was in great condition. Very proud I found it."
5,Received as promised.,"Received in a few days as promised. Getting hard to find in stores, good way to stock up."
4,Sefl Cleaning Shaver Soulution,This producet works well with my Remington Electric Shaver. This purchase of 6 reduces the cost of a solution that is necessary to change about every 30 days. Very cost effective.
1,Speaker out in less than two weeks!,"After only two weeks use (on and off, for no more than an hour each time), the left speaker went out... many Sony headbands do this, but two weeks??!! In short, it's cheap quality."
3,only option for my degus,"this is our fourth try at this wheel, the first try lasted a few months before my degus chewed the nut that covers the screw that holds the wheel on the base.We replaced it with the same one and this one lasted 6 weeks before it cracked across the back of the base. The company sent us a new one for free but apon arrival we noticed the wheel part was cracked in shipping. We swapped the base from the new one with the wheel of our old one to make a fully functioning wheel. We reinforced the back base part with a plastic tie wrap to stop some of the tention being put on the base. This one lasted a few months and broke in the same place the other one did. all the other style wheels are too easily chewd apart or made of wire that will damage degus feet.degus are smaller than chinchillas so what i dont understand is why they keep breaking it?we reinforced this new one the same way we did before so hopefully it lasts a while longer, especially for the price of it."
2,Not good for little feet,"This is not a good wheel for pets with little feet because of the little slots where it attaches. I wanted a wheel for my wide hedgehog, but this one is no good. I went with the Flying Saucer wheel because it seemed to be better for their bodies and how they run. Plus this arrived cracked. I sent it back. Oh well!"
1,aweful,"this wheel is by far the noisiest ever! It broke with in just a few months, and my chin was still a baby so there was no reason for it, he did not chew on it or make it more likely to break in any way.... simply just a pile of junk"
3,Eye looks strange,"I can confirm that Eastwood's right eye (the left side on the poster) does indeed look strange. I'm not sure if this is from the original image or peculiar to the print, but it definitely looks unusual - it's a black splitch that makes it look as though he's blind in one eye. It's enough of an attention grabber that it may prevent me from ever really enjoying the poster, but I'm going to make the effort and hang it up. Perhaps at a distance it won't be noticeable, but I doubt it."
2,Okay you can ungrit your teeth!,"Unfortunately serving as the album that gave Paul a badmusical reputation much of ""Wild Life"" sounds featherweight.But the firey opening jam of ""Mumbo"",the unltra lo-fi ""Bip Bop"",the sumpteous raggae cover of ""Love Is Strange"" do serve ashighlites that illustrate a certain point in McCartney's carrer.But overall this just isn't a completely suitable first showingfor Wings and should be a late purchase-probably."
2,Too many outside factors hampered this release.,"This album came out at a time when band members were at odds with William Lee Golden. Not to harken on any of the things that I heard occured, but when you hear that the Oaks would go on tour and Golden wouldn't talk to then the entire time, you figure their recording career would suffer, and it did.This cd features a forgotten single, ""Juliet,"" that is unavailable any where else. But other than that, this album is very depressing.This album was the last that Golden appeared on before Steve Sanders replaced him.I would recommend this for those wishing to add ""Juliet"" to their collection, or hard-core fans of the Oaks."
4,fun toy for all ages,"Went old school with Christmas gifts this year. Bought this, slinkies, board games and balloon toys and the kids just loved it. My kids ages range from 5-12. Fun for all ages."
1,Pile of junk,Typical Microsoft has decided to do their own thing with respect to Bluetooth. So good luck if you get a Bluetooth enabled phone soon (or already have one) or get a Bluetooth-enabled PDA or digital camera or want to set up a Bluetooth network.Microsoft's Bluetooth once again is NON-COMPATIBLE with just about anything other than their keyboard and mouse. Might as well just get a regular wireless KB/Mouse from Logitech for all the functionality this thing is gonna give you. You'll have a better product and won't have to worry about incompatibility with your other Bluetooth devices.
1,"great idea, terrible execution","Not worth the time, effort or expense. Would have been worth it if it worked half of the time. When the battery goes...apparently so does the memory of the system that you've installed this keyboard/mouse. Very frustrating. Currently used as a paperweight and reminder to check here before making a purchase such as this."
4,Off the hook,"I found Dogism quite intriguing. Once I got past the part about the size of the females, I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to find out so bad what is going to happen to Lance. This non-stop page turner had me up in the night. The only disappoint to the book was the end, because it left me wanting more. So I guess I have to wait for the sequel to find out what's going ot happen to him."
5,refreshing new Quo,"Quo's album,""Thirsty Work"" was the first new Quo album in 4 years and their sound is refreshing but still has that Quo rhythm.""Going Nowhere"" opens the CD with a nice vitality and is followed by the uptempo ""I Didn't Mean It"".""Confidence"" is certainly one of the best tracks on the album and ""Soft In The Head"" reaks of the infamous Quo 12 bar.""Sheri Don't Fail Me Now"" is an obvious choice for the single with it's wonderful melody and""Back On My Feet Again"" and ""Ciao,Ciao"" also are very well-produced with the latter having a middle-eastern flavor to the melody.""Restless"",an old country tune could have never been done by the old band of the 70's and is one of the slower ballad-type songs as well.I love this CD and play it 2-3 times a week in my car."
4,Great Study,"This is a great bible study. Very educational, includes timelines maps and interesting facts from time period. Each lesson includes a relevant background of the prophet under study that week. Aside from the historical information the study provides spiritual insight and time for reflection and prayer. This bible study is well worth the time. Like most, the lessons are divided into daily sections, which are not overwhelming and short enough to do each day. It also leaves a lot open for discussion, good for small group studies."
3,"Not as good as the other ""Zephyr Song"" single.","""The Zephyr Song"" was the second single of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""By the Way"", and like the other singles from the album was released in two parts. Each contains two studio b-sides, in the case of this release ""Out of Range"" and ""Rivers of Avalon"" (note that this CD may be identified by the placement of the band name ABOVE the song title).The title track is a breezy pop song, truthfully one I'm not overly fond of-- I actually quite enjoyed many pieces on ""By the Way"", but this one lacked any real bite to it.Both b-sides are quite oddities in the Chili Peppers catalog-- they've got this sort of '70s arena rock vibe to them, complete with organ lines. Neither are superb, but both are certainly worth a listen."
5,Awesome!,this is one of my top favorite movies! it's truly the best. it will make you laugh forever with the great casting of Tom Hanks. And not to mention Corey Feldman...he's so hot in this movie! I love it. You won't be sorry.
3,Your neighbors are like a box of chocolates....,"You never know what they're doing!The Burbs is one the box-office flop comedies Tom Hanks did before his breakthrough performance in ""BIG"". While the movie has its flaws there are some hilarious moments.Tom Hanks plays a man on vacation at home. He and his friends are out to get to the bottom of the mystery and their quest to find the truth about a missing neighbor. A plot full of funny twists and turns, Hanks is solid here showing us his future greatness. The movie is definitely worth a rental."
5,RAY YOU'RE NEIGHBORS ARE MURDERING PEOPLE!!!,"This is the greatest comedy of all time,second is Clue. It has a whole bunch of great lines and an outstanding score by Jerry Goldsmith (Patton). Even though Tom Hanks is really, really funny, the best character in this is Art, played outstandingly by Rick Duccomon. You have to add this to your comedy collection. The movie itself is about three men (Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, and Rick Duccomon) who get obssesed with what is going on in Tom Hanks' neighbors house. Art thinks that the neighbors are killing the other people who used to live there. But he can't be right. Can He? This is a must have for people who love comedy and mysteries. The lesson: Don't judge a person by his cover....... but don't be too careful."
5,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Funny movie,HaHaHa","Hahaha!This movie is the best comedy ever! Tom Hanks is good and the story is good. But Art eats too much.I wish that the Klopek's was my neighbour's.And I hope that they are doing a sequal.A comment from the movie ""My brother the Docter""."
3,"hey 70's & 80""s friends........",Its great!!! Only thing is I never thought it was sooo cheesy back then. But oh well a bit of nostalgia Its ok for the $$$.
5,Woody's Done it Again!,"It simply reinforces all the things I ever thought about Word--love it/hate it, you gotta use it or be left in the lurch! The workarounds for the little 'undocumented features' in Word alone are worth the cost of the book. Stop beating your head against a wall and beat feet to buy this book. As a professional MS trainer, I've taught many of these tricks and wished someone else would make the 'truth' about Word public knowledge. Well done, Woody!"
5,"It's not Dean Koontz, but it's excellent","The book is a must for most users of Office. I did not say developers, I did say users. Developers will love this book, but where the Office Help files and the other miscellaneous Help files that I've collected are, well, helpful, this book explains it all. It starts from the basics and allows you to advance your skills.I highly recommend this book for all Office users. You can then get rid of the MS Press books that clutter your refernce shelf.My Dean Koontz reference is a comparison of excellent fiction to excellent non-fiction (unless we're talking about unreported bugs at MS)."
2,very flimsy,"What a mis-leading name "" Magnum "". When it arrived, the screen is so flimsy that it was bended out of shape. The top and the bottom are make of, again,flimsy plastic. Quality is comparable to the McDonald throw away toys. Instead of this, there is another identical model which is about 20% larger with metal top and bottom . I think I bought it at Petco a few years ago. It costs more but hell of lot stronger and above all, not misleading !"
5,bird feeder,"i bought this for my mother who is am avid bird feeder, she loves it. now has so many birds feeding she is complaining about the cost of sunflower seeds"
1,Completely And Utterly Useless iPod Remote,"This unit has a Menu button that does not function with the iPod. In fact, this remote does not allow you to navigate on the iPod at all!If you were expecting a remote control for your iPod keep dreaming. The fact that Apple would attempt to sell this item to iPod owners is shameful."
3,Poor Technical Editing,"There are numerous mistakes in the examples. I am not done with the book and have already found one file that won't compile and an interactive web page, that demonstrates do/while loops, that does not execute accurately. I have tried to contact all the email addresses I could find on their website and all but one have been returned as invalid. If you are brand new to programming I would hesitate purchasing until they have adequate technical support."
3,Paper rolls,"This product was a little disappointing. We saved a little under $10 by ordering on Amazon but the paper quality isn't quite as good. We won't purchase again. I didn't know what to expect. The paper isn't bad just not what we're used to. Shipping was quick and on time.Updating - after the person using the paper has gotten in to the second and third roll, they have decided that it is ok to use. I think he's getting used to is now. Will order again."
2,low budget,"This isn't a movie a all. It's just low budget graphics, classical music on loop and a voice over. Even in the rare occasion that there is a real photograph of something, the cheesy graphics are still there in overlay. It's physically impossible to watch at a point.The main gist seems to be an attempt to compare dark matter with our subconscious mind and all the parallels seen between the two. I gave this 2 stars for the attempt."
5,"Breaking new barriers, Royo does it again.","Being a long time fan of Luis Royo's art work, I expected some of the same poses, same features and same colors in III Millenium. To my wonderful suprise, he has taken a dip in the deep end of his talents and emerged with fantastic, horrific and touching artwork. He is, without a doubt, a master at his craft and transmits feelings to the viewer that are like a raw slap in face. For those of us who appreciate fine art, there is no comparison."
2,didn't work on stretchy jeans,I tried these patches on my True Religions and it didn't hold the material together. May not work with any jeans that stretch.
5,Sailboat Use,I purchased two of these in 2006. We took them on our sailboat for three years of cruising in tropical waters. When on deck I always kept one clipped to my life vest. Never any problems of any type. After returning I left them off the charger for almost two years. When I turned them on again they both worked fine. The batteries had held their charge for that long. I have since charged them again and they both still work flawlessly more than five years after purchasing.
4,marinagirl,Great product -very small make sure to clip it to your body with a leash because it wont float and the long antenna can catch and pull it off if you use clip included-clip stickes out more than an inch from back of Radio soo its kind of useless as far as a space saver.
5,Fantastic,"I think that the song ""here comes the knightowl"" is the greates hit, it is simple, not so old fashioned."
1,Flimsy Design,I really regret I purchase this. The design is very flimsy. Highly recommend purchasing other types of fish grap like the Berkley Lip Grip design.
1,The failed attempt at 3-D spoiled the movie.,"I saw this movie when it was in theatres with the gray glasses and was amazed. It was the only 3D movie I had seen where the effect actually ""worked"". I have only seen similar results in IMAX 3d movies. I was thrilled when this came out on DVD, but I was disappointed as soon as I opened the box and saw the Red/Blue glasses. I spent a full hour trying different color/tint/brightness/contrast settings to get the 3D effect to produce something besides a double image. If the scene I freeze-framed was adjusted properly in the foreground, the background would have a double image and vice versa. I ended up taking the glasses off and watching the last half of the movie in Black and White. The movie was campy fun, but not worth owning without the 3D effect."
1,Good idea - poor execution,This film is rarely in focus - a key to 3-D effects & eyestrain. NOTHING comes off the screen. Some scenes do actually show some depth but not enough to make the film worth sitting through. Let's hope someone trys the polarized version on DVD and keeps it in FOCUS.
2,keep looking,"We think its a bit of a piece of, well, crap. Kinda tinny and hard to open. If it wasnt such a hassle, I'd probably send it back. I just dont think they make good mail boxes, we are going to have one custom made...."
1,Cheaply made....,"Very fustrating product, it was hard to use, and kept falling apart, we had to tie it together, and still couldn't get it to work, we ended up just throwing the balloons, it was easier!!and they went farther"
2,I didn't like it,"The original cover did not look like cartoon characters either. But I guess after six years you have to change the cover. But anyway, I didn't like this book. I thought it was dumb. The first one wasn't all that either but I bought it thinking it was going to be like the other one... NOT"
4,These headphones are fantastic,"My only gripe with these wonderful headphones are that the wires at both ends eventually go bad at 3-6 months of really heavy use (I'm pretty ruthless with my equipment). Otherwise, I can't say enough good things about these -- the cord is of ample lenght, fits in your ears well, fits your heads well, good sound range, low profile, goes well with the black ipod. Its too bad these aren't available at more places, but they are very reasonably priced at Amazon. I'm scared they will be discontinued at some point -- I'd be crushed. Four stars for the flaw at with the wire connection at both ends (the low price makes up for it)."
5,One of my favorites,"Amanda and Lee, they are so great! It is 2 am at night and a just finished watching Series three of Scarecrow and Mrs. King. What does that tell you??? Yaaa, you absolutely right it is a great show and definitely a great season (3) Please let us watch the end, in which I mean bring out the last season!So much memories come back watching these Series, and sure we cant compare it to the standard of today's television...yet it is nice to see what is going on in the agency and of course with Amanda and Lee. It is nice to see how much ""Amanda"" has learned in comparison to the first season. I cant wait to watch it with my daughter when she is older (now 4 years old). Kate and Bruce if you ever read the reviews ... you created a good show along with all the others who put a show like that together. Good JOB!"
4,good memories,I have enjoyed watching Scarecrow and Mrs King. This is a show that I grew up with. Such nice memories
4,"Better than Season 2, but Missing 2 Episodes On Streaming","Season 1 is my favorite, and Season 3 is better than Season 2 because they allowed some of the cute humor to come back in - without being nutty. While enjoying the 3rd series using my Prime account, I ran across 2 episodes that require payment to view (numbers 11 and 16, Long Way Home and Triumverate). I contacted A m a z o n and they are working the problem. In the very unusual event that they do not have rights to stream those 2 episodes, which I find not likely ... then they will have to be purchased. Anyway... I will keep an eye on it and remove reference to it from this writing when they fix it. The Amanda King character seems to show some growth in this season. It's important to keep the changes slow and steady or the series gets stagnant. On the other hand, if she radically changes, or her family dynamic becomes complicated, the series loses its romantic tension. I think they do a good job of keeping it going in season 3."
5,SteppenwolfRocks,I find this album very inventive and mostof all its classic steppenwolf...which was very much apart of my commune life backin the 60's and early 70's.
1,Misleading Work,"The book (which I read in a library) is very weak in original ideas, research, and scholarship. The author presents nothing believable about his case (that the de la Pena Diary is a fake) that can be taken seriously by anyone. Just recently the de la Pena Diary was auctioned off for nearly quarter million dollars! Not bad for a work that Mr. Groneman wants to call a fake in his 'curio' of a work."
1,Difficult to use - dosent cover all of cart,I thought it was difficult to get on the cart. It didnt cover all of the cart and my son was able to touch exposed areas. I ended up having to disifect the cart as much as I could. Too much of a hassel.
2,Not Worth It!,"I bought this item because I am a total germ-phobe. When I put my son in it, he managed to find all the areas the the Shop N' Play didn't cover. His hands were all over the sides of the shopping cart and especially the handle of the shopping cart. I ended up purchasing a hand-made shopping cart cover from a local craft fair, It works wonders and even included two small pillows."
2,Don't recommend,"I don't like this item very much. It doesn't cover the sides, which of course, are the first thing she grabs. It is also very difficult to get it into the shopping cart while holding a baby. I do like the toys attached to it. I use it to cover highchairs as well but this isn't what is was designed for so it is doesn't fit very well."
2,A cure for sleeplessness,"I know that Dr. Cullen knows what he is talking about, I know that this book is the standard to which other books on management are held, and it is almost always required reading, but this book is instant somnia. Some of the information also seems a little dated and cliche now that every manager in the country uses these techniques. Reading it in conjunction with The Chef Manager really helped me plow through."
2,Not great,"I bought this book for a course (as it was suggested) and found it does not have all that you need, to many case studies not enough content."
4,A fine collection of English Concert Handel,"This six disc set encompassing most of Handel's concertos (including the big Op. 3 and Op. 6 sets) consists of recordings made from 1981 to 1984. It's well worth having for the excellent Op. 6 set alone, which was previously available only in the form of three separately-packaged, full-priced CDs. Pinnock and the English Concert play with smoothness and finesse, and the recordings collected here range from very good to excellent. The Royal Fireworks Music, like the Op. 6 set, is on the excellent side; the Op. 3 perhaps less sparkling but never dull or below par. The Water Music was (understandably) a best-seller in its original release. At this kind of price, and with this kind of playing, the English Concert set should be a cornerstone of any Handel-lover's CD collection."
5,Laugh Out Loud,"I loved the calendar ""The 365 Stupidest Things Ever Said"" -- so when I found out there was also a book by the same people, I had to get it -- and it didn't disappoint me! These quotes are hysterical! A great variety here -- from politicians to celebrities, from current figures to historical ones. It's a lot of fun -- although it's a lot like potato chips....you can't stop reading these quotes!"
2,just another stupid quote book,"This is a pretty good book. theres millions like it. some things said in the book can be read in one of the millions, so if you buy this book theres no need to by one like it."
2,You'll especially love it if you're a liberal ;),"We chuckled every now and then, but it quickly became obvious that the authors seem to think that only conservative politicians say stupid things. I've read about 75% of it and haven't read one ""stupid"" thing said by a notable liberal politician (there's probably 1 or 2 in there), but I've read at least 30 ""stupid"" things said by conservative politicians. There's also plenty of quotes to insult you if you aren't pro environment, etc. The book is a product of our opinionated and divided times. I own several books on quotations, and find the better ones to be more ageless. Keep shopping."
1,nothing i haven't heard elsewhere,"This book feels to me like a compilation of the simplest pieces of other books on the subject. I didn't get a real authoritarian feel here, which I think is necessary in a 'How To Make Money' book. With the way the world is now, anyone can claim themselves to be an expert, and here, I did not see anything other than regurgitation. If you are looking for a book on this subject, I would go with Carol Harris's book."
3,Why not learn some French?,"TINTIN EN AMERIQUE has no real plot or character, just plenty of empty action -- he runs across the entire continent as fast as possible, meets every stereotype, and escapes danger largely through blind luck. Unlike the books from LOTUS onward there was no research for AMERIQUE, so it's America as seen from postcards & pulp fiction, resulting in the least interesting TINTIN book this side of IN THE LAND OF THE SOVIETS.The simplistic action does make it useful for studying French (which is, after all, the language in which Herge wrote it), and it does bridge the gap between TINTIN AU CONGO and CIGARE DU PHARAOH. After you've read all the others, AMERIQUE lets you complete your collection knowing that yes indeed, you have seen all there is to see in the TINTIN universe."
3,Not Compatible with iP4000,"I bought these cartridges with the assumption that they would work with the iP4000...they didn't! It's listed as compatible with BCI-6 cartridges but they're not. I also didn't receive the photo paper it lists. I went ahead and absorbed the loss because I didn't have the time to go through the return process. I'll try them again but will be clear with ordering BCI-6 series ink, and not the BCI-3 series. Price seems fair so I'll wait to do another review when I get the right cartridge to work in my printer."
1,Not Canon Ink,"I just received two of these today. Upon opening the plain, grey plastic pouches, I was very disappointed to find non-Canon cartridges. In fact, the cartridges had no supplier or manufacturer information on them at all. $42 is rather steep for ""compatible"" cartridges, so back they are going. At least I had no problems with Amazon's customer service. I am getting a full refund and prepaid return shipping. I don't know if this is just a glitch, but I would be wary of them."
4,The New Testament,"The New Testament Study, by Bruce M. Metzger is a very informative book that has helped me tremendously with my knowledge and understanding of the history behind the Bible."
2,Great Fit but VERY Bad Wiring!,"When I first put them on I loved the fit, they were light weight.... then when I plugged them into my Ipod, the right speaker was much louder than the left, So I turned the cable back and forth at the bottom of the Ipod and the speakers snapped, popped and went out completely, then came back on. So you have to get the cord just right to have both speakers working. Don't bother with them, I cant believe ""Sony"" would make such a cheap pair of headphones. I'm going to have to get another pair."
3,Phones: Good Sound but Shoddy,"I bought two of these, happy to have found an over-the-head headphone with a volume control on the wire. Ear buds are always falling out of my ears.Well the sound quaity was very good, but after a tug on the wire when it got caught on the doorknob as I was going out the door, the right channel dropped out. Broken already! And it was not a hard tug. So I got my second pair, and the same thing happened in a week. It seems as if these headphones cannot withstand the slightest tug! When am I supposed to wear them? Only lying down, without moving? Two sets, dead in a month. Pity. I don't expect miracles for the good price, but they are for walking around, right?"
1,Not good,"In a week and a half, both sides of these are blown. Not a quality product. Should be able to handle my mp3 player's volume better than my $4 headphones, and even my $4 headphones arent blown yet!"
2,Broke too quickly,"I bought this pair in June and by September there is no sound coming from out of the right side. When they worked, they worked fine. Not anymore."
4,ghost,First time i heard this cd i kept repearting the tracks over and over. My favorite songs are do you believe and waiting for you but the other are great tracks too. if you are looking for rmusic to listen when you are relaxing this is the cd for you and it is defently worthy it.
5,Edgey Noir,"One of many, many noir films produced during this era, The Pay Off is a lot darker and more on the edge than most. As another unusual twist the main character is a reporter and not a private eye.This gives the production much less of the cookie cutter feel that you find in a lot of the mid level noir films and makes the ending more s urprising and less predictible than many similar films.There are no big stars, which enhances the uniquness of this production."
5,Lover of comedy,"This season and last season were outstandingly funny. I never had enough time to watch very many shows on TV, but the ones I did see I loved. Now I'm happy to own and see both seasons. Can't wait until the next comes out on DVD. Great gift for anyone. Great Price."
1,what a stupid show,"question, if SHE was a fat as him, yea she is tubby, but she is not FAT like him, and if HE was as cute as her, would this show make it past one year?Flat noWhat does that have to do with anything???never mind.Same goes for that Ask Jim showoh and George Constanza really got those kind of looking girls huh?um wonder why only in real life do these guys get these type of women if they have money? is it all ""chance""??No. but oh these shows are so Cuuuuuuute and funnyyyyyyyy.Some people are just weird, thats you people with high ratings on this show. strange strange world"
5,Kings of Queen (second sesson) (first sesson),"Love it!! Very good quality, no problem, perfect delivery"
2,Why does everybody like this video?,"I really don't know why this tape is rated that good. I couldn't really work out with it and it didn't help me in any way. I agree that the exercises are sometimes good ones, but it's soooo boring to repeat every movement 25 to 50 to 100 times, as recommended.I always had to stop the tape.I never felt refreshed afterwards, just tired- and it never had any effect on my waist. I think her method is only a cheap mixture of active stretching, isometric strenghtening and a bit of Pilates, but it would be better for everybody to really learn from Bob Anderson (""Stretching"")or from Pilates. And besides, I really hated this keyboard background music and all the pink stuff."
4,Great Toning,"This tape is great for abs and legs, although there isn't much of an upper body workout. Very intense, small exercises that really work. No cardio here."
4,Callanetics,"I am very pleased with the book, Callanetics. It is a great way to exercise, however, I think a DVD of the exercises is better because it would help do the exercises more effectively."
5,Callanetics is Awesome for your figure!!!!!,"I first used this tape when I was only 14 and now I'm 31 and anytime I want to get in shape quick, I come back to it. Sure its a little boring but you can always listen to music once you master the exercises. I did the exercises 3x a week and my husband took pictures of me every week during my use of the tape and the results were simply amazing. Stick with this tape for one month and you wont believe how your body changes!!!!"
5,Amazing stuff,"A friend lent me this video, and after 2 sessions, I had to have it myself! Some of the exercises are difficult at first (for the hip exercises, your leg really does feel ""nailed to the floor""), but as I got stronger, it became very easy, but I still knew I had quite a workout when I was done. And what a difference you'll see and feel! My size 13 jeans have since gone to the donation box, and I'm wearing a size 7!"
2,Disappointing,"This looked like it would be a terrific collection, but since receiving it: It's disappointing.The orchestra is lush. The forte piano sounds like a toy piano occasionally breaking into the lush, orchestra sound. So, let's say you are in the spa with the pump running and the spa stereo going. The orchestra sounds great. Suddenly you realize you can BARELY hear it anymore. You have to turn the volume up and there, softly, is the tink-tink-tink of the forte piano, which is massively overwhelmed whenever the orchestra kicks in.Now imagine NINE CDs with that going on. I can barely stand listening. If this sounds plausible, I highly recommend a recording set with a normal, modern piano. It might not be ""authentic,"" but at least it won't be massively disconcerting."
2,"Great Orchestra but bad ""mix"" with fortepiano","First of all the playing by all parties is impeccable. Nothing else to say about that. My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the volume/presence of the fortepiano is WAY TOO WEAK compared to the orchestra. It is virtually impossible to listen to this in the car for when the orchestra is at a comfortable volume the fortepiano is all but muted, and if you want to hear the fortepiano then the orchestra blows the speakers out. One may argue that one should listen to these with great attention with a real stereo system, but given that that isn't always possible (I drive 2-3 hours a day, and that's when I have a chance to feed my melomania) I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the sound mix of these otherwise technically superb CDs, especially given that it wasn't cheap. :)"
3,"""Working at the Factory,"" baby","Not the greatest Kinks album overall, but ""Working at the Factory"" is definitely one of my favorite songs these guys have done and one of the most biting looks at the music industry ever taken by a rock band. Worth it for this song alone, unless you want to buy the ""Lost and Found"" compilation instead, but then you miss out on other cool cuts like ""Repetition."""
3,On The Right Day,"Hit & miss Kinks. On the right day this album is a pleasure. On the other hand, it can come across as a waste of time. Certain cuts are worth a second listen, most notably Killing Time, the title track Think Visual and Lost and Found. Rock 'N' Roll Cities (sang by brother Dave) is awful. I'd rather sit in a small room filled with chalkboards and have 100 people drag their nails down them than listen to Rock 'N' Cities. It seems most Kinks fans agree with me on that point. Think Visual isn't a bad album, it just seems very uneven and hurried. Most of the songs (Working At The Factory, Welcome To Sleazy Town and Natural Gift) are very hit or miss. I consider this as one of the Kinks darker albums. On some of the softer songs, Ray sings with all the charm he has always delighted us with, and then you go to other songs and you're left scratching your head wondering what were they thinking? One word: uneven."
4,Great Reference Tool... Webdevs must have this!,"I was a raw beginner to ASP when I bought this book, I couldn't even read and write to a text file. This book covers starts at the very beginning with HTML and develops into scripting and then into ASP itself.It is an excellent reference tool. It covers the ASP Objects (Request, Response, Sessions, etc.) and succinctly covers the methods and properties by listing them in charts and exampling the fundamental use of the Objects using code samples.This book also covers CDONTS, which is an Object that can be used to send email via ASP code. CDONTS comes with IIS 4.0 or better. As well as several other optional Objects that ship with IIS.Want to connect to an Access Database? No problem, this book covers the ADODB Object and also covers rudimentary SQL to construct queries. There is also an Instant Reference available from the same author that is handy, when you don't want to lug around a big book!"
1,Absolutely inadequate translation,"I have been told by my Professor at the University of Cambridge that the French original of this book is marvellous. I believe him, for i detected gleams of superb narrative power and analytical insight in the mutilated English sentences that the translator torments the reader with. The translation has the cold, incongruent feel of a computer at work. The stylistic quality of the work is erased altogether, and the reader must pause and think over every sentence before he comes to fully realise the actual meaning of what he just read. I have read many a book in translation, and this is the worst one that i have come across. Unless you want your brain to be in severe pain, avoid it."
3,Will not work for double din radios!,"This arrived quickly and is of good quality. However, the item does not match what is shown in the picture. The one in the picture looks to be modifiable to a double din app. What showed up was a one piece unit that would be a great choice for a single din with pocket, but not for double din radios."
4,Outstanding book,"I'm about halfway through this right now and I'm telling you, Braver can write! From the first page I was hooked. Story and characters are believeable. I like that the story is character driven. The plot is easy to follow and not as technical as some of Crichton's more recent books. In fact I'd say that Braver NOW, is as Crichton USED to be. I find myself staying up MUCH too late to read. But Braver has a way of doing this. As with Elixir, Braver as centered his story in and around Boston. I'm looking forward to his next.--Chris"
5,A page-turner to the end!,"One of Braver's best. I was riveted from the very beginning. This book is particularly timely considering recent scandals in the pharmaceutical industry. How far will big business go to make a profit? How far will individuals go to spare their loved ones pain? The ethical quandries in this novel are many, and force you to think about what you would do. Excellent book!"
5,Wall St. vs. Medicine,"This is a very intriguing story, about corporate greed, and how the all mighty dollar comes first. This is stuff you read about in the paper, like ImClone Systems and Marta Stewart. Corporate folks engage in this type of conduct because it used to be tolerated. Braver is a master at capturing the feelings of those effected, developing characters and at the end, tells a powerful story. I enjoy his keen insight to the future of medical technology as well as his descriptions of New England. This is a must read."
2,I don't like it.,"The putty lost its firmness very quickly, plus the green coloring gets all over your hands. I wouldn't recommend this item."
3,These get the job done headphones,"These headphones keep the sweat out better than other similar athletic headphones. These are very affordable and the sound is OK, not great. Someone else mentioned that they are not durable and I support that. I have gone through 4 of these in a year. They tend to break at the joint. Before you buy check out Sennheiser PMX 70 Sport Earphones. I just bought these and I admit they are more expensive, but these have a single cord so the cord does not become twisted and they are made of a firm but flexable material. I have only run with them 2x they are comfortable although they do look a but weird."
3,mostly junk but still can be insightful. don't take it all to heart,"the overall tone of many of the essays was a self-righteous sense of humans being superior compared to any other creature on the earth because of our intelligence. while at the same time portraying a depressing outlook no matter what we do. i felt as if too often humans are being placed outside of the animal kingdom because of our higher functionality. the general tone of the compilation is that we are going to die and we can do nothing about it but ponder it and develop anxieties all through life and everything we feel or think is broken down to insignificance. too often i see the argument being between god or science. i really doubt the whole issue of brain science, evolution and spirituality are so black and white.."
3,Nice Gift,I think this was a cute gift. It is really shiny. Nice gift idea for a kid or someone who likes butterfly's.
1,returned item,Returned item as I felt it was poor quality and workmanship. Was of very light and not durable material that would not have lasted one week in the Midwest temperatures and climate changes.
1,Not what you paid for,"I bought three of these for Christmas gifts. I was very disappointed in the product.They look so pretty in the picture,but are really cheap.They are made out of plastic.Do not waste your money."
2,Needs belt clip instead of loop...,"The fit is tight and barely room for an extra battery. I love the camera but the case needs some work. Also, if Nikon is listening, I recommend adding a belt clip instead of the inconvenient belt loop."
1,"Poor quality, bad design","Device failed after a few uses. Not very powerful at all. Built in gauge is useless. No on/off switch. Save your money, blow your self."
1,waste of time and money!,Don't bother with this -- it's worthless and does not perform as described.
1,Worked for 30 seconds,"Unpacked the item, attached to 12 volt source and attempted to fill a tire. It ran for about a half minute before seizing up. That's what we get for buying cheap Chinese crap. Returned item for full refund."
2,snow rake,This product did not hold up.. the screws kept backing out.. I ended up re doing all the screws and putting in lock nuts to keep it together..to flimsey
5,Rake,Everything came in in great time and was packaged very well. The price on it was great also. Just as listed.
3,okay first time...but,"The roof rake went together easily and took the snow off the roof the first time I used it. The second time it came apart, one of the pieces went flying into three feet of snow to be found after the snow melts. Wish I had read previous reviews about the bolts and nuts. It's unwieldy and hard to lift - but I think that's the nature of a roof rake being handled by a 60 yr old weakling. Comes apart easily for storage."
4,Does the job!,"Got to use this a few times this winter for me it's the right length, 21 footer and does the job light and easy to handle from the ground."
5,Snow roof rake,"It worked grate, I used it to get the snow off the roof before it became to heavy and damaged the roof."
4,Fun and easy read,This was the first book I've read by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very witty and enjoyable characters and story line. Will be reading more of her books.
5,Interesting read,"Natalie has just moved to Notting Hill from Bath. She has a job at a clothing store, but that is about it. She just broke up with her long term boyfriend and has not lived in Notting Hill that long to meet anybody. The woman that used to live in her apartment is still getting calls and lots of mail which Natalie is told to hold incase Cressida comes back.One night when she was bored and drunk Natalie openes one of the letters for Cressida telling her about a guy she should call. Natalie does and she starts a relationship with Simon Rutherford. There is only one problem, he thinks she is called Cressida. Soon Natalie is in love with Simon and goes away with him to his parents house in the country where everything comes down on Natalie (or so she thinks)What happens next? Will Simon find out about Natlaies secret? Read Little White Lies"
2,Underdeveloped,"The story of this book sounded really promising and funny: Young woman moves to big city, works in retail, gets a bunch of mail addressed to the prior tenant and lies herself into a whole different identity.Unfortunately the way it was worked out was nothing else but disappointing. Without any warning, or any kind of explanation, the main character moved back to her hometown only to return to the big city and getting back with her ex-boyfriend within a few pages. It would have been nice to get some more insights and just some kind of how did she get there explanation. What ever happened to a gradual story development?All in a sudden she has her own store and lives happily ever after with the guy who thought she was someone else. How exactly did that happen? I feel I could have written this book better than this author.I like light and breezy novels, but that doesn't mean that they have to do completely dump and unrealistic."
2,Interesting Premise Tired of the Language,"Having read Molokai' and throughly enjoying it,I thought it would be interesting to read something else by the same author. Although the idea of ""what if"" crosses everyone's mind at one time or another, I tuned out quickly and found myself skipping lots of dialogue due to the amount of profanity. What could have been a great story was ruined by it's overuse."
4,"Thorough, though sometimes a bit too thorough...","I have found French for Reading a very thorough book. It appears to cover all points of grammar large or small, including not only formal grammar, but French-specific idiomatic uses of words and phrases. It also provides the reader with a cornucopia of examples for each grammatical point, which can become somewhat burdensome at times, especially for rather minor points. Overall, though, it is very helpful. Do not, though, expect it to have a very exhaustive concordance of French vocabulary in the back, because it does not."
5,Welcome back Gesar,"At last this wonderful and often cited rendition of the most famous parts of the Gesar epic is back in print! Buy it, read it, keep it. Its a gem."
1,Fuzzy!,"Bought these glasses for work where I have a lot of glare on my computer screen. Put them on and noticed two things: 1- everything was fuzzy, including the computer screen, and 2-the glare was just as bad a before, just now fuzzier. I regret buying them."
5,Jack Johnson Weekend at the Greek/Live in Japan double disc DVD,"I am more than satisfied with the product-- it offers performances from Jack Johnson with other artists (G. Love, Money Mark, ALO, etc.) and short interviews with Jack Johnson and band mates."
1,Damascene metal inlay demos,"This is the only source of which I'm aware on the fine art of precious metal inlay- also known as damascene. Unfortunately, disc one is flawed. The production quality is NOT good. Much of the DVD image is digitized, showing a pattern of various colored pixel patterns across the TV screen instead of Ray Cover and his very complicated inlay work. Also, the DVD would stop at numerous arbitrary places during the inlay demonstration thus interrupting ongoing instruction. While this may be true of ONLY the DVD I received, I'm not willing to risk another chance on reordering. Very disappointing! However, the distributer, Jim A., at ""Artisan Ideas"" was very nice and gave me a full refund."
1,no cc or english subtitles,"I have enjoyed watching ""Rosemary and Thyme"" on PBS and would love to purchase the series on DVD. However, although PBS broadcasts the show with cc, which I need, the DVD's do not contain the written word. This is extremely disappointing, since I cannot hear the words. Why would it not be included????"
5,One of my top ten,"Rosemary and Thyme series is one of my top ten favorite DVD sets. I return to it again and again; I never tire of it. Both of the lead actresses are their perfect for the character parts. They are believable, mature women, the kind that could live next door. Not the hard as brass tacks, every hair in place, Hollywood female leads preferred by so many other mystery/drama series. The series is well done, keeps your attention without all the in your face gore of so many other mystery series. This series has action, suspense, and drama while at the same time keeping it light, fun, charming and believable. I only wish they had made more episodes. The fact that the characters are both gardeners is the cherry on top."
4,Duel,"Duel is a classic movie about a car driver terrorized by a semi rig in the Arizona desert. KITT vs. Goliath on Knight Rider is similar. The Car is another similar movie. A car being chased by a semi rig that looks ""evil"" is what this movie is about. Watching this may make you think twice before angering a semi driver! It is made by someone named Steven Spielberg, you know, E. freakin' T.!"
2,"Sorry, pretty bad.","Like the other guy said, you might enjoy this movie if you are high.You can certainly see all the Spielberg crap in it's formative stages. His desire to create suspense at any cost, even if it means repeating essentially the same scene over and over, and drawing out scenes way beyond their logical end. His willingness to create situations and behaviors that have no basis in reality.This looks like a TV movie made by a talented teenager. You can't say I didn't warn you!"
2,I haven't laughed this hard late at night since....,"I haven't laughed this hard late at night since....well, I can't remember. I am shocked and appalled by the other reviews of this movie. Groundbreaking, sorry. Suspenseful, WHAT!? The movie has horrible acting, but i guess the script isn't that great either considering. The whole movie Duel is repetitive and nonsensical. About as nonsensiscal as WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE BIRDS AT THE END OF HITCHCOCK'S ""THE BIRDS""?????? But, I am straying from my point. The movie is fun to watch, I got a big kick out of it. Even to the point where I think I'll buy it and torture people that come to my house with it. YESSS YESSS YESSS!!!!!"
4,Superb Debut for Spielberg,"This is a great suspense thriller. Spielberg, with a script by Richard Matheson, were definitely influenced by Hitchcock(and no doubt some of Stephen King's work was influenced by ""Duel""). The concept of a motorist who starts a mundane day by passing a diesel truck only to be plunged into a surreal game of cat and mouse(or life and death) is priceless. Dennis Weaver gives an excellent performance as the motorist whose emotions range from befuddlement, to fear and paranoia, and finally steely determination in his effort to defeat the faceless menace. The production values, editing, and camerawork are great for a made for television film. I recommend this film with no qualifications."
3,first time only,i saw this movie plenty of years agoand recently got in the mood to order old movies i recall as goodit was ok the 2nd time aroundi guess the more realistic movies with more thriller action has made a once good film like this seem mediocrei would advise it if its ur first time
3,Inspiration for Joyride?,"After having just seen Joyride in theaters, I found this movie, and the plot sounds quite familiar, although in Duel it isn't known why the truck is chasing the car."
4,You think YOU've seen road rage?,"Not only a great debut film by our country's current filmmaker laureate Steven Spielberg, but a subtle cultural harbinger of the madness people can be driven to behind the wheel. Screenwriter Richard Matheson's (""I Am Legend,"" many classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes) output was so rich and varied during his lifetime, but ""Duel"" remains a career highlight. One star from perfection due to the 'in' early 1970s inner monologue and watered-down-for-television soundtrack (Who is Billy Goldenberg and why couldn't Johnny Williams have met Spielberg earlier to score this?), but ""Duel"" still taps into every driver's subconscious--and stays there forever. Anyone who feels like they just can't deal with their traffic 'nightmare' anymore should watch this. I've seen the movie at least once a year for the last 20 years (since I was five), and not only does it remain a personal favorite, but its indelible memory has helped me keep my cool--and my driving record clean."
1,Did not Work,"This Item did not work on my XM radio in my truck, still had engine noise come through the speakers."
1,not worth it,"It might of helped some, but not enough to buy and installInstalled on stereo amp had engine noise before I inatalled and after I installed it the noise was still there, maybe a bit less but not for sure"
1,Dime store quality,"When I got my Zip 100 USB Powered Value Series Drive it didn't look or feel like the quality I have come to expect from Iomega. After installing the software and the drive it looked like it was working. It detected just fine, but when I tried any of my disks it didn't recognize that there was any thing in the drive. I tried it on four other computers and several disks that I know work. I even tried a diferant USB cable.From now on I will steer clear of Iomega's ""Value Series"" products.PS: Kudos to Amazon.com. Returning it was delightfully easy."
1,Do not buy,I could never get the device to work. Technical support was no help. It still does not work and I wasted my money. Not a very good value
3,"Infuriating packaging, lightweight construction, but works","This drive comes secured inside of TWO thick plastic see-through blisters. The packaging is ludicrously hard to open even with scissors and a serrated knife, and environmental factors were obviously not a concern for Iomega. Disappointing. The drive works as advertised, with an easy-to-install software driver, a good set of updated Zip software tools, and idiot-proof USB plug-and-play compatibility with Windows machines and Macintoshes. I'm a tad concerned about the particularly flimsy construction; it's even a few shades worse than the other Zip drives I've owned, which weren't exactly bullet-proof themselves. If you need a (trans)portable Zip drive, well, they don't come any more lightweight and compact than this one, but I'd still go for something sturdier. On the other hand, if your Zip is just going to sit quietly on a corner of your desk, this is a pretty cost-effective storage solution."
3,Great idea but it is a bit unstable,Does what it states but tends to tip over a bit too easy unless you literally drill it into a wall. It has flipped on me a few times and my son's pee all over the floor so perhaps a better base would perfect it.
1,buyer beware,i was also very happy with the printer until i had to change the cartridge. all of a sudden the print quality declined and now it doesn't print at all. i've replaced all of the cartridges twice but to no use. i've read a bunch of similar reviews which lead me to believe that epson times their product life to perfectly coincide with the expiration date on the warranty. a waste of money!
1,Don't buy if you have a MAC,"I just bought this thing and I must say, it looks great. I'd like to be able to use it. All of the info about it, including that on the CD label, say that it can be used with the MAC OS 8.6 to 9x. It can also be used with MAC OS X and Windows, etc. I have OS 9.2 but I can't install the software because I get an error message that OSX is required. My email to tech support was returned with as ""undeliverable"" but the address used came from their book. I have called their tech support number (not an 800) and been on hold for over half an hour before giving up. I will have to either get OSX, or send it back. MJBE in DC"
4,Great for everyday use but not if you do much photo printing,"This is a great multifunction unit if you just need something for everyday use. Resolution is great, print speed is great and the value is wonderful for all of the features! However, the paper feeder is a bit loud and I do bunches of photo printing and could not get the color to come out right on this unit no matter how many different settings I tried. All my photos were either too dark or if I could get them light enough, they still seemed to have a smoky haze to them. Also, the user guide that is not included in the box but loaded onto your PC seems to be very vague in some areas. I bought the Canon I950 instead and love it! I wish this printer would have worked for the photo printing because I really liked the idea of the scanner/copier combo. But...this is not a photo printer although it has the capability to print photos and that is why it does not fit my needs. If all you want is to print, copy, and scan then this is your printer."
4,Printing is fine - copying needs improvement,"I just bought this product and only have one real concern for myself and a second that needs to be noted for anyone thinking about buying this product... the size did not bother me, neither did the noise... the problem? there is not document feeder when you are copying things.. you have to change each page manually... here I am copying, opening it up, putting the second page on, copying.. etc.. i dont know why there isn't an automatic feeder that I can drop all these papers into and come back when they are done...secondly - this does not copy or scan items that are larger than letter size... for those of you who need to copy legal size documents - this won't work for you..."
1,Peesacrap,"See the reviews for the Epson Stylus CX5400. Exactly the same problem here. I managed to force it to print the last time the cartridges were changed but this time it couldn't be done. When it worked it was beautiful, but I don't believe a printer's lifetime should be 3 ink changes. This is my 2nd Epson that I had a lot of trouble with- Lexmark isn't too much better, but my HP PSC750 is chugging along still after a little more than 5 years of service! And as a tech support person, I appreciate the HPs overall- much easier to maintain."
1,WASTE OF $$. STOPPED PRINTING ONCE I CHANGED CARTRIDGES.,Looks like I should have read the posts above before I bought an Epson. The printer is worthless. Only the scanner works. So now I have this big machine that only works as a scanner.
3,Great value but mediocre quality keyboard,"You get an excellent mouse with a decent keyboard. Considering the price of the mouse itself, this is a great value. However, I was not impressed with the quality of the keyboard. The keys feel cheap, and the action is unimpressive. For my taste, the keyboard is much too ""soft"" and feels flimsy. The optical mouse, however, is a must-have item. The precision of an optical laser is fantastic, and microsoft really does make the best optical mouse out there (although others are cheaper). The scroll wheel is extremeley useful, and the mouse feels great in your hand. If you need a keyboard and a mouse, this combo is a good value. But if you already have an acceptable keyboard, I would recommend buying the mouse alone."
4,Solid package,"After using the keyboard extensively, I can't say anything bad about it...it's a solid performer with no quirks or hassles. The mouse is a bit on the basic side, but for the price the two combined is not a bad deal at all.If you can afford to put down a little more cash, I would recommend the same keyboard with a Wireless Explorer mouse or even better the Logitech Freedom Pro Optical keyboard/mouse combo."
4,PRETTY GOOD BOOK,"""MICHAEL JACKSON: A VISUAL DOCUMENTARY"" BY ADRIAN GRANT IS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK AND VERY ENJOYABLE. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE TOUR DATES ARE INCORRECT, BUT I FORGIVE MR. GRANT FOR THIS. THIS BOOK PORTRAYED MICHAEL JACKSON IN A VERY POSITIVE LIGHT."
3,Decent for a beginner...,"I just completed this book and have a mixed bag of thoughts with regard to its usefulness. I am new to DirectX so the author's diligence in explaing DirectX topics definitely helped and his rather thorough explanation of the code was also useful. On the other hand, the code both in the book and on the companion CD is just riddled with mistakes! Chapter 13 is when you really start to dig into 3D techniques using vertex buffers, etc. and this is where the code problems really begin. Not only is the code in the book different than what is found on the companion CD, neither work properly. If you learn like I do, you key in all code and only use the companion CD when you cannot figure something out. If both code sources are wrong it is disappointing.Anyway, the book was probably a little pricey for what I got out of it, especially given the coding errors. Overall, it is an adequate learning tool for a beginner."
2,Chance Chance Chance,"Schroeder's book is well written, informative, seemingly objective and I can find very little in it to disagree with. However, at times, he seems to imply that chance is the sole operating mechanism in abiogenesis by using mathematics to illustrate evolution-by-chance-alone impossibility (by high improbability). The fact that ribozymes can catalyze RNA splicing is not due to chance. The fact that clay and other minerals can concentrate amino acids and other organic monomers is not due to chance. It occurs because the monomers bind to electrically charged areas on clay particles! There are chemical and physical laws at work in the universe as on early earth!To his credit he goes to a great length to show that life has a common ancestor. He understands the second law of thermodynamics (unlike most creationists), recognizes that life shares a common ancestor, admits that there were hominids existing before Adam, rejects biblical literalism, accepts the Big Bang, and the old earth."
1,Buyer beware!,"I bought this item for my wife and it worked wonderfully for a couple of months and then just stopped working completely. After going back and forth with DLO customer service about the problem, I was told that the arm between the Transpod and the cigarette lighter ""requires maintenance and needs to be replaced about every 6 months"" and ""is not defective, but does require maintenance"".If they know a part is going to fail every 6 months, that is a design flaw not something that requires maintenance. Also, if they know that the part will ""require maintenance"" every 6 months, why is that not disclosed on the packaging? I feel I was deceived into buying a defective product, and will never buy anything from DLO again."
1,NEVER BUYING FROM AMAZON AGAIN!,"I purchased this item and on Oct.30, 2006 I returned it becuase it looked like it was used. I purchased it under the understading that it was in a ""New"" condition. It was chiped in some places and overall it looked very cheap. It is Nov.20, 2006 and Amazon has not refunded me my money. Talk about BAD Customer Sercvice!"
3,Audio fidelity not great,"Overall, this works as advertised; however, the fidelity is average to below average- somewhere between AM and FM, and nowhere near CD-quality."
5,Great stories,"Best short stories I have read in a while-- I was pointed to Coake's collection after reading Nick Hornby's comment that ""when you're reading these stories, you forget to breathe..."" I had assumed this was merely typical reviewer hyperbole, but I found it to be literally true!"
2,Shame On the Editor,"I am relatively new to Java. Although I have forgotten most of what I once knew about regular expressions, I remember their power quite well. So I was very excited when I saw this book. But here's my unfortunate conclusion: The editing of this book is so sloppy, the typos so frequent and often grossly misleading, that what should have been a pleasure turned out to be a chore. Having said that, I will certainly admit that I got enough information to begin playing around with RE in Java myself. But I doubt I will ever buy another book from this publisher."
5,Excelent coverage of Java regular expressions.,"Before reading this book I was only aware of what regular expressions were used for. I had never used them in my own development. The syntax always looked so cryptic and intimidating that I never wanted to bother learning it. So, when I picked up this book at the store I never really expected to actually buy it. However, after flipping thru it for a short while I was convinced it was worth a try. I was not disapointed. The material is presented in such a clear and intutive manner that you find yourself learning without even trying. The examples are simple but apply to real world programming needs. After reading this book you will wonder how you ever got along without regular expressions. They are very powerful, and, now, easy to learn. Get this book!"
3,Wo is me :),"I thought this book would be more of a comparative rendering of the Buddhist perspective on the teachings of Jesus. I have not found that to be the case just yet.The introduction is very long. i'll persevere through it anyhow.....likely it is me anyhow and not the book,,,,,right?"
3,Nice but too tiny,"I am a Chinese student who studies in America and I bought this for my new Mahjong Club in my school. The case is not in good condition when I received it and the size of the mahjong is too tiny!!!! Also this costs too much. However, the quality of the Mahjong is fair and the Mahjong has indicators for Westerners."
3,Beginners beware,"Yes, I saw the title ... ""Chinese Mah Jong...."", but being a newcomer to the game, I assumed all Mah jong was Chinese. Got a book to go with it. Turned out to be for ""American Mah Jong"" which can't be played with this set of tiles. Still can't try playing the game because the directions that came in this box of tiles were not clear (written by Chinese and not translated very well). We're getting a book on how to play the Chinese version. The tiles are very nice quality and I look forward to learning Chinese Mah Jong."
3,"Durable, but not much interest here",We got this toy with about 10 others between Amazon and Petco and this is the toy our dog (9 month English Springer Spaniel) plays with the least. It is however durable and if he were to use it I think it would stand up to his constant chewing. Overall based on the product itself I would recommend buying it.
2,Not as durable as advertised,"This might be fine for less strong chewers, but my 45 lb. Chinook/American Staffy mix ripped pieces off in the first use (with a bully stick shoved through the middle); I had to throw it away.I purchased it along with the Petsafe Busy Buddy Squirrel Dude: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A61GNO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01The Squirrel (filled with freeze dried duck pieces) kept him busy for a couple of hours and has no signs of damage. I'm buying another one of those for when his friends come over."
3,Good,A little heavy my lab will play for it for awhile then drop it on the floor. She does play with it not one of those toys she never plays with at all.
2,Not for a heavy Chewer,"I have what you call an extreme Brittany. He is young and chews heavily. The first time I gave this to him with a treat in it he ripped out big chunks. If you have an agressive chewing dog, get an extreme Kong. At least they last a few months before Jake chews through them."
5,Great Product!!!,"This is one amazing product. This is compatible with any wireless network, and it is the most powerful. I used to have the linksys wireless pc card, but the smc card is much better then any pc card I have ever used. There is no card that works better then this. The software is very easy to setup. I recommend this product for use. I am using Windows XP, and my smc card communicates with a linksys access point and I get speeds up to 11Mbs when I transfer files between my desktop and laptop. I hope this review is helpful"
1,Not XP Compatible,"I have the smc2632w installed in a brand new Dell notebook running windows xp with all the latest drivers. I had done a clean install. Card very frequently starts blinking and locks up the computer. If I close the case to force it into sleep mode, wait until the light on the card goes off, then open the case up and bring it out of sleep mode, I can bring it back grom the dead, but it takes several moments, and any downloads, etc., at lost. Called SMC, and they said it was a known problem with the card and drivers especially with XP. When I asked why this compatibility issue wasn't mentioned on their website, the tech support guy basically said ""well, what do you expect for under [dollar amount]???"""
2,Poor Signal Strength and Rarely Synced with Linksys,"I have a Linksys Wireless Network Access Point. I rarely got the SMC to lock. When it does lock, it does not stay in sync for more than 20 minutes before losing the connection. It has a range of about 15 feet in the same room and about 10 if you go behind a wall.My D-Link card worked flawlessly under the same conditions. I would not recommend it and will likely return it."
4,Gets warm and keeps on working,"Purchased this card, SMC's USB network adapter and access point at the same time. The card works with either laptop. Had to download newer version of firmware and monitoring software prior to installing. Card works very good. The SMC USB network adapter gets better connection but would be difficult to manage while on the patio snacking and cruising the net. The card gets warm during use. Do not know if this is completely normal of wireless PCMCIA cards. There have been no problems with this card. I would recommend the USB one if you do not move your laptop around alot."
1,terrible reception,i own this card and the reception is horrible. i had to purchase a 3com card to replace it.works fine if your access point is very close but i would just recommend going with something like 3com for just a few bucks more.
2,"Great works, but the other set is FAR better!","I must warn you! Metzmacher is a weak, tentative, and cautious conductor, intent on keeping everything in perfect balance with all the rage and pain under control - everything ""tasteful."" In Hartmann!!! The resulting performances will have you screaming at the speakers in frustration if you are familiar with the much more powerful and wildly passionate renditions in the Wergo set. In comparison to Macal, Leitner, and Kubelik, Metzmacher is pale and tepid. Since these, along with those of Havergal Brian, are among the very greatest of the 20th century symphonies, one might not realize what was missing without having heard the Wergo set. But, believe me, it's worth the extra dollars to find out!"
3,Misleading ?,"The Amazon title is : Chopin : Polonaises ; Andanta spianato ; Minor Works. By Marta Argerich....By Marta Argerich ? Not do fast. When looking further down, one discovers that she plays only two minor pieces. The Polonaises are played by Pollini, and the rest by Anatol Ugorski. An honest mistake,I am sure, but it looks uncomfortably like bait and switch."
1,Headphone exploded,"I bought this item in December 2010. To be honest, it has worked very well for two years until a few days ago (Feb. 2013) it exploded outside of my ear. No serious injury, but I was scared."
2,Visions of Making a Little Bit of France Boring,"While the other ""Visions of Europe"" made me want to rush out and buy a plane ticket, this is a Vision of France noone would care to visit. I can't help but wonder if this was the producers intent. Here, a beautiful country is reduced to a few minutes of the Cote de Azure followed by endless repeats of what looked to be the same set of small nameless hilltops in Provence. This is not France - it is a ridiculous waste of time and helicopter fuel. Don't put yourself through it."
1,Modernized Early Music,"The tenor voice, lute, baroque violin and double-bass were a lovely sound which on their own would have made this an excellent CD. This is demonstrated in the sections of Come Again where the John Surman is not playing. When either of the two reed instruments is added, the balance overpowers the tenor soloist and the reeds have a poor tone quality, often to the point of allowing the reed to emit a distracting buzz.From a historical perspective, they take too many liberties with the form and style of the pieces. The improvization done was totally out of character for the period.I was very dissapointed with this CD, and the problems made it difficult to listen to the entire CD. If you enjoy PURE early music, do not buy this CD."
3,Okay,"Its good in the form of detail, but the opinion of the author comes through too much. She dwells to much on her own life during the trial and the other jury members, then the trial itself. If you enjoy learning about criminal law, its a must. If looking for a book on the Menendez case and trial, read 'Blood Brothers'."
2,"Very outdated, dont buy this ! buy TAKE OFF IN RUSSIAN","I just bought it based on so many favourable reviews and it is very out-dated, almost obsolete. Who is going to ask in a dialogue with a friend: ""For whom are you sending your son""?? ""behind whom is the dog running""? Maybe the dog is after who wrote this book! You better buy ""Take off in Russian "" ,it comes with 4 cds and a downloadable MP3 and for less than 30 bucks at Amazon."
2,Too much trouble,"That Cyrillic alphabet is a bear. Now I am finding that most of the things I want to read have been transliterated, using English letters. This makes it easier to read, but I should have also bought a dictionary. At the moment I am at a stand-still with this project and don't have the time necessary to devote to it."
5,Very good- brand new and helps me a lot!,Ordered this because I took a semester of Russian Language/history last year and my boyfriend and his family are from Azerbaijan and speak Russian. I find it very helpful and goes at a good pace for someone who has had little experience or none. Not too bad of a price either. I'd definitely recommend.
1,Extremists,Are you seriously kidding me? At no point in joining a fraternity do they make you worship the devil or anything of the like. Frederic Hatchett is an extremist who is afraid to think for himself.This book is down right awful.
1,Buyer Beware,"This product does not work currently under Windows XP, even though the SMC website clearly claims that ALL shipping SMC products have been tested with XP. Tech support does not respond to inquires about this issue. STAY AWAY!"
4,Easy way to get a PC onto a home LAN to share internet,"I bought the USB adapter with a SMC7004AWBR Access Point/Router and another PCMCIA card. The system works well. USB PC is on the forst floor and the Access Point is on the second floor. I have one PC where the USB adapter drivers do not always load correctly, another that works plug and play every time. I'm very happy with this system."
2,Toms worth watching,Kinda has the feel of a home movie of you and your buddies on a surf trip. Not the best surfers but Toms always fun to watch and Tudor is good in the last section. Lots of Bruce Brown cornball stuff but still worth a rental for sure.
3,Could be better,"The Picture could be sharper and you need the remote controll to do many of the controlls. Will play back-up dvd's on all brand of dvd's. One word of advise do not buy if there is a rebate, Amazon will do nothing to help you collect and it been 3 months and no rebate, customer service says your on your own."
3,ITS OK,"The spray works fine, But the straws they give you doesn't work. FIRST it doesn't fit, Second IF IT Does fit, then it leaks., But THE SPRAY WORKS FINE!"
1,"Weak, and coming from van de Wetering, sad","Van de Wetering had created a couple of human and clever detectives. In this novel, things go astray. Grijprtra is getting old and sour, De Gier is turning into a silly mistycist (although van de Wetering loves and protects him). Some dialogues are completely unbelievable, the resolution of the murder comes out of the blue, and the drum and flute duets are gone. Only the commisaris retains part of his charm. I think I will re-read ""Death of a hawker"" and cry."
1,Nothing of value here I'm afraid....,"No need wasting time reading this bore, or should I say waisting time reading this boar ??? For Rosie to have thrown away her happiness for this ??? Foolish at best, sad at worst! Even Sarah could have done better !!!"
5,Authentic Power Book on CD,"I have to say that I did not get through the first CD. These sort books on CD, regardless of author, lose a bit in comparison to live seminars, but having said that, this was really borish. The material is probably good stuff, but I just could not hang with Mr. Zukav's reading tone. So, I gave it to a friend who is a big Zukav fan. I hope she enjoys it."
2,Disappointing...,"If you've read the author's Seat of the Soul, which is an excellent book, you won't learn anything new."
3,This is simply a radio program w/ Zukov as a speaker.,"This audio tape is from the great New Dimensions radio series, but sadly it isn't as packed full of goodness and new thought as other broadcasts. Rather innocently, I think, Zukov doesn't directly answer several key questions, and bypasses a couple of ones that could have provided meaningful answers. The title promises MUCH MORE than it presents. Also (Amazon folks please note) it is listed as a $16.98 value...but right on the box is printed $10.98. Iexpected more value than what it ended up being."
4,Gardiner's Ghosts,"A fascinating look at paranormal happenings in York, England. Amazing footage of ""ghosthunters"" as they explore the ghostly history of this medieval village. The original score is great and definitely enhances the mood of the documentary. A must see for anyone interested in the occult."
3,good start,"This was Crystal's first album. Since this was under MCA, Crystal was looked at as Loretta's little sister. This shows through especially in the song Lynn penned Donna Fargo like song ""Sparklin' Look of Love."" It doesn't fit Crystal but she sings it with spunk anyway. Other than the two big hits this album made (Everyone Oughta Cry and the good sapper I've Cried the Blue Right Out of my Eyes) Clock on the Wall is another stand out."
5,hitachi replacement battery EB1820,"After searching for a replacement battery that would fit the 18V Hitachi reciprocating saw and skill saw, we had almost given up. The set was 5 years old and has since been redesigned where the new batteries did not fit. We were so happy when we received the new battery shipment, that we ordered another one right away. It is great to find what you need on AMAZON, service is excellent, fast and affordable."
5,"Great Lyrics, Beautiful Sound","I recently had the privilege of hearing Sarah Kelly's music for the first time. What a treat!I picked up this CD and have listened to it numerous times since then. She has a unique and delightful sound. Her songs are all focused on praising the Creator of the Universe.If you haven't heard her before, I would highly recommend this CD. There are no bad songs on this record. My personal favorites are: 'Take Me Away', 'Forever', and 'Matter Of Time'.Buy it and enjoy!"
4,huge! perfect for crafts,"i bought this bag to use for my pottery tools. it is huge! and kind of heavy. but i love all of the pockets. i'd recommend this bag to anyone who needs a ""portable studio."""
5,very good,I remember seeing this movie when it came out and was impressed then . I got this dvd copy and I am impressed now . I can remember reading about the battle of Waterloo and this movies follows the event very closely . You believe that Rod Steiger is Napolean . Why can the major studio issue the dvd instead of the other country .
5,Purchased for reference,I purchased this book to use it as a reference. The information I have look for has been available and very helpful
3,"Good, but Hardly and Encyclopedia","I have a number of books on Tropical and Marine fish and am always on the lookout to add to my collection. However I am always wary of books with Encyclopedia in the title. The subject if tropical fish and fish-keeping is vast and a book that covers every part of it would cost a fortune and probably break the table it rested on.It is a nice enough book and with it by your side you should be able, not only to keep your fish alive but see them thrive. It gives the more common food that is available and these days that is a great deal of food. What to do if your fish become ill and also a little about the habits of different fish."
5,Best SciFi Film Ever,"One of the first SciFi films I remember seeing as I grew up inthe 1950's. James Whitmor and James Arness (Matt Dillion) begantheir careers with this production. Thank God for DVD's, I havebeen able to reactivate my memories of black and white movies andearly TV. Only ""ALIEN"" has equalled the suspense and horror of theSciFi genre."
3,Not bad,"""THEM!"" is not like most giant monster movies. It has more substace to it than any Godzila movies. Maybe that's because ""THEM!"" actually has a plot. The oly real problem is that the special effects are mainly puppets projected on screens behind actors, and extremely fake blowtorches. If you like puppet shows, this movie might appeal to you. ...Bottom Line: The plot does not make up for the horrible acting and effects."
4,PLEASED!!,"I am very pleased I received it as instructed, but the case has a cut slit in it. I don't mind this so much as long as the DVD is okay."
2,The DVD still gets 2 stars because the film deserves 5,"I already had this movie on VHS and on Beta.I bought the DVD to get the""BEHIND -THE-SCENES ARCHIVE FOOTAGE MONTAGE ON THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF GIANT ANTS.Either they forgot to include it, as well as, the theatrical trailer and cast film highlights, or the interactive menus on this DVD are so bad it's impossible to access any of the special features besides scene selection and subtitles.And it's not that easy to get the last two to function either.Addendum to the above review:Although I wasted hours trying to access the footage I mentioned above, it is there.If you are trying to view it on a computer , use the arrow and enter keys on the keyboard for access.Watch for changes in the text in the lower left panel.I still have had no luck using the mouse to get to that part of the content."
5,Classic,"I saw this movie for the first time in 1983. I loved it then & it's still a great flick. Classic sci-fi / horror. Only problem is, this dvd has no audio."
4,Them on DVD,This is a great classic Si-Fi flik.A must have for Si-Fi fans around the world.I feel that even non-Si-Fi fans will really fnjoy this classic aswell.
1,truely a bad product one of the biggest fales advertisments yet !,BLACK MAGIC NO SCRUB WHEEL CLEANER ! THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK ! IS NOT AS DESCRIBED ! AND AFTER USING IT I HAD TO USE ANOTHER PRODUCT TO GET THE JOB DONE ! I WOULDNT EVEN RATE IT AS ONE STAR BUT I HAD TO PUT SOMETHING. HOW CAN THEY EVEN SELL THIS PRODUCT !
2,Just in case...,Three reviews already written about this book and they are all 5 stars. Interesting. I guess a few others loved it and maybe a few might not. I'm one of the latter few. I really hoped I'd like this book but for some reason after reading 100 pages I still wasn't getting into it. I was bored by it.It may not be fair I wrote a 'review' afetr not finishing it but I think some people might like to know that not everyone likes this book so far.
5,Entertaining.,While some of what Vince Vaughn does/says in this movie has been seen/heard in his previous movies...the movie is entertaining and fun to watch with your family.
5,Love the movie,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really enjoyed the price that I paid for the movie also.
3,Slow movie,Rented this on VOD for 99 cents. It was very slow and we almost turned it off. It did get better in about the last 25 minutes but I sure would not recommend it.
3,An Average Christmas Comedy,"Fred Claus, the heretofore unknown brother of Santa Claus is the subject of this entirely average holiday film. This film is better than last year's horribleDeck the Halls, but not even close to the holiday [now] classicElf (Infinifilm Edition). The best parts of this movie are the very enjoyable stars including of course Vince Vaughn, who is very funny on screen, and Paul Giamatti. There are several nice little messages in the film, but there really is not any new ground covered here. I think this is a three star movie that is enjoyable for family viewing, especially the younger viewers."
2,On a TiVoHD...,"I downloaded this on my TiVoHD:1. Was letterbox, not widescreen. :-(2. Quality seemed OK though - like DVD, not Blu-Ray.3. It was nice to be able to use the TiVo back and forward buttons.4. The regular price is too much, especially for only a 24 hour rental.5. The 24 hours limit should be at least 3 days or 5 days.6. I prefer Netflix. No worrying about watching it before it's deleted.7. Because of the lousy 24 hour limit, my wife had to attend to our child and did not get to finish the movie.8. Fred Clause wasn't as good as Elf."
2,Kinda Pointless,"I love Christmas movies that don't mention Jesus one time during the whole thing. it's fascinating. But that's not what makes this a mediocre movie. Nah, the truth is that it makes you wonder why Fred doesn't just live in Saudi Arabia or at least just hang out with the jews during christmas time."
4,Good Christmas Movie,"Overall a good movie. Not an all-time great, but fun to watch. I would recommend to those that haven't seen it."
3,Fred Claus,"May become a classic, but doubt it. This is the other side of Santa Claus and his family. It was cute and funny."
5,A good family movie.,This is a good family movie which can be enjoyed by all age groups. I intend to put it away until the next Christmas season since the grandchildren enjoyed watching it over and over.
3,Your opinion of this movie rides on your opinion of Vince Vaughn,"This movie has a lot going for it. The cast is great, with Paul Giamatti, Elizabeth Banks, Kathy Bates, Kevin Spacey and Rachel Weisz. Most of the movie is spent at the elaborate north pole set, which should be captivating to kids. There is even a touching, stereotypical tame Christmas plot.But the key is, do you like Vince Vaughn. Vaughn is the star and plays Fred Claus, Santa's older, underachieving brother. Vaughn plays Fred as he has every other character (without the swearing or low brow humor.) He is a fast talking, wise cracking loser who gets a second chance. If you don't mind Vince Vaughn's schtick, then you'll enjoy this film."
3,Fred Claus,"`Fred Claus' is one of those Christmas films that surprises you by being better than you expected. This follows Fred Claus, who is Santa's older, jaded brother, who has to help save Christmas when Santa injures himself. There is family history and some animosity between them, but this is put aside in the name of Christmas.Vaughn has some funny lines and really makes this film with his comedic acting and Giamatti plays Santa very well indeed. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well and this film manages to be heart warming, without being schmaltzy; which is rare for a Hollywood film these days.This is easy going, not too taxing, has a reasonable storyline and makes for an entertaining couple of hours viewing for all the family. Exactly what you would wish for in a Christmas film.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Barely 2 Stars,"This is a Christmas film with many messages.For example......a single woman with a child will be happier than a single woman who has a child and a man in her life...a single woman and a single man living together is preferable to the two getting married to each other...there is no such thing as naughty or nice. A child should be rewarded no matter what they do. If we feel they have done something wrong, then this is our own hangup. A child has a good reason to lie or steal. We just need to find out what that reason is....Christ is not a part of Christmas. In the film, there is a beautiful rendition of the Christmas carol, ""Silent Night."" However, one line from the song is cut. Can you guess which line? Yes, that's right...""Christ, the Savior is born. Christ, the Savior is born.""The only reasons I gave this film two stars were for the script and the acting."
3,Give and take,"If you like to customize your Civ games with custom maps, then this expansion offers lots of great new terrain for you to work with. Plain and simple, that is the only reason I got it. There are a few additional tweeks like scenerio building and some new units, but that's it.If you plan on getting this game for multiplayer, then skip it, because it was like an after thought.For anyone running PTW or just Civ3 on older systems, stick to smaller maps if you want the game to run faster. Newer systems do fine and I have to agree with another reviewer, if you are experiencing lag, then your machine needs upgrading. I have only experienced lag on the huge maps and not anything really annoying either. I'm running the game on a AMD 1 ghz machine.As for lots of patches, there has only been 2 for Civ3 and one for PTW which mainly deals with multiplayer, which once again, is not really worth it. Releasing 3 patches is nothing compared to some other games."
1,And it's for multiplayer?,"I got this so I could play the game with my son on my LAN. Even though I have many multiplayer games working fine on my LAN, this one still doesn't work. They say they support WinXP and Win98SE, but I don't think they support if one PC is WinXP and one is Win98SE, (like my setup).Their support suggested opening ports, but that's really just for Internet games, not LAN. Failing that, they blamed it on Microsoft. Adding insult to injury, you actually have to buy a separate CD for each PC even though it is a LAN game. Most games don't require this for LAN games; sure for Internet, but not LAN."
1,DVD was either defective or empty,"I received this DVD and confess that I didn't try to play it for a few months. Once I put it in the DVD player I found out that the DVD was either defective or empty. I put a different DVD in the player and it played just fine, so it is not the player that is defective. When I put this DVD nothing came up and we tried a few times."
1,Absolutly disgraceful...,"When i saw the androids of tara i was mainly laughing at the site of so call ""bad guy"" count grendals nose. K9s appearance was brilliant the chess game at the beggining was a laugh. The story was a DOCTOR WHO fairytale and least favourite in the key to time series. All in all rubbish."
4,International DVD,"Because Australia & US have different standards for TV (PAL vs NSTC), there was some doubt about compatibility of DVDs. But the product arrived promptly & worked fine on an Australian DVD player"
5,Cool & Refreshing.,"Alex Gopher, the French artists, does it again: He sampled Billie Holiday and created a cool tune. I recomend it. You won't be sorry!"
4,V: The Final Battle (Are You Missing Out),V:The Final Battle is a great movie but i think they needed to keep creater Kenny C John on board. He is the one that started it all and should of been there for the Final Battle and TV Series. V:The Original Miniseries and the V: Final Battle andV: The Complete Tv Series are all my Favorite. You all that don't have it. You Don't know what you are missing. Thank You.
2,"I grow up with this, men !!!","When the Region 2 Version DVD for Europe ?Galactica and V Series, such like Buck Rogers (Space1999), Knight Rider or A-team, belongs to an all 80's generation. I live in the border between Spain and Portugal, and I saw all these Series in both countries. Why didn't sell this DVD Series in Europe ? I think that will be ( i'm sure ), a bestseller."
2,The book from hell.,"Asides from hating the class that I have to have this book for, I was thoroughly unsatisfied with my product. I did not see anywhere that there was a supposed stain on it and now I don't think that I'm going to be able to resell the dang thing. I was very upset when I received it."
4,Buenos Consejos para realizar la estimulación prenatal.,"Compre este libro pensando en que me ayudaría a darme una idea mejor que como llevar a cabo la estimulacion prenatal, el libro al principio es un poco repetitivo pero conforme se va avanzando da buenos consejos y muchos tips para realizar la estimulacion prenatal."
2,Disappointing,"When I first bought this DVD, I did not know what to expect. I had read some favorable reviews of Philip Gardiner that prompted me to explore his work. This DVD was a disappointment! There was a lot of non-sense music which had little if anything to do with the subjet matter. Many assertions were made, but no justification or sources were cited. The content had little point with the title. In my opinion, if you are going to trash a worldwide accepted institution you need to be armed with the facts, and be able to communicate the sources. He failed miserably in this respect. There were pictures displayed that had nothing to do with the dialogue or were out of context. This DVD was not very scholarly or professionally produced. Wait until it goes on sale below $10..."
5,Fine coverage for a modest price.,"Over 2,000 patches and tabs are represented in this remarkably comprehensive guide. From World War I to the present, not only the Army (with a fine selection of pocket and unofficial patches), but also Army Air forces and Aviation, Navy, Marine Corps, Civil Air Patrol, and National Guard are logically organized, illustrated in full color, and identified with checkoff boxes for the collector.The excellent production values, generous coverage, illustrated essay on patch construction, guide to correct wear, handy table of contents, glossary, World War II organizational chart, and other useful features make this possibly the best patch guide available today, and certainly the most for the modest price. Highly recommended for the collector, WWII buff, and student of military history. (Also available in softcover.)(The ""score"" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not ""score"" books.)"
2,Where is the Coast Guard?,"Have not read the book but as for the title another author forgets about the 5th armed service - the United States Coast Guard - which has been involved in every major conflict. In fact, during WWII most landing craft were piloted by Coasties. Funny that they rate the CAP as a military service per the title. I'll give it a couple stars as I'm sure it does a fine job of showing other service patches."
2,Over-rehearsed and over-calculated readings,"I was greatly looking forward to enjoying the Amadeus set but it turns out that they don't live up to the Greatness of emotion or spiritual depths of Beethoven's Quartets.I have to agree with the other reviewer about these readings being lacking in warmth and being overly calculated. Almost all the time it seems the Amadeus performances are over-rehearsed and for me that is a huge turn off! No doubt they play technically immaculate and intensely but to me that matters less than ""What"" these pieces are about.I also don't mind the 1960's DG sound, it is fresh, clear and loud, a bit on the dry side but not as dry and parched as the Talich cycle!Try the Lindsay's cycle or the Vegh's for what I'm talking about when it comes to emotion, passion and spiritual qualities."
4,doctor who the power of kroll,the item arrived on time and was viewable...that's most important...i am pleased to have this item in my library now and would purchase more items from this seller especially if they are doctor who films
2,"Resoundingly awful, but intriguing like an Ed Wood film.","Funny how this episode raises so much like and dislike. Nothing in this episode, however bad, can compare to the candy coated amaturism of the late eighties Doctor Who because Douglas Adams always wrote the best one liners in the show during his stay as script editor. Large rubber tentacles, green stupid aboriginess, an oil rig on a swamp planet and wandering adventures without proper focus....thats all I saw. I agree with the earlier reviewer who said this would be extremely entertaining if it weren't so boring."
5,Finally quality video for photography,I have reviewed literally dozens of photography videos and surprisingly most of them have very poor video quality. But this title finally has video quality to match the quality of the photography. The on location feel is fantastic. It combines great advice with the feeling that you are on a real photography excursion. It is shot in the Smokey Mountains but the topics apply to all outdoor photography. The in studio sections are equally well done. This is the best of the videos out there and I hope Tony does some more. His books are also a great companion to the video.
1,Leave it Alone,"Anaconda was a ground breaking film in terms of Special Effects. Anacondas was a Theatrical flop yet rained in decent profits. Anaconda 3 SUCKS. and now SciFi is Making a Anaconda 4 or Anaconda 3.5. Picking up right after the third.I am a great fan of the Anaconda films, first and second that is. How sci-fi got the rights to continue the series is beyond me. I like SciFi but lets face it, there movies arnt top Knotch, there REALLY REALLY CORNEY. Not a good Combo for a CGI Exciting Enterprise.SciFi's Version, Anacondas 3: The Offering. is a disaster. First the CGI. all i have to say is SciFi Channel Effects. Not Good. Second, the Story. Plain Boring. (1)Snake Captures, (2)Snake Escsapes, (3)Snake Eats People, (4)SpecOps Kills Snake. Does SciFi ever use the Regular Army? Anyway, its a real dispappointment even compared to the Contriversal Original Sequal. and now there planning a Fourth! NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
1,"Boring, Negative Book","I found this book to have a very negative and complaining tone to it. It was not what I expected. Rather than celebrate having a son it seemed to find writers that wanted a girl and ended up with a boy, or their boy was a bully or some other negative story. Not worth your precious time."
2,Ultimate Time Waster,"The graphics on this game are horrible. It freezes up constantly, and the deer look like dogs with big ears when you see them from a distance.Cabela's you really disappointed with this one"
5,The best book ever on hard to find prehistoric cats!!!!!!!!!,I never expected the book would be such an impressive accumulation of information and pictures. Everything about this book was done with such detail that nothing I've see so far compares to it. The pictures depict not just the details of each prehistoric cat (and the marsupial convergent evolution 'versions') but presents them in scale to the present and extinct cats to give us an clear idea of the size of these animals. Both author and artist have to do a sequel now that a new sabertooth species was just found in Florida.
5,Monster Jam Rules!,"This was for my son on his 7th b-day! He had a total Monster Jam birthday. I was very happy to find this video on Amazon. Great service, very fast. He loves it & we watch the video all the time now."
3,"looks great, doesn't last","My daughter loved this pen, and took good care of it, but it didn't last long, if you switch colors at all it comes apart and the knob to swith colors broke right away, so bummed, because my daughter was so excited about it."
1,Nearly one-third of HP discs are flawed and won't burn,"Avoid any HP discs like the plague. I bought 3 spindles of these disc thinking I was getting a good deal. I'm not exaggerating - nearly 1/3 of the discs fail as the data approaches the outer track. There are visible flaws in the recordable media around the outside edge that indicate some kind of process flaw during the disc pressing. I've seen several discs freshly lifted off of the spindle that have circular etching marks inside the transparent coating that follow portions of an outside track. When you try to record these - they fail precisely where these etch marks occur. I've had similar result in ALL three of the spindles that I purchased. HP used to be synonymous with quality; but those days are long gone. You'll have much better results with the much cheaper and much more reliable ""Amazon Basic"" DVD+R and DVD-R discs.AmazonBasics 4.7 GB 16x DVD+R - 100 Pack Spindle"
3,Another opinion!,"This set replaced a Surefit set that I had used for many years, even dyed them another color with no problems. This new set did not have quite the ease of material that the old set had . No matter how I try to fit this set on my sofa and loveseat the material is just short in the arm areas and it is hard to cover the original material underneath. I do suggest that with the down turn of the economy Surefit must be trying to cut cost by cutting the amount of mateial used. Not a good thing to do!I have also noticed that their selection of non-stretch covers seem to be getting smaller and almost the same colors are offered just in different materials. What is the use of that? While I like Surefit products their whole product line seems to have suffered in color and style. Why don't they offer options that you can mix and match for a new style look. I think they need to review their material, texture selections and stop cutting the fabric short. But, hey, no one asked me about that."
2,Tedious Detail,"This book has endless details rergarding geneologies and the habits of ancient sailors? . Too Much useless information...boring.Little or no information on the early days @ Apple Records.A fantastic artist relegated to the accounts of textile workers "" Waulking""?give me a break!!"
3,Long overdue look of Kerouac in Florida,Although the book has major shortcomings--foremost a real stretch to actually form a book and not a lengthy article--Kerouac's time in Florida is finally revealed. A sad tortuous hell of an existence in the state--just what the reader expects.
4,A unique experience,"This is essentially the nonfictional journal of a man as he journeys through fuedal Japan, as he logs his experiences, and writes haikus. It is both fascinating and sometimes confusing trying to decipher what he is experiencing. I don't believe that this is the best translation in existance, but for various reasons it is difficult to capture a translation from this era because some of the traditions and symbolism is lost, as described in the book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
5,great product,Perfect for the job will order another to have as a spare. very well build any one in the industry should have one of these
2,Too little too much,"Good quality product, the real issue is that there isn't enough tint to do more than one full size automotive window (side) and not much more, maybe a wing window."
4,"Short, but well characterized.","It didn't take me long to read your book. As short as it was, I found it amazing that I could vividly picture each of the characters. A Cher-type definitely fits the motorcycle mama. Ranger Sue has short hair and is athletically built. I can't make up my mind whether Pierce Brosnin or Mel Gibson should play Blackhawk. Matt Damon is Jay. Congratulations."
5,Old Skool ICP,"This is ICP at their best. Better than any of the crap they been producing lately (bar Hell's Pit). This is a must for any ICP fans, but also a must for fans of good old skool rap. Coz this is really good. Starts off with Beverley Kills, which is a great start to this EP, great beat at the start, not my favorite though. Next is 17 Dead, which is one of my favorites, awesome beat, and lyrics are dope as hell. Best song here has to be Chop! Chop!, which features Esham. Beat is AWESOME, and all rappers here are right on the target. And with Esham producing and being in it, it's guaranteed to be a gem. Other great tracks are Joke Ya Mind, and The Stalker. Get this even if you're not a fan of ICP, because this isn't like any of the garbage you may have heard, its AWESOME."
3,A Classic That Deserves More,"This EP release receives one of my lowest ICP ratings only because I hate EP's...too short for too much moolah. But you can't ignore the classic ""The Stalker"", and the hilarious ""In the Haughhh!"". And ""Joke Ya Mind"" is definately an eye-opener. A solid release for Juggalo's only."
4,The Demon Child trilogy,"Excellent read, extremely hard to put down, leaves you wanting to start the next book immeadiately!Ms. Fallon needs to keep writing! Her characters continue on like the great charachters of Ludlum or Clancy!Timothy Leary"
2,Disappointing,I was quite disappointed with the performance of this game. The graphics are choppy and many of the videos are fuzzy. There are better games out there for the money. Skip this one.
4,Firm and good size,This cushion fits well for a small adult wheelchair. Has contoured sides and serves the purpose well. It lasts a long time. I've had it for 6 years and doesn't even appear worn yet.
3,"Cracking the MCAT, Princeton review",This book is very easy to read and informations are well organized but it doesn't cover suficient amount of content to excel the MCAT exam.
5,"A.J. Berry's ""A Time of Terror"" Is A Keeper!","The title of this book doesn't do justice to its content. It is obvious that the author did extensive research, as source material references and end notes give evidence. This book is so well written that it will appeal to residents of historic upstate New York, students, and educators as well as genealogists and history buffs. Ms. Berry includes some stories that are not commonly mentioned, including a special section on the Loyalists. It is one of those books of non-fiction that is hard to put down. An extensive index of names is included in ""So It Was Written"", volume 2 of what will be a trilogy."
1,Disapointed,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was disappointed. The video did have some things that my husband thought he could use but it was not what he expected at all. He commented that it was such an armature production that many times the video was to dark or someone would be standing right in front of the person working so you could not see exactly what they were doing.
3,McClaren is a cheat,"This movie is based purely on the idea that McClaren created the Sex Pistols...*crickets*...The Real answer, he didn't. He sat in a corner played with his thumbs, while the band changed history. McClaren, the narrator of the movie (not documentary), tells a ""story"" of how he led the Pistols into a huge trap and created them from their rubble. THIS MOVIE DID NOT HAVE THE CONSENT OF THE SEX PISTOLS! John Lydon (lead singer a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) is not even in the movie, and claims this movie as a mockary. This is just a fictional entertainment based movie. This Movie is good for a laugh at McClaren's idea of what happened, but should not be judged as the true story."
5,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!,"If you like good beats and excellent ryhme he has it all this is a good cd and Im 100% sure lil zanes goin somewere with his rap career, honestly get this cd its great if you like music to bump to in your ride with great bass, trust me :-)"
5,Excellent Product,It took the clock about three hours to set. I recieved a good strong siginal after about 10 pm. The radio works very well and is easy to tune.
1,"Dont buy it if you live in a ""land far away""!","Agree with other reviews that the unit is a good radio. I found the various set-ups(alarms, etc.) confusing, but worse was trying to get the ""automatic time"" feature to work. It needs to find Boulder Colorado signal, and there are instructions that must be followed to a T. After trying many times I realize that it was not going to find the signal it required to set the time automatically. Since that is one of the chief reasons for paying extra for this clock radio, i give it only one star. If you live where the signal is easily picked up, then you may find this feature of value and choose to pay a little more. There are better clock radios out that cost less."
4,"Cool Accurate Clock, Bad User Interface","Of all the clock radios I've had, this one is my favorite. I don't find it flimsy, like the other reviewer said, but reasonably built for the price. Similarly the sound is just fine for me - about what you'd expect out of a cheap clock radio. And the fact that it synchronizes automatically is totally cool. When the clocks in my house get out of synch, it's good to have one that is accurate.On the other hand, using the controls is a real pain. On/Off is easy. Radio function is straight forward. But setting the alarm is a challenge every time I have to do it. And setting it up the first time was a REAL challenge. (It wasn't helped by the fact that I didn't know the time setting signal is only broadcast around 2 am so I kept messing with it.)A very cool clock but NOT for anyone who's VCR flashes 12:00 or who doesn't love playing with technology."
2,timex t303t,"very poor design for an alarm clock. tall with a narrow base. tends to fall off the head board when I turn off the alarm. not the way I really like to wake up, as in a lump on my head.The controls are hard to figure out and tend to be on the complicated side. If I have to dig out the instuctions every time I want to change something that is not very good.I would not buy this item."
4,review + howto set the timezone,"My wife and I have been using this clock for about 5 years now and like it very much.The dual alarm settings let us both set our own schedules, the atomic time feature has worked perfectly for us (including DST).The speaker doesn't sound tinny, and it's a perfect clock for waking up to music on.The interface isn't perfect, however the interface for almost every alarm clock leaves something to be desired, and I've encountered far worse.Howto Set the Timezone on a T303T:To set the time zone you hold down the ""Mode"" button until the map starts blinking. You then use the arrow buttons to select your zone.After you select it, you press Mode once, and it'll ask you whether you want daylight savings time detection on or off.Change that the same way, and press Mode once when done."
3,Daylight Savings Detection Is Not Working!!!,"Generally, I like this clock. But the Daylight Savings Detection is not working. It supposes to change the time automatically on day that daylights savings starts or ends, but it does not. I am 100% sure that I set it right. There are 2 possiblities; one is that it is defective or it has design fault, the other is that it rarely get signal from where I live. But it should not require signal for daylight savings detection to work because daylight savings happens the same time every year, so the clock should know when to set it by itself.The clock & alarm & other setting is quite different & more complicated than normal clocks, so setting a clock is a little difficult at first."
3,"Arrived damaged, not too happy about that.","My order arrived slightly damaged.The box it comes in off the shelf was a mess and all taped up. They should of placed that box inside a heavier shipping box. That way if the shipping department decides to play football with it, like this one looks like, it won't be damaged as much.Slight sharp dent on lip of inner container for the ice cream.I had thought it was one of those new electric jobs where you didn't need ice or rock salt. You still do.It's too big to have here at my small apartment.Going to have to get rid of it and look for a smaller one."
3,Very Nice Brazilian-tinged CD,"This is a solid release from Roditi, who plays well on all cuts and excellently on two -- IMHO. The rhythm section is capable and lays down a non-intrusive but supportive and intelligent background. This CD cuts across genres from hard bop to samba, with a stronger emphasis on a Brazilian ""feel"" than straight-ahead blowing."
5,Presto Cooker /Canner,I Love This Canner...I have used it for 2 seasons now and it is GREAT..So easy to use and it makes canning time a lot easier and faster...I would highly recommend this one to anyone....
2,Presto 23 quart,"Used this for the third time today.Bought 2 of them. Was Canning pork at 11 lbs, following exact directions. Was 30 minutes into canning. Regulator broke and blew. Not very safe. Hope the other doesnt do the same thing. Was impressed with how well they canned. Was shocked over this today. Just be careful when using this. Alot of great reviews here, but seen a few where same thing has happened."
5,Great Item,"With a large garden and much produce to preserve, we needed a pressure cooker for our home. Having borrowed one made by a different manufacturer - we had all kinds of problems getting it to work properly. Then, someone recommended the Presto and, after some research and reading reviews, we purchased it. All I can say is that it works great and we've had no problems so far."
4,Important sizing information,"This thing is great. One thing to keep in mind when choosing the size of your cooker is that you can only fill it half way when cooking beans or rice. You can only fill it 2/3 full when cooking other stuff. So get one that is bigger than you think you might need. I almost got the 16 quart. I'm so glad I got the 23.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the directions say I'll have to keep buying new rubber parts every 3 or so years. Two washers, an overpressure release and the main gasket. I know some of the higher end cookers are gasketless."
4,Great for the price,"Happy with purchase, but how nice it would be if it came with adjustable regulator instead of having to purchase it separately."
5,Works Great,"I bought the Pressure Cooker/Canner 2 weeks ago and have used it 3 times already. It works wonderfully, easy to use, easy to clean!! I am wondering what did I do before I got this thing?"
1,Gauge wildly inaccurate,"I used this pressure canner just fifteen times, so it was still practically new when I had the gauge tested by my local cooperative extension. The gauge is off by three full pounds, meaning that all of the low-acid food that I'd intended to can at 11 psi, was in fact canned at only 8 psi. What a lot of work and expense, to result in potentially toxic food! When I first got the canner, I didn't like the way it was so slow to build pressure, so I called Presto, and they said they'd check it out but only if I paid shipping both ways. I decided against sending it back....dumb move! I called Presto today after having the gauge tested, and the best that the customer service could offer was to send me a new gauge. I am pretty sure that the entire canner is defective, and I am never using it again. Looks like I'm out the money to replace it, and I can assure you that I will not purchase anything by Presto, ever again!"
3,Very tall - be sure to measure your clearance for stovetop!,"Just a precautionary tale... I have an OTR Microwave, and I cannot fit this on my stove due to clearance. With the top and gauges, this stands over 16 inches, and you will need several more over and above that to get jars in and out of this (too heavy to more when full). Unless you have a pressing need to stack pints two high, this is overkill, and limits its usefulness in today's kitchens. I am exchanging for the 16 qt model, which also does 7 quarts."
1,quality preassure cooker,We have purchased several pressure cookers and by far this one is the best out right now and it is a great price.
4,Great Product for Price,"This is a great product especially for the price. It takes so much less time to can items because it allows you to put so many pints/quarts in the pot. It is also very easy to use. It is very heavy... and sometimes the lid is a bit tricky to get on, but other than that you can't beat the price!"
4,Great Product!,"Great product. I am new to canning and wanted to get a pressure canner because I was concerned with having the proper acidity levels in the boiling water bath method. I also want to be able to can vegetables, and this is the right product for that. The owners manual is very complete and also available on the internet. I have it printed for my kitchen as well as have the one that came with it stored with the cooker. That way I can constantly be thinking about ideas and use the printed copy as my reference. Bought it on Amazon, and had it delivered overnight because I was in such a hurry to use it. Two weeks later I opened the box."
5,Best purchase I made this year.,"Important piece of advice: If you are buying this pressure canner, go now and add the pressure regulatorPresto Pressure Canner Pressure Regulatorand an additional cooking/canning rackPresto Cooking/Canning Rack for Pressure Cannerto your order. This pressure canner is made to handle a double stack of pint jars- just put one rack on the bottom as normal, load some seven pint jars then add another rack and load it with seven pints, too. The adjustable pressure regulator (which really should come with this pressure canner) will save your sanity. I love canning but the constant baby sitting to try to maintain 11 lbs of pressure drove me crazy. Up and down, up and down every 10 to 15 minutes. With the adjuster, just set it up for the 10 lbs pressure and keep an ear tuned. Life saver!"
1,Presto 23 quart,Used this for the third time today. Canning pork at 11 lbs. Was 30 minutes into canning. Regulator broke and blew. Not very safe. I ordered 2 hope the other doesnt do the same thing.
4,Presto pressure cooker,works great it is a must if you do a lot of caning.We have canned about 100 quarts of beans and peppers and stuff.
3,Doesn't work very well on a glass top stove.,This took an inordinately long time to come up to pressure...I think because of my glass top stove but I'm not sure.
1,Better off burning your money than purchasing this,"This garbage is not worth owning. The creator is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The creator or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these vidoes. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
4,Time Off For Good Behavior,"This book was alot of fun. I normally just read who done its! But I thought I would shake it up, and Ms. Rich did just that. Very funny!"
3,Snack reading,"Entertaining for a while, some parts I had to read aloud to my husband (because I was chuckling out loud) but not a very nourishing story. That's okay if that's the kind of reading you are looking for - fun, light, forgettable - like a silly romantic comedy."
4,Recommend as First DVD player,"Great features, beautiful design. Runs fastmotion DVD's well and the DTS digital sound is beautiful. Power switch on the remote would be nice. Also a low priced DVD player with component video would be cool, but all in all it is a SOLID 4. Don't listen to reviewers who had a faulty player. If it isn't damaged, it is a thing of beauty...the price too."
2,Disappointed it is not CDG Capable,"The box is somewhat disceptive, it states that it is Karaoke Capable, however it does not play the graphics on the CDG Format for Karaoke Discs. That is the reason that I purchased this unit and I am disappointed about it. The rest of the features are good and the DVD quality is fine but I really wanted a unit that was CDG Capable and this unit is mis-leading. I give them a thumbs down for that fact."
3,Great lead in.....dwindles at the end,"I like Bentley little he truely has a gift of writing prose and the build up of taking you through a story with a minimal of description and more action makes him a fast read. I was so excited about reading this book and I made it about 90 percent through the book without a hiccup even though everything was kind of ridiculous. The end of the book was lacking in the explanation of the villian. I think that if he just spent a little time on describing who his villian was it would have made the story payoff so much more. Other than that, it was not a complete waste of time. Great Ideas....I would recommend this book to others. Bentley is like a cup of coffee....and acquired taste."
2,"""My first Bentley Little book--and probably my last., ""","The above is a quotation from a review of another Bentley Little book, written by another reviewer, but it applies just as well to my opinion of this book. I try not to review books I haven't finished, but I know in my heart I will never finish this one.The writing is bland. The characterization is often laughable. The dialogue is primarily just thinly-veiled authorial screeds. It was just an all-around bad book, although at least it was written in complete sentences."
1,One Star for One Song,"I love ska. I love the Specials 1st Album and Ghost Town. On this CD you get the Keith Richard's whammy, ""One hit and (X-1) trax of crap"" (rhymes). Can you guess which song is not vapid? The rest of the album needs more vitamins. Save your money and get ""I Just Can't Stop It"" by The Beat - English."
1,Can't review - what I cannot get,"HISTORY OF THE SHENANDOAH VALLEYI cannot review this since every time I order this ""used"" copy I receive notification a day later that the order cannot be filled; yet the ""used"" copy remains ""available"" on Amazon. I've ordered it twice now. What is going on?"
5,I love it!!,"I had this when it first came out on 8 track . I had it for 5yrs. and it broke and I about cried! Tiny Tim has a beautiful voice. FOR about 20 yrs. or more I've been looking for it and then I found it only here at amazon! I thank all of you at amazon for this.I can't wait for it to get at my house, I am so excited to finely get to hear it again. I've been driveing my wife crazy with humming Tip Toe Through the Tulips. Thanks amazon thanks so much ! You don't know how much this means to me."
3,Discs get unusually hot,"Not bad,It does all it says it does.dvd,vcd. Not to many bells and whistles though.user interface for mp3s is lacking. does not list entire file name. Letters are blocky. Not exactly like having windows media player on your tv. discs get unusually hot,hopefully doesn't become a problem. I bought it because my tv & sourround sys are also rca,for that I like it, one remote.Basically priced well for what it does but if you dont have other rca equip. might as well try some other brand."
3,It's ok,It's a good product to practice. but for this product you really have to watch the video before getting this item.
3,Bonnie Prince Charlie [VHS],"I would have given this film a higher rating except for ONE glaring omission: there was no climactic Battle of Culloden. Only a short melodramatic aftermath. That director Anthony Kimmins, let alone the film producers, would omit the one battle that continues to haunt the Scottish psyche some 260 years later borders on criminal. That said, the second unit shots of highland Scotland (Glen Coe, Glenfinnan, Eilean Donan Castle, Isle of Skye, & Kyle of Lochalsh, to name a few) are all first-rate. Also, the scenes of Jacobite highlanders tramping across the highlands evoke Scottish memories (mostly afore-mentioned highlander) of wishing they should have marched on to London after the victory at York to dictate terms to the Hanoverians.This movie is a great example of my belief that there are no bad film ideas. Only 'less than stellar' executions of said ideas. (See the film ""Speed"".)"
2,A bunch of worksheets,"This workbook strikes me more as busy work than anything else. A science textbook doesn't need a lot of corresponding worksheets. A science book should have a lab notebook and a bunch of labs.About half of the worksheets in the book are okay, as worksheets go."
3,excellent book for advanced students,"Because it was impossible to look inside the book at time of order, this proved not to be what I expected from it when I ordered. Geological phenomena and processes are treated superficially. In my opinion the book seems to be oversimplified. Contrast pictures were not satisfactory. There are not references. Paper quality is poor. However the book is useful rather to the advanced students in geology to verify knowledge."
5,Much needed guide to Christian living!!!,"The authors approach is non intrusive. His practical teaching tools draws the reader to diligently search themselves and implement the necessary steps to maturity. As he states, Walk the Talk, I LOVE IT. This non intrusive guide is a must for all believers. I wish I had these pearls when I began my journey years ago. It would have helped me overcome some of the many hurdles in my process. I highly recommend this to everyone. What Now Lord will enlighten the eyes of your understanding. His practical, yet informative 12 steps program is so rich that I recommend it to all pastors and teachers of the word.Refreshing and delightful and a NECESSARY addition to your library of Christian living."
2,a tribute,These cd is only for the hardcore prodigy fans because you well buy it anyway the cd is not that great in all it sounds like most of the dj's and bands who tribute on here used 80's keyboards there's some sample from the orginal songs also on there from most of the songs i say in all the song on here that (liam howlett) could have tribute on if he was really mest up could have been CLIMBATIZE BY JOOLZ peace out
2,You Need a Proofreader!,"Didn't anyone else have a problem with the fact this book was riddled with errors? Or is it that there aren't enough readers who recognize that books should be grammatically correct? There are words left out of sentences, gross grammatical errors, misspellings, even words that don't exist! (I dare you to find a definition for 'viverent')I'm sure there's a story there somewhere, but to have to mentally edit every page is annoying. Unfortunately, I'm afraid the people who edited this book didn't recognize all of the errors, and I feel that this publishing house needs to hire a more meticulous editor if they would like to be taken seriously."
2,Wasted money and time...!%%##%$&&*%#,"Sophmoric and childish. If you have money you just need to blow, go buy tissue."
3,cheap,"This inexpensive toolbox was to replace my older, but more well-made metal one that has finally started looking too worn and flaking paint everywhere. My ""new"" one arrived with a dent in the top and another smaller dent on the front along with some scratches. The dent in top is probably why it also doesn't close cleanly. I'm assuming this happened during shipping, but it does let you know that this is a low-end option for your tool holding needs. Not a surprise at the price, but I feel a little put out to receive something new in a damaged condition. I'll continue looking for a decently-priced, sturdier replacement."
5,Enlightment into a hidden culture,"As a doctorate student working on my dissertation concerning the impact multicultural tradebooks have on attitudes of children I found this book an excellent source needed in the classroom. Prejudice and misconceptions of ""others"" who do not look like or act like the mainstream culture causes an intolerance from too many U.S. citizens whose family endured the same years ago. Children can learn and sympathy through the reading of this fabulous novel."
1,Let's not overgeneralize,"""Overplayed and overvalued"" applies neither to the Schubert nor the Mozart-both are sublime and immortal masterpieces. The Verdi and the Gounod may be lesser, but they are certainly worthy pieces. However, it is obvious that this haphazard compilation is quite superfluous. Superior collections of sacred music abound, many at bargain prices."
4,great for low carb diets.,Our doctor suggested these when my husband &I started a low carb diet. We would get desperate for anything with a crunch.
2,one of Block's worst,"Lawrence Block is a great writer and, in his autobiography,Step by Step, he says that this is one of his favorite books and that he wrote it in a burst of energy in two weeks straight. Unfortunately, only the latter makes sense. This just isn't a very good book.It is severely handicapped by a completely absurd line of silly mystic mumbo-jumbo that propels its characters on their ""walk."" They are boring because there is no conflict. They join the walk, they experience a miracle cure, they all get along. The other half of the book is from the point of view of a prolific serial killer. He is not boring, but he sure is super creepy, so much so that it's hard to enjoy the book.The Kindle formatting is fine, no issues.Skip this one unless you are a New Age loon, a serial killer, or a Block completist."
4,Aprende a programar en VB 6,Con este libro podrás aprender lo básico de programar en Visual Basic hasta llegar a convertirte en un experto en esta herramienta de desarrollo. Incluye todas las novedades de esta nueva versión.
2,Not the best I have read,"This book was written by a man for men, that is obvious. I read it and tried to read it without fuming at the mouth. Men do like woman who will respect and love them <as woman like men who will love and respect them> but no one likes a spouse who will obey them and be their maid. The way I read and understood this book is that woman cant be a man's equal in the corporate world and that men cant the be the equal to a woman in the home. That is so untrue. Not all women need a man to do things for them. I am self sufficient. My husband works out of the country alot and I have to do the yard, take care of the cars, take care of the kids,clean the house, do all the cooking and pay the bills. I dont ask for help nor do I need it. It did have some interesting points. For instance the poems are great <about love>, how growing together strengthens a married. A marriage is not one-sided. I just couldnt get myself to really like this book."
5,An excellent Biblically based guide for marriage,"Despite what other reviewers have said, I did not, in any way, get the impression that Mr. Barnes was suggesting that women should be a man's maid or that they cannot succeed in a career. Rather, he is suggesting that we all, men and women, use the Bible as our guide in our relationships. He suggests that we both look in ourselves for our individual strengths and weaknesses and rather than compete with each other, we should compliment each other. We should also work to make our relationship with our spouse the biggest priority in our lives, above careers, other interests, etc. Too often we allow outside interests and influences distract us from our true beliefs and values. I am a computer consultant, mother and wife and found this book to be truly enriching and inspiring. If you want to be married for the next 50 years, and are willing to follow the Bible, this is the book for you!"
2,Totally quiet or too loud,"I'm not sure about others, but the volume control is either way too loud, or way too soft. What's up with that? That's okay if you're waking up, but what if you just want to listen to the radio? And the Nature Sounds (Brook, Ocean, or Birds) only have one volume setting!!The 'minute set' feature works by only pressing the button for each minute change - there's no 5-minutes at a time, or whatever to speed up the time setting. The Alarm Reset button is quite stiff as well. You've gotta really press it to get it activated (or deactivate the alarm).The only plus this thing has is it's 9-volt battery compartment (ie. there IS one).Ack!!!"
4,Great Story,"This book took me on highs and lows I love it when books can bring out emotions, and this one did just that. Great story . Looking forward to the follow up"
4,Great sex and crazy woman,THis was a great book until the end. she took you off the subject at had you dont find out what happened after she caught them in the act.
2,The Title Makes You Wanna Read It BUT IT'S A BAD BOOK.,"OK, So a friend of mine told me about this book. Telling me what a great book it was, So I purchuse it. After the 4 ch. I put it down, already knowing it was a book that will go on and on. But I finished after 2weeks which is'nt like me. I will useally finsh a good book in 2-3 days. All and all this book is'nt exciting. nor mind blowing. It's like you know whats coming next, SMH. I don't even wanna get part 2. but I hope that Monica character get hers.Oh and I did'nt understand why Rico had to die like that. His personality in the book did'nt seem like he should of when out like that....BAD BOOK!"
4,NGK TE66 Wire Set,"The spark plug wires worked well in my 2002 4runner, however a couple of minor complaints:1) Wire 3 seemed longer than the OEM wire.2) The placement of the wire reinforcements (extra plastic sheaths) interfered with routing brackets and needed to be moved."
3,"A Love Album, Clown Style","Though ""Stomp"" and ""Prom Queen"" are amongst my favorite ICP songs, it still seems ICP ran out of some of their creative fuel between Riddlebox and Milenko. A lot about this album seems rushed. It's good for what it is though, a sex album done ICP style, and they came correct with it. Don't expect any real meaningful tracks on this one though as on other albums by ICP. The majority of the tracks are comedic, and it's a novelty album really. It's something to bump now and then though. Tunnel of Love is deffinatly a worthwhile addition to any Psychopathic collection but I wouldn't say it stands out in ICP's discography."
5,GREAT SONG MAN!!,"This is most definitely the best song that has come out in a long time. Lately, there hasn't been much of men writing love songs, but this one is PERFECT. I thought Jodeci's breaking up was bad, but K-CI and Jo-Jo (with his fine tail) have been doing better by themselves. This song is wonderful!! and it's soooooooooooo TRUE!"
4,A good product,"My daughter loved the Toddler decks, so I purchased this one. She is not even three yet and could answer most of the questions. But, what I like about them is that they expand her vocabulary and help her with comparisons. They also reinforce counting and other important skills. We have moved on to the decks for ages 4-5 and she is enjoying those too. FYI, comparison shop, sometimes you can find them at warehouse stores for nearly half the suggested retail price."
4,"Love Brain Quest, but too easy","We have the 2yo pack through the kindergarten pack and love them. If your kid is 4, definitely get the 4-5 pack. I think this pack (3-4 yo)is more appropriate for 2-3 yos, but I generally like the questions to be more difficult so we have something to talk about, rather than just Q&A back and forth like she's being quizzed."
2,Selfish and self-absorbed main characters ruin what could be good,"It seems like everyone in this book doesn't give a hoot about anyone but themselves, which is thoroughly annoying and displeasing. Having now read the entire series, I can say that the unlikeability and selfishness of the characters continues, and it is definitely not a series I recommend.*Warning--Spoilers!*Marla peeved me off having an affair with that idiot Nash and cheating on Laran, who was decent and could have been really good with her. It reminded me a little of J.V. Jones'The Baker's Boy (Book of Words)except in that Melli gets pregnant and DOESN'T cheat on her husband. Elezaar also made me angry, not doing what was best for Marla but what was best for him."
3,Simpsons sure have changed,Bought this for a kick of nostalgia. It's funny to look at the first season and see the change in the looks of all the characters and the evolution of the show. A classic TV staple that helped turn Fox into a viable network against what was once the big 3 networks.
2,1st season SUCKED,"I LOVE the Simpsons, but the 1st season BLEW. Save your money for ""Complete Season"" DVD's of any other season. Okay, maybe the first season is still better than most animated series, but is trash compared to every other season. Crude animation, and just not really funny. Mostly because the focus was still mostly on Bart. But as the seasons progressed, Homer evolved (if you can even use that word on him) from an angry, abusive, hot-tempered dad to a stupid, bumbling idiot. The focus of the show shifted from Bart to Homer, and everything has been all good since."
4,Short first season but a classic!,"Excellent DVD - brought back memories of when I first saw the simpsons on TV almost a decade ago. The animation and sound quality are not up to the standards of the current season obviously, but the writing is top notch."
5,Simpsons Season One Superb,"This first edition of many Simpsons DVDs to come features the first thirteen classic episodes from season one. ""The Simpsons Christmas Special"", the first episode to air (1989) perfectly introduces the family, and also features the firts apperances of Patty, Selma, Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders, Todd, and Santa's Little Helper. Besides the hillarious other episodes with introductions to Mr. Smithers, Grandpa, Krusty, and Bart's arch-nemesis Sideshow Bob, there comes some spectacular extra features: Original scripts to a few episodes, Outtakes from Albert Brooks in ""Life on the Fast Lane"", the making of the Simpsons, the first Tracy Ullman Simpsons Short, and an original pilot episode of Some Enchanted Evening. It is interesting to the see the evolution of the characters, animation, and storylines. I recommend this outstanding DVD for any Simpsons fan who appreciates the first season."
4,This would be better if it was the BEST 12 episodes,"The only problem with this dvd is that the simpsons have evoved so much since the first season. These episodes are the classics that you have seen in repeats for years now. Unfortunately, Homer is so much more stupid and FUNNY in the later episodes. The first season is a must-own for any Simpsonphile, but be warned that it is not the Simpsons that we are used to today. The plots are much more linear and again, Homer is not as dumb."
4,The Simpsons..Complete First Season,"I thought that this was an excellent DVD set. I reccommend it to all Simpsons Fans. However, I don't reccommend buying all the sets (we'll be dead by the time the season 15 set comes along). I suggest watching the re-runs on television, seeing as they appear just about daily."
4,A Pretty Good Start To The Longest Running Cartoon Show!,"I am a huge Simpsons fan! The special features are very good! The picture has been cleaned up greatly, and the audio has been remastered in 5.1 surround! While the episodes from the first season weren't very good and the voice artists sound terrible, There are quite a few laughs and in the end, your craving more Simpsons! I do wish that Matt Groening would have added the shorts that were made before the first season, but maybe he has plans to release those as another DVD set! I can't wait until Season 2 is out!"
5,"Great DVDs and commentaries, but one part missing.","I'll spare you the review of the DVDs and stuff; hundreds of people have done that. What people may not notice is that there are two parts missing from The Telltale Head, because they seem to have encoded the second Fox run (which was shortened slightly) - the missing parts are intact in syndication, so it seems to be simply an oversight. ... hopefully, they will rerelease this disc or put the full episode on the season 2 DVD.(Added in fall 02: The opening text credits at the beginning of 7G05 are mysteriously missing. It seems like a technical oversight, and the odd thing is that when a particular one would come up in the correct version, the commentary mentions that story. Odd, huh?)"
3,"I love the Simpsons, but this is a bit rediculous","You can't watch all the episodes at once on these DVD's. You must first select the episode, then select to play that episode. Then when it's done playing, you have to go back a menu level, select another episode, the select PLAY to watch that one...and so on and so forth.The people who designed these DVD's are FIRED, as it is the most harrassing & annoying setup I have ever seen. But it's the only way to get the episodes on DVD currently available. I suggest getting a good DVD maker/copier and totally redoing this DVD set after you buy it so you can stick a DVD in and watch all the episodes. Quite the crock for [so much money], eh?"
1,"My favorite show, but what's up with the DVD.","I asked for this about 2,0000 times for christmas. I got it, and the top of the screen sucked. The color wasn't cleaned up (nor the sound), and the special features did, too (besides the directors dommentaries and scripts, I could watch them all in 20 mins). The second season was better. I'll but it. But, the First Season was no better than my old videotapes."
2,Support your library,"I did and I am glad. The library provided me with a two week preview of the dvd. The library is probably the sole American institution with a stitch of intergrity, but that has nothing to do with the Simpsons Vol. 1, at least not directly (I have a liberal arts degree). So let's face facts here - this DVD is not very good. To be fair, the dvd performed the required technical functions, but the content was a major problem. The animation sucks, the voices are annoying and it's not very funny.I used to think the Simpsons were funny, but I can't figure out why. The Simpsons is like eating frozen fish, bearable but a really waste of time and resources. For $30 or $40, buy a funny book or the Mr Show dvds."
2,You get what you pay for,"No radio, nature sounds may be good, but sound horrible through the .5"" speaker in the unit. There is no indication that the alarm is set by glancing at the display. I guess it keeps time ok, but it would be worth paying more for something better. This doesn't cut it even for minimal use."
2,Not what I was looking for:,"The ""buzzer"" on this alarm clock sounds more like a wristwatch alarm. I don't know about anyone else, but that's not going to wake me up in the morning. I'll be returning it."
3,British Procedural that could use some umph,"My first book by Roy Hart. I picked it up because I love a good British mystery. The British part is very good, the procedural part is not bad but this book lacks warmth and personality. I plan to purchase one more of this author's books in the hope that the next one has more depth. Stay tuned..."
4,Excellent,"Beautifully written. Short stories in a typical, imaginative Boyd style, which makes him one of my favourite authors. A book to escape into."
3,Cover art is from the wrong season,"The cover art for the fourth season has all the actors looking like they did in the first. Perhaps an intelligent excuse could be made that SHOUT FACTORY! wanted to bookend the releases with a nostalgic pic of the group as we knew them, but I doubt the art department thought that deeply. At the onset of releasing THIRTYSOMETHING, SHOUT FACTORY! treated it with a lot of TLC. Subsequent releases however, have suffered in quality - as is apparent with the lackluster image quality on the Season 3 DVD. The first two seasons were apparently transferred from the original film elements. Still, one could just be grateful that the series now is complete and archived in a format that will not suffer future erosion by poor care of the original source elements. And dance by the light of the moon."
4,"fun, jaded, quick read",This isn't a book as much as a quick guide to the jaded language of the way new world. I enjoyed it a lot but it isn't a substantial read. Much fun to be had in keeping this one in your desk for those special Dilbert moments.
3,Just oaky,"Fairly esay to install. I did not have an internal usb connection on the mother board so I had to run the cable through the back of the computer. Not a big deal and it works fine. I have discovered that when plugging in more than one connection at a time, some devices stop working. Overall, not bad, but other hubs I've used have performed better."
1,Stopped working after using it twice,"I bought this because the reviews were good - however, after using it only twice it no longer was making a connection with my phone in order to charge it. The retractable feature is neat though. It only has a 30 day warranty so of course it stopped working after the 30 days! Oh well!"
3,When how much of the conversation has been overheard is unknown,"Mrs. Plumleigh-Bruce is a colonel's widow and a product of the Anglo-Indian set. Her vanity is insatiable. Ralph Gorse is the son of a commercial artist He loves trickery, a mixture of Bertie Wooster and Satan.The writer is funny. For example, the pub, The Friar, has been 'ye-olded' recently. The house of Mrs. Plumleigh-Bruce is filled with brass objects. At one point Hamilton refers to it as the brasserie. It is situated in a neighborhood of garden gnomes.Donald Stimpson is an estate agent and a friend of Joan Plumleigh-Bruce. He is a plodder and does not see Gorse as a rival. The author demonstrates that Gorse has method. He goes for the long shot. He investigates the social and financial circumstances of acquaintances by listening carefully. All of this is unpleasant and striking in the manner of Shirley Jackson.The book has been used as the basis of a mini-series."
3,"Missing plug and plug puller, useless!","The ball came nicely packaged, but without the plug and the plug puller! If i didn't already have these items from a previously broken exercise ball from another company, this purchase would of had to been returned. The ball is a quality ball and very sturdy. Buyer beware."
4,sizing is wrong but good product,"I got this workout ball because I have cats and every time I've gotten one in the past the cats seem to be able to pop them with their claws. This one is great because it can't be popped and it just feels sturdier. The only problem I have with it is that I am exactly 5'6 and it is on the small side for me. So I would recommend that if you are on the edge of what they recommend for size, go the one step bigger otherwise you will regret it."
1,Disappointed with the manufacturer,"In the product description and on the directions that came in the box it says a pump is supposed to be included. However, there was no pump in the box. In the box was the ball, measuring tape, two plugs, a plug removal tool, and a fitting that looks like it is supposed to connect to the missing pump. Luckily my bicycle pump has a fitting that worked to air up the ball. When the ball was packaged it was folded and crammed in to the box so tightly that it created crease marks, and now there are wrinkles on the fully expanded ball. I am worried that this may cause some pressure points and I worry that it could cause the ball to burst. Overall I am very disappointed with my purchase and I haven't even used it yet. Judging by the reviews of different brands it seems like Amazon is not the place to shop for fitness balls as all of them seem to have issues with mislabeled or missing parts."
4,"Not big enough for 5'9""","I ordered this excisize ball for my husband who is 5'9"". However, it couldn't reach the size that described 65cm. I recommend you order one size bigger."
5,wonderful piece of past present and future,How can we understand the world we live in today if we have no understanding of how and why we are at the point we are at. Should be required reading for humanity.
4,Good Gumption and Common Sense,"This was my first reading of Reverend Stanton's work. I must admit I have never read any of Karl Bahrdt's work, and was a bit put off. Having been a prolific reader most of my life, it is a rare occurrence when I do not finish a book. Undaunted I continued and found Stanton's stories from life inspiring. I soon found myself looking for my ""highlighter pen"" to mark worthy material. Remembering the book was on loan,I continued. Continuing brought me to the realization I had not read a more common sense approach to the scriptures since my first reading of C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. Upon returning my ""loaner copy"" I immediately ordered one copy of The Door of Hope and four more copies of the Gospel of Good Gumption for friends. Quiters never win, they need Gumption."
1,reader in CA,"It's hard to believe the characters. The man she falls in love with treats her so badly, I don't know how anyone could even like him, much less love him. He treats her cruelly at times. Hastings, the women, acts like a door mat much of the time. At the end, some of the characters undergo personality transformations after they realize they all have been mean to the poor Hastings. I wanted to puke. People do not change that much."
2,DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS,"i first bought this book because i was curious when i read the reviews here at amazon. i was just beginning to discover catherine coulter's work but i have already read a good amount of her books. i found this book to be somewhat offensive. the only features that i found fascinating were the animals. the sex scenes were somewhat a consolation to me for wasting my time on reading it. TO SENSITIVE WOMEN: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! if you're going to buy this book let me give a piece of advice: IF YOURE A FIRST TIME READER OF COULTER'S BOOKS THEN U WONT LOOK INTO THIS BOOOK AS A DISAPPOINMENT. IF U'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED COULTER'S WORKS I SUGGEST THAT U SKIP THIS PARTICULAR BOOK OF HERS COZ I'M PRETTY SURE U'LL CONSIDER THIS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF U'RE NOT SURE IF U'LL LIKE THIS BOOK, GO TO THE LIBRARY AND BORROW IT !!!"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK. Keep in mind the time period. Women were considered property. This book has a wonderful array of characters. Hastings is a headstrong woman who actually does not change all that much through the book. I have passed this book on to two of my co-workers who loves this hillarious romantic book. Read the entire book and find out what happens. I guarantee you'll love it as much as I did.
2,This is a story of beating someone until they submiss.,"The title of the book has nothing to do with the content.I found the marten; Trist to have skills that were not believable. This animal seemed to read minds and even sat on Hastings when Severin ordered him too. There are many examples of that in the book. The animal was cute but it took up too much of the book. I did not like the message in the book which was to dominate and suppress the women. Rape them into compliance. Beat then when they dared disobey. Continually telling them that are owned by their husbands. Hastings was tied up to the Wolfhound dog in front of the dinner table while all ate. I was shocked at the degradation. Marjorie should have recieved punishment for what she did but instead she got what she wanted. The book made me angry. I felt that it degraded women with the scenes of rape, humiliation and beatings. This is not a love story, it's a sad story. I didn't hate the book, it's the message it gave that I hate."
3,Sex and violence in 1277 A.D.,"I was left curiously flat after reading this romance. The heroine was a fishwife and her husband an unfeeling clod. That would be OK if the author had redeemed the characters by exploring their depths, revealing their joys and sorrows, etc., but that just didn't happen. I still didn't like either of them much at the end of the book. The ""Rosehaven"" subplot is thrown in almost as an afterthought and adds nothing to the real story. Worst of all, the true villain of the book, not the one the author would have you believe is the bad guy, does not get her richly-deserved comeuppance (I would have loved to see her drink a potion that would turn her glorious head of hair green or something.) Good dialogue, realistic background, and decent sex scenes do make the book worth reading"
5,Wham-O Frisbee,Absolutley the best 0n the market.Brings back a lot of memories from when I was a kid.Everyone has a blast with the Wham-O Frisbee.You will love it!
4,"the good parts are very good, but...","When we see Hogan and Snead actually playing golf, this is a great video. Unfortunately, maybe 1/3 of it is taken up with documentary material about the Houston area, where the golf course is, and the entire match is not even shown! The Hogan shots are a must-have, however, and a 2 minute bonus of Ben demonstrating his swing is almost worth the price of admission."
2,"The CD was okay, but it lacks something....","This band is okay. It sounded like any typical early 90's alternative band. It needs to be unique, it needs to stand out, and this CD doesn't give it that edge."
1,So Uncomfortable!,"This headset might sound great, but it's so uncomfortable on my head! It's narrow and has a ""hard"" bow to the top of it, so you can't adjust the way it curves over the top of your head. The result is that I have to open it all the way up and then kind of perch it on my head, holding the earphone against my ear. BUT, because of the shape it's bowed at, the hard plastic piece that sits on the other side of my head above my ear ends up pressing too hard and giving me a headache. Honestly, I'm mystified by the great reviews... If I had saved the packaging, I'd return this. Alas, I'm out the money."
1,Could Koss let you kinow???,"Bought this to do some gaming and found that the mic doesn't work. When I got a hold of Koss they said ""oh, it needs a Bias Supply""... Googled that and the only thing that comes up is Koss CS95 description, which I thought ironic because they didn't bother to put the requirement in the description here on Amazon. Searched Koss' site to buy the item and it comes up blank. Searched the internet and found $60-299 pre-amps to power this $20 headset... Hmm, maybe they could have let me know and I'd have just bought a plantronic that you plug in and it works automatically."
2,Causes a Headache with bad design,"I purchased this product as an add-on to Dragon Home 12.0. The side that has the clip (non-ear phone side) puts so much pressure on the head that it actually hurts. I tried bending it outward to the point of breaking but it still puts too much pressure on the head. Turns out Dragon has a headset in the box with the software that is free and much more comfortable. Were it not for the cost, I would have sent it back. I find the best headsets are the ones with two ear phones, not just one."
5,Great Show,"House is a great show. I watched it all along, but missed a few crucial episodes that were shifted due to football. Now I can catch up with the shows I missed and fill in the over-arching story line. I think this show could have gone for several more years."
5,MAUVIEL COPPERBRILL COPPER CLEANER,We purchased Mauviel cookwear when we were in France and they gave us a container of their cleaner. It puts the rest of the copper cleaners to shame.
3,This is Normally Closed circuit (Not what I expected!),"This is a ""Normally Closed"" circuit (Current flows). Meaning that when you press on it the circuit opens (No Current flows). If your using for a keyboard or anything else this will be important to know. I'm going to rewire it so that it's ""Normally Open"". Hopefully it will then work ok. The description doesn't say if it's NO (normally open) or NC (normally closed) which makes for problems. ... Mike."
4,Sustain pedal,"I purchased thinking that it would prolong the key sound while it is depressed, but it works the opposite of that."
5,Plug Adapter,"I went to Ireland and these worked perfectly! My friend forgot to bring one so he loaned one of ours. I would suggest buying an extra, just in case you forget one behind as well."
1,No Good,"I have two of these adapters, and both units have failed. They have lasted less than a year. Very disappointing."
1,POLARITY!!!,"This adapter reverses the polarity. To be honest, I have not found ANY adapter of this type that does not reverse polarity.You might think polarity, that is which pin is live and which one is current return, is sort of irrelevant. And in most cases you'd be right. However, consider the case of any appliance that has a ground. It is quite possible that they require the correct polarity.I discovered this with a 220v -> 110v transformer: If the polarity feeding it is wrong, you will be getting 110v out but floated at 110v!!! Again, sounds like a triviality but it is not. I resorted to building my own adapters for the transformers I run and using these adapters for things that are polarity insensitive.I am just shocked that any reputable company would not get this right!!! I have yet to find an adapter of this kind that does the right thing."
2,Did not work well,"This product did not work well. The contacts in the US side were so loose that it would not hold the plug, kept falling out of the adaptor and never would make contact. I realize that this was an inexpensive product but was not worth what I paid. Fortunately I was able to purchase a different kind that did work..."
1,Don't buy,"I received this item right before I left to study abroad in the UK, and it doesn't work at all. I have tried every single outlet for it and when plugging in the US plug into the adaptor, it does not stay in. I was highly disappointed. If it wasn't for the fact I received a different one as a gift, I would be out of luck or have to buy one here. Which is really expensive."
1,You can get a better adapter for less money elsewhere.,"I saw the reviews warning that this adapter doesn't hold the US plug very well, but more recent reviewers seemed to have positive experiences so I gave it a try. No dice. The adapter just doesn't hold the 2-prong plugs well. Unfortunately, it seems Amazon just doesn't stock quality adapters at this time."
2,Be aware - use with low watt devices only,"Just received item and have not yet had an opportunity to use it. However, label on back states ""It's not for use with high-watt devices such as hairdryers and irons"". So be aware this will only work lower watt usage devices like consumer electronics. Wish the Amazon website had specified this information."
3,"Cute, but on the best Bratz cat",I like this Bratz cat but not as much as some of the other ones.I don't like how the cat is wearing clothes.
5,Wonderful,I bought these to go with Dragon Software and they work wonderfully I would recommend them highly. Easy to use.
2,stopped working after 6 months,Worked fine for first six months and then the microphone stopped working. dont know whether it was a bad copy.
4,Headset/microphone used for Blackboard class,"Actually, this headset was recommended by University Alaska Southeast for an inexpensive but reliable product for use during an online webmeet class. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity and white noise reduction. The headset has a long enough cord where you could get up and move around without having to stretch to reach for something."
5,Koss CS100 Speech Recognition Computer Headset,"I could have used the mic set with the Dragon speechware, however this is very much better. It helps with clear speech and hearing for any application. Would recommend it. A great product at a reasonable price."
2,Better Options for Dragon Dictation,I bought this headset and have generally been disappointed for dragon dictation usage. The Cyber Acoustics AC201 is better at less price (~$10). But adding an audio pod made the biggest difference in terms of quality. This website was awesome for explaining the everything [...] The difference when I bought these devices was pretty substantial.
5,Works well for its purpose.,Bought this for use with Dragon (voice recognition program) and found it works quite well for the purpose of speaking. Have no complaints as the sound was adequate for what it was needed for.
1,A disappointment from Koss,"I'm very disappointed with this Koss product. I've used Koss headphones in the past (apparently in the distant past, as this is the first Koss item I've bought in over 10-12 years), and have been pleased with both their construction and performance. However, this has got to be one the cheapest plastic headsets I've ever seen (and tried to use). Perhaps I expected more from Koss, even at the low price. It was ill-fitting, and difficult to adjust as the mic boom doesn't swing down far enough; I was not able to get a comfortable fit at all. And, right out of the package, the left earpiece was non-functional. I could not recommend this unit for anyone, at any price."
3,They grow on you....,"The first bag I hated,,,the second not so much,,,,by the fifth bag I was rather addicted. I will try other flavors out of curiosity. I think you could doctor these up a bit on your own..maybe some lite Philly cream cheese and cayenne pepper and zap in micro just to warm.....or no sugar jalapenno jelly for some zip....."
5,Heart breaking!,"I loved this book very much! I read it aloud to my middle school students, and they were surprised to learn that orphans were transported across the country and sent to live with families who got to select an orphan to adopt when the train stopped in their town. My students felt a lot of empathy for the main character and expressed their concern for her. I recommend this book!"
1,Not useful at all for new or experienced owners.,"I found this book to contain mostly old, outdated and poor bar/business practices. There was nothing what-so-ever notable in this book. As an owner of successful bars,I believe that new bar owners will find that this book was a costly read."
3,Required History Reading if Opening a Bar,Why? This book gives you insight on how things worked before computers. This is good to know if your Point of Sale (POS) goes down or if you actually need to use pencil & paper to write inventories and things out. Well worth the money.
3,No so hot!,Found that if one makes a mistake while entering data one cannot delete the errors. Hence one has to start over then ends up with 2 copies ... one the 'blunder' and one the real copy. Pages print out on copious paper instead of it being on continuous 'feed'. So instead of having only 10 pages one ends up with 20 and having to initial and sign only a few lines on each page. Also found the information requested was very 'state' specific. If one had accounts located outside of the USA one was out of luck being able to enter the address correctly as the program ONLY accepted addresses in the USA.This is a pain if one has policies or business assets in other countries. I felt it was ... overpriced.
4,Insightful!,"If you work in human resources, the manual put together by editors Richard A. Swanson and Elwood F. Holton III will probably find its way onto a shelf close by your desk, where it can be easily reached as a reference tool. The chapters of this book, which were written by different authors but have been organized into a logical whole, help span the gap between theory and practice in the human resources field. You'll likely find yourself reaching for this dense, informative book every time your start planning a survey, training program or research project. If you're not in HR, this book is more likely to find its way into cardboard box on a dusty shelf at the back of a dark closet. The content, although quite innovative and detailed, is simply too specialized for a general readership. Therefore, we recommend this book to human resource professionals at all levels, and strongly encourage students of the discipline to study these pages before setting out in the real world of business."
5,Great fit and comfort,"Thank you for the quick delivery. These are very comfortable, I love the fit!! Thank you again, would definitely purchase from this seller again."
3,Pretty good,"I have always loved the cut of these sporty bikinis. However, it seems that Hanes has played around with the sizes in the last year or 2. These just don't fit the way they used to. They're not uncomfortable but they used to be better."
3,Not exactly what the doctor ordered!,"I ordered these for my 98 tacoma, I was removing the stock speakers I could then use these for the new ones, but they didn't fit, the plug in was totally different, I still used them, the wires at least, the main reason I wrote this review is so people will know they won't fit a 98 tacoma!"
3,front speakers only,FYI-this harness is not made for the rear speakers in 2007 Toyota Corolla. It will work fine for front speakers.
1,Lord Harry,"I've read 75% of Coulter's books and am working on 100% - however, this is her first book that I could hardly get thru. It has a good story line, but drones on and on and I found myself skipping pages just to 'get on with it'. Hetty and Jason don't even meet until half way thru the book - I kept wondering if they ever would. And, when they finally 'fall' in love, it was weak. The ending is a surprise, and not a welcome one, but there was no lead up whatsoever and it left a bad taste in my mouth. By that time, I was just glad to get to the end. However, I'll keep reading the last 25% of Coulter's books - I've enjoyed them up to now."
2,Yawn,"Improbable, boring and pointless. There is no way that slicking back her hair with pomade and binding her breasts could make a ""beauty"" appear to be a man and fool a whole town for 5 whole months. That's just ridiculous.The book didn't even feel like a romance novel. The characters barely interacted except towards the end. I am still trying to understand how you accept the proposal of a man after a few days, when you have been hating him and plotting his death for months.Worse CC book I have ever read. Only reason it didn't get 1 star was because I have recently read the Anita Blake series and this book at least had a detectable plot."
4,Pretty good,"catherine coulter is an amazing author.. even though some of her books are sometimes kind of 2-stared... but anyways, lord harry was a great book except the ending was too quick. a third rewrite to continue the book a little bit would be excellent~! also, SIR harry and that girl he was in love with (i forgot her name) deserve their own book~! i would love to see mrs. coulter write a book on those two. they are part of the reason i enjoyed the book so much.. very good book.. good humor (as usual~! :), great plot, and i loved the herione.. she was great and made me very proud to be a woman~!"
3,Great book until the end,"I loved the premise of the book, even the execution of most of the story, but the ending was choppy and a great disappointment. Almost like the author didn't have control over the editor cutting a huge section out of the end. It was sudden, abrupt, and totally unsatisfactory. I demand a third rewrite."
2,Not a Keeper,I was really disappointed with this book. The two characters are not aware of each other until almost the end of the book. Then the lead male character professes love for her without even really knowing her. This will go into my resell pile.
3,Badly Edited,"I have just finished reading the original version of this title, and I am incredibly disappointed that, when rewriting, the author or her editor did not correct the forms of address in this book. ONLY a Duke is addressed as ""Your Grace""! Lord Monteith would be Harry's father, not Harry!! If one is going to write material with an English background, at least TRY to get it correct. It irritated me so much that I had trouble finishing the title even though the premise was fairly good, and the standard of writing better than most."
1,Water Tech Blaster is a Buster,"Battery will not recharge after a few uses. Good idea, bad product. Customer service does not exist."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!,I have my own pool servicing business and bought this to have as a portable vacuum. It has terrible suction power and an incredibly small bag. The bag is very porous and you HAVE to purchase the fine mesh bag as an accessory. Doesn't function well on a pool pole either. Very poor buy!!!!
2,A Christie Mystery or Not?,"I'm not much of a mystery reader, but I've never read Agatha Christie and I wanted to, so thus, this book. I read the first fifty pages in a flash. This is not what I'd expected from Agatha, I thought. This is light reading. Lots of dialogue, minimal action.As I looked more carefully at the book, I found out why. Despite the enormous AGATHA CHRISTIE written on the front cover, Black Coffee, the book, was not actually written by Christie. It is derived from a play Christie wrote, but it was actually written as a book by someone else.So, have I read Christie or haven't I? I think not. I must still seek out a Christie for the whole experience. Black Coffee was watered down Christie."
1,Completely Shocked!,"Well, Osborne broke the fundamental, essential rule of mystery writing. Never give away the murderer, at least so early into the story.It's astounding. I kept expecting some kind of twist at the end to account for that ""slip up"" and was shocked to discover that there was none!Unbelievable."
3,"not a bad ""sequel"" but not a top-rate Christie, either","Not bad, but it definitely read like a play (not surprising, as it is based on an Agatha Christie play)."
4,Excitante novela de una gran escritora,"Se trata de una buena novela erótica de la más reciente novela española. Lulú puede ser un símbolo de un tipo de mujer moderna, libre e independiente, pero todavía con una gran inclinación a ser dominada, aunque sólo sea en la cama. El lector tiene garantizada su excitación sexual continua en cada una de las páginas de la obra. En cambio, no es en absoluto recomendable la película basada en la novela, que únicamente se ocupa del aspecto sensual, pero no de la evolución psicológica de la protagonista."
1,Narcissism & Adoption,"This book is awful. I found the first part of the book okay. The couple is incredibly naive as they adopt their first child, but surprisingly lots of couples are.The cringe factor increased with each paragraph about their search not for another child, but a sister for their first, perfect, beautiful daughter. The narrator quickly became a very unlikeable character. This couple seemed to have more money than sense & would stop at nothing to bring home a sister. Then when the perfect daughter didn't like her new sister, the author spends too much time regretting their decision. The author really never came across as wanting to be the mother of the second little girl. She seemed way too self-involved to notice some of the more obvious attachment issues & unwilling to work on those issues with the little girl. The book left me feeling like I need kiss, hug & reassure my daughter, that I love her & wanted her for her, not because of what she provides for her brothers.Ick."
1,errors,"Have you ever tried to value a Partial-time single asset barrier option (i.e. an up-and-out call type A with asset price S = 75, strike price X = 85, barrier H = 95, time to maturity t1 = 0.35, time to maturity T2 = 0.5, risk free rate = 10%, cost of carry = 5%, and volatility = 3%) If this is the value of this option, I would like to buy one :-). The formula yields a negative value! If you know what is wrong, mail me, please."
3,This book is only for lawyers,"The book only helps lawyers is is not designed for folks getting a divorce. I have recently read Louisiana Family Law Guide which gives good advice to all of us, not just lawyers."
4,Nice Upgrade,The old bags for our life jackets were very sunfaded and damaged. The new bags look great for a fair price.
1,CONFUSION GALORE!!,"I don't know what happened here but this CD really tanks!! As other reviewers here have noted its too overdone and the songs...well, lets just say...forget it!! Its a mass of confusion galore!!"
5,The Best of Reba!!,"This is Reba's best album! Reba has really showed off her talents in this album. Combined with the Enhanced CD, this an excellent CD and would recommend it to anybody! Any Reba fan who rejects this is not a true fan!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST CDS I'VE EVER HEARD!,"Again,if you like POP music, this CD will be right up your alley from the queen of ""bubblegum crossover pop""! Not one song on here appeals to me!! Its really quite awful. Just noise, that's all it is."
5,you gotta hear this!,"this is the best that she has had yet! I am not a Reba fan, but you gotta hear this!"
1,NOT GOOD!!,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst things Reba has ever done. Most of the songs are the typical pop flavored stuff that country music has become these days. Its too bad and its an irony too because back in the 1980s she revitalized the traditionalist movement along with George Strait and Ricky Skaggs. Why did she change?? To record stuff like this??? Awful!"
1,TOTALLY DROWNING IN ORCHESTRATION AND ARRANGEMENT!,"This CD as most of the other reviewers here have noted is sub par for McEntire. The material here is NOT worthy of her. One tune could have been a country classic ""Lonely Alone"" but she ruins it with a turn around on the bridge that shifts the song into a minor key and it kills the song!! What a shame..because it is one of the more country sounding songs on this mess which is saying a lot because most of these are full of loud electric guitars, synthesizers, overdone background vocals, and any other kind of instrument you can think of except what makes country country...the steel guitar, the dobro, the mandolin and the fiddle. I think Reba needs to change venues. She's overstayed her welcome in the pop arena."
5,Lovely papers.,"These papers are beautiful in design. They are a thick paper that takes folds well, though maybe not for very complicated origami. They are really beautiful in color and pattern, very bright."
2,Hum-Drum,"I found this book to be very superficial. There was no excitement - the only thing that kept me reading was to see what she did with the baby. I had the killer picked out halfway through the book. There was no exciting ending. It seemed to just plod onward and I was very glad to see it come to an end. Hopefully, her other series is better."
4,Enjoyable.,"This game came out during the big Real Time Strategy boom in the 90s, after ""Dune"", ""Warcraft"" and ""Warcraft 2"" and others inspired the genre. But ""Z"" was unlike all those other games in the following way; it dealt with a couple of robot armies vying to grab territory on a variety of planets. The main single player story revolves around three robots; two grunts who recklessly pilot a spaceship, and a general who pays homage to many an American movie general.It's an amusing diversion for a few hours. They key to winning is to grab patches of territory to inrese your manufacturing capability. In this way the game can be almost too easy at times, but there still are some challenges in it.It's not an outstanding game as such, but is fun. It's worked on every computer I've bought or built, so it has a kind of timeless quality to it, even if the graphics are a bit dated. If you have a hankering for an older game, and want something different in the RTS genre, you might want to give ""Z"" a try."
4,Wii-Connected,"When it comes to the Nintendo Wii, many gamers have wanted to fins the best ways of downloading games from the internet. Although you can definitely get it through a Wi-Fi router, some of them don't do the job, where you'd have to check with Nintendo. While there are also other ways besides router to get you to go online for your favorite downloads. This Lan adapter from Datel, the same company that developed the Action Replay is very simple and easy to install. You simply plug it into the back of your USB ports on the system, and connect it to your cable or DSL modem. Although it is simple to operate. it does a few problems when the system overheats. nevertheless, it is a good buy for anyone who has a broadband connection, and wants to play hard online with the Wii.Price: B 1/2-Convience: B-Overall: B-"
4,Lad Adapter Review,I use this Lan Adapter to hook my Wii up to the internet. It works perfectly. The cord is sort of short but does the job.
3,Easy Reading,"I liked this book and it was a very easy read. The story line kept my attention and with a low price, I would recommend."
4,"Wonderful, easy read","This story was wonderful and easy to read. I loved the whacky family in Georgia, and the way the author wove the characters together.I want more!!! I could see this as a movie."
2,Subpar essays,"If you think this book of essays is going to give you a new perspective on girls and raising a daughter, think again. Most of the ideas in this book are extremely trite. I was very disappointed."
3,PhotoMessenger 8,"My biggest complaint with the PhotoMessenger bag is its weight. Even before I put my camera equipment in the bag I noticed the fact that it was very heavy. I had two camera bodies and three lenses in it and it was very difficult to handle. I do like the fact that there is an easy access panel on the top. The expandable pocket on the back is also a nice feature. It is overall a nice looking bag, but it would serve better as a suitcast than a bag you can carry with you at all times. Definitely ot for a photographer who doesn't want a lot of things getting in their way."
4,Tons-A-Space,"Have been able to my Canon 20D, 70-300mm lens,Canon Elan,70-280mm lens, a 50mm lens, 580 and 430 flashes, Turbo Z,Epson P2000, all of chargers into the main compartments. Multiple cables, extra batteries, manuals, cleaning gear, and everything else required for a shoot. Love the room and all the little small pouches to stash stuff in. Only minor complaint is the number of zippers and buckles needed to access main bag. But I am anal and always zip and snap them and will never pick my bag up and have all fall out. Price was unreal. Buy it."
4,Better than HL2,"I had, and have, serious gripes with HL2. But overall this game is better and more enjoyable than the source, HL2. I love the low light areas, which offer a new sense of tension after the absurdly-easy final section of HL2.How is it that such an important game's sequel-to-the-sequel can seem more coherent, more like a real game (with a consistent and compelling storyline), than its original (the HL2 sequel to HL)? Sad to say, but this sequel makes the original seem even more lame than it did on its own."
3,Don't buy used!,Registry code will only work with one Steam account. Don't expect a used copy to work on a stranger's computer.
3,Enemic,"This is just an extension of the first HL2, not an expansion. In an expansion there is usually new features or capabilites. There is nothing new that I could see, just more of the same. The puzzles are not particularly clever. I played it on the ""hard"" setting just to make it challenging and it was still too easy in the end.When I played the original HL2, I was riveted to the thing, but since this was just more of the same, I was not eager to get back to it in between play.Save your money"
3,Half Life 2,The game was OK. I just don't like the steam interface. It constantly hangs up my computer every time I turn the computer on. It always wants to connnect and it slows down my computer. I will not be buying the rest of the series.
2,Don't Bother unless you feel like getting a STEAM burn,"Loved HL2 but that was when STEAM was only mildly annoying. Now the STEAM activation system has reached a whole new level of sadistic pain. I won't rehash what's been described below but suffice to say it takes longer to activate this game than play it. The game HL2 Ep 1 is OK but nothing new but hey who wouldn't rather spend 2 hrs trying to activate the game ala STEAM than play it. I think I'll pass on HL2 Ep 2 until Valve comes to their senses. In the meantime, if I want to frustrate myself I'll go back to trying to purge my system of all the STARFORCE subroutines (I can only imagine what STEAM has bugged my system with?)."
4,"Good for historical references, but to concentrated in the US systems.",Only as guidelines because today transportation changes to fast.Extremely well clarified and trim apart all the variables involved in transportation.
5,FUNNY Stuff! (a short review),"WARNING: these songs are catchy and will stick in your head! You will sing them in the shower and your family will think you have gone mad!I found this CD in the trash. Amazing what people will throw out these days! NOT a Bluegrass fan--progresive or otherwise--but I sure enjoyed the clever lyrics on this CD. Easy to listen to and gets funnier with each playing. Top notch musicians. Funny, funny stuff!Note to self: must stop dumpster diving, must buy Lizard CD's."
4,Die laughing...,"You know, any album with songs called ""Rasputin's HMO"" and ""40 years and old and living in Mom's garage"" has got to be good! These guys don't disapoint! I had heard a lot about them, and I checked out this release first and was pretty thrilled. It's probably the funniest album I've ever heard, and stands up to repeat listenings because the songs are so smart and well crafted. If you like Bad Livers, Lyle Lovett, or even Ween, you'll probably enjoy this disc"
5,Perfect food storage!!,I love these and will most likely buy more of them. They are much nicer than the plastic. Highly recommend!
5,I *love* these bowls!,"It took me a bit to get the first lid on because I was expecting it to *not* be airtight. I've not experienced exploding bowls, as some others have experienced, but I will update my review if I do have such an issue.I love the sizes. The 7-cup fits nicely into the yogurt machine, too."
4,Wish I could buy replacement lids!,This is a great set. Functional and convenient. It has one flaw. If you put the lids in the dishwasher they have a one year life span and then they crack up and you are left with the glass bowls only. I tried to buy replacement lids - I looked everywhere - basically you CAN buy lids but it will cost you more than the original set. I don't understand WHY Pyrex lids are so fragile. My mother has Tupperware that she has used and put in the dishwasher for 25 years and it has no cracks. If I could buy the glass Pyrex bowls with Tupperware quality lids I would be in heaven.
5,No Problem With Lid,"The lids are not as easy as plastic but it just takesdifferent handling; hook on front and push toward far side;to take off, push in center and pull from far side.On first use, wash bowl first with hottish waterand while you are washing lidthe bowl will have cooled a bit, so it shouldbe a little less expanded that the lid.Also, remember, when you put it in the refrigerator,the air inside will contract creating a slight vacuum.Very nice glass and I like the snug fit of the lids."
4,Great product but be careful in microwave,"An excellent and very versatile set of 3 glass bowls, good for transporting food, mixing sauces, even baking (something like a small cornbread). The lids are tight fitting and durable. Just be aware that the glass heats VERY hot in the microwave and this doesn't seem to be unique to my oven. I actually used one of the larger bowls to microwave (air pop) popcorn on a whim. I used no oil and set the timer for two (2) minutes. Popcorn popped really nicely but the glass was extremely hot to the touch even with oven mitts. It would be very dangerous for a child or even an elderly person to use these unsupervised. Again, just be aware and be sure to use mitts/towel when retrieving the bowl from the microwave."
3,I have to disagree,"I have a different opinion of these containers. They get incredibly hot in the microwave. One of the first things I did with them was to heat up some leftovers and I was very surprised by how hot the bowl gets it the microwave. Glass is a poor heat conductor and I would not expect a large amount of heat transfer during the 2 minutes it spent in the microwave. It was blazing hot, far to hot to touch. As a test I tried heating an empty bowl and sure enough, the bowl itself got hot after just a minute.These bowls are not all that tough either. Just this morning I discovered a broken bowl that I had used last night. The entire top half had popped off, all the way around. It was just sitting in the sink like that, all by itself. This was it's very first time in use.However, from a health perspective, it's far superior to plastic so it wins on that point. But functionally, only good, not great."
5,the Middle season 2,Excellent. One of my favorite shows and the DVD is excellent. The second season was just as good as the first. Very good family entertainment.
2,Yuck!,This show is weird. How can anyone like this weird show? Its just a pathetic attempt to copy Malcolm in the Middle. The characters are ugly and not funny.
1,Caller ID Memory --- yeah right!,"Okay, I love the fact that this has a dual alarm, but the caller ID on this phone simply does not work. I have had 2 of these and neither one has worked. I am not even sure that there is a decent phone/caller ID/dual alarm clock that works the way its supposed to."
2,If you can get it to run....,I spent three days on this project. I had the Studio DV Version 7 and downloaded from Microsoft and downloaded from Pinnacle and talked to support parties after waiting for 15 minutes. They didn't have much to say. Windows 98 recognized the IEEE1394 card. The Canon recognized that the firewire was plugged in. Somewhere it was missing because the software kept telling me 'unable to fine DV device to initialize.'... and thats the end of the story. All Pinn had to say was that maybe it was all incompatitble with the motherboard. Took it back!!! No more Pinnacle for me.
4,Pinnacle Studio on Sony Vaio,"I have used this software on a Sony Vaio desktop (1.5 GHz Pentium 4, Windows XP) with good results. The only change I made to the default settings was to use disk D for temporary storage. It hung up once, but the trouble was probably in Windows (I got the ""we're sorry"" popup); when I restarted Studio, I was able to continue from where I left off with no problems, so there must have been some kind of automatic save. The only other trouble was when I tried to put a title at the beginning the timeline when there was a video clip already on it; I had to delete the clip, and when I put it back afterward, the audio was out of sync. I like the fast rendering when sending the edited video back to the camcorder; if you don't change the content of a clip (length change is ok), it doesn't need any rendering at all. My camcorder is a Canon ZR10."
2,Beware hardware issues,"This software has garnered some great reviews, however...the installation routine crashed 3 times before I was successfully able to install the software. Then, it ran a diagnostic on my system and concluded my hard drive's read rate wasn't fast enough so the software couldn't work. I believe the minimum requirement was 7000 units of whatever.It's only recommendations: get a new hard drive or PC! My PC is only 18 months old, a P4 with plenty of adequate resources.To make matters worse, the software is rarely returnable once opened. So, make sure you know about the required resources and if your PC is equipped before opening the box."
2,Incomplete Update,"This second edition was not a thorough update, since the ideas in the text are still primarily supported by articles published in the 1980s and 1990s."
5,MOON MEDICINE,"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST WESTERNS, AND I LOVE WESTERNS, i HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MOVIE MADE."
5,Best of the Westerns!,"I am an author and first read this book to gain a little insight into details of western tales. I soon found the story and its characters bigger than life and the disctiptions of western life and travel compelling. I grew up in southern Colorado and northern Mew Mexico. The country comes out in vivid detail in much of Mike Blakely's writing.I recommend Moon Medicine and its companion, Come Sundown highly."
2,Mistakes ruin otherwise entertaining read,"This book was entertaining to read, but contained several mistakes which ruined the book's credibility. For example, the chapter on Garibaldi uses several wrong years for events in Brazil in the 1840's. Also, in the chapter on Che, it states that Fidel Castro was jailed for 15 years in 1952. He was sentenced to 15 years, but was released in 1955. I can understand spelling or grammatical errors, but cannot understand how errors like these were missed in editing and final review. I was disappointed by this book and I cannot recommend it to others."
4,Amazing product,"I'm truly amazed at how well this product works. It is worth the price. The only drawback is day one of its application, it leaves your underarms pastey. Other than that I love the product."
1,failed,"now that you asked,the producted failed to work and is just sitting in my cabnet.i just didn't have the time to send back.i do not recomend at all.do you want it back?"
1,Not anything close to what the reviews said,"I had high hopes for this product, but after I got over the pasty white residue that the product left, it didn't work, not even for an hour. I woudn't say that I have an overactive sweat glands or anything since regular strength deodorant has always worked fine for me, but this was terrible."
2,not recommended,"too simple and superficial . not that helpful since it is just too basic or not the point, only use couple times after I bought it."
3,"Eliminates birds, attracts dirt","I bought Tanglefoot last spring to deter birds from landing on and in my porch roof. The product works great at keeping the birds at bay. However, because it's basically a sticky goo it also attracts dirt. I'd rather have the birds at bay and if you strategically place the repellent it will be effective and out of sight. If I need to remove it some day I dread the task, but in the meantime no bird droppings to clean off of my deck."
3,The Passion Ruby,"The book was good...I would actually give it 3.5 stars. It's not something that I would normally read, but I was extremely bored when my friend let me borrow the book. While the overall storyline is kind of far-fetched and corny, the storyline of Sienna and Hawk's relationship is pretty intriguing. However, I must say that some of the lines during the love scenes were quite corny!"
1,Exhanged first broken one and now second is down...,I liked the combo phone/alarm/cd but found the product to be the worst quality of any home electronics I have ever purchased. Both the original and the replacement lost keypad functionality within a month of use making it impossible to dial out. Also both phones slowly lost all contrast on the caller id lcd so that you couldn't make out any display after a couple of months.Almost sure to break within a few weeks of light use.
5,Opens your ears,"These ""small band"" renditions of Mozart allow you to hear between the notes, new way to perceive these classics."
1,Broke on first use,"The very first time we tried to pull up a skier the handle of the rope hit the ski and shattered the tip. The manufacturer's conveniently unwritten warranty does not cover ""impacts"" so no refunds or replacements. In fairness, I found at least one water ski manufacturer that specifically excludes the rope hitting the ski so maybe it is industry standard. It seems like that event would be common and therefore accounted for in the design of the product."
4,British version of this single ...,"has a great ""b-side"", which is actually ""Metal"" by Gary Numan (one of his old and really good ones) reworked."
1,Beware problems with older computers?,"I own a gateway media center computer with a pentium D processor, running XP and 4 gigs of ram. I also have a 500 watt PSU, so there should of been no reason for this card to have any problems. Well, I went from a ATI to NVidia, which apparently is sometimes a problem. Anyway, the LCD monitor I had would not read the card on the first boot, so I would have to boot twice for it to work. I called EVGA and they told me they had no idea, that's right ""no idea"" why it's not working. They told me to just get a new card, so I did. The new 8600gt didn't work at all, so I reinstalled my old card which has no problem, and returned the 8600gt. I'm fed up! I gave it a 1 because zero isn't available, and you might have no problem with it."
2,A venture into the known.........,"In strict technical terms I suppose Journey Into Fear qualifies as film noir. For my likings though it's a stretch. The genius of Welles aside, the movie while providing much of the Noir technique lacks a bit of the heart and soul that defines it. Not that Journey has to be Noir, but the movie is dished up as such. A wet dark street in Nowhere USA with an embittered protagonist, well, I guess I can't get enough of that. To each they're own--I got tired of the boat and the weak protagonist Cotton early in the game. And the antagonist, could he have been more obvious? If your range for this era of film is far and wide, and you tend toward technique over mood, and over suspense, you'll probably be OK with Journey. It missed my target though."
4,Not the greatest of journeys,"Dark atmosphere and claustrophobic effects dominate this Orson Welles adaptation of the Eric Ambler novel about munitions smuggling in Turkey. It's spy vs. spy as a band of Nazi sympathizers attempts to bump off American dealer Joseph Cotten. The acting, mostly by Welles's Mercury Theatre gang, is very good, especially Cotten. The action, however, generally fails to build; even the chase scenes - one on the ledge of a hotel building in a driving rainstorm - seem uncharacteristically bland for Welles. Filled with quirky camera angles and stylistic experimentation, the movie still manages to disappoint in the long run: one expects more from this masterful crew."
4,"No credit, But you'd have to be pretty dim if you'd ever seen an","Orson Welles' movie before this one & not realize, he's all over it. A rather good but too short war thriller with Welles regulars. Welles is in it so is Joseph Cotten. He's Howard Graham, an American Engineer in World War II Turkey with lots of info, in his head. The Nazi are going to kill him. They don't want him to be replace too quickly. Maybe delay him for a while, then kill him. We know the assassins, but the suspense is still there. How does Mr. Graham get out of it? Early noir before it had a name."
1,pitiful results,"Mystified by these comments. I just spent 40 minutes with this product trying to clean a tarnished, in parts blackened, copper tea kettle. I will now try another method or product."
5,Great banner!,This is a great banner. I fly it with pride from my porch column every Sunday during football season. Go Ravens!!!!!
2,"Uncomfortable...microphone, decent sound","Uncomfortable, below average microphone, decent sound...Bass and treble is decent, but nothing extraordinary.These headphones are BIG and the headband can be a bit uncomfortable -- especially after long use.The microphone [is bad]. I played a few PC games using these headphones and almost no one could hear what I said (yes, all my PC settings were correct).I wouldn't recommend these headphones. Look elsewhere."
1,Compact Editions should be labeled as such in the main title,"This is a compact edition of a great book. Don't order it since it is only the size of a CD case. The pictures are very small and if you are purchasing this book to appreciate the incredible artwork of Eva Zeisel, make sure that the seller isn't giving you the compact version."
3,Very popular lately,"This is pretty standard stuff on what the church is and the place of the ministry in relation to the place of all believers in Christ. It reads like a lot of other dogmatic treatments on these things and echoes what one finds in the Small Catechism. There is not much new ground here. It has become popular in recent years because of controversies within the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod over the roles of pastors and laity. It is a necessary historical and biblical benchmark, but it is not very exciting reading. I bought a copy for a presentation I had to make, but I also found it very easy to give it away later."
5,Fantastic Recording Quality,"This was a great record when it originally came out and is a great CD. Pick it up while you can get it. The recording quality is absolutely outstanding. If you like early to mid 80's rock, this is a must have in your collection."
2,sloppy technology,"Bit of a letdown. There seem to be a few versions of the Trinity movies going around, many poorly transferred to DVD. Picture quality here was poor (even some ghosting in parts) and yes, the brilliant blue eyes are really not well seen! Sound is analog too, if you can believe it. Sadly, the movies have dated too: innovative then, it's all been done so many times now.."
2,bsic screening,"This text was written years ago but still contains intersting historic information. ""The Management of Aircraft Maintenace"" I found to be more up-to-date on the actual management of aircraft maintenance visits. $89.00 612-915-1598 or fax: 612-929-7208"
4,Smart buy,"Cheaper, rough and tough it's an ideal item for sporting and fitnes. I recomand this watch"
3,Unrealistic,"Although this book was interesting, it did not offer any practical advice on how to solve problems with siblings. We are blending two families, with 3 children in each, and we felt this book did not offer good, applicable problem solving techniques. It was more of a ""feel good"" book, which dealt more with the idea of ""we did it"", instead of tackling the real issues of ""how we did it""."
4,Enjoy myself,"Maxine Sullivan is a master. Unvarnished, not over stylized, just damn good music recognized and respected by a pro."
4,America by Train,I used this to help plan my Amtrak trip of over 7000 miles around the USA. It was very helpful. It also provided useful information as my trip proceeded.More detailed maps would have been useful.
2,lame,This video is lame.All it shows is the girls working out and telling everybody about their boring lives.Save your money.
1,Star Trek: Armada 2,"Save your money, this game is a dog. It couldn't carry A1's lunch-box. If you liked Armada 1, you will really be shocked at how bad this game is. It reeks from top to bottom..."
3,Great Size ... No Support?,"I love the size. I had a 17"" monitor until the picture blew, but this 19"" seems so much larger.I do have one bad thing to say. The picture size could not be adjusted to suit my needs. I can expand the image to fill the screen using the monitor controls, but it lacks all the controls required to get it to look right. The left side of the image goes from the edge at the top to the edge at the bottom. The right side goes from about 1/8"" from the top to about 1/8"" from the bottom.That is too bad, as I can live with this minor flaw... But my email to Envision about the problem has gone unanswered. Do they not read their email, or not care about the customer?"
1,DISTORTION!!,"I got the Envision 910e 19"" monitor a week ago. Today I am packing it up and taking it back. Can't get rid of the picture distortion no matter how I adjust it. If you are sensitive to screen distortion I'd recommend spending a bit more, this sort of thing really bothers me."
4,Fascinating Book,"This book is not only a wonderful look at the fascinating men who were obsessed with reaching the North Pole, but with the fascination that unknown lands have on the human imagination. I was impressed with how foreign the concept of the North Pole was until it was reached. It was as mysterious to people back then as Mars is now, if not more so. Some theorists believed a whole other world was located in the center of Earth, accessible only by the Pole, and which housed a whole different race of people. The hardships that these men willingly endured just to be able to put their flag up and name a spot on the map and for the glory of it, simply amazed me. A terrific read without a slow spot in the whole thing. On top of it Fleming is a terrific wordsmith who has a really funny take on things at times. Get it."
5,Great Book for Pros & Students,"I love this book. It's honest, open and thought provoking. I've been in the design business for 7 years and I found this book refreshing. I passed the book on to our department intern and before I knew it our entire department had read the book. We all agree, it's a must read!"
1,A waste of time and money,I bought this book because of the positive reader views - what a let down. The book is poorly written and unrealistic. It's not that the premise in unbelievable - the author just doesn't do any thing with it. He promised that the story would make me think - it did: I shouldn't have wasted my time or money.
4,An entertaining and quick-paced read.,"I really enjoyed this book, and thought the premise was interesting. The military hardware described was great, and I think the characters have great potential in the upcoming series. I particularly liked the political angles of the series-- and found the battle scenes engaging. I'll be waiting for book 2....."
5,This is THE World War III Book,R.L. Muehlberg has created the ultimate World War III book.I felt like I was there.It pits Quebec and United Europe against Canada(Very Weak) and the United States(Also weak).The Asia-Pacific Confederation stands by and threatens Nuclear War. This book has a lot of true Americans fighting the Un-Americanlike President.It almost turns into the Second Civil War.I can't wait for Fate Lauging(the sequel)to come out
2,Far from Clancy,"While I enjoy a number of Techno-adventure books -- I found this one to be less than stellar. Compared to Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, I found this author to depend more on quoting military hardware terms rather than weaving a comprehensize plot. With all the other good writer on the market -- pass this book by."
1,wrong item pictured,"I am sure that this is just an oversight on the sellers part, however, the item pictured (9403 as I later found out) is not the one being shipped (the 9402). I know this seems petty, but I am paying over eight bucks shipping for an item which is not the one pictured. beware"
2,Ok GAME,Complete copy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. Only difference; the tricks but they are still almost identical. Also much harder.
4,Good book,Not the best book by this author but good none the less. a must have for all those necroscope junkies like me.
5,"Necroscope ""rocks""","Well...maybe ""rocks"" isn't the best word, or then again, maybe it is. I love all the stories of this series. My ONLY complaint is that there are not more of them in the making (or are there?). I didn't particularly care for the ending, only because it smacks of a kind of finality that might indicate no sequels. Not that it wasn't good...just hoping there are more to follow. If you liked the others, you'll like this one also."
2,"ok for the timid, but...","I bought this book from a used book store to bolster my library of african cookbooks (of which, until recently, there are precious few). In general, I found the book a disappointment. The author uses too many packaged foods and cuts spice levels to the point that the dishes are bland facsimiles of themselves, almost unrecognizable. There are other dishes which hardly qualify as african: roast beef, for example.When it was first published, the author's changes were no doubt welcomed by timid american cooks. now that our palates have become more sophisticated, we must demand more authenticity from ""ethnic"" cookbooks. Other african cookbooks deliver. This does not."
3,This book/cd is out of print,"and is no longer supported by the company that produced it. It is good only for older computer systems, read the specs, windows 3.1 or macintosh 7.It's a good book/cd but is not New."
3,Printer not recognizing it well,"The cartridge was working ok at first, but then the Printer said it was empty and didn't work again. I tried cleaning it and it worked for a while but again it says its empty...really frustrating"
3,OVER-HYPED!!,"I BOUGHT THE GAME AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING FOR 2 MONTHS, JUST TO GET HOME AND FIND OUT IT IS AN OVERINFLATED VERSION OF SEGA GT. FOR A GAME THAT GOES 60 FPS I'M NOT IMPRESSED. I RAN IT ON A INTEL PENTIUM 4 1500MHZ W/ 512MB RAM, AND WITH A NVIDIA GEFORCE3 TI200 CARD. LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER FAILED ATTEMPT TO COPY NEED FOR SPEED. THE MORPHING IDEA, WHAT A BUNCH OF (...). MY 5 YEAR OLD SON HAS A PLAYSTATION ONE WITH BETTER GRAPHICS AND FRAME RATE THAN THIS GAME. LOOKS LIKE I'LL GO BACK TO EA GAMES. ACTIVISION STILL THINKS IT IS IN THE 80'S ARCADE BUSINESS."
1,glorified nonsense.,"At first glance its very impressive flick--races,surviving skills, hot chicks etc till I realized it glorifies violence in all forms, gives some skin for well known reasons and thats the end of producer's imagination. Since when glorifying violence has any purpose?-- Since producer has nothing to say--thats my answer. Killing people for no reason is nothing new--just read about ancient Rome's gladiators shows so I guess the message is we didnt move anywhere on evolutionary line. We didnt."
3,"Action Fans, It's Worth a Watch","Death Race 2 offers a decent amount of fighting and racing. The characters and storyline are for the most part ordinary. This movie is more like a game in which you care more about the weapons and maneuvers than the characters. The end of the movie is engaging and very well acted by Luke Goss.The main character, Carl Lucas, is a contradiction. He walks the line between unbelievable and sympathetic. The female characters are insignificant to the story except to flash their breasts.Luke Goss and Danny Trejo are the highlights of the movie. Danny Trejo's acting is so real you forget he's playing a part. The underlying emotions of Luke Goss's character are almost tangible. His performance makes Lucas human rather than a game character you don't care about. Goss and Trejo make this movie worth watching."
3,Death Race 2 unrated.,The movie arrived when on the 31st of Oct like it was supposed too. We were pretty excited to watch it. At the end of the movie it started skipping we are pretty unhappy about that!!Thanks Gretchen
4,"Misleading title, but good film","It didnt dawn on my that this was supposed to be a prequeltho not sure why they decided to name these in a non chronological orderI think the best part was the end... because it wasnt really an endthe whole movie seemed to be made to lead up to the Jason Statham version. I guess it was meant to fill some holes in ""Death Race"""
5,Death Race 2,"This movie was in aspect similar to the sequel to the 2009 Independent Horror flick Paranormal Activity. In that even though both were sequels, the events that took place showed things that ocured before there originals. I highly enjoyed this film. It showcased a great deal of action, carnage, explosions, and general mayhem, and I highly recommend it."
4,Value for money,"Built up from various examples in self-contained concise chapters, this books gives a number of ideas for modelling different subjects.Some confidence in Maths is presumed."
2,disappointed,One pot does not heat like the other. This made for very lumpy chocolate and ruined my surprise.Very cheap material. Broke one of the utensils unwrapping the plastic from around it.
2,Poor quality,"Works ok but plastic is very cheap and aluminum pans are like Barbie set, they bend so easily, will not last too long, but let this be one time use disposable"
2,Blechh...,"I admit.....I purchased this book out of morbid curiosity as to what takes place after we die. The whole process of autopsies for unattended deaths, etc.. This ""educational book"" seems as if it were written for elementary school kids. ......ZZZZZ...ZZZZ..ZZ, WHAT A SNOOZER! It's published in big print with uninteresting photos, and the content is more along the lines of something you might read in a pamphlet. Cautiously informative with great care taken to NOT show anything ""gruesome"" or ""offensive"". Well, it's A BOOK ABOUT AUTOPSIES. Autopsies are indeed gruesome and offensive, it's dead people. Dead people who are cut open and systematically eviscerated for scientific purposes. So...if you are like me and was wanting something to quell your curiosity regarding what happens in autopsies, you will not get your answers from this book. At all."
3,much more simplistic than I had anticipated,"Interested in forensic anthropology, I imagined _Postmortem_ would be a detailing of forensic pathology, given the credential of the authors (one has a Master's in Public Health and PhD, the other an MD and JD.) Instead, to my dismay, I found the book a very general and simplified explanation of the chain of custody of death investigators and what their respective roles and jobs are.Given the vocabulary, organization and material, I imagine the book is primarily geared towards middle-schoolers (ages 10 - 14). The material isn't bad or inaccurate, or even poorly written - for its intended audience, it is appropriate (perhaps even a bit graphic - there are images of GSW - gun shot wounds, electrical burns and the foaming associated with drowning), but it is not nearly as sophisticated as I hoped it would be. Caveat emptor."
4,Great Book to bad my paperback copy fell apart,Great book packed with some super images of US Military Patches. The only problem is the binding glue failed and the pages are falling out. I wish I would have bought the HC.
4,Very Helpful,"Being someone who has CFS, this book was very helpful in dealing with it. It taught me many things to try to overcome CFS. The book was easy to read, not technical like other ""medical"", ""self-help"" books. If you have CFS or just low energy, I would recommend this book to you and to your loved ones."
5,Minichamp II pocket knife,A great little knife and has all the features I need while camping. With all the goodies in one package it keeps me from having to pack more things and that means less weight to carry. The pen is a nice touch. I always forget to have one around.I will use this extensively.
5,Great little knife,"I have purchased several of these knives, and obviously think they are great. It containes all the ""emergency"" tools I need in a nice compact size. The phillips screw driver is not quite small enough to use on eyeglasses, but I intend to make it work buy reducing the size with my diamond whetstone, and to flatten the cuticle tool into a small chisel. Additionally, I have flattened the blade surface to accept a razor type edge, and I use it for whittling small pieces of wood. It's a shame the airlines view this small knife as a weapon, but it easily fits into my checked luggage."
5,Incomparable texto,"Eventos del Porvenir constituye uno de los libros de estudio de la escatología como pocos, enseñando doctrinas totalmente biblicas. Altamente recomentado."
1,Just Awful!!!!,"I found these cheese snacks just terrible.... they smell like dog treats and taste like, what i would imagine... dog treats to taste like.. I whole-heartedly implore you to avoid these snacks."
1,One star is too many.,"If you thought you liked Cedric, think again before viewing this one. Shallow, dumb and just plain rank. This one is nothing like the barber shop movies. No comparison."
1,Wack&a Forgetable Trip,I'm a Huge Cedric the Entertainer Fan. Loves me some Vanessa Williams.Vanessa Williams is a Juicy Foxy mama yes LAWD!! but this Film is a barker.no Charisma or depth. makes you miss the Chevy Chase Versions of these Films&It's been ages since He has counted. this Clunker wears out it's charm before it gets out on the road.what a waste of Talent? Cedric ain't had funny stuff since He was on the Steve Harvey show&also on His Stand up Routines.Tv&Film ain't been kind to His Skills.
4,Olive Picks,"Was happy to find these, I had a set and one was broken. The price was good and the product was shipped quickly."
5,"Good brakes, easy install",This is a good product has everything you need to install. Fast and easy to install. Easy to adjust to fit rims.
3,She married him for the lifestyle,"I have read this book more than once, and do not agree with the one reviewer who states that it is a ludicrous piece of work. I think it's great but...The former Sheri Heller, now Baroness Sheri de Borchgrave, obviously meantnot to speak about her fears for the breast operation over the telephone because she had an inkling the Baron then would not wish to carry on with the wedding plans. He was correct to accuse her of that. She should never have married him, and then to stay with him after he began his cruelmistreatment? Come on, people! She really enjoyed that nobel lifestyle!If she didn't, why did being called Madame la Baronne tickle her? Why didshe go into length about the lofty titles of Belgium, the descriptions of the castles, and the many course meals with fine wines and all that?Sheri knew what she was doing when she snagged her Baron; it was just veryconvenient for her when he died and left her the Baroness for life!"
2,Dumb it down for me please,"This book is very clinically written but then again the author was Freud. I fall asleep reading this book. I wanted to understand the meaning of dreams in a simpler way but this didn't help at all, sorry Freud."
3,"When he stays on topic, Savage is very funny","When he is talking about sex, Savage is one of the funniest and most entertaining advice columnists out there. Unfortunately, you gotta take the bad with the good with this book. The author's sizeable ego infects every page, and his lack of experience and knowledge about, well, life outside the bedroom does tend to detract from the quality of his advice and overall writing.Still, all in all, I would recommend the book. It does entertain, and if you don't take it too seriously, you'll enjoy it."
3,Issues with the handles,Nicely designed furniture but there are assembly issues. The handles are attached on the inside of the drawers and doors for transit. The screws are cheap and over tightened. We bought 7 pieces of this furniture line and had issues with 5 of them. One screw broke and two had to be drilled out on three pieces.
1,Wrong Product!!!!!!!!,"Amazon's Tool to select front ball joints for 2000 F250 superduty diesel trucks is wrong. I had to return this and the matching; K8695T are wrong. I returned them, worked with Moog to find the correct parts and reordered them."
4,One of the great personalities of the Jazz Age!,"Wow! Ever since I've watched a few Cliff Edwards movies, I've gotten addicted to his voice. The song selection on this CD is good, and is really a great tribute to him. Still, I was dissapointed to not find the song Night Owl on it. I thought it was really a catchy tune and I would have loved it to be on this CD. It was a song from a musical called Take a Chance, with him(Cliff Edwards), James Dunn, Lillian Roth, June Knight, and Charles(Buddy)Rogers. It's a good movie other than Pinocchio of Edwards's."
4,"Swiss quality, just one thing missing","I am a big SAK fan and truly appreciate the quality of their stuff and ingenuity. Every thing on this has worked great since I bought this about a year ago and is still working perfectly. If I did not expect so much out of them I would give this five stars but I have one complaint. I think that they could have been able to fit in some tweezers even with the light on that side. Other than that, it is truly an excellent thing."
5,Mandatory Reading for Social Workers,"Speaking as a child abuse defense attorney, life would be much easier if social workers would learn the mistakes they can make resulting in false disclosures of child abuse. My job would be much easier if the results of these interviews were more reliable. This book shows how and why social workers need to use proper interview techniques. It's a great book from a defense attorney's standpoint to cross-examine a social worker with, but if every state mandated this book as training for social workers in the first place, we would have fewer cases in the system, and more reliable evidence."
5,Best book for current interview protocols,"I wish I had read this book the first day it came out. Very good protocols. Very effective strategies. Speaking as a law enforcement investigator assigned to these cases almost exclusively, there is not a better book I've found yet."
5,A much need addition to the literature,"The issue of spirituality has often been neglected in the multicultural counseling literature. Often spirituality is mentioned in an anthropological sense - a static fact you have to contend with. Fukuyama and Sevig have written this book to acknowledge the fact that spirituality is a living, dynamic factor that is essential to understanding people from diverse backgrounds. They point the reader towards ways to integrate spirituality into multicultural counseling by their use of case studies and self-reflective questions. The authors present the material in a flexible open-minded manner that allows for a variety of experiences. Rather than offering definitive answers Fukuyama and Sevig help the reader ask all the right questions. I highly recommend this book."
2,Great Router---if you love lag (on Cable),"I needed a router, who doesnt, right? I picked this thing up for a great price, but I wish I would have put in a few more bucks. For AT&T Broadband, formerly Excite@Home, the lag is unbearable. Webpages takes a approx 4 to 5 times longer to load up with this router compared to a direct connection. Why pay 50/month on highspeed internet if webpages load up as quick as dialup? I soon thereafter purchased a Sohoware Broadguard router, and it works EXTREMELY quick, feels like a direct connection. I ended up gaving the D-link router to my brother who has DSL, and it runs very quick, the way I would have liked for it to work on my cable connection, oh well, I guess cable and the D-Link 804 dont mix."
1,Unreliable -- dropped connections -- returned it,"The DI-804 installed ok. However, the set-up wizard did not work as well as it should for cloning a MAC address like my ISP requires.The DI-804 worked to get my home network up and runnning. However, it failed to be able to maintain connections with my PC during any length of time spent using the internet. After some use, it would just drop the connection with my PCs.I tried to contact D-Link via email. They were not responsive, just sending out a note to upgrade the firmware. I did that and it didn't help. I sent back a reply that it was still not working. They did not reply.I am returning the product to Amazon and taking the hit on the shipping charges. Ten dollars and 10 hours of wasted time."
2,Easy Setup But Lacks Features,"I purchased this router a week ago. The configuration and setup only took me 5 minutes. But this router doesn't allow me to set the port that I would like to be able to access. Instead it gives you a choice of service ports (ie HTTP, FTP, mail, etc.) that you can leave outside the firewall. There is also one other problem I've encountered. The router seems to stop responding after 48 hours of use. I have to power cycle the router in order to get it to respond.Had I known this, I would have purchased a Netgear or Linksys model."
5,A work of art,"This is a beautiful and unique book; the photography and printing are outstanding, and the images of the beetles are simultaneously gorgeous and bizarre."
3,extraordinarily beautiful but TOO big!,"This is an incredibly beautiful picture book with HUGE closeups of beetles. Since I am an entomologist & artist, it is easy to see why I bought it. However, I am not sure what audience this was aimed for. There are only six pages of text at the beginning that serve as an introduction to the beetles and the rest of the book is all photographs. Some of the photos show a whole beetle on one page and a detail of its body on the facing page, and most of the details were not terribly interesting. I never thought I could say that pictures of gorgeous beetles could be TOO big, but I think that is the case with this 10 x 13 1/2 inch book!"
4,does the job,bought these to replace a pair that broke for a college football player I work with. they did the job.
2,Hard to improve on the original,"I purchased a several different brands of orange peelers, this one did not work for me as well as the Tupperware versions. It sure is hard to improve on such a simple and useful device. This one does help you peel oranges but not as well."
3,Informative but opinionated,"This came highly recommended to me by my Mom, who used one of the original versions. Even she was a little disappointed. I would like it if it were a little more sensitive to the less than perfect mom."
2,Reunited,"Rosie Wright and Lemar Reed story was missing do much, the story spoke more about Lemar good for nothing friend Eddie, her house design (a lot about the award that she was trying to get but that die down out) her sister and unborn child the baby father their problem. Then we had Rosie problem about her and Lemar, her and any male, trust.This book left so much untouch."
1,not even same cap,I can't tell you whether or not the cap in the picture is great up close and in person because THE PERSON I ORDERED IT FROM MAILED ME THE WRONG CAP!!!!
4,Good News!,Purchased this bible because of the size (it wasn't pocket sized) and the cover was imitation leather. It might as well have been paperback. Next time I would chose a hard cover.
3,Good News Bible Large Print Edition,"This Bible falls midway between being a literal (word-for-word) translation and one which uses the dynamic equivalent (modernizing and contextualizing a word or phrase) method. The reading level is suitable even for children and helps the message to come alive for everyone rather than being partially concealed by traditionalist/archaic wording. The typeface is very legible even in low light, but I actually miss the line drawings in other editions. The binding is paperback and there is no more-substantially bound large print edition available. This translation has the advantage of an exhaustive separate concordance being available, at least via the United Kingdom, unlike a number of other contemporary translations. I would rate this item as five except for the insubstantial binding and lack of drawings as well as some of the study helps in other editions of this translation."
5,Good News Bible in Large Print,"I ordered this Bible as my sight seems to be declining. It is layed out exactly as the regular print, except it is larger in size and the bigger print - works great for me. Matter of fact, I bought a second for a family member."
2,Not much there,"I'm sorry to say that I can't agree with the earlier reviewers. I was expecting to see plenty of detail about the development of permissive action links, handling procedures, and the personnel reliability program. Instead, I was treated to a long overview of the author's military career. A bit light on detail for my taste.In my humble opinion, readers seeking lots of technical and procedural information would enjoy The Angry Genie, The Logic of Accidental Nuclear War, or Managing Nuclear Operations."
3,Works,"This item has been discontinued, probably because it is not compatible with newer Blackberry phones and is a bit quirky with the older models. It does work with a Blackberry Curve 8703e. I had to download the driver from Think Outside. I am using operating system version 4.2.1.106.The cradle is practically worthless and the arrow keys often get mixed up. Right turns into Up, etc. The cradle just collapses when I try to use it. A coffee cup works better. Sometimes the unit types gibberish. Reconnecting usually clears up the problem.There is a slight lag when I start typing, but otherwise it can keep up with me. I need to reconnect each time I use it and re-pair when I put in fresh batteries. I got it on clearance for $50, so I think I got a good deal. I use it almost every day. It fits in a standard pants pocket, but I had to relocate my wallet to my back pocket."
4,"If you like one of these pieces, this album's for you...","In my humble opinion, this is not the best colleciton of pieces, but the recordings are all made and executed well. A good value for the money."
5,A wonderful piece,"this item was awesome, I ordered it for someone special, and it really made a perfect giftthe hole for adding water may be too small, but a funnel helps with the filling of the chamber. The rainbows really fill the room.if you like small ornaments that put out alot of rainbows, this is the best thing you will find(I waas searching for hours for the perfect rainbow maker"
4,Baking sheets,"worked great, large enough for 9"" pans, too Had to cut to fit 8"" pans, but this was no problem. Will definitely use again."
2,Sticked to my cake!,"I thought it was a very unique and time saving product but it didn't deliver very well when put to use. Along with this purchase I also bought the OvenStuff Non-Stick 9 Inch Round Cake Pan Two Piece Set and something went wrong... The parchment paper didn't fit inside like it should've due to the size. Either the pans have the wrong 9 inches or the parchment paper does, either way I only know of one 9 inch and this wasn't it. The parchment also stuck to my cake, not the pan but the actually cake it was really frustrating because I had to shave all the pieces of parchment paper off my good cake. I will use the remaining parchment papers but I won't buy this product again."
1,Disappointed in these.,"Apparently the makers of my 9"" pans and the makers of these 9"" sheets didn't use the same kind of ruler, because I had to trim the sheets and felt like I might as well have cut parchment paper from the roll, which was just what my lazy self was trying to avoid. I also find that every parchment paper I have tried other than Reynolds and Wilton sticks to the bottom of my cakes, and this was no exception. Boooo! I was so excited to find pre-cut rounds, but these just didn't work for me."
2,too big to be useful,"These liners sounded like a great idea ~ unfortunately they're cut too large to fit into a 9"" round cake pan! the extra time it takes to trim them down could just as easily been given to cutting waxed paper or parchment at a lot less cost. i can't recommend them and won't be reordering, that's for sure."
2,Not so much...,"I ordered these for a new recipe I wanted to try. The recipe told me to butter the pan, put this down & then the cake. When the cake was done, cooled & friged overnight, I removed from the snap pan & the parchment was stuck to the cake. When I pulled it up slowly, cake chucks came with it. Not sure what I did wrong but I think I would have been better off not using the parchment. I will update my review if & when I use the parchment for another recipe."
1,Don't Waste your money,"I sent this basket to my mother as a gift and she was very disappointed. The portions were small and the products were not good. She threw many products away. I have sent other baskets in the past, and this definitely ranked near the bottom. This product did not meet my expectations in any way."
4,Some Copeland and Little Families Review,I found this book to be very informative about the Copeland and Little Famliy tree. The historical aspect of where and how the families started is well covered. Amazing on how well it covered my families history.
2,very disappointed,This CD costs more thsan most. I love celtic music and own alot of it. This all sounds the same. Not alot of variety.
5,Brilliant!,"Margaret Cho can't really be called a stand-up comic; to slap such a narrow label on her wouldn't do justice to her remarkable story-telling ability, her talent for sharing tales that are alternately sidesplittingly hilarious and unbelievably heartbreaking. I've seen her perform and read from her book five times in the past two years, because she's so entertaining and enlightnening. Any woman who's ever struggled with self-image issues (which is EVERY woman), anyone who's ever been ... on and ... off should buy this DVD. Because I said so."
2,Not her best,Not Margarets' best. Her HBO special was much better. Still funny but I think I expected more. It was too serious in parts and I think it has too many lulls.
1,A Disappointment,"I really was disappointed by this book. Normally I think that Lowry is very funny, but this book really could have been better."
1,The Way I Don't Recall It,"This book should come with a warning label that it is mediocre family history wrapped in up politically correct sociology. It probably does validate the experience of too many readers who grew up (or have lived)under circumstances of psychic pain, but for the rest of us who immediately recognize and appreciate what Coontz says has never existed, the book is a wordy agenda for adaptation to social decline. Hint: I am from the government and here to help you."
2,Read before you buy!,"The dvd is only 30 minutes ""short"". The music - piano desperately needs to be tune, and the teacher's english is hard to understand. Poor production and over price. When she sing, you can sometimes hear her spit at the microphone. The only good thing about this dvd is her chinese language. Again, it's only a 30 minutes dvd!"
5,101 Trees Of Indiana,"A very functional field guide that covers basic tree information in an easy to follow format. The keys, colored pictures and descriptions are great."
5,A Report on Today's State of the Art,"Surrogate Tissue Analysis, which strangely enough doesn't usually work with tissues, is a relatively new field where research is proceeding at a very rapid pace. So rapid, that even peer reviewed papers are in short supply. In this book, the authors, both active researchers in the field have written (four articles) or selected 18 articles written by researchers from around the world.That makes this book just about the only choice for an introduction to the field. It is broken into five sections: Introduction, Genomic Approaches, Proteomic Approaches, Metabolomics and Other Approaches, Future Considerations. As such, it summarizes the field, reports on very recent research and gives some indications where research will be going in the next few years.Besides the technical aspects, the book also reports on regulatory considerations, economic impact, and strategies in other '-omics' that may lead to new research areas.This is the state of the art as it exists today."
4,Lovely music and production,"I think Britten handled Shakespeare very well here, and I only wish he had set other Shakespeare plays into opera. The mechanicals were very funny and I thought the lovers quite convincing, though not teenagers. Britten seemed to trust children in his operas as his career went on; here the fairies are all children (except Oberon and Titania) and Puck is especially tricky as a little boy. I thought Cotrubas was a very effective Titania and wished that a recent production of the play I saw (not the opera) had such an imperious fairy queen. I was not crazy about the Oberon, but it was Britten's choice to have a high male voice for the part, for good dramatic reason, to stress his difference from humans; but I found the voice to lack power. Others have said they did not like the woods, but I found them quite magical and for me, they worked very well, giving a rustling magical forest feeling. The mechanicals are funny and their opera within an opera is silly and touching."
2,Not a good fit,"They didn't fit all that well into the slots, requiring me to cut the edges to make them fit. Installed in an '08 Sentra."
2,Disappointment,"I am a collector of McFarlane Action Figures and especially those of New York teams. I was disappointed to receive this particular one because of face discoloration and portions of the body had some paint scaling on it. I don't know what caused this to happen, but it should have never been sold this way!"
4,"Parallel dimensions, vampire societies, spies, great read!",Stumbled on Lumley's trilogy while searching for somethingelse. Became intrigued with Blood Brother's synopsis socarried it home for a read. Finished the book in two days and moved on to number 2 and 3 in the trilogy in short order. It has been 2 1/2 weeks and all three are done and I wonder who will take me on another quest with Noah and friends??..or one like it...Never read Necroscope series so am headed there now..hope it ranks up there with this series though I do not know how Mr. Lumley can expand my horizons any further or give me more pleasure than he already has.
1,It ... cuts wood... just not cleanly.,"I really liked that this blade was a .110"" kerf design with a high tooth count for $48. Wasn't even expecting a mirror smooth cut, but the sawmarks and tearout I'm getting with this blade are worse than my Irwin 12"" 24 tooth framing blade. After making a few test cuts in pine and confirming that it was installed correctly and not missing any teeth, I removed it and reinstalled my 24 tooth Irwin blade. Confirmed that the Irwin cut quality wins. Quality of cut didn't change no matter how fast I fed the blade, but I noted that this does cut pretty fast for a 90 tooth. I had high hopes for this blade. Possibly it can be reground by a sharpening service into something usable. I have another brand of blade, a 60 tooth, that *is* missing teeth and doesn't make sawmarks and tearout as bad as this Hitachi blade does. Severely disappointing."
5,A must for all sci-fi fans,"I was unaware this book was out of print. A new, revised edition was released in 1989, which included extensive footnotes by Le Guin, including an interesting redux of her essay, ""Is Gender Necessary?"" regarding the feminist content of her most famous novel, ""The Left Hand of Darkness.""In whatever version, ""The Language of the Night"" is, quite simply, essential reading for any devotee of science fiction and fantasy literature. Among the standout pieces are ""The Child and the Shadow"" and ""Myth and Archetype in Science Fiction,"" both of which use Jungian psychological ideas to get at the root of fantasy's imaginative power. Also compelling are ""Science Fiction and Mrs. Brown,"" in which (by way of Virginia Woolf's essay ""Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown"") Le Guin examines whether science fiction literature can really do justice to human character, and the hilarious ""From Elfland to Poughkeepsie,"" a delightful critique of tone-deaf fantasy authors.All in all, an excellent read."
3,Randall Renegade,"This was the first intrigue story for the Randalls and it didn't seem as well written but still if you like the Randall series, here is part of the story."
2,"a curious melange of material, not entirely effective.","I quite liked the geometric algebra introduction in this book. It was one of the simplest and clearest I've read. That is, until the paravector notation is introduced. I felt overwhelmed by the variety of conjugation operations suddenly tossed out (clifford conjugation, hermitian conjugation, grade automorphism).Having learned what I know of Geometric Algebra based E&M; with the STA formalism, this approach seems more difficult. The complexity (literally) of having to deal with conjugation and scalar and vector selection seems much less intuitive.Some of the tail end chapters almost seemed tossed in randomly. It was hard to see what value GA provided in the spherical harmonic treatment.I'd hoped that this text would provide an easy path to learn E&M; in a GA context despite a requirement for having to switch from STA notation to APS, but didn't feel the presentation provided a logical sequential flow of ideas that would facilitate this study."
1,No response from Owner,Wrote owner regarding damaged CD and have had no response as of today's date. Hopefully this can be resolved in a short period of time. Really was looking forward to listening to this compact disc.
2,This card's a slug,"It's a 9250 - it's better and faster than a 9200, right? Wrong. Thanks once again to the deceptive practices of video card chipmakers, (and nVidia is as guilty as ATI), you have a card that is only half as fast as a similarly equipped 9200.Without boring you with the technical details, the problems are twofold. First, the memory on this card is clocked slower than on 9200's. Second, and most importantly, manufacturers have a choice of using a 64-bit or 128-bit memory interface. Manufacturers using a 64-bit interface will effectively cut the performance of the card in half. Guess which one Visiontek uses?Visiontek's technical support staff are helpful, but their repair service could use some improvement. It's nice they offer a lifetime warranty, but it's not much help when repairs take a month or longer to complete.Skip this card (and 9200SE cards) and search for a 9200 model card with a 128-bit memory interface. It's about the same price, but you get much more bang for the buck."
4,Very nice watch . . .,"I now own 5 Invicta watches (all below the $50 barrier) and the pictures online do not do them justice. They are excellent looking watches, very substantial (yes they have weight but ""heavy"" is a relative term, depending on the individual), keep excellent time and come with a 10 year battery (if the battery lasts even 5 years, then 5 stars)."
4,Valuable reference,"Pretty decent book, good info. Even though the last edition was a while back, but life on Galapagos doesn't change fast, so it's still a valuable reference book for visiting the islands."
5,Great Guide,"Booked a trip to Galapagos Islands...this book has been a great source of information on what to bring, what to expect, how to photograph wildlife, etc. Although, we had already booked our trip when we received the book, the section on ""planning"" your trip or choosing the tour company seemed like a great resource for someone doing initial research."
5,best gift ever!,"My family loves this table. We use it in our kitchen for crafts and snacks/meals. When company comes over, it's the ""kiddie table"". It's sooo much better than having the kids destroy our wood table. If you have a smaller kitchen, like me, it's fabulous b/c you can fold it down and store it in your garage, or another room!THe middle cracks ARE annoying, but I just clean them out with a sponge. For me, the worst part is the hole. My kids put food down it, which falls on the floor. I WILL be taping that up soon!"
1,falls apart,This is by far the worst product I have ever owned from this company. It stays together for days and when my kids lean on it wrong it falls apart...and I mean all pieces a part. I would never suggest this table unless you really need to have one that folds up. Ours did not have the center hole so I guess ours was an older one. But buyer beware.
2,Great Book - Not Great Quality,"I ordered this book as a gift for a friend who is expecting a baby. My son loved the hungry hungry catepillar as a baby, so I was excited to get this box set for my friend. Unfortunately, the Lonely Firefly book (which lights up and runs on batteries) came with dead batteries that were also a little corroded. Because of time-constraints, I had my husband clean out the battery compartment and we had to run out and purchase new batteries ($12). So, great book, not great quality."
2,Wong & Whaley's Clinical Manual Pediatric Nursing + Pediatri,"Books by this author are long winded. You need to read page after page before they get to the point. Sorry, nursing students, this one is expensive mainly because they must get paid by the word:("
1,What a piece of junk!,We just can't put this flimsy piece of ---- together.PASS on it and save your money!!!!!!
2,I don't recommend it,"I love Cris Connor's voice and style, but in this CD these qualities just aren't there. She sounded old! I blame myself for not having listened to more of the samples, and reading carefully the ""liner notes."""
5,Almost One Of The Best Games,"This Game Is Off the Heshee fosheshee. The thing that is always tight about this game is that it has good graphic,kinda fast speed, and better than most games."
2,"""Ok but could be much,much better!""","This game is the worst DragonballZ game I've ever played! On the case, it says, Violence/Animated Blood. There's no blood and there's mild violence. I think it should be rated E, NOT T!Here's what I think of this game!Story Line- 2/5 stars, It doesn't stay on the story. For instance,Did Hercule kill Cell? No, Teen Gohan did.""STICK TO SUBJECT!""Violence- 3/5, Ok, but could be better, and could have more blood as well. ""IT'S TOO KIDDISH""Overall Graphics- 3/5, I love 3D vision, but the graphics could be better. ""MORE LIFE-LIKE!""Overall Gameplay- 2/5, ""STINKS HARDER THAN MY BROTHER'S GYM SOCKS!""This game ""STINKS ON ICE!""IT'S A WASTE. Get NBA STREET VOL.2 IT'S BETTER!"
3,this was a good game,This was a good game but i gotten board of it quickly but this was good. I don't care if the graphic was 3d it was still good.
3,It's okay.,"This is kinda cool,the cut sceens,the intro,the voices,awsome,but don't,repeat,don't ever,EVER,play tournament mode,it's awful,that's why this game get's three stars,sorry DBZ."
4,DBZ fanz all over the world,"Based on what I heard about this game it seems like a must buy game.I mean it is one of the first that can be seen in a telivision screen.Oh come on DBZ fanz of coarse ""Legacy of Goku"" was great and all but it's short and you can only see it through a small screen. You must try Budokai for the fun of it.I haven't tried it yet but it looks great.You don't even have to buy it but at least rent it."

4,This is so COOL,I Love this game and DragonBallZ. If they make a Budokai 2it might be The Majin Buu Saga to the Kid Buu Saga. DragonBallZis so cool that it is and looks better that DragonBallGT the nextseries.

1,Piece of junk,"Dont waste your money on this piece of junk, Different weights every time you step on the scale even if its moments after the previous weigh in.."
2,Good while it lasted,"We really loved this scale. But about a year or so after we bought it it kept eating up batteries in a couple of weeks, would stay on all the time, not going off, and had to quit using it as I can't afford the 2 large watch type batteries and the regular batteries every couple of weeks."
4,A really good CD,"This is really a nice cd. And this isn't even marketed as anything except just ""music"". I don't know what to call it, except music I like. This is some of the most creative music ever put down on compact disc. You can sit down and think while you have it on in the headphones or you could just let it play as mood music while you're doing work or what not. This album works because it takes a feeling and sustains it over the whole cd. Every track has a different mood, but it's the emotion that gets me - earnest, wistful, yearning emotions that are part of every track. I like the Jazzy sounds. You know, when it comes down to it, I don't like to think too much about music. In the end, what's important is how music makes you feel. Spicehouse makes me feel good and thats whats good for me. A really good CD"
3,SMALL,This was a cute toy for my son who loves rocket ships:) However the shipping charge is huge and the toy is smaller then my hand. I would not recommend this to anyone and I would not buy another one
1,Self-serving and stupid,"Stephen Powers wastes much of this book with inside jokes between himself and the taggers that he choses to write about. It is poorly written and fails to explain why the taggers do what they do. The pictures are impressive and he does add a touch of historical perspective to graffiti in the USA, but ultimately it is a self-serving and worthless book. Your money would be better spent buying a graffiti magazine."
3,the book has alot of oldschool not eneough new skool stuff,the book has the classic kings but they left out the kings of today such as the fx cru and the att crew from the midwest
4,OUTSTANDING,"WHAT A PLAYER! THIS GUY KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. OBVIOUSLY, COOK CAN SHRED, BUT HE IS SUBTLE ENOUGH THAT YOU AREN'T PUT OFF.THE COVER OF STING'S ""FRAGILE"" IS A BONUS-O-LATTA! IF YOU LIKE KENNY G, MAX COHEN (CAPE COD GUITARIST), OR LEO KOTTKE, YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS CD.GO ON NOW, DON'T BE SHY...PRESS THE 1-CLICK! THERE YA GO! NOW YOU'RE COOL. WOMEN WILL SWOON WHEN THEY HEAR THIS! TRUST DAYSOFGRAY! TRUST HIM NOW!"
2,It's OK BUT....................,"I have heard all of these new age, nouveau flamenco artists. Eg. Ottmar, Jesse, Strunz etc....... They don't come close to the original, interesting and excellent guitar sounds of Alex Fox. Alex Fox is the best of the best.... If you like these guys, you're going to LOVE ALEX FOX."
1,Another bad imitation unleashed,"It's very funny how this guy keeps on showing up on so called ""flamenco"" recordings. In my opinion he is only following a tired genre created by the likes of Ottmar Leibert, John Tesh, and Kenny G. All in search of a quick buck on the backs of a naive audience. Hopefully consumers will wise up and try to listen to something that has real emotions contained on it, and without frilly names like ""Breeze from Saintes Maries"". Poco ruido y poco duende!"
3,you have what you pay for,"The product is not bad, but has some problems:1) If you put the bottle in the horizontal it won't leak for a couple of hours, but it start leaking after that.2) Since the internal part is plastic, it is impossible to remove the smell of wine, even washing very well.For the price, it is a good product, but don't expect much of it."
2,Pretty but not for the regular wine drinker,"This piece of equipment is lovely on display. It has a modern, sleek look and appears both functional and attractive. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up to the test of time. I imagine that if you only drink wine now and again, it may serve for a couple of months or maybe even a year if you're lucky, but if you even semi-regularly go through wine (and I put this on my cooking wine, because I thought that it would be best for something I had to pour regularly) you'll find yourself disappointed. The mechanism in the pourer stiffens after only moderate use, and eventually becomes completely useless. I was very disappointed, my other OXO kitchen goods have served me very well and I was expecting this product to perform similarly."
1,"Good idea, poor execution","Generally speaking, I have found OXO products to be superb. This item does not achieve that standard. It is handsomely designed, but it doesn't hold up under even semi-regular use. The little ballbearing dealie inside quits rotating, the lever stiffens up, and the whole thing becomes only useful as a cork.I have had two, both have now been returned as defective, and my S.O. just got off the phone with OXO informing them that this object is unsatisfactory.I hope they will get it right with a redesign."
2,In search of perfection.,"Rather disappointing for an Oxo product. It is attractive, but as a pourer, it is slow and as a stopper, it does not seal well enough to lay the bottle down. I will keep looking for the ""Perfect"" stopper-pourer. This one isn't it!"
1,Failure,"After only 2-3 uses with hand washing, the valve on BOTH of the stoppers I purchased have failed. They will no longer close. This item is not worth any price."
3,predictable,"""Prime Suspect"", is, as a crime-drama program, an over-all good program. However it is just too status quo: PREDICTABLE. The best thing this show has going for it is its actors; especially Maria Bello."
2,difficult to use,"My wife, who refuses to learn to use a computer, finds this difficult. She has gone back to using our noisy and dirty IBM Selectric"
2,Did not work for me...,Did not work for me...Health Journeys: A Meditation to Help You with Weight Loss....I donated it to the public library maybe it will work for someone else!~
3,"Wow,Do my eyes hurt...FROM FLYING OBJECTS !","Starring: Michelle Penick ,Victoria De Mare,Elina Madison& Christine NguyenWritten & Directed by : Eric Forsberg[...]This film is a Mockbuster/or at least a riff on all those National Lampoon movies and generic teen comedies with Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.The dope,drugs and marijuana stuff is a amusing,If only as a DIY weekend project for misbegotten teens.Some of the situations arent that funny,Bro/Sis mistake and Strawberry's extra quality.Michelle was awesome female lead and has quite a future( See interview elsewhere).The others mentioned above stole their moments with great ease,Christine is a SOV legend and very funny and Victoria has a huge list of credits in all genres,Elina redefines MILF !Some things on road seem out of Scooby Doo mysteries in a SUV ."
3,dirty & corrupt,this book shows how the corruption in the law enforcement agency is really true those cops where some dirty s.o.b. and the were worst than the so called criminals !
3,good amateur effort,it's okay; the author relies a lot on exclamation marks to try to create a sense of excitement. Chris Cocks is still the one to read.
4,Burned,Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.Amazing. Amazing. Amazing amazing Amazing.Amazin. Amazing I love this book. It caused me an emotional rollercoaster
2,"Great read, but....","I listened to this book as an audiobook. I was excited to listen to it whenever I could. It flows great, and the author does a great job writing. I am kind of bummed that I spent all of that time reading this book for her just to end it as she did. I don't want to spoil the book. It is a good read, but I do wish it was ended different. The book is about her constantly battling what she believes, and so it seems that, in the end, she is punished by God because of her actions. Frankly, I think her parents, especially her dad, should have been punished. No child should be treated like that. Love your children unconditionally or stop having kids."
4,Burned,"I bought Burned and didn't expect much to come out of the book, man was i wrong!!! I got a few pages into the book and was hooked, i loved this book and finished it in 2 days. It's a wonderful book and i suggest that everyone read it."
5,Amazing,another great read from hopking... i have loved everything she has writen. stories that are good and could be real..very realistic hitting on real life issues
5,DreamCatcher games are Awsome!!!,"I personally love Dreamcatcher games! The graphics are breathtaking. I own and played two of the games in this pack, I wasn't in for the pony game, not my thing as a 40 yr. old man. Syberia I've played twice once for the game and the puzzles the second time was just to view the graphics. The other game was like all the other Dreamcatcher Games great puzzles and awsome graphics. If your looking for slash em up gun toting machinegun action these are not the games for you. The puzzles are thought out logical puzzles with a great story background. If this is your first introduction to this company be warned you will be hooked. I own all most the whole Dreamcatcher games. For young Girls, Grown ladies and even Men will enjoy the games. I can't speak for the horse game but I'm sure it's just as awsome based on my experience. Check out their Nancy Drew games too. Their great for girls as well! Im a Man and I enjoyed them. So give them a try."
3,"???????? ""you really like him?""....????????????","i always think i like Jackie more than i do. even went to see the bio-film. its a good album...but maybe hes not the best jazz singer in the world like so many people tout him to be. its hard to review a CD that even my wife says, ""you really like him?"".... i dont know...maybe 3 stars is too much."
1,A Terrible Kung Fu flic,Dont waste your time. This is a terrible movie. Frigging super bad dubbing makes it worse. A little kid is beating up big men and the custumes are cheesy.
5,authentic Dutch drop,"If you've ever been to Holland, you know the Dutch like their licorice (called drop). This is authentic Dutch drop, imported. the Cats are not too sweet and very chewy."
5,I've been won over,I have never been a fan of black licorice ---- until I tried these ! These are the perfect balance of licorice flavor and sweetness. I also like that they are very firm so I suck on them awhile before I chew them up. These little black cats are perrrrrrfect.
2,What size is it?,"This table looks great, but I can't consider buying it because I have no idea what size or how tall it is."
5,Brother Style H Correction Ribbon,This ribbons works perfectly in my Brother AX10 typewriter. I shop for the best price and the price for this item from Amazon is the best I have found. You will not be disappoiinted with this product.
1,Will never buy from this seller again!,"I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to do so this time. I purposely paid more by going with this seller because I wanted the version of this mixer that came with chrome beaters, wire beaters, and a whisk (not just the chrome beaters and whisk as sold in other versions). The description specifically states that the product contained all 5 attachments. However, when I got the shipment, I found that the seller had sent the version without the extra set of beaters. We sent a report (which the seller didn't dispute), but are only options were to send the product back for a refund (though we had to pay return shipping) or get 15% back--just $2. Even with the $2 off, I still ended up paying more for a mixer than I didn't want than if I had purchased it from a different seller to begin with. This seller is horrible--do not buy from them!"
1,The beaters can fly out,There is danger with this model and the danger is that the beaters will not go into the sockets not just a little hard but a whole lot hard and when you are mixing I feel the beaters moving from side to side in the sockerts and it makes me nerous while i am using it. Also this unit does not have a slow speed. The first level would be what I call medium and them medium would be fast. I cannot imagine anything needing fast with this speeed control that it has. I have had mixers all my life but i have not had me nervour to use when i am trying to make something for my family.
4,handy product,"I only use it to beat eggs and it works perfect. Except that the noise it makes is really loud. But this is my first mixer, so I do not know how loud the noise is comparing to other brand."
3,Decent Bag,"This was a decent bag, but not a real good reproduction of a real Bota Bag. Too much plastic and the screw top plastic filler top slightly leaks. It will hold liquid and is functional."
3,Bota Bag,"I generally like Botas. I grew up using them. The lining of this one leaves a bit of taste from the plastic, so a drop of lemon handles that. The flange around the cap is loose and should be anchored better. And finally the rope/string should be longer so we can throw it over the opposing shoulder. This one is too short for that."
2,Plastic Lining,"I ordered this item thinking it was plastic free, but this was not the case.I'd reather have an original with a pitch lining that costs 10x more.If you don't care about a plastic lining, then this will be fine for you."
3,Ok Item,"Well made. Item packaged securely. Shipment was timely. Wish the glasses were a tad bit larger. Then again, how much brandy is one going to have. In any case, these are very small."
3,"Okay, but only for parties.","This is not the kind of soundtrack one can listen to regularly and get familiar with. I'd say it's best to play at a party because it makes for perfect background music to chatting and drinking and it's neo-techno feel is suitably apt.Mars Colony also have a soundtrack CD available for Streets Of Rage 2, which is also more thematic. The music on this CD is rather good, with great beats and all but it just seems in between a soundtrack CD and a regular 'trance' CD. Some of the tracks are 'Tribal Dance' mixes and I can't imagine most of the music being out-of-place in a typical nightclub.So if you can find it, get a copy. It's also great for budding DJs to have fun with in mixing and editing."
3,"""Kings of the Ring"" a condensed boxing history.","""Kings of the ring"" is a 1995 condensed history of boxing. It would be difficult to include all of boxing history in one DVD but I feel that mentioning John L Sullivan to Jack Johnson wouldn't take but a few minutes if not to show footage of Jack Johnson and explain why there was a search for a ""Great White Hope"" especially if one begins with Jack Dempsey vs Jess Willard. The film does address the ""Long Count"" and how boxing rules have changed. For a boxing enthusiast the film is not as fulfilling as others I have seen, but for a novice the film is fine. I do not believe that this film will create a plethora of new boxing fans but it is still entertaining and historically accurate. . _Craig Barr"
1,"Inexpliciably, ear bleedingly BAD!!!","I have grown to expect very little from our music industry that celebrates mediocrity and promotes all that is un-excellent, however this, the Whiskey Rebels is a new level of bad. Never have I heard such lack of creativity, not to their mention musical ineptness. The one redeeming quality may be their sense of humor, shown in the addition of their obviously comical bass lines. I mean, I am assuming even they don't take these things seriously! This must only make them popular with 16 year old girls, which I would also assume makes up the bulk of their audience. ..."
3,Decent camera,"As much as intriging a hard disk may be, you should be awre that this are pretty much first generation cameras and thus they do have some problems. Should you overcome these, you should be happy with this camcorder.More specific:-if you are an exclusive mac user then you should not buy this as it is not really compatible with apple.-it is pc compatible but you may need specific software (or settings) in some instances-if you have a new sony pc life is easier for you-you do not have to deal with tapes anymore and thus downlowding is much much faster-easy to use and good lens.-small and handyAll in all a decent camera but I expected more from Sony as they have proven that they can do better."
2,Do not purchase if you are a Mac user,"I owned this Sony for a single day before I returned it to Amazon. First off, it records in MPEG2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer. It is also not natively supported on the Mac without a 20$ additional Quicktime MPEG2 plugin. Which has to be converted before editing. Which makes it a slow, tedious affair. Also, the included software is, surprise, PC only.Other problems, not computer related - the Chroma shift in ""night mode"" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly. I'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(Sony). The auto white balance could also use the same attention.Like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a PC. The LCD touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use. All in all, I would go for a Canon."
5,This is fantastic,"I have this in both dvd and video, in fact a bought another copy for my friend. I think Daniel O'Donnell out did himself with this video. I found his music outstanding, and it brought back memories. Even though I'm only 46, I still love the oldies. Keep up the good work Daniel. God bless you. Lauren."
2,You better know your facts,"A group of us tried to play this game. WOW! You better be up on your state facts! This was very hard and were all in our 30's, educated and regular game players."
2,Wasted potential,"There's a lot of potential in the storyline and the idea of satirising its own genre with a fictional Regency hero come to life. The Amazon review episode was a nice touch. Still, on the whole, the writing doesn't quite fulfil the potential. It doesn't sparkle, it's not quite witty enough, the characters are a tad too hysterical and Saint Just just feels out of place. Maggie is meant to be endearing but comes across as a scatterbrain. The only real solid character is the policeman and he's underdeveloped. The book becomes tedious after a while."
1,Not a good sample,"If you aren't familiar with Kathy Acker, I wouldn't recommend this as your introduction to her. If you enjoy Acker's fiction, I wouldn't recommend this book. Acker's fiction is irreverant, fun and thought provoking. This collection of her interviews and academic-style essays, however, just comes across as awkward. There's little to no connection between the essays collected here and Acker herself says in the introduction that she doesn't like this collection.There are a few essays in this collection that are interesting to look at, but they can be found online for free instead of dealing with everything else in this collection."
4,Loving It!,"I've had my Archos 605 80G for almost a month now and enjoying every bit of it. As many reviewers have indicated, the battery life needs improvement and there should be a wall charger included in the package. The product is also quite masculine - and lacks physical appeal. Apart from those three complaints, I am satisfied with the product and it's capabilities.Archos need to step up there advertising because I knew virtually nothing about this product until I was reading some reviews while deciding whether or not I should purchase the iPod Touch 16G. Alas! I was more convinced that the Archos better suited my needs (taping my tv shows and the video capabilities).Now I need to figure out how to keep my husband from using it more than I do ;)."
2,still not up to expectation,"I bought this archos after a friend of mine raved aboiut his. It was very difficult to use and tech support was not that helpful but once I got my friend over to help me use it I saw the benefit of this compared to other mp3/media players including ipod. The fact that I can record direct from tv is great. I watch my shows on my long coommute into work everyday. Ive been using it for the past year and I have to say it still has not met my expectation. Cons: difficult to use, sound quality is not great and its a bit big and bulky compared to others."
4,Archos 605,"I purchased the Archos 605 (80GB) as an xmas present for myself. I love the features, however, the user manual leaves a lot to be desired. Since I got the unit at such a great price, I didn't mind buying a couple of the plug ins. The unit is a little slow. As I figure out how to use more and more of the features the more excited I am about the unit. I'm enjoying it."
1,error 102,"Got it on 1/1/09 and i got error code 102 May 2. wont work and the worst part about it is I never use it do to it being so big, battery life being so short. Then you got the proprietary charger! Accessories are expensive. Just all around sucks. I wanted to like it but it was just a waste of money. Oh and customer service had me fill out a RMA but that was last I herd from them."
4,Amazing device,"I've had my Archos 605 for a couple of weeks now and I am completely addicted to it. The Video is amazing. Although I have ripped six dvd's to it, added around four gigs of MP3's and about two gigs of pictures, I haven't even put a dent in the eighty gig storage. The only complaints I have are the battery life...which doesn't come close to the 5.5 hours stated if you bounce between movies to pictures to mp3s back to movies, and the low volume which sometime picks up a scratching noise when accessing the hard drive. I believe a software update would probably cure the sound issues and complaining about the battery life is like complaining about gas milage of a Lamborghini. I would definately recommend the 605...I would definately buy it again."
1,Terrible features,"I was excited to receive my archos player but soon after opening it up I realized all the functionality is controlled by archos. What I am referring to is paying for virtually every function on the device (move software, etc.). After about 30 minutes I realized I would have to pay an additional 50-100 dollars in software that is compatible with the device. I decided to return the product as it does not do everything that its marketed to do ""out of the box"". Highly disappointed with archos - will not be purchasing anything form them again."
1,"Its great, if you dont plan on using it for more than a year.","Well, as many of the previous reviewers had said, its a decent product but has it quirks. That was the case with me. Until a week after the warranty expired. The hard drive is failing and none of the fixes work. The company wants 200 to fix it. 200 to replace a $40 hd? You cant replace the hard drive yourself because they locked the hard drive to the unit. You used to be able to change but they quickly fixed that loophole with a firmware upgrade. The customer service sucks. Avoid this product. Buy an ipod touch. You will be happier by far. Never again will I buy anything from Archos."
2,"Initially Happy, later dissapointed",After owning several other hard drive based mp3 players Ipurchased the Archos 605 30G model and was initially quite pleased with it.The screen had a nice display with good customization options and themp3 audio random play was well executed and functional.The problem came in however with the battery. In a relatively shortperiod the battery would no longer hold a charge. The battery is hard wiredin the unit and cannot be easily switched by the end user. Attempts touse the unit with the battery low eventually damaged the hard drive andnow it is another piece of electronic junk sitting on the shelf.I will never buy another such unit again where the battery cannoteasily be swapped and exchanged (similar to a digital camera).
4,Very Happy,"Was originally concerned by some reviews that mentioned the interface is sub par. To my pleasant surprise, I actually liked the interface. Drag and drop is a VERY nice feature to have. I use this mainly as just an mp3 player. Even tough it is bigger than an ipods, it is much better for a few reasons:1. touch screen with 160gb... ipods you could get touch screen and 16gb or no touch screen and 160gb2. true drag and drop (don't have to use itunes! YAY!) Can use windows media player if you want instead.3. wifi anyone? Just archos has this4. extremely competitive price for the feature set5. don't have to re-encode every movie to work on it.6. 800x480 resIt is bigger an an ipod, but as a female i can't fit an mp3 player in my pockets anyways. I am so much more happy with this device than any ipods, and I have owned 2 ipods."
2,great player but stupid power option,This is an amazing player..with the opera plugin you tube vids look amazing.. my only grip is the included accessories..there is only a usb cord to connect to the computer..and this takers HOURS.. to charge the battery! why a company would supply only this power source in the box is unbelievable to me..it makes the device virtually unusable without an accessory.. i can see charging exrea for plug ins but not basic power supply! i would give it 5 stars without the power issue
2,Don't drop it,"Yes, the 605wifi can connect to your network, but the plug-in needed for the web browser is another $30. Other plug-ins are even more expensive.UPDATE: dropped the 605 from less than a foot off the ground. The hard drive is shot. I really don't want to buy an ipod, but in terms of overall quality and reliability, I can't find anything that's equivalent. Certainly not Archos products."
2,Disappointed - my own fault,"Read the reviews and bought it anyway.OK, the good news is it does, for an extra [...] bucks, play videos. It doesn't remember where you stopped. But it does play themAs for the browser. Archos doesn't out right lie, ""with Flash support"". So while Flash 10+ is now out, I go to nbc.com to view videos and am told I need at least version 9. So whatever version that you can buy bundeled with the browser, for an extra [...] bucks, is less than 9.The browser is clunky, you can't scroll down w/o clicking some link. Zooming the browser works, for me, haphazardly at best.Bottom line, for [...] bucks, it plays videos w/o conversion. As for buying any other add on, give your money to a charity. You will get more for it.For surfing and every other thing else I do, I will have to stick with my iPhone."
2,"So Many Bugs and Glitches, Poor Tech Support","If the product worked correctly consistantly and if thier support line and email support were of any help at all, this would be a very impressive product, easily worthy of all 5 stars. But it doesnt, and they're not, so it's not. My unit randomly resets itself when i try to watch movies or play music. It often corrupts data or needs me to erase all user settings to respond to my commands. The help on the phone often sounds like they're too busy surfing to help me, other times they just are of no help. The email support ducks questions and when i began asking about exchanging my item for a new one that works (26 days after purchase) they stopped answering me. I would never suggest buying anything from archos in the future. poor."
2,No noise measurement!,Any power supply tester needs to see if the noise on the power meets specifications.Putting a static load on and testing is only a very crude test... you need a stepped load and an ocsiliscope to do this correctly.
4,Ryder Cup !,"I have watched this DVD, quality is above average and has comprehensive coverage of this historical event. This is one for the golf DVD Libary!!! Get it!"
5,hamilton beach electric knife,"I have only used this item once to carve a ham. It made perfect slices and the Amazon price was a bargaign. I would recomend this product to my freinds, it worked great! The fork that comes with it was also great."
1,electric knife,"Buy cheap get cheap.This product was terrible,needed two hands to operate.Would not recommend it to anyone ever!! Nothing more to say !"
2,Not what I expected.,"This is by far the worst electric knife I have ever owned. This is not what I expected from Hamilton Beach. The trigger is very difficult to hold in the on position, especially if a little grease gets on the knife body, and the handle shape tires your hand after a few minutes. The blade, while sharp, flexes way too much. I'm going back to a Black & Decker - lower price and better ergonomics."
3,Carving Knife For Crafting,"I wanted a craving knife for crafting - to cut different types of foam accurately and quickly. This knife is certainly adequate - however, the handle is just a little to large to hold comfortably in my hand for more than 15-20 minutes. It might be better suited to a man's hand instead. It works great, has been easy to maintain, and that is really my only gripe about it."
3,for a cheap electric knife it does ok,"Not a bad knife at the price... it cuts and does exactly what I needed- ie, it cuts brisket thinly... ;)"
1,electric knife,"I have used electric knives , cleaning salt water fish, all my life but this one is very hard to use. The trigger to turn it on will not just push in to turn on. You have to squeeze trigger but you must also use pressure toward the end of handle to get the knife to turn on. Carved a whole turkey and never got used to trigger. No eazy to operate!!"
2,I want my money back,"I was so dissappointed with this book. There is nothing new or remotely original. In fact, if your mother ever taught you the rules of basic etiquette then you have more useful knowlege than this book gives. Also, the book is now rather dated. The names she drops are either now out of favor or have been forgotten. If you are still curious go to the library and read it for free."
1,Not fit for purpose,"This product is completely underwhelming. After correct installation, and running for 5 hours on full capacity, this unit cooled a living room by 2 degrees, hardly better than a fan.At first we thought we must have installed incorrectly, but we hadn't.Then we thought it must be a broken unit, but we had two, and they were equally dismal.The water tray fills up very very quickly, and when it is full, the cooling switches off.The ONLY positive thing to say about this experience is that we purchased via Amazon, which is arranging complete pick-up and return of the units, as well as helping send out a service to help us repack the units. So, 1/5 for the unit, 5/5 for Amazon."
4,HOLY SHHHHHH!!,VERY IMPRESSIVE SWORDPLAY. GOOD ACTING AND GOOD DUBBING AND SOME FUNNY PARTS THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. I THOUGHT THE VIDEO QUALITY WAS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING ITS A OLD SCHOOL WUXIA FLICK. I MEAN ITS NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED OR ANYTHING. NOT ONLY IS IT WATCHABLE BUT ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY U SPEND ON IT IF YOUR ABLE TO GET A COPY...
1,Rate it 1 star for the seller,They sent this on time but my problem is they did not tell me that it was expired(thats why its cheap). I should have bought this from other seller that is more expensive. I'm about to return the product I cannot believe that they will sell expired stuff for kids. They sent the product with a letter saying that its still good after 2 yrs of expiration date. I tried to contact Mederma but they are not answering.
2,sloppy less choppy,This food processor says it's 'air tight' but in fact it is not. When i blend things with a high liquid consistency it has a tendency to spill all over the counter. it's difficult to clean and never processes things fully. i have chunks in whatever i process. it's good for maybe...salad dressing.
2,Dishwasher safe?,"This is my first food processor. I loved it (emphasis on the past tense). I could grate cheese like there was no tomorrow...but it is definitely NOT dishwasher safe. I put it on the top rack every time and it still melted. AND you can't buy replacement parts, or at least not anywhere that I've found. I'm going to try melting it back in to shape with a torch. If that doesn't work, I'm drilling holes in the bottom and turning it into a terrarium."
3,product is ok - but...,"The company had sent the wrong product. The one I ordered was supposed to have a lid in for the bowl and I received the 70550R that did not have it. I needed to use the product and could not sent it back.Currently, the company stated they would reimburse me a protion of the cost for their mistake, but as of yet, I still have not received it."
1,"Rigorous mathematically, but this is not always desirable.","I've studied finite elements in various formulations, and myopinion would be that this is not an appropriate text for someoneworking in the real world of civil engineering, say, or heatdistribution problems. I think it is too abstract for general readers. It reminds me of one of my profs who advised us to stay away from mathematicians because the mathematician will teach you rigor and rigor mortis. Still, it is a good book to have in your library just in case you need it, and it is available at a very reasonable price."
4,"Good, not great","I love TJ but found his latest collection of opinions to be a bit 'sameish' after a while. Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable read but much prefer his other book (a bit old) ATTACKS OF OPINION. His heart's in the right place here, and it's very funny, just not his best. MHO anyway."
5,Not Under Madonna's Shadow Anymore!!,"It amazes me that more talented artists dont have great success compared to artists that have even less talent.Niki Haris sang backup for Madonna for many years.I guess I know why Madonna's background hooks always sounded so good.This is an excellent ,mellow jazzy kinda cd.I was truly impressed by the relaxed feel and the great song selection.My favorites are:Here's to Life ,Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life , I Wish You Love ,Too Marvelous for Words"
2,So-So,"I'm a sucker for sequels and couldn't resist this one and on a rainy afternoon binged with this movie as well as the first, Underworld. Underworld Evolution picks up precisely where Underworld ended and all of the dangling ends finally twine together for an entertaining and dark action film. Action was pretty good (how can you go wrong with werewolves and vampires?) though the plot often seemed to be grasping for something more solid. This was definitely not as good as Underworld but still worth a watch but still mediocre compared to most films in the genre."
4,Pretty good movie!,"OK... I didn't see the previous ones. I was talked into seeing this one and I wasn't sorry.This movie delivers!Along the way, the characters do bring you up to speed as to the story line. So, I did understand what was happening after a while.What I liked most was that this movie moved! It gained speed and didn't stop until it came screeching in to the end. It is special effects laden, but this story could not have been told without all of the special effects.... and they are done well.It is comic book to be sure... so my expectations weren't too high. However, I was pleasantly suprised. They really did a good job with this movie.Not to be taken too seriously in regards to the folklore of vampires and werewolves, it is quite a romp through reaching for the heights.If you have some time to spend and want to be entertained and enjoy a thrill ride, I would definitely recommend this one. Worth every penny of rental. Take it for what it is meant to be and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Good sequel, not great-but good!","The opener for this film delves into the past and shows the relationship between marcus and victor, and marcus' brother. So there is that dynamic which adds a new senerio to the storyline. Besides that this sequel picks up right where the last one left off. There is more action in this film, more blood, a kate shows more skin, although I have a sneaking suspicion that a body double might have been in place for that scene. There are a couple of plot inconsistancies and action disappointments, but they are more of things I would have like to seen. Bottom line good sequel, nice addition to a video library."
3,More Vampires vs. Werewolves,More vampires vs. werewolves. Hard to go wrong with that formula. The action sequences were quite impressive and it's a movie where it's just nice to kick back and watch the undead blow stuff up.
1,Simply POOR,"I'm shocked at these reviews. Plot - hardly gone into. What was new from the first one? - thats where everything blew us away. This second is nothing but a vampire porno, little on plot development, nothing new. And this new vampire/werewolf - lost behind a female vampire who never needed him to begin with and, ""really"" - how many times did he get beat down. Looks like the vampire is still on tops and the hybrid fell to the wayside. Almost a side kick which the vampire should have been his mother and not a lover. Little on emotion, YES there is gore, and porn. The first film radiates brilliance and a nice breath of fresh air into the Vampire/Werewolf saga. This second film degrades the first. Nothing new in this film...its a sequel flop and will not sit beside the first Underworld film in my collection."
4,Mejor que la primera,"La realización de la pelicula es mejor que la primera de la saga. Mejores efectos especiales, mucha más acción. No es una pelicula para un Oscar pero es super entretenida."
3,it was okay but entartaining,I really liked the frst movie that came out a few years ago. I would still recommend it though.
3,Not As Good As Underworld,"The 1st Underworld was a brilliantly done film. It had a unique story and I loved how it ended leaving me wanting more. However, Underworld Evolution left much to be desired in the story department. Many horror fans claimed that the 1st Underworld didn't have enough action and had too much dialogue. Underworld Evolution didn't have much of a story and had far too much gore. It wasn't as good as the 1st film, still I think that Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and she makes the film watchable."
2,Not as good as the original,"This movie falls short of the original and is plainly a horrible sequel. Without the enigmatic Lucien, the charismatic Viktor, and the sinister Kraven, the plot falls short and is boring. When those characters died, the story died as did the incredible acting. Bill Nighy (Viktor) and Michael Sheen (Lucien) were what made the first movie and are both highly talented actors. Scott Speedman (Michael) is a boring character and a mediocre actor. I did not feel the chemistry between him and Selene in this movie just like I didn't see it in the first movie.There was nothing interesting going on with the raunchy sex scenes and the whole Corvinus family storyline with Marcus and William. BORING.I only give it 2 stars because of some scenes from the past featuring my favorite character Viktor in it. Other than that, it's a 1 star movie and not really worth seeing."
4,"Vampires, Werewolves, & Kate...What's Not to Love?","The first Underworld film was very enjoyable and had a plot that was easier to follow than Underworld Evolution, but this movie will please action fans even more. The special effects and acting have much improved (Kraven is given no dialogue!), but the story is a little hard to follow at times. I need to catch this one again just to get everything straight. If you liked the first film, I almost guarantee you will enjoy this one as well. Even if you don't enjoy anything about the movie, you can gawk at Kate Beckinsale for two hours. Yummy!"
3,Confusing mess,"So, these Lycans and werewolves, and their old dad, are immortal, except they can be killed by blowing them up? Or tearing their heads off? Makes no sense to me. Wouldn't they just regenerate? The first 30 mins of this silly dark and dreary mess are a complete muddle for non-experts. Having not seen any of this series before, I was lost. Not good. If you are making these, anyone should be able to drop in and make sense of it from the start. This needed better editing and/or a better script. But in the makers' zeal to make everything here move incredibly fast, they lost track of storyline. To be fair, the plot and the characters manage to sort of come together after awhile. The color of this is almost all blue and black and white. Very dark. I also don't get why something called UV bullets can slow down these immortals. Aren't they supposedly indestructible? Haven't they been around for centuries? Yet, here they can suddenly be destroyed. HHmmmm....."
4,Underworld Evolution Blu Ray,AN EXCITING SECQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL FILM. GREAT STORY TELL AND FAST PACED ACTION. GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SEXY KATE BECKINSALE TOO.
2,"Comparing to Blue Ray,,,,","I saw the blue Ray disc movie and bought the Dvd,It's not fun anymore. The sharpness and sound are all gone.It was just another stupid vampire movie....I felt the magic of Blue ray disc again."
4,George Washington's Moral Evolution,"However, lionized Washington was as a military leader, he was far more wishy-washy where slavery was concerned. His path to enlightenment regarding race was something other than a hero's journey. This book measures the slow growth of Washington's willingness to change. But about the bigger picture, this much is clear - Washington did change. And the force of his moral and intellectual progress can now be understood more deeply than before."
5,RENEWAL THE ANTIAGING REVOLUTION,"TO WHOM CONCERNHiI am very concern, because here say my stuff was shipped, and I DON{T HAVE IT YET.i DONT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, i WILL APRECIATE IF YOU KNOW WHERE IS MY STUFF. BECAUSE MY CREDIT CARD HAS A PAYMENT FOR SOMETHING I DONT HAVE IT.THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAD PURCHASED A BOOK FROM AMAZON AND ALWAYS I HAVE RECIVED MY STUFF ON TIME.THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP"
2,Not a gerontologist,"His specialty is Obstetrics & Gynecology. I felt it is a ""me too"" book on the topic. LEF.org has much more information and is more authoritive than Dr. Smith in my opinion and LEF is free.I would think any serious book on rejuvenation would mention phosphatidylcholine which is in all cells. Rats suplemented with it lived 35% longer than the control group and it wasn't administered until the rats were in such serious decline that they could no longer reproduce. After phosphatidylcholine they had full size litters. The only phospholipid I saw referenced in his book was phosphatidylserine.Borrow it from the library before you decide to buy it. I'm glad I did."
1,Literature through obscurity.,A summary of the Cory Doctorow school of literature.1. People think James Joyce is a genius.2. Joyce' books are difficult to read and understand.3. I want people to think I'm a genius.4. I will write incomprehensible nonsense.5. Profit!
5,Silvercrush vs Pearl Jam..?,"I chose this cd because of the lead singer Steele Croswhite. He is my favorite Christian Rock Artist. I could not resist buying his pre-Christian debut album. Especially when I saw the description of it being grunge-like rock. Pearl Jam is one of my most favorite of all bands, ESP grunge/alternative rock! Silvercrush, however, would have surpassed my love of PJ had they continued to make music. I love Steele's voice, his lyrics, his heart which I hear in his lyrics!If you enjoy bands like Pearl Jam, Candlebox, Counting Crows, Nickelback, etc., etc., you will love Stand!Silverceush crushed it with this CD!!Check out other titles by Steele Croswhite right here at Amazon.com"
1,not worth it,"This book costs around $50 and the ""chapters"" are only one page long! This book looks like a rough draft to a book that should have never been published. There are very few problems and solutions. If you like to blow your hard earned money, this book is for you."
2,Not the right end connectors.,"I would have expected this to come with the ball joints required to properly install this. It didn't, and I really gave up without looking much further into it. Vise grips on the old lifts hold the hood up just fine."
1,Don't buy this,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is a disgrace to literature. People don't care about Courtenay Love. Sorry, Courtney, but no. Nice try."
1,BORING BORING BORING,"This book really glosses over anything and everything interesting that has been written about Ms. Love. There is no description as to Ms. Love's struggles, her own creative process. How did she learn to play guitar? It's never mentioned. Things like her stripping are only glossed over, there is no details around the grittiness and heartbreak that accompanies the abuse bestowed upon women in these profession. Her relationship with Kurt is refered to in only the most general of terms. The writing is dull and the overall tone is saccharine, as if aimed at naive 12-14 year olds, who would be hard-pressed to like such a book. If you read it, you'll finish it in less than two-three hours. Stick to fiction, Poppy, there at least, you're doing something a little more interesting. As for Ms. Love, in this book, she is neither someone to be idolized or put down. The countroversy is gone. Just another boring media commodity."
1,Doesn't even get Courtney's real name correct,"Poppy Z. Brite asserts that Courtney was born Love Michelle Harrison. However, if you read another book, Her Mother's Daughter, written by Courtney's mother Linda Carroll, you see that Courtney's birth name was Courtney Michelle Harrison. If Poppy Z. Brite can't even get the name of her subject correct, I question the overall accuracy of other facts in this book."
3,Living Through It,"This book was a bit of a disapointment. Brite seems to be more content to write something that is more like an extended People Magazine story than a really good bio.This book seems like a retread of what we already knew about CL. There was nothing really new nor any real meaningful insight on the subject.Courtney is one of the most complex, fascinating musicians of our time. She deserves a more in-depth treatment than a quikie fan bio."
1,I have to give it to her..,"Courtney is a good actress. She has my favorite author fooled. As biased as I may sound, this book was a horrible portrayal of Courtney. Most people who didn't know anything about this woman would actually feel pity for her. If one actually has even the slightest hint of an idea about what Courtney is really like, they'll realize this book is overflowing with bs. Poppy Z. Brite is an ingenious writer, but I despise this book."
1,annoying,Jazz musicians should have more respect for their audience(They say that the average-turned-genius Miles Davis even performed once with his back towards the audience). If they don't have enough material to cut a record they should wait until they get it and NOT flood us with alternate takes (some records even have false starts as an independentgroove!). Such is the case here. It's a boring CD with a lot of repetition. It's not enough that we have to put up with a tenor that doesn't sound like a tenor; we must suffer through these nauseating alternate takes.
5,Saved My Relationship,"I am a man, and I just never thought I could save a relationship once the honeymoon was over. I didnt know you could get it back, and continue to have passion the rest of your life ! This book has made all of the difference."
4,Very Fine piece on the (then) 96 year history of both the CFL and the Toronto Argonauts,"Stars such as Mike 'Pinball'Clemens (now the Coach), DougFlutie, who won them two GreyCups at QB in 1996-97 and othersare featured in these fine setof nine VHS or DVDs that werefinally released about the CFL,the world's oldest ProfessionalFootball League, eh? Good showing!"
1,to firm to be tasty,"i LOVE licorice, but i have found that i should stick with jelly beans and twizzlers. These were just too hard!"
2,too crispy,"I don't know if I got a bad or old batch, but these things were so hard that you can actually hear a crunch sound as you bite into them. That's not my ideal candy style."
2,Over-priced and under-developed.,"As a history of an evolving commercial web site (HotWired) trying to discover itself, this short book is interesting. As a how-to book, it is disappointing. The book does have some valuable analysis of ""web strategy"", but you can easily absorb this information while flipping through the book in a book store."
4,Engaging story of small town intrigue,"Fictitious English hamlet is home to a little-appreciated church with some fine Gothic details. When a newcomer, deemed a little too flamboyant for some, arrives and tries to give the church a boost with a little show biz, unsettling events unfold.It's a delightfully descriptive, fast-paced story filled with nicely conceived characters. This is really a low-key mystery novel, but there's more to it than a whodunnit. In my opinion it remains one of her better works; shame it's not in print.Great fun if you want to get a taste of English country sensibilities."
4,Another aspect of Penelope Lively,"Penelope Lively is one of Britain's most versatile writers. And for this reader, she almost never fails to please. Lively as a wonderful sense of place. From Egypt to the far London suburbs, the setting is always a significant part of her fiction. This book will particularly appeal to Anglophiles but will also be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good read."
2,Not so good,I thought this would be a good but the flavor just was not good at all. I used part of one packet and don't expect that I'll be using the rest. Good concept but there's a lot of room for improvement in the taste.
1,What a crock of crap,"this seller is getting this hose bulk and selling it in a zip lock baggy, you supposed to put other stuff in a baggy, not a 2.00 hose, the end doesn't fit the hose right anyway unless you cut and manipulate it too fit, save the 30 bones for 172"" not a measly 86"" Shame on the seller......"
5,It swings,"Ronny Whyte has done it again! He is one of the great secrets of the New York jazz/cabaret scene. Mr. Weill's songs never sounded more American than they do on this album. Whyte's choice of substitute chords and alternative tempos enhance the original music, which is nearly perfect to begin with. Whyte's singing is always in-tune and tasty."
5,Finally - Christ is back in Christmas,"I happened to be out shopping when I heard one of the songs on this CD being played over the speakers, and was blown away by Dan Fogelburg singing a Christmas tune. I grabbed the nearest clerk and had them lead me to it. It has been my favorite Christmas CD ever since. It has a beautiful Renaissance feel to it, that just makes you want to dress up in period clothing and and go dancing in a castle. What is best about this CD though, is its true spirit of Christmas. He actually says that the Lord has given us a Redeemer to save us from sin. Way to go Dan! If you truly want to find the spirit of Christmas, to celebrate the birth of Christ, this is the CD for you."
5,Perfect...Because it is what it is.,"Sturdy, doesn't allow flexion of the pole w/the base. Can screw it on as tight as you can w/o stripping it. Is as good as you could dream it to be. That is if you were to dream about it."
5,These things are bright and well made!,"I've only had mine installed since July (It's now mid-November), but they're quite bright and throw a wide beam. Unlike motion-activated lights, and unlike CFL's, they work fine with Z-wave switches.Recommended."
2,Overated production,"The Royal Ballet has its share of faithfull followers, all over the world, and they usually applaud whatever comes from Convent Garden. I bought this video primarily because of Irek Mukhamedov - here a pale shade of the Bolshoi's ""Spartacus"" video or live performances in the ""Don Quixote"" pas-de-deux that left me breathless fifteen years ago. The corps de ballet delivers the worst ever performance, with a sleepish ""Kingdom of Shades"". I'm a Darcey Bussel dedicated fan, however I'd rather have her doing solos or contemporary work. In a romantic pas-de-deux it's kind of weird such a tall girl being lifted. If your really want great dancing check the Kirov version."
2,"not horrible, but going back","This phone has a much better range than my crappy old 900MHz phone, and I can walk all through the house, and around it and still get good reception.However, the sound quality is poor, with lots of quiet but disturbing background static. I have also experienced this in the only other ""digital"" phone I've owned, so I suspect a problem in the conversion from analog to digital and back.I also noticed some of the fade-in/fade-out effect while listening to some nice hold music, and some pops and clicks.The phone has a headset jack, but my standard 2.5mm headset doesn't work with it. My headset works with my two other cordless phones, so either there's a problem with this particular phone, or it takes a special proprietary plug."
5,Great product,"This box is amazing for the price. Although I ended up only using it for a week since I decided to go with a smaller subwoofer, my sub sounded great. The materials it is made out of are way better than what I expected for the price I paid. If you really want that extra sound for your car, and are on a budget, get this box so you can have more money for a better amp/sub. This box will do everything you want it to do."
3,Good Box,I don't think this box is anything special but it was a good value and it has worked out very well for me. I'm still glad I bought it. I haven't seen anything else I think I would have liked more - that happens with a lot of things that I buy (I wish I woulda...) but not this box.
5,waffle maker,"I love this! The ""flip"" action could be tricky if you don't have the wrist movement down pact but it really does make a difference in the size of the waffles that comes out. The size of the waffles is good too...haven't been able to eat more than one at a time"
4,Easy to use and quick,This is a good easy appliance to use. 3 minutes and they are done. Buying another for a Christmas gift.
3,makes tasty waffles,"This product cooks waffles in less than the 5 minutes it says it will take so it was fast enough to keep up with a hungry family of four. It produces thick fluffy waffles. The indicator lights stopped working, though, within about 2 months of use. The hinge also seems loose so i'm not sure how much longer it will hold together. It stands on its end when folded so doesn't take up much space in the cabinet."
4,"Good, Well-Priced Purchase","We did have some problems with the waffle batter sticking--even though we followed the recipes in the provided recipe book--but solved them all by using a bit of Pam between batches. Once we had that figured out, the waffle maker worked like a charm! Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. I recommend!"
2,Not as advertised.,"I ordered this to replace another 87 inch V-Belt that had broken on me. I received the item number described but it was only 82 inches long. Since it was 5 bucks, not worth sending back. Just be warned that what they say and what you get is different. On a plus side for them, for 5 bucks it is a really well built V-belt. They just need to get their measurements correct."
3,"Guide, but not an *Investors* guide","I picked up this book with two kinds of expectations. One that McCamant would give me the ""lay of the land"" of the Biotech space, the competing markets and the key companies. The other, that he would provide deep insight (a la Peter Lynch) on an investment method. On the first count, the book does a reasonable job. On the second count, it is very disappointing. Most of the investment rules are obvious and generic. The investment web links are outdated."
2,Not the best introduction to Dickens for kids,I was hoping that this series would be a good introduction to Dickens for younger children but I was rather disappointed. It zips through so many characters that it somewhat confusing and it failed to attract much attention from younger kids viewing it.
3,Cooks Nicely -- Lid Is Cheap,I love this slow cooker except for one problem: I had the cooker for only a month when the handle on the glass lid broke off.
4,A Great Read,"Great story. Great characters. The author says it's a collision of Heinlein and Clancy.....he's right, it is."
5,Quackwatch is no reference at all,"I've took a look at the site 'Quackwatch', because of David McCune's review 'The View of a Medical Oncologist'. What a joke!Here are some titles of articles on that site:'Homeopathy: The Ultimate Fake', 'Be Wary of Acupuncture, Qigong,and ""Chinese Medicine""', 'Be Wary of ""Alternative"" Health Methods', 'Don't Let Chiropractors Fool You', and so on...Looks like only the 'cut/poison/burn' method for cancer has this guy's approval.Wish all you people over here the best!"
4,The Cure for All Cancers,"I purchase this book for my brother when he found he had a cancer in form of lump on side of face (it was size of a tennis ball). It has been over a year, the lump is gone and the doctors cant believe he has no sign of the cancer. He changed his diet and used supplements also."
3,More about religion than romance,"I read about this movie and then it aired on television recently, the first week of September 2012, and I watched it. I don't want to criticize the actors, but the costumes were amazing. The subject matter, criminalizing interracial relationships was difficult to see on film, but all too true a piece of American history. Still, I was more intrigued by Henriette's allegiance to God and the French doctor's challenge of grappling with the concept of God when he was more invested in science. Being an interracial couple is one thing, but being unequally yoked is another. According to Scripture their union would not be proper because of Henriette's faith and the doctor's seemingly disbelief in God, as nice as he was. Had they both been the same religion they would be ""one in the Spirit"" and that unity could help them overcome prejudices through prayer as opposed to relying strictly on the law to save them. Just a thought."
1,Classroom textbook,"As the heading goes, I had to buy this for my class for school. If you are a professor and considering ordering this for your class, please don't! There is nothing in this book that a professor cannot teach his/her class on their own. The book is boring and doesn't offer any tips that most teachers don't already know."
2,not good enough,"I would have preferred a waffle/toaster that could also grill meat. It takes too long to heat up and cool down to facilitate cleaning.The cost is a little high for what you get and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I recall having a toaster similar to that in my youth and it recieved a lot of use, this item won't."
4,So it goes on...,"Well, I was not expecting this to be a trilogy. To say the least I was a little disapionted. I loved Song of the Silence so I was thrilled to get the next book. Lesser Kindred started slow but got more interesting and more emotional than the first but it dragged on a bit and I found myself skipping through a few pages to get to the more 'interesting' parts. The end for me was a big dissapiontment becuase I thought it would end there but no, it went on and I was left in shock until I realized I would have to wait and then get the third book which left me a bit peeved. You get so wrapped up in a book like this you can't quit grasp that there isn't anymore when it ends so ubrutly. All in all it was a good book but I can't help but feel it stepped down a knotch from the first. Hopefully the third book will blow our minds and make the whole trilogy fantastic. I still do recommend this book to anyone who likes dragons and fantasy."
3,No idea this was a kid's chair!,"It's a great chair for a 10-14 year old, but I had no idea it was for children. It should say it is for children in the name of the chair.very easy to assemble and I highly recommend it for children, NOT ADULTS."
2,Dont give in to the Hype.,State of Bengal by himself is a fantastic DJ and a masterful producer with immense talent. Anand Shankar is a legend and a true master. Here is the only explaination i can offer to explain the terrible mishap of a album...the stars must not have alligned themselves properly thereby bringing bad luck upon both of them. First of all there seems to be no production value what so ever and all songs seem to go completely haywire. The rythems a totally predictable and sometimes annoying. If your having a big party and you need some baground noise which sounds cool yet does not intrude in the coversation the get this CD but otheriwse.....i am sorry.
5,A must read for any budo student,"The title says it all. The most important part of this book is the beginning 2/3rds which speak about the mental, philosophical and spiritual disciplines of martial art. Even if you do not practice martial arts, those chapters will help you in your life. I've read it probably 5 times now.I must admit that I am a student of one of Shimabukuro Hanshi's students, so I am far from unbiased."
5,Powerful Music,"Steve Murray's books and DVD's on Reiki are the best in the market. I can give Reiki Attunements to myself and others. I can Beam and Scan, and can protect myself from Psychic Debris, this was the hardest for me to achieve. I have used Reiki on myself, many of my friend, several who are Reiki Healers. My sister who is a Reiki Healer, My husband, who was sceptic, has also recieved and been helped by me with Reiki. I am a Registered Nurse, and work in a Post Anesthetic Care Unit. I have helped many, many of my patients (with their permission). I have been practicing Reiki for many years, without formal education. I have read several other books on Reiki in the past, but it was not until after I received the Attunements with Steve's DVD's, and read Steve's books that I noticed a huge improvement in my skill, and I truly felt complete. The music CD, is a must have."
4,"Very cool, more traditional fun sound. Worth it!","These guys are great. Not like most of the stompin', huge sound of the new stuff (BBVD, CPD, etc) but still an awesome swing sound. Super version of 'It don't mean a thing'."
1,"Great concept, poor delivery","I've used countless type pans over the years and had to replace one that finally gave out. I decided to try this one by Rhino because it was enough to cover two oil changes for my vehicles and could be closed up. Well it has fit in two oil changes, however, the closing up is a different story. My main complaint has been with the train spout: It LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE! I changed the oil in one truck, put the pan in the back of my other truck overnight and came out to a good half quart leaked out. I thought maybe I didn't tighten the cap down enough so I gave it another quarter turn and the next day was more of the same. As much as I liked the concept, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
1,ran it over,As stated above this thing is a piece of crap. I took a lid off a windshield washer bottle to replace the small cap and it worked better to make it seal. I changed my oil the other day moved the vehicle and pulled my other vehicle out of the garage and accidenty ran it over when almost full. It actually left almost the same sized spot in the driveway as usual. Glad it's dead.
1,Ecological disaster waiting to happen.,"I went to several local auto parts stores looking for a good oil catch container when outfitting my new garage. All three of the different chains only carried this model catch pan and no others. I figured if it was all every store sold that it must at least be decent. I was wrong. It leaks all over the place no matter what you do and the cap for the large orifice does not seal at all, creating a large oil spill in your new garage and ruining your clothes. This is the absolute worst $10 I have ever spent."
1,This is worth zero stars but the least I could rate was one,"What an absolute piece of garbage. You won't be thinking about the money you wasted on this thing as hot oil comes splashing over the ""chicken wire"" mesh that sits under the large cover. Yes, the ""chicken wire"" can be removed, perhaps by just touching it and then the whole thing falls into the hot oil, but then you have a large area to drop the drain plug into, The side spout leaks and if you try to tighten it too much, it will pop back out, ditto for the top lid. Oh, by the way the top lid leaks a little bit, too, but if you're taking this thing full of oil somewhere, you better put it into a leakproof container....inside of another leakproof container - and maybe the place will throw the whole piece of junk out for you.I made a total mess the first time I used this, will get the oil drained and then the whole thing's going into the garbage and I'll look for a better design."
1,Leaky,"When I first bought this oil pan/container, I thought it was pretty neat, because it has a screen and a large twist cap that allows the container to be stood up after changing the oil. Well, after three oil changes, I have thrown it out. The small twist-off cap cracked and broke, and the large twist-off cap leaks when stood up. If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport. I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small. I made a mess when I used it, as the position needed to be adjusted - and forget about trying to line up this pan with the oil filter."
1,Does Not Stay Upright!,"This tent is very cute, and both my girls loved it for about ten minutes. The problem with it is that it does not stay in the upright position. It leans, and it just won't stay standing up. If there was a central support rod included, it might stand up. I will definitely stay away from pop-up style play huts and tents after purchasing this style."
5,Churches that Heal,"I recommend this book because it is Biblical in content, Basic in communication, and Believable in character restoration and reconcilation. Pastors, Denominational leaders, and Christian Education workers alike, can benefit from the inspired guidelines the author gives, along with his own victory over personal ""giants"" that he himself overcame; giving him the experience to write about this all important subject matter."
5,Excellent show,"I absolutely love this show. I've seen every single episode from this season through to the fourth season. It's so funny. I guess that word is overused but it truely is funny. I guess there are sometimes this is a little frustrating in the respect that he gets into some ludicrous situations, but overall, it's equal to Seinfeld."
1,Dull,An incredibly dull man does dull things for what seems like most of your life. Makes you understand how Bin Laden recruits
1,It's Terrible,"Curb Your Enthusiasm is vastly overrated. It's filled with uninteresting characters and unending stretches of absolute boredom punctuated by a few giggles.NOTE: I just said ""giggles,"" and not ""laughs.""I am fortunate that I got the DVD at my library and that only my real estate taxes paid for this awful, awful show."
3,Pretty Funny Show But...,"Larry David is obviously the template for George Costanza from the &amp;quot;Seinfeld&amp;quot; series and he carries that kind of 'anti-hero' over to &amp;quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&amp;quot;. Supposed to be about David's daily life, Larry finds himself in many Constanza-Quandries(like buying a pair of pants and finding they bunch up into a conspicuous lump in his groin area when he sits down).The situations are hilarious and you get to feel bad for poor Larry.The only problem I really have with the series is the use of language. I mean I may sound prudish and conservative, but does the constant use of the F-word really add spice to the dialogue? Sometimes I think that Larry peppers his scripts with profanities because it's HBO and he couldn't with the &amp;quot;Seinfeld&amp;quot; series.Great series, recommended for adult viewing only I'm afraid..."
3,"Sort of funny, but also irritating","I was a fan of Seinfeld so I thought I would like Curb more than I did. There were some funny moments and lines, but I never once laughed out loud. Frankly every show was sort of the same thing. Larry insults someone, either by accident or intentionally, then spends the rest of the episode trying to weasel himself out of trouble. This setup got old after a few shows and I kept watching waiting for them to do something different.As I understand it, Larry David was the model for George in Seinfeld. Watching Curb is watching only George for a half an hour. I found out that that irritates me more than making me laugh. Larry David is very good at his style of humor, but a whole show focusing on him wasn't as funny to me as it sounded."
4,A very funny take on life in LA,"If you ever lived in LA, or if you're planning to move there, this show is a must see. The show hits the nail on the head, poking fun at the absurdity of daily life in LA and how people there act. All the characters on the show are angry, unreasonable and live completely in their own head. Each episode perfectly builds up to some absurd ending where misunderstandings and anger get the better of everyone - but ultimately nothing is accomplished. Not unlike ""Frazier"" in that respect, but the humour is closer to that of Seinfeld. Funnier than both of these shows, this is a true winner."
2,Far away from Seinfeld,"Seinfeld made me laugh all the time. This one makes me smile from time to time. The way it is recorded (moving camera) makes it tiring. I did not enjoy watching the first episode, I forced myself to watch the 2nd, and then I gave up."
5,Too good to stop watching.,I like Seinfeld a lot. I was recommended this show by some one who said that it isn't as good as Seinfeld but it's the same type of show. I watched an episode and didn't think much of it. But after a few more I didn't think I liked the show but I found myself watching it. I only laughed out loud once or twice but it's one of those shows that are funny when you talk about it later with someone who also watches the show often. It gets 5 stars because it gives me something to do and someone to feel bad for (not to mention how addicting it is).
5,Pretty .. pretty ... pretty .... pretty good,"Last night me and my bud watched Larry for hours, I can never get enough of this American Jewel.The recent episode SURVIVOR made me roll on the floor and it was so funny it hurt my stomach.I haven't seen a show this good for a long time.Sometimes I get queer eyes from fellow workers because I can't help myself to laugh whenever Curb comes on my mind."
5,love it!,"larry david is hilarous, he has very unique and funny views on life. i like that the actors are playing themselves, and it is very realistic. definetly a new take on the classic comedy, i cant wait for the new season"
1,Worst Ever Show - I thought it would never end. Boring.,"Since I paid for the entire series, I forced myself to watch it to the end only to find there was no ending. It is supposedly mildly amusing, but mostly boring and stretched out and ridiculous. I think it was written by some elementary students. I only bought it because of so many good reviews. I guess I just don't get it."
1,Totally unfunny,"After reading the reviews I decided to invest in the first season of CYE. Can I say I was extremely disappointed, I know this show is mainly improvised with a loose script, but I would expect some funny moments at least. I pushed myself through the DVD set and there were no high points at all. A lot of reviews constantly say this is the ""new seinfeld"" or ""seinfeld's successor""......sorry but seinfeld was by far the better show compared to this effort. Sadly the only highlight for me was Cheryl Hines.....but even her beauty would not save this show."
5,Season 2!!!!!!!,"Season one was classic, but now I can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or season 3 for that matter, or even for what I've seen of season 4!!! Please Larry, I know it has been less than a month, but don't be like some of these shows are release a season every 18 months, we can't wait that long!"
1,No,"This was a GIANT mistake for this band.This is nothing more than Heart Of Chicago Vol. III ""LIVE"" complete with 2 new songs. The 3rd ""new"" is a Michael McDonald sung remake of ""Higher and Higher"" which does nothing but infuriate me. The Christmas album was absolutely wonderful and I had hoped they would just carry on into a new studio album.The live tracks here just do nothing for me. I made a audio cassette recording of the video ""Live at the Greek"" which I still listen to regularly and it's just so much better than what I find here. ""Back To You"" is horrific and the worst of the ""new"" batch of songs from the past few years. ""If I Should Lose You"" or ""..Ever Lose You"" (depending on where it's listed in the liner notes) has a spark but is surrounded by staleness.I guess I just expected more."
2,More of the same......,"This is band that owns its own record company, so it is beholden to no one. What was the point of this album? There is very little Bill Champlin or Robert Lamm on the live portion of this record, and there is far too much of Jason Scheff singing the Cetera signature songs. As the band has done with all of the compilations it has released since owning the label, new songs are added to the recycled material. In this case, two new power ballads along with a Michael McDonald fronted remake of Rita Coolidge's ""Higher and Higher"". No band performs power ballads better than Chicago, but wasn't the point of forming the record company to get away from the ballads and perform material with more of an edge? It would appear that Chicago is fearful of releasing an album of all new songs written by the band members. The two ""Heart of Chicago"" releases and this album show that the formula is to repackage the hits and add two or three new songs aimed at the Adult Contemporary market."
5,A wonderful love story!!,I read this book about a month ago and loved it. This book is perfect for someone in need of a good cry. I feel as though I knew Bree. I'm glad someone finally wrote a book that didn't end like a fairy tale but like real life. Great book!!
5,awesome book will want to read over again,This book was awesome I read good books all the time.This is the best book I have read for awhile. It was a wonderful love story that brought tears to me at the end.
3,Unnecessary Element,"Wonderful story of yearnings fulfilled; I really enjoyed the flavor and tone of a small New England town. But I felt the story was marred by the unnecessary addition of this ""benevolent"" voice offering three wishes. It was more like a malicious intelligence masquerading as benevolent, attacking someone at a vulnerable moment then manipulating things that would've happened anyways. Makes me angry how often we're expected to believe pain and suffering are norms, the only way we learn and grow. Could almost hear Rod Sterling at the end, something about redemption as found in the Twilight Zone."
2,Wishing for a different plot,"The title and the town intreagued me, but the storyline was poor and way too much misery for an escapism novel. Think Nicholas Sparks, then take away his straight forward manner and add some purple prose and you have Three Wishes."
2,book ended on a depressing note,"Although most of this book was pretty good, by the end I was in tears. I felt that there were several different options the author could have pursued rather that the one that she did (for the ending). It has been 3 days since I finished it, and I am still bothered by the climax of the book. Perhaps I shouldn't have had the wine with the book..."
2,"Lee Has Written Many Better Books,Don't Bother With This One","Of this 450pg book only the first and last 50 pages were captivating. This was one of the first of the 25 books I've read by her & also one of the worst. The vague international intrigue was more tediously portrayed than riveting. Choose a different book by Lee, for she's so prolific that you needn't read a bad novel just to experience her sumptuous prose."
2,Snorefest,"The best way to describe this book is as follows: Its written by a highly intelligent person with a PHD and they aren't afraid to flaunt it.I seriously felt like I was being talked down during the whole time I was reading this book- and I read it from cover to cover! Although it does contain a lot of helpful information, it was presented in a very ""college Biology textbook"" kind of format. Not really my style. Very technical, and very dry.More recommended for more advanced marine aquariusts and marine biology students."
3,VERY Lemon,"A very natural, crisp drink, but it is LEMONY like I've never tasted before. Gave me some wicked heartburn, but then again, that's just the way I reacted to it. If you're into a lightly carbonated Lemon drink made with the well known and trusted San P. water, this stuff is for you. If you tend to get heartburn/reflux, I'd advise you to steer clear."
3,AC adapter did not work,"The enclosed instructions say you can use a 9 volt 500 ma power supply instead of 4 1.5 volt batteries. I bought a universal power supply at Wal-Mart, set it to 9 volts, ensured the correct polarity, and turned on the LiteWire. The wire did not illuminate, and after about 30 seconds the control box started to overheat and smoke. In spite of the near-fire, the thing still works on battery power. I guess it's OK to use with batteries, but it sure didn't work with an AC adapter"
3,Good deal for the price,"The highlighted colored text makes this dictionary more usable than the ordinary dictionary. Kind of nice.The paper is not of high quality, though, so you wouldn't want to buy this for heavy use by multiple users."
1,Do not buy from this company,"Product was defective, wood surface had scratches on it, and it looked like someone had tried to stain over the scratches. Side doors for necklaces do not open, drawers stick and are hard to open."
3,Over priced for the quality,"I give this 3 stars only because from a distance it looks like a nice piece of furniture. However, I wouldn't give it any stars for the craftmanship. This arrived in a damaged box, all hardware missing and there was absolutely no care put in to this armoire. Obviously no quality control. Really, this company gave me the impression that they just didn't care. The drawers do not slide smoothly. You have to manually line the drawers up so they can be even. Just a real disappointment. Oh, I did have to take a cloth and some Pledge to clean it up. Save your money. Overpriced!"
3,I bought this ...,"I bought this flat bread maker thinking it would be a great addition to my kitchen.I was very disappointed. It does not bake evenly and the recipies that are included have to be altered quite a bit. All in all it was a big let down. If I had to do it over again, I would not!"
3,"Excellent source, a few gems but not a game changer","Bill George has an impeccable pedigree in management, however, there is a reserve and a distance to his writing that made me feel like this: while I may have been eavesdropping out in the hall to a locked-door meetings of the very top ranks of American business managers, everyone behind the door knew I was listening and they were all being very careful about what they said. Nice book for the bookshelf, a few pithy pieces but this is not a business book that made me rethink anything."
5,Defines what a leader and company should aspire to,"This book restored my faith in CEOs and corporate America, just knowing that there was one person in the world who could write a book this motivating. It also gave me a much better understanding of the pressures and choices that they have to make on a daily basis, while still trying to hold true to a company's mission and deliver value to shareholders.The only bad thing is that this made me a little bit depressed about my current place of employ; I couldn't tell you that I ""feel"" our mission, or even that I've ever met anybody above my current manager in the hierarchy to understand what they feel about it. Sure, I have my personal motivation, and my product has a mission, but as a company, I'd love to have what he brought to Medtronics."
3,unsolved mysteries,"fyi, since I didn't know this. I assumed this was a collection from the show unsolved mysteries like all the murder mysteries but it's not it's about the other specials they air like supernatural stuff. i was disappointed in what i received but I guess i shouldn't assume, because you know what they say about assuming. it makes an a s s out of u and me. assume."
4,"Very nice, but small","A well designed set of earrings, but like other reviewers said they are on the smaller side."
3,"3,5 stars",A nice album. Well not great or so good as Bloody kisses and October rust but nice. If you like their previous albums you will like some tracks in this album too. The formula is the same -> very slow tracks with gothic atposphere. But there are no tracks so good to make this album great (only 2 good tracks and the rest are average).
1,Everyone I Love is Dead (This CD killed them),In one word: dull. I like Type O when they dirge - SLOW DEEP & HARD still stands up as a great album. I like them when they rock. This time they just simply bored me. The lyrics don't seem as clever and the music is nowhere near as innovative as previous releases. Just boring.Wake me up when the next album comes out.
4,Deadly...good goth!,"If you like your death poetic,humorous,and slow a la Black Sabbath,then this is the album for you.Peter Steele & Co.made an instant classic for the genre-great guitars and keyboards creating an excellent atmosphere augmented by Steele's vocals are only the tip of the iceberg;a careful listen will reveal the subtlety and high-caliber musicianship of this excellent band.Probably one of the best releases of 1999,so go ahead,pull the plug..."
4,Great Game!,Excellent game-play and single player campaign. A few nice surprises along with all the features of previous Hitman games make for a very enjoyable and fun experience. Highly recommended!
3,Hit man - the game,"I haven't had a lot of oportunity to play the game as yet, although the few times I have played it has been enjoyable and interesting.It could use a simpler control interface, although thats just me being picky. Overall an interesting and entertaining game."
2,Misses the point,"I bought this book for a Gen Chem class and was somewhat surpised to see that a good deal of stuff we were learning was not even covered in this book. The information that is covered was very hard to understand the way it was written, esp the section on unit analysis which I think was the single most important thing to learn in the class because without it you cannot do any conversions. Do yourself a favor, save your money and go see some free videos on youtube (Khanacademy) because this book is junk."
3,"I liked it, but...","I bought this in October 2001. It worked much better than my previous under-counter can opener (the B&D; flipper one), but it wasn't long before the plastic by the blade broke. We fixed it with super glue, twice now; but it no longer sticks together, and now the plastic that holds the lid magnet is cracked as well.Maybe it's just me, but it seems like it should've lasted longer than it did as we don't use it daily. And HB really ought to offer replacement parts, as I was completely satisfied with it otherwise.I wouldn't mind paying more if they would just work well *and* LAST."
2,Great Toothbrush but....,"First of all, I agree with all the other reviewers that this is a fantastic toothbrush that will keep fillings away. In fact, it's so fantastic I have bought a total of 4 for myself and my family. However, if you are one of those people who apply ANY pressure on your teeth with the brush while it's working, be warned that the life of this unit is very very limited---the head of EVERY single one of our brushes broke off within 3 months of use!!! The company was remarkably unhelpful and unsympathetic! We now use the Oral B brush, which is almost as good and at least last long enough to go between dental appoointments."
2,Chintzy,"Yes, it's cheap (compared to others that hold the same capacity) but it's very chintzy and bad quality. The capacity is excellent for a cabinet this size, it's a great space saver and looks quite attractive. However, I would rather pay more for something that will last a long time rather than save money initially then have to dump it in a landfill after a few months because it is falling apart. The back of one of the drawers was already starting to come loose straight out of the box! Not a good sign! The problem is that it is just bits of cardboard, mdf and vinyl stuck together with glue, not built with any kind of longevity in mind.I would not recommend this. It is a false saving because you'll only end up having to buy another one in the near future. Save up and buy something decent instead (check out the Leslie Dame library style cd cabinets, I bought one on Amazon and it's very good quality and solid wood)."
4,Night Passage,"I find the title Night Passage to be a very good description for the mood of the music on the CD. I love listening to this CD as I am getting ready for bed or falling asleep. Most of the songs settle into a very soothing rhythm, which helps put the listener into a tranquil state of mind. My favorite songs are Oh Mama Bakudala, Summer Solstice, Yemaya, and Ise Oluwa. I also enjoy Dark of the Moon, I Have a Million Nightingales, Deep Peace, and (of course) We All Come from the Goddess.I also ownA Circle Is CastandFire Within. A Circle is Cast is the best of the 3 I have, with Night Passage barely beating out Fire Within for 2nd place. I recommend Night Passage to people who know they like Libana and probably already own A Circle is Cast."
3,Choose Your Ingredients Wisely,"This is incredibly handy, compact, and powerful. I've found that it's great for baking preparation, chopping nuts, mincing vegetables, and blending thicker sauces (My peanut sauce came out great!).However, there are a few problems I can't overlook:1.) Do not fill the processor more than half way (This reduces the capacity to about 2 cups) -- especially if you are making beverages or thin sauces. When you remove the canister to pour the contents out, the contents sometimes spill through the center of the canister (all over your kitchen counter), even if you have left in the blade attachment.2.) Ice is a no-go. I almost burnt out the motor trying to make margaritas. (I was on vacation and accidentally left my blender at home.)If you need a mini chopper select projects (e.g. baking, salad making), this is a good investment. However, if you need more flexibility and power, I would suggest buying a larger model."
2,Nothing like what I hoped for.,"I LOVE Relocation. It's somewhere in my top 10 cds of all time. I could not wait for Strange Exchange to come out and of course bought it the first day it was released without having heard one song. The album (with a few tracks that are the exception) is bad. It is nothing like what it could have and should have been. It's not good. It's slow and weird and boring. I always give albums many chances to persuade me to like them--but no matter how many times I listen to this one, it just reminds me more and more of how poor it really is. RELOCATION (their previous album) is awesome and deserves much praise! If you are deciding on which CD to get--have no doubts that Relocation is the better choice--no contest. It makes me sad that such a great band even made this (Strange Exchange) CD."
4,Good teaching video,"I was actually hoping to write a review on the seller and not so much on the video. Nest videos does a great job on their videos. It is a very good teaching video. A little expensive, but still very good. I took a short cut and ordered this used video through Amazon and even paid extra to have the shipping expedited. I got the video a day late, but thankfully we were still able to use it. The company never replied to me about the late delivery which is a little frustrating."
2,Nothing extraordinary,"This is similar to Orangina, only in very small bottles and more expensive. If you have orange juice and mineral water in your home, you can easily make your own, minus the sugar and preservatives."
2,"Not good for my dog, but good for wide receivers (?)","I bought this after an online recommendation to try it on my elderly dog's pads for increased traction on non-carpeted areas in our house. After an obligatory test on myself (definitely sticky stuff), I sprayed some on Roscoe's paws. We did not notice a difference like we did when putting on Woodrow Wear Power Socks (he loves these!)... Anyway, we were left with dirty paw prints on the tile floor where dirt has stuck to the residue.. We will stick to the socks..."
3,flat characters.,"I enjoy reading the courtroom scenes, but the characters are flimsy at best, and flat for the rest. Summing up the series so far:Book 1: Muslims bad. Christians good.Book 2: Muslims bad. Christians good. Jews might be OK.Book 3: Muslims bad. Gays bad. Christians good. Straights good. Media bad.I'm glad these were free on Kindle, else I'd think I was being ripped off. The courtroom scenes and drama are worth slogging through all the patronizing religious BS."
4,WOW...,Just finished reading Treason by Don Brown. This book was fascinating and held my interest throughout. I couldn't put it down. I had already read The Malacca Conspiracy by this author not knowing it was a series. That too was a terrific read which led me to this book. Both books were spellbinding and I intend to read the other books in this series in order. I can't say enough good things about this author and the way he relates his stories. I am very happy to have been introduced to his writings.
2,A bit thin in patches,Sections of the book are repeattive & a bit thin on substance. The plot is transparent from start to finish
2,silly lawyer stuff,"Not a bad plot as plots go, but Brown's idea of good lawyering is plain silly. Two stars only."
2,Only mediocre,"Very disappointed. The dual story lines got in the way--a rape trial vs. multiple murders and national security. The real possibilities that this very thing could, and probably is, happening made it very timely, but the author tended to ramble and I speed read those pages. Don Brown has lots of work to do to compete with Brad Thor or Vince Flynn."
1,Psuedo-Xtian Rubbish,"It didn't take long to figure out this book was more than a court room drama. As the ""Muslim bad, Christian good"" stereotypes piled up page after page, I realized this was just one more of the Xtian fiction tripe that infects the free section on Kindle.blech. Stilted prose, boring stereotypes and wooden dialogue...............a must miss.I deleted it after about 50 pages.Too bad Kindle's list doesn't break out Christian fiction so the rest of us can give it a wide berth."
1,blech,"After getting 20 % through this book I had to stop. Even as a Christian I found this book offensive. I want my money back and I would like a warning next time that the book found in the ""thriller"" section should have been placed next to Coulter and Palin's stuff. Again, blech."
4,Liked it a lot,"I enjoyed this book very much - very exciting. It did seem to get a little ""preachy"" with all the positive references to Christianity that increased as the book went along, but I enjoyed it nevertheless."
1,Completely underwhelming,"It was free on Kindle, so I downloaded it, mistakenly thinking it was by DAN Brown, not DON Brown. The ""thriller"" bit of this is not remotely thrilling, and it it really doesn't become more so just because the author would have you believe so. How basically stupid and obvious does the token love interest really have to be? This plumbs new depths. And then there is this simply awful over-layering of pseudo Christianity. Completely out of place, alien to what little story there is and dragging down even further the already trite nature of this rubbish. The characters in the book aren't really - they simply have no character at all. I would defy anyone to care what actually happens to any of them.And why should one have to give any stars at all to something one thinks is complete nonsense? I understand that one star is less than five, but I simply don't want to award any and would rather warn people off wasting their money on this."
3,Early Ahmad Jamal,"I became an instant fan of Ahmad Jamal the moment (back in the early 60's) I heard his classic and iconic version of Poinciana recorded Live at The Pershing. This group of recordings capture Jamal at the beginning of his long career and before he evolved into the more mature, brilliant, complex and unique jazz pianist. There are 21 cuts on this album most of which are less than three minutes long with the exception of Love For Sale (8:30). I was not sure what to expect but I thought it would compliment my other Ahmad Jamal albums."
2,Not based on manga,I want my money back they cut out the main character from they manga. I was thinking he was coming in later but no they changed everything. I wished the dvd had a different name.
5,A MUST READ FOR ANY 13 YEAR OLD!,"A must read, fantastic, awesome book! The plot keeps you hanging until the very end, which THROWS YOU OFF YOUR SEAT! This is defiantly a must HAVE!!!! :)"
4,Good product,"Good product and a must to go along with the retractable dryer lines. Be ready to dig a BIG hole and have gravel and concrete on hand. I permanently mounted mine by putting the bottom metal section into concrete and then pouring concrete into the bottom section. This gives the best stability. It was a little loose in the enclosed plastic mounting piece but if you want to remove the pole when not in use, it does work. Mounting the line holder on the top of the pole requires a little dexterity as you have to place a nut inside the pole. Luckily I have long fingers."
2,Handles broke after only 2 weeks of use.,"It makes great sandwiches, unfortunately handles can not take much force which you have to apply if you want to put more than one slice of cheese in your sandwich. I would stay clear of this product."
3,Makes good grilled cheese but...,"I bought this to take to college to make grilled cheese, omellettes, and grilled sandwhiches in my dorm room. It does all three better than a toaster oven, however it is very hard to clean! If just a little piece of cheese goes over the edge its very difficult to clean. also, if you don't use cooking spray or butter, stuff sticks sometimes. When cleaning the ""non stick"" cooking surfaces are difficult as well, they also seem to be coated in butter or spray no matter how many times you wash them. I gave up on this product and get a skillet."
2,"Horrible, my kid hated it","Horrible, my kid hated it and he loves most puzzles. Pieces do not fit easy and it hard to figure out where a piece go because all pieces are exactly the same size and shape."
5,Educational Wooden Puzzle,"This was purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. He's probably a little too young yet, but he's already mastered many of Melissa and Doug puzzles. I think he needs a challange."
2,"Jack of all trades, master of none.","I was given this skillet as a gift, and I'm glad that I didn't pay for it. While the lower half is passable as a griddle (it heats well, has a nice nonstick surface, and is stable on a countertop), its limited cooking area makes it hard to make more than a few small pancakes or a eggs at a time -- not what you want in an electric griddle (otherwise, you'd use a pan, right?).As an electric skillet, it's decidedly below average. The removable skillet design slows heating, and it's often difficult to achieve simmering temperatures, even with the lid on. Forget simmering with the lid off, because you'll be waiting all day. As a result, it's a terrible braising device -- it's difficult to brown the food, and hard to maintain a simmer.I would only recommend this skillet to those who are very limited on kitchen space. Otherwise, for about the same price you can buy both a quality electric skillet, AND an electric griddle."
5,Outstanding Skillet,"I have had this skillet for 7 years now and it has never failed me. I have literally used it hundreds of times and food always comes out great. I usually wash the upper part in the dishwasher and still shows no signs of wear. I highly recommend this to any family that needs to cook for an army! Getting ready to buy another one, just in case they ever decide to stop making them."
4,Great value collection,If only I'd thought of some of these tricks in my childhood battles with my sister. If you love Horrid Henry what could be better than getting three lots in one book - especially since a single book doesn't take my daughter long to get through. Great value - especially since she's now read it through 3 times!
5,Refreshing change for Punk,"Punk has gotten kinda boring over the last few years basically because it's all starting to sound the same. The only punk cds I listen to anymore are Anti-Flag, NOFX, and to an extent I guess The Offspring's older stuff could be considered punk. But AMEN has done something wonderful in a dying genre, they made their own sound. IT'S CRAZY I tell you. Loud, fast, and most importantly angry. AMEN comes out of nowhere to make their mark on music, it's its a good mark at that. Best tracks are, Coma America, Fevered, and When a Man Dies A Woman."
5,"One Word ""Brilliant""","Amen are fast furious all power metal, with great songs such as Coma America and Everything is Untrue, this cd is one of the best debuts i have heard, buy it if you like Slipknot"
4,I give it 4.5---> Very Good Book,"This book was about a coming of age fantasy. Tria has just entered into The school for sorcery and nothing is as she expected. The teachers are dull, just like the school and the students are strange especially a mysterious boy - Oryon, who wants to be the most powerful one, he kidnaps her boyfriend and her and her troublesome roommate Lina must rescue him in a year or they'll never be seen again.........It's a very good book, It's hard to put down, I can't wait to read the other book by this author ""A Perilous Power"""
4,Great waffle maker!,This waffle iron works great! It cooks each waffle perfect and clean up is a snap. The non-stick coating works great. The part that you touch to open the iron gets a little hot. The price was awesome and shipping free with the Amazon free super saver shipping. Another satisfied customer!
4,Works very well,"Can't get any more simple than this. Plug it in. Light goes on. Mix your batter. Light goes off. Lift the lid and pour. Close the lid. Light comes back on. Wait about 5 to 8 minutes depending on how think you poured. Light goes out. Gently lift out with a fork. Perfect!!Be sure to spray lightly with Pam for best results. When it cools, wipe with damp cloth. Don't immerse of course! Since I use mine every weekend I just wipe it down and store with a paper towel inbetween. (Every now and then will use a little soap to clean.)Very satisfied for the price. If it beeped at you when done I would have given this product 5 stars :)"
4,Good product at a good price.,Heats up fast. Even heat. Cleans fairly easy.It would get 5 stars if the plates were removable.
2,Disappointed with this product,The waffles are not fully cooked when the light goes off. It is HARD to clean because the iron isn't removable. It needs a bell or something because the indicator light is dim.
5,I Love Waffles,"I make so many waffles now like probably a billion a day. But yeah, this waffle maker is super easy to use and if you don't forget to use non-stick spray like I did once (#hottmess) then it's also no probs to clean."
4,great for at home waffles for two,"You need to tweak your recipe a bit to work best with this machine, but this baker works well! Not a high output, but great for couple waffles on a sunday morning. I like mine a bit bit crisp on the outside so I leave em in a little longer than suggested in the instructions."
5,a pleasure to use,"I chose this waffle maker after reading a lot of reviews here on Amazon. Though I haven't had it long, I'm very satisfied with it. The price is very reasonable. It takes up little storage space, as it is designed to stand up on it's end. The instructions are clear, it is easy to use, and easier to clean than I expected. I worried it would be hard to tell when the waffles were done - they take 5 minutes every time, but if they needed longer, it would work fine to close the irons again. And fresh waffles are so much better than frozen."
5,Awesome,"This waffle maker is very good at exactly what it does. It makes waffles and comes with soem recipes on the inside pamphlet. Its very easy to clean and the non-stick is non-stick so no worries there. It cooks very fast and the waffles turned out delicious so all in all it was great. It also stands up and is small enough to tuck away somewhere. For the price, definitely worth it as well."
2,Made good waffles until it stopped working,This one replaced an Oster that broke after a year and a half. This one lasted less than half as long. On to another brand.
5,Inexpensive and cooks beautifully!,"It's great to find a product that performs, especially one that is so reasonably priced. Just follow the directions for perfect waffles, from the very first one. We really like sourdough waffles and my homemade batter cooks to perfection - crisp on the outside and creamy inside. 3/4 cup of batter fills all the grill without running over. Great value for your money."
4,Great from the start!,"This is a great waffle maker. I've never had any problems with the waffles sticking, and I don't use cooking spray. (I did oil it down before the very first use). It takes a little while for it to warm up, but if you start it before you start the waffle batter, it will be ready when you are. It doesn't have a timer, but it really doesn't take long to fully cook the waffles. I'd definitely recommend this as a great buy!"
4,Great product for the price,"Makes great waffles with deep pockets; crispy on outside and tender inside. It stands vertically when not in use, so it takes up little storage space. Heats quickly and cooks quickly. And you can't beat the price. The only reason I didn't give it 5-stars is because it lacks an indicator light to show when the waffle is done--so you have to monitor it carefully!"
3,"Good, but not what I expected",I was expecting the large professional model that one sees in restaurants and soda fountains. The one I received is a scaled down version but it is an excellent product. It makes great malts/shakes but the mixing canister is not as large as the professional model. I should have known when the picture showed it to be all-chrome. The professional model is a very pale greenish color. Maybe I can find one on ebay.
1,Worse Product,This was a terrible product. The motor burned up on the 2nd use. Would never recomend this product.
1,Very Disapointed,It is advertized to make ice cream shakes and don't do squat when it comes to ice cream...I ordered on the internet because I couldn't find Hamilton Beach in my area...In the past Hamilton beach has been what I liked best and always chosen...I'm very disapointed with the results and I gave it for a gift which in my opinion makes it even worse...Hamilton Beach needs to step up to the plate and correct this or improve their porducts...I've been buying Hamilton Beach products for 40 years...Plus now I'm very disapointed with internet shopping next time I'll buy local so it can be returned easily....Thank you asking my opinion
4,what you see is what you get,I am glad I purchased it. For the price --it works well. Ice cream needs to be soft but it makes a nice shake. The rotator blade is plastic and not equipped for anything heavy duty like ice or hard fruit. It does a good basic job of mixing and blending. If you keep it in the context of economical-it does what it says and I would buy it again. If you want more power then you will need to spend more money on a heavy duty one!
