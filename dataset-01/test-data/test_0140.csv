5,Loving this box!,"Ive only had this box for a couple weeks, but so far I am loving it! Makes for a much quicker clean up than with a traditional box. Havent had any problems with litter leaking out or anything. Fingers crossed that nothing will break! :)"
3,It's okay,"I was really excited about this, I hate shoveling cat litter but I still have too because every time I flip it over the litter spills out through the cracks"
5,Innovative!,"Who would have thunk! This is a genius design. You do need to have room to roll it, but in less than 20 seconds, you can clean this litter pan without having to get too close to the used litter. Just have a bucket handy to dump the used litter into. I line my bucket with a bag so it's easy to remove and put in the barrel on trash day. I have recommended this to my family and friends. It is WELL worth the price."
1,Sloppy design,The box does not fit together easily even on initial assembly. The inner pieces do not line up properly so the lid would not clip on.Sloppy design - lack of compatible measurements.A disappointing waste of money.
4,Great idea.,"I just put the box together today, and have already tried it out. It works great. You roll the box and the clumps go into the bin. My only con so far are the clips. They are not easy for me to move. We have three cats that use the same box. We change litter once a week. I'm not looking forward to dealing with the clamps every week. One of our cats has odd pee and it makes the litter stick to the back of the box. I'm not sure how I'm going to manage scrapping the box everyday without taking the lid off. We'll see. With all that said, I'm still very excited about this cat box.Tip: roll the cat box over until it's just about upside down, then roll it back to the upright position and roll it the other way so the litter can fall back into the main area."
1,BAD!,"I think the idea of the product is really good, how ever, It needs a door, my cat does not like going without a litter door.My litter box was lacking the clips that maintain the litter box closed, so all the sand goes out of the box. I contact the manufacturer 2 weeks ago and they said they were going to send the clips, today, they still haven't send anything. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"
1,"Dirty product, better off using a scoop!","I bought the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box being so excited that I would not have to scoop poop. Initially, I was pretty impressed with the product as it only required me to tip the box. No pooper scooper! Yet after using it for a while, I realized how dirty the product got from tipping it to empty out litter cakes and feces. Poop smears and clay litter smears were all along the side. I even think that because the scent of my cat's excretions were all over one side of the litter box, he sprayed inside the litter box on the other side of it. Let's not even mention the horrors of this litter box when my cat had loose stool. I have since taken out the sifting screen and tray and bought a litter scoop. I much prefer scooping the poop then sifting and knocking his feces and pee cakes into a tray!"
2,Not what I expected,"I read all the positive reviews and hoped for the very best, but was disappointed. I'm basically using this box like any other covered box - removing the top, scooping out messes, adding litter and replacing the top. The bad doesn't get seperated from the good as it should, so I still have to do it myself. Oh well..."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","My boyfriend got this for me as a gift to make cleaning the litter box for our two cats a bit easier. I love the idea, but in reality the thing doesn't save time and has actually caused more frustration because it leaks when you roll it over. At first it only leaked a little, and I checked the locks and re-secured it and it was okay for a few more turns. Then , it started leaking more and more, to the point where I would have to vacuum every time I used it. Now I'm afraid to roll the darn thing over and have just gone back to scooping (which I don't really mind doing, anyway--it's certainly less messy than this thing!)."
2,Not recommended,"After using this case for a while, I found the top cover did not close properly as it did when I purchased it. The top cover can either slip inside, or to the outside of the lip on the top left hand side of the case. I am referring to the small metal tab, that supports the case cover when closed, located to the left and above the Axim device lock button, when your Axim is in the case. This poor fit causes the Axim to get squeezed a bit, at the point where the Axim microphone is. The case is not properly designed to ensure that this pinching or squeezing does not occur. The case also has no secure locking mechanism, to prevent the case from popping open if you should drop it. This would potentially expose your Axim to screen damage."
4,Jerry's latest thoughts on this music,"Goldsmith conducts these pieces with great feeling, in many cases providing new insight into his own intentions or preferences for how this music should or can feel, absent the requirements of the movie itself or its creators.One example is the Star Trek theme, in which the latter part of the main theme starts as a whisper and then swells to full volume.Just for the insights it provides through his conducting, this disc is a must-have for Goldsmith fans."
4,A Different Application,"I recently purchased an Onkyo NR708 which on it's 'Audessey' mode allows for 'front high' and 'front wide' speaker applications in additon to normal 7.1 speaker placements. Because I did not wish to do a permanent 'in-wall' installation I chose to mount these Polks (as 'front wides')on the front my very wide entertainment unit...one left and one right of the 50"" TV and about two feet above the left and right floor standing speakers (old Pioneer HPM 100's). I built simple speaker boxes for them (out of 1x4 pine for the sides, top and bottom and 1x12 pine for the backs. I then stained the pine to the colour of the cabinet and spray painted the speaker grills flat black. They look terrific and they sound great on Onkyo's Audessy front wide modes. They are a little 'bassy' in their enclosures which I like. I left it up to Onkyo's auto cal system to set them up. Perfect for what I needed and I couldn't be happie with them."
3,Interesting.....,"I have just put down Rita Ciresi's Pink Slip, after reading it from cover to cover. The book is insightful and very engaging. However, I found that Ciresi's character development to be a bit confusing. First of all, the main character, Lisa, has a very close relationship with her cousin, Dodie. Dodie happens to be gay, and although the book seems to have been written rather recently, the use of stereotypes and cliches centered on homosexuality is rampant. Furthermore, Lisa, our protagonist, has recently cleaned up her act, after years of promiscuity and drug abuse. However, we are never really given the reason for her conversion. Ciresi also makes it hard for us to believe that such an intelligent, outspoken woman as Lisa is so incredibly uncomfortable and unsure of herself. How can one be so opinionated and outspoken if one has no confidence in their own beliefs?"
5,"Heart felt, thoughtful, and funny","The pains and humor of friendship, family, and the road to love and sex are very compelling in this novel. I immediatly felt a kinship and empathy for Lisa Diodetto and fell in love with Eben Strauss and their struggle for companionship and acceptance.I loved this book and it illustrated beautifully that the road to love is painful atimes and rewarding.This is the first novel I have read by Rita Cerisi and was very impressed with the full characterization, original dialogue between characters, and the instant feeling of truth. I will read more of her work and the follow up to Pink Slip."
4,"well written. liked the book , didn't like the characters.","First of all, this book was incredibly well written. I liked the author's style and how she'd spring things on the reader in an entertaining and haphazard way. It keeps you on your toes. I finished the book last nite and I'm not sure if I like the characters. I definitely do not like Strauss. His arrogance and bossiness would drive me up a wall. (Whenever he called her ""Lisar"" -- I would just cringe.) Lisa was okay. I found her incredibly selfish and a real pain in the derriere, yet I felt for her. But, I don't have to like the characters in order to like book. The author's style conveyed very well Lisa's love for Strauss and I was rooting for her all along. I'd reccomend it to anyone."
1,Despised this book,"This is the first of Rita Ciresi's books I've read. I doubt I'll try any more.The worst thing about this book is 'Lisar' the main character - annoying, ignorant, self-involved, stupid, whiny, and dull. She seems to have no problem sleeping around with every guy she comes across, even having sexual fantasies about her own dead father, and then blames her boyfriend when he can't take her past. Nothing is ever her fault, only everyone else's. She has no friends whatsoever, except her gay male cousin, who is as vacuous, dull and stereotypical as she is. And for the entire book, all she does is complain - about her parents, her boyfriend, her life, her job, her boss, the dumb jock (that she still comes on to, even though she can't stand him) her size zero body etc. etc. Trite and boring!The second worst thing about this book are all the other characters - every one of them is such a cliche it's very difficult to swallow. Poor writing indeed.A huge disappointment."
3,For Diehard Petula Clark Fans,"This compilation of Petula Clark recordings from the 1970s consists of covers of hit songs by the likes of Hank Williams, Peter, Paul & Mary, Neil Sedaka, Bread, Shirley Bassey, and the Spanish group Mocedades, among others. They're not bad covers, Petula Clark's voice is as good as usual, but they're not that great either. Ms. Clark and the producers seemed to have been playing it safe with these recordings. Still, the CD is cheap and, except for the self-penned songs that are missing, this collection provides a good overview of Ms. Clark's 1970s English-language recordings. If you really like Petula Clark's voice, you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, I'd recommend you skip this one and get the original recordings."
4,"Reads like graduate thesis, not a ""Field Guide""","This book is well written and an asset to someone interested in learning about transracial adoption POLICY AND THEORY(which also implies issues of welfare reform, illegitimacy, and institutional race/classism)from W.W. II to the 1990's. The author, herself an adoptee, interviewed 22 transracial adoptees (primarily Mid West and West Coast) and has included some of their comments in the text.Personally, I was seeking more of a ""Field Guide"" of difficult situations that prospective transracial adoptive parents or the adoptees might encounter and HOW to engage those issues in a proactive and sensitive manner. This was an interesting read (like a graduate student's thesis about institutional racism), but not quite what I was looking for."
3,"Still great, but not their best","Any Police album should be bought but while this album has some of the best Police songs ever recorded, such as ""Message in a Bottle"", ""Regatta de Blanc"" and ""Walking on the Moon"" it also has some of the worst, ""On Any Other Day"", ""Contact"" and ""No Time This Time"". Unfortunately Sting ran out of songs and had to rely on Stewart Copeland for some fillers and while they are at times funny, the songs are really b-side type material. Get any other Police album first and then get this one last."
5,The Police at their best.,"This is The Police at their best. Beautifully written songs, oustanding musicianship, wonderful interplay between Sting, Copeland and Summers, and great production (warm, clean and spare). Here they are before Sting's ego got the better of him, when they were tight and all enjoying themselves. Stuart Copeland really shines here--listen to the title track, ""It's All Right"" and ""No Time This Time;"" he's easily as talented and fun to listen to as John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) or Keith Moon (The Who) or Ginger Baker (Cream), though he's more understated than any of them. This one's a keeper."
4,chill out!,"I really enjoyed the book even though I had watched the video before reading the book. Lighthearted, easy read, just chill book. We take life too seriously sometimes and Anita Renfroe helps us look at the 'other side' of life. She touched on some of my favorites, like ""Hot Now""! I wish I was one of her buddies to tag along to the beach, I'm sure it would be fun as well as relaxing. Don't stop reading part way through if you don't like the jokes--be diligent and finish the book. You'll be glad you did."
5,Just What I Needed,"I saw Anita ""live"" which was a big motivator to me to purchase the book at the event. Laugh out loud humor. I'm a hard person to please in the laughter department. Anita brings it out in me and helps my relationship grow with Christ. Christ meant for us to laugh and he has gifted Anita. I read in the morning and her descriptions gave me such a visual. What fun. I lead a book club and we are including her latest ""If Its Not One Thing, Its Your Mother"" for one of our monthly reads. Keep writing and doing what you're doing Anita. Love it."
1,Can't finish,"The movie is not engaging,The acting is not realistic, You have actors doing a bad job of playing actors ... you just can't believe the actors."
4,Best Value for Price,"I selected the Archos on the basis that I could also use the unit as an external Hard Drive. For the price, the Archos GMini 120 gave the largest hard drive capacity when compared to the iPod and the players from Dell and Samsung. I had no problems with the unit being recognized by Win XP, and I upgraded the unit's system software from v1.2 to v1.5 with no difficulty. The controls and menus are functional and logical although the buttons are slightly hard. My player runs 8.5 hours on a full charge, but I get occasional error messages during the last half-hour of use when playing WMA music files (it says there is something wrong with the file). The included ear buds are good, but I prefer my Sony ear buds which give a richer sound. Fit and finish is adequate. The hard drive inside is extremely quiet. I am not interested in the extra cost features so that has not been a problem for me. Overall, this has been a happy experience so far."
1,john doe,okay i bought the archos gmini 120 as an alternative of the extremely over priced ipod. and since im 15 and had to pay for it myself it seemed logical to buy an mp3 player that offered a great amount of space and features for a fraction of the cost of an ipod that i couldnt afford. so i got the gmini and immeditly opened it and tried to get it running... well 6 days of trying later it still wasnt working. the plugins are immposible to use and no one knows how to make it work. not only does it not work with itunes or just work period its huge and cannot fit in your pocket if you tried... so if you have bought this return it and get something that works...
2,Not worth it....,I bought this a month ago because it played three formats of audio... good idea but it doesn't work. It seems that it does NOT play WAV files at all. The screen went dead after two weeks and it doesn't play more than seven hours without a charge. I would be cautious recommending this to anyone.
4,"Good product, not without its quirks","Does everything as advertised and does it well -- no errors transferring CF cards, good battery life, decent MP3 player. Other people have critisized the web site and marketing niche, but this has nothing to do with the product itself.The fact is that at the time of writing this is the only MP3 player/ CF card reader in its price range. If you need only one of these, look elsewhere. If you can wait 6 months for better and cheaper products, do so. If not get the Gmini and you won't regret it. I'm taking mine to India in a week!"
1,Nice Plastic toy but doesnt work,"Bought to replace an old Archos Jukebox Recorder, wish I had never bothered.1) Freezes and locks out2) Display is always corrupting even occasionaly appears backwards.3) Battery life is nothing like they state.4) Photo plug in useless will not work with large cards or large files.I personely think this is the biggest waste of money, Archos technical help is a waste of time.Now sits in the car where if I have had a bad day at work I use it as stress releiver. Doesnt bounce well though.Gave it one star cos it looks cute"
4,Great Photo Wallet!!,"I got this to store my photos. Dedicated photo wallets while slightly cheaper don't perform nearly as well. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to invest in lots of digital memory. With the built in compact flash slot who could ask for more.. except maybe a replacable hard drive, oh well.."
2,Not a Second Charlotte Church,"Usually I'm not a big fan of singers who put out albums when their voices haven't matured yet, say Charlotte Church for instance, but I have to admit when I got this cd from the library I was really impressed not only with her vocal ability but also the fact that she does not try to make herself appear older, in her singing, than she is. Her songs are all relevant to her age, and she sings them as a young girl, very simply and very sweetly. If Charlotte Church had taken this approach she would have been better off, I believe. As to what Aselin does with her voice in the future, we shall see..."
2,"Appalling sound quality, great historical document","If you're into the whole tropicalia mythology, then you must at least listen to this album... That being said, I didn't keep my copy... It's a reference work, rather than an album that's fun to listen to..."
1,OH MY GOD!,"What a waste of film stock! This adaptation of John Knowles overrated novel about a 2 boys in a boarding school during WWII, is pure agony. The dialogue is awful, the acting amaturish and who edited this thing, Ed Wood? Read the book if you have to, but avoid this flop at all costs. This is the kind of film that makes studios go bankrupt. But if your looking for something better, (a story with an actual meaning) in place of this movie go with Au Revoir les Enfantes. You'll see top-notch child acting and Louis Malle at his very, very best."
2,English Teacher's Review,"Wow. My sophomores begged me to turn this off. What a disappointment. I saw better ""After School Specials"" when I was growing up. I might recommend this for my ESL students, but it was pure agony for me.What a bad movie."
5,Awesome and Powerful Book,"This book is awesome...simply awesome! I felt present during the dialogue and Sally's powerful personality came alive. The relationship between Rebecca and Sally and the many questions it raised kept me reading until the early hours of the morning...intriguing, mysterious and a good read."
4,VCI edition just fine,"As I've been trying to collect some classic serials, I've been frustrated by the lack of specific information on the various editions. So let me first say that while the print is far from pristine, for the price this VCI edition is hard to beat.Second, let me say that I am astonished--to the point of feeling like my 10-year old self was had--how much of ""Star Wars"" Lucas lifted almost whole-cloth from this serial. Even the prologue as a steeply pitched crawl comes from Buck Rogers, not to mention countless scenes in the Millennium Falcon as the ship is chased by an evil-empire-like force of villains.So here's the advice I would have been happiest to have had a few days ago when I was trying to decide whether to buy this disc: if you love science fiction on film, or are interested in the popular culture of the late 30's and early 40's, BUY THIS DISC."
4,One small complaint,"The restoration and quality of the picture is outstanding. This is the best DVD version of Buck Rogers that has ever been and likely will ever be released. One small quibble -- as far as I can tell the picture is interlaced. Why, oh WHY, go to all the trouble and expense to restore this serial from film and then release it interlaced???"
3,Buster Crabbe's Only Go-Round as Buck Rogers,"Universal's 1939 adaptation of ""Buck Rogers"" is no match for the ""Flash Gordon"" cliffhangers. Buster Crabbe's space heroics are still fun to watch, but this 12-chapter serial suffers from erratic pacing and weak villains. Compared to the ruthless Emperor Ming, dictator Killer Kane (horribly portrayed by Anthony Warde) wouldn't pass muster in a ""B"" gangster movie. Despite her limited screen time, Constance Moore makes an effective Wilma Deering - while Jackie Moran is a definite plus as Buck's youthful sidekick. A mixed intergalactic bag, ""Buck Rogers"" proved only a moderate success with Saturday Matinee audiences. Not surprisingly, the studio rejected a follow-up and opted for Crabbe's return in ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"" (1940)."
5,Bullseye plush durable,"I recently purchased this plush Bullseye for my daughter after searching store after store and even online and couldn't find one anywhere. After reading reviews about the plastic version, I was definitely not going to purchase the plastic one that immediately fell apart. I highly recommend this plush version of Bullseye because it is soft for my daughter to carry around and sleep with and it has posable legs so it stands upright with Jessie doll riding on him...PERFECT!!! This vendor sent Bullseye immediately so I was very pleased with the quick shipment."
4,Functional product for a low price when I picked them up! You may want to put these on your watch list and keep an eye on the $$,I needed new screw inserts / backers since the other ones were old and stripped and saw amazon carried this. I figure why not purchase these from here since I was ordering anyways. In the end they were just as shown and worked fine....plus I didn't have to go out to a auto store and pay a higher price like most would sell these! It was a double win in my eyes! You never know what they carry on here so I know I'll be checking around for other random products I need anytime I order from now on.
4,An essential for any early punk fans,"This is a highly unusual and artisticly revealing cinematic pleasure. If anyone has seen director Derek Jarman's films before, you probably know that he doesn't follow the conventions of film narrative. For punk fans it offers a view of the wasteland fantasy world that isn't too far off from the truth. Early glimpses of Adam Ant(the soon to be Mtv poster boy looking very young), Little Nell (Rocky Horror Picture Show), and Ian Charleson (Chariots of Fire). For any fan of the Sex Pistols' movie, ""THe Great ROck and ROll Swindle""- this movie is perfect for you. IT contains lots of nudity- both male and female and has alot of questionable acts of violence. Not recommended for everyone- but definitely a rare treat."
2,not at all what i expected,"i had a lot of trouble watching this, partly because it made no sense and partly because it wasn't interesting at all. a coherent storyline isn't really that essential for me, i enjoy david lynch. even though lynch rarely makes much sense his films are beautiful and hold your attention. technically jubilee was fair, visually it was okay. i ususally trust the criterion company with their releases but this is one of the few that i recommend against."
2,Moments of pleasure - but mostly hard to watch,I find it easy to overlook the fact that a film like Pasolini's - 'Salo' is hard to watch. That is because 'Salo' is one of the most rewarding and deeply effecting films ever made - but Jubilee does not contain these rewards for me. I sat and tried to watch this film with an open mind - and saw some very good things about it - Jarman is without a doubt an exceptional talent - but as a whole I simply did not enjoy this film.
3,Unreliable suspense...,"A small boy is found dead after a fall from the roof of a tall building. It also seems odd that the foot steps in the snow lead in a straight pattern toward the edge of the roof. The neighbor, Smilla, decides to investigate the death of the boy closer and it appears that it is more than the accident that the police force and others want her to think. They try to stop her investigation into the death by threat and force, and it becomes apparent that it is not an accident. Smilla's Sense of Snow is a film that looses its grip on the audience by presenting obvious hints which the main character clearly misses."
5,Great Suspense Filled Movie,I received this movie in excellent condition and very promptly. I am very happy with the service. I will be ordering again.This is one of my favorite movies. Thankyou
2,"Typical ""Mainstream"" book.","This book is abit of a bore and turnoff with all it tips and trixs to create scripts that will please the ""buyer"". It is colored with a tone of a moral panic that is typical for experts that clame to know what people want and don't want. I think it is safe to say that if the creators of ""South Park"" or ""The Simpson"" would have read this book and followed it, thoose series would have never been made - maybe not even Bambi with its horrid shooting of bambis mother?It also deals with animation at its simplest blocks, it tries to show the steps to a finished product - poorly. It does contain a good hint here and there but as a hole it is a complete waist of time, and a poor candidate for a book to understand the teqnical aspects of animation. If you have some basic knowleadge of character, animation and storyboarding and want to learn how to write for animation, buy books about writing instead.>RS"
1,"NO stars for gutter trash, i.e. Neverending Story II","If the first one never ended, why did they make a second one? Neverending Story II is a mindless profit piece aimed at kids with no imagination or attention span. Full to the brim with rehashed unimaginative plot lines and dumbed down dialogue, this sequel proves to be nothing more than a forgettable summer entertainment film. The poor quality of this flick does a disservice to the original The Neverending Story, which was an enchanting work of art and one of my favorite movies."
1,The Neverending Story 2: The Lousy Sequel,"I thought that this was a terrible sequel. Why did they had to make a second one with different actors? In my opinion, I think this second one wasn't very good. I thought the first one was more exciting then this one. I also thought the movie was more like the Wizard of Oz. This is why give this movie one star."
4,A lot of nostalgia at a great price!,"I won't review the movies, because chances are if you are looking at this, you've already seen them.The special effects have long since been the spectacle they were when the movies were released, but that doesn't stop the power of the story of a boy looking for an escape from his everyday problems. Imaginative, uplifting and fun it's quite the bargain.The second movie doesn't quite have the power of the first, but if nothing else it is enjoyable to visit new locations in Fantasia and meet new characters."
4,Its quite a unique tale,"Ok so every is slating this and comparing it the first which was indeed a masterpeice. However, i did enjoy this movie. Yes the cast has been totally re-cast bar the bookseller (which was proberly his only movies). Jonathan Brandis plays Bastian this time round. A very talented actor who has now sadly passed away (2003). During this movie shows he could have done the first one too. Its like a totally different story than the first, which indeed is what its ment to be. The whole feeling is crazier than the first which was mainly in a world just like ours. I think the first was based on earth before time whereas the second is based on earth after time as passed. Anyway, this movie i enjoyed very much but don't go watching expecting the first cause its not ment to be. However, if your into fantasy then this movie is quite an enjoyment to view."
1,I would rate it below one!,"I am a huge Neverending Story fan. I have read the book many times and the movie is pretty good, too. The problem is that the first movie only tells half of the story. So imagine how excited I was to find that there was the second one! And imagine my disappointment to find out it really stunk! It had different characters, different story.. nothing was the same. Stick with the book and the first movie!"
4,Good,I liked it growing up as a kid and now my 3 kids like it. The first one better. Amazing how child hood movies have changed!
2,why did they do this?,i used to watch the first ns like a million times on video cassette. the horse sinking in the mud always made me cry but now i would probably find it funny. when i got an exercise bike i started thinking of all the movies i used to like that i could watch while exercising. this came as a bundle with nsI and it made me want to break the dvd over my knee. or throw it out the window. what makes sequels so painful? i don't know but this one is one of the painfullest. i tried to love it for it's badness. kind of like the way you can love krull or legend. nope. didn't work.
3,I think the original was better.,This movie wasn't as good as the original but I still enjoy watching it.
4,sequel to the very commonly used first course,"Karlin and Taylor wrote a classic text on stochastic processes in their ""A First Course in Stochastic Processes"". The second edition of that text was published in 1975.This sequel came out in 1981. It is not only a second course but it is also intended as a second volume on a larger course in stochastic processes. The authors show that they are continuing from the first course by picking up with Chapter 10 after the first book ended with Chapter 9. Many of the topics in the first book are continued in this text including Markov chains and Diffusions. Heavy emphasis is placed on point processes and their applications including Poisson and compound Poisson processes, population growth models and queueing processes."
1,not as advertised,"This phone was advertised as having caller id, but when it arrived it was just a plain phone."
3,"Me llamo Luka, yo vivo en el piso dos...","Many moons ago, I heard this chick trying to sing a Spanish version of her song ""Luka."" It really made me cringe like nothing other has since. Try to imagine Wayne Newton singing in Creole or something. It was really bad.As for the rest of this album, it's not bad in a sort of has-been, washed up sort of a way. Same sort of category of Edie Brickell, Cowboy Junkies, etc. I mean that in a, was-good-at-the-time-only-in-very-limited-quantities-at-that kind of fashion. Vega was by no means a Kirsty Maccoll (R.I.P.) who she seems to have fashioned herself after, even trying to hook up with Billy Bragg as it were. But, I guess she was marginally ok at what she did, for the limited time she did it.Dig it up for the novelty of it all, try to find the Spanish version and laugh/cringe/cry, and then shove it back in the attic."
3,disappointing,"As much as I enjoy a good right-wing nut bashing book, I must say that I was disappointed by this particular book. It just wasn't academically rigerous enough for me."
4,was a sleeper see it,this was a documentary movie about what is going on today in our world . we must be aware of the things that are going on today and will be part of us if we dont get it and stop another Holcaust. It is about current events and how we must not stand against this evil .
2,Don't buy it,"If I could have touched it first, i wouldnt have purchased it. Very cheaply made - the lid is plastic and hollow. I think the handle is too. You can barely get your fingerprints off The top. It kinda keeps the coffee warm. Should have cost $20 not $80. Very over priced and cheap. I wrote to the company only to hear nothing from them. And I think I've maybe written and complained about something twice in my 60 years of life."
3,Bodum Thermal Press Pot Review,It is beautiful if you like high design. It is less functional than I'd like - not sure the trade off is worth it in the long run (I purchased a drip machine subsequently). The pourer allows grains to get in the coffee cup and the pot doesn't empty - always 1/2 cup or more in the pot when I think it is empty.
3,Doesn't keep coffee hot,"I love the French Press and the Bodum stainless steel pot has a much nicer look that the glass versions, but the 'thermal' qualities here are a bit of a stretch. Keep in mind this is not a thermos, which would have air space between the outer wall and the inner wall and would come with a vacuum seal and would actually keep the contents warm for a reasonable amount of time, which this unit does not do. If you plan on using it to make a pot of coffee for several people and don't plan on topping off the cups later, then this is a good product. But don't plan on coming back for refills and expect the coffee to be hot. UPDATE: 3 years later ... still using this and still finding it a superior product. While it lacks true thermal capability, it delivers a great cup of coffee and lasts through the years."
5,I love this coffee,I purchased this french coffee press for my daughter for christmas. we both love it. the coffee tastes sooooo yummy. I buy good quality coffee and follow the instuctions and you cant go wrong..the only complaint someone may make is that the coffee is not really hot..doesnt bother me. i like it just the way it comes out and im sold. im buying another one for my mom. she drinks instant coffee and is in for a big surprise when she trys this out...this is what coffee should taste like...yummy yummy
4,Behind the Veil,My mentor forced me to listen to this song (behind the veil #5) and i thank GOD she did... i was just taken over by the presence of God as i listened to this song... i felt like i was in the room while she was ministering and i felt like she was talking to me and i found it to be a blessing and i am about to go to the store and buy the CD! cause i am excited about the LORD! Hallelujah....!!!!!!!********~~~~~~~~
1,Not happy at all,"When I finally received my CD, the case was completely broken. The case fell apart after I removed the plastic wrap. Not impressed whatsoever..."
5,A Timeless Classic,A classic that will never grow thin. Suitable for anyone of any age. If only families were still as close and life were still so simple.
1,It was a gift. But the case was broken.,The box was shipped and the pieces were inside the video box. I was really disappointed because this was suppose to be a thoughtful gift.
4,A touch of nostalgia,"This is one show that I have many pleasant memories of. As a teen, my family would gather around the tv on Thursday evenings to watch the day to day adventures of the Walton clan. It touched my father because he was from the mountainous area of eastern Kentucky and he was born in 1932. The whole show was almost like going home each week for him. I felt our family got to know a little more about what his childhood was like by watching this show.My parents were down this weekend and I rec'd the first season, so just like we did 30 some odd years ago, we gathered around the tv and enjoyed the first three episodes. I was tickled to see how good the picture was and was also impressed with the audio. This set has brought back so many pleasant memories of gathering around the tv mirroring the Waltons gathered around the radio.I am so glad Warner's has provided us with this fine family show on dvd. Now if they can just find some extra's for the next set."
5,These People Should be a Protected National Treasure,"The people we encounter along our video journey should be declared a national historic treasure. You will see common folks from all walks of life who's address is still along the Mother Road. I really enjoyed the segment on the Wigwam Motel and the Stripper Museum. It is bittersweet to think that they are the last of the breed. I was also pleased to see that slim, trim Martin Milner's waistline has enlarged a little more that mine..."
4,"Danielle, New York City","This was the first romance story I ever read and it took me standing online in the supermarket a few weeks ago to realize that. Amazingly I really like J.D. Robb's IN DEATH series more so then the books under her real name of Nora Roberts. With the expections of Hidden Riches and Homeport, which I couldn't put down until the end."
2,Horrible Smell,"We opened the box to this crib and immediately closed it. The smell coming from the pieces was horrible! It smelled of moth balls and wood glue (I think). I could not bear the smell to even put it together, let alone ever put it in my daughter's bedroom, so I put it in my basement hoping it would outgas and try again in a week.Waiting for an e-mail back from Badger Customer Service on what the materials of the crib are. Did anyone else have the same problem?"
1,Poorly constructed toy!,The toy would not fit together as constructed & I had to fix and create at least 5 holes so the toy would fit together. 1 part is noticeably cracked & another broke as I was screwing it in as it was so fragile. I have pictures. I am not a happy buyer! My advice: buy the kidcraft cradle.
1,Crap!,"When we took this out of the box the screws don't even hold because they were stripped right out of the box. Also, once assembled it lasted about 10 minutes before it was broken! A sad way to waste $40."
1,This was Horrid!,"Philips has A LOT to learn about customer service. After purchase and numerous phone calls I found that PIP does NOT work w/ satalite, no one at Philips understands the M-link and the TV died within a month. I mean no picture, no sound no anything.After repair (where TV was gone 3 weeks) it was OK for a month, then the sound kept fading in and out, the sound equalizer did not function and I started to get feed back from the DVD.Philips answer ""not our pronblem"" in not so nice words. They felt it was Azons problem. I read them my warranty info, they said ""nope"" and hung up.I will NEVER buy another Philips product again.On the other hand Amazon has been absolutely wonderful and helpful. LOVE Amazon!"
2,On the record - Not too factual,"It didn't seem that Dan reviewed this book before it was printed. One part of the book, Dan says he threw the trick play against the NY Jets to Fryar. That was wrong, it was Ingram. The next error is that he was making NY think he was going to throw it into the dirt. There is no dirt in NY, it is all Turf. Last, he said that the noice is so loud with all the NY Fans in the stadium. Everyone in NY knows that that stadium is 1/3 Dolphins Fans when Miami comes into town."
3,Not for the 3-5 set,"The story begins at a train station in New York city. A teacher and her class are going on a field trip to Utah. As they travel further and further from New York, they look out the window and see earlier and earlier periods of time. In Philadelphia, they see horse-drawn carriages and women in long skirts. In Pittsburgh Civil War Union soldiers board the train. By the time they reach Utah, they are in prehistoric times.I checked this book out of the library after hearing about it on Reading Rainbow. After reading it to my 3 and 5 year olds, I realize that this was really not for their age-group. Too many conclusions must be drawn by looking at the pictures. It left them thinking, ""I don't get it."" Maybe I'll try again when they're older."
1,Broke easily,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas and it broke just 2 1/2 months later. He didn't use it as a hammer either, just normal wear and tear. The inner plastic part that holds the blade broke. Worked well while it lasted though."
4,I still love this album!,"Heather Headley's big hit from this album was I Wish I Wasn't, but the rest of the album is just as dynamite. I love the several funky numbers such as He Is! The ballads are fabulous! I love that one song where she tells this young girl to get her act together. Few Broadway singers can step off that stage and make a phenomenal album like Heather did. She gives some R&B female artists Faith Evans, Monica, Alicia Keys, and some others a run for their money here! Such fabulous vocals on every song! She even has a song now on the Diary of A Mad Black Woman soundtrack, so she's not finished yet. Hope that Heather makes some more exciting and soulful albums such as this!"
3,fine,"I love Heather Headley's voice. That said, this is a generic R&B CD, with only a few standout tracks."
3,Not bad but?,"The first couple of songs by my home girl ate very good the rest were ok but not as good. However, Iwill buy again because I know that she will do better in time"
2,"""He Is"" - Very hot song....otherwise than that...""","Okay I really enjoyed Heather Headley's single He Is, and that is pretty much it. I must give this artist credit, the woman can ""Sang"" but the production is nothing special and none of her songs have any caughty elements. It's only twelve tracks on it and half of them are on the morbid overdramtic side. In all fairness if you like this style of music you may find this disc to be appealing. Bottom line it's just not making it for me."
1,Friends and family?,I bought this CD because of the wonderful rewievs. They must be written by friends and family. The CD was simply dull and boring. There are one million CDs out there sounding exactly like this.What a waste! Don't buy it!
5,Must Have CD!,"Once I could get past the first song (which is why I bought the CD), I realized that I could actually enjoy the entire CD. All of the songs are well written and her voice is beautiful. If you enjoy R&B, this is a CD you will not want to be without."
2,I Like Women...,"...Who write their own music and lyrics. This CD is okay, doesn't really make me cringe or anything, but I don't listen to it. The songs aren't that great, and the woman doesn't sing with much emotion or soul - prolly cause she didn't write the stuff and don't really feel it. That's my take anyway. Nothing special here other than a superficially sweet voice.If you want to listen to a soulful female that writes her own stuff - don't buy this cd."
2,Her album is all singles,"I wish I wasn't is her only good song on this album. He is isn't even that good of a song. It's okay. The rest of the album sucks. This is an example of an album where an artist puts out a good single knowing they could suck you into it.I wouldn't reccommend this album to anyone, unless they just want it for the singles. And for that, you could download the songs for 99 cents ea. on the internet.Overall, it's a bad album.There's nothing more to really say about it."
1,Battery Power,If you use these in Surefire Flashlights be aware that they have a very poor lifespan even with little use and probably pertains to all brands of 3v lithium products. If the voltage falls to less than 6v total in these flashlights as tested by a volt meter the flashlight will fail completely.
5,Naked Into The Wilderness,"Though a little can be said with many words, a few can say much... very good book. A couple of the pictures (traps) are a little difficult, as well as with the basketry pictures. Other than that... solid."
5,This book is awesome!!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said, this is the first by John McPherson that I have purchased. It just arrived yesterday and I haven't been able to put it down. This book teachs all the things I wanted to learn from my grandmother and family and was never shown. The moment I opened it and saw how to make my own bow I was hooked. This book has everything I have been looking for. This book is awesome!! This book is worth much more than I paid for it, if you want to escape totally, or have to survive without much or any aid from the modern world...this is a must have and must know book."
4,"Good book, crummy pictures.",The book itself is great but the grainy black and white photographs are next to usless. Some crisp colored pictures might increase the cost but their value would more than compensate for a modest price increase.A picture is still worth a thousand words.
5,This is the book for learning primative skills,"lots of 'survival' books around and many more 'bushcraft' books. They promise an infinate amount of information but ultimately fail to do anything original. This book is written in the first person. It doesnt rely on a theory published by somebody else. It is a detailed explaination of many things ranging from Primative shelters to primative projectile weapons to primative trapping systems, to processing and preserving wild game, to making cordage and primative fire. Each section is illustrated with actual photographs of the author accomplishing the subject matter himself / herself and not some drawing that was lifted out of another previous publication. Very few original works in this subject area. This is the exception"
4,Simple and sweet,"This book presents the four questions in a brief, simple style that is easy for young children to understand. When I first bought this book, I wasn't sure if my son would like it, but he wants it read again and again. The illustrations are detailed and very colorful; he loves them. This is a good introduction or reintroduction to the basic concepts of the four questions for any child."
5,Lani Hall and the other vocalists,"I just purchased ""The Very Best of Sergio Mendez and Brasil 66"". Fabulous! I have forgotten some of the lyrics (in Portuguese too - although I am not Portuguese) They gave me a yearning to want to learn the language. Anyway, I absolutely love Lani Hall but I don't think the other gal(s) have ever gotten credit at all for the marvelous harmony they created. I think the vocalist on Brazill 66 was Janice _________? I know Karen Philipp replaced her when they recorded ""Fool on the Hill"". Would love any info on this. Thanks!"
1,Encoded as region 2!,"The product ID matches the version of the disc sold on the Amazon UK site. It is NOT region free. It is encoded as Region 2, meaning that it will NOT play back on any Blu-Ray player in Canada or the U.S. That includes PlayStation 3 and any computer. I made the mistake of ordering it. Be warned!"
2,"In blue ray version, my blu ray player can`t read the disk. (spanish too)","In blue ray version, my blu ray player can't read the disk. instead I should to buy the DVD version.Inicialmente compre la versión en blu ray, pero mi reproductor de blu ray no la pudo leer, por ser europea, por lo tanto tuve que comprar el DVD."
4,Good Movie,"This is a very clever, enjoyable movie. Pierce Brosnan is good, as usual. It is a well done who-dun-it. I will watch it over and over."
3,A reasonable movie..,It isn't Pierce Brosnan's best movie but it gets the job done. It has a good plot and gives a decent twist at the end that leaves you satisfied that the good guys still win!
2,one-dimensional music from a multi-dimensional composer,"After hearing so many other wonderful solo works by Sciarrino for strings and flute, the piano pieces are for me a disappointment. The kind of timbral subtlety that you get in that music is absent here.There is an excitement to some of the sonatas with their tangles and swirls of notes. There is a nice, atmospheric feel to ""Perduto in una città d'Acque"" and ""Anamorfosi"" is practically quaint. Lacking is the risky sense of adventure and tension which informs so much of Sciarrino's other work. I just don't think the man has much to say with the piano.I suppose the composer likes the way that Damerini plays, since he has written a number of these pieces for the pianist. I find his tone strident and lacking depth. He can sound plenty loud and fast but so can a jackhammer.If you are interested in Sciarrino, I'd say look elsewhere first."
3,"Bonus Chapter good, the rest is filler","I wanted to get an overview of classic, popular landmarks on Route 66. The Bonus Chapter does that. But the main program just seems to go on and on with interviews with various people, and what they think of the old highway."
3,Old but good,"I'm planning a Route 66 photo trip and this kind of DVD was useful to have a brief look on the road and its history. On the other hand it is quite old and needs an update. Nevertheless, I recommend!"
5,EMPOWERING AND INSIGHTFUL,"I found this book filled with common sense and insight. Written in terms the common man can understand, even if you are not politicly savvy . It resonated with me. I found myself nodding yes, smiling, cheering. It's a feel good book on politics. If I must qualify this book in human terms I would say ""sincere"". I truly enjoyed it! It' a quick read, can't put it down. What an exciting experience!"
4,A great deal if you use them,"These books were a great deal as it would have cost me more (at the time) to buy them separately as opposed to together. I used them a lot in preparing my first year and still use some of them (since some subjects carry over, i.e. Con Law). If you are going to use the books, if you actually are going to study from them and supplement your notes and/or outlines with them, these books are a great source of blackletter law in an understandable format. But, since there's so much information in each book that you probably won't use in your particular class's version of [insert law subject here] it's a waste of your money if you just let them sit around without use.For more information on these, check out the Gilbert Law Summaries homepage. I also recommend the ""Understanding"" series of books by Lexis."
1,"Annoying to me, but most importantly baby is not interested","I have 2 Baby Einstein DVDs and read reviews that this video was better. I wish I had purchased another Einstein product instead. This sounds like a great idea and the puppet is cute. My son gets excited when the puppets show up on the Einstein DVDs, so I thought he would love this. This puppet is annoying and makes strange noises. I guess it is supposed to be ""baby-like"" noises, but they are just weird. The young girl that plays with the puppet is not enjoyable to watch. The ideas of how to play with your baby are just common sense things you are probably doing anyway. This doesn't affect how my baby likes the video, but I am also surprised to see earrings and necklaces on the young babies. Why?"
1,ouch,not a fan! Got these shoes and couldn't wear them! The soles are very hard and the straps are rough. that combo made it impossible to walk around in comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this at all!
3,Cheap Zombie Schlock Cinema,"Its 1979 so won't you come on down to the Don Dohler school for independent shoe string budgeted schlock found here in Baltimore, Maryland! All I can attest to is that there might not be great effects or a real good storyline to this turkey but I enjoyed it. I killed some time and sat down to view this gem and was quite surprised despite its rep that its not that horribly unentertaining. I had a laugh and viewed it for its worth. You have to respect that these people had a blast making this film. Don was recooping from a jilted SNAFU on the ""Nightbeast"" film he would later complete around 1982 and some money was leftover. I personaly enjoyed 1978's ""Alien Factor"" which he made with almost the same cast better.Cheers"
1,Error laden book of psycho-babble,This book was a major dissapointment. It is filled with historical and factual errors. Worse it offer nothing of substance to the average woman to use in her career. Don't waste your money.
1,Doesn't compare to the real thing,"Do not bother with this disjointed, disappointing attempt to tell women how to get ahead. Rubin's treatise is poorly constructed and difficult to follow. She fails to appreciate the most important lesson in Machiavelli's The Prince: that you must be willing to do whatever is necessary to get ahead. She instead insists that women are incapable of that kind of ruthlessness, and advises that we take everything on the chin and hope we can turn a string of failures into success. No thanks. I'll just stick with the original."
2,Beginners only,"A mostly accurate text book style account of the history and behind the scenes action of ECW. A decent book for anyone that knows only a small part of the ECW story. I was put off by the randomly placed editorial opions thrown into what is basically written as a somewhat factual timeline of ECW. Calling the company's Canadian showing as it's first ""over-seas"" appearance was an in-excusable oversite, (unless you consider the great lakes a ""sea""). I found the book to be often quite dry reading and found myself nodding off with my kindle on my chest.If you are a new hardcore Pro Wrestling fan with very little previous knowledge of ECW, it may be worth a read, but beyond that I can't recommend the book."
1,Really sad,"Ok now that the band and their friends gave it all 5 stars I think people outside of that realm should be able to voice their opinion. Look how the few unfortunate stores that do have it are selling it on here for lower and lower amounts. You'll be able to find it for [practically nothing] soon enough. They just want that 2 inches of shelf space back!Now to my feelings of the record it is obviously a bad rip off of Radiohead. You can listen to the soundbytes on their website and there is nothing even slightly memorable about any of the tracks. The singer sounds like he's doing his best to imitate Thom Yorke but can't pull it off. Bottom line is it's NOT original, NOT interesting, and NOT worth mentioning at all. This band will be struggling for a LONG LONG time. I hope they have fun playing to empty clubs on Monday nights for the next 10 years."
5,Smokey and the Bandit II,Bought this for my grandkids and they watch it all the time between this and the Dukes can't ask for much more
2,West Bound and WAY Down,"Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham should have ended their stunt-filled collaboration after ""Hooper."" Instead, they churned out ""Smokey and the Bandit II"" (1980) - a mostly joyless sequel to the high-spirited original. The welcome return of Jackie Gleason, Sally Field and Jerry Reed is negated by Burt's sour attitude toward the whole enterprise. Needham stages a lavish demolition-derby climax, but only Gleason appears to be having fun."
1,Save your bucks and just watch part one again...,"Same cast, crew and director - how could they screw up a simple car chase movie. They even had Gleason back!! Total dud. Nothing even slightly amusing whatsoever here. Not even the bloopers at the end were funny. Not even Jackie Gleason could help this turkey. No wonder Burt didn't come back for #3. Save your bucks. I'd hate to see the video collections of those who rated this 5 stars....."
3,passport to paradise,usually anything just including racquel is awesome but this one was a disappointment
3,Good for small cameras,Good for small cameras like Powershots. Not good for EOS cameras. A stronger camera base would be useful and appreciated.
2,Kite Line Winder,"Descent quality line, However the winder is basically useless. It will take a long time to wind in a kite with this type of reel. I bought it and transferred the line to a hoop style winder. Buy it for the line not the winder."
3,advertising,"The way the item is pictured led me to believe I was ordering four spools, but it was just to display the colors. So you can imagine my disappointment when I received only one. I recommend having a color scheme to the side instead of displaying four spools. Thanks!"
5,Great T.V.!,"I purchased this t.v. last week and couldn't be happier. The picture and sound quality is terrific. The flat screen allows you to see the picture just as clearly from any angle. I also love the picture in picture feature, which is much easier to use than the older versions you had to run through a VCR. When I bought the t.v., I didn't think I would use the PIP, but now that I have it, it is on constantly! Also, it has a game hook up in the front of the t.v. for easy plug-in, plug-out; very convenient if you don't have room to keep your game system hooked up all the time. I know there are flat screen brands available for less, but this t.v. has the 3-D digital comb filter...definitely top of the line without spending a thousand dollars!"
1,Compatability issues with Netgear products,This card can create a link to my Netgear wireless routers (WNR3500 or DG834PN) but can't make an internet connection (DHCP problem?). Works fine with an older USR 8054 wireless router.Get better wireless range with the USR 8054 than either of the Netgear RangeMax routers even when used with matching Netgear RangeMax adapters.
5,"Excellent CD, can't wait to hear more","I was pleasantly surprised when I gave this CD a shot and found it to be a big hit for me. There isn't a song on here that I don't enjoy, which is a genuine accomplishment! The sound is catchy, the lyrics are interesting and the vocals are great as well. This has easily been the CD I've listened to the most in the last year and look forward to future efforts from Everyday Sunday.(...)"
1,Music is going down the drain,"Music has been going downhill for a long time now, and everyday sunday is driving the car down the hill. Terrible record, perfect for 8 years old."
2,It was okay....,"A tribute to the influence of Marion Zimmer Bradley, Return to Avalon is a collection of short stories devoted to the fantasy genre. Authors include Melanie Rawn, Diana L. Paxton, Laura Resnick, Dave Wolverton, Katharine Kerr, Adrienne Martine-Barnes and others. I mostly enjoyed the book, but felt the publicity was misleading. It was not any sort of continuation of MZB's Avalon stories, nor were most of them connected to Avalon's legend in any way. The main focus in each story was finding strength within, communicating with the Goddess, and early Christians confronting the Old Religion. I feel that some of the authors did not have signficant talent relaying their creative ideas on paper."

1,Van Praagh or Dr. Feelgood?,I found this book's content to be overly simplistic. Van Praagh disappoints me with this Dr. Feelgood approach to spiritual growth. Clearly this book is straight out of Hollywood.
3,Interesting to say the least!,"James Van Praagh's book - Reaching to Heaven - seems to contain details about the after-life that in my opinion provides far too much information. It is as though Van Praagh has had a holiday in the spirit world for a couple of months and come back to report to us what it is like up there? Although in places I found I did not want to put the book down, I did wonder if his editors had perhaps stretched Van Praagh's ideas of what he thinks it is really like in heaven.I recently read John Edward's book - One Last Time - and Jenny Crawford's book - Through the Eyes of Spirit, I give both these books five stars."
4,Voodoo spell,"The reviewers who refer to the surreal poetry of this movie are (forgive me) dead on. This movie is creepy. It's not scary, but it captures the essense of Caribbean creepiness well. You can almost smell the decay of the rotting vegetation and flesh.Lugosi plays the villain well and gives a performance that makes necromancy seem believable (coffee works a similar magic for me in the mornings. Come to think of it, the zombies' undead shuffle is strangely familiar as well.) This movie is not for the average film viewer, but should be in every horror fans collection for its own merits and for its historic perspective as the first zombie movie."
3,"frighteningly fresh and original, when sound cinema was new","This film is a great pleasure, from the time when hollywood wasn't turning out cookie-cutter potboilers but still inventing the form. The atmosphere is extremely creepy and believable. In old Haiti, where there are legends of zombies, a beautiful young fiancee has arrived to marry the man she loves. Things go awry, as men who understand how to use the ancient magic or whatever it is attempt to use it for their own designs. The girl apparently disappears in death, but then the instrument of terror - the incomparable, Bela Lugosi in his prime - turns the tables on his old boss; his stare in already unforgettable. The adventure that follows is very fun, if a bit clunky. This is almost a classic and worth seeing.REcommended."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This copy did not contain ""Making of.."" which does exist on the local library's copy. Nowhere in the description is it stated that the short making of film is not included.Very disappointing."
1,We gave up after 40 minutes - too boring.,"My wife and I see a fair number of French films, but after 40 minutes, we found it too uninteresting to spend any more time with. Luckily, we saw it on TV, so I don't have the DVD of it."
2,Kind of a lot for a brochure,"Thirty-two pages? Unless you're desperate for this information--and I don't see why anyone would be; there's lots of FLW books--be aware that you're only getting about a dozen color pics and a brief accompanying story. Usonian houses are thoroughly covered in John Sergeant's book, in a more scholarly way. Nice presentation though: the cover is perforated like the plywood panels on the house."
5,Best Ever! But it cost too much for shipping...,"I love LOVE my ecloths. It's true, they are like magic. I am in awe how well they clean with just water. Love it!!! I have found that [...] usually has better prices, a great selection and FREE shipping..."
3,A little too mature for young audiences,"This book is really too mature for young kids. I gave it to my 5 year old niece for her birthday, and while I was reading it I regretted giving it to her because I had to change some of the phrases (as I was reading) to make them more kid-friendly. If my sister ever reads it aloud to her young daughter, she'll probably be miffed with me for giving it as a gift."
3,Overall nice but Software needs some reworking for bugs.,"After reading several reviews of the Euro version, I decided to purchase the US version when it came out. Compared it against the similar featured: Garmin Quest (smaller screen), Magellan Roadmate 300 (no battery), and the Tom Tom Go (more expensive). Have found the satellite acquistion is excellent and the displayed map good. Mine has a minor hardware glitch in that the volume wheel does not work. My major complaint is the software (SmartST Version 3.0) which I consider full of bugs. Often the voice prompts & map visual directions are at odds with each other; attempting to program off a City's Zone (must be the Euro Zip code?) is worthless & confusing so should be deleted from US edition software; unit periodically just freezes & locks up which requires a reboot to clear. Otherwise, once Navman fixes the software this will be a sweet little unit."
2,feature's a mess -the short is great,"I watched the short film that was part of the extras on this disc and was very entertained. It was smart, to-the-point & had a sort of retro black & white foreign film feel while retaining the existential twist that makes it interesting.Unfortunately,( don't get me wrong, I love many of Alex Cox's films )the feature was over-written, badly cast & had some of the worst recorded dialogue sound I've ever heard for a film.I wish that someone would release Cox's 'Highway Patrolman' on dvd as this one seems like a wasted effort."
4,Great for a beer lover,"Bought this for my son, who does home brewing, and he is enjoying it. It is helping him think about new beer recipes."
1,Sadly one sided and snooty,"As the title states, this book is sadly one sided and kowtows so much to European beers. It makes me sad this guy even brews beer in the United States.He gives no homage or respect to American beers, American foods, American lifestyle.In fact, it seems he bashes more of the American brands then has any respect for them. After reading through the whole book I am considering getting a refund.I bought this book to research food pairing with craft beers and all I get are how to pair European dishes with European beers. This book was a waste of time when trying to research how to pair every day foods with CRAFT beer.I will not recommend this book to anyone as there are MANY better books and better writers."
1,TOO STICKY AND GOOEY,"This wax was super sticky, very gooey, and did NOT wash off my skin afterward. I will never use this product again. Way too sticky. The GiGi waxes where you must keep them in a warmer are much better quality than these microwavable waxes."
1,Not EVEN decently written fluff!,"I purchased this book (used) at the same time I purchased the first book in the series, Burning Water, by the same author. I'm pasting my review for the first book here because they are interchangeable tripe.I'm ashamed to have this book in my possession and will burn it today!This author writing about the occult is about like a devout Catholic writing about Atheism - no comprehension at all. (By the way - I'm neither.)I agree with my fellow reviewers from whom I've quoted:""...so annoying, I wanted to reach in the book and slap her...""""... dialogue is so bad (inane), I actually started highlighting certain bits to relate to my friends...""""...almost hear the cheese music as the 'action' unfolds...""""...one of the most poorly written books I have ever encountered.""If you're in the mood to make fun of someone's writing, this is the book for you.Otherwise, STAY AWAY! (Well, you might like it if you're not over twelve.)"
4,"Fabulous Movie, Great Theme Song!","This film is very erotic and very sensual, with great acting by Steven Bauer. I also love the theme song by Melissa Manchester."
4,The grass is not always greener & better on the other side.,"Enjoyed this movie when I was younger, couldn't believe it was available here. It is dated by the period, but still enjoyed."
3,Does the job,"These feel a bit flimsy and light, but I installed them before hurricane Irene hit came through a few months ago, and they did the job of channeling water away from the house. I like that they can be extended, although the way they connect to each other doesn't seem like it will stand up to a lot of wear and tear. They would be better if they came with a few extra screws for attachment, and for the material I don't think they are worth the price. However, nothing else of similar design seems available."
2,Very Limited,My son (12 yrs) received this for Xmas last year and has not taken it out of the closet since January. He played with it for a month straight learning the capabilities of the robot (he never touched the mini robot) but lost interest in it once he figured out it couldn't do anything else without spending more money on it!
5,Dylan's Top Five,"Infidels is the closest thing to straight ahead rock Dylan has ever done: This makes it more accessable to the casual listener, but seems to alienate some die hard fans. Along with Highway 61 Revisited, Desire, Blood On The Tracks and Oh Mercy it represents the greatest ""Rock"" Dylan has produced."
5,Beautiful Book,"This is an book without the theory of evolution being woven in as fact. It's thorough, colorful, and it includes a tiny bit of biblical history. All aspects of a thorough geology study are covered. This book is perfect for someone with a Creationist worldview. This is one of the best purchases I've ever made for our homeschooling."
1,Creationism books!,"This is a creationism book disguised as a science book for kids. Pretty sleazy and dishonest. I am a scientist by training, and was not pleased when I received them. I immediately sent them back!"
1,Geology for First Graders,The illustrations in the book are well done. It ought to sell well to Fundamentalist Christian Bible study classes. Obviously it belongs in the Religion section rather than in Science. No one with a mind capable of assimilating science will be diverted from that profession by reading this book.
2,Very Limited Book,"This book has very few examples and the exercies are do notfollow the logic of the lessons. Very hard to read and understand, simple concepts are made very difficult through this book. Assumes a lot from the reader. (i.e. ""Obviously, the answer is 2""). Obviously? It took me two hours to come up with that answer! Show me HOW!Seems like this book was written for those who know combinatorics already, not good for beginners."
2,A talented but flawed life,"The author was one of my boyhood icons. In this autobiography she undermines my high opinion with unwitting revelations of her unending self regard, and her obsessive craving for celebrity and adulation.She fails her children, paricularly Larry, in this frantic search for theatrical success. Yes, she was a talented lady, but she bought success at a terrible price to those around her. I stand disappointed."
5,Hot Date Rocks!!!!!!!!!,Hot Date is the expasion pack to get on may 31st all ya sim lovers on macs should get it you have like 100 new things to do with other sims like different kisses and hugs you go downtown shop eat and you build your own resteraunt with unlimited simoleons its real fun you have some new items and build stuff too.This would have to be my favorite expansion pack.!?
2,"Not exactly a page-turner, but interesting","Until Gillian Bagwell's novel, The Darling Strumpet, hits the shelves on January 4, 2011, this has been my Nell Gwyn read. Paints a picture of Restoration London and compares Gwyn to the other mistresses of King Charles II.Some interesting little quotes and tidbits from personal correspondence and diaries, but doesn't read like a novel. Interesting factoids about Nell's jewelry, furniture, etc.Yeah, right. A bit dry."
1,What a Joke,"This is the absolute worst book I've ever read. Not just the worst Civil War book, the worst book, period. The author devotes 11 measley pages to the actual engagement referred to in the title. The editing is so sloppy, every few pages are typos. The maps offered in the book are useless. No orientations to North, no scales, lacking in all detail. The most upsetting thing is the lack of documentation. It was almost as if this guy saw the movie and used that as the outline of his book. He offered very little in the way of proof to any of his assertations. The worst thing is, this guy was an officer in the Army. As an officer myself, I'm extremely disappointed in my peer. Do not waste your time with this book."
2,The Plumbed Knight,"The Plumbed Knight. Yes, you read it correctly! Although I am certain that COL Walker wrote ""plumed"", the editor hired by the publisher was apparently not familiar with the subject (How can an editor not be familiar with the subject? This is the publishing business, isn't it?) and therefore changed ""plumed"" to ""plumbed"". Twice. Or perhaps the word processing software did it, and nobody caught it. Disappointing."
4,Good Garbage,"We first heard this tape when we borrowed it from the library and it was a must have. My two year old goes crazy over the good garbage song - something I am also very excited about. While I know she is just thrilled with the tune and the funny motions I make to it now, I know it is helping her to learn and opening up opportunities for us to talk about recycling. Out of all her ""kid"" albums, this one is also the easiest on MY ears!"
3,Did My Research,"After doing a bit of research on my own, I decided to go ahead with the tried and true alcohol based products. Apparently, Benzalkonium Chloride is toxic in certain forms. One website even stated that it can cause birth defects! I can't tell you for sure that this product isn't safe or isn't any good, but I know that it's not worth the risk. After all the recalls lately, I've certainly learned that things aren't safe just because they are touted to be."
2,An amazing tale that got lost in translation.,"I met Amy at BEA where I got a signed copy of her book. She was sincerely nice, and I was honored to meet this person who survived such an unbelievable ordeal. However, when I read the book, I felt disappointed (as an editor) by the writing and lack of editing. A powerful story that could have become a huge success as a book was instead relegated to mediocrity due to no editorial direction. I had seen so many reviews of the book prior to BEA; if only the publisher had put as much effort into the book itself as it did into the marketing plan. If you are a quick reader and a backpacker, I still recommend reading the book for the power of Amy's experience. The story gets lost in the middle, however, and the details of her recovery in the hospital are too, too much, while the details of her private life get glossed over and leave the reader confused."
2,Exaggerated title,"The book analyses the subjects at an amateur level and it is lacking in content. As a necessity of my doctoral dissertation I bought it and regret.The letter fonts are unnecessarily too big; according to me the real volume should be about 175 pages.Photographs and drawings(plan, etc.)are inadequate and print quality is not good.I was expecting a satisfying book."
5,Awesome!,Bought these (and glow bracelets) for my party. Everyone loved them and I had no dead sticks in my pack.
4,Miami Vice,"I just got done with watching Miami Vice and it took me back to the '80's again, when everything was all good. ""The Decade Of Excess"", or as it is now so known so affectionately, brought back the old memories. Cool cars (Ferraris) and even cooler clothes then ( hot pink blazers) were of the day. Miami is a much different city now than it shows on here, but if you want to know what Vice was all about, this is the video to get!"
5,Great Techniques & Inspiration!,"Not only is this an incredibly interesting history of Latvian mittens, it gives you all the information you need to make up your own or use one of the complete patterns. The differing color combos are inspiring--if you have any interest in these, this book is a great value!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I wanted to purchase this book for my husband's birthday. I went looking for it at a local bookstore after discovering it here on amazon and reading the great reviews - we are both lovers of Tollkien's works. My first reaction was - 'gee, its tiny' - being only slightly bigger than a pocket size book. Then I looked more closely. A hardcover, yes, but nothing spectacular in quality. The pictures are sweet, light and airy, but I expected more. And as for the verse - I also expected there to be more. It is well written, but very brief. Four brief lines of verse on each right-hand page, while the page on the left was an illustration. I didn't stand there and count lines of text, but since there are maybe 24 pages in the book total, that would make it 12 pages of text or 48 short lines of verse in the whole book. It could have been printed on one or two pages and still been surrounded by lovely illustrations.It's just not worth the money in my book - no pun intended."
3,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed. It was a very short book with little text but some nice pictures. My grandson wasn't that interested.
2,Eeeeehhhhh.,"Hey, I really like Mogwai and have been into them for several years since the ""Ten Rapid"" collection came out. One of the better bands operating today in a massive sea of garbage bands that have no reason to exist other than to release a single that sounds like a zillion other bands, make some quick cash and then (thankfully) drift back into the oblivian of working as telemarketers and burgerflippers. Mogwai generally rise above the pack.My Father My King is good. It really is. But I've heard these boys take more extended emotional and sonic journeys in a much briefer space with more musical variation going on to boot.Well, no one bats 1000."
2,"Audio only as PCM, not as described by Amazon","While a Blu-ray content provider is free to choose the audio codec/s for their own disc, I found the lack of legacy Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 a negative considering that the only way surround PCM can be received by an A/V receiver or pre/pro is via HDMI, a feature not present in millions of legacy A/V receivers that still use optical/coax digital inputs for legacy DD and DTS lossy codecs.Additionally, the only way one could find this out is by actually ordering the disc, because Amazon product specification is misleading and incorrect, which is a common problem in Amazon.Regarding the content itself, I concur with the statements others have made about Maria being overweight, boringly walking slowly around the stage for the entire show, and the songs not as melodic and nice as they use to be.The price for a Blu-ray title at 1080i was reasonable when originally released compared to a two-channel CD, and we hope that prices would still come down."
2,EXPECTED BETTER THAN THIS FROM MARIAH !!,"I went to the Adventures of Mimi Tour in NYC @ Madsion square garden. I have always been a huge mariah fan since i was little so this was big for me. This was the 1st time I would be seeing her live and lets just say....i expected more. 1st off she came out an hour late. the opening act started at 7:00. Mariah wasnt out till like 9:30 !! THATS TOO LONG. LONGEST IVE EVER WAITED FOR A MAIN ACT AT A CONCERT. she did all the hits , but never danced once. just stood there stiff. lol. then she mad a big issue about the lighting and stoped in the middle of "" Fly like a bird "" and bitched and complained like the diva that she is. I love mariah to death but i dont know i just wanted it to more entertaining , more lively. I was bored to death. I feel like I wasted my money on my ticket and why the hell would i buy this dvd. in other words if you didnt go, you didnt miss much of anything. Her tour was not worth it !!"
3,a bit shocked,"I got this DVD a week ago. Honestly, her singing is quite acceptable, though not at her prime. But what shocked me is, like some of the reviewers have mentioned, she really turned herself into a soprano diva of classical music, physically I mean. She was too huge, compared to all the others on stage. She should pay attention to that. Afterall, she is a performer and quite a good-looking one. She shouldn't allow that to happen."
4,Fabulous Fungi!!!,"Great movie! Lighthearted, informative, and nostalgic. Ron Mann does a great job of bringing mushrooms to life with animation and old film clips while tripping along with real life fungophiles Gary Lincoff and Larry Evans. Fun movie for everyone!"
3,Poor Fit and Finish,"These pieces are solid and should hold up well. However, the fit and finish is fairly poor which is really not surprising in this price range. For example, their was a burr left on the spatula from the grinding process that I had to remove with a file. If you are willing to sacrifice fit and finish for a good price, these tools are an excellent value."
5,Very well built - Worth the money,"These storage containers are very nice. By far the nicest I have seen around. Wheels are great, lids great. Very nice. I highly recomend getting these if you are looking for nice storage."
5,Subtle. Powerful.,"Alex Kharlamov's ""Posa Somata, Posa Pneumata"" will, without doubt, appeal to many different pallets, as the musical, not to mention emotional, variety is exceeding. Subtle. Powerful. I believe that the linear nature of this album, the generous quasi sonata form as a whole, combined with skillfully crafted music will appeal to film music fans of the ""Braveheart"" and Schindler's List"" vein. The earthy, yet non-corporeal timbres will delight the ears of the Enya, Lisa Gerrald, Arvo Part and even the Aphex Twin lover. Furthermore, as the album touches on quartertone harmony along with several nods toward ancient music, the serious musician walks away fulfilled. However, it is the heart and essence that Mr. Kharlamov has poured into this musical telling that will grip you from the first few bars to the end. The production quality of this album is of the highest standards and the performances, inspired."
2,tv image,"I was disappointed that the DVD picture was a strip across the tv screen with large black margins top and bottom, and did not fill my big screen tv. I checked back on the original ad for the DVD and there was no indication that it was that type of DVD. I know there used to be two kinds of DVD's; I don't know if that is still the case."
4,Sioux Chief Mfg 660-h 3/4 hose Male & female connection Mini Rester,"Read a previous review about this mini-rester being used on LG front load whasher with a loud valve noise, I thought, I would give it a try on my new LG washer with a similar nosie problem. Installed it and it dose reduce the noise level of the water valve opening. So I also purchased one for the hot water side also. Just be aware that it is a noise reduction device and it is not 100% effective."
2,Not really working,"My washer repairman recommended this arrester. My plumber didn't think it would work. So far, it has reduced the noise by maybe 20 per cent. If you purchase this item, don't expect miracles, except maybe you'll feel better knowing you tried to fix the problem."
5,Works GREAT,works great .. eliminated the water hammer from my LG washer..buy 2 of them one for the cold and hot supply line. very simple Install.. Solid product wish i got it sooner.
1,Fraud,"The default listing, sold by 42nd Street photo and fulfilled by Amazon, surge protectors are not legitimate and not authorized by Monster. I just lost nearly $4000 from a surge in an electrical storm and after sending this to Monster they said it is not an authorized product or seller of theirs and therefore the warranty is invalid.Edit:11/24/12 per other comment requestLook in other buying options and find the one that is around $40-50 which is Sold by Amazon, if you are expecting Monster to honor their warranty.[Sold by: ""Insert seller name here"" and Fulfilled by: Amazon] voids the warranty and the extended protection that you are most likely purchasing this protector for, unless the seller is specifically listed on Monsters authorized seller list. Go here and select the product family line you are considering purchasing for the authorized list, [...]"
3,A little cheaper than you might expect,"I thought, since this is a well-known brand and has a list price of $119.99, that the device would be made of heavy duty, high quality materials. It works fine and seems reasonably designed, but it is quite light, which is good for portability except for the fact that you don't really need to move it around much, and ""feels cheap"". So I expected it to be made of heavier components. It feels like a $25 surge protector, not a $119.99 surge protector. However, I have not opened it up to see its innards, and they may be quite good...it hasn't failed yet. In the end all that matters is how it deals with a surge. I've used it for my home theater for 6 months so far."
3,MoH: Sounds Like,Really good. Kind of like Vault of Terror or something from The Twilight Zone. I wasn't a fan of the ringing and scratching noises.Didn't get a director card with this one.
4,Blueprint 2,"I think that the original Blueprint was much better than Part 2, but I still do like this one. I mean a double album by Jay-Z (one of the greatest ever) is a great idea. 90% of the songs are really hot and you can just about bump it all the way through. I think that this album can appeal to all groups of rap fans. For the true thugs, there are some tight street songs like ""Meet The Parents"". Or for the ladies there's ""03 Bonnie & Clyde"". Almost every hip-hop fan has got to love ""A Dream"". This song is a true story about a dream Jigga had. Biggie's verse in this song was originally on his classic track ""Juicy"".I perosnally feel that Disc 2 is much more gangsta (and better) then Disc 1. Also, Jay-Z reveals that MOP has been hired and joins Roc-A-Fella Records in their song ""U Don't Know Remix"". I believe that this version of the song is better than the original that appeared on The Blueprint. This is an album that will probably get 4-4.5 Mics from The Source, but I still reccomend it."
2,Shoeprint 2 ur A**,"This was a bad album. Typical Jigga filler we are all used to on ""Volume 2"" and ""3"". There are maybe three-four good songs, and they are all on the 2nd disc, the first one I can't even listen to. I was really upset when Jay bit 2pac from 'Me and My Girlfriend', and did such a bad job doing it. Hovi Baby is my fav joint on the disc. Real hiphop fans look elsewhere."
2,Jay aint got it no more.,"I'm sorry, but Jay is really runnin outta steam. He's been kissin' Pac...for years when he knows that Pac hated his guts. I've always found it ironic how Jay was pretty quiet until Pac was killed. Then all of a sudden he starts releasin album after album, year after year. This album is really nothin special. I really don't think callin' it ""The Blueprint 2"" was necessary. Just ""The Gift & The Curse"" woulda been fine. There's no doubt that Jay-Z is goin down in history as one of the best ever. But the higher you are the harder you fall. I think he's gonna hit the ground pretty hard."
2,Jay-z disappointed me,"I think that Jay-z is a talented rapper. He writes the hottest lyrics (most of the times) and his songs are hot as hell (most of the times)... unluckily, this album is FULL of fillers. Besides the singles, the rest is trash."
2,"Jay-Z, Please don't abuse your talent.",Jay-Z is busting out albums like Usher can bust out dance moves. But at least Usher is good at dancing and always has a new move everytime. Jay-Z is getting to repetitive and the whole albums formed around Bonnie & Clyde. Go check out his other albums before you decide to buy this one. He also doesn't have the emphasis and will to get through every song. Seems like this album is just an answer to God's Son by Nas.
3,Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse,"With it being his 7th album, it went to No. 1 on Billboard 200, sold 545,000 copies in its first week, and featured a bunch of helpers on its tracks. Producers include Kanye West (A Dream, Poppin' Tags, Some People Hate), Just Blaze (Hovi Baby, U Don't Know Remix, Meet The Parents, Some How Some Way, As One, Show You How, Bitches & Sisters), Charlemagne (Blueprint 2), and The Neptunes (N**** Please), so the beats are hot. The singles from it were '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Excuse Me Miss, and Hovi Baby. Professionals Allmusic, who gave it 3 out of 5 stars as well, The A.V. Club, Spin and RapReviews all gave it positive reviews."
3,blueprint2,blueprint2 jayz no album drop in stores sep 1 2008. the first song is the best one in the hole album it talk about being free to the world and always runing the lats one talks about hes mom and his brother he loves him and the best because i think hes alway going to be the best raping and noone can stop him hes like pretty old and he still raps jayz is my favite raper because he make words so good.
2,OH BOY,"aight i have this garbage that u call an album and what kind of idiot would say that Hova (Jay-Z) is better than Makaveli (2Pac)? have u lost your mind or are u just one of those people who don't know anything about hip-hop but try to act like u understand what u are listenin to tsk tsk tsk...whatever the case is you're dumb...this album has about 8-9 good songs (and thats including both cds) Excuse Me Miss,Hovi Baby,The Bounce,Fu*k All Nite,Guns & Roses,2 Many H*es and some other songs...and in case you were wondering why i didn't put down '03 Bonnie & Clyde i don't think i have 2 say why but the real hip-hop fans will know..."
4,"Dalton Higgins, I hope you don't get paid for reviewing products...","""Do you want in on hip-hop's dirty little secret? Well, not even rap's greatest icons have been able to pull of a memorable, fast-forward-free double disc--2Pac's All Eyez on Me and Wu-Tang Clan's Wu-Tang Forever included.""You just lost any credibility I may have had for you with that statement. Both those aforementioned albums are straight up classics. That's right. ""Fast-forward-free double discs.""Anyway, this album is pretty good. It isn't near Jay-Z's best work, but it is better than his post 2003 garbage, when started to half sing half rap his lyrics.We got all types of tracks on here, including tracks for the ladies (which Jay-Z can pull off well), cocky-style Jay-Z persona songs, a track with an innovative guest appearance, diss tracks, ""I've been there, done that"" type tracks and gangsta-style music.Standout tracks include Disc 1: 1,2,3,7,8,9 and 11. Disc 2: 1,2,3,4,5,7,11,12, and 133.6 out of 5 stars. Rounded up to a 4."
2,Should have been great.,The Blueprint was a great album and to follow that up is hard. Jay-Z rushed the Blueprint 2. The songs didn't seem as personal or creative. The duets are the only reason to buy the disc. The remixs arn't bad either. The 2 disc should've been a 1 disc. But for die hard fans the more material the better.
1,JAYZ u stink,"y did Dr. Dre even bother helpin u....geez....and get it thru ur fat monkey head, dat PAC HATES U, STOP JACKIN OF OFF HIM"
2,Well at least he tried,"I just coped the Blueprint 2 a couple of days ago thinking that this is defenitely gonna be an amazing double cd album like All Eyez on Me. Blueprint 1 was amazing no doubt but, Blueprint 2 is a waste of time. There's not enough Jay-z, a lot of the songs are featuring people and, Jay's raps are the same as ever. He must've had 1000 lines in which he used ""jigga"" to rhyme with. Disc 2 is better than Disc 1 but still its not worth the time or the money. If you really wanna get a Jay-Z album your best of with blueprint 1, reasonable doubt or vol.2"
2,dissapointed,"what happened to the days when i could pop in a jay-z cd (reasonable doubt, or in my lifetime vol. 1) and enjoy the entire cd? i have trouble getting through the first track on the blueprint 2. the whole album sounds like a sample from all different genres of music. what audience is he trying to appeal to? jay-z, go back to your old school beats and lyrics. instead of buying the blueprint 2, check out Tupac Better Dayz. that album is off the hook! better dayz is the first album i've thoroughly enjoyed in years."
3,Far from expectations,This Cd isn't horrible but it's not a good CD either. It has too many tracks that a person isn't able to listen to. Blueprint blows this album out of the water. There is no comparison. He just doesn't bear much on this album. Blueprint was a lot more creative while it seemed like he was a little slack on this album.
1,One word for this album.............(...).,"Jay-Z, where's the production at? The lyrics are typical of J., but the music production (...).. There are maybe 2-4 decent cuts on this album of 25 songs... It doesn't seem like Jay-Z put much time in the studio checking what beats his lyrics got laid down to. I will still buy future albums of his, but if the next one is anything like this.......the rest are getting downloaded...."
4,"not a classic, but still pretty good","A lot of people have been hatn' on Jigga cause they say the Blueprint 2 is wack. Even Jay himself attempted to fix the problem with the new blueprint 2.1. The truth, as many people already know is that the album has too many filler tracks. However, despite the fillers, there are enough good songs on the double CD to make a dope Jay-Z album. Personally, I liked about half of the songs on the album and just made a new CD with just the songs I liked...So I recommed you get the album...Its not his best work, but still better than most of his other work. Don't listen to the critcs!"
4,Jay Z this Jay Z that,"This album is not of the caliber of 2 Pacs ""all eyez on me"" but it is still a good cd. In my belief Jay could have combine the 2 discs into 1 and made an INCREDIBLE cd but I still have to say that the cds each have very good tracks on it, ranging from ""dream"" to his nas rebuttle(he kills nas) ""blueprint2."" The cds are packed with music and you can pretty much keep ur hand away from the fastforward button for the most part."
1,One for effort,"For starters this album is horrible! What was jay-z thinking? 25 song's on the album, when in reality he should have used the better 11 for an Lp or the top 5 worth listening to for a CD sampler. The vast majority of the material sounds a bit rushed and even a little desperate. There is actually nothing new as far as content is concerned. Same ole, same...can we hear something a little deeper than how much money you have? Not to mention the recycled material. The song features B.I.G. It uses a verse from juicy. Not to mention how he butchers 2-pac's beat from ""Me & My Girlfiend"" and tried to spice it up with a not needed spanish guitar...Lets not forget how 2pac HATED Jay-Z why would you want to sample a beat from a legend who coulnd't stand you? The whole feel of the album is been there done that. The opposite is what made the orignal BP so bomb. These song's must be the leftovers. Well, all good things come to an end. Back to the drawing board Jay..."
1,Blueprint to people who need to stop rappin',Jay Z needs to take a break... a LONG break! Ya all of you can hate on this review cuz I'm putting down your pop star but you ALL know the truth... he needs to quit for a while or do some of us a favor and do it forever. Seriously cuz even if Jay Z got a ouiji board and thought he contacted Pac he should not use his songs and showing all this love for him cuz the real heads know STILL REMEMBER how pac felt about Jay Z. So Pac's mom can show all the support and everybody can do a tribute with PUFF DADDY we all know Pac isn't getting his peace while he's turning in his grave.
4,just got it at bestbuy,"man what are yall people sayin?nas's new cd is really bad and this cd is tight.it got bout 20 good tracks and only 5 not that good tracks.his flow is unstoppable,especially on ""hovi baby""-""cant break the unbreakable,shake the unshakeable"",etc.but anyway the bad tracks are the last three songs on the gift(1st cd),2 many and and #10 on the the curse.I like the curse a little bit better than the gift,mainly cuz of songs like guns and roses,u dont know remix(better than the original!MOP rocks!)and his tribute to pac(some people hate).but this is mostly bangin,and one of his best albums.its the year's second best album after the eminem show.BUY IT NOW.peace to all those who don't hate on this."
1,no stars,"after the dissapointment of the blueprint this just rips the you know what, this is a poor attempt of a double disc rap album and it shames the rap game.bonnie and clyde feat beyoncee is wack and the whole is just as wack, as usual you got j tryin to diss nas which is impossalbe considerin nas is the best since pac, jigga will never beat or recover from either where nas teard jigga to pieces.its hard to figure out whos worse j or ja rule.if you want some top double disc albums get all eyez on me by pac and the art of war by bone thugs"
3,The Gift and the Curse,"Jay-Z is the rapper you really want to hate, but just can't. He's cocky, commercialized and overplayed, yet it's hard to deny that he consistantly drops great albums year after year.That has now changed (well, sort of) with the sequel to the Blueprint.Jiggaman drops 10 or 11 hot tracks on the album...problem is, there are 25 songs.In the age of Internet file sharing, one has to wonder why anyone would be willing to buy an album full of mostly filler, but that is exactly what we get here.It's that simple. If you like using the skip button, go right ahead and buy this...if you like a smooth straight through listen, don't waste your money."
4,Jay Z Samples In This One,"Good Cd, Great Music. But, like most popular hip hop artists Jay Z sampled music to create the song ""Guns and Roses"" Featuring Lenny Kravitz. I would say 95% of the people who bought this cd has no idea where the beat actually came from. Do you know? If not he got it from the band Cake. There song ""Arco Arena"" off of there latest album ""Comfort Eagle."" Take a listen its the same song. Cake never put words to the song. Its just a minute and a half instrumental, but Jay Z and Lenny pulled it off. They made a hit song, that will do better than his debut song off the album with Byonce Knoles. I guarantee it."
2,Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse,"Compared to Blueprint 1, it doesnt have the same feel as this one does, and the filler tracks seem to bring down its likness. There are some real good songs on the album, but its not enough form a two disc album. He should of stuck with a one cd album."
2,Jay did not cut it.,"I am disappointed in Jay-Z. Maybe he should start writing his rhymes and concentrate on the music he is making instead of trying to get at other rappers. This album is worst than ""The Best of Both Worlds"". Overall Jay-Z can do much better than this, take it back to Reasonable Doubt for the sake of the fans."
2,Yo! Get This Money! Yeah Yeah Yeah!,"Uh, when will people get tired of Jigga? His flow gets weaker and more arrogant with every album. Nas can take a massive dump on this. The only reason I have to give this two stars is because Ja Rule is still the king of all that is wack, and so my one-star reviews are reserved for him."
2,C'mon Jigga,"I know you can do better. There was very little effort put into this cd unlike the first Blueprint. There are a few good songs, but thats pretty much it."
2,Not Jigga's best effort,"Blueprint 2 - The gift and the curse, isnt BP1. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs (I Did It My Way, Hovi Baby), but most of the songs are pure filler (2 Many Hoes, F**k All Nite, Exuse Me Miss). I thought the Amazon review by Dalton Higgins was totally right, he should of known not to make a double cd, especially in such a short time, no artist has ever made a classic 2 cd album. It looks like Jigga is gonna have destroy and rebuild with him and his 'rat pack', to find a way to make a cd as good as his first classic cd, ""Reasonable Doubt""."
2,Uses for The Gift disc on Blueprint 2,"The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes...1. Frisby2. Mirror3. Toilet paper4. Shooting target5. Trash"
2,jays gotta call it quits for a awhile,"ive always been a jay-z fan but seems like this album was his worst..I agree with other people that said he is doin commercial rap cuz he is just doin it for the money. This album was a waste of time and I am so sorry i bought it. Plus, naming it ""blueprint 2??"" Bad move jay, if i remember right ur last album was blueprint. I expected somethin better. If jay was reading this I would tell him to cool it for awhile and think bout your lyrics..change ur style. Ever since the nas vs. jay-z battle i was always for jay-z cuz the blueprint album was so good and most of his others (cept dyansty) But ever since this blueprint 2 I think i'll go with Nas unless Jay changes his style."
2,Is the originality gone?,"My only qualms with this album is the fact that just about every song has several samples from other artists. The songs themselves are good. I didn't expect something of such low quality from a man like Jay-Z. I have all his albums, but after this one, I think my confidence in him has slided a little. Definately not a waste of money but not for die hard Jay-Z fans."
2,His very weakest effort. 2 stars.,"I can't believe J fell off with this one. I mean it was so direction-less and empty. To think I wanted to spend 17 bucks on this was pure craziness.This was back in 2002 and Jay-Z has stepped up his game a bit since then, but I'm still not impressed on a whole. The Black Album was decent stuff (Change Clothes, Allure, Encore and 99 Problems (the latter two being the biggest highlights).But this one's a mess. I remember Excuse Me Miss, B&C; '03 Bonnie & Clyde and that's IT.I hated Jay-Z after this album. I don't to this day, but back then I was more than sorely disappointed with this mess.I'm just glad he improved with all future releases without fail. Good thing The Dynasty: Roc La Familia 2000 wasn't after this. I'd have to take back my word a little.Cover Art: COther Art: ?Songwriting: D-Vocals: C-Vocal Emotion: F+Vocal Acrobatics: N/AProduction: C+Length: C+2 stars.Overall: D-"
4,Nice,"This balun works as expected. It's a solid piece, so it will be there for the long haul. And it's a great price!"
4,"Might work, but...","I found out that the roof-mounted antenna on my apartment building doesn't work (or the wall connection doesn't work). Not going to fault the product for it, though. Will attempt to build my own antenna now."
5,"Unfinished, but excellent","This was Stevenson's last novel and is unfinished, though it is known how it was going to finish. The main feature of the plot is the relationship between Lord Hermiston, a judge renowned for his stringency, and his more liberal (but still fairly well-behaved) son. The plot is of course a lot more complex than that, and the father is absent for most of even what Stevenson wrote before his death.It is a very Scottish novel, with large portions of it taking place in the Scottish countryside, with clan relations, etc. and with most of the dialogue in Scots.Some of the characterisation is excellent, and if it had been finished with Stevenson's usual ability along the suggested storyline, it would have been a very moving novel indeed."
1,Review of paperback Knots by R D Laing,I returned the first two copies (which were to be gifts) because the print was almost totally illegible; a second shipment had the same dreadful print job and I returned them as well.
2,Not impressed,"This book is about Cat, a troubled teenager, sharing her story of incest and other abuses to a group of other troubled teenagers. Cat is whiny and unbelievable, as are the rest of the girls in her group. The book closes with an aura of hopelessness: the world is a terrible place and it's never going to get any better.I used to like V.C. Andrews' books, but either I've outgrown them or the new ghostwriter doesn't match up to Andrews' original style. This book is targeted towards teens but the subject matter isn't appropriate. I believe teenagers can handle difficult issues like incest in mature ways, but this book seems to almost glorify it."
2,Dated!,"Upon re-reading this book after many years, I found that unconditionally embracing what were once Friday's unique perspectives on our relationships, especially with our mothers, is as bad as buying into society's bill of goods as to who we are and who we're supposed to be as women. There was a time when these ideas were on the mark, but for any person who questions what they read and are told by the ""experts,"" this book can be disturbing in its rigidity. No modern free-thinkers need apply!"
2,Text is difficult to read (scanning errors?),"This review is just about a technical issue with the book. I don't know if it is a bad scan or what, but some of the text is unreadable. I would suggest checking some of the other versions of this at Amazon."
1,Excellent description of present and future conditions,"This book describes the present condition in the world. Henry Ford stated that it is largely irrelevant who is the author or authors of the book because it describes unfolding events. However, it would seem that the Jews find what is stated in the book favorable and without doubt promote the direction described. James"
4,"Yes, Get it!","As a doula, should you spend the money for this tiny little book? What could it say that all of the other books haven't covered? GET IT! Labor is a journey and no book maps out as many possible scenarios on that journey as the Labor Progress Handbook. Easy-to-find information and suggestions that are quickly accessed during the birth plus priceless information to review outside of labor means the birth team has more tools in the toolkit. I loaned mine to a new doula and never saw it again! It is the one book I wish that I had never let out of my sight!Excellent resource for nurses, doulas, midwives, OBs - - anyone in the room where mothers give birth!"
4,Good,This cable has served it's purpose but I think it's starting to give me a problem. I can't hear anything coming from this cable until I jiggle it around. I probably will have to buy something thicker or stronger.
3,WorldWide,This is a good album but there is only 8 track not includingIntro or outro.that is the only downfall of the albumit's a great album.
4,Bluelight Party-Down Music,"""Worldwide Underground"" is a great party album.It's highly groove-based. I love ""Back In TheDay"" the most but all the other are hot too. Ican't wait to take this cd when I drive home forthe holidays."
2,Badu now stands for bad.,"As an avid loving and adoring fan of E. Badu. I was extremly disappointed in this cd. I almost want to ask if she was on drugs when she recorded this album. It doesn't reflect the creative and innovative Badu that I once knew. The lyrics lack true writing skills and the vocals are a bit tired and predictable. I won't abandon her but I also wouldn't reccomend this cd to anyone who wants to hear really good music. If you want to get your money's worth then buy Kindred, Kem, Floetry, or Ledisi. I am alsolooking forward to Rhian Benson's cd when it drops."
3,Erykah!!,"She is such a brilliant artist, but even they have off moments from time to time and I guess this is it for Erykah. I appreciated the experiment on first listening, but I didn't particularly want to hear it again. Stand out track is ""Back in the Day""."
5,SHE'S BACCCCKKKKKK!!!!!,"Wow..I can't stop listening to this CD. She is definitely back!!I've been listening to it for 3 days non-stop. She took it back to the first album!!! It's funky, it's soulful and she has some bangin beats!!!"
4,Music for music lovers,"PURE ERYKAH. After my first listen, i'm pleased! A huge erykah fan, me like everyone else has been dying for this since Love of My Life last year. My one dissapointment for this release is that the single does not completly find it's way on the album, but a reworking remix of sorts featuring queen latifah and angie stone provides funky satisfaction. The rest of the album is pure erykah but unlike any of her other releases, it's more sounds beats and grooves, pure soul going off and doing her thing. all i can say is listen and crank it up, cause if you love this lady, you will love this collection! i've seen this woman in concert and this album takes off where the studio's and live album left off. mad love for badu!"
1,WHAT IS THIS MESS??????,"Ever since the dreaded ""Badu Live"" CD, Erykah Badu has drifted into mainstream, commercialistic garbage, releasing songs that sound nothing like, or similar to those on her ground-breaking debut, ""Baduizm."" She further drifts into R&B oblivion with her latest release of ""Worldwide Underground."" After what I sampled from a friend, refusing to buy it after hearing the monotonous ""Mama's Gun,"" I was very disappointed! Even my friend can't get with this one, and he's as big a Badu fan as I am, or was. ""Danger"" and ""Bump It"", the only ear-catching songs here can't even save this CD from musical ennui. Erykah repeats hooks way too many times, songs linger on forever and the beats are so lifeless they need a defibrillator to revive them. EB dropped the ball on this one, and if she doesn't hurry and return to the down-home soulful, funk flava that permeated ""Baduizm"", I'm gonna have to stop listening to her...BUT, uhhm, I'm kinda doin that now. Better luck next time, Erykah!"
1,And they wonder why people swap music,I heard it twice and don't care if I never hear it again. I regret the purchase.
5,Peace Love and Respect to Erykah,"I love Erykah Badu so much and I relate to her more than any other musician. We're both vegetarian, into natural ways of life, and both deeply spiritual. Worldwide Underground was written during a very depressing time in the world, right after September 11th and the beginning of the Bush's stupid war, and I think the music reflects that. Yet, in the song, ""Love of my life Worldwide"" she says ""Don't cha give up, keep goin', keep goin'..."" and that always inspires me. We're coming to a new age of existance where two groups will be formed: Those for the revolution (A peaceful, godly one, I pray) and those against it!"
5,Canon L50 toner cartridge,"Received new in Canon box, on time as advertised and at a substantial discount off the big chain stores. Will buy again."
3,Can't beat the price.,"When I ordered this product, I believed it to be a genuine Canon cartridge. However, what arrived was remanufactured. I was a bit upset about that, but decided that I should not have expected more when the price was so much less than what I usually pay. The toner makes nice copies and has been lasting for the number of copies expected. The only complaint I have is that it makes a 'clicking' noise during copying that the original cartridges do not make. I have not used a remanufactured cartridge before, so I don't have anything to compare that to. It doesn't seem to affect the machine itself, so it is more of a nuisance than a problem. I probably would have purchased this item again, but I now see it is no longer available on Amazon. Huh....."
2,Just average,"Overall, an average documentary (disc 1) that tries to view both sides of the battle for the Alamo and San Antonio.However, I found it rather apalling that some historians are now labeling the heroic leaders inside the Alamo, as ""drunkards"", ""criminals"", ""land swindlers"" and ""wife abandoners"", claiming that their main reason for leaving the United States and heading to Texas was to escape their problems and crimes.They then label General Santa Anna as a great military leader, much like Napoleon. They forget to mention that Santa Anna was a brutal dictator and later captured without a shred of military insignia, and had to be identified by his own men.Just another example of Revisionist's history.If you want to know what more likely happened at the Alamo, I suggest you read, Walter Lords book, ""A Time to Stand"". By far the best literature on the subject."
4,80's Flashback,"I remember watching this movie on cable and on T.V., I was too broke to go to the movies back then and I was only thirteen at the time so on a personal level it takes me back to a nice time,plus that ROD STEWART SONG "" LOVE TOUCH "" plays on my head especially the previews when DEBRA WINGER and ROBERT REDFORD plunge into a lake on a forklift or something like it..ITs like ""WHO's JOHNNY"" and ""SHORT CIRCUIT "" . You hear one and think of the other."
3,Its Fine,The ox is just what its states the box will be...if you wanna be freakin WOWed than no but if you want an nice clean simple box then this is it.
1,Is this book writen in English ??,I would recommend the author to learn how to speak English before to write a book.
5,Reclamando su espacio en el mundo de la salsa,"Creo que Tito Gomez ha restaurado la fe de todos los seguidores de su musica. Este disco es muy unico, algo bien diferente de sus otras grabaciones. Me gusta todo de esta produccion. La salsa es buena, alegre, canta con claridad y puedes escuchar el disco de principio a fin. No hay ninguna cancion mala. En este disco Tito G nos recuerda que el es uno de los mejores cantantes aunque en los ultimos tiempos no tiene la fama que tenia a principio de los anos noventa. No estaba muy contenta con su disco anterior- Quien nos iba a decir por lo tanto decidi darle otro chance porque sabia que era capaz de retomar su lugar en el mundo musical. Vale la pena comprar el disco, el estilo de la salsa te traera buenas memorias de cuando el estaba en la gloria. Es un cd muy excepcional y merecedor de tu patrocinio."
3,Great for TV (Bad for cable modem),"I bought this a bit ago because I was having problems with my cable modem disconnecting during downloads and since I had tried different coax cables/network cables/routers I figured this would be the last step to try.For cable TV it worked great,channels come in perfectly,cable modem synced up and worked and all seemed well until it started to disconnect again on downloads.I happened to find an old splitter in my closet that I thought I had lost and now everything works perfectly..it so happens to be another RCA splitter.I am not really sure what the problem is with my original splitter from the cable company and this one but just to warn anyone with a cable modem that if you experience problems this could be it."
5,The Man's a Born Teacher,"If you want to learn how to play jazz sax, I would recommend that you get your hands on every product that Eric Marienthal has put out. I did. Some of them are not that easy to find now, but you can try his web-site to get most of them. Once you get them, use them and practice, practice, practice!"
1,Product was defective,"Unfortunately the guitar I ordered was defective. The body didn't have a scratch and it was really beautiful. However, the setup was so messed up that the strings didn't actually produce any sound. In fact, they sounded like a bunch of elastic bands as opposed to actual strings. It went way beyond buzzing; it didn't produce any sound that resembled a guitar. I returned the product and received my money back.I haven't given up on Luna alltogether; I have another Luna guitar which I really love to play. I appreciate the smaller size (compared to average guitars), and the sound is pretty nice. But I am a bit surprised about how this instrument even left the factory; I'd assume they have a QA process in place."
3,RUSH,"The cellphone is sleek and excellent......but b preapred for sum nastiness by CINGULAR for sure....they charge u and start billing u the day u order the celphone online.....its so ridiculous.....u get billed for the time u havent even recieved the handset,leave alone starting it...so buyers beware u wanna take this wit some other service provider.....the phone is good,no doubts about it,problem is the service provider!!!and their customer service is soooo sloppy,they dont operate on sundays and even on other days only till 9 pm...if u r on a call wit them,it automatically gets disconnected at 9 !!! how ridiculous can they get???"
4,Good phone,"I bought a D807 and a logtech Mobile Free Headset from amazon. They rock! This phone has all features I need. Bluetooth and camera. The voice dialing is very cool. If you want to call somebody when driving, all you need to do is press the button of the bluetooth earpiece and say ""call ***"", then the cell phone will confirm and connect automatically. This is awesome coz you won't worry to be caught by cops when driving and more importantly, you are safer."
1,The reception quality is very bad,The reception quality of this phone is very bad. Voice breaks alot even outside building. Other cingular phones work great inside room as well but not this one.
3,"Good on looks, ok on functionality",I got this phone but discovered that it had a major flaw - the backlight stays on during charging which can be quite disturbing if you leave your phone by bedside for charging. Got it exchanged for a sony W810i.Other cons -Does not come with handsfree headset.Does not come with PC to phone cable.Address book is not very user friendly (true for all samsungs).Pros -Good looks and good layout of top buttons.
3,Some great features ... some not so great.,"Pros:- Great looking phone- Great sound/video quality. Excellent speaker phone- Voice activation/recognition ... best I have used.- Contact list ... multi-number per user, picture and custom ringer.Cons:- Ringer volume -- way too low .. my wife and I both miss calls constantly- Vibrate alert -- way too low .. constantly miss calls on vibrate- LCD screen -- cracked after 3 months .. $119 to fix.I wouldn't buy it again and won't repair it."
3,haven`t used yet,well i bought this to use but my new stereo has one built in and didn`t reall need it so it has set in my car for a while in the box got what was advertised and got it quick
5,Wonderful,"An incomparable text in the history of European letters. Rilke's letters to a young man who is contemplating military service, are a testament to the poetic spirit. Rilke's devotion to the life of solitary contemplation and writing is an ascetic principle in its full actualization. Through a life of naturalist ingestion and calm interiority, Rilke's poesy emerged at the forefront of all art. His insights into the nature of writing, of poetic creation, and literature are true miracles of subjective reflection. This text is a personal statement-a window into a poetic life devoted to nature, spirit, and the music of words. Truly an astonishing text."
4,Raw EWF!,"For those who are interested in EWF on their way to becoming one of the greatest bands in pop history, this album is a must have. I love their music recorded in the late 70s, but the real EWF sound was cemented in the early-mid 70s. Their best music always harkens back somehow to what you hear on this album. Get this and marvel at the evolution of The Fire!"
5,best bakeware....great price,"i m already using one right now, and i like it so much, it is very heavey duty aluminium...totally non-stick...even if u want food to stick it...wont't.....very very very easy to clean...and i m planing to purchase another for me. but i guess it is not availble right now on Amazon.com...."
1,"Looks great at the store, will rust in a week","My husband and I registered for this flatware set for our wedding because it looked and felt great; it had a quality weight to it, and seemed very sturdy. Well about 2 weeks after the wedding we noticed that they were spotty, and soon after realized that the spots were turning to rust. This rust only got worse after every wash, either by had or dishwasher. This set is definitely not worth the higher price it goes for. We were very very disappointed."
4,"It works, but is pricey","I bought this to use w/ a Netgear WG302 v2. The most important thing to know in advance is that it does NOT come w/ a cable to attach to the wireless access point. Netgear recommends using any of its own branded antenna cables, and this is what I did. I am using the 5m cable (ACC 10314-03) and it works.However, I found that the WG302 with this antenna has provides less coverage for my 2 story colonial house than a Netgear WPN802 v1. I set the WPN802 into repeater mode and use the WG302 with this antenna as the access point. This arrangement works for me."
4,Does it matter why one goes to war?,"This is the story of a young man who was in the front lines with an embedded video journalist. The young man is charismatic. He seems levelheaded. That's why they'd made him a sergeant. Then he's seriously wounded on his right side. The journalist embeds himself in the young man's civilian life thereafter. The contrast of who this person is startling between him in uniform on a battlefield, and him in civilian cloths in a department store looking at the video games. While at times the movie was moving ""tediously"", as another reviewer rightly mentions, what's most startling to me is his explanation why he joined the marines: to kill."
3,sfchollon,"Ok film, Kind of a short documentry. Follows a soldiers return hoe from combat, and his difficulties re-adjustng. Good film to watch for family and friends. They can get an ideal what you are dealing with."
4,Watch with Caution - Good Depiction of the New Normal,"Well done movie about the new normal for some returning veterans. Use caution when viewing - there are a few battle scenes that are graphic and a Memorial Service that is pretty heart wrenching. It is worth watching if you can get through those scenes. Not all veterans come back to face these issues but some do, and it is a real view of what your neighbor or relative might be going through."
3,A DIFFERENT book,"When i got this book, i thought it would be about Prue, Piper, and Pheobe. But as it turned out, it wasn't. I thought it was okay, but i would reccomend it for charmed fans who are not really ""INTO"" charmed."
5,Professional quality in every aspect,"I had a small unit that switched speaker on and off and the speaker wire kept popping out. I purchased the 6 station Niles to replace it. This unit has some physical weight, there is nothing tinny about it. The knobs and switches have a smooth yet positive feel. The attachments for the speaker wire are really the best part for me. You can remove the attachment blocks for each speaker, attach the wires (screw clamps) and then slide the blocks into the back of the unit. This is extremely helpful if your stereo is in a tight location as mine is. Also, the size of the wire openings is large enough to accommodate heavier gauge speaker wire. Finally, I am very happy being able to adjust the speaker volumes in different locations from the stereo. I have two sets outside and they have to be turned up higher, yet I don't want to blast out people inside."
1,Cross talk on Niles 6 speaker switch,"I bought the Niles 6 speaker selector on Amazon 6 months ago to replace my 6 speaker Monster switch that died on me. First, I couldn't beleive how small the connectors were! it was almost impossible to wire compared to the Monster Switch, but I thought ok, this is higher end equipment so once its done I'll be ok. After meticulously wiring all six speakers I noticed that I had cross talk, that is, when a speaker wasn't selected you could hear a noticeable sound from each spearker even though the volume control was off and the speaker unswitched. That to me was unacceptable. I played with it and couldn't fix it so I am replacing it with another Monster. I had heard mixed reveiws on Niles products and now I get it, they are not detail oriented."
1,Will NOT purchase LETTER BOX Movies,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition)Will NOT purchase any LETTER BOX movieIF NOT FULL SCREEN they can keep it..
3,"Good, but no franchise starter","Its just not in the same league as the other films, including Temple of Doom."
2,Possibly one of the worst movie I've seen this year.,"I've enjoyed the first three Indiana Jones. Sure some fans feel the second was a bit weak, others feel the third was the weaker. And everyone felt that the first one was a classic. But for sure most everyone will agree that this fourth installment is awful - although the opening 5 minutes seemed promising.Clearly this movie has the paws of George Lucas all over it, in an effort to establish a franchise with the Indiana Jones' son taking over and before it becomes Indiana Jones and the search for Geritol.Also another sign of George Lucas's interference is in the indiscriminate overuse of special effects. I guess his effects company, Industrial Light and Magic needed some more work.As far as I am concerned the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Harrison Ford et al. riding off into the sunset is a fitting end to the series. Definately won't be buying this episode to ""complete"" my set.This movie is utter cash grabbing garbage."
5,Absolutely great!,"I just finished watching this movie and it is fantastic. Lots of adventure, terrific special effects, and lots of fun. It is every bit as good as the first three, and possibly better. I recommend it highly."
1,Who is giving this movie 5 stars?,"Why? If you're a big fan of the first three, and have managed to not see this stinker then please, I beg you, hold on to the memories you cherished and don't let greed ruin a great trilogy for you. Hopefully Crystal Skull will end up being universally ignored like Terminator 3 and we can all collectively pretend like it never happened. This movie was beyond bad and added absolutely nothing to the ground work that was previously laid. It's a real shame... Save yourself, look away!"
2,Indy Has Jumped The Shark,"Ouch.... this was painful to sit through.I wanted to like it, I really did. The original RotLA was intense and exhilirating, with a great plot and storyline. I thought the last one released, where Indy's dad (Sean Connery) participates, was getting a bit hokey, but this last one was hopefully really the last one.Shia LeBouf as a 50s tough? SnortThis film was actually an exercise in how much really lousy CGI the studio could cram into its time frame. The entire thing was so patently unbelievable and cornball that any attempt at suspending disbelief was simply out of the question. For this we waited so long?No more please. Indy has jumped the shark and the sun is setting. This is what happens when people make movies only for the money."
4,"Not the best Indy movie, but worth watching.","This movie is by no means the best Indiana Jones movie out there, but it is certainly worthy of being in the franchise. This movie has a very similar feel to the original trilogy, but it has some differences, too. Lucas and Spielberg have mentioned that the original movies were made in the style of the old 1930's serials. They decided to film this one a little more like the 1950's sci-fi ""B"" movies. This works very well in the new movie, which uses the much of the same witty dialogue and over-the-top action sequences that make the Indiana Jones series so unforgettable. I definitely recommend this movie to any Indy fan."
2,Disapointed,"The movie was OK, certainly not as good as the others. However the biggest problem is if your Blue Ray player/TV connects together using Component cables you will only see 480i. Paramount has apparently disabled the HD output unless an HDMI cable is used. Recommend you buy the standard DVD if your setup needs Component cables. I have never seen this issue on any other disks."
1,Utter travesty of a movie that wouldnt be worth buying even if it had $50 note inside the front cover.,"Poorly thought out movie with even worse execution. By lazily putting Indy in his old get-up the filmmakers heighten Harrison Fords aged look. He reminded me of the old guys who wear pants too big and have to hike them up to their armpits. Storywise..if we skim past the fact that they are searching for aliens....which they find, and that there is a psychic character which is never explained...the plot lollops along from one rediculous set up to another. Want examples? name your poison!...surviving a nuclear bomb by hiding in a fridge?.. er swinging through the trees with a mass of cgi comedy monkeys, eaten by ants or whatever....just utter nonsense.In no way encourage such fecal matter by buying this dross. Go buy Raiders of the lost Ark and try and remember a happier time when Indiana Jones was cool."
2,Not Indianna Jones,"I can sum up this movie in 5 words, what was the director thinking? What really made this movie unbearable and just absolutly ridiculous was the the script! The mysterious crystal skull plot from the begining I felt was stupid, from the moment I saw it in the theater. And the way it lead to Aliens was just plain si-fi foolishness. I don't want to make too big a deal over it, but that's not the traditional Indiana Jones theme. I'm sure if you all remember they were no other wordly creatures in any of the movies. This was one was a real mockery of Indiana Jones. I have no desire to buy it, really, and I don't think the traditional Indiana fans would either."
4,"Not great, but very underrated or over-hated","I was initially disappointed by this movie when I saw it in theaters. Fast forward three years, and I like it a LOT better. It's not great, but it's definitely not bad or terrible. In many ways it feels like the older ones, though it's definitely different (though I'd honestly say that Temple of Doom is the most different out of the 4. In fact, I think I like Indy 4 more than Temple of Doom).If you're an Indy fan and want to complete the collection, or if you really like or love Indy 4, then this is a very good DVD because it contains plenty of featurettes about the making of this film. This movie is overall very good popcorn entertainment."
3,About what I Thought it would be,"Don't get me wrong, I love Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford. I like this movie but I don't love it. Sean Connery was 53 the last time he played Bond and Roger Moore was 57. They both looked too old for the part. Ford is 65. The last guy to punch out bad guys at a similar age was John Wayne. There are some nice touches : bring back Karen Allen, acknowledging the passing of Denholm Elliot. Rosewell? Crystal Skulls? Worth having as part of an overall Indy collection. It's better than the three turds Lucas calls his chapters I-III of STAR WARS saga."
5,What is wrong with you people?,"i have been an Indiana jones fan since I was a kid. I absolutely loved this. It was in every sense, an Indiana Jones film. Was it perfect, no. But it was a damn good final film. Sure the monkey scene was a bit too cheesy, but the rest was fairly faithful to the Indy formula and Harrison Ford resurrects a 20 year older Indy with perfection. I do not understand what people were expecting. In an age where pieces of crap like Transformers and the Pirates sequels are considered good popcorn entertainment, I welcome Indy back with open arms, even if for the last time. Don't listen to these bad reviews. if you enjoyed the first three films, you'll like this. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun."
1,the wost movie i have ever seen,it was tarruble so bad in fact that i hope the derecters die choking on there own blood
1,How Bad can a movie be?,"Really, really bad...and, just forget that the story is non-existent and is essentially a two-hour chase without end or meaning. No Nazis ths time. It's 1954 so the enemies are Russians. But, get this, our perennial good samaritan Harrison Ford actually climbs inside an abandoned refrigerator! A children's movie for God's sake!--and, Harrison Ford climbs inside an abandoned refrigerator! Oh, btw, the purpose was to protect himself from a nuclear blast. Jeez...need I say more?"
1,very bad,Decent cast of actors but terrible story line and bad acting. Not worth even a renting of this movie. I dont knwo why they thought this was going to be good when they put this together
4,Indy Rocks!,"Indy has to save an old friend,girlfriend and son! Then he gets to marry his old flame! This movie was as classic as any of the original Indy films. My only complaint is that it wasn't as good a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"",but what is?"
4,its just dandy,this movie was really good to indy fans. I liked how natural all the film was really good to watch on a weekend. shia lebeouf is a really good actor and harrison ford doesnt even need to carry him either night
1,Not worth your time,"This is definitely the worst of the Indiana Jones movies, so if you're considering watching this movie, you may want to try cutting your wrists instead."
2,A dreadful waist of time,"Having watched this film for the first time on video recently, I am embarrassed to admit that I could have turned it off at any point with little loss or consequence, but did not. Instead, I plodded my way to the silly end in this plastic film devoid of character or anything more engaging than the D-typical action fare by way of plot. Plastic best describes it. Cardboard characters lacking story, history, or engaging personality. A plot so surface that I couldn't even be bothered to conjecture what might come next - essential activity for suspense. A set that seemed plastic with effects that were uninspiring as well. At the end of this film I cared a great deal more for the two hours I willfully wasted on it than the five measly dollars down the tubes. If you appreciate the one life you have to get by on, you might want to leave this diversion out of your path."
3,Beyond the suspension of disbelief,"What a mess! This movie is just totally ridiculous, from start to finish. Bad dialog, lots of pseudo-science, over-the-top acting -- ""Crystal Skull"" has it all. The CGI special effects are often impressive, but fail to make up for a weak, choppy story line and unbelievable action sequences. As just one small example of how implausible the action gets, the main characters often toss around the titular crystal skull as if it were a football, when a quartz object that size would weigh about 70 pounds! And then there are giant ants, gunpowder that is attracted to magnets, and a whole slew of other improbabilities. And the ""happy ending"" where Indy and Marion get [*******] is just too corny and contrived.I really wish they hadn't made this movie, as it cheapens the reputation of a great 1980s action trilogy. Just one more example of Hollywood sacrificing art for cash."
2,disappointed,"It's too bad that the movie was pushed as a classic Indiana Jones film. It's not. It plays off the others, but the story is lousy. The Fate of Atlantis would have been a much better story. The effects are too computerized. They look too smooth. It looks more like toy story than good artistic filming & effects."
3,Indiana Jones The Crystal Skul,The first part of the movie was better than the second part. It was entertaining and provided continuity with the first three movies. If you are an Indiana Jones fan you will probably like it.
3,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single-Disc Edition),"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single-Disc Edition) is the fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise and unfortunately it is not nearly as good as the other three previous ones. Try as he might, the magic of Indy is just not there. The storyline is just all-right and the the dialogue so so. The special effects are good but nothing that I have not seen before. Overall an film that is just descent. However, this is just the problem. An Indiana Jones film should be awesome. Still I give it a 3 out of 5."
2,Go Greif,I give this movie 2 stars due to its amalzying true protrayal of KGB agents. Other then that there is NOTHING IN THIS FILM I WOULD LIKE ANYONE TO SEE EVER.
4,Very Good,"It's difficult for one to be as good as the original but this is still an entertaining movie with a good variety of action, thrills and excitement."
5,Indiana Jones,this was a great moviea movie the whole family would likeIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was my favoritealot of action
2,Just plain bad,"Mild spoilers -I can deal with magic/aliens, but there still needs to be rules to a movie world. Once those rules are broken it removes the viewer from the experience. Indy 4 did this a lot. He survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator, plus the refrigerator flies through the air a couple miles lands and Indy just pops up. Mutt hops up in the trees and swing like some CG Tarzan with monkeys, then the monkeys attack the Russians. Why did they monkeys attack the Russians? Oh yeah, I forgot about the monkey vs Russian war of 1975. Then all the characters go down, not one but three waterfalls, that make Niagara falls look like a children's slip and slide. There is NO sense of danger. In the first 3 movies you knew Indy would pull though, but Indy still seemed to be worried about his situation. Here, everyone just showed up to get paid."
3,not impressed,"Well, I guess this is the last of the Indiana Jones that I will watch. In the past the locations were real and so was the action. Oh well, so much for computer generated movies,need I say more?"
1,George Lucas destroys everything he touches,"Save your money.This latest installment is clumsy and poorly executed -- and no amount of second disc extras and outtakes is going to fix that.Set aside the 'aliens isn't archaeology' factor -- it's just a badly made movie. It's full of plot holes and leaps in logic that distract, as well as fight scenes and shoot outs that are right out of Mystery Science Theater.Honestly, I kept looking for Jar Jar Binks.Lucas needs to realize that those old serials he loves so much aren't that well made. And that he already did his long drawn out homage to his childhood with the Outsiders ...Go buy yourself a copy of Last Crusade or Raiders instead."
2,OH NO!!!!,"This is so boring! The acting is cheesy as can be and I dont mean in a classic, Indiana Jones waay either. This is just bad bad bad. There are scenes in it where it is so obviously a Hollywood studio its laughable. I fell asleep 5 times trying to get through this awful movie. Harrison should have stopped at the last one. No chemistry between actors at all and the story is just forgettable due to how bad this movie is."
2,Indy is back... yeah-yeah... tragically.,"BEWARE! I just (tried) to watch my copy, and I was shocked that my feature film disc was defected. The error starts at the scene when Indy is being interrogated by his double crosser friend, whatshisname, and then the picture freezes, and it continues only when I skip the movie with the button, and the next playable scene is when the old guy starts to auto write. Well, I'm quite dissapointed, not just by this outrageously mediocre sequel to a glorious franchise, but the idea, that this is my very first defected blu-ray disc. I wouldn't have watched Indy IV. many times anyway, but now that my disc is broken, I'm pissed. Please watch your copy to be sure, yours doesn't have a problem, because it may also well be a serial mistake. Well, now my remaining enthusiasm towards the new Indiana Jones-flick has faded."
1,Indiana Jones' biggest loser.,I sort of knew before I viewed this film that I might be dissapointed and I was. The first two IJ flicks were great while the third with Sean Connery was lagging. While Shia Leboef was great Crystal Skull tried but the whole film sucked in the end. Too bad.
1,The worst of Indiana Jones,"I really like Indiana Jones but this was too much. I started to watch it 5 times and still can't get through it. it is terrible. What can I say. No real plot, No great acting. It's just awful."
2,George Lucas Needs to STOP!!!!!,"Wow, leave it to George Lucas to ruin a franchise. The only 2 good ideas he's ever had Star Wars and Indiana Jones, have been completely ruined by him. KOTCS is full of cheesy affects (I hate those Monkeys),and horrible dialogue.The only terrific thing in this movie is Harrison Ford. The man, the legend is back and manages to salvage this CGI mess.Seriously, why so much CGI??? Take a lesson from movies like The Dark Knight and just use old fashion film making.If there will be a 5th, I'm all for it, but keep Lucas out."
1,What a disapointment!,This movie sucked. All that time waiting for the script and the rewrites for this piece of garbage.Should have been called Raiders of the lost plot or Indiana Jones and the lazy director. George Lucas is by far the worst director in the world. What a waste of $7. Would have given it no stars if that was an option.
3,"A fond, not excellent, fourth outing","I love Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBoeuf, but I did not love Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. I very much enjoyed the nods to previous Indiana Jones films, and the cinematography and special effects were excellent.This outing didn't have the excitement and cohesiveness of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the sheer spectacle of The Temple of Doom, or the charm and heart of The Last Crusade. That said, this movie had some wonderful high points. If you don't like ants, there's a scene you should skip.I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of five as there are a few scenes that might give them nightmares. This is an ideal adventure movie to watch with your older children."
3,A sad dissappointment,"I bought this movie without reading any reviews. After all, as an Indiana Jones fan I was expecting a movie of the Raiders of the Lost Ark caliber. This movie fell way short of my expectations. With many adventure movies there are a lot of implausible scenes and happenings that require you to really stretch your limit of acceptance."
2,END FOR INDY,"Wow, you know when Speilberg misses he really misses. Im in my thirties so I grew up on Indiana Jones and I was really jazzed that they were making a new one...uh until I saw the finished product that is. Harrison Ford, geritol love him, does his very best, and frankly he is by far and away the best thing about this movie. Let me state right off, I am no fan of Shia LaBouef, I just dont get his popularity at all, and he is totally miscast in this film, and lord, Cate Blachette is just as bad, that accent is hilarious. Really, I cant state strongly enough how disappointed I was in this film, if it had not been for my love of Harrison Ford, I would have given it one star. Hopefully, this is the last Indy, it's just a shame it had to end on such a lackluster film..Professor Jones deserved better, hellz I deserved better..really I want my money back..hummm..wonder who I contact."
1,Indiana Jones should have accepted tenure and wrote books for the rest of his career,"Aside from the major impossiblities that have been pointed out a thousand times (surviving in the fridge, Tarzan swing, and the list goes on..), my problem with the story is that introducing aliens goes completely away from what I thought the 'Indy universe' was all about. Indy was always searching for religious relics, whether it was the ark, the holy grail, or the stones. They weren't all Christian relics, but they were religious in nature. Introducing the alien element just takes a sudden turn into another world. I think that I could have given this a 3 star rating if the aliens had been some kind of Gods instead. At least would have kept with the spirit of protecting religious relics. Lucas seems to have fallen in love with CGI and forgot who his characters are.I'm going to have to side with Trey Parker and Matt Stone...Lucas and Spielberg raped Indiana Jones."
1,Worst of the Indiana Jones Releases,After so many years of being without Indiana Jones it would seem that they would have thought more on the topic of their latest release. Surewith the special effects of the series in years gone by it would be hard to assume it could be a reality. However this movie was so far fetched it really didn't make sense.The movie also didn't have substance. The story in the movie was just as if they put this whole storyboard together in 6 hours. With the lack of a great storyline that was expected as in years gone by I would guess this will be the last in the series. If they do come up with another movie then I do hope they will at least give it some thought.In short - Save Your Money or at least wait until it's in the $5.00 bins at your local retail store. I would have given it a lower review but they don't give you an option for negative stars.
1,Speilberg lost his touch.,"What a terrible movie. I know that some movies are meant to be entertaining but this was a ridiculous movie. I liked Temple of Doom way better. The plot of this movie was horrible, see monkey scene to know what I mean. It would have been better off if he did not make a sequel and left the franchise untouched."
1,Waist of time and money,"I grew up on Indiana Jones, the characters, fighting evil (except for the second one that was lame), the melancholy endings are great. So when I heard my nearly 20 year wait for another Indiana Jones movie was over I was excited. What a disappointment when I finally saw it. Have Spielberg and Lucas even seen the first movie? I feel the only point to this movie was to try to revive Harrison Ford's dwindling career and they fell short of there goal. If you're a true Indy fan its best to pretend this movie was never made."
1,Indiana Who,"As much as I (have)liked Harrison Ford, this film just goes to prove that action stars do get old. Keep your dollars, if you absolutely must see it, just rent it."
2,Not a winner,"As a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies, I was excited to see this one, but it disappointed greatly. In fact, it does not even seem like a Steven Spielberg movie at all. Not exciting, and none of the non-stop action of earlier movies. Moreover, the characters were not engaging, with the possible exception of Shia LaBoeuf, who was as engaging as possible for the part he had. The talented Cate Blanchett should have said no to the ridiculous part they gave her, which was reminiscent of Boris and Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle. I didn't care about Karen Allen's character, and Indy just looked tired. The plot was drivel. Aliens? Puh-lease! The only thing that earned this movie two stars was the gorgeous visual impact. The costumes and sets were lush and authentic-looking for their era. It was a beautiful visual treat. Aside from that, I really didn't care for or about this movie at all. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I rented this after hearing the bad reviews, and I'm glad I didn't waste the money to see this in a theater.This film is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The special effects are terrible, the script is awful, and this is absolutely the worst performance I have ever seen from Harrison Ford. He seems tired and bored throughout the entire film, and his supporting cast is no better.I wouldn't watch this again unless I was being paid."
5,A Great Addition To The Indy Legacy,"Loved it! Every bit as good as the first and third movies, and better than the second. Action, adventure, humor and a terrific mix of actors joining Indy and his fedora. I'll watch it again and again. A+++"
1,Even good ol' Harrison couldn't save it.,"This movie has George Lucas' hands all over it. Now 20 years ago that might of been a good thing. But since the Phantom Menace, he must think the general movie going audience's are retards. I was insulted to no end watching this movie, sure it had some fun moments, but fun moments do not a good movie make. The whole thing was predictable, and the parts that were not were just terrible. I still love Harrison Ford and I still love the first 3 films, but there's something that happens to a artist when they're not hungry anymore. They lose that passion that made their early stuff so fun. Spielberg and Lucas are not hungry anymore and this film is another example. I will always cherish their early work. There is no soul here, just a bunch of people who know that if you put ""Indiana Jones"" in the title it's gonna make a lot of cold cash."
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor",Poor execution and a weak script destroy what could have been a memorable adventure. This was the worst in the series and does not belong on the shelf next to the other 3 films.
4,Durable,I love this chair. My hubby and I both fight for it when we're camping. I've had it for over five years now and it's still in great condition.
5,excellent pot,"I love this pot as much as the other reviewer hated it. I was looking for a 4 quart covered casserole (no easy feat) and almost didn't buy this because of the negative review. However, I am interested in increasing my blood iron concentration naturally so I'm trying to cook as much of my food as possible in cast iron. I thought I'd take a chance with this pot. It's an unusual size but it works incredibly well for its purpose. I didn't have the problem with rust spots(which can be easily remedied with a little TLC anyway), love the size and would recommend it to anyone with a knowledge of how to treat cast iron cookware. GET YOUR IRON NATURALLY! COOK WITH CAST IRON!"
3,"Surge died after 1.5 years, but Monster states they have a lifetime warranty!","My surge also seemed to have tripped. I was able to get it working again, but it tripped 3 more times. I gave Monster a call and to my surprise, they mentioned they have a life time warranty on this surge. I saved some money by calling Monster but overall if you want a better surge, you may want to research some other models as others have had similar issues as me. I figure a surge should last longer than 1.5 years. But for the folks that are having trouble, contact Monster if you want a replacement."
1,Monster Cable HT700,"So disgusted. I purchased two. My sons's stopped working in about two months. High-pitched sound and not working. Then, last night mine conked out."
1,Rent-a-surge protector,"Purchased two. One died after a year, thought it was a lemon. Second one just died after 19 months. Don't waste your money."
5,great show,the best show right now. great quality. these are the thirteen words left that are required for me to submit
5,So funny.,My husband got me into this show. I was skeptical at first but it is so hilarious. I definitely recommend watching it.
2,Not my fvorite movie,"Biloxi Blues had its good points, had some great funny parts, but it is not a movie I would watch over and over again. Just doesn't have the appeal to me. Should you see it, by all means, watch all the movies you can, you might like it more then I did."
3,Cheap,This is a cheap basic splitter. I had no problems with it but when the cable guy came to look at something he ripped it out and gave me a new good one. This one is not recommended for cable modems and causes a lot of distortion apparently.
1,fell's weak linguistics/epigraphics again,"In general, there is no good reason to accept Fell's linguistic and epigraphic identifications. See my review of America B.C."
1,firefox movie review,"I received the dvd in a timely manner, but when I tried to play it on both of our dvd players, neither one would play it. Both of them displayed a message saying that this disc can not be played. I was pretty unhappy about that, and am not sure what to do about it now."
5,Xbox cables,"Cables arrived quickly and made life good, agin. There are lots of Xboxs still around and it is good that there is someone that still has items for the game."
1,23 minutes,HELLO? This has to be the shortest movie in history. The scenes were decent. Not sure if the lovers knew each other from before and were acting like they did not (in the beginning of the film) or what. No telling. Good scene with them prancing through an adult shop.
4,Not bad,"Not great either. Some decent scares and tons of suspense. Bruce is mute for his first appearance, but more than makes up for it later. effects are mostly decent and there are more plot twists than you can shake a stick at.Do I love it? No. I'd give it a solid A for a B movie, but a B minus if it were an A movie. I hope that makes sense. Genre fans know what I mean."
4,Nice Little Throwback.,"I watched this last night and I didn't expect much more than a typical ""chick"" horror flick. I was wrong. I won't say this is the second coming of a John Carpenter film, but it was good enough to grab -and keep- my attention. There's good suspense, and while I did figure out the punchline a bit early on, it wasn't enough to make me shut off my television. I don't want to give much away, but it takes place in an all girls school where a powerful secret is being kept. The premise may seem typical, but they did give it a dose of originality.So, from a possible 5, I give it a 4 for those that remember, and enjoy, old skool horror and can have a good time without a metric ton of blood and gore. On a side note, the ""remixed"" version of Lesley Gore's, ""You Don't Own Me"" (it seems to include haunting backing vocals), was a true highlight."
4,A GOOD EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT THRILLER,"THIS IS A SUPERNATURAL THRILLER ABOUT WITCHCRAFT AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM! IT FEATURES A TALENTED CAST AND A UNIQUE STORY!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM!AGNES BRUCKNER IS A TALENTED, BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTRESS WITH A PROMISING CAREER AHEAD! ENJOY!"
3,barnyard,bought this for my daughter it works it very scratch up I wished it was in better condition the read out said in very good condition would hate to see what ok is very scratch up
1,How about an argument from the other side?,"To make a credible TRIAL, one needs a case from both sides. Where is the OTHER side in this? Where is the atheist arguing his/her interpretation of the facts?"
1,Order error by seller or Amazon,"Ordered this item expecting to receive a device for locking the tailgate of my Ford Ranger pick-up. Seller shipped me a box of paper towels. Seller says error is on Amazons end, and sent me a shipping label to return the paper towels... I'll let you know how it comes out and if I ever receive the lock kit as STILL described on Amazon's site.Pop & Lock PL8200 Power Tailgate Lock For Select Ford Trucks"
4,great refresher for me!,"I went back to college to get my Bachelor's degree. I had to retake this subject since it had been awhile since I took it. I ordered this, and it worked!!I made an ""A"" in the class."
5,Worn out my VHS copy,Well written and well played under-rated comedy about a regular Joe who is on a hot streak and his friends' typical gambler reactions. The eye-candy doesn't hurt either.
4,Don't miss this one...,"Let It Ride is one of those lost treasures. Dreyfus is at his comic best and David Johansen (Buster Poindexter), Teri Garr, Jennifer Tilly and the rest of the cast are excellent as well. FUNNY throughout. Leonard Maltin, what were you watching? Featuring some very true-to-the-track moments, this movie wins going away. (Based on the book ""Good Vibes"" by Jay Cronley...read it!)"
4,"Not their Best, but Produced a Pop Hit","First of all, I don't know why people bash this album, calling it a ""pop"" album. Sure, it's a little slower and less edgy than previous albums, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""pop"" album. It features the hit single SECOND CHANCE, which is a pop song. The rest of the album features some pretty good rockers, such as LITTLE SHEBA, HOT'LANTA, and COMIN' DOWN TONIGHT. Another cool but slower song is MIDNIGHT MAGIC. I was pleasantly surprised at the musicianship with these tunes; they're not of ""filler"" caliber. What I really can't believe is that this album came out 23 years ago. I can't believe how fast time has flown by; I remember this album debuting like it was yesterday. One last comment: I think that Donnie Van Zant is easily the best vocalist in the Van Zant family, followed by Ronnie, then Johnny. Donnie was blessed with the best pipes.....that's just my opinion."
4,Very good,Good service and very good dvd quality. I recommend this source for this dvd without reservations. If only all used dvd's would be like this one from this vendor. I am very pleased.
5,a royal movie,"Eddie Murphy has made many great movies (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places & The Distinguished Gentleman) but Coming to America is his very best. This movie is so funny and I never get tired of watching it!"
5,A super plus for Eddie and African Americans,Hard to believe I'm the only one who commented on this film. Its excellent. The Comedy is great. And it shows two sides of African American life in a very humorous way.The Prince of Africa [Eddie Murphy] has a pre-arranged bride but he wants to find his own queen. He goes to America to find a wife and does so but not without trails and tribulations=antics.One of the funniest scenes is when he goes into a bar to look for a wife. The interviews are gut busting funny! Arsenio Hall plays himself coming on to himself and Eddie Murphy.This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen.A must see film for any comedy lover.JEM
4,Hilarious & Entertaining,"Coming to America is Eddie Murphy at his best! The movie is entertaining from beginning to end. Although I have watched this movie over a dozen times, it still makes me laugh. I was thrilled when I saw the movie on blu ray and noticed the improvements with color and sound. One thing I enjoyed most about this movie is seeing Eddie and Arsenio play a variety of characters. Great movie to watch if you have friends over and you just want to have a great night with plenty of laughs."
4,Great movie,This is one of my favorite movies by Eddie Murphy I would recommend to everyone I know. Especially with all the characters he portraits in the movie thats the best part.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"The write up was good, the stars listed as Chris Williamson and Tret Fure (no where to be seen or heard) no content to speak of. I could have paid less and gone to a porno store for this. I would really like a good movie with dialog, and a story line not just a sex flick."
4,cheap batteries.. not a bad thing.,bought these to leave in my truck - I carry a few smaller flashlights with me that use the AA - haven't paid attention to how long they actually last - but they work for what I needed them for.
1,2 time failure,"Bought the 2175 for $99.00 CAD (after rebate) at Future Shop in Canada. After going through the set up the thing would not power on. I'd get a 'test-system' notice and then nothing. No matter how many times I retried, same thing. HP support says bring it back - it's defective hardware. Bring home my second one. All is nicely installed, but then run into the same problem reported by reviewer Bedfordx...grinding sound and message 'scanner failure'. Had to power off and on and try again...same thing... HP support tells me...bring it back, it's defective hardware problem...It's back for good...I then went with the Lexmark X6170...awesome machine with much better functionality...and it WORKS! ...joe in Canada"
1,"Horrible printer! You want frustration, buy this printer!","Horrible printer! You want frustration, buy this printer!I bought this printer last year. Since then, I only have frustration and more frustration trying to use this printer. HP offers one year warranty on this printer. I'd prefer not to have any warranty at all. I've contacted HP tech support and they keep sending (shipping) defective printer after defective printer to me. Not to mention countless hours on the phone trying to solve the problem.There's a GRINDING sound every time I turn on the printer. It says, align cartridge. The GRINDING sound continues until it says SCANNER failure.I've always used HP products, but after the experience with this printer, I'll think twice. The funny thing is, before buying this printer I came to this page to read the reviews. I liked it. Now I am stuck with this problem because I found the reviews helpful. What's going on? How come it works for you and not for me?HTH,a sincere reviewer!"
1,Cups leak,"Seemed pretty good at first. But on three occasions, the coffee would spilled all over the place while it was brewing. What would happen is that one cup would fill while the other was nearly empty.Then six months later (now) both cups began to leak on our shirts. The tops no longer sealed tight enough to prevent the coffee from dripping down our chins and onto our shirts. The company wouldn't replace the mugs. In fact they wanted to sell me new ones. No thanks."
5,"Quick ship, exactly what I ordered",They said fresh roasts.......very fresh roasts..my only problem was the mailman sniffing the package for the fresh coffee smell. I'll certainly buy from these guys again
4,Older Disney movies are the best,I always find the older disney movies--Lady and the tramp--ect to reflect a simpler and more robust outlook on life.
5,Such Sweet Puppy Love,"I love Lady and The Tramp! It is definetly my favorite Disney movie of all times! I love Lady. I always watch the movie with my cocker spaniel dog Sophie laying next to me. Its funny too because everytime the part with the dogs howling in the kennel, Sophie starts howling with them ha ha. I give this movie 5 stars! I'd give it more, but 5 was as high as it would go."
5,My favorite Disney movie by far,"I remember first seeing this movie in the theater in 1980 at the age of 6, and becoming so obsessed with it that I drew the characters endlessly (at one point when I was older I won an art contest and received a private tour of the Disney animation studio in Burbank, CA). I also remember the frustration I felt at how long it took Disney to release it to home video, which finally happened when I was a teenager. The story is lovely and the characters absolutely wonderful and memorable, the songs are not overdone and are a nice addition rather than a distraction, and overall this is a movie that adults can enjoy as much as children. The extras DVD with this edition is great with a lot of enjoyable material, especially about the history of the development and artwork of the movie. I highly recommend this edition for Disney lovers, animation lovers, and anyone who loves an engaging and charming story."
4,Not Worth Upgrading,"In comparing the DVD of this movie to the Blu-Ray, there is virtually no difference. The audio is the same. The colors are the same. And the details in the moving characters are the same.There is a slight difference in the details of the background, but not enough to justify upgrading from DVD to Blu-Ray.And I have found this to be the case of all hand-drawn animated movies. Of course, Pixar's computer-animated movies are a different story.However, if you do not as yet have the DVD, this Blu-Ray set is worth purchasing (but not at typically-high Disney prices). Lady and the Tramp certainly has one of best musical scores of all time."
1,Rubiish,"The DVD sent was in the Korean language, to disvcover this the seals had to be opened therefore not retunable."
3,Excellent Movie - Problem with DVD stopping,"It is an excellent movie complete with the booklet. My grand daughter loves it. Truly a classic & wonderful movie.The DVD sticks often & we have to wait for it to continue. I am not sure whether this is the fault of the DVD or our DVD player. However, we did watch a different movie without one skip yesterday."
5,Disney Continues Brilliant Remastering,"My family have been watching the lousy transfer 1st edition Lady & the Tramp DVD for over 10 years & I've been eagerly anticipating this Blu Ray release. It has been worth the wait.PROs:Classic Disney cartoon love story of two dogs from different sides of the tracksCauses me to refer to our fluffy beast as ""That dog!""Great songsScene of Lady & Tramp sharing spaghetti is one of the most memorable animated scenes of all timeOutstanding Blu Ray transfer & sound on par with other Disney releasesCONs:Disney as usual front-loads 20+ minutes of previews up front that must be skipped.NOTE: Avoid the direct to video sequel! Recommended for all families and Disney fans."
1,Ripped off,"Please be advised that the book grove sent me what they called a new dvd of lady and the tramp. When I receieved it, it was obviously used. Upon further inspection, I saw that the case was computer generated complete with type o's. In other words, this is bootlegged and passed off as new and sold for new. Buyer beware of this company."
2,WHY THE SPANISH DUBBING HAS BEEN CHANGED?,"This unforgettable movie of the Disney's factory is perfectly restored as for image and sound. But for those that we saw it when we were children in its spanish version, we have met with the surprise that, for this occasion, the dubbing to Spanish has been carried out again. Regrettable! The current actors that lend their voice to the movie, are very far from the quality of those Mexicans of the years 50's. Some words have even been changed, losing all its favour. Those beloved actors of 1955, put the soul in their diction. Those of now, they recite as if they are reading a book. In short, that for those that we had liked to hear it in same spanish of 50's, the movie has lost all its charm. Why Disney have had to change the original dubbing? On the other hand, in the VHS previous version, the Spanish version was the original of 1955."
3,Different Kids have different tastes. 5 thumbs sideways.,"I own every disney Kids movie ever made. This is one movie that the kids never want to watch or load into the motorhome when we leave town. Even my daughters have only seen it once. I still give it 3 stars because My wife and I love this movie. But given the over 100 movies we now own for FAMILY VIEWING the children just never select this one, or Dumbo or Bambi. If you are just starting to build your family faire movies, i recommend starting elsewhere first.Here are the ones they love: Pete's Dragon, Lion king, Beauty and the beast, Peter Pan. Also check out Princess Bride, Swan Princess, brave little toaster and Land Before Time."
5,An ultimate Disney gem. Highly recommended.,"Lady and the Tramp is a story about the adventures of Lady, a sweet and pampered Cocker Spaniel; and tramp, a footloose and collar-free mutt.I will give this movie more stars if I could! Adults will love the beautiful story filled with romance, and the movie has a very good soundtrack. The songs are enjoyable, especially 'Bella Notte' and 'He's A Tramp'.Kids will love the cute-looking dogs and will enjoy going along with the dogs' adventures.AND ALL AGES WILL ENJOY THE SPAGHETTI SCENE!"
4,good purchase,My daughter loved this as a little girl. Now have two granddaughters. Happy to purchase the same movie on DVD.
4,Lady and the tramp,I purchased this movie for my 2 1/2 yr old grandaughter.She liked it very much until the rat with red eyes showed up. She was happy after the dogs saved the baby.It is a sweet movie
1,How Does it Work?,"I bought the special edition DVD set and after sitting through 5 minutes of previews for films which must be making Walt turn over in his grave, I was greeted with....nothing. I could get as far as the government warnings about copy right infringement and then nothing...no picure, no sound, no main feature. I could hear the disc running, but no movie. After several attempts with that disc and one exchange later, I am currently without Lady and the Tramp. I have no problems with any other disc, except the newly released Howl's Moving Castle...also a Disney two disc special. I've encountered the same problem with that set. I am unable to actually access the movie itself, but the previews work fine. Is there something I'm not aware of????"
5,Entertaining look at Monopoly,"A documentary about a board game is not something I would typically think to go see, but I'm glad I saw this! This was a fun and very entertaining look at the game of monopoly. Through the overarching stories of real people preparing for a monopoly tournament, it covers the many ways in which the game has become a part of not only American pop culture, but many cultures around the world, the woman who invented the first version of the game, people's favorite tokens, and much more. Well done Mr. Tostado!"
3,Cute mystery theme!,The Chocolate Mouse Trap starts out slow but once you get to the middle it gets really interesting! She does a good job of slipping in small clues that mean something later. A good book to read on a cold windy night!
4,Light-weight cozy mystery with a chocolate theme,"This is my current ""treadmill series"". I look for engaging books that are available in large-print so I can easily read them while doing my early morning workout on the treadmill. Carl had me jumping out of bed to get on the treadmill each morning to see what would happen next in this delightful little story. This is not heavy reading by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun light-hearted story with a good plot. As with all the Chocoholic mysteries, the story is based around Lee and her Aunt Nettie who run a chocolate shop in the tourist town of Warner Pier, Michigan. In this story, Lee is a member of the ""Seventh Food Group""; a group of local merchants who have businesses related to events. The leader of their group is murdered and there is some connection to the emails she used to send out. Suddenly all the members of the group are in danger. And that is all I'm going to tell you!"
2,Extremely small,"This bear is tiny! I guess what do you expect at 10"", but it's seriously itty bitty. I picked up several for upcoming baby showers and it will be perfect for that, but I wouldn't expect much from this toy to be honest. I love Melissa & Doug stuff, but this looks rather cheaply made for them, and I'm glad I got it for a real steal when Amazon lowered the price. Had I paid ""retail"" of $12.99 or whatever they're asking, it would definitely be going back. Would not suggest purchasing this."
3,Much Smaller than I expected,"This bear is very soft and cute but it is much smaller than I had anticipated, I would definitely NOT spend more than two dollars on it."
2,Juvenile,"This movie disappointed me and the viewing public at large when it was released in theaters. Eddie Murphy is, if nothing else, a smart comedian and observer of people. What he's made here appears to be a movie he first dreamed up when he was 11 years old and heard about the history of Harlem. The problem is, it's got exactly that level of sophistication, too. It could, in fact, be very enjoyable for boys aged 10-13, given the crude humor, simple plot, and overly aggressive interaction of the characters. Nevertheless, I can't recommend it to parents because of the extreme profanity."
4,For anyone who begs to differ,"I dont understand how someone could watch this and not think that it was an instant classic. I was seven years old when this movie came out and didnt see it until I was 20, and it still ranks among one of the best comedies in my life as well as many other people!!"
4,Pretty shoe!,"This is a classy shoe and looks good with dressy clothes and slacks. As the other reviewers have noted, it is also comfortable."
2,Why?,"I should first explain that I like the Masters of Horror series. Granted, most of them are...not good, but one in a half-dozen is worth the time. Those of you who love this series, don't reject what I say about this episode just because it is negative.As for The Washingtonians, several years ago I read the short story upon which this episode is based. It was, flatly, one of the worst things I've ever read. It tried very hard to be creepy and funny at the same time, but in the end it was just a bad idea filtered through the expressive powers of a talentless (hack) writer.Now, as for the ""Why?"" in my title: Why, for the love of all that is good and right--why would they think that a movie based on a poorly conveived and poorly written short story could be anything other than unwatchable?"
3,"Doesn't Match the Short Story, But is a Fun Ride","Bentley Little's short story of the same title is a classic, original black humor-ish horror tale. I was stoked that they decided to bring this one to the screen, and did end up enjoying the film. The imagery was terrific, but the altered ending and lack of development kept it from taking the original tale to the next level.The gory scenes of cannibalism with eerie pale faced, powder-wigged Gentlemen going to town on the corpses were shot just right. The dialouge was decent and the acting was mediocre, rather forgettable, really save for the Washingtonians themselves who come off as creepy and feisty.Worth a look if you enjoy tongue in cheek horror flicks and have a twisted sense of humor."
2,Out of juice,Ordered these Maxell AAA batteries. Only wanted to 4 to power my Logitech harmony remote. Couldn't even find 4 out of the 10 that had enough juice to power my remote.
2,Boring and not very intellectually stimulating,"I had to purchase/read this text for a graduate sociolinguistics course and found the contents to be quite dull, as it contained no information with which I wasn't readily familiar (outside of some information about Canada that is neither relevant or interesting to my life). For what it's worth, it was well written. But, I would NEVER had read this text if not required."
5,Exceptional - A great Reference Book,I found this book just answered so many questions for me when I bought my kiln. The good news is that firing temperatures are shown in fahrenheit as well as celsius. It covered so many basic ideas on many topics yet it also contained information on more advanced techniques that I could explore. I particularly liked this book when it came to troubleshooting and find that I am using it like a reference book that I want to keep on hand. Beautifully illustrated - a top book!
3,There are better ones out there....It is ok,The DVD that I bought was missing about 25 minutes of the movie and the scenes were less than arousing on average!
3,The Great Dinosaurs Mystery Solved,"opposed to the evolutionist assumption that humans appeared on earth after two million years since Dinosaurs lived on earth, the author asserts that Dinosaurs and humans lived together. To prove his assertions he collected all the footprints of Dinosaurs on the fossils as well as the sculptures in the caves painted by the Indians and related indications. He concludes that both of them lived simultaneously on earth for a long while and that evolution did not arise at all in our world. In addition, the author insists that moral and ethics will be completely collapsed if the evolutionist theory permeates every area of our society.We are sure his asserttions are true to fact.CW."
3,A movie for kids,"It's OK but it's really meant for kids and I'm an adult so I got less out of it, but it did bring back old memories"
3,VERY overpriced,"a 4 pack of rayovac 1800mah (probably higher capacity sold now) AAs is $8.97 at walmart. if you get them mail order add 1.44 for shipping. 1800 mah is now the low end for AA nimh batteries, there are 2000, 2100 and 2200mah ones out now. I have bought 4 lenmar 2000s for $6! (wish I had stocked up during the sale)"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A pretty average collection of Herbert stories, here, with an average of only 3.25 compared to the 3.50 for the Priests of Psi, for example.Book of Frank Herbert : Seed Stock - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : The Nothing - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Rat Race - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Gambling Device - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Looking for Something? - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : The Gone Dogs - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Passage for Piano - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Encounter in a Lonely Place - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Operation Syndrome - Frank HerbertBook of Frank Herbert : Occupation Force - Frank HerbertColony talent deprivation.3.5 out of 5Mutant decline.3 out of 5Freak outbreak.3.5 out of 5No choice.3 out of 5Careless indoctrination.3 out of 5Canine virus wipeout research.4 out of 5Music bugs us.3.5 out of 5Predicting solitude.2.5 out of 5Music Scramble.3.5 out of 5Status reveal.3 out of 5"
4,"Works great, but not on a big screen tv (use a laptop!)","My cats didn't pay attention to it on our big screen tv, but when we played it on our laptop and the mice/gerbils/birds/etc. were more life-sized they were rapt with attention!"
3,It's just birds,"Maybe I didn't read the description right, but it's JUST birds on this edition. They are clear, but sometimes they focus on one too long and my cats get bored. I can get them to watch for 30 minutes, but by that time- I'm bored too!! The sound is excellent and each bird is named on the screen, so it's educational too!"
1,Horrible,this is one of the worst movies that Eddie Murphy has ever been associated with.it's a complete mess.you would have thought that with Dudley Moore&Eddie Murphy that this film would have been a must see? not even close.
3,At times Funny but Fans of Moore and Muprhy will love this.,"A Inpet Inventor (Dudley Moore) of a Malfunctioning Piece of Defense Equipment and a Man (Eddie Murphy). who has to deal with the Invention, who is actually in war in another Country.Directed by Williard Huyck (Howard the Duck) made a clever but uneven entertaining comedy. This could have been better if Moore and Murphy had at least One Scene together or More, could make this film more enjoyable. Still enjoyable film. Grade:B."
1,Leaks before expiration date.,Duracell AA batteries have a tendency corrode before the expiration date. I have not experienced this issue with other Duracell sizes. I do not recommend using Duracell AA in any emergency communications or lighting gear.
2,In spite of allmusic's review this is a really weak album,"Liking China Crisis has always been a secret pleasure for me. In many ways they tread a thin line between ingenious soul makers and tepid adult contemporary. This album crosses the line into the tepid. If you were able to find something wonderful under the saxophone cliches of ""What Price Paradise"" then you understand what I mean. This not that album and even though I have searched many times I can't find that sparkle that keeps this album from being just awful."
1,dull and uninteresting,"This book skipped all of the interesting things I was looking forward too in a New York book. You'd be better to invest in a travel guide of the city. There was so much opportunity to make this book come alive with faction feuds, garou tie ins (did they forget they already published a new york book? 'Rage across New York"") or maybe even an interesting character of two."
2,Dont get it,i personaly did a better job passing the game by my self than with the help of this book
4,Useful knowledge for Executives,"This friendly and useful book is a must for those wanting to understand the financial aspects of business. It is well organized and very accessible. My business partner and I welcomed the practical approach taken by the authors. We found the contents immediately useable in our Internet business which is based on our research at Harvard University. This book creates a solid foundation upon which to build deeper understanding of the financial world. We recommend it highly, it is on our reference shelf and should be on yours."
3,Bought as a gift,I gave this as a gift and I wasn't given any negative feedback so I assume it was at least OK.
3,DVD Special features lacking,"I loved this movie from my first viewing in its original release. So when it became available on DVD I immediately ordered it with the hope of obtaining insight. However, director Brooks and his cohorts running commentary leave much to be desired. One gets the impression from their babbling that they haven't seen the flick in fifteen years plus. Compared to the excellence of director Chris Columbus commentary on Mrs. Doubfire, Terms is sorely lacking. I am disappointed."
3,"Great, but lacking","I bought this CD because I am a fan of Steppenwolf, and I wanted a CD with just their best songs on it; this gave it to me. No more, no less. I found it disappointing that it doesn't have the entire song of any of the songs, it just does that annoying fade out when it's getting close to the end. But for [money], hey what can you expect? Buy it."
2,Steppenwolf: Greatest Hits,"Buyer beware.In a word, ""boring"".Another word, ""tedious""First two cuts great classic rock anthems, slightly overplayed but who could ever shut down their ears when Magic Carpet Ride surfaces? And who wouldn't envision themselves with a Hog between their legs and bugs are smacking their face when Born To Be Wild is wafting in the etheral airwaves?After that, not a lot of energy or enthusaism and the ten cuts seemed to take forever to wade through back to the first two power cuts. Not much more to say, other then this disc really felt as yet another attempt to squeeze as much remaining droplets of quality out of an already depleted repetoire.If this disc isn't free refrain from wasting your time because this journey has two flats and is stuck in the ditch of life."
5,The best,"I love this compilation of his best - listen to it often. The music still makes me rock, especially born to be Wild."
2,Overly careful & outdated scholarship; good for the beginner,"A collection of essays on the ancient world, from Minoan Crete to the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity. Finley is a careful writer and an even more careful scholar; he doesn't make rash conclusions about points of historical controversy. And there's much solid historical fact to learn in this slim collection: about slaves and freemen and the status of women in Rome, Plato and democracy in Athens, Diocletian the autocrat, and so on. However, there are obviously good reasons not to read a book whose scholarship is thirty-five old (26, where it was revised in 1977). And then, Finley is often simply too careful not to make pronouncements: many chapters end on questions, such as why cynicism as a philosophy became popular, or how Crete was related to classical Greek culture, without any answers. Not too satisfying."
4,great blues-rock,"Johnny's playing is excellent.Excellent tone,smooth fluid playing.Some sf the tunes seem to go on too long and wear out their welcome at the half-way point.Johnny seems frustrated that the audience is not fully embracing his return to blues after being a rock and roll guitar god throughout the seventies.All in all,a worthy performance."
4,Good but not the best!,"I like the small albums of big groups befor they make it big more that the big albums that they put out after, but I do not think that this is SOUNDGARDEN's best work! I do not like to go with the big ones but I thik that SUPERUNKNOWN is beter then this. A album came out the same year that this one did that I like beter then this one a the album was called ""BLEACH"" by NIRVANA! Hey I know what to do I'm gonna.............you ....you Ya I know what to do I'm gonna............you ....you Whit Lyrics like that, This album has to be a good one."
5,Outstanding explanation on water chemicals,"Book covers details on water cycle, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chlorine, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, nitrogen cycle, pH, hardness & salinity, temperature, various filtrations, maintenance, and plants. It covers briefly on all other aspects of aquarium and fish, but the author does it well in a clear, concise manner. Lots of pictures and graphs. The book is packed with wealth of information in just 80 pages!"
3,Decent,"The fifth slot for bike is very hard to put the bike on. The rack is somewhat wobbly in my 2"" hitch. I bought it with understanding that it would not wobble. Everything else is fine."
4,Would George Orwell have written a happy ending?,"Although I enjoyed much of what Mr. Orwell said in this movie, i.e., the fight between the artist and philistines, I think him ending up in the suburbs with the aphisdistra is out of line, but then of course, he had Ms. Bonham-Carter. That should ease some of the pain."
4,Delightfully witty and charming!,"Richard E. Grant is hysterical, Bonham Carter, his devoted girlfriend is wise and middle class which is where they part and then re-unite. Both are employed (between the world wars) as copywriter and graphic artist for a London advertising agency. Grant, believing he has a future as a poet, ""quits"" his day job for a life of ""art."" Downward he spirals, embraces a bohemian lifestyle, embracing his freedom. Alas, middle class responsibilities, sexual tension and love for another ultimately balance their lives. Very funny, intelligent, and downright enjoyable. Any Anglophile will enjoy!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I've read many of Ursula Hegi's books. This was by far, the worst. It just seemed to have no point to it and I didn't like the characters. After reading two-thirds of the book, I just couldn't stand it anymore and put it aside for another book.Her best book: Salt Dancers"
4,Not an extreme amount of plot.,"We've all read the sort of book which is all plot, but has no character developement; Hegi's book is the opposite sort. Not to say that it has no plot, but it is mainly a lengthly meditation on character."
2,Disappointing,"I absolutely loved ""Stones From the River"" but am having trouble getting through this book. I keep hoping it will get better but am having my doubts."
5,A music fan from Norway,"I like a lots of music, and The Katinas is one of the best group I ever have heard. So if you are one that not have bought this album, you have to visit a musicstore and buy it!"
3,Cheap Functional a/v Switch,"The switch is very light and cheap. Feels like a 100% mechanical operation, no electronics. The click it makes when a button is pressed is rather loud. But the bottom line, I've used this switch for about 1 month and not had a single problem, Straight forward installation. Note: If you plan to use the s-video, your t.v might not display any other inputs which use standard A/V jacks with the s-video cord connected between the switch and the t.v."
3,Works but not long past the warranty,"This item worked great when it was new, but after leaving it set for a long time on 1 position that set of inputs became useless. No warning to this effect is in the instructions."
4,"Good switch, cheap price","This is a good, cheap mechanical video switch. I use it to switch between my satellite dish receiver, PlayStation 2 and XBox, all using S-video. I tried connecting a VCR that only had RCA outputs, but having both the S-video and RCA video connected to my TV's input caused a strange diamond pattern to appear. When only the S-video or only the RCA video were connected, the pattern disappeared and I had great quality video.So, if you need to connect multiple sources, be sure to use only one type of video connection. Of course, you can always manually connect the desired video connection to your TV's input when needed, but then why bother purchasing a switch? You'd be better off purchasing two of these: one for S-video sources and one for RCA video sources."
4,"Good set, cookies were mostly recognizable","The big problem with cookie-cutters is that the cookies don't always come out looking like the cutter. This was of course true to some extent here, but mostly you could tell what they were."
2,Stiff Dialogue and Fatuous Set-Up Sink the Film,"Perhaps one of the most implausible set-ups I've ever seen in a film: An intelligent, attractive secretary played by Lauren Bacall becomes, inexplicably, drawn to an unctuous, rich playboy with absolutely no appeal, played by Robert Stack. The Stack character is so transparent in his moral banktruptcy that it is inconceivable that the Bacall character, with hardly any prodding, falls in love and marries him. Beyond this quick, desperate marriage which contradicts the apparent cool-headedness of Bacall, the film collapses under its stiff, laughable dialogue, so that the film is slow and plodding."
2,Numerous Problems Right Out of Box,"This product had a number of problems: (1)When playing a disc with 4 TV program episodes, sometimes it would work fine and other times it would not let me select a program. (2) After playing an MP3 disc (which played fine), I tried to watch a movie and while the video was fine, the audio would not play. After shutting down and starting back up 5 times, the disc played fine. (3) The unit would not hold the correct time. After setting it multiple times the results were always the same--as soon as I turned the unit off the time jumped exactly 3 hours into the future. Amazon was great and agreed to take it back. I already ordered a Panasonic from Amazon and will be shipping the RCA back this weekend."
1,Junk,"Did not work. Hooked it up and neither TV set would work. Disconnect either one, and the other one would work. Spent a LOT of time trying to get it to work. Don't buy this."
2,"Not 100%, Same problems as everyone else.",Can't get Video and audio on both outputs. It does something to the second output and I either don't get a picture or no sound.
1,hdmi splitter worthless,don't buy. Not powered so won't carry signal to tv. Completely useless & maker surely knows it. Amazon should not allow them to sell it.
2,Doesn't work right,I wanted to watch 2 tvs off the one cable box. Or just run the second HDMI cable from the living room to the bedroom. It screws up my inputs & I have to reset everything if I plug both cables in. O well
2,Diappointed,I was very disappointed in this item I tried to hook up a television and a dvr to the splitter and it would work properly
2,Can I use this to get source from two devices and output to TV?,"Based on the product description and reviews, it looks like, it takes one input (say from TV) and displays on two monitors. I am wondering can I use it in a reverse way like get source from Cable and DVD (one at a time) and display on TV. Will there be any signal loss? Do I need to go for a HDMI Switch?Thanks,"
3,"Splits Video, not Audio","This splitter works well if all you want to split is the video portion of the HDMI signal. If you want the audio as well, skip it, it does not do it."
1,Does not work,I made a mistake by not reading the customer reviews before buying this item. The many reviews which say that THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK are correct. I split a signal from a DVD player to two televisions. Only one of them would reliably display a picture. I bought a powered splitter and now both television displays work. Don't try to save money by buying this product because it costs less than a powered splitter. You'll just end up buying a powered splitter later.
5,I've waited a lifetime for this CD...and it was worth it.,"This is a fabulous recording. Two pioneers sharing the same stage and studio. The arrangements are brillant. If you enjoyed Pat's collaboration with Charile Hayden ""Beyond the Missori Sky,"" you will also enjoy this CD. While the mood is different on this recording, the playing is equally beautiful and haunting."
2,"Too much ""background""","The cover promises much and there is potential for much, considering the artists. Unfortunately, too much orchestra and ""accompaniment(?)"" hides too much of the beautiful, subtle guitar music. This is and ""OK"" album, but only just minimally so. <sigh>"
2,Great Movie. Terrible DVD,"Once again, a DVD producer has chosen to release a substandard product. Add ""Pioneer"" to the list of DVDs I will not buy. This is a VERY POOR reproduction. Some of the artifacts detract from the movie in a very strong manner. For example, the entire DVD is full of moire patterns and bad compression artifacts. Some of the aliasing and moire is so distracting that it causes ones eyes to be drawn inescapably to them. I will never buy another DVD until I have had an opportunity to view the production quality first. This is a very shoddy way for the DVD producers to treat their audience. To pay more for a DVD and then have it contain less quality than a VHS tape is, in my mind, criminal.The actual movie (story, acting, directing) is pretty good and I would give this 4 stars, but the media quality is so bad I just don't know what to do."
5,La Femme Nikita,"Besson's flashy ""Nikita"" was a huge hit for the French director in 1990, inspiring several remakes and even a TV series. But those versions lacked an essential component of the original's success: the feral, leggy, crazy/cool/beautiful Parrilaud, Besson's then-wife. (He even landed the great Jeanne Moreau, who cameos as Nikita's femininity coach.) Combining elements of the Pygmalion story with vivid visuals, high-fashion costumes and sets, and the cold brutality of classic noir, Besson concocted a female-driven action formula that continues to influence movies today. For fun, fast-driving entertainment, ""Nikita"" fires on all cylinders."
2,Pretty Woman with guns.,"This film is quite ridiculous. If it were American-made it would be categorized as an absurd B-movie action flick, since it's French we must pretend that it's some magnificent triumph of film. It isn't. Bad acting and an absurd storyline that does not flow well at all. I mildly enjoyed the movie for some inexplicable reason, but it's definitely not a must-see. Take it or leave it."
2,Over rated,"Too much over rated,the first 1 hour of the movie seemed to be like a year due to very very boring conversations, plus some loss ends and unclear vision for example no reall follow up on how the life of NIKITA changed during the training. Just cuts of the pictuers.I did nto like itDO NOT BUY IT"
4,THE POWER OF LOVE,"I found reading about Catherine's regressions and about the wise and wonderful things told to her by the Masters very fascinating. The author relays those messages to the reader in a very inspiring and touching way.The author mentions that his book is about many topics one of those being relationships. I am reminded of a GREAT BOOK called ""Working On Yourselves Doesn't Work"" by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book has become a very valuable tool for my own self discovery that has enabled me and many other people, to create REWARDING, ENRICHING AND LOVING LIVES.I also highly recommend the Kanes' audio tape called MAGICAL RELATIONSHIPS."
5,Excellent Commentary,"In my opinion, easily the best commentary available to students of the Bible out in the open market. A must-have for any seminary student or doctoral student. Word Biblical is well-respected among critical scholarship, and come highly recommended by me."
5,great reading/great author,"this was one of the best audio books i have ever read, but then heartsong does it up right. enjoyed it immensely"
5,"The Gufs ""Holiday From You""-An excellent buy!","This is the latest CD from Milwaukee's Own, The Gufs. The Band has been a favorite on the Milwaukee music scene for years and it is great to have this new release from Atlantic Records Lava label. This CD is full of 12 of the best songs that the band has ever recorded. If you like Matchbox20, Goo Goo Dolls, or Gin Blossoms, you will adore this CD! I would also recommend picking up any of The Gufs earlier releases to see how great they were back then, and how TERRIFIC they are now.Sign up for The Gufs mailing list @ gufs13@yahoo.com"
5,The Gufs Rock,I have loved the Gufs for a long time and this CD is the best...i have gotten a lot of my friends to listen to this cd...everyone of them have become gufs lovers...what can i say the gufs are just amazing...Gorans voice is easy to pick out even if someone hasnt heard the song....if they know the gufs they will know its goran....If u dont have this cd i would say u better get to the closest store and buy it...its worth the money....
2,"Occasionally humorous, but not much more","""Pittsburgh"" has its moments (the initial audition scene with Jeff Goldblum, a few others). The problem is, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean raised the bar so high on artistic mockumentaries (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Spinal Tap"", ""A Mighty Wind"") that one is too often aware of what's missing in this effort, namely a sense of true absurdity bubbling underneath the faux seriousness of it all. The concept is good, but not enough genuinely funny moments to make ""Pittsburgh"" something I'd recommend."
2,Average - just average,"I wanted to like this film - I like Jeff Goldblum and I grew up in Pittsburgh, so I thought it would be a win-win. But I just couldn't get interested. It started off with a yawn and simply didn't pick up speed. Sorry."
3,"Contains Many CCR songs, all but one, some music not exact","This is an OK book. It has most of the old CCR songs, it has all but about one. There are piano, vocal, and guitar chords here, but some of the songs printed aren't the CCR version. It really messed up ""Cotton Fields."" The songs are farily easy to play by an amatur pianist and/or amatur guitarist."
4,impressed,"Seeing ""Higgins Clark"" on the cover I accidently picked this up thinking it was her former mother-in law. Being an avid Mary Higgins Clark reader I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this book. I found it as good, if not better, than some of the more recent elder Clark's books. A fresh new edge for ""clean"" mystery readers."
5,Will Keep You Guessing,"I loved this book...it keeps you guessing to the very end. You don't have to be familiar with Ocean Grove NJ to be drawn in...but, I have to say, that being familiar with Ocean Grove certainly enhanced my reading experience. A great summer mystery no matter you set up your chair and umbrella!"
3,"Cute movie, actually a decent family movie!","Hello,after buying this tape for my sister, ( a great lover of doxies), I decided to watch it with my three children. It's very very cute and lighthearted, with ZERO profanity, and a sweet storyline. I recommend this film to any animal lover, but I also think it's great for children to view and enjoy"
2,The Ugly Dachshund (1966),Read good previous reviews by Amazon customers. But sorely disappointed. Too much bickering over the dogs by the hubby & wifey - I mean it was throughout the entire movie ! ug Wish now I would have watched it on Amazon demand B4 I bought it.
5,The Ugly Dachshund,This is one of the best movies for children that I have seen. It keeps moving so you don't get bored. And is very funny. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh. Watch it and enjoy!!
5,Great older movie.,"I remember watching this when I was a kid (I was a kid in the 80s) and loving it. Finally got a chance to see it again now that I'm older (and have my own dachshund) and still thoroughly enjoyed it. Sure, one could argue it is a bit dated, but it's a not very well known little gem from Disney that I think is still enjoyable. Kids will like it and adults will enjoy it as well."
2,Fun but not for dogs,"Fun to ride but any well spirited dog (specially terriers) wil bite and run inmediatly with the mouse, finishing the game in 3 seconds or less."
1,waste of time and money,"difficult to open, difficult to follow instructions, I couldn't get it to work. very disappointed"
5,A true believer in Christ,"This child of God is so blessed. She testifies and evangelizes through song. One day coming home from work, I was listening to my walkman and heard the song, ""God Can and God Will"". Well, my feet started moving a little faster and the Holy Spirit came upon me and ministered to me that God can fix it and I mean fix anything. ""PRAISE HIS HOLY AND WONDERFUL NAME"". You know when the Lord is ministering to someone and God Almighty is surely ministering to and through Dottie Poeples, it comes out of her music. This is another soldier in the ARMY OF THE LORD."
4,Betrayed Trust,"Mr. Akashi's ""Betrayed Trust"" is a must read for all students of World War II internment history. It presents a particularly vivid account of the internee conflicts and politics brought on at Tulelake Segregation Center by the government's ill-conceived and tragic renunciation program. Mr. Akashi's own family internment story is skillfully woven into the larger history of those Tulelake politics.John Christgau""ENEMIES: World War II Alien Internment"""
2,smarmy,"I hate to think of the trees felled for these ""popular"" exploitations. If you aren't learning to read music as you learn to play your instrument, you've got the wrong primer and the wrong teacher. In any case, a good non-instrumental treatment of this subject for beginners can be found in ""The ABC of Music: A Short Practical Guide to the Basics"" by Imogen Holst (daughter of the famous composer Gustav Holst). To learn how to write down music--a different thing than learning how to read music--see ""The Norton Manual of Music Notation"" by George Heussenstamm."
5,Amazing,"You can't be without this book if you have 3-6 year old kids. My girls can't get enough of it. The message is one of encouragement, persistence, and self confidence. Eric Drachman is amazing at what he does. The CD character voices seal the deal. A must have along with all the others: Ellison the Elephant and It's Me. A Frog Thing is his newest release and is maybe more appropriate for slightly older kids i.e. 5 and up."
2,Squeeze with Writer's Block?,"As a die-hard Squeeze fan, I must advise others that, in my opinion, this is their weakest offering. Holding perhaps two listenable pop tunes (""If It's Love"" and ""She Doesn't Have to Shave"") the rest is best described as medicocre filler. Both albums that came afterward (""Play"" amd ""Some Fantastic Place"") are FAR superior and highly recommended."
5,Golden Oldie from Oz,"Good script. good actors / actresses. Fabulous scenery.A real Ausie gem. The comparison of Deborah Kerr in this and then The King & I, is quite the opposite. Robert Mitchum & Glynis Johns add to this exceptional movie."
2,Too Long and Boring,"""The Sundowners"" is a long family saga set in the 1920's in a sprawling Australian sheep farming area. The acting is great and the casting fits well with the characters of Robert Mitchum, Deborah Kehr, Peter Ustinov and Glynis Johns. Mitchum and Kehr play the parents of a teen-age son that is tired of being a nomad. He wants a stable home and a farm for the family. He is tired of being a Sundowner. ""Sundowner"" refers to people like them that call a spot home when they pitch a tent as the sun goes down.The movie is in color, made in 1960, and long saga of a Australian family and how they make a living helping sheep farmers during their busy season. The movie is over two hours long and somewhat boring. There are some interesting landscape scenes that included kangaroos, koala bears, ostriches and Kookaburra birds. Other than that it reminded me of an American Western."
4,Exactly as it appears,"Got it fast delivery as usual. Medium was a perfect size for my small frame and growing belly. I tend to use it a lot while getting ready, walking around the house and nursing at home."
5,AN AWESOME ITEM FOR DUFF FANS,"I ordered this item because i'm a huge hilary duff fan, an i'm from mexico and we don't get really speciall things of duff over here, so i decided to order this a couple of weeks ago, the cd arived like a day a go and i was so amazed,because it is really cool i love it, it is a must have for all the duff fans, the cd comes with a bonus track, and with the dvd ""learning to fly"""
5,New captain on board,"Great new series show new and even better sets with the old stars, new and shifted plot, way better than Star Trek"
3,Completing the set,"Love Babylon 5, and the order came from Amazon promptly and with no problems. I only ordered this season though because it was on sale, since it is by far my least favorite of all the seasons. J. Michael is good at writing grand space opera, not so much political intrigue and spy craft. I felt the psychic war plotline was hit and miss, and just never made me really have empathy for them, as they didn't act all that bright, in my opinion. I couldn't figure out why Lyta never just said ""You want me to hep and use my powers, pony up some coin oh people who get paid through station trade taxes."" In the end though, as a fan, you can't not have the last season of Londo and G'Kar, who are both great, but especially Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar."
3,A dismal season with a few strong points,The season would have been great without the psi-corp part. Lyta has always been one of the weekest characters of the show so putting her in a more central role made the plot drag. Byron wasn't too hot either.The redeeming part of the season was the Centari War. I was literary on the edge of my seat reminding me that this was the greatest of all sci-fi out there.
3,A let down after season 4.,"This is pretty much just a wrapup of the series. Some imporant stuff happens, but it's not nearly the big deal of the first. There were good bits, but I really can't recall any right off the top of my head, while I could name at least a few from other seasons.Unfortunately, the end episode was so boring I couldn't get all the way through. Just so much of the nostalgic ""We're leaving this station we worked on."" stuff. It may just be me, but I can't stand that type of episode, though most shows do it when they end and many people like them.If you're an avid fan of the series and want to have the whole set, then go for it, but otherwise for the causal viewer I'd recommend seasons 2-4 as buys, 1 & 5 maybe rent or something."
4,Say Goodby,"As the last season of a great series, it was good. Not as good as the other seasons, but I'll have to hand it to them for not going too far out on the in a last statement. As the title Babylon 5 quietly stated, 5 seasons and out."
3,there is trouble with always winning your wars,"When this series was on, it was my favorite.Again in this season they win all their battles,but evil still has a way of still existing.If we externalize evil and try to kill it,the result may seem positive, but thealcoholism in one fellow comes out,and the Shadows of the Shadows emerge as well?Psi corps still goes on enslaving telepathsand Earth still wants Mars back.We will miss these fabulous customs and the space animationsof ships and war in space.The whole long series was well done and enjoyable."
5,This knife is fantastic..And i figured out the sheath..Read to learn,This knife is a fantastic deal..For a hair over 20 bucks are you kidding me..Totally solid..Will last for a long time..Grip is great..Just a nice Blade...As far as the sheath goes at first i must say i agreed with the bad reviews...Until i slowed down a bit an figured out how to use it...On the blade side of the sheath were the handle of the knife meets the sheath theres an opening were the sheath splits..If you push your thumb between that opening an push towards the tip of the blade the sheath will pop off effortlessly ..Give it a try...After i found this out i love the sheath as much as the knife almost ..4 star sheath 5 star knife..Awsome buy...thanks..
5,S&W HRT Tactical Knife,"Great knife...I just wish that S&W would have made it in the USA...an Iconic American Brand that is now also made in China. What is next, Apple Pie?"
3,not very impressed,this knife isnt bad came fairly sharp has a thick sturdy blade but isnt a great cutting or chopping tool this is designed more for penetration so if your looking for a self defense knife this one is great not to big not to small great carrying system and strong drop point. sheath is very well made and clip is strong yet slips on and off easily the handle is way to fat and round its not very ergonomic. if your looking for a good everyday carry with good cutting abilitys this isnt it this is a self defense blade and thats about it.
2,A knife is of no use if.....,"I will just echo much of what ""The Shepard"" said about the knife. It's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself. And to make a strange situation even more strange, the belt/boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location.....which is why I no longer own this knife. Rideing my motorcycle today, the knife fell away somewhere on I40. I don't miss it....Lynn Stubblefield"
4,Great Little Knife,"When I received this knife, it was very tight in the sheath (as other reviewers have noted) but there is a simple solution. Grab the handle and slightly twist counterclockwise as you pull, the knife will slide out of the sheath easily.The kydex sheath is not the greatest, the molded clip isn't removeable and I certainly wouldn't trust it attached to a boot, but the knife itself is an absolute bargain at this price. The handle is comfortable, the thick blade will take a shaving sharp edge and it's reasonably lightweight. Overall, a great little slicer to have in your backpack."
4,"Nice, convenient product","This interchangeable ball system offers a lot of convenience for folks who need to deal with a variety of towing situations where the ball size changes. That was my intention in buying it...to provide that utility with a 3-Point hitch attachement for my utility tractor so that the ball was always centered on the attachement while I moved my trailers around on the property. (the OEM method for my attachment was multiple balls in different holes which affects balance since none were centered) My utility trailer uses a 2"" ball, my horse trailer uses a 2 5/16"" ball and a friend's log splitter uses a 1 7/8"" ball. Unfortunately, the mounting holes in my 3-Pt hitch attachement are too small for this system's shank size, so I had to return the item. That said, I was impressed with the quality and would certainly recommend it for folks to consider should they want a reasonably priced interchangeable ball system."
4,Desired and wanted,"With the final DVD, I was able to catch up my old favorites of this cult classic. Too bad this show was cancelled nevertheless it set the tone for others to follow."
4,Had to Complete my Collection....,"And was beyond tickled that this was available! Towards the last season of Forever Knight, I kept missing episodes because of it showing at odd times and the like, so it was an absolute thrill that is available this way. My one complaint is that there was no commentary from Geraint or Nigel - that kind of sucked. But overall, if you loved the tale of an 800 year old vampire trying to become human again, this completes his saga."
2,"Nice looking, not terribly resilient","I bought two of these for next to the bed. First off they're a little large for that, but I'm not deducting stars for that because I should have taken a tape measure out so it's my fault. Why I don't like these lamps is within weeks:- One of the lamp shades unglued itself. Now it hangs down on three of the four sides, barely attached. I tried re-gluing but I'm terrible at that stuff, and frankly I don't buy things so I can practice my arts and crafts. I get around this by propping the shade against the wall- The same lamp is a pain to turn on and off. You twist the knob and instead of clicking it feels like the housing inside is turning with the knob. Eventually you can get it, but again, this happened within weeks of purchaseThe second lamp is fine, but I'm disappointed in this purchase. Without these problems I'd say 4 stars."
2,Brooks' brush strokes are too broad,"Thoughtful and deep but make a few too many generalizations. I don't know too many of these upper class twits as it turns out. Still, there are some observations about Bobo consumptive patterns that utterly ring true, in my experience."
3,Insightful but thin,"Brooks points out how post-Boomers grasp counterculture values and thus have formed a conservative movement with liberal trappings. If you read between the lines, you see an updated version of an old adage, which is ""Money corrupts, and absolute money corrupts absolutely."" The book is thin because after the first forty pages, the ratio of content to jokes, banter, and anecdote goes shooting downward and thus while it's an easier read it becomes boring because it has no fact or discovery of greater plotline available to it. I liked this book because he points out how any group can become entrenched in its privileged position, but found it thin as mentioned, and am skeptical about his glib assurance that these people can somehow manage our future."
4,You don't have to read it all to get the point...,"If you are looking for a fun book, easy reading, and even not to feel obligated to read all the sections, well this is one. Brooks describes very sharlpy the changes that have and still are facing the different crowds of the society in the United States.It shows you the fakeness in their behavior, how so much is done just because it is the cool thing to do, not what they really like doing. How the country have changed in the last years, and how the values have just disappeared even at the daily level.Some examples are really funny, they are so true though they make you wonder even more about the foundations people are trying to accomplish.I guess less knowledge, and more superficiliaty made it work up to now. Eliminate the intellectual group and everything will be just fine.Read it, and wonder how the heck did all this happen.."
4,Bobos all over the world as well as in Paradise,"Mr. Brooks has produced a wonderful and deep social and psycological analysis of an elite class whose way of living and upscale culture is sorrounding us all over the world, not only in America. He shows, without mercy, the tasty trends of the upper classes during the 90s and how these trends influence us all in terms of consumption, marketing and even politics.A fun to read book where Mr. Brooks developed an accute and smart critic over our generation."
4,A good audio book,"I really enjoyed listening to this in my car during long commutes. It reads well out loud - rather like an exceptional talk show or interview. Whether you find the author's viewpoint entertaining or maddening, it makes the drive time pass more quickly."
1,Misguided,"One hates to be a snob, but the author seems to know very little about the true upper class. The people about whom he writes are largely middle class--upper middle class, perhaps, but ""middle"" nonetheless. For better or worse, I would argue that the ""bobos"" are not, in fact, running the country, either. He gives them far too much credit in terms of their supposed ""power."" And George W. a bobo? Hardly. He's as elite and old money as they come; it's just that he has a Texas twang! I also would argue that the group about which he writes is nothing new. The nouveau riche will always be with us, and they will always be a group of show-off super-consumers who are slightly ill at ease as they try to reconcile newfound wealth vs. humbler, occasionally bohemian roots."
2,Strangers in Paradise,"I saw this book in my library and thought it would be a fun read for a rainy afternoon. I was very disappointed. The author is trying too hard to be clever and funny and he isn't.I didn't find it very amusing as I'm surrounded by these vapid creatures. In the past few years the area where I live has become ""in"" and they have arrived in their SUVs and with bad manners to clutter up our quiet spot with their McMansions. They are shallow and boring, but a source of amusement to watch playing country. They'll never get it and we won't tell them.Years ago I laughed out loud while reading the Preppy Handbook and expected this book would be like that. It isn't. Don't waste your time on this."
1,Sitram cooker is poorly designed,This cookers top is easily misaligned when putting it on the pot. It resulted in a jam that caused the handles to break when trying to remove the jammed top. It is a useless brand new item that I had to discard without using.
5,nazareth sounding,this is great rock music from a band that never made it .They sound a lot like nazareth and are very good.The songs are well written and well played.If you like nazareth iam sure you like gun.I hope this review was helpfull
4,Spartacus---Review that is brief and to the point,"This book is much better (in my estimation) that Spartacus by Lewis Grassic Gibbon. To begin with, it is eminently more readable. When I tried to power my way through Gibbon's Spartacus I couldn't but help daydream and fall asleep because the writing style was so archaic and required close attention. Howard Fast's book is filled with drama and character development that greatly enhances the story with which most people are familiar. While other books tend to die out near the end, I found Spartacus to actually become most entertaining in the final 65 pages."
1,charge too much,"i went into a chinese grocery store, they charge the same product for $15 a bottle, while this vendor charged me $50 a bottle."
4,The ultimate competitor,"Great read for any surf fan. kelly is a sharp guy from humble beginnings who is very modest and very, very talented athletically. Now if only Laird would write a book. Only Tom Curren would be more interesting."
4,Good but light on details,"Yet another good basic book for managing software projects. Should be required reading for first time software managers, and again when they are promoted once more. By then if they haven't got these techniques down, they should go back to development.It's a good compilment to the patterns of ""failed project"" etc. at the pattern language web page.BTW what is often called ""Radical"" is only applying what should have been known at the time, and is now considered common practice. (Which is also an oxymoron as common practice often isn't.)"
3,What kind of Blackwood fan are you?,"Whether you enjoy this work may depend on which Blackwood genre you prefer: ghost story or nature fiction. If you prefer the latter, you may find this book a gem. If not, you may find it lugubrious, as I do."
5,SiliconZone 9 by 12 inch small baking mat,"Great product. This thin mat will allow for bottom browning on pizza which is what we use it on. The run off cheese never sticks, just slide it off on a cutting board and serve. It washes in the dishwasher and is very care free. I have another brand that is too thick and does not allow the crust to brown on the botton and worst it is soggy. Get the SiliconZone!"
2,Dosn't clean up even in dishwasher,"This liner is non-slip which is nice and even home made chocolate chip cookies dont stick BUT....it looks dirty and baking residue is sticking to it even after I have put it in the dishwasher. My other liner is a Chef's Planet Full size baking sheet non stick bakeliner and while it can slip a bit and dosn't have a ""finished"" edge it dose have the advantage of wipe-down clean up and it arrives in a large sheet that you custom cut to fit any baking sheet(s) you will be using it with. Don't buy this liner but do buy the non stick bakeliner from Chef's Planet. It's not as pretty but it works like a charm! After years of buying expensive parchment paper I'll never go back. Also, it's less wastfull to use a bake liner instead of disposable baking sheets or parchment paper."
3,Complete confusion on this page....,"My rating is completely arbitrary and included only so I can post this remark, for reasons explained below: in short, that this page is hopelessly combining two different works.Okay, there was a 1990 Hong Kong movie with the title ""Xiao ao jiang hu""; the English title was Swordsman; it was based on a Louis Cha novel; it spawned two sequels. There appears to have been a 2000 TV series also called ""Xiao ao jiang hu,"" based on the same novel. If the IMDB is to be trusted, the English title (in Singapore, at least) is ""The Legendary Swordsman."" Okay: Two different adaptations of the same book.The cover picture, price, and date in the title suggest that this is the TV series; but the list of directors and stars suggests that this is the 1990 film. The various comments and reviews are mostly about the 1990 film. Something has gone terribly wrong here."
3,Nice little pan,"Well-made pan in the DeMeyer line. Only complaint is that the pour spout is not 100% efficient - hence the 3 stars versus 5. Works OK when pouring - spills down the side. But it's a decent little pan for melting butter, etc."
3,"entertaining, informative..left me hungering for more...","Okay, my title isn't exactly accurate, but I just had to go for the lowbrow humor. Honestly, though, the book was entertaining at first, and was also fairly informative: it did actually answer most of the morbid questions I had about cannibalism. But I found the book a bit lacking for a couple of different reasons. First, the humor got on my nerves after a while. It's essentially one joke: ""I like eating people."" Second, the real information (history, facts about cannibalism, etc.) kinda stops 2/3 of the way through the book, and is replaced with more ""humor"" like recipes and such. Anyway, think of the book as ""Cannibalism for Dummies"" and you won't go too wrong..."
4,great stuff,"When I watch this video, I get flashbacks of my life during that time. The tape features Tom Hanks when he was just another actor in silly movies, PeeWee Herman, Penn and Teller, and the president's son (no, not Dubya!).Cameos of audience members, a ""Back to the Future"" spoof, a yuppie-slamming commercial parody, a Hall and Oates impersonation, etc., all show that 1985 was (and is) the most totally ""eighties"" year.My only complaint is that Sam Kinnison made numerous appearences on SNL during this season, but none of those were included on this tape."
1,Curious (More of an Amazon service rating),"I tried to order this on December 22, when it said it ships in 2-3 days. I got a e-mail saying they couldn't get it and need 4 to 6 weeks to try, and now it says it ships in 24 hours. How can this be?"
2,"bad disc, has a blue line through it","bad disc has a blue line, they sent a second one and it does too, this company doesn't seem to get it"
4,Creature holds it's own,"In a decade where bad sci-fi and monster films outweighed the good about three to one, from a company who had not made a good original shocker in over ten years came this true underwater gem. A group of scientists go on an expedition after finding a fossil, but what they run into is an intelligent gill man who does his best to counter their every move and suddenly the hunters become the hunted. The photography is great, fairly strong cast with very natural performances and a classic soundtrck make this a fine film. There are a few slow moments, but overall this is one of the finest monster flicks of the 50's and Universal deserves a lot of credit for taking there time and making a quality monster film instead of making a cookie cutter piece of garbage like the ones that dominated the decade. This one is worth having in your collection."
5,A Sensual Feast!,"If you like John Gielgud's or Peter Greenaway's work, then you should see this film.It is typical of both, in that Gielgud gives a performance one could not fathom anyone else giving, and Greenaway fills the screen with visual and sensual stimulation such as no other director has attempted.On the surface, this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest, with all roles played in voice-over by Gielgud while the other actors portray them physically--Caliban is particularly a delight--but it is also so much more that words fail me.This is like nothing you have ever seen. However, if you are shocked or offended by human nudity, then you should stay away, because it might detract from your pleasure in viewing and that would be a shame."
1,Prospero's Books,"I was disappointed that this version of was chopped into the old analog ""4:3"" television format. The theater version of Prospero's Books was a widescreen movie with a ""16:9"" format or wider. Only the cast and crew part of this movie was shown in the theater widescreen format."
5,unconscious artifact,"this movie makes me feel as if i've been swallowed whole by deja vu, long-forgotten dreams and any other unconscious artifact. brilliant!"
4,Title does no justice,"The text ""Love Planets"" is a very well written astrological text that has been a part of my collection for some time. The title betrays the true value of this text because the direction and information between these covers does not focus as much on ""love"" as one is led to believe. However, the book does an excellent job of characterizing the most significant aspects of the astrological chart. It is during the final chapters that the author provides some room for you to create a natal chart and compare it with a partner's. I use this book primarily for the author's ""astroscripts"" which are their way of describing in a very non-astrological way our perceptions of life based on the position of the planets in our chart. My only regret is that the information provided with regards to casting a natal chart only goes up to 1982. Time for an updated version!"
4,Great book Prucha knows her stuff,I bought this book because I was doing a research paper for a college class and was finding very little information on Native Americans during the periods of George Washington leading up until Andrew Jackson. This book gave me nearly everything I needed. It was a gold mind!!!
3,For younger kids.,Cute book. I was disappointed because I bought this for a 7 year old and it was way too young for her.
4,* * * * Ultimate AX-48B Best Keyboard Stand Ever * * * *,"99.9% fabulous!!PROS: Sturdy, supports heavy keyboards up to 125 lbs, sleek, lightweight, fast setup, self contained with heavy duty carrying handle, built in cord organizers.CONS: No tilt adjustment - boards must remain horizontalBest stand for working musicians. I also own a Quik-Lok 'Z' stand, but the ease of transport and setup makes this a superior stand for gigging."
2,Shorts out in less than 2 years,"I purchased this microwave ib Dec. 2006 and it has been less than 2 years of use. It is starting to short out and I am afraid it will catch on fire. I do not use it for too many things except heating water, leftovers, potatoes and popcorn. I am not happy that it lasted less tahn 2 years with such little use."
3,watch out the sensor,"Don't trust its sensor system.The sensor showed 1 minute and 20 seconds.I saw the smoke coming out of the microwave after 1 minute.The food was all burned.We almost caused a fire in the kitchen.I am glad I was standing right there and turned it off immediately.If the sensor didn't sense the vapor coming out of the food,it should have showed an error sign or turn off the microwave."
4,Good buy,"Received the product within a few days of ordering, even with SuperSaver Shipping. This microwave is easy to use, has a nice-sized interior, and is powerful enough for the usual popcorn, re-heating leftovers and coffee, etc. It's a great value for the price.My only complaint, if you can even call it that, is the door isn't as heavy as my last microwave oven, and for some reason, that bothers me. I like the idea of a nice, solid door between me and the microwaves! However, it does not seem to affect the performance of the oven in any way, so I'm sure I'll get used to it in time."
4,Great compact microwave,"This microwave has been excellent. It is just the right size to fit in my small apartment, but large enough to cook anything I want. The controls are easy to understand and navigate."
5,The Truth,"Before crossing the Atlantic in 1978 on my 22' sailboat, I read many books on celestial navigation and became convinced that it was an inpenetrable subject and then, on reflection, I realized that that could not be so as so many navigators had had less geometry etc than me. I figured the authors did not really know what they were talking about. And then I came across Prof. Blewett at the Boston Museum of Science, teaching on 10 Wednesday evenings. After the first lecture, on the noon sight, she said, if you your boat is going faster than 20 kts then you don't have to come back for more. That is all you need. She was absolutely right. But I did continue -- I took the course so I could do the fun-and-games of star sights too. I can now teach her course in 45 minutes."
3,Not too convinced about this one,"Pros:- Looks nice and shiny.- Center through-holes help hide to some degree the cabling mess I because of many pieces of equipment.Cons:- ""Universal"" hold pieces did not fit perfectly into my Samsung LCD HDTV. Although the TV is hanging there, the screws did not go that fat into the TV's back holes, so I have a fear that after some months, the TV will fall off!! Yikes!- Pricy, although, the quality is good. For $100 less you could find similar products. But the ones I saw did not have a ""quality"" feel to them. I may have been wrong."
5,Recoton DVD647 RF Modulator,I hooked this up to my tv and dvd player and everything plays wonderfully. No worries. It's great.
4,Does What It's Suppose To.,"Just what you need if your TV is older and lacks the RCA type audio video inputs. If plugged into a DVD player, it senses when the power to the player is off and passes the RF signal through to the TV from the cable. If the power to the DVD is turned on, it powers up and outputs the DVD player's signal to the TV. A really good buy if all you need is to input a DVD or any other video/audio source to a TV that doesn't have anything but RF style cable inputs."
3,Poor packing.,This pan was not what I expected. It is much lighter than I thought it would be and the packing was the worst. The box it was packed in was at least an inch shorter than the pan depth and so I received the box domed with the pan sticking up and a few peanuts thrown in. Will not be ordering from this company again.
4,Literary novels of the fantastic,"In future centuries, Crowley may be remembered as one of the greatest writers of fantastical literature and science fiction in the 20th century. Just the same, people expecting adventure and action will be disappointed. These works are about feelings, myths, ideas, wonder, fables, and such. The novel Beasts, for example, uses genetic engineering to tell stories about a lion that would be king and a sly fox. If you like Borges, Calvino, and Lem, you will appreciate Crowley. If you are looking for adventures in space or swordsmen fighting wizards, Crowley is not for you.Crowley's greatest work is Little Big which the best novel to start. Read these stories if you want more."
5,Experiences so far.,I love it. Nothing i've put on it will stick.Its large enough to completely cover the rack in the oven and seems to promote more even & faster cooking of the foods.Cookies come right off with no effort at all.
5,Huge and makes an excellent oven liner....,"This comes in a box that is the size and shape of an aluminum foil box. The sheet comes out of the box 'sticky' (aka 'non-skid') on both sides. I was going to simply leave it out on my butcherblock top, but have decided to leave it in the bottom of the oven for now. It will likely not be used for baking until the holidays. Since I was one of the lucky ones to pay only $9.99, I purchased an extra as a gift. Way to go Amazon!05/04/06: Almost a perfect fit to my butcher block baking station. I find this excellent product puzzling. Dough releases easily yet the mat cannot be cleaned after use as it sits on the butcher block surface because dry, it is sticky. This is a bit problematic since my (almost 30 pound) KitchenAid stand mixer also sits on top of it."
4,Great Jacket,I do like this jacket. I needed something bigger than the jacket I had for riding my motorcycle. The patches don't bother me but some might find them a bit cheezy.
3,3.5 stars: decent movie that has its moments,"""Executive Action"" was rather cutting-edge for 1973 but pales in comparison to Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" That said, there are some moments of interest in this moderately-entertaining feature. I like the soundtrack theme music, some of the acting is top-notch, and some of the concepts and pro-conspiracy evidence is right on the money. Interestingly, Ed Lauter is also in ""Thirteen Days"" (for you trivia buffs out there...)vince palamara"
4,Thought provoking early JFK Assassination film,"This movie is about thirty years old, but was pretty insightful into the events of 11/22/63. I enjoyed the film and was glad to find it on video. I've seen it a number of times and still enjoy it. The cinematography may not be the best and some of the storyline is a little out of bounds, but all in all a very believable scenario is laid out. I would definitely recommend this movie if you have an interest in the JFK Assassination."
5,Probably the best film made about the Coup D ' eta,"Hands down most to the point film about the Coup D Eta. We know JFK was struck in the neck and temple. Therefore, we know Mr. Oswald was framed. The film does an excellent job portraying the framing of Lee Oswald. We also know it is being covered up to this day. Therefore, we know it had to an ""inside job"" since the Secret Service was ordered not protect the President that day. It was a classic Coup where the ""Kings Men"" or palace guard abandon their post so to speak. From the Zapruder film we can see the driver slow down and he and the other agent in the front seat just turn and watch for six seconds until Kennedy is good and dead. Excellent scene in Executive Action about the route change and the communication blackout immediately after the slaying. You won't be able to sleep nights knowing for some reason it was in the best interests of our government , at that time, to kill its own President."
4,"Facts, not fiction","This low budget film makes the plausible case that the assasination of JFK did not involve a huge government conspiracy or mafia involvement. It shows how just a handful of powerful people using ""Black Operatives"" could have pulled it off. The framing of Lee Harvey Oswald is also quite convincing. The one flaw in the movie is when the right wing power brokers say they can't find any evidence of JFK's sexual activities. That proves how well covered up his sexual trists were by the media at the time and well into the 1970s. This movie is well worth a look and using the most basic of facts makes a stunning case for conspiracy."
4,Executive Action Movie,Good movie; makes you think about the possibilities of JFK's assassination. Uses some real footage which makes it more interesting.
4,Executive Action DVD Review,"An entertaining film, which--if for nothing else--is worth to see some fine Hollywood actors in action."
1,Not the real Tom & Jerry,"Not only has Turner ruined movies by colorizing them, they have ruined Tom and Jerry by giving them voices! In this newly made cartoon, all we learn is that they have nothing interesting to say. Stick with the classic Tom & Jerry's and forget about this."
4,Environmental Science textbook,"the book was excellent, clear and easy to read. Unfortunately, it was shipped to me with the cover on backwards"
1,Bad Copy,"I bought this CD because I wanted to have CD quality copies of the original Buddy Holly songs. Yes, I have many of the original copies on vinyl but they have 50 years of wear.Many of the cuts on this CD are NOT the original version of the popular songs. I believe the CD copies came from demo versions.Another point: Several cuts on this CD were from the group Crickets. Buddy Holly was the main member of that group but the songs were published under the name Crickets. This CD fails to acknowledge that.There has to be a better choice if you want clean Buddy Holly originals."
3,Too much politics; not enough technology,"When I bought this book I was hoping for an exposition of the development of tanks. Although there was some of this, mostly it was about how the British Army bureaucracy obfuscated and delayed while thousands of infantry died in pointless mass attacks. But in spite of its faults, I did enjoy it. It was fascinating to know that a lot of the development was done by the British Navy under the direction of Winston Churchill."
5,Buy this CD...,I've heard samples of these songs from other of Ozzy's albums and they are awesome. This album is a definite must.
3,A bit disappointed,"I'm a big Sabbath/Ozzy fan, but I agree with several of the other reviewers in that this compilation is incomplete. Why rehash those old Sabbath demo tapes here? Perhaps Ozzy needs an anthology that omits Sabbath songs and just concentrates on his solo work.It would need to include songs that were foolishly left off this compilation, such as: ""Flying High Again,"" ""Suicide Solution(!),"" ""You Can't Kill Rock & Roll,"" ""Perry Mason,"" and the FULL VERSION of ""No More Tears."" Also, ""Bloodbath in Paradise"" is an underrated tune that could be included. I would say live versions need to be kept at a minimum, because Live & Loud is a great live album that already covers those bases."
3,Typical greatest hits collection....,"Typical greatest hits collection in the sense that it omits numerous great songs by the artist. In Ozzy's case, there is no ""Diary of a Madman"", no ""Flying High Again"" (!), no ""Ultimate Sin"", all classic songs which rank with Ozzy's best, and are glaring omissions from this album, which bumps my star rating down a notch or so.However, the material that is provided is an ideal introduction to Ozzy. If you enjoy this album, I would recommend buying Ozzy's solo albums individually, especially ""Diary of a Madman"" and ""Ultimate Sin"".Final note: Ozzy's inclusion of ""Back on Earth"" was a good one, this song ranks right up there with any of the hits included on this album, and any hit Ozzy ever had. A shame it was excluded when ""Ozzmosis"" was released."
1,This book is NOT clearly titled,I just bought this book and right away realized my mistake - the fine print is that it is NOT Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship. I really am disappointed that Amazon and the publisher would use such a dishonest gimmick to boost sales.
1,Misleading title,"As other reviewers have said, the title is misleading. This is a study companion, and not the book by Bonhoeffer."
1,Will not order from this company again,"Purchased silicone baking sheets for Christmas Presents. The were so dusty and dirty, I had to unpackage and wash each item before I could even wrap..."
5,AHHHHHH,"Ok, I love the Gatlin Brothers, so I love this album. Reminds me of some great times, and I love the harmonies. Get it! You won't be sorry!"
4,Great,A blast from the past. See you later alligator and rock around the clock two of my favorites. Good music.
2,slingy.. and shows all,"The underwear was tempting to buy only for its price. I liked how it looked, but wasnt all too impressed. When i wore it, the first thing i noticed was how uncomfortable the sling system was. I got rid of it, and that aside, the underwear was perfect.. comfortable, fitted really well and looked good. But after what seemed like one wash, the ends started giving away and it now looks more like a skirt than a trunk. the lower edges have flared up (dunno why).The 2 stars are for the initial fit (looked super hot).. I ordered 5 pieces, so I got 5 days of awesome sex! Lol.."
1,This is just horrible!,"I never liked cannibal corpse at all, even when they released their debut album ""eaten back to life"" because, honestly? I dont see nothing special or remotely impressive, about cc. So now cc gives us ""wretched spawn""--- can some one explain to me, what's so difirent about the wretched spawn then oh lets just say vile, tomb of the multilated,eatenback to life, butcher at birth ? It all sounds the same, except with a difirent vocals but its the same damn annoying and talentless sound, with one horrible drummer.Disgrace. Death to poser dm!!"
1,Give Up for crap sake!,"I was a huge cannibal corpse up to their last two albums, but lets face it, their not rewritting the same albums again and again, their rewritting the same three songs. I couldn't care less about their image or lyrics, the day I listen to metal for lyrics and depth will coincide with the day I have my brain removed.As for techinicality, these guys are a joke. This doesn't take true talent. They solo the same freakin scale again and again, and play mostly power cords and harmonics. Any one who thinks this takes true skill is either A) not a musician B) some one who has never studied anything other than death metal and Black sabbath tunes.They just need to give up or come up with something new. They've done nothing to stay fresh or interesting (unlike a band like Napalm Death). The music is about the the attitude and pure butt kicking riffs and these guys have niether."
2,A Funny Joke...Told for the millionth time.,"One has to wonder how someone can devote their musical career to telling the same joke over and over again and still get taken seriously.The joke is: ""Hey, we'll play the most extreme music possible, overdub a singer throwing up blood on top of it, and then give it a title like 'Blunt Force Castration' or something equally ridiculous.""Admittedly, that's hilarious. However, I can't see how someone would want to spend upwards of $200 getting 11 full length CDs of this silliness.As I've seen, there are 2 types of Cannibal Corpse fans: people who get the joke, and people who don't. The people who don't are the ones who gush about ""complex riffing, tempo-changes and sheer brutality"". Come on guys, there are more complex bands out there, and many bands who convey ""brutality"" much more convincingly than these clowns.It's ok to like cheesy horror movies, but don't ever think they're Oscar material."
2,Didn't find it funny at all,"Apparently humor is a personal taste sort of thing. Several reviewers loved this book, but I gave it up after reading 10 of the essays. One was mildly amusing, but I thought the writing was fairly weak and not more than barely humorous. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the library, so I didn't have money invested. I have never heard of any of the contributing writers, so maybe that is part of the problem. I was thinking humor writers in the sense of The New Yorker or Woody Allen, not bloggers."
3,Pleasant but very caustic for one sitting,I like the writers and the stories but so much cynicism in one book required me to put it down before finishing it. It's been a year since then and I'm sure I'll pick it up again but I'm not rushing to it.
4,Mostly Autumn Creates a Unique Musical Experience,"One of the most promising newcomers to the Progressive Rock scene, Mostly Autumn is a hybrid of traditional folk and Celtic music with Pink Floydian Progressive Rock. The results are interesting and impressive. There is a sad undertone to the music with hauntingly beautiful moods created by spacey keyboards and weeping guitars complemented by occasional flute, whistle, and/or violin. The lyrics express human feelings and emotions about broken relationships, longing for home, death, etc. in terms of outdoorsy wintry scenes. The combination of intelligent, mature songwriting, quality musicianship, and eerie influences together create a musical experience which should be enjoyed by fans of both traditional folk and more progressive styles. Even better is Mostly Autumn's followup, ""The Spirit of Autumn Past"", where it has developed, refined, and diversified its sound even further (see review for further details)."
3,Sili8cone Zone Angel Food Cake Pan,"I purchased this cake pan thinking it would be easier to use. I found it unique, but actually harder to clean. The most difficult though, putting it into and out of the oven. I will go back to the harder sided pans."
5,Little House on the Prairie.,I really enjoyed watching this movie. The movie has part one and two on the same disk. It was real neat to know the true story of Little house on the Prairie. It is different from the tv series and it was fun figuring out who a character in the series would have been in the movie. Charles had a different personality in the movie. It was very interesting. I really enjoyed it.
4,This Movie is Excellent,"I saw this movie for the first time about 4 and a half years ago and have seen it about 3 or 4 times since. Although personally, I think the book is better than the movie, but the movie is excellent in it's own right. If you like drama and culture this movie is for you. Sally Field and Alfred Molina play their parts very well. It keeps you on your toes and you can feel and understand the pain that Betty (Sally Field) is going through."
3,It's Ok But Questionable,"I have not been to Iran myself. But I have lived in a Muslim country myself(Pakistan)for somtime.Now to the movie. I felt really sorry for Betty. She had been in too much stress in those days so in my opinion the film is exaccterated (sp????) to quite some point. But it was just her in laws that was messy in the story. Not the whole Iranians in general.Plot: American woman follows Iranian born husband to Iran expecting a 2 week stay. To her horror he decides to stay. He says she can go but her daughter must stay behind ( according to the ""culture"" shown in the movie)Neverless a good show."
5,Not Without My Daughter Review,"This movie is one of my favorites. If people are looking for a good drama, then I recommend this movie."
5,Place A Set,"I strongly suggest that you buy a set for each car in the family. This is a great product and well constructed. My brother-in-Law, who is a mechanic uses the set I gave him for X'mas in his shop...must be good."
3,Not 4 gauge wire,"I guess they're OK for the price, but they are not 4 guage wire, maybe 8 gauge. It would be nice if the wires were molded together to prevent tangling, but it's just 2 pieces of wire with a clamp on each end."
5,A must read for today's world,Read this book years ago. Reading again with a book club group. just as relevant today. Will give you invaluable understanding of the people and the mess going on over there that we see on the news every night. This war will not end until the day of Jesus Christ.
4,an example of very good FICTION,"I really enjoyed this book, except for certain parts:Uris knows how to tell a good story. He can string readers along and get them to feel any emotions that he wishes them to feel. It was very hard for me to stop reading this book.However, if one looks at it as an historical novel, ""The Haj"" falls far short of expectations. Uris does have numerous (and by what I can tell, accurate) events in his novel, But the prejudice that he shows against the Arabs and his idea of causality contribute to making this book not exactly the best way to learn history.I gave this book a high mark, though, because ""The Haj"" is a novel, a work of fiction, and as such, is intended to show the viewpoint of the author, and doesn't need to stick to historical accuracies, but the reader should be warned to take everything Uris says with a grain of salt."
2,Unhappy,"I ordered a used book which was described as ""good"". In fact the book is very used And yellowed. It would be stretching it to describe it as ""fair"" I am disappointed with this transaction."
5,not bias but truth,"After reading many of these reviews I can only assume that many of the readers of The Haj are under the impression that any form of ""bias"" is wrong, even bias based on truth and objective reasoning . I have certain people and countries that i favor over others, certain foods that I enjoy more than others. Why? Because not only are they different, but their differences influece my ""biased"" views. Not all things are the same. Additionally there is such a thing as objective truth. The Haj is a book that explores the differences in the two cultures portreyed and the objective truth pertaining to the history of the region. If Uris is biased, he is on the right side, armed with truth. The other reviewers would do well to read ,""Jihad In The West"" by Fergosi; ""The Lucifer Principle"" by Bloom; ""Battleground"" by Katz, and ""From Time Immemorial"" by Peters, before procliaming any charge of bias and especially racism. the book was excellent"
3,The Haj,"This book is fiction, but MAY present a realistic view of early Palestinian life (early 1900s to 1940s). The author is somewhat graphic in the sex and violence scenes. It also portrays the Palestinians in an unfavorable light from the western perspective; but from my observations living in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, it is not far off the mark."
4,masterful storytelling of a tragic place and time,"I have yet to find a better storyteller than Leon Uris. His research and detail amaze me in each of his books. The Haj is certainly no exception. It is an accurate representation of one Palestinian family and the historical events which surround them. By no means do these characters represent every Arab or every Israeli for that matter, but it is not filled with lies or propoganda as some would like to believe. Uris retains his fast pace throughout the book while developing fascinating characters. Only the tragedy of the story coupled with an inevitable comparison to his other books keep me from rating this book any higher."
3,"Interesting, Prejudices","The Haj although extremely biased towards the Palestinians, annd Muslims in general, still was an interesting and compelling story. The book portrayed Arabs as a blood thirsty, primitive people, an represented the Jews as being benevolent kinly people. Despite these aggregious flaws I still enjoye the book. The book had a good story, a good writing style, and good characters."
4,Excellent resource for buying and maintaining your property,"This book is an excellent resource for buying and maintaining investment property. Its step by step approach is easy to follow and read. Excellent sections on insurance including property coverage and personal liability. It might be too basic for someone that already knows about rental property but for someone starting out, the level of detail is great. Hopefully I wont need to call on the sections for problem renters, but having this book handy as a reference manual is a must."
4,Excellent Resource for Landlords,"This book and CD-ROM set is worth every penny for those considering becoming landlords because it will save you in the long run. It appears to cover just about every contingency that you could think of. The book is 457 pages, with two appendices and a nice index. The CD-ROM is a nice bonus because it contains the various forms that could be necessary for landlords. This is a must read for anyone considering becoming a landlord."
3,Does the job,"I used this to split the sub woofer lead as my Polk woofer has 2 inputs. This does the job perfectly, but then it's supposed to. Doesn't feel cheap and once I installed it I forgot about it, so it's working still."
2,Save your money,"This book is a waste of money. Anything found in this book can be located on the internet, or from anyone who is reasonably knowledgable about the use of tactical firearms. The best ingenious recommendation the author makes for seeing at night is the use of a flashlight! If you know nothing about how to use a flashlight with your firearm, and are clueless about the different qualities of night vision technology I would suggest finding out these things from common other sources and save some money."
2,This DVD has LOTS of problems,"The first and most glaring problem with the ""Carousel"" DVD is the fact that, while widescreen, the image has not been enhanced for 16 x 9 playback. However, that is not where the issues end. The layer change is one of the most abrupt I have ever encountered, pausing long enough to make one think the disc is locking up. The image itself also is full of defects. In Chapter 13 (the soliloquy) Gordon McCray's trousers, as well as some of the background, begin to shimmer, and blend in together. In at least two places, the image jumps. Most noticeable is the scene on the dock where Julie hugs Nettie. If you step through the images using slow motion, it is easy to see the jump was a transfer ""hiccup"".This is a great movie....rather dark for a musical. And the music ranks as some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best. But let's hope Fox does the right thing and puts out a special edition."
3,Great Music - Fabulous Ballet,"While the story line is less than plausible, the final message is touching. Shirley Jones' songs our outstanding, although she seems somewhat typecast, she pulled off the role. The music is great and the ballet sequence with the dancers becoming the carousal animals, stupendous."
4,"Very good, however Macrae lacks charisma.","I enjoyed the film very much, however I thought that MacRae lacked the charisma needed for his role. One other minor distraction....this story took place in Maine, which, as we all know is on the Eastern seaboard of the USA...why then did the sun go down into the ocean at sunset? Doesn't that mean that in this film the sun set in the east??!!"
4,Classic Musicals,"Growing up in the 50s and 60s Rogers and Hammerstein musicals were the highlight of a trip to the theatre or the movies. Now they still provide great music and, even if the style of the drama seems a little outdated, a wonderful glimpse of the simpler genre that we had then. It seems that recent musicals such as Moulin Rouge and Chigago have taken many of the best features of the old R & H musicals and given them a new high-tech flair. It will be interesting to see if these modern productions are still as loved in forty or fifty years.This boxed set gives a good balance of the R & H musicals and shows the creativity and flexibility that this duo added to theatre in their day.Students of modern music and drama could do well to have these assigned as compulsory viewing."
2,Rip Off,Disappointed with quality ...some of the DVD's skipped and picture quality is poor..SAD! Very unhappy because I ordered FOUR of these for gifts....
4,One flaw,"Here is the condensed version...The Sportster 4 is a cool unit ('bout the size of a deck of cards held sideways) and the features are great. The one flaw is that it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to buy the fm relay adapter. That really disappointed me because here I am buying the unit (which is not cheap to begin with) and it's labeled plug and play. Well, you can plug it in, but it sure won't play because you'll get a signal is almost non-existant and a sound that rivals two dixie cups and a string. I wish Sirius had been up front and let it be known that the adapter ($18-$30) is a necessity. Either that or just include the adaptor itself in the package and tack on the extra cost. I would have given the unit a perfect review, but I won't because of the fm adaptor issue. Having said that... when the Geek Squad at Best Buy installed the fm adaptor, it was a beautiful thing- NO INTERFERENCE and crystal clear sound."
1,Do not buy - piece of junk.,"I received this unit as a replacement for the original Sportster unit I bought when I returned the Sportster to Sirius for repair. The unit does not reliably receive signals from the satellite and suffers from frequent loss of satellite signal, even on clear days with no obstructions using high quality antennas. It is basically unlisternable."
3,It'll do.,"I spend enough time in my car on business to justify satellite radio. It squeezes out the dead zones between major urban areas and the quality stations that emanate from them. One of my vehicles, a Ford, has built-in Sirius service and great sound. The other, a VW Passat, has great sound but no satellite radio.The answer? The Sirius Sportster. I can add service into my Passat for just $7.00 more per month. Jason and the good men at Indianapolis' Auto Outfitters took care of cleaning up my son's and my raw installation.Be warned. There is a vast difference between the quality of built-in Sirius components and this kind of off-the-shelf add-on. Still, this is an adequate solution at a decent price point.That's a deal."
4,"Great Product, Poor Mounting Bracket...","The Radio works great, looks cool, and is very easy to use. They have made quite a few minor improvements over previous versions that my friends have. The only problem is that the window mount swivel is not ""lock-able"". When you go over harsh bumps the radio jiggles around and gets crooked/turns/ect...my only complaint-it's not a deal breaker, but really annoying...Overall, still great!"
2,I would pass on this one and I was really trying....,"I set my expectations too high after reading the reviews. I have to agree with the two star review I read. This movie is slow, jumped all over the place adn dragged out. I don't mind low budget, cult movies as those can be very original and entertaining but I could not get behind this one. I say read the reviews and judge for yourself as I am in the minority in my opinion on this one..."
5,Good Quality for the price!,"This product doesn't have any sound defects that I know off so far.The only downside is they have this product shown in ALL BLACK, when I received my product, it was black wire with RED and WHITE female ends.They shouldn't post what they don't have."
2,difficult to wade through,"I'm sure Rosemary is a wonderful person with a real talent who brings comfort to many, but, boy is she a lousy writer. This book is painful to read for anyone who is not new to this sort of thing just because of the sheer awfulness of the writing. Her 3rd book, You Own the Power, is even worse. Unless you are someone who has just lost someone and is new to this kind of material, don't bother with this."
2,One woman's spiritual connection,"I purchased this book hoping to gain more insight into the spiritual realm, learn how to become more spiritually connected, and what we can do to make sense of the unknown. I found SOME very conforting sections; however, I felt too much of this book focused on the writer's difficult life experiences to where (as one reader put it) it became a rambling collection of her personal hardships...almost as if searching for things to say to fill up the pages. She could have said the same thing in half as much time. Not to be mean, but I needed more answers, less trial and tribulation."
3,"This album's not that great, but anyway...","The good news is that this CD is worth your thirteen bucks just for the opening track ""But anyway"" alone! The bad news is that nothing else on the CD comes close. I popped it back in yesterday to see if even ONE other song matched up to the caliber of songs found on albums such as Save His Soul, and got to the end without finding one."
2,Classic Film But Terrible Video Transfer,"This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes."
1,Yawn,"Yawn, yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn. Did I mention yawn? Yawn, yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn. Really, yawn."
2,Great Team Player.... Not-So-Great Solo Artist,"Tony Banks is the most important member of Genesis - but not the only member. It's almost as if he needs Collins and Rutherford to keep his ideas in line. Banks lacks good musical judgement: the melodies and song construction are there - but the arrangements, cheesey keyboard sounds, and poor musical choices make this album close to unlistenable. That being said, it's still nice that Banks did the lead vocals on this CD - he should have sung all his own material... Great team player, not-so-great solo artist. If you're interested in Banks solo efforts, A Curious Feeling and Bankstatement are better choices."
4,Very impressed!,"This is my second Tony Banks' album. The first was 'Still', which features Nik Kershaw and Fish as vocalists with one song sung by Banks. After listening to 'Fugitive' and hearing Tony Banks sing, I was really impressed. I didn't know he could sing! He could pass for a lead singer and I wonder why he hasn't continued to develop as a singer and composer. Banks has a 'haunting' quality to his voice and the first song, 'This is Love' is a hit with my sister, who isn't even a Genesis fan. I am amazed that Tony Banks has not become more well known as a solo artist. Give this album a listen - it will surprise you!"

4,Not the best,Being an ardent Schwarzenegger fan this was a bit of a letdown. There is plenty of action but the underlying feel to the plot believability leaves a little to be desired. Weapons that fire aluminium rounds cause explosions!! Vanessa Williams is well worth watching.
3,A novel desperately in want of a plot,"Mawkish yet self-deprecating, boring yet interesting, ineffectual yet captivating. This novel fits all categories. I could not shake off a feeling of disbelief at most of the side-plots, which, unfortunately, are so convoluted that they tend to obscure the main plot, if indeed there is one ... of which I am not sure. Ultimately, this is a novel as pointless as the protagonist's untimely demise. And yet, strangely enough, McInerney's humor and style do make it an amusing read. Just so long you ignore the fact that everything about this novel attempts to proclaim a vast depth of significance - but significance, and any real knowledge about Japan, are the very elements the reader is unlikely to find."
3,"Enjoyable, but did not engage my emotions","Possibly this is my fault, but I just did not take the story as seriously as it was intended; for me it was a light, enjoyable read. I found the protagonist very likable, but did not share in his pain, (spoiler alert) so that the ending surprised me a bit. I would have to consider it a form of passive suicide, since fighting with swords was so clearly unfair, and previously the protagonist had run away rather than fight. Presumably, the tipping point was his disillusionment with the martial arts, and especially his instructor.The time and setting added to the novel's allure."
2,A beautiful lemon,"One extra star for the looks - but it is not only the looks we are after, aren't we? It worked well for about a year and a few days. In other words, it stopped working at about the time its warranty expired. In the meantime, it also managed to destroy my cabinet since it forgot to shut off properly. No more DeLonghi in my house, I am sorry."
3,"Loved it (for its short life, anyway)","I absolutely loved this kettle for the few years we had it. Like another reviewer experienced, however, it eventually cracked near the base of the water level indicator tube. That crack eventually turned into a large hole. I'll now attempt to repair it with sugru (a ""soft-touch silicone rubber that moulds and sets permanently""). Fingers crossed, but I'm not hopeful. That I'm attempting to repair it is an indication of how much I liked it."
1,"Outdated, offensive even","Like most other one-star reviews on here, I'm appalled at how unsound the ""advice"" being given in this book is. I cringed a bit at the title, (never really considered my kid my ""enemy"") but thought the book could still be useful. Not at all. The author's ""best advice"" is to hand your kid off to a babysitter or daycare as much as possible. Or plop them in front of the television.Very disappointing...don't bother."
5,Your 3 year old: Friend or Enemy,"I too am shocked that there are people who don't like this book. Yes, some of the advice is outdated, but the general behavioral info is spot on. I've looked for more updated information on behavior and advice & have found none to compare with providing concise insight into the WHY of behavior. Just understanding why my child was acting a certain way put a whole new spin on how I deal with issues. The days that it seems my child turned into a stranger, I could say ""ah ha!"" this book told me this may happen. I do love, love, love this book & have recommended it over and over."
2,book for my daughter,I ordered this book after seeing it in an article about behavior of three year olds. I was somewhat disappointed that it was written in 1985. Wanted something more up to date.
5,An Excellent Resource for All,"As a psychotherapist who has received extensive training in Peter Levine's technique of Somatic Experiencing, I find this book to be a helpful resource for my clients who are working through past trauma. The exercises are simple yet powerful. The text contains a lucid and clear explanation of how the nervous system can store undischarged activation from past events, and the process required to release this activation. The result is a letting go of living in the past and the tremendous freedom of living in the present. I recommend this book very highly to all who are interested in exploring how to heal trauma."
2,"These are not the real thing! Not ""PHOTON""","I felt very mislead by this product description from Amazon. This is not the same as a true ""PHOTON"" brand light that I have purchased in the past. The LED is a bluish white, and the ""beam"" diameter is much smaller than the branded ""PHOTON"" light which has a brighter, whiter LED. It has a bunch of screws on the backside (that you can't see in the posted photo) and it looks like it was put together in a sweat shop, whereas the real ""PHOTON"" light says ""MICRO PHOTON LIGHT"" on the obverse and is elegantly constructed with no screws. The key rings are also of a lighter gage, and not of the same quality. I would return, but with the low cost it is not worth the hassle, and this knock-off light should still be handy. Time will only tell if it lasts as long as the real deal. If I could have a ""do-over"" I would have gladly payed more for the real thing; the light that a real ""MICRO PHOTON LIGHT"" produces is brighter and it illuminates a larger area."
4,an ultraviolet light,"Small, compact, easy to use, and a little dim but otherwise a very decent product. I have no complaints. Great for the price."
4,Pistol Pete's LSU Days,"This video has a variety of clips from Pete Maravich's days at LSU. You get a good idea of his shooting, dribbling, and passing skills. I'd recommend it for any fan of Pistol, but you'd also want the The Night of Pistol Pete on DVD which shows his best game as a pro. His LSU highlights are definitely more flashy than this pro highlights."
4,"Really makes taking control of your finances ""do-able.""","Tod Barnhart takes a subject that makes many of us cringe, the taking control of our finances, and puts it in an easy to read and fun way that makes you look forward to reading parts of it everyday. Not your ordinary talking down to us ""common"" folks when it comes to finances. Tod gives you exercises that makes you look at where you may have lost or never had control and find out how to get it (back). By doing Tod's exercises at the end of every section yo become responsible for your own finances and this same responsibility carries over into your entire life. A good read for today's life style, if you read the book pro-actively and do the exercises."
2,Some tidbits of useful info mixed in with a lot of babble!,"The first few chapters were basically an Anthony Robbins book - a lot of babbling about self-improvement etc. There were some useful bits of advice on analyzing your spending, budgeting and investing, but those tips probably only made up 30 of the 250 pages. And you have to wade through the pschyo-babble, bad jokes and just plain boring stuff to find them. I'd recommend buying this book if you are very disorganized financially and desperately need a starting point, and if it was on sale at a big discount! For more advanced info, look elsewhere."
3,Not as good as After You'd Gone..,"I loved the book After You'd Gone by the same author. I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't meet that expectation.I enjoyed O'Farrell's journey through Lily's mind and how she felt in her relationship with Marcus. Her obsession with Sinead was also interesting but none of the characters felt real to me. Lily's leap into a love affair with a man she knows nothing about just seemed a little strange and his avoidance of every question regarding his previous relationship only compounded the evidence of the fact that he was and still is deceptive.While wondering about a significant other's past relationships is natural, I think that Lily took her curiosity to the extreme at times, even tricking her subconscious into believing things that were not true.A good piece of fiction, but I would recommend her other novel before this one."
2,The ghost was too strange,The language is fluent but the story is not very convincing. A living person that at the same time happen to be a ghost is too strange for me...
2,Safe & sturdy but a PAIN to open!,"Easy to install, sturdy gate providing excellent security. However the opening mechanism is EXTREMELY unuserfriendly! You have to push a button (which is only on 1 side), pull up the handle, then pull up and hold the middle of the gate door and swing open. I can only assume the pulling up part is a sort of secondary safety to keep the gate closed even though the handle is not engaged. Guests and babysitter have a HECK of a time figuring out how to open the gate. One of my late arriving family members ""forced"" it open (didn't do the pull up and hold) and it came crashing down in my hardwood hallwall at 4am .... it was NOT appreciated."
1,not toddler proof!,"The installation was easy, however my 21 month old figured out how to open it within 24 hours of us installing it. Needless to say it's going back. I'm just annoyed I got it from another company which doesn't allow free returns like Amazon does, so the experiment has cost us $10 in shipping."
3,wouldn't do it again,"We got this for a one step down into a den. Well, this gate has a metal plate across the bottom which becaome the cause of many trips, baby included. Also, the handle mechanism actually fell open/aprt. the first time, dh just screwed it back together. It did it a total of 4 times before we just took it down. THe opening is VERY NARROW. I have many scratches and bruises on hip from that gate. DH too. If you are REALLY skinny with no dh, okay, maybe. Also, when walking through, when you turn to close and push down, sometimes the plastic didn't go under the red tab, totally defeating the purpose of the gate"
3,Has some problems,"This gate was very easy to install and is very sturdy once installed. It is somewhat difficult to open since you have to press a little button, and pull the lever up in order to swing gate open. It also has a rail across the bottom that we trip on constantly - I assume that the rail is there to add stability."
5,"Good gate, did the job",So this gate's latch is slightly annoying but it did the job and kept my child off the stairs. Like this product and would purchase again.
5,great!,"we wanted a gate for the balcony door and this fit perfectly! i wasn't sure abt tension gates but this is great, no drilling and it's very sturdy. the gate is so simple in design and it's perfect for our place. set up was fast and easy"
5,Great doorway gate!,"This is the second gate I have purchased from KidCo and have been very pleased with both. Large walk-through. Love that it comes with extensions. Easy to install and very sturdy. Gate swings both directions. Took me a while to get used to the lock, but I know little hands won't be able to open.I would recommend this gate!"
2,Overpriced scam,"We bought this gate as it seemed designed to work with the bannister at the bottom of our stairs. Wrong. Meanwhile the photos on the box both show this gate with one or two ""optional"" extensions. This is the most expensive gate on the market to begin with and it's too small to fit anywhere without an ""optional"" extension, at another $35. It went straight back to the store."
2,Dangerous step,"Pluses: This gate is sturdy, easy to install, and is pressure mounted so as to not leave any holes in your walls.Negatives: The bottom railing step is very high. We installed it at the top of the stairs and immediately imagined tripping over it and tumbling down the steps! I am returning this today and will be getting a wall mounted gate. I would seriously avoid this gate for anyone that is worried about tripping down the steps."
5,works,Moved to a place with the worst water I have seen. Unbelievable iron levels that literally turns yellow within a minute of coming out of the tap. This is good on toilets when they get stained with rust but was less effective on clothes that suffered the same fate. Didnt make them white again but a light yellow. This stuff is pretty nasty if you inhale any dust and there should be better warning labels to indicate this. I can imagine that someone will get seriously hurt with this product.
3,"Too gory, bad ending","I thought this book had a little too much detail abou the actual killings. And the ""bad guy"" just didn't fit. His motives were questionable for such heinous crimes. The book is predictable, of course, once you know the killer is mainly after young adults and what do you know, the sheriff just happens to have a teenage sister. Hooper's other books are better written and thought-out, and not nearly as gory. The psychic stuff is a little weird and hard to believe."
1,To Much!,"I really like David Meece and his music, but I think that it is criminal to ask $60 for a single used album! Get real folks."
4,Good story,"This book is really awesome and teaches more than one identity (race, language, and sexual orientation). Some may view it as controversial, but I believe it really teaches many lessons."
1,Full Of Errors,"This book was obviously written and edited by people who know absolutely nothing about Cadillacs. There are glaring inaccuracies on almost every page-misidentified cars, production dates, features, etc., etc. It almost defies belief. The book does contain many beautiful photos but the rest of the book is utter garbage."
1,not very good info,"This book is written by an individual who is clearly not a even flight instructor. In fact, he gives some information that is NOt correct and may well get the student/pilot in dutch with Air Traffic Control.As a flight instructor myself one of my students bought this to help himself with his radio work. The book suggests the use of ""with you"" in the inital call up to control.The term ""with you"" is incorrect for several reasons: It is untrue the pilot is not with the controller.Second, this term is NOT found ANYWHERE in the pilot-controller glossary as part of the AIM.I have heard controllers correcting even airline crews for using this incorrect term.If you buy this book and use it's terinology you WILL hear about it; probably from ATC, and your instructor if he/she is proficient in radion coimmunication, and almost definitaely from your examiner!"
2,Why Prissy?,"This series had a hard time even keeping pace with the former Starhunter (and mind you, that series was not brilliant) And which is the only character that they bring in from the last series? Why ""Prissy"" of course, the most annoying of teenagers. Now I'm not saying Tanya Allen is bad in the role, I'm saying the role is bad, she's just good at being annoying. The series is watchable but it's about what one might expect from a fancast rather than a studio backed tv-series. If you liked Starhunter (the first series) you'll probably enjoy this one, it's much in the same vain but do not look for anything extraordinary, like I said, only watchable."
5,love it,Loved the ending. Great all the way through. Wish more of the original cast could have been in it. It stuck with the story line with a few surprise twist to hold your interest. Better than I had thought it would be seeing as how it never showed in theaters and went straight to DVD.
1,Horrible Movie,"don't waste your money on this, its worth a rent not a buy.the only cool part was vampires flying, but turning this into a twilightvampires then werewolves is low for the lost boy. i like that they showed clips from the original, and the fact they mentioned the past cast members. buy the plot was not good,and they should not mess with originals."
5,The Thirst!,After the Tribe I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good movie or not but they brought frog back and it really turned my head! I LOVE this movie!
3,Old actor still playing kid roles,"Don't get me wrong - I like the actor, he's done quite a few good movies . . . but he's still playing a kid role, when he's approaching 40!The special effects were OK, but a little cheezy; he could have done so much better. Script moved fast enough, I could have used a few scenes from earlier movies, to make it play better. Well, now, I own the trilogy, for good or bad (evil?)."
4,Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry,"The book arrived in very good condition, it has met all standards required for college level course at my institution. Price was extremely fair compared to what the campus bookstore was asking for. Would recommend purchasing this book here to others who need this particular textbook."
2,discontinued by Copo and no replacement parts available,"I love the look of this kettle, however the whistle does not work. I fiddled with it and got it to work for 2 days and then it stopped again. Its a cheap and not well made whistle. I called to get a replacement whistle hoping maybe mine was a dud only to be told it has been discontinued and my only option is to return the whole thing to Amazon and get a replacement kettle. To my knowledge, being available on Amazon does not mean its been discontinued so I had no way of knowing or I would have bought something else in the first place . Now I need to return the kettle.If it wasn't for the whistle I would rate it at 5 stars. It boils very quickly and looks great and is easy and lightweight to pour but if it boils dry and fills the house with steam because the whistle doesn't work, that is a problem!"
2,You Can't Judge a Book - Or a Teapot - By Its Cover,"It looks terrific, but if you plan to use it regularly, be prepared for the inside coating to eventually flake off and add crunchies to your serving. I cannot believe I am buying another (my third, threw out the first two for the flaking problem) but it does look terrific in our kitchen, and My Sweetheart indulges me in plenty of ways that don't make good cents (sic) either."
5,Great Box Set,We have had this set for just over a year. Well worth the money. My 3 year old loves #3 - I'm not a fan of that one but he really enjoys it.
4,Old toy replacement,"This toy was a replacement for one that was lost many years ago. It was bought kind of as a gag for my now adult son. That being said,it's a cute stuffed toy that captures the essence of the Toy Story alien."
3,Great idea...the execution is not good though,"This DVD looks back at the musicals of the 1940s, through movie clips and trailers and while it is a wonderful way to retrospect on the time period, it is nearly unwatchable. The clips shown are faded, washed out or really dark. It is very distracting and the narration is not very good either. If I dare say it, it seems this DVD was compiled as some art school project that managed to find a distributor. There are three of these DVDs in a series: Musicals from the 40s, 50s and 60s. None of them is really any better than the other is. On a positive note, I saw trailers that I never thought I would see, and for that reason I rated this title higher, however, if you are hoping for a really great retrospective on musicals, this falls short simply because the execution seem so after-thought."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I can only hope that Astrid Lindgren never gets wind of this atrocity. However did the creators of this film, think they could even come close to recreating the beloved Pippi films?First of all, to use Florida as a replacement for Sweden, is funny in itself, but to cast Tami Erin in this role was hysterical. Too old to play the character, and not talented enough to bring Pippi to life.Perhaps if you have never heard of Pippi Longstocking before, you might find this movie tolerable, but if you are at all familiar with Lindgren's writing, you will want to stay clear of this movie altogether."
4,See this Film if you want to Feel Happy!,"I think the songs in this movie really make a person feel so carefree, and they really lift your spirits. I think ""Running Away"" and ""Pippi Longstocking is Coming into Your World"" are classics, and I sing them whenever I'm feeling down. The girl who plays Pippi really makes her character fun."
3,Strange but Good,"This is a rather weird production:* casting an uncomfortably nubile 14-yo for the title role;* bizarre gymnastic stunts with tinkling fairy-dust sound effects (just in case you missed the ""Magic"";* funky-pop musical numbers that are as annoyingly catchy as they are awful;* cardboard characterization, choppy editing, hammy acting;* Scooby doo-like voice-unders for the horse and the monkey;* added uncharacteristic weakness and insecurity, detracting from Lindgren's strong, supremely self-confident Pippi.That said, it's pretty okay for the 6-10 yo girl set. I vet all movies before presenting to my 7 yo, and though this one has its good and bad points, it's mostly harmless. Recommended.Actually the best acting is by the girl who plays Annika (Cory Crow), who is sincere, refreshingly unforced, and seems to have had a good time in the production. Whatever happened to HER?"
5,A Die Hard Pippi Fan,"This movie is so awesome. I was deeply saddened to find out that the Blockbuster near my house doesn't have it anymore. When it came out in 88,I went to see it and I LOVED IT. I am going to buy this movie as soon as I can. This is one of my favorite movies of my childhood."
3,What ever happened to Tami Erin?,"When I first bought this movie when I was 9, I never realized until then that there was a Pippi Longstocking movie. I thought it would be interesting to see, since I already had read the book. Tami Erin did a good job playing Pippi. After seeing this movie for a while, I realized that the girl playing Pippi was supposed to be nine years old. In this movie, she looked like she was 12,13, or 14 years old. After this movie, Tami just disappeared into oblivian. The people in Hollywood should try finding her and have her appear on Extra! or Entertainment Tonight. It would be good to see what she's doing now. The movie had a good cast even though the songs were corny. I'm surprised the critics thought this movie was bad."
4,"wonderful quilts, great instructions","this book would be worth buying for the photos of 19th century quilts alone--especially those of susan mccord. that the instructions are first rate, and full-sized patterns are included, makes it even more fantastic.the only reason i do not give it five stars is the inclusion of instructions for so many variations of log cabin and other well documented and frequently presented designs. i would have been happier if the space had been used to present less common quilt designs. i love log cabin and many of its variations, but you can find instructions for them everywhere.that being said, this book is still a great addition to any quilter's library."
4,Great for the Price,"I bought these to connect my mini-stereo system up with my iPod nano. For $5, I really can't complain here. The transfer of sound is good enough, I don't hear any weird noises or anything like that. Are they the best? No, but again, for the price, they do exactly what I need them to do. For that, I'd recommend these."
2,"If You're Not Afraid, Life's Not Worth Living","This book is so out of synch with current thought on the spiritual aspects of life that I finally gave up reading it in disgust. The author's take on reincarnation, for example, emphasizes his belief that your material life should benefit as you ""evolve."" He misses the point completely that it is the spiritual self that is of supreme importance, that a begger living in squalor can be the richest man in the world, spiritually.This book is so filled with fear and ""towing the line"" that I rate it, along with all fundamentalist dogma, as not worth the effort."
1,Delonghi Model EO1238 - Lemon,"Our family has had the Delonghi Model EO1238 just under 2 years. The ON/TOAST/BAKE/BROIL/OFF dial broke. Unit will not turn ON. It was repaired under warranty. 7 months after we got it back from the authorize repair center, the unit broke again for the same reason."
3,Oh well!,"Well, I've liked the 69 eyes for a while, because of albums like ""blessed be"" and ""paris kills"". This album how ever is not really along the same lines. It feels like their music's become softer, less goth n roll, more glam. I was dissapointed, if you are new to the band I recomend earlier works (the two prior mentioned for instance)I will rate this album a 3 , because it was not all-bad, it had a couple good tracks, but for being a band that once released albums that I would actually like all the tracks, I really can't rate it any higher!"
3,The Cat Who...Cook Book,"Definitely for Cat Who Fanatics. This book is well written and has great recipes from the series. My only objection is recipe duplication--too many apple pies, cinnamon buns and caeser salads. One of each would be enough with additional recipes of Mildred, Iris and Polly. Overall, I liked the book but would have liked to see more variety."
2,"Not horrible, but get Brave New World","This is not a bad effort, on par with Kilroy Was Here. Love is the Ritual (Glenn) and Back to Chicago (Dennis) are clearly the best tunes. Love at First Sight is totally sappy. It is clear Dennis either doesn't like music with an edge anymore, or simply can't write it. I don't mind his ballads, if they're good. Check out Fallen Angel on Brave New World instead. Glenn does a decent job, although Tommy has a more distinct style."
1,AAARRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!,Did I just accidentally give this junk 5 stars? Never do anything in a hurry!Consider this a retraction...
3,not to sure it works,"I tried these, and didn't notice anything too much different for pain then aceteminophoen or ibuprofen..was hoping something more natural would work better"
5,This is a must have,This book has been a god send for me. There are many unique techniques in this book that have been very useful. I recommend this book espically for the beginner but also for the experienced therapist who wants to expand their horizons.Thank you for writing this!
1,hardly works,I bought this to adapt and old set of headphones. It works in my mp3 player but not in my computer or guitar amplifier. It doesn't seem to plug in properly. I don't know why.
1,You should be aware...,"I'm a soon to be parent and I ordered this book for my mother. I either did not read the reviews or the description of the book close enough, and was not aware that the book had religious references. I knew I ordered the wrong book when the first page mentioned ""the Lord"". Other references included ""praising God"" with your grandmother and Jesus' birth on Christmas. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting down this book because of it's religious nature, personally - it's not for me, but people should be aware of its contents.I'm sure that many people find this a beautiful book and I'm not doubting that, I'm just saying that it may not be suitable for certain families."
1,Cash Cow at his best,"Don't take me as just some chump trance addict. I've been in the scene since about 95 and I've always considered Oakenfold as my fave dj, but lately he's been going on a big downhill slide. Gone are the days of Goa and epic trance, in are the sad 'force fed' prog tunes. Sasha, Digweed, Burridge....they do Prog....not oakenfold.Anyhow, cd 1 is definatly a a trainwreck and a half. That sums it up. Only Naryan manages to save it some decency. I find myslef just putting in ""Fat of the Land"" however.Cd 2 on the other hand manages to create some flow, even though it goes through breakbeat, trance and some erick morillo-ish disco!But to end I will give props to the Russian (mp3.com) group PPK for breaking out big time and scoring an perfecto contract. Hopefully with Hernan C., PPK brings some decency back to the perfecto camp.I suggest gettingStaton Warriors - Staton SessionsThe newest Tyrant Boys cdTimo Maas - Connectedand of course Mr Dance, Tiesto - Magik 7"
3,Not the usual.,"This 2CD set seems to move away from trance...... but it's an interesting ride. The opening track, ""Waiting"" by Nat Monday is something unusual but cool at the same time. I can't say, but this 2CD is different but not really in a good way. And I don't feel any closer to Ibiza at all. I was hoping for something better from Oakey after hearing a few of sets on the Area1 tour."
1,The Problem With Oakenfold,"While at my local music and book store, I went to the magazine section to pick up a copy of BPM. ""They said Oakenfold's the #1 DJ in America... it's ridiculus"" called someone reading another magazine. He doesn't seem to be the only person who feels this way. Recently, a wave of Oakenfold hatism has spread across many of the trance and house faithful. This CD, Oakenfold's most recent ""real"" album shows why this is so. This CD is quite disappointing, with repititive and unoriginal songs trying to blend with a level of ""originality"" that seems forced. Oakenfold's been one of the more adventurous DJ's in the past (Oslo CD 1 and Essential Selection Disc 2) but this album is just tired rather than inspired. That's why it maddens so many people that Oakenfold's so big. Excellent DJ's with original styles and brilliant mixing always get the undercard when Oakenfold's involved. I'll bet this CD will sell thousands more copies than Sasha's ""San Fransisco"" or Digweed's ""Hong Kong""."
3,When you set the bar so high...........,Well this is an interesting compilation to say the least. The first disc is definately outside of Oakenfold's usaully trance heavy style. There are plenty of breaks here but these tracks aren't the gems of the breaks genre either. It is nice to see an attempt at stepping outside of traditional oakenfold but this mix must have been represenative of the music you'd here at 11 am the next day in Ibiza after no sleep and plenty of ........The second disc is more in line with what you'd expect from Paul but the track selection is still outside of what you expect. There are a lot of vocals that do go nicely but initially it is a bit of a shock to hear some of the vocals in track 3. The mixing is good and the trained ear cannot detect any obtuse sycronizing errors. The transition in the late half of disc one is pretty catchy. It is more on par with oakenfold expectations but overall 1 half of 1 disc doesn't receive 5 stars it only receives 3
4,Dreamy & Haunting Classic,"I really loved this dreamy and haunting album from the first listen but I was completely won over when I saw Suzanne tour on this record. Not a particularly entertaining or energetic performer, she wisely used the images from the CD booklet (and others) as surreal backdrops. It allowed me to literally swim in the richness of each song. The images deepened the lyrics and enhanced the music. I know this is a review of the CD but I can no longer separate the music from the feeling having each song wash over me as it did at the concert.My suggestion is then to do something quite revolutionary in this day and age: buy this CD (okay that already is revolutionary!), trust me - buy this CD, find an uninterrupted hour in a perfect environment for you and you can listen to it in its entirety. Allow the music to be your sole emotional focus. I think you`ll find that you've purchased and experienced a rare and beautiful piece of art."
1,Does not work for staircase shown,Babygate does not work for staircases shown. Also the door wouldn't even close. Not happy at all and returned it.
1,Horrible - returned immediately,"This piece of junk was a mess the minute we opened the box. The threadbars were sheared in several places, stopping the nut before the frame could be secured against the walls.After doing the manufacturer's work for them and re-tapping the threadbars, we tightened the nuts until the plastic end-pieces were firmly against the wall; but they kept slipping and sliding regardless of how tight they were. Applying more pressure dented the sheetrock in our walls.Then, as our daughter was observing us trying to make this poorly manufactured pile of garbage actually work - it fell, clipping her mouth on the way down.So much for ""KidCrap"" products. No more for us.Needless to say, we replaced it and are now happy with a wooden version from a manufacturer who actually knows how to build something."
2,NOT Non-stick,The very first set of muffins I made in this pan stuck horribly. I ended up with half of each muffin stuck in the pan. For cookware that claims to have a non-stick surface this was less than impressive. I received this pan as a Christmas gift (and it took over six weeks to finally arrive) and I am highly disappointed
2,"Ms. Gordimer, please lose the dashes and the ""mystery""","This would be a great book, save for the ""mystery"" that Gordimer wants to impart on us. I am an English major at a respected university and read it in a class. The book left me wondering ""What is going on here?"" Gordimer's favorite punctuation is the dash which makes the story hard to follow. Does the dash indicate a different speaker or different thought or something completely different? Gordimer also tries to make this book inaccessable to all but the most enlightened by substituting pronouns rather than use proper names and giving very little background to the characters and story. It's hard to care for people that you don't know. I lost interest in the book after the first few ""chapters"" (more like breaks in the story) but was forced to finish because it was for a class. This book goes into the ""don't bother"" pile. Read Heart of Darkness or Things Fall Apart instead if you're interested in British Colonialism."
5,This book kept me interested from cover to cover.,"I wasn't sure what this book was about when I decided to read it, but I must say that it is one of the best books I've read. July's People was a chilling story about the aparteid in South Africa. It tells a compelling story, that follows a white family through those violent times. I gave this book five stars because it is so well writen, understandable, and so exact in details. The vivid descriptions of the atmosphere during this period in history is comendable. I would reccomend it to everyone who loves good literature."
2,Tastes Change,I enjoyed this CD alot about five years ago. . . . Chart-toppers from the early '90's. My how I have matured! I am looking to sell this to a used-CD store to buy some timeless music by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.
3,A Good CD,"Overall, a pretty good CD. The high points are ""I Will Remember You"" and ""That's What Love is For"". The low points are ""Galileo"" and ""Baby, Baby""... sorry, but ""Baby, Baby"" is so dull and repetitive. If you like any of her songs though, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get the CD."
5,Great product! Better than ever!,I am a long time CA customer and with the release of this product I have not been disappointed. Works seamlessly with good performance and has a lot of great features--not to mention a guarantee that protects me from viruses or identity theft. It has my two thumbs up.
5,Great bag!,"I bought this bag somewhere else, but had to review it because it's so cute, great quality and very stylish! It's got a great length to the handles where you can actually get it over your shoulder. Even more beautiful in person than in the pictures!"
3,Strawberry kettle,This kettle looks very good. The problem is it has a small bottom and takes a long time for the water to boil. You can also see the screws on the handleIf you are going for looks its good but functionality is limited
1,Horrible edition,"I am not sure about everyone else's copy but mine was missing pages 281-312. So, missing nearly 100 pages made it unreadable. I didn't notice until it was too late, so I have a $12 dust collector. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!!"
2,Don't bother--save your money!,"I had given 5 stars to ""Valuation,"" but I feel that this workbook is practically useless for its price. The problems in this book are not very challenging; they merely require echoed answers instead of questions providing in-depth analysis. Common questions include: ""Name three issues in valuating X company"" or ""Name three reasons why X is preferred over B."" These are simple questions one could easily answer by taking copious notes. I had expected much more challenging questions from the workbook, but I was sorely disappointed. My advice: Buy ""Valuation"" but avoid buying this book."
3,Valuation Workbook (3rd edition),"I was hoping the workbook would have more practice exercises revloving around the manipulation of financial statements. Instead, it was heavily multiple choice and short answer questions. Not exactly helpful for someone trying to learn by practice instead of information memorization."
4,"Great help for Valuation of Companies, very didactic","I needed to know how to valuate companies, and this book really explains detail by detail how to do it."
5,silicone zone bread pan,This pan produced evenly baked loaves and the removal was very easy.Very well made.
5,Greatest 80's movie for me!,"I grew up on the original and it was awesome!Just so people do not get confused, YES, there are 2 versions.One is the original-unedited. This has some cursing and at the Pirate ship part there may or may not be an octupus part.I saw it also aired on Disney. This version was cleaned up. They edited this some, which includes the cursing was gone and replaced those words with other cleaner versions of it.You can probably buy this version as well but I'm not sure how one could compare them."
3,The Goonies,"Now, for a few years I've been hearing rumors of a second Goonies movie. I really hope it turns out good if done. We all know about the whole ""curse of the sequels"" but let's keep our finger crossed. Original actors and similar plot. This movie is good and is not to be messed with unless done the right way. This film has a ""uniqueness"" to it."
2,I like some types of Korn...............,"but this movie was way too corny for my tastes. This movie managed to use every single cliché that ever existed. This ranges from the group of misfits going on an adventure to save their home from evil corporate rich people to mobsters with guns to a pirate treasure cave filled with booby traps to a fat kid who saves the day to a disfigured grotesque monster suddenly gaining human knowledge and capabilities and rebelling against it's owners to love between two 13 year olds. The reason that I gave this movie two stars is because there are worse films than this one and one scene was funny. Other than that, I do not recommend this film to anyone who likes hardy boys and other meaningless kids detective stories."
3,I like this movie but...,"I just love this movie but there is only two problems. First of all the language is horrible. I don't know why they ruined this great film with that. Another thing, that part when they show the naked statue is gross. My parents won't let me watch this anymore and I'm almost eleven. Good movie but not for the little ones. Ages 13 and up would be good. Other than that stuff this is a great movie. Taylor"
4,Classic,I grew up on this movie. So when finding it at a great price...I was sold. The benefit was that it arrive within days.
5,OUR brat pack...,"I was a kid who loved watching brat pack movies because my sister was five years older than me and a teen ager of the eighties. I was just some kid who watched her films. But MY movie age group back then loved some Goonies. Everyone loved Mouth. Especially when he translated for the new housekeeper. Besides that, everyone wanted to be one of those kids (except chunk...stuck in a cellar with that --that THING). My favorite part of the movie? When mouth took back his quarter, because that was his wish, and it never came true...""so I'm taking it back; I'm taking them ALL back..."""
4,Fun movie,"Goonies is one of my all time favorites, because it's funny, and a great family film. I love all of the kids who act in the movie. it is a good movie to see againand again! D. Dacey"
5,Never say die!,"I remember this movie from back in the day, and my little boy loves it as well. Great classic!!"
3,Totally 80s,Hilariously cheesey Spielberg involved film starring Corey Feldman with soundtrack music by Cyndie Lauper. Following a treasure map into an underground realm to race ahead of bad guys. Overall an enjoyable film you can take the kids to.
2,Gloppy Goonies!!!,"Based on an amusement ride, this movie is pure Spielsbergian which means pre and young teenagers will love it, but us adults will not.Personally, I couldn't take the kids nonstop yapping. It took me two tries for me to get through the whole movie.E.T. this is not!"
5,Goonies says it all,Great movie. If you havent watched this movie you are missing out on an adventure & i recommend everyone watches the GOONIES
4,Put soap in the mouth!!!,"I enjoyed the basic story ,but some of the language is really Bad!!! )...).Anyway, the main idea is that these kids find an old treasure map, they decide to follow it to were One-Eyed Willy's treasure is. They run into outrageous booby-traps and to top it all off, they are being chased by danagerous criminals!Before I stop writing, I want to say two things, 1. Beware of the language. 2. I would recomened this movie."
4,Spanish Version Sucks,"First of all I love this movie.That being said, I wanted to share this movie with my girlfriend and her family, who are Mexicans. The spanish version speaks spanish way too fast and the kids voices are way too high pitched. Worst voices for the parts of the characters. Her family couldn't even understand some of the spanish being said."
1,Screaming and yelling from beginning to end,I bought the Goonies / Gremlins / Gremlins 2 combo. I got very tired of listening to the boys yelling and screaming from start to end. Many scenes dragged along too long. I had to fast forward to alleviate the annoyance. I do not understand the 4 1/2 rating. Don't waste your money and time.
5,Baby Ruth! Ruth Baby!!! Ahhh!!!!,"Finally this great movie comes out on DVD. I'm getting it as soon as it comes out. I've seen it at least 20 times, but with all the extras it's worth it. Long live Sloth! Rocky Road! Sloth Love Chunk!"
2,Too much swearing for a kid movie,"I recently ordered this movie to watch with my 7 yr. old grandson. I barely remembered seeing it when it first came out with my son, who was at the time 12 yrs old. I recalled it being somewhat of an adventure/mystery, which it is. However, the kids swear throughout the movie and in one scene, one of the boys is taunting another telling him about seeing his mother naked, taking pictures, etc. All totally unnecessary for the story line, but I guess Spielberg felt it made it more real. I shut the movie off before finishing--It is still a good story, but if you try to avoid foul language situations for your kids, this is not going to be ok, especially for younger kids."
3,A Little Disappointed!,"I love the Goonies because it is a great movie. But one thing I really hated about the DVD was the fact that not all the deleted scenes are on it. Everyone says they are most likely lost but then again you see them turn up on Disney and all the bootlegs in good quality. Also for all you fans out there, the snack and shop scene is not the full thing. It stops right in the middle of Brand yelling at Mikey. On Disney and the bootlegs it shows Mouth steal the map from Brand's pocket again and then the kids run off. So all in all, the DVD isn't all that great. The only good thing is pretty much the commentary."
1,There is a reason why it's on SALE.,To the point:If you are a musical fan there is not much that this DVD will inform you that you don't already know.The thing that really bothers me is the bad quality in most of the clips. But if you are doing a research than you might find it's quite helpful. To conclude they should just sell it as a VHS format.
2,Pretty Good!,"Loved the first segment! Yes, some of the trailers are faded but most are great . They really touched most musicals made (Except for the great ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"") Some of the info may have been inaccurate, but most was on the spot! The short featurettes are a rip off and do end abrupty before they are finished! I really tink its worth the 10 bucks for the first half!"
2,Picture not accurate!,"I contacted Amazon directly, as well as the manufacturer of this machine, FunRise toys, and both assured me that it came with legs reaching the floor as the picture shows. However the description does not mention them, and lo and behold, they were NOT included when the machine arrived at my home. It is much cheaper than the larger model, but if you need a machine that reaches the floor, think again before getting this one."
3,War and graft - with cheese,"The irritating 1960's style anthem songs are the biggest downfall of this movie. Well, that and the fact that Eastwood has about five lines. OK, those things, and the ethics of wanton plunder of an occuppied country.On a positive note, Don Rickles does a great job as the supply sergeant with an eye for fiscal gain. Telly Savalas is the sour master sergeant mother-henning the misfits. I'll also add that the tanks they used for the German Tiger tanks looked very convincing - and I don't think they were M48's doctored up to look like Tigers.Overall, a solid 3 out of 5 stars."
4,best war movie,the kind of fun and comedy that you never expect in a war setting great job no cussing and still gets the job done
5,"""They set out to rob a bank- and damn near won the war!""","Boy, do I ever like this movie. I've watched it a million times and I never get sick of it. It's funny, well acted, and enjoyable. The story is simple: a platoon of GIs led by Kelly (Eastwood) set out to steal gold from the Germans, located in a bank behind enemy lines, with support from 3 Shermans commanded by Oddball (Sutherland). Others include Telly Savalas, Don Rickles. Carrol O'Conner plays a General who is rooting for the Platoon back at headquarters, not knowing the purpose of the operation. I wasn't disappointed once with this film. The characters are likable (however Oddball's ""negative waves"" gag grows stale). After several ""battles"", they arrive at the town, dominated by 3 Tigers (the Tigers were mocked-up using T-34s, the same ones used in Saving Private Ryan years later). You'll have to get the movie to find out what happens. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Kept it,"This is a great movie but the DVD had a couple of ditgital break ups. I have noticed with some Eastwood, Wyane, and MGM films this is pretty common."
3,Entertaining and funny WWII film.,"As an avid Clint Eastwood and WWII movie fan, this film is very good. Kelly (Eastwood) works against those who orchestrate war to their own advantage. Leaving the American army in the dust as he breaks enemy lines eventually recruiting the enemy to help reap the pot of ""gold"". Sutherland, Savalas and Rickles round out the rough edges."
5,Hugh,Best wireless microphone I have ever used. Anyone who has used mine is in complete agreement with my assesment.
3,SARCASTIC MISTER KNOW IT ALL,"I waited a long time for this b/c I'm a fan of both Jane's and the Chili Peppers. To get any scoop on either (I guess) justifies the purchase -- ir that's how I'm living w/ it. Fact is this book isn't worth the LIST price ($29.95). It's a mish-mash of transcripts, letters, articles, essays, etc. It's always advantageous to repel any spell and not gush. I gushed and gushed my review re: Anthony Kiedis' book. There's something different about AK's book in that specific words absolutely had to have been chosen by the musician (of freakin course the book is co-authored, as one brilliant reviewer penalized it for). The story beneath is the foundation, that which the ghost works w/, and Dave's book is choppy. Buy it used. It's worth the wait. Don't pay $30, which I did at Tower like an idiot b/c I couldn't wait."
1,The Poison in the Well,"I continue to mourn for my friend, Michael McCann, who died by his own hand in September of 2002. His death gets lots of attention in this book. The author would have you believe their principal made him kill himself. She says another staff member said it first, but she sure repeats it over and over in her book. Think about it, can any person make another person commit suicide?I think this author is trying to ruin the reputations of many good people, and she is showing disrespect to Mr. McCann's family and friends by publishing and trying to manipulate this tragedy. If she is willing to exploit that, what else is she exploiting?"
1,"Should be named ""NOT Automated Web Testing""","Very misleading title. I bought the book thinking it would discuss tools for automated web testing (gee, I got that idea from the title somehow); but the book is only about basic procedures in general testing. ""Testing Computer Software"" and ""Testing Web Applications"" by Cem Kaner, et al. had better information on basic testing procedures AND automated testing. I really wanted the authors to give me my money back since the book is NOT about test automation. And the ""load testing for e-confidence"" pdf on the CD is available FREE OF CHARGE from Segue's web site."
3,Gets the job done,"You've seen this item before in about one hundred different forms. It's your generic, curly-wired headphone extension cable, available at pretty much any home electronics store. If you are looking for a curly-wired headphone extension cable, this one will suffice. Personally, I'd recommend that you buy a straight wired cable since the springiness of the cord can be bothersome at maximum extension, something I didn't think about when I bought one of these myself."
5,Great So Far...,I have used 35 of the 50 discs so far and haven't had one failure. Primary use is data storage and burning homemade films to DVD for sharing with family. The price per disc makes this a pretty good value. Would recommend based on my experience.
1,BAD Batch,have used 100's of Verbatim inkjet DVDs and had always been A+ quality.This batch 95079 ate AWEFUL. Look for any other Verbatim DVDs rather than this batch.
3,Some of FM's best songs pre-Buckingham/Nicks...,"Two years away from the white ""Fleetwood Mac"" album, which introduced a new line-up and sound, the Mac weren't exactly muddling along as much as they were lackadaisically finding their niche in rock & blues. Although this release wasn't a big seller (which might have been the fault of that cover painting--UGLY!!), several of the songs here are winners, with Bob Welch doing his best work with the band and Christine McVie bringing in more of her lovely, intriguingly melancholy odes to both giddy love and burned affairs. The rambling, cheerful ""Forever"" (co-written by bassist John McVie!) sums up this album's spirit most accurately--joyfully directionless, and sometimes quite heartfelt though without a truly solid ground to bank it. That is until the closing number, Christine McVie's ""Why"", which plays like a powerful sucker-punch to a dead romance. 'B'"
4,Vastly underrated.,"Poor Fleetwood Mac went through several line-up changes as their career as a band progressed. What amazing is that, with a couple of exceptions, they were and remain remarkably consistant.Mystery To Me contains some great tracks, including Bob Welch's appropriately hypnotic FM staple ""Hypnotized"" and Christine McVie's closing track ""Why"" standing out with some of the best piano/guitar interplay in the band's career.A personal favorite is the group effort ""Forever"", essentially an ode to a nice day."
3,A frustratingly inconsistent cd,"Mystery to Me contains some of Fleetwood Mac's best individual songs. The first four songs - particularly Christine McVie on ""Believe Me"" and ""Just Crazy Love"" make this a cd worth having. Several other songs are also good. However, there's a lot of dross. An average cd, overall, but a good listen if you skip to the good stuff."
2,Hunting as it is ... Boring,"I have read everyone of CapStick's books. Death in the long grass is the greatest book every written about African hunting. Every story in that book grabs you and takes you to the Africa you dream of... This film bring you back to earth and shows you what every hunter already knows ... Hunting is 99% boring and 1% action... and this film is too. My final word is buy every one of his Books, not his films. IF you have all of Capstick book buy the films to finish your Collection of Capstick"
3,"solid case, sketchy in latching, but likeable","I just received my case for my Baby Taylor. My guitar fits great and snugly. Unfortunately, I also got the case that refuses to be completely meshed closed between handle and bottom latch and then around to bottom hinge. I got it to protect my guitar at a great savings and it will meet its purpose. I just will try not to be too bothered about the gaps in the closing edge. Other than that aesthetic issue, one should appreciate how well one's travel guitar fits in this case. It will definitely survive the overhead bin when everyone squeezes everything they can in there to avoid baggage costs. Definitely better than the gigbag in that respect. If you have a precious Taylor guitar, this is a good case. Just realize that, unfortunately, the quality assurance team doesn't catch all for alignment during closure and latch and it may make one a tad peevish about the case overall."
3,Review,The book is in good condition but is missing audio CD. This was not indicated in description of book. I was puchasing the book thinking the CD was still included.
3,A part-reference part-survey book,"The book addresses the diffcult task of giving an overview of hindu myths, with the relevant content. Naturally the book is a part-reference and a part-survey kind of book. The range of the themes are adequate; covers the major aspects- Vedas, Vedic gods, the evolution of purna Gods SIVA, VISHNU, DEVI. The last chapter deals with the objectives of Vedic mythology, Epic myhtology and Puranic mythology. This is an interesting part of the book. No way, such analysis will have acceptance from all."
1,It is not just the bias ... but the end product....,"Inaccurate - but moreover poorly written. Other reviewers have said it well when they expose the bias. It is not a 'sourcebook' by any means; she needs to change the title of the book. It makes me feel sorry for her - clearly she needed a gimmick to get published - unfortunately, that is often how the publishing world works. I am well versed in Sanskrit and am a Hindu - this is not a study - nor a translation - it is a lie. I rarely am offended - but here, I am ... if she cares."
2,Does not work as described,"I didn't really expect much for this adapter since it was only a few dollars, but I bought it because of other people's reviews and I wanted to be able to play my keyboard without bothering other people. My headphones fit perfectly into the adapter and the adapter fits into my keyboard, and I can hear sound, but it's mostly just static. No one would be able to actually play with that sound. I would not recommend buying this."
1,Field Guide gone bad,Mopar fans - DO NOT buy this book. It is full of numerous errors. The Author and Publisher should be ashamed. Just proves anyone can write a book!
4,Lindo mazo de cartas,"me encanto los dibujos del mazo de tarot bien definidos pero lo unico que no me gusto fue el color de la cubierta de cada carta ..seria lindo q le hubiesen puesto mas colorido., me desiluciono un poco ...pero para principiantes los dibujos estan bien definidos.."
3,Nice deck but...,"This is a nice RWS type deck (with a few deviations). It is done is soft pastels and easy to look at and to read. The book that accompanies it is also well done and easy to read. The big problem is the card stock used. It is very flimsy and the cards bend easily. They should have put more condsideration into this, as it cheapens the cards and makes them hard to really work with."
1,Beware!!!,"Be careful with this item shipped by J&R Music and Computer World. I purchased 6 of this due to the product image. It looks like leather and has a nice texture, BUT J&R Music and Computer World shipped a totaly different product, with another design in a vulgar plastic that doesn't looks like the image of this product. Very dissapointed."
5,"Really good, Really funny, Really fun.","I've played medievil on Playstation, But Medievil Resurrection is the perfect game for the psp, I do not remember any humor of medievil one, but in this medievil, The humor is off the scale! I love the genie in Dan's head! They also changed the statue guys, in the first one, they were supposed to be scary...but in this one...It's kinda cool looking and cute.Anyways, with the better graphics, cool puzzles, and ripping the sombies arms and legs off...This game is the most extreme!!"
3,not the greatest game to buy,"for christmas my parents bought me this game, of coarse iwas addicted to it for about 2 weeks. But soon after it didn't get very fun. It was just the same old story, fight and kill, fight and kill.Personally, i think that you should not waste your money on this game, buy tekken,daxter, fifa, or need for speed."
3,Spend your money wisely,"This is one of the easiest tool available for simple DVD creation. Having said that, however, this tool lacks many features found in other more expensive tool. If money is one of your concerns in choosing the proper tool, I'd suggest you stay away from this tool. The reason is that Tsunami/TMpg charges fees for every upgrade. So far, I have spent $50 for TDA 1.5, $25 on Dolby Digital audio plug-in, $11 to upgrade to 1.6, and $60 to upgrade to 2.1 for a total of $146 so far. Yet it doesn't have all the features. For the price of one more upgrade, I could've spent the $199 on DVD Lab Pro and got free upgrades. So choose wisely."
1,"Red Light, Green Light, Hype - Avoid",The only person making money from Wade's books are Wade. Avoid this guy. There are some many other books that are excellent.
5,A vision of the bigger picture,"I reread this book 35 years after college. It reveals amazing insight. Brown said in the 50's that we would pretty much go down the tubes when our resources ran out unless citizens of the world act intelligently together. So far, we have ignored his warnings and pursued narrow self-interest with great zeal. Though he did not anticipate the information revolution, he still could be right that a depleted world will one day support only a limited population living an agrarian lifestyle.(You can read all his conclusions in the last 15 pages)"
4,A gargantuan synthetic effort,"Coleman's book is one of the most ambitious sustained attempts to theorize the social world from a single perspective -- and one which, unlike systems theories (e.g., Parsons, Luhmann) has clear predictive consequences. Of course, the book is just as interesting for where rational choice theory breaks down (e.g., with regard to obligations to family and extreme religious groups, and when it comes to preference formation) as for where it obviously applies (e.g. to corporate law). Even if you're a rational choice skeptic, there's plenty of value by way of concepts (e.g., disjoint vs. conjoint authority), though at almost 1,000 pages, this is by no means a quick read -- best surveyed under the guidance of someone who knows where the interesting bits are. (If I may, chs. 1-5.)"
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY SONY DVD PLAYER!,"I purchased my DVP-735 back in 2000. It was a wonderful ""flagship"" product, and I even rated it highly on a website such as this. However, since then it has been locking up in every movie that we watch (generally near the end). The irony is that a local agent - Next Electronics charged me > NZ$300 to have the pickup assembly replaced (with a 3 month warranty). Guess what - the damned piece of crap failed after 4 months - even worse than before. SONY, if you are listening, I am not too happy with your product or customer support. The local ""Sony Centre"" in Wellington seems to brush off faulty product that is beyond its warranty date. Every time my flatmates and I watch a DVD, it locks up - MOST EMBARRASINGLY! DO NOT BUY A SONY DVD PLAYER. If I could go back in time, I would have burnt the NZ$1,100 I spent purchasing this DVD player, rather than suffer its problems."
1,"Awful, do not buy","Really wish I paid more attention to the negative reviews. I bought three blankets in purple. These smell really awful. I expected that from the reviews, but had read that the smell was gone after washing. So I washed one according to the instructions. This stained in inside of my washing machine, and huge clumps of wool came off. Now the stupid thing still smells terrible. They are also only 70% wool, which is not stated in description. The blankets are coarse. I am returning the remaining two, and will probably throw away the one I washed. Wish I could give this no stars."
2,Everything I dislike in mysteries,"A sheltered orphan, desperate for adventure, blows her meager inheritance on a boat passage to South Africa to find what was behind a murder in England.This book had everything that annoys me about amateur detectives: eager beaver sticking her nose (and almost her neck) into what doesn't concern her, miraculously tripping over clues, deus ex machina rescues - you name it. The storyline alternates between two narrators, the overeager girl and a staid MP whose primary goal in life is to be comfortable; as usual, the two narrators quickly became confusing. I barely got halfway through before quitting, and the ""series character"" of Colonel Race was still a minor part of the plot when I gave up."
3,Not for just a causal listener...,"If you are just a causal fan of either pearl jam or sound garden then this collaboration might not be for you. In my opinion there are really just two tracks that have mass appeal and the rest is an acquired taste. I got the album when it came out, and now thanks to the marvels of technology you can just download the two good songs which are Hunger Strike and Say Hello to Heaven."
3,It&#65533;s A Complete Your Collection Disc,"Sort of a Pearl Jam prequel, although Chris Cornell has a lot of influence. Here this Seattle supergroup demonstrates the debt grunge owes metal. Stand out tracks are `Reach Down' and `Hunger Strike' Seemed pretty special after Pearl Jam hit it big, but has not aged well."
3,good...,"many songs drag on and on in the tradition of soundgarden, but the rest are great. wooden jesus, pushin' forward back, and hungerstrike are the highlights. a must for any pearl jam fan and especially for soundgarden fans since most of the the songs were written by chric cornell."
4,Legendary Muscians Paying Tribute 2 the creator of Grunge,although the grunge era was before my time in the music scene I found that I enjoy the sound of the Seatlle era bands like Sound Garden; Pearl Jam & Nirvana played a major role in the shaping of my sound so thank you Andrew Wood an Mother Love Bone for the creation of grunge if you were to purchase this album after listening to it you will notice that its like listening to a new age blues influenced grunge sound real great treat for fans of the Seattle sound
5,BEST thing for a smoking household,"There is no better smoke remover than this spray for my household. My family is full of smokers so there is a definite stinch of smoke in my place. This got rid of all types of smoke even ""illegal"" smoke. You only need a light spray for an entire room. Try not to inhale the air freshener, it will make you cough. Its very strong but leaves a clean fresh scent afterwards. Love this stuff and will continue to buy."
1,Great movie but fullscreen. When's it coming on blu ray???,One of my favorite Disney live action comedies. The sequel is pretty good too. The dvd is only fullscreen which I refuse to buy. How about putting it out in blu ray? Love to see a combo pack of it (so that those with just dvd can enjoy it in its widescreen format as it was intended).
2,where did the widscreen for honey i shrunk the kids go,i whould have liked it better if it were widescreen i think fullscreen movies are a thing of the past please do away with full screen if possible but if the movie was only filmed in full screen then i dont mind but if the movie can be made for full screen then it should thank you yours truely a disturbed fan of disney movies.
5,LOVE IT,GOT SUCH A GREAT DEAL AND THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW LOVE IT AND SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. THANK YOU
1,Absolutely Terrible,"My sister has one that seems to work pretty well so I bought one and it didn't even turn on. I figured it was a lemon and exchanged it for another one. That one turned on and heated up for about 10 seconds, then stopped and won't heat up again. I've used a ton of different straighteners, dryers, curling irons, etc and I have NEVER had one that doesn't even work once! COMPLETE WASTE!"
2,Never recieved; but Amazon was great,"I have been ordering from amazon for a long time now and this is the first time I've ever has problems. The straightner was backordered, which I diddnt know about until after it was ordered, then it dissappeared before making its way to my apartment. I was promptly issued a refund - in the end no harm no foul. This is just the risk you take when ordering through the net but after I finally got a customer service rep on the phone I was well taken care of."
4,hair straightener,"This product works wonderfully, I get my hair done in much less time than with last iron I had. Works best on dry hair, only problem I've had is that if my hair is not 100% dry, I burn my fingers with the steam."
5,Excellent and fast,"I have a thick long hair and always hoped that I could get a product like this that makes me look like I just came back from the beauty salon. I could not believe my eyes the first time I used it. It gives me a fresh beautiful look everytime. Convenient, fast and sturdy. I've had it for over a year now and wish I had it long ago. It is a GO!"
4,love it and hate it,"I have pretty thick, very curly hair that usually frizzes and gets really static whenever I straighten it, this is the ONLY straightener I've found (and I've had probably 8 to 10 different kinds) that actually gets my hair straight and it STAYS straight, and it usually doesn't dry out and get frizzy, I love that aspect about it.Unfortunately, it dies. It's hard for me to find, only one retailer sells it where I live so I think I may start getting it offline, but I always paid 30 dollars for it, and it would die 6 months to a year after purchase. It's really frustrating because it did it while I was in high school the morning of my picture day :OBut, I still would recommend it, I'll continue to buy it because it's the only thing that's come close to getting my hair to stay straight. I haven't tried the wet/dry feature, just not interested in that part."
2,Already broken,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it is already broken. It won't turn on and she used it maybe 5 times. On a good note, I think it did a nice job when it worked. It has a warranty but I have to send it in."
3,"Nice sleeve, doesn't fit the Asus Eee 1215-N","This sleeve is recommended by Amazon for the Asus Eee 1215-N 12.1"" netbook PC but the sleeve is not large enough. The netbook is a tight fit in the sleeve alone; with the power supply, cord, and a netbook bluetooth mouse in the front pocket the netbook has to be forced in. I returned this sleeve and am looking for something else."
5,best case for Acer Aspire One 10.1 Inch,"Don't even think about buying another carry case for your mini-netbook! This is the best one! Great look, very sturdy and with enough room for everything you need. My son is in loved with his new Acer One and the case, and I envy him for the last one, because it works better for my Acer Aspire One 8.9 Inch than the case I bought for it.:-)"
4,"Great for travel, maybe overkill for commuting","Bought it primarily to walk to bus to commute to work. Wheels great. Only downside is the size...bigger than I ""pictured"" (even though dimensions were provided). Compartments well laid out, easy to get to. Like pull out PC bag, especially for airport screening."
1,Please DO NOT get it!,"I got this for my 11in Macbook Air. Since it's designed for 12in notebooks, i figured that there would be enough room. My Macbook can barely snug in to the case. Plus the material is not very sturdy. It is truly a Sleeve ONLY, not a case, after only 3 months of use, there's a big hole at the bottom corner, exposing the cheap white foam lining. I will upload a picture for proof."
2,Not worth it for that kind of money,"It's only good to carry a laptop but if you have some documents to carry there is not enough room. The front compartments are okay, the zippers are good but generally if I saw this backpack before wouldn't buy it."
3,limited space,Great backpack if you don't plan on carrying too much. There isn't much room.If you want sizable storage look elsewhere.
3,Fiction supressed or not?,"Well, this book was a hard read. I started out thinking this was some secret government approved report, but the introduction removed that thought. So it is supposed to be a joke, purposely written with the intention to do nothing with it. A lot of work has gone into this. The language is carefully bureaucratic or scientific. That makes it tough to get through, and I sort of speeded through the last chapters.Though it is all supposedly fiction, the reasoning and line of thought are logical. That is why the content of this book can not just easily be dismissed as fantasy. I would not recommend this for anyone looking for excitement. But interesting never the less."
5,Red 2,"Awesome perfume!! Very hard to find, not even sure it is made anymore. Not a strong over-powering scent, very subtle and enticing. I love it when when wife wears this."
2,Description is misleading,"I bought this from seller -bearbooks- . This book was described as used with minimal wear/ highlight marks/ bends. I received it, it was a book from a library. It was marked ""discard"" by the library, not withdrawn. The cover has huge bends and many bent pages. It is still readable, but annoying that it came in such poor condition. I guess I should not complain because I only paid $3 total, but still...The book itself has an awesome storyline and I always enjoy reading this series. I love a lot of the characters. It is a somewhat-old, good manga. It just never caught on with the main crowd, unlike Naruto and Bleach etc...Conclusion: this is an awesome book, but make sure you get a good seller"
1,"Bill Shields -- FRAUD. Not a Navy SEAL, never saw combat","A friend of mine was suckered by this guy. Went to Harrisburg, PA and visited the man in his home! He was sorely disappointed by the experience, and wondered how such a human wreck could have once been a human-death-machine. Turns out Bill Shields never saw combat and like a Mechanic's Mate 3rd class in the Navy ca. 1973. Sorry to burst any bubbles out there -- he writes some pretty intense fiction."
1,"Low quality, no sound","I gave the DV-740U as a gift and am ashamed. After only five months of use, which included playing three DVDs and two CDs, the sound stopped working. The person I gave it to wasn't able to use it enough times to experience the problems others have had, but the lack of sound from either the RCAs or the coaxial digital output has made the DV-740U nothing more than a paperweight.The best part is that Sharp only covers labor for 90 days, so it'll cost my friend shipping, a deposit of [$$$] and who knows how much more to fix it.Avoid this DVD player and consider another brand."
4,"Well put together, but dense and too expensive.","I used this book for my biochem class. It is pretty with very nice images and good ""explaination boxes"" Sometimes it is not in depth in some areas, and too descriptive in others. It depends where your focus lies."
5,Roy Rogers movie,This movies is in mint condition. Its Trucolor is bright and sharpe. I am very happy with this movie.
1,too little product - too much freight,"This company charged exhorbitant freight - more than the cost of the product on an item that only weighed approx. 1/2 lb. It appears that they are trying to make their money on ""shipping & handling"". Will never buy from them again."
4,Should have bought it earlier,"Bruce Dickinson. Da Man. He is one of the best singer I have ever heard.(Escept maybe when he sings live) The reason why I give this CD only four stars is because I bought 'Chemical Wedding' first. And I loved it. While Accident of Birth is a great album, it pales compared to 'Chemical Wedding'. But about this CD. The songwriting are above great, and it was surprising for me to hear that The Tribe of Gypsies mainly write Latin rock music. Roy Z is one of the all time best... Better then Adrian Smith. The highlights of this CD are as following, 'Starchildren', 'Darkside of Aquarius' and Man of Sorrows"
5,relayer,thanks to amazon.com i was reunited with an old friend.I love dexter's tunes and the ability to shop the world withamazon.com - long live the 70's
1,I can't rate this because it won't work in my camera,This cabel WILL NOT WORK IN THE S7000. I bought it for that purpose and now I am stuck with something that I can't use. One size fits most but not mine.
1,Unintentional camp and a very bad film!,"Now we all know at this point that Tom Cruise is a little odd and not exactly a brain trust, so it shouldn't be too surprising that he chose to make this awful piece of trash after becoming a pretty big star. But Bryan Browne? The terrific Aussie actor from FX, A Town Like Alice and Breaker Morant? He must have been desperate for cash. Poor guy - He went back to Australia not too long after participating in this hideous venture.This movie is both unintentionally hilarious at times, and really just plain bad at others. I saw it at the movies with my husband and we both agreed at the time that it was a real stinker. The script is atrocious and completely unrealistic.If it smells like a bomb and it looks like a bomb, guess what, it's a bomb! A big smelly bomb. Only watch Cocktail if you've consumed several cocktails yourself!"
4,Cocktail,Always liked this movie from 1987..Tom Cruise and Elizabeth Shue are great in this film..Always liked it and a good story!
3,Fun Movie. Great Sound-Track!,"Yes, it's very predictable, but these days what's not. It's light hearted, it has good music, and Tom looks pretty darn good."
4,great alphabet puzzle,great puzzles and illustrations. Just wish it had pegs on it like a normal wooden puzzle. Thought it did from the picture which is why I ordered it...but found out it didn't' when it came in the mail. Still very nice though...it was my favorite one because of the easy to depict pictures.
4,Basic Overall thats all,"I have used the Nat'l Geo series before and have found them to be good which led me to buy this. Just like the ones before it is written for the basic user. While I am not a complete novice, the book does draw out some higher skilled techniques for growth. Readabilty is important to me and this book scores high in that regard."
5,"Makes you feel happy, happy, happy!","My 15 year old daughter bought this CD and loved it so much that she wore it out! My yougher daughter and I (the 40+ mom) both really liked it, too. All of the songs have a great message and are fun!"
5,Fun and unpretentious,"This is a great, light-hearted CD. The group obviously enjoys playing their music. They take on weighty subjects with levity that betrays their eternal perspective. The music is a mix of rock, ska, and unpretentious fun. They mix upbeat tunes with introspective ballads. Great CD to add some spice to your collection or to stick in the car CD player, role down the windows and recapture the joy of driving."
4,"Great fun, to say the least!","Whether you're a fan of astrology or not this is a fun read. Consider it a 182-page food guide, based on the sign under which you were born. Certain tastes and food cravings belong to people based on fire, water, and earth signs. Fun when with a group to compare who likes what and how you stack up with the theories posed here."
3,Cars the video game?,"With only slight modifications and some new minigames, it seems that the developers of this game basically took the original Cars game and overlayed thier new storyline and characters. Radiator Springs looks just like the Cars game, it's not a bad thing, but I was surprised of the extreme similarities between the two. If you want a digression from the original Cars game, try the Race-o-Rama game instead. Enjoy your playing."
3,Anime from when I really got into it,Picture quality and sound were good - Japanese language(I don't watch dubs). Watched the subtitles. Only drawback was that near the 3/4 point the subtitles started wandering. The spoken line and the timing of the titles was off by about 1/2 to 3/4 of a second.
3,"Good, but not great","In terms of overall production value, ""Wicked City"" is quite similar to ""Demon City"". The storyline, animation, and characters are quite watchable, but rather perfunctory and not very inspiring. They would not be in the same category as the great ones, e.g. Akira, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in Shell, and Wings of Honneamise."
2,toldja we shouldn't a landed on this planet !,"This movie tries hard to deliver but fails. I expected alot more suspense, chills, SFX. What we get is a pregnant crazy woman offing all her crewmates? why? she's pregnant by a praying mantis lookingalien which you only see twice thru the whole flick.Judy Geeson does give an interstellar performance. She sure as hell won't be getting any oscars down here on earth.Like i said the film tries but fails, the acting is so-so.The sets are kinda legoland build-it-yerself type.There is a beacon of light though, the film does leave itself wide open for a sequel. I hope whomever takes *that* task does a whole helluva lot better than the director of this clunkerPU!"
3,O.k. Alien rip off with a blend of Zombie Flesh Eaters,"Horror Planet is a cheap british SciFi epos that deals with nearly every topic trash fans love to watch: women raped by rubber monsters on a remote space colony, crew members turned to undead maneaters, gory FX and extremely cheesy sets. On the plus side I have to mention the really good cast and the creepy atmosphere that the movie delivers right from the start. The pretty bloody FX unfortunately were trimmed in the US to achieve an R-Rating, so gorehounds shouldn't expect to much. If you liked 80-SciFi-movies like Creature or Virus (the italian gorefest, not the recent J. L. Curtis movie) you will be well served."
2,Food critics and experts who can't use cutlery?,"I enjoy cooking shows and some reality TV but this is more than a little irritating. Some interesting content is lost in an intrusive and bland soundtrack and repetitive, predictable editing. Of some concern is the number of (self important) judges who appear unable to handle cutlery."
5,DVDs,"A well-produced, not predictive thriller! Great scenery setting and an outstanding story depicting actors Poitier, Berenger, Alley & Brown at their very best! One of my all time favorite movies!"
3,Sidney saves the movie,"The charisma of Sidney Poitier is still as powerful as it was 30+ years ago. The scenery is breathtaking and well filmed.Now for the rest of the film...it's ok. There really isn't any chemistry between Tom Berenger and Kirstie Alley. They are both great looking but that's about it. Clancy Brown is good, and Poitier and Berenger together have some fun scenes. I liked this film, but it just wasn't as good as it could have been given the acting talents and the beautiful Pacific Northwest background."
4,Good movie but Chris Tucker over acts,"This movie was very well done and really entertaining. The acting was good and the plot held together well. As with all action movies the destruction is so exagerated that one must realize it is only a movie to rate the movie a 4 or higher. It made a 4- to me. I will watch it again. However, I generally fast forward the overacting scenes with Al Pacino and Nicolas Cage and Eddie Murphy and now Chris Tucker. I guess it is like pop singers today. They have to scream to make a name. I give it a 3 1/2 star rating. I would go 4 1/2 if not for the actually boring Chris Tucker continual jabbering. He would be really good if he would cut it down to the level of Martin Lawrence."
5,Still the best!,"If your interested in the paranormal, this series will not let you down.The various cases are interesting, Buell & his cast actually have screen presence by just being themselves, and the outcome of each episode is not always predictable.I've viewed Ghost Adventures & Ghost Hunters, and similar themed programs, yet none have the overall appeal this series consistently offers.As i pre-ordered ""Season three,"" here on Amazon, i was also knocked out by the low, low price!You simply can't go wrong for value & entertainment."
4,Ontario strikes gold,"First of all, i classify the machete as a 9.5 out of 10 stars. The machete performs excellent in terms of edge retention(1095 spring steel) the geometry of the blade makes it a great chopper, it bites really deep. It eccels at all the jobs a machete should, my only gripe is that the steel is a bit hard meaning that it is a little bit brittle and prone to chipping when striking a hard surface or in cold weather, other than that it is terrific."
4,Soundgarden - 'Badmotorfinger' (A&M),"First came out in 1991, looks to be Soundgarden's third record. Believe I caught them on this very tour as support band for Skid Row. Talk about an odd match. Their first CD with bassist Ben Sheppard. Even though I followed Soundgarden through out their entire existence, I hate to admit that I rarely pull out their music anymore to play at random. Tracks I'll always prefer off of 'Badmotorfinger' are the one-time Mtv late night favorite ""Rusty Cage"", ""Outshined"", the over-played ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Searching With My Good Eye Closed"" and ""New Damage"". Know I probably need to dig up my copy of their 'Ultramega OK' disc - that was my favorite Soundgarden title. A true grunge classic."
4,Bad Ass Blues,"Soundgarden had a range of influences, but for me this is still a blues album. In my mind, Chris Cornell is a blues singer, and a damn interesting and fine one at that. This music accomplishes the hard task of even pleasing ""metal"" fans while still very clearly maintaining a true blues aesthetic. ""Rusty Cage"" is beyond aerobic in its excecution, and ""Outshined"" is to me an absolute blues classic, in its pounding insistence and powerful kick in the crotch rhythm."
3,Interesting,"Chris Cornell has a great voice, no doubt about that.I like ""Outshine"" a lot and few other tracks, I would say that I like half of the album, the rest didn't catch me, or maybe I didn't catch it !Who knows ? If you like Grunge rock, you should like this one a lot."
5,definately one of the best albums of the 90's,"This album is just pure rock at it's finest. Chris Cornell's voice is at is peak of range and clarity, Matt Cameron's drumming is classic, and the overall feel of the album is incredible. This is Soundgarden at the height of their heaviness. As time went on they refined their sound a bit more, but this album still shines.Standout tracks like ""Rusty Cage"", ""Searching With My Good Eye Closed"" and ""Mind Riot"" are nothing short of classics. This is a must-own CD for any hard rock/metal fan."
5,Oh Yeah this is great,"My god I only got this yesterday and I have been playing it like crazy. For all of those of you wondering my favrite songs off of this album are Rust Cage, Outshined and Jesus Christ Pose."
1,When is it gonna arrive?,I ordered this a couple weeks ago and still havent recieved it.I think I did everything I was supposed to do in order to order it so why hasnt it arrived?
5,Great!,Its a trusty Etch-A-Sketch. What else can I say? The 1960s box was pretty cool also. My son has been playing with it a lot.
4,A great gift,"Since I had bought this particular item for my granddaughter for her 5th birthday, I asked her. She said she really liked it and enjoyed making pretty designs. My kids had an etch-a-sketch when they were younger and it was one of the most used toys they owned. This could be why they are still around today."
5,La mejor musica de Navidad de los Pops,"Increible y como lo comenta alguien por ahi, hace mas de 5 a;os que poseo estas grabaciones, primero en cassette y luego en CD y son geniales, brillantes, alegres, reflexivas y estimulantes.Los medleys son geniales y las versiones con el Coro del Festival Tanglewood son hermosas, la direccion de Williams es generosa, espontanea, vivaz y recia. La orquesta es pulcra y suena genial.Un CD navide;o espectacular."
5,excellent!,"A little over a year i went to Toronto and saw the Phantom of the Opera. I was mesmerized. Immediately after that I looked up everything on it. Not ust the romance story but the true story. One day while looking for Phantom books on Amazon.com I came across this. I had already read a few books that were quite horrible-cheap knock-offs hardly resembling the stroy I had grown to love. So....I took a chance on this one. I bought it in my next order. I loved this book. It made me laugh, cry, practically pull out my hair in aggravation sometimes. IT's quite a long book, but i finished it in 2 days. And I have read it several times since then. The way the author portrays Erik is just amazing. The reader doesn't see him as a deformed, obsessed man but as a beautiful, gifted child. This book moves you-seriously. But don't take my word for it, buy it and read it. You won't be diappointed."
1,Disgusting!,"~This book was absolutely disgusting and revolting. It begins with the story being told by his mother, telling how she hates him then it moves on to his teenage years where he becomes prey to all sorts of disgusting things. If you have any morals whatsoever don't read this book. I personally am a Phantom of the Opera fan but this book was not a welcome addition to the story. I realize that the reason some of the things are in there are because the author wants to give us a background as to why"
5,A must for Phantom fanatics,"For anyone enamored with the fascinating story of the Phantom of the Opera, this book is an absolute must-read. After the original novel by Gaston Leroux, Kay's novel is probably the most widely read (and perhaps the best-loved) literary Phantom adaptation. Meticulously researched and skillfully characterized, this novel spins a darkly enchanting backstory for the man who would become the Phantom of the Opera. Readers will be satisfied with the extensive amount of original fiction here. Unlike many Phantom adaptations, this novel does not simply recount the famous events at the Paris Opera; instead, it seeks to flesh out the rest of Erik's tale, both before and after he met Christine Daae. It is full of compelling original characters, and the carefully-crafted plot fits well with Leroux's original vision, informing it without attempting to alter it. Though now out of print, this book is certainly worth tracking down and savoring for yourself."
5,Why Did It Have to end?,"If you havn't read this book your really missing out on a great experiance!For those of you who have read Gaston Leroux's novel ""The Phantom of the Opera"" this book gives a reflectoin of Eriks sad childhood. When i read that his mother would not even give him a kiss I started to cry. It was his Birth day and all he wanted was a kiss! I thought this book got deeper into the emotions of Erik and the other characters. I was recomended by many people that I would Fully enjoy this book and what can I say?When it was over I was sad because its like one of those books that you never want it to end .The only thing that I did not like about this book was that it ended.I recomend this to any Phantom Phan!"
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR PHANTOM PHANS!,"I love this book! I could not put this book down. I am a HUGE Phantom Phan and this story is so beautiful. If you are a Phantom Phan, or if you just love a good story, then you must buy this book immediately.I don't want to give anything away so just read it and enjoy."
5,Delicate,I was broken harted when I lost my copy of this book and it took me a good two years of finding another copy of it.I am thrilled to have it in my home again.
5,The BEST BOOK EVER!!!!,"This book is my all-time favorite EVER! I liked Gaston Leroux's book... because it's the original. However... this book is so lush and timelessly beautiful. Erik is so much more real in this book, and seeing as how I'm Erik-obsessed, it was so good to actually ""get to know"" him. If you want to read a book that will make you cry, laugh and... never forget it... read this classic!! PLEASE!!!"
1,700 pages of boredom,"The only reason I finished this book is because once I start a book, I finish no matter how bad. The writing style of this book is odd and hard to pay attention to. I can't tell you how many times my mind wondered and I didn't pay attention to what i had just read. Too many implications with no answers. Do I come to my own conclusion? I just didn't get it."
5,Soundgarden's PERFECT ALBUM,"These are ones of those albums i consider perfect. with the exception of ""Half"" which is a song i dont really care for it is perfect. This albums has tons of radio hits but every song on this album could be a radio hit.I'd give this album 10 stars"
4,Great Rock Album,"When someone you know starts to diss the ""grunge"" scene from the early 90's -- take out this album. This is just a great rock album with a lot of diversity -- there's the upbeat rock of ""My Wave"", there's the 70's retro-rock style of ""Black Hole Sun"" and the powerfully emotive ""Fell On Black Days"". Highly recommend if you're a fan of similar music."
5,Really Good Album!,"Soundgarden made a really good album here. A Follow Up to Badmofinger ( their contribution to the 1992's grunge phenomenon). This is a really good album. Production is good. the songs are good , Criss Cornell is one of the most gifted singer around. The lyrics are good and the blocket and the whole cd is nice. Not a single filler and a fabolous album. I recomend this to anyone who are tired of all the [bad] that is in the music today and for any music fans. thank you"
4,"One of their best, but not 100% good grunge...","I really like this album nad it's great to listen to, but some of the songs on the album don't need to be there. I love Mailman, My Wave and Black Hole Sun more than any of the others and Head Down, Spoonman, and Like Suicide are other songs that really leave an impact. It's songs like Fresh Tendrils that are just annoying. I wish that they would have left that song off of the album and about two others. I don't like skipping around. It's better that Down on the Upside, though. That album is just OK for Soundgarden. Overfloater reminds me of Pink Floyd and that is the high point on the album. There are other good songs, though. Buy it if you're a Soundgarden fan. If you want a good album, buy either Superunknown, A-Sides, Badmotorfinger, Louder than Love or the Flower EP. Those are your best buys. Don't disregard this album, however, Mailman and My Wave are songs that a Soundgarden fan cannot do without."
5,AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is absolutely one of my favorite albums of all time. No kidding.
5,Must have,This is one of the all time best. I like every song on it. If you love rock this is a must have.
5,Laughed so hard I cried!,"I picked up this book the other day on a whim at the bookstore and loved it.It is just too funny. I found myself laughing my head off. The contemporary romance is hot too and the story is very cute. It is set in Salem, Mass. A very enjoyable read and the characters are memorable. I would recommend it. A laugh out loud book, I mean I howled and laughed so hard in parts I was crying LOL.If you want a saucy romance and to feel good then get this one. The book as a whole is awesome!"
3,Adorable,An adorable read for those who like young lit. Cute characters and fun story. Great spell writing and respect for the craft.
3,magical and moronic all rolled into one...,"this book is unusual that I found myself liking it one minute and dispising it the next. While it had it's moments of cleverness, it seemed equally filled with sophmoric ""harlequin"" like drivel.I agree with the other reviewers-the love scenes were 1-way to many ""pri*k tease"", almost-had-sex scenes, and 2-all were strictly sex scenes, there was no love to these scenes, more ""horny teenager"" type of sex that seemed played more for titilation than romance. Explicitness in romances is fine, IMO, but as long as there is some emotion behind the motion:)The good points-1-several fun and well written minor characters, especially Logan's son Shane. 2-the two characters do show some maturation and growth-but that and their realization of their love came sadly, to late in the book to make it enjoyable, more like a niggling suspecion of time wasted:(.5 stars for a great cover, 4 for an interesting premise but sadly a 2 on actual story. Altogether-3.5 stars."
5,No matter which song I listen to...,"So, refreshing, originally, touch the simplest yet most direct part of my heart connected to God. Very simple yet powerful words back by the best arrangement of melodies behind crisp direct interpretation of a clear soul. Like what a ride with a dolphin through he great ocean might be like."
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Unfortunately, the outlet covers are cut wrong for my outlets, so I requested a return. NO REPLY.And, while I did install the light plate covers, the colors are more muted and less vibrant than the photos here."
4,Funny!,I saw this movie on VHS years ago and enjoyed it. Now many years later this movie still has me laughing!I love the ending!
3,Gift,I enjoyed this movie because just for a split moment I saw my men LEON and HEAVY D. I like the way the girls beat up the crook and the butler did remind me of Alfred from Batman
4,"Sweet, charming movie","I thought that Halle Berry and Natalie Desselle were delightfully funny in this film. 2 girls from Georgia go to California chasing a dream, get a little side-tracked, but achieve their dream anyway, meeting some wonderful people along the way. The characters played by Martin Landau and Ian Richardson were SOOO funny - especially when Mr. Manley goes to the record store, looking for ""The RRRRRRRap section."" I thought that the actors playing the girls' boyfriends were good too - a little kooky, but genuinely good people. Nisi and Micky may appear to be gold diggers, but it turns out they have hearts of gold, and for this, they are rewarded. Who says good girls finish last?"
1,A book that will talk you out of going to Portugal,"Surprising for an RS travel book. I've used his books heavily in planning many a trip. His team usually does a nice job of providing a balanced view of a country or city. This one showed mostly the unpleasantness and mediocrity of Portugal. Can't speak for the Spain section, as I'm not considering travel to Spain in the short term, and did not review that as carefully."
1,STAY AWAY!,"I purchased this HDTV at the end of November, and it has not worked since. The company refuses to take any responsibilty for there own product, and has not helped at all in the replacement. The store I purchased it from SOUND CITY in Franklin/Denville NJ, also refused to take the HDTV back. I would advise anyone looking for a new HDTV, NEVER to buy Zenith or LG, and NEVER shop at SOUND CITY. I have bought numerous electronics from AMAZON, and they have always been great. Buy from here, good company, good prices and good products. Just remember no ZENITH or LG. - Mr. Adam Carbery"
3,hard bounty,I'm a Rochelle Swanson fan and to me there wasn't enough of her as she is only a minor character. But she does look great as usual.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Ridiculous story. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Such a waste of good music. Just pitiful.
3,Typical Tim Allen,"I bought this DVD ""used"" specifically because it was a Tim Allen movie and they are usually just OK for me, but it looked kind of funny, and it was. I never would have paid full price to buy it new, but I paid very little and the entertainment value was ok. Tim Allen is much funnier on Home Improvement than in movies, at least for me. His comedy seems to work better there. But there are always funny moments so it was worth buying used, watching once, and then passing on to a friend or putting in a yard sale. Not something I would watch over and over. Sigourney Weaver was a pretty funny character in this movie. It's worth seeing once."
3,Not to easy to put on,"It show what it was sell for, but better product exist, as AussieBum who do the same but you can put it on in a minute."
1,Disappointed,"We couldn't get through one movie without seeing, ""Clean Me"" REPEATEDLY on the screen. Prior to getting this message, you could see digits on the screen start to blur. We played all brand new, clean disks and had the same result. All three movies we watched did the same thing. Bummer, this one's going back."
3,Good depiction of NY seedy street life,"I as someone who grew up NYC can relate to the shady and filthy street atmosphere portrayed here. Thats the way NYC was through out the mid to late 90's. There was a lot of racial mixing going on during that time with the hip hop era booming so that portrayal is also accurate. I thought the Lex character was miscast. They should have found someone younger. A 40 year old clean cut white italian guy talking in ghetto street lingo is a big exaggeration. Overall a very interesting movie. The raw nature of it took away from the excitement that a fake hollywood touch would bring to a film like this but, then again it wouldnt look to real if that was the case."
5,Great Discontinued Cookware,"I bought this cookware for my sweetheart as she wanted stainless steel clad cookware with silicone handles. This is the only good brand that I could find. When I went to order an additional 8"" skillet I found out that this style of cookware had been discontinued by the manufacturer. I phoned them and their answering service couldn't tell me why. Now I can't get additional items to expand the cookware."
5,luxury at a great value,"After shopping many outlets, I stumbled upon these treasures..I gave these pillows as a gift and the recipient was very pleased with the quality and highly impressed that they were ""name-brand"" he definitely thought I splurged on the price!"
2,Uncle Walken we hardly knew ye...,"Disappointing because it had potential. Alison Elliot in the lead is a complete stiff and shows virtually no range. Lots of shots of her in the second half of the movie staggering around (as the wife or the witch) looking distraught. There's your drama and it just ain't enough. Jared Harris does a better job as the husband. Tough to get involved though when the married couple they portray comes off as a bit repellant. Walken does his usual thing (which I like) and breaths a bit of life into the midpoint but the story turns to complete mush after he leaves (too soon). As the site review mentions above, the underwater photography is quite pretty. Not intended as a ""serious"" horror movie to be sure but Nadja (also an underachieving movie) had the better sense of humor."
3,Good toy,I agree with some negative reviews. It is hard for toddler to use the needle as it is too short. Besides figures are empty inside and you need to find the opposite whole from inside.But my son just loves the figures and plays with them. Sometimes he is lucky enough to use it as they should be used.
2,Revisionist,"Some revisionist points need to be made in the interest of the whole truth, but the author is one-sided to a fault. The book is glib, full of sweeping statements, a work of opinion and propaganda, not history.In our time, people are so used to the idea of the U.S. as the great world power that they may have trouble in understanding that in the 1830s, on the world stage, the U.S. was a minor, upstart country with an uncertain future. Mexico, on the other hand, even after its disastrous War of Independence, was perceived as the heir apparent of the fabled wealth of New Spain. Hindsight is made out to be 20-20 vision, but it is not if it prevents one from understanding how things were and how they were perceived at the time. In this way, our knowledge of what was then the future can impede our understanding of the past."
4,Good Book,"I had a choice of about 50 books i had to read for school. Of all of them, i chose this one. I choose it because it was a book that i though wouldn't be boring. I was mostly right. Some parts of the book bored me, but the rest didn't. About 95% of the book didn't. It graphically described the battles and the details leading up to them. If you want to learn about the Alamo, read this book"
1,Only read if you've read a better depiction,There are those who want to present both sides and then there are those who have an obvious agenda. This radical and inaccurate representation clearly was written by someone in the latter category.
3,"Ridiculous, but not boring","As chick-revenge-flicks go, this is certainly not the worst. But it's so darn ridiculous at points that i caught myself laughing out loud. An example, you ask? Well, how about if a carjacked woman manages to get her son out of danger, by hiding him among other school kids at a truck stop. Smart, you think. But then a sheriff's deputy later tells the mom that her son is being turned over to social services, because she ""abandoned"" the boy at the truck stop! Oh, there's more! She gets a chance to call 911, but accidentally hits 411 instead!This film leaves common sense in the rear view mirror."
5,Excellent,"I know some people have complained about the first two seasons being a six cd collection in a bulky pack, but you can see it in the picture. Cant buy it anywhere else anyway, so very happy. Great, quick,uncomplicated service. Definately recommend if you like this show!"
4,7th Heaven:The Complete Series,I received all 11 seasons just like I wanted and they were all new still in the plastic. Some scenes were taken out and seasons 3 and 11 are scratched which are all disappointments but the episodes are still good.
3,Infinity curling iron,"Very disappointed. The item I received was not the ""Nano"" blue curling iron. It was the plain Infinity black that I already have. They did not send me the correct item that was ordered. So basically the seller did a bait and switch from the item advertised. The Nano is a newer version."
5,Favorite Curling Iron,This is my favorite curling iron. I have hair a little passed my shoulders and this gives me big pretty curls with lots of volume. The clamp holds the hair pretty tight without creasing. The only thing I would change is the power button location. I accidentally turn it off every time and don't notice until I realize my hair isn't curling. Other than that.... Love it!
1,Curling Iron?,"I tried this curling iron the same day I got it. I was so disappointed that it did not work for me. I was expecting it to at least give me big waves...my hair comes out straight with a curl at the end. What the? My flat iron gives me better curls than this...the only reason why I got this curling iron is because I keep burning my fingers when I use my flat iron to curl my hair. Needless to say, I'm returning it tomorrow."
2,not great,i purchased this item b/c of all the great reviews but i didn't like this product. the curling iron made my hair oily and the curls completely feel out in a 1/2 hour.
4,It's great,I love this one. Perfect curls and it doesn't burn your hair. I dye my hair a lot and this curling iron still keeps it healthy.
4,Curling Iron Calms Frizzy Hair,I love this curling iron. My hair is wild after washing. The iron calms it down and makes it soft and shiny looking.
2,Poor Design,"Although this iron does heat up very quickly and does grip your hair very well, there are issues. The cool tip is far too short (or far too heat-conductive), and thus heats up...which means sore, burned fingers. The clamping power of the iron is great -- hair doesn't slip out, even to thin ends -- BUT the price you will pay for that is weird, straight crimp lines every couple of inches in the curl. It's just TOO tight. Also, the on-off button is badly placed, and I have to watch constantly because it's very easy to accidentally turn it off. A beep would be nice -- other irons have a beep feature for on/off; with a design this poor, a beep should have been included. Also, when it turns off, you have to adjust the heat back up to the temperature you want, so it's a two to four step process every time you accidentally shut it off.I give it two stars only because of how fast it heats up and how smooth the surface of the barrel is. Otherwise I'd rate it a one star for the mid-curl crimps."
1,Amazon.com who?,"Do not purchase anything through Amazon.com that it is not being sold directly by them. If your purchase is broken/damaged, they will not help you with the vendor. Their policy is: ""We are not the Seller""."
5,Sony DAVFX-900W Rcommended System,"PROS: Excellent System appearance wise. Sound Ratings on a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10. Lives up to the Sony name by delivering excellent sound, and the features that go with it.CONS: Hookup can be somewhat confusing and instructions for hookup could be structured better. Explanations for proper hookup does not go into enough detail for using correct cables, and/or which setup should be used. Hookup for AM and FM radio very cheaply made which causes pause for the Sony name, by not being what is expected by the Sony brand."
5,Worth every penny on the price I have paid,I have got this product for 440 + free shipping from Amazon for last thanksgiving. It's still rocking. I would strongly recommend this. Some thing to be considered before you buy:1)It's just 1080i2)The receiver+DVD player is heavy3) Setting up is not too easy4) Hard to find volume control for sub woofer5) Disc loading is very confusing until you find the correct rhythm
4,"Works, but with some issues.","I am appreciative of how cheap these are, as I still use my Kyocera as an alarm clock. I also use a wall-to-car charger adapter for it. Unfortunately, the plug that goes into the phone is easy to bend if you accidentally knock it off the table while it is charging, and I believe the first one of these I bought did not work at all. Thankfully, two is still only about $10 shipped and that's hard to beat!"
4,"Blended as only ""The Maestro"" could do!","Surprisingly, this should have been the one that catapulted White back into the forefront of R & B. That honor would be bestowed, however, to the follow-up release ""The Icon is Love.""Regardless, though, ""Put Me in Your Mix"" is characteristically Barry: heavy on the sexual connotations and heavy background orchestral arrangements featuring the patented sultry strings that so permeate his music. The first cut ""Let's Get Busy"" sets the tone for the delights to follow.And there are many!! From the throbbing ""For Real Chill"" to the reworking of the classic ""Volare'"" to the title cut with its classic line ""I can make your toenails curl,"" White captivates like no other vocalist.A double pleasure is the pairing of White with fellow bass Isaac Hayes on the ten-minute plus ""Dark and Lovely (You Over There)"".WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THAT ONE WHERE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS PROMOTED!"
1,BEWARE! carcinogenic product!,"Beware that the ingredients for this product have recently changed and they added sodium benzoate, which can become carcinogenic when mixed with Vit C (it converts to Benzene). Since most of us take Vit C in some form or another (think fruits, juices, etc), do not take this warning lightly!Note that Coke recently removed this same ingredient, although they'll never admit it was because of this.For more information, please research in Google what Sodium Benzoate is and how it can become harmful.Do not buy this product, read the ingredients and demand a clean product."
5,Great health product,"Very efficient in receiving this product in good condition, have ordered several times and really helps oxygen in your lungs etc...great product."
1,HEARTBURN,I suffer from Systemic Candida.The Oxyden Elements Max did nothing good for me.It's disappointing because this product is so EXPENSIVE.0 stars
5,"Every ""old folk"" should see this...","When I first saw this film on video, I decided to rent a video player and visit my elderly parents...and they never had such a good time.My folks are gone now, and my stubborn dad, who hated practically everything, laughed is butt off. He hated movies, in general, but his reaction to ""Cocoon"" was gratifyting to me. I could analyze many aspects of the film, but there's little to say, other than the fact that the actors were in touch with their material and ran with it. Ron Howard made a more important film than he may know. To me, anyway... Every old folk should see this film."
5,Arrived Swiftly,I was very pleased this item arrived so swiftly. My grandson so loves this tape I hope to order him more from this seller because I loved how quickly this seller sent my purchase.
1,The Dumb Dinosaur,"If you wish your child to become a senseless zombie then this video is very good! Otherwise, you may want to get a video in which children are tought how anything works. It would be even better if the irrational songs had any hope of entretaining the child while providing information as opposed to transforming them into parrots."
1,(...),"I occasionally listen to Adam and Drew's radio show, but not as much as I used to. Their schtick gets pretty tiresome after a few months. This book, which I picked up at a used bookstore for $1.50, collects many of their best-known routines. If you have some kind of adolescent crush on either of these guys, you might like it. It's really nothing more than a quickie production carelessly thrown together to make quick buck off Loveline's silly teenaged fans. If, however, you are looking for some useful medical information that's intelligently written and coherently put together...well, you are sh*t out of luck here. Eventually, Adam and Drew's fans grow up and move out into the real world and discover that life is a little more complicated than the crude ideas purveyed by these smug, immature entertainers."
5,Awesome!,"Once again, Dr. Drew has informed and Adam has made the jokes. This book gave me so much info that I was too embarrassed to aske about. It was a lifesaver! If you are a fan of Loveline, you have to get this book!"
1,"bad design, poor customer service","We got this blender in August 2005. You need to use a ""measuring cup"" to clean the blade. The measuring cup is made of plastic. It is not strong enough to do the job, and broke after a few uses. We ordered a replacement part in August 2005 and it has not arrived yet as of January 2006! They charged our credit card at the time of the order. The customer service lady said, ""Since it is a new product, they don't have parts ready yet. It will be ready at the end of Feburuary."" We need to wait to clean our blender for half a year? At this point, I guess we have no other choice. We hope it won't break again if we could get the part in March. I have to say the blender works fine, but do you want to buy a blender you can't really clean for 6 months? With such poor product support, I don't recommend this company's products, especially this blender."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This product is cheaply made. When it was delivered, it was in a non-descript brown box with a small piece of paper that gave instructions for how to put it together. I guess it does what I needed, which is to display important papers on the wall, but I don't have confidence that it will last long."
2,The best thing about it is the price.,"As other people have noted, the sheath is worthless. It doesn't even seem to be made specifically for this knife. I'll be making a more durable one from card stock, duct tape, and truck bedliner spray. As for the knife, well, it's ok, but still only a three-star rating for it. I don't have big ape paws, but the handle on it is still too small. In a fencing-style grip, the pommel stud digs into the heel of my palm. The design of the blade shape leaves a full inch of blade from the hilt unsharpened, so it's effectively a 3.75"" blade with a bit of extension, especially if you like to grip it with your thumb on top of the blade. A much better choice for only around $30 is theCold Steel Kobun Black Kraton Handle. You'll get a much better knife with a more usable blade and handle, and a sheath that the knife won't pierce when you insert it."
3,Boot knife,Purchased this knife. Out of the box it was very sharp. Only downfall I see is the leather holder that comes with the knife is not very secure. The snap goes across the knife handle instead of over the top of it. Otherwise very happy with this purchase.
3,Not my favorite,"Knife is pretty good but for the price I have done better. Sheath is lousy, the clasp is not tight enough to hold knife in."
3,Good for the price.,"This is a medium quality knife. I bought it just to add to my collection.It is full-tang with a textured rubber grip. It's very lightweight. The scabbard is nylon. It has a very slim profile which makes it ideal for a boot knife, but the slim design feels loose in my hand and it doesn't have much of a hilt. I'll reserve it for slicing only."
4,McGarrigle Magic,"This dvd gave endless pleasure to watch....being a BIG fan of both the McGarrigles and Loudon Wainwright, it was nothing short of compulsory viewing!! The extra features are nice with both Kate and Anna offering insight into the whole family during their interview. I have the audio cd, so the package is complete!!!.....God Bless Kate and may her memory live on. As Loudon Wainwright accepted his Grammy recently for a latest release, it was appropriate for him to pay tribute to Kate, his ex, for teaching him how to frail on banjo!!! All in all, a joyous concert to watch on dvd.....I only wish I'd been sitting in the audience on one of the lounge chairs at front of stage!!!"
5,Adirondack Ghosts II,"This book was just steeped in local history. Since I live near several of the locations mentioned, I had the advantage to visit these cites. This book reallybrought many things to light."
5,Good product- needs some marketing!,"I did not know that this product existed until my EMT husband introduced me to it. Excellent at helping cuts heal- especially the kitchen knife cuts where you looked away for a second to speak to a guest and give yourself a nasty slice. Lasts, great adhesive and keeps the water out. Minimizes scarring. Downside- expensive and I wish it came in smaller sizes. I have tried to cut it down to size but it doesn't cooperate very well. If you buy one box it will last a really long time unless you are more clumsy than I am."
3,Not the best one out there,"I bought this out of necessity when my skin was so cracked it was bleeding in addition to its normal flaking (gross, I know). This is a very very ""heavy"" feeling product, I felt like my skin was being coated in a glycerin shell- which I hate. BUT I have to give it credit because when I applied it right after a shower (to lock in moisture, then I could go the day without much flaking. Eventually my skin healed enough that the crack went away. I wouldn't say that it's due to this product though. I don't feel like it was active in healing my skin, just prevented it from getting worse. In my opinion, the normal non intensive Curel is a better general moisturizer, or even other lotions such as Lubriderm. This is good to help with major cracks by sealing the skin more against the environment though."
5,US NAVAL AVIATION,"This book was purchased as a high school grad present to family member going into Navy soon. A book on navy planes was requested, and I found this book through Amazon-not only does the book have EXACTLY what we wanted, but cover presentation made a great gift."
5,Two Words - RIGHT ON !!,This is a close to perfect book. I was able to use this book to roll out a 300 seat Windows 2000 client/server environment. I now use it to refine my environment and to conduct regular administration. RIGHT ON !!!
1,Bad Quality,"I buy this Series because I love this kind of stories. The series is excellent but I did not have a chance of seeing it when I buy it, big mistake. I begin to see it during this summer and to my surprise I was not able to see some of the chapter I though is was my dvd so I buy a new one, and still have the same problem. Then I decided to move forward because it was too late to return it. The other chaptes, almost 3 to 4 were imposible to see because they look like when is raining and your are trying to see your cable or dish programs. So if you buy them be sure to see them before your returning time expires."
2,Disks were defective,"Some episodes played through, but others were glitchy. In some cases, you could not play through the episode. It would stop and you could not fast forward to get past the glitch. The disks appeared sort of transparent. You could see the print on the other side through the playing side. I don't know if that was the problem. I returned this item and received a full refund, which I do appreciate."
5,Terrific Series,"I ordered this complete series from Amazon. This set consisted of new DVD's, not used. I was concerned because of several reviews that said there were problems with the disks. However, I had none of those problems. They were new, were not scratched, and none of them were mislabeled. One DVD had a slight chip on the edge, but it did not effect the viewing. I watched the complete series and it is a magnificient saga with beautiful sets and costumes. If this period of history fascinates you, it is a worthwhile purchase."
1,4th disc 2nd season doesn't work!,"Don't order this until the DVD manufacturer can figure out how to make DVDs that work. I was very disappointed to find that the 4th disc of the 2nd season won't play on my DVD player, my computer, or my PS3. I had gone on here to order the series previously and Amazon had a note come up that they had suspended sales of the series until a glitch was worked out. When I went on to check on it, they had the series available so I thought the issue had been resolved. I was very disappointed to discover otherwise..."
4,The Tudors,"My only wish is that they had not put so much sex in this series. I wanted to know more of the politics, people, and history of the time. The sex ruined some of the story for me as it seemed so prevalent. The time of the Tudors was an intense, colorful period with interesting characters and situations. By the end of the series I was tired of looking at bouncing bare buttocks and felt they missed the mark by including nudity at the cost of what could have been a good story told well. I felt that Jonathan Rhys Meyers did a very good job, but he was miscast. Henry VIII was a redhead and very tall. He filled up the room with his commanding stature. Why they didn't have Steven Waddington, who portrayed the Duke of Buckingham, play Henry is a mystery. I recommend Henry VIII with Ray Winstone and Helena Bonham Carter."
5,"A two in one, great show and sexy men.",LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! Started watching this show when it first came on Showtime and got addicted to it. Now with box set I am addicted to it again. This is the first show that discovered the sexy Henry Cavill and second time seeing Jonathan Rhys Meyers.
1,not worth the money,Every single DVD skips and the collection is completely unable to be watched. This was a total waste of money.
5,Great show,I love this show an I always have. The actors portrayed their roles wonderfully! And buying this entire series made me so happy that I have watched it through since I got it!
5,Long live the Tudors,The Tudors series is wonderful television. I have read widely of the Tudor history so I am in on the details. The set is also beautifully packaged.
3,The Tudors (the complete series),"I bought this series in its entirety for my mother as a Christmas gift. She had watched the series on Showtime, rented it on Netflix and still wanted to own and watch it again. She is a Tudor history buff and she had enjoyed every minute of the series. The dialogue is rich, costumes and settings sumptuous and the story engrossing. She is 84 years old and also used the closed captioning whenever she watched it. Although the discs do have have a closed caption selection under the language/audio settings the cursor automatically skips over it. When we try to get closed caption through her dvd/tv we get a message saying there are no closed captions. This was a huge disappointment. I don't know if it is a defect and there does not seem to be a way to contact anyone other than to return the series to Amazon. I went online and discovered that other people had encountered the same problem.The Tudors: The Complete Series"
1,Three hour toothpaste ad,"The movie in absolute fantasy - one of the most tawdry and shallow products of Indian cinema - by the vapid, for the vapid, of the vapid."
2,Ok for the library,"Bollywood never ceases to amaze me; this is one of those movies where most Westerners (or anybody who doesn't know Indian Cinema) get the wrong idea, because Bollywood is a love or hate relationship kind of deal. I was disappointed with this movie, while it is very very long, it offers an enjoyable 'white love' concept, and the family is always first message, and we all have our duties reminder; but it ends to be too childish, silly, and unfortunately, Madhuri doesn't dance to the extent of her abilities. One thing I liked is seeing Salman so dark! was he suntanned or what? Also... what's up with the excessive slapping?"
3,A lot of mind in one movie,"Neil Patrick Harris? Matthew Lillard? How come I've never heard of this one? Hmmmm. Well, I don't think either of them will be putting this on their resumes, as if they really needed to fill them up anyway! But Gabriel Olds wasn't too bad, reminds me of Jared Leto. The movie is crammed with social commentary, something the director wants to expand upon, but can't decide whether it be on the disfunctional school system, family and teen angst, or satan. But he does give you a lot to think about. At least he didnt sell out and wrap it all up with a happy face. Not bad, but a little sloppy. Lillard need to quit playing the psycotic teenager, we've seen it before, and better in SCREAM. But he's great at spitting while acting. Harris, well, he's Harris, can't stretch it that much. I actually liked it, even though most wont. Its a harsh movie, but bareable."
4,Better than expected,"A very dark, sad story about a misunderstood genius becoming the victim of the anti-drug witch-hunt taking shape in America today. Spectacular job by the writer(s) showing the absurdity of classifying ALL drug users into one group. Enjoyable cameo by my favorite fiends. Will definitely be a purchase once the price goes down or I switch to DVD. (side note)- If you're looking for Malcolm McDowell in a jock-strap, you won't find it here."
2,Animal Room,"This movie could have been better, if they'd only have focused on every aspect of the Matthew Lillard's character. The audience is fed too many useless visuals. The dialogue is very weak and at times awkward.Through all of it, Matthew Lillard still manages to pull off a brilliant performance. The other actors outside of his clique seem confused, static and incomplete. They should have just shaved it down to one aspect, the one aspect people were interested in. Neil Patrick Harris' character was not one that most people are interested in. However it has beautiful cinematography, that just doesn't make up for the weak plot. It's less clockwork orange and more 90's wanna be pop culture cinema art."
5,Perry Mason Season 5 Vol.2,Very excited about this latest release. I only wish that the future releases would come faster. There are a few more seasons to go. CBS does a great job on the audio and video quality for shows that were produced more then 50 years ago.
3,PERRY FAN,Disappointed the stories are not very good. I think Perry is tired of the show. I don't think I'll be ordering anymore from the TV series.
2,Nonage redux,"Janowacki's review covers this book quite well; I'll merely note that I reverse his opinion of the story and the writing. I found the ending quite gripping, and the portrayal of the self-possessed protagonist is almost worthy of Sabatini after he mastered his craft. But the story is remarkably un-Sabatini-esque. Very little actually happens, and even less is done by the hero; perhaps Sabatini had been a little too influenced by Hamlet..."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible Copy","I own a VCR copy of this movie and anxiously awaited its transfer to DVD format, as this is one of my all time favorites. Big diappointment! My DVD copy is no better than my VCR copy. Great movie, great cast, lousy copy."
2,Terrible print,"Bought this since this is the only way to have this on disk. The print is terrible. It looks like it was taken from a VHS tape. As I have seen this on one of the Hi Def channels through DirecTV, I know that there is a very good Hi Def print with a 16:9 aspect out there. Warner Bros. has no excuse in releasing this movie with such an awful transfer.Wait for them to get it right."
5,"Re: ""Who is Killing the Great Chefs Of Europe""?","I didn't realize the popularity of this wonderful classic. I found it in VHS on Amazon and read so many inquiries about it. We all want to know if it will ever be put on DVD? I hope so as VHS players are no longer being produced and after ours are no longer working, what then? Can anyone let me know if this film will ever be on DVD? Hope so."
5,Excellent Movie,"I saw this movie in 1972 at the movie theater. Have always wanted to own it and have been telling my husband about it for years. Finally, I bit the bullet and ordered it. He enjoyed it as much as I did...it was just as terrific of a movie as it was when I first saw it in 1972. If you like good cuisine, beautiful scenery and interesting cities andgreat acting jobs, you will LOVE this movie! It's as fresh today as it was when it was made."
4,Chef Humor!,"With all of the wonderful ""chef"" programs on tv these days, I had forgotten about this 'old' comedy from years ago. We enjoyed it once again and the food looked delicious too! Enjoy!!!"
3,Index is useless,"The book is pretty good for swing. The index is to general to be useful. It works better as a 'read through' book, rather than a reference book that you can use the index to look up tips. For example, if you decide to look up some uses of JDesktopPane, the index simply lists all the pages talking about JDesktopPane, it does not list any sub-headings for the topic. Other than the useless index, I like the book."
3,Not much new,I was a little disappointed in the book. The material is pretty much the same as so many other books already covered. . It is a book that could be helpful for a beginner that has not done any research on the subject. I found the writing style not captivating and had a hard time staying focused.
1,Totally dated - don't waste your money.,This books is completely dated. It was not even worth the $0.40 plus shipping that I paid for it. It should be retired. It was like going back in time.
2,Not for anyone with food/weight issues,"This book contains pretty good, though very basic information. I don't think she really adds anything new to the discussion. I think you can find all the information in this book in many other sources.I would not recommend for anyone with weight issues. It appears that the author has never had to struggle with weight; and has very limited ideas regarding the ability of women who are overweight to exercise."
4,Running Sets a Standard,"This is a wonderful book to read. I happen to know some background information about the author; a women to set world records and goals for women area. K.S. was the first women to ever complete the Boston Marathon and it wasn't easy for her. Reading her book has gave me the strength, energy, and impulsion to start my dream of running and walking. Thanks to her, my dream now seems more real and in reach. Just one step at a time, one foot in front of the other..."
2,huge disappointment,I've had this for 6 months; and it just died. Some of the $2 chargers lasted longer than that. I was hoping for at least a year.
5,FUNDAMENTAL HARDCORE PUNK !,"A proper, complete collection of all of the Clay years singles,remastered at last ! The sound is so good any of these songs sounds miles better than the remaster of their debut lp CBABRats This is the legendary Leather,Bristles,Studs And Acne EP+ all of the 7'' and 12''s. All tracks are punk rock anthems on their own. Some instant classics here, like the immediately recognizable Race Against Time, Big Women, Sick Boy and so many others. The Do What you Do-concrete mix is outta this world.Want totry GBH ?.This is the best starting point,period. 62'of pure, undiluted, angry/catchy streetpunk/speedcore. Their best early material by far IMHO."
3,It's ok,"Been using for a coupe of months and I don't know that it's really working, I really haven't seen improvement and would probably not purchase again."
5,ballin,"I bought these shoes my freshman year in high school and wore them my freshman, sophomoer and half of my junior year. Not because I'm cheap but because they were the best basketball shoes I've ever worn. Great sole support and ankle support. Extremely comfortable to wear and breathe well. Great grip and lightweight. Awesome shoes."
4,Solid performer with lots of features,"Lots of useful features sold me on this machine over Dell or Compaq - built-in CDRW and network connection are great. I can pull files off my old desktop unit and burn them to CD. The DVD drive is great. I was shocked by the quality of the picture. It is great. Of course, the sound isn't the best. Good price, too."
2,Xmen + Anime = not so good.,"I've been contemplating buying this for a while now and finally went through with it. I read all the mixed reviews so I figured everyone has there own opinion so ill give it the benefit of the doubt. Boy was I wrong, This was entirely boring aside from a few good action/animation sequences. 5-6 episodes would have been enough. They could have cut out a lot of the filler in the middle. I often found myself daydreaming in the middle of episodes."
3,Cheap but works.,"I had a previous key fob for my 2001 alero but needed another one so I could have two. I got the item programmed by the dealer and everything works great. After dropping it one time, the plastic cracked and broke into 3 pieces. I dropped my current one I have that I got when I bought the car a hundred one times and it has not cracked or chipped once. After comparing the two I noticed the plastic from the new one was really cheap."
1,Not a Barber tool,This is more of a makeup brush than a proper neck duster. I'll be dumping this and getting the real deal next time.
5,A MUST READ for public relations and publicity,"I highly recommend this book. I found it an easy read, to the point and full of precise examples.The author describes each point, explains them simply and uses real news story situations from his past to enforce each point. The chapeters wrap up with bullet points to remember.I recommend it for PR reps, public information officers and anyone in the non-profit sector. Anyone in fund raising, school athletic booster clubs or public project may consider this book helpful.I am in the newspaper business but wanting to get into the public relations and public information field, so I had interest in this subject for many reasons. I was only three chapters into this book when I ordered one for my daughter, who is in the non-profit field and heads many fund raisers and deals with the media and public on a daily basis."
5,Revolution on a disc,"Reading about rock music has always seemed somewhat incongruous. Traditional music rags have always put a filter between the reader and the music, but those days are over. Now with this new DVD music mag you get to meet your favorite bands in their own words and music without relying on some rock critic's jaded prose. Meet Beck, shot in stunning black and white, interviewed by the ultimate interviewing machine - a Hal-like computer - as he gives a glimpse into his twisted artistic ways. Spend some time with Dayton, Ohio's most prolific export Guided by Voices as they make a convincing case of the benefits of being a big fish in a small pond. Hang out with the Cardigans as they learn to bowl ... These are the kind of intimate artist profiles you just won't find anywhere else. And then there's the videos, the alternate tracks ... the insane clarity of it all. The future is now."
5,Soul Stirring,"The first time I heard ""Put Your Lights on"" I felt shivers down my spine. Everlast has a voice that speaks to your soul. His voice is throaty and unique. The music that Santana plays makes you not only hear the song, but feel the song. The combination of Santana's playing and Everlast's voice is magical. This song makes you want to stand close to that someone special and dance. The music makes you want to move your body and feel the raw emotion that is in you. For anyone who likes their music to move them physically and emotionally, this is the song for you!!"
4,Great,As Expected. Fit and size are correct. Addias socks always hold up through several seasons for my kids. Size XS fits kids size 13 shoe.
1,From Unoriginal to Kindling,The only reason anyone should read this book is because its mandatory for a class. Its a pedestrian rehash of ideas found in other books. It offers no personality that would make it vaguely palatable and its filled with jargon in an attempt to convince the reader of how learned the authors are without offering meaningful ideas.
3,it's ok.,"bought it for class not realizing they weren't the original stories, my mistake. book is kind of childish but would be ok for a tween reader."
5,We love this book!,"I bought this to read aloud to my kids. We absolutely cherish it. Each story is richly told with full, fascinating description, and simile as only the Arab style can do. Sometimes we stop and reread a paragraph just to savor the beautiful words. This is a book for families to appreciate together."
5,Muy buen producto!!,El producto llegó en perfectas condiciones y funciona de maravilla!! Lo recomiendo ampliamente!!! Nada malo que destacar!! tengo una buena experiencia de compra con esta marca!!
3,The 80's called and want their tapes back,"The product works, its just whether or not you want to deal with TAPES. The price fits this product, but do you really want to keep buying tapes when you can just delete a hard drive and start fresh? I sent this back and the panasonic camcorder as well. Do yourself a favor and buy a DIGITAL camcorder, it will save you money and you will enjoy it more."
5,You can FEEL the blood flowing through his penises! :--),"Seriously though. I have never seen such amazing penises!! I came across a show of Jean Cocteau work at a museum in Montreal in 2004. I was not familiar with him, but immediately fell in love. Homoerotic drawings are just one type of his works, but I must say, the realism in these drawings is just phenomenal..."
2,Sing and Learn French,I found I needed to alter the vocabulary of the songs I used and some of the music was not so appealing. Useful as reference.
1,Ick,"This is really sad.Here we have the beloved He-Man/She-Ra series turned into a christmas special, and they have to incorporate dopey kids (kids in animation are always DUMB). Plus, to squeeze Skeletor and Hordak in, they made Skeletor a good guy!A disgrace..."
3,OK!,"It's not the best Christmas cartoon but it's not that bad either, the main problem I have with He-Man/She-Ra Christmas Special is that it's just a little to commercial but other than that it was ok and the story itself was kind of cute and the fact that my nephew loves this Christmas special and it really made him so happy than that's enough for me to give it at least 3 stars!"
1,Painful!,"The singer's voice and her rolling ""r's"" are absolutely painful...and so is the German!The CD deserves no star, just a swift kick in the garbage."
3,Solid Book,"This book does a very nice job of outlining the interview process as well as all of the issues around informed consent. The book also is excellent with the whole issue of developing a profile for the person being interviewed. This was probably one of the finer elements of Seidman's effort.I was disappointed with one thing. The reason I bought the book was that I was interested in reading more ideas on how to coalesce a number of interviews into a coherent whole. This was a weak area of the ""Interviewing as Qualitative Research..."" It was certainly addressed but Seidman's points related to this topic were not helpful. The book would, however, probably be helpful to someone that is just beginning to use interviews.Overall, it is a good book. It was just weak in the main area where I was hoping to pick up some new ways to approach the data."
3,Tottally cool babysitter!,My neighbor has a 6-month old son.I babysit it for her.This is a good carrier but it is really loose on me and even when I adjust it it is still loose so if you have a baby and you are going to get a babysitter to babysit for it I wouldn't get this carrier.But it is good quality tough for those who artenj't getting young babysitters like me.I am very mature for my age and I don't have any little or older brothers and sisters but i am a good sitter so I know these things.By the way my name is Rebecca.
4,Good Value,It was great to have extra bags handy as needed. I was pleased with the quality of this product. It is sturdy and worked well.
3,Not Made of Cloth,"I purchased these bags in hopes for the same type I bought from Sears in their stores--ones made of thick, high quality fabric. I was disappointed that they were not what I was expecting. Needless to say, I purchased multiple packages to save on shipping costs, because it cost the same amount to ship one package as it did to ship three. Doing it this way made each bag more cost effective, and now I don't have to think about buying them for a long time! If you are looking for the white, fabric-like bags, do not purchase these. They are a regular thin, paper vacuum cleaner bag."
1,Not HEPA,"These are cheap paper bags, not the HEPA cloth ones. They are also significantly smaller than the ""Kenmore Q - replaces 50557"" ones that I was replacing. Although the write-up and photo of the product on the Amazon site indicated that they were for 50557 and 50558 bags, the product that I received only says 5055 on the package."
2,Careful to get the right SKU,"Seller sent me a package of 3 bags not 9 as listed in description. The label on the bag matches the SKU in my order, although the photo and description clearly says 9. Please leave a comment if this happened to you as well."
4,"Fit Well, Priced Right","Replacement vacuum cleaner bags can be such a ripoff at retail. These bags fit well, work well and are priced right. Seems like an easy choice. Shipped fast."
2,Like a bad habit you can't break,"Why do I keep reading this series? The main character, Goldy, is getting increasingly, unbearably annoying. For the first few books I read she was okay, but now she's just so... whiny. And the way she deals with her son... That aside, the mystery portion of the book was decent, if a little over done. I'm not sure I buy a few of the ""key elements"" of the mystery, but, hey - it's fiction. I'll suspend a little disbelief, I guess. If you are a big fan of this series, I think you'd enjoy it. If not... this is not one of the books in the series that I would highly recommend."
2,Ignores forensic science,"Goldie is accussed on shooting The Jerk based on GSR (Gun Shot Residue) on her hands. However, it had been over eight hours since she fired her gun and she had repeatedly washed her hands in strong solvents. That would have made the GSR virtually useless. Without the GSR results, there would have been no story.After that snafu, everything falls apart in this book."
1,9/11 Fluff,Fluff piece on what Americans thought about 9/11 right after it happened before it was widely known to be an inside job. Who cares? Don't waste your time or money.
4,Only essential for fans and completists,"This is a nifty package, well mastered, but devoid of much in the way of pictures, liner notes (nice essay there though) etc. A definitive best of to be sure, but with many others out on the market I would think only new fans would find it worth picking up, older fans probably have a best of already.The remixes are, for the most part, unremarkable. Most have the taint of last year's ""electroclash"" movement and none come close to the remixes on say ""Love and Dancing."" Still, die hard fans such as myself will find some of them interesting, although none are classic remixes."
2,"Stick to a previous, cheaper compilation","Unless you can get this album at a decent, less expensive price, go for the previous compilation instead. Most of the remixes on here are nothing special and just follow the usual dance/DJ-remix formula, if you know what I mean."
1,Do not waste your money,This is one of the worst videos I have ever seen. Amateurish and poorly put together. The first 2 disks were defective and the few parts I could see seemed to me to be a disastrous attempt to prove a point.The last disk was better but also defective.
5,A Natural Way to Heal,"Growing up my father always drank different teas for almost any ailment he was having. He use to show me this book all the time. Back then I didn't really appreciate what he was sharing. But now I refer to this book faithfully. I am sipping on a cup of tea for my asthma right now. I think this book can give some good alternatives or helpful aids to people who don't really like taking over the counter meds. This has herbs that help from Headaches to boils to high blood pressure and many more. If you are interested in natural healing or just finding a good delightful tea to sip, this is the book for you."
1,Don't waste your money,"Battery life: 30 minutes doing nothingTech support says this is normal!What?YES, they say this is normal. Now I Know they have no sense.What can you possibly acomplish in 30 minutes on a laptop, assuming you are doing something productive. Forget about using this laptop in the airport.The poorest, most sorry, stupid, neanderthal tech support on the planet.Opposite of a Toyota product, wish they made a laptop."
2,VAIO are not good.,"I live in Japan and I decided to buy a Japanese computer. I went to the local computer store and bought a VAIO notebook. The first night I got it I had problems. It froze often. I really didnt think much of it. It also would say ""not enough memory....."" I bought more memory and it said the same thing. I would have to turn it off then back on. Sometimes it wont turn off. Then, files started to disapear until it could even boot up. I sent it off to sony to get fixed, but when it came back it was still messed up.My friend in college told me never buy a Sony computer I should have listened. He had a Sony and had problems with it. Sonys are eye candy for PCs. Buy an America comptuer."
1,"Um, no","I should have sent this back immediately. The utensil is thin and inexpensively made. It's too flexible, and don't think for a minute it's anywhere near the quality of an Oxo product, even though it's priced like one. It's a low quality product from China. And I don't mean that in a good way. The vendor clearly has no interest in generating customer goodwill or repeat buyers.To add insult to injury, they used a sticker on the back of the bowl that was inmpossible to remove without using GooGone. Come on, people. In this day and age? Use product stickers that can be removed, especially when we're talking about kitchen stuff.If you need a nylon spoon, go to your local supermarket and spend $3 on whatever they have in their kitchen aisle. You'll be better off. Or spend the extra money for an Oxo product. They're worth it."
2,Maybe This Christmas Tree is a bit better,"I have enjoyed the two other Mixes but this one is a little boring. I just bought ""Maybe This Christmas Tree,"" which has Death Cab For Cutie, Polyphonic Spree, Raveonettes, Pedro The Lion yadda yadda and I just think that holiday cd is much better."
5,The story BEHIND today's Middle East newspaper headlines,"This film tells the story of which too many modern minds remain totally and dangerously IGNORANT. Lawrence of Arabia relives the birth of modern day western intervention into the affairs of the Middle East. If one wishes to truly understand the ""Hatfields & McCoys"" relationship which has developed between the Muslim world and the western nations, then THIS, at the very LEAST, is how far back one MUST go.It is unsurpassed as an action film and a dramatic film, but also an educational film of incomparable value. It is history and essential viewing. The story that it tells CONTINUES to affect each and every one of us alive today.No lauditory words can do this film justice -- only viewing it with an open mind and clear understanding can do it any justice at all. Even if it were produced today, it would be regarded as a marvel of cinemategraphical accomplishment from every possible aspect. Today's films cannot touch it. It is a masterpiece."
3,This DVD of Lawrence of Arabia was purchased as a gift.,"This was a Christmas gift for someone else, so I really can not review it. I don't have a blu-ray player to do so anyway."
4,A sweeping biographical epic by David Lean,"David Lean's stunning cinematography and artful story tellilng keeps the viewer glued to the set, despite the length of the film. The life of T.E. Lawrence, who played a major role in the winning of the Middle Eastern campaign during World War I. Called a blasphemer for his optimistic and "" nothing is written ""view of life. His methods are often criticised and at some times he may appear to be almost hypocritical but he is, at heart, a good man and the film portrays this well. This is the epitome of the historical biography at its best as only David Lean can produce."
4,Region one or two?,"Most people looking at this review of Lawrence will have seen the movie in the cinema and probably own the VHS version. I would recommend to these people that they buy the DVD! Unlike most DVD's there appears to be nothing to choose between the region one and two versions. The outside package of region one is better but you then have to put up with the booklet being loose in the box, region two is not quite as well presented but the booklet and fly sheet are better presented. The film is superb and I would suggest viewing on a projection TV."
5,The best movie ever made,"This is, quite simply, the single best motion picture of all time -- and by a wide margin. There is LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and there is everything else. From the literate script to the outstanding acting and cinematography, it beats the competition in all respects."
5,Brilliant restoration,I have discovered this film... 45 years ago as a kid... I have always been a fan of it... For profesionnal reasons I went to Jordan and I went in the Wadi Rum... I spent a full night watching the film and all featurettes... I wish now to see it on a big screen a re release in the cinemas could be great. I really recommend to all Hollywood fans to buy this set. And not only for Peter O'Toole the great Omar Sharif has such a great role in this feature film. A definite must for all great cinema lovers...
4,"good movie, bad price","The movie gets 5 stars, the price gets 3 stars. For me, it's not good enough to justify paying $19 for it. My advice, look for it used"
2,Avoid Like The Plague,"Despite the sticker hailing ""all new digital restoration"" this edition is no different from previous offerings- all the edge enhancement is stilll there. Stick with the superbit version"
5,Lawrence of Arabia is a wonderful movie.,"Lawrence of Arabia is a wonderful interpretation of the adventurous life of Colonel T.E. Lawrence. The mixture of Peter O'Toole's wonderful British acting and Omar Sharif's exotic acting style is great. I'd recommend this movie to lovers of the classics like me, or people interested in the lives of the great men of WWI, and anybody else who wants to see a great movie."
5,LAWRENCE!!!!!!,Words cannot begin to define this film. Any attempt at such would be a horid injustice to all involved in such an epic. THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SEE IT! BUY IT! LIVE IT!Aaron Bartels
4,Great earbuds for the price.....,"Great earbuds for the price.....the mic isn't so great well at least it wasn't so good with my Sanyo M1, people couldn't hear me loud enough but it worked. The earbuds on the other hand were awesome!"
5,Super duper fast delivery but ridiculously bulky packaging,"These headphones are amazing! I currently use Sennheiser studio headphones for my Roland electronic drum kit and knew I could trust them to make a quality pair for my phone. The answer/disconnect button isn't compatable with my phone or something else is wrong, but it is still worth the money. I have received compliments on the microphone quality, especially in situations with obnoxious ambiant noise (e.g., Chicago's elevated El train).My biggest complaint. They were shipped in a box big enough for an Oxford dictionary; way unnecessarily large and wasteful. Company's need to help in the conservation of resources just as much as individual consumers do."
2,Promiced to match my needs perfectly BUT,the excellent sound came from only the left side and I dont think the mic worked either. My advice is to keep the packaging in case you have to return it. I did not and was out $50.
2,I was not impressed,"To be fair, I only had the phones for 1 day before I mailed them back. The mic did not work as another reviewer indicated. I have a Blacberry Pearl & read on some forums about these but I did not think the bass was good at all. I don't believe they were true stereo headphones--i don't know if this was same situation as previous reviewer noted where he had to pull out the connector slightly to hear true stereo, but that defeats the purpose of the purchase. I know per many forums that the Pearl has issues w/stereo, but should be overcome by headsets such as these b/c of their 2.5mm tips with 3 or more circles on the end. The box made them look cheap as well as I have seen a box of normal Sennheisers that cost more than these so immediately it got me thinking the quality was going to be that good. I guess I'm spoiled w/more higher end headphones, but b/c I've heard much about the name, I thought I couldn't go wrong. Will have to read on more types to see which ones I want"
4,ANGELA starring Sophia Loren,This movie is in English and stars Sophia Loren as a mother who's baby boy is kidnapped by gangsters. She searches for him endlessly. Years later she begins to come alive again after she meets a charming younger man. They fall in love and begin an affair .......then they discover that he is her son.
4,Stop the abuse,"Spiritual abuse is a rising trend among churches. This book will give you the knowledge on whether or not you are in a mentally, emotionally and/or oppressive church."
1,opinionated,I did not get past the first few chapters of this book. The author seemed to give his opinion of what is spiritual abuse without scripture to back it. It seemed to me to be much more cultural than scriptural. He seems to look at the Bible thru his culture rather than looking at changing the culture through the Bible. Too much psychology for me ( and I hold a counseling/psychology degree). The book is no longer on my shelves. I was looking for a purely scriptural approach and did not find it in this book. But if you want psychology with a lot of opinion then this is the book for you.
5,A book that reads like a biography of too many,"I chose this book upon the recommendation of a friend. As I began reading it, I began to see churches that I was familiar with described within its pages. My entire life has been spent in churches like these. No denomination is named; the abuse happens across the board.This is a very good choice for helping people who are stuck understand where they are and how to get out. This is an excellent resource for those who are counseling the spiritually abused.Every pastor across America should read this book and take heed."
4,OEM Lamp,"It's hard to tell in the reviews if they are actually applicable to the product or just generic for all et-lax100, including the ""compatible"" lamps. I did purchase the OEM Panasonic lamp (comes with new filter) and it has worked just fine to this point (1 1/2 months). I was tempted to buy one of the compatible lamps, but just couldn't make my self do it. Nothing to say about the lamp purchased except that it works as it should.One thing of note that a lot of people don't think about is that if buying this lamp as a backup to a working lamp, be sure to install the newly purchased lamp as soon as it arrives as the warranty is for 90 days from purchase, not installation. Seems counter-intuitive, but might as well make sure it isn't going to fail prematurely now, rather than after the warranty is gone."
1,BEWARE! This is NOT a genuine new replacement lamp!,"I had to return this lamp immediately upon receipt as it was clearly NOT a new lamp. The box it came in, which IS a ""genuine Panasonic"" box for this lamp, was NOT sealed closed; instead, the flaps were merely crisscrossed shut. The lamp unit was NOT in a sealed plastic bag. The lamp housing looked to be quite old/used. My guess is that this is a lamp that was stuck in a used housing. While the lamp itself did not appear to be used (I examined it with a magnifying glass), it is questionable as to who manufactured it and indeed who stuck it in this housing.This is completely unacceptable to pawn off such merchandise as new or genuine! The word FRAUD comes to mind."
2,Terrible.,This hat bends out of shape really easily. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it looks good when it's new.
2,It's OK,Hi!This CD is OK. The singer is very 'operatic' and not really accessible to my child. They don't include the lyrics so I can't sing along as I am not a native speaker of Spanish.I have other language/song CD's that I like a lot better.
1,Not worth getting this CD,"I was excited to get this CD however, once we got it I realized that the woman who sings all the songs is not a native spanish speaker and so the songs are not translated properly. For an added bonus, she has a TERRIBLE singing voice and makes us cringe when we listen to it. It is like the sound of music gone terribly wrong. It was a big waste of money and we will never listen to it again. Don't waste your money!"
4,All those words...,"(review title is tongue in cheek)If you've made to the 3rd book of this series, you're used to reading thick books and familiar with Mr. Stephenson's style. That said, it does seem like he likes to ""listen"" to himself...throughout the series, I occasionally find myself skipping pages of either letters or scenes which just don't feel (to me) like they're adding much to the story.I know after I'm finished (not there quite yet) I'll find myself craving for more, but that's a craving for more of the good parts, not the slow parts. This is just my US $0.02, still giving this book and the series 4 stars - really enjoyable, just not perfect."
5,Great end to the series,"For this whole trilogy, I really appreciated a technologist's approach to history. It is often kind of difficult to read historians and some literature masters delve into science, so I found it refreshing to read a science-focused author dive into the history of science, economics, market economy, etc. Would recommend for anyone who wants a better grasp of the root of our current world."
3,A fine journey that could have ended better,"I'm still decompressing from the 17th-18th century United Kingdom, Europe, the Americas, India, Japan, etc. Especially the vocabulary, which the author handles very well.I've giving it three stars because I got tired of some of the lengthy place descriptions and was disappointed with the ending of this book because it didn't bring us full circle back to the beginning of the first one. I'd have liked to hear more from Enoch Root, the cycle's Methuselah, and Daniel's young son Godfrey who, as one character (Eliza I think it was) says will carry Daniel's intellectual and scientific curiosity far into the future.Also, while I never doubted that Jack would not be shaft-o on the Treble Tree, a more direct telling of his survival would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, it was a fine journey through the development of Western science and world commerce. I will miss not having Jack and Eliza and the Natural Philosophers to return to day after day after day."
4,Good American Success story,"The book explained how Coors was one of the few breweries which succeeded out of hundreds a century ago. The foundation of its success is a dedication to quality. By using the finest ingredients and products, the drinker enjoys great taste as well as a good buzz. The Coors family made many critical mistakes, their ideals, right or wrong, set many people against them. They were slow to change with the times, for example they didn't promote their fine product effectively. The descrption of the Coors family members was often quite complete."
1,Step By Step to Insanity,"This book is useless as reference for coding, because the examples simply do not work. I have had to consult other books just to try to get the sample code in the book to work. What good is a programming text if you cannot refer to it when you want an example of how to code?"
5,More Than Meets The Eye,"A classic of jazz, the studio work of these 2 giants together in this mid to late 1950's period put forth some of the greatest sounding music ever layed down.Hawkinks the master,Webster,the sweet soul bluesman on these tracks are an amazing display of blues,and jazz with the great Oscar Peterson on piano.There are a whole slew of recordings done in this 1950's era for Verve comprising a similiar lineup of these stellar musicians and many are on the Veve master-editions issue...not to be missed for those exploring are the Genius of Coleman Hawkins,Ben Webster and Associates,Ben Webster meets Oscar Peterson,Ben Webster's Soulville..these releases were all repackaged with liner notes and given great treatment..All of these ""senior"" masters were given their due late on in their careers but the greatness of their youth is revisited on this and the other fine releases."
5,Best album of the year,"This is honestly the best album of the year. They have so many hit singles on this album. This is an album that you can listen to all the way through. This is a perfect album. The only problem is though, it will be hard for them to make a second record and top this. This is a MUST!"
2,It was broken when I received it,When I received the package the tape inside was broken. I was very disappointed. I tried to order another but they are not available anymore.
3,Bought for my 5-year old,"I bought this game for my 5-year old for his birthday. He loves it! He is a Cars fanatic, so that helps, but he can run Lightning around & is figuring out the other games too. There aren't too many Wii games that he can play but this one is great for him."
2,"mediocre, at best","bought this game for me and the kids (4 and 5). it's too hard for them to play b/c you have to use two controllers. and it's pretty boring for me. if you're looking for a racing game, buy mario cart. 100 times better."
5,Powerful!,"This book is powerful. I could not put it down. I have read many Karen Kingsbury books, but there is something different and extraordinary about Divine. I prefer to read reviews, not leave them. But this book moved me."
3,Divine,"Though the truths of the word are all there I found this book's characters to be quite predictable. It was a fast read and never truly pulled me into the characters. It was very easy, probably good for a summer read for a teen."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I have read and really enjoyed all of Karen's books....until now. I don't know if I should review it since I didn't get past chapter four or five. It was so depressing, so graphic, so horrible, I couldn't continue to read it and I stopped. I realize it's a 'reality' type novel, but way too real for me. I read Christian novels to be encouraged and uplifted. I could find the stuff in this book [at least the part I read] on the news any night of the week, which is why I rarely watch the news anymore. I was very disappointed. I think I'll stick with Christian romance from other authors."
4,Great new book for individualized study of ear training,"This book is a required text for classes I teach at Laney College and at the Jazz school in Berkeley, Ca. It is a great book for beginners and intermediate students who wish to obtain computer assisted literature. The CD is very user friendly and works very well on both MAC and PC.(I have tried both.) The only draw back I have seen so far is the lack of study of modal scales in the first chapter. Other wise this is a very fine text and CDROM"
5,Great markers,"Markers are great! Easily washable from any surface! We don't yet use them a lot, as our child a bit too young for them, but he does have fun when we use them."
1,Gelatinous!,"This paint received was a gelatinous, unusable mess. Ruined a valentine project with my daughter. I even tried thinning it down to no avail, there were still nodules of red gooeyness. Very disappointing! It would proably cost me more to return in shipping, since it s a low-price item."
4,Women as historians,"An incredible book for mother's and daughter's to realize we must tell our daughter's not only our own family history so that future generations know where they come from and what they have endured. We also must tell our daughters the history of our country so they can pass on on what really accurs to the next generation, we need historiams for big events but we need mother's and daughter's to tell how these big events affect the common man."
1,crave injustice to Emily Bronte,"Why an author would suggest that you can jumble up the word order of a poet's output is beyond my keen. To parse, reverse, take in jumbled order a poem and ask me to spend my time trying to understand what the author is on about, while the poem, undisturbed and before my very eyes, reads so fine, smooth, deep and emotive. This author is smoking the drapes."
4,A rare find,"Beautiful classic Christophe, this album contains some of Christophe's best works and all the quintessential elements of his artistry - sweet, romantic melody, dynamic vocal and such superbly rich simplicity."
2,not what I thought,One size fits all? I'm a size 6-8 and these did not fit. They went around my hips but barely fit front to back - both cracks showed. The pocket that the vibrating piece fits in actually hits by rear area not my cl****us in front - not very stimulating back there. And the vibrator is really loud - not very discreet in public (unless it's a loud bar).
3,These panties are okay...,First off...The vibrator doesn't stay where it'll do the most good. (And I think everyone knows WHERE I mean?!) It slips down into the little pouch too far. Try to fix it with velcro I guess. And it vibrates a touch too loudly for my liking. But it's a fun item none the less. It was one of the cheapest prices I found for the quality.
1,Astrea Remote Vibrating Panty,"These are a novelty item. A gag gift. The panties are very cheaply made and definately not meant to be worn by a grown woman. Trust me, if there is a size smaller than small, this is it. Don't throw away your money unless you know these are just for fun and you are just looking for a few laughs."
2,didn't like,"Was not the same experience as in the movie ""the ugly truth"" at all. the vibrator is very loud, and i had to wiggle to a good position just to feel it. the vibrator itself is rather big. waste of my money."
1,One size fits all really fits petite only,This item is advertised as one size fits most. I am a size 8 woman and the panty is much too small.
1,Absolute junk!!!,"Don't waste your money, even as a novelty this thing sucks, if it took more then 5cents to make this item i would be surprised."
1,Missing Battery,"The battery for the remote control was missing. This is an A23 12V battery. Not something I would just have laying around the house. The panties said stretch to fit. Sorry, it did not stretch enough. No returns and no way to leave a comment about the missing battery other than this review."
4,Works Well,"When I went to buy this product I was a little worried about how it was going to work. My fears were vanquished when we first tried them. It is a little noisy, so public places where the ambient noise is low is not a good place. I recommend the movies or other places where the little noise it does make isn't easily audible."
3,Few information,"The book has a lot of makers and models, but few information about them. I'd rather to see fewer models and more information (including technical specs) about them."
1,Dont buy BOSE,"We have had nothing but trouble, freezing up, no sound, volume shutting off. We have contacted BOSE 8 times , with no relief DO NOT BUY A BOSE PRODUCT , you will be sorry. We have had 5 different ""software"" up date disks. Each one has worked for approx. 30 minutes to 1 hour and then we had to reload it. BOSE won't do a thing about it, they know its a problem but would rather take your money and field your phone calls, and string you along. Feel free to e-mail me if you want further info. If I can make BOSE loose 1 customer I will sleep alot better."
3,Bizarre but fun--okay for kids,"Eight faces in this book are cut into sections, and by flipping the sections back and forth, you can mix-and-match the features. The faces range from pleasant to silly to bizarre, and are really rather amusing. Unlike other customers who have reviewed this book, I would have no hesitation giving it to a young child. Even the grotesque drawings are clearly not serious--children have a better understanding of real and imaginary than they are given credit for--and because of the nature of the book, it is entirely up to the reader which faces and features are chosen... a very positive and liberating aspect. One thing I particularly like is that you get to see a front and side view of each face you've made. One thing I would have preferred to see is faces of different colors."
4,Hand massager,"A nice hand massager that is easy to operate and works on specific spots. I ordered it because of the warranty and that it doesn't have all sorts of functions; just on, with or without heated air coming out around the top. Has lot's of vibrations, but it would be nice if they were more intense in order to get deeper into the muscles. Had a positive experience with the seller."
5,My vet is so proud of us,"When we took our then-new bird in for a checkup and told our vet that we had already transitioned him from a seed-mix to his Roudybush she was so surprised and happy. She suggested we might supplement his diet (""his"" being our maroon-bellied conure) with some Nutriberries for fun, variety, foraging toys, and maybe a few extra calories (because he does tend to be a few grams underweight) - but Roudybush is hands-down the best food for birds. Their website has instructions for a few different ways to transition your bird onto this diet, but he had no problem with the first method we tried - namely, replacing his seeds with this 100% on the first day and seeing what happened.He was on colored Zupreem pellets for a little while before being on Roudybush and he didn't like them NEARLY as much as he likes this. Plus, the Zupreem made his poop turn rainbow colors that actually stained clothing purple, green, orange, yellow, reddish......nope, Roudybush is the winner here."
3,Briarpatch I Spy Memory Game,Not what I expected -- just a whole bunch of cards and lots of instructions for play. I would still recommend it as someone else may have different opinion.
4,Excellent for bringing you up to speed.,"If you're an experienced programmer just becoming acquainted with C#, this book is perfect. I found it very helpful in understanding the basics behind how C# works, and why it works the way it does.Another excellent benefit of this book is the effective presentation. I can take the code samples, the text, and build test applications to explore the new technologies. I especially enjoyed the level of detail with the discussions on the MSIL and how what I do is represented in the MSIL.Even if you're not an experienced developer, I highly recommend this book. It's not a step-by-step book by any means, but with a bit of work, you'll come to learn and appreciate what C# has to offer."
4,Another Great Product From Sony,I've owned this phone for 3 years now and haven't had any problems so far. The spare battery compartment on the phones base is a big help when I forget to charge my phone. The only draw back is that the answering machines digital voice recording makes both incoming and outgoing message sound garbbled.
5,Planet Joe,Great book. Made me laugh out loud multiple times. I wish he had had a chance to write more.
1,I HATE IT!!!,I don't like this book because the pieces aren't very good. The note on the pieces are also different.
2,Nothing Special,"This sheet set comes with two white sheets with NFL screen-printed on them. Only the pillowcase has the team logo and colors on it. Had I known that I would have just bought a pillowcase and some plain white sheets, the screen-printing took several washings before it wasn't uncomfortable against my skin. Honestly, this sheet set is a ripoff. If you really want a sheet set of your favorite team there are better ones out there."
2,Too much noise about nothing,"I purchased this album after reading all the comments... Well, I've been surprised to listen something so common. Perhaps nice to listen when you want to have a good rest but don't call it genious please."
5,Smiles All Around!,We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!
4,"A thoughtful exploration of ""Literary Drug Use""","Hayter's book, written in the sixties, opens up a new field of criticism, a new non-prudery about the material conditions of artistic production. It is extremely well-researched, finely balanced, carefully experimental, and, overall, a disciplined and well-written book. Important for anyone interested in Romantic studies; essential for anyone who still believes in the old trope of ""creative drug use""."
4,Interesting Story,I had to go to jail for possession and happened to come across this book in the library there. I found it impossible to put down once I started to read it. If you get a chance I suggest to anyone to give this book a chance.
5,Great tool,This is a handy little hammer to keep in the kitchen. It is also great for my daughters in their apartments. Everything you need in one place!
3,Good product,"Its what I expected, great for the office, use it all the time . Thank you.I highly recommend this product"
2,Simple not always better,"I have long relished the flavor of percolated coffee. Thought I would replace my automatic maker with a percolator. 'Disappointed' best describes my purchase so far, but I am hoping results will improve. I am still in the 'seasoning' phase of ownership, and likely ingesting metallic particulates from the pot. It may very well get better, but so far, the coffee is OFF. Not scorched, bitter, or horrible, etc, just 'off'. If i had to purchase another, I would get a plug-in percolator. The stove top takes too long, probably because this pot does not have a good heat-conducting, copper bottom like our Copco tea kettle has. Over-priced at $30 / $12 is more appropriate for what you get. Apparently, the nostalgia of percolating coffee pots adds to the price."
1,"Terrible, Leaked First Time","The first time I filled this with water it leaked from the bottom side. The quality assurance procedures for this product are in need of improvement. Returned to Amazon for refund.I previously owned a Farberware Yosemite stovetop percolator (see my five star review for it) and it lasted through daily use plus some for 14 months (the handle finally broke off). Nothing lasts forever, and I feel that I got my money's worth with it. Instead of ordering another one, I (like a dumb-dumb) tried this Copco percolator. Big mistake. I have since ordered another Farberware Yosemite from Amazon and have started using it. No problems. It is an excellent stovetop percolator and well worth the price."
1,Not worth buying,"Makes a good cup of coffee, but the lid will not stay on when pouring the coffee. It looks like the 'stainless steel' shrunk. Not worth the money...."
5,Great!,No one could tell stories like Wendy Bagwell. He was a great funny man and is greatly missed. I can sit and listen to him tell his funny stories for hours on end. Good stuff to listen to. No one can keep a frown on their face and listen to Wendy tell one of his stories. Try it! You'll see what I mean.
1,Unable to read video store dvds,"This machine was unable to load several dvds from my local video store. The same disks played on several other machines, so it was not a disk problem. On the plus side, one touch dubbing did work as advertised, but because of the inability to play commercially produced disks, I returned the machine. I've switched to a combination of a combo dvd/vcr player and a separate dedicated recorder (not Sony). Combined, they were only slightly more expensive than the single unit, and stacked, take up only slightly more space."
3,Choose the Compaq or Dell,"My cousins both owned a HP pavillion. One I only experienced from second hand. The first cousin's crashed. The second cousin's I was unable to fix, and I have been following computers for 2 years. Hers crashed once. She fixed it then wanted me to hook up DSL. As I was doing that the start menu started to malfunction. I do not know if it was a virus or the computer. If you are going to buy this computer, I suggest you go to the equivilant Compaq presario. The Hewlett Packards have a bad reputation, turning out sorta like the former ""Packard Bells"" (now extinct). For better quality, try the Dell or Compaq. However, if you find that the HP works for you, go get em."
5,Have a good giggle...,"Kim and Jason comics are refreshing and clever. This book is a great addition to your tool chest of stress busters. It will take you back to the good old days of kool-aid stains, Saturday morning cartoons and chronic bed head. Pure fun for boys and girls of any age! Pick one up now at an Amazon near you!"
1,Not Worth Your Money & Time to Buy it!,"What a piece of junk. The bristles are very thin, and unevenly cut. A few of them even fell out during shipping. The handle is crooked and it falls out as soon as you pick it up. It is because the small handle is not fixed (glued or nailed) into the shank, most likely to save even more on production costs. Nevertheless, it is proudly written with huge letters on the shank (Amazon is careful to show us only the other side): MADE IN CHINA. Well guys, I wouldn't be too proud if this is the best you can do when it comes to a simple brush. What a waste of resources to make this, and waste of money to buy it. Amazon, please stop selling junk. I am sending mine back today!"
3,You get what you pay for,"There are other vibrating thongs out there that cost a lot more. but if you are looking for something cheap this will provide you with some simple thrills. I bought it for my wife. She finds it more fun that arousing, but still it was fun."
1,This product is awful....,I was looking forward to receiving this item and thought it would be great. It is terrible - no power to it - very frustrating - useless
1,Trowing money away,"DEFINITELY NOT DISCREET OR SILENT. Once turned on, it vibrates nonstop. Definitely a waste of money. There are better options in the market that offer different patterns of stimulation and are not as noisy as this."
2,If you are a fan of liquorice,"I have recieved this as a gift from a friend. Truth be told, I am not fond of this perfume. I wore this to work yesterday and all I can smell is the anise in this perfume. The anise gives it the liquorice smell to it. I am debating if I should just hang on to it because the bottle is pretty cool looking and my friend gave it to me or give it away. I can't see myself using up a 4.2 ounce bottle of this anytime soon unless I use it as an air freshiner."
1,This book is bad,"I had to use this book in one of my classes, and it was really bad. It didn't do a good job of explaining anything and was really confusing. Alot of what they had to say seemed to be really out of date, and there were a bunch of technical errors."
5,What a programmer needs before programming languages,"I should have written this review years ago except that Internet was not much of a thing when I first read Pratt's book. If I am where I am today as a developer with multiple language skills, it is thanks to Pratt. His approach to introducing languages to a developer is unique - first the concepts followed by how various languages implement the concepts. Wirth's ""Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs"" approaches the same subject but from a different angle. I like Pratt's approach. If you want to be in the developer community, this is what you should read BEFORE you lay your hands on any programming book."
3,The 4th season is a little disappointing,"The first three seasons of this show were really much better than the fourth season. In the fourth season they have gone much moreinto speculation and sensationalism with much less real science.Still, it is interesting and worth watching, just don`t expect too much from it.Call it three and a half stars."
3,The universe,"This is like a sequel, not as good as the original. It is better than season three because some new ideas are explored but is not comparabe to season one and two."
5,enjoyable fantasy,very well done and shows an environment of a cloistered life. it is a fantasy storyline about young love in a structured family setting.
2,GREAT UNTIL THE END,MY HUSBAND AND I WERE REALLY ENJOYING THIS MOVIE... THEN IT ABRUPTLY ENDED LEAVING YOU TO DECIDE HOW SHE LED THE REST OF HER LIFE AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS WHICH WERE LEFT UNENDED (WHICH I WON'T MENTION IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO WATCH IT.) THIS MOVIE LEFT US WITH A CHEATED FEELING. UNTIL THE END WE REALLY LIKED IT VERY MUCH. :(
3,Surface Love,"Love is one of the most widely topics spoken on or about in any language. I saw hooks'title claiming to have a new vision on it, and was rather pleased. In total, however, this book is no different than most of the others I have read. According to hooks in the introduction: be it through practice or theory, we know very little of love. And I was expecting her to at least attempt to give us a working definition. None was provided. Nonetheless, chapter 3 is titled: Be True to Love. And this is only one of the countless wrong steps she took. Since, not only did chapter 1 not set any sort of formidable foundation, but so was two in inconsistency and shallowness. Bell hooks obviously did a lot of research, but it was more in quantity than quality in presentation. I felt like I was reading her droolings. She obviously bit off more than she could chew here. The last three to four chapters are the best ones. She started to get warm then. My grade is D+ bordering on a C-."
3,Intriguing,"Although this is an intriguing book, I feel that it has been historically over-rated. It seems more a series of vignettes describing in detail events of war (one could almost say pornographically but this is admittedly a little harsh). There are scenes of wounded horses screaming, a hospital with agonizing amputations, soldiers struggling in the mud... All of this seems there as pure description, almost like biographical journalistic anecdotes - and none are lengthy. The characters surrounding the first-person narrator, Paul, are superficial; the dialogue, at times, sophomoric.I found tenderness and emotion missing in this book. A better view of war is obtained by looking at the World War I paintings of Otto Dix. `For Whom the Bell Tolls' by Ernest Hemingway (although different) is far superior.However, there is one facet this novel does portray effectively - war will cause mental scars that will never heal. War permanently damages all participants."
4,A look into the youth of WWI Germany during warfare.,"This book is a psycological look into the minds and thoughts of the youth who mainly fought in the early 1900 war, World War I. It's main character, paul Baumer, goes through many mental stages during the war. Dealing with death, sicknes, and sometimes a little insanity. It also shows the bitter honesty of those who fought the war and the heroes who remembered it."
5,Great Book,"It was great read when I was in school, and it is sitll a great read now. Don't think I can't get rid of it."
4,All Quiet,All quiet gives you an in depth look at war and what it does to a person both physically and mentally. It starts out slow but picks up as you continue to read. Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone.
3,A Decent Book,"I really don't see why this is considered such a great novel. It has it's moments, but I really think it was kind of boring. I can understand any praise this book gets, but I found it to be a little bit dull. I don't think that high-school aged kids, such as myself will enjoy it."
5,A MUST READ,I personally think this book realistically depicted the war. The feelings after reading this book is undescribably touched; it helps you appreciate and treasure life more.
3,Could Have Been Better…,"I am a adult-level reader and LOVE reading, yet I coudn't get into this book. I probably would've quit after chapter 1 if it wasn't required reading for my history class.The author is very good at descriptions, and at times I felt as if I were right there beside the soldiers. But…SPOILERS AHEAD!!!There was no character growth throughout the novel. Paul maintained the same ideals and thoughts at the end of the novel that he had at the beginning. I'd expected some great revelation to happen, but it never came. And the end of the book was so depressing. I'm not a huge fan of sad endings. Also, Paul didn't have a motivation to return home at all. His world and thoughts seemed very bleak. Maybe that's a realistic portrayal of what war can do to a man, but I think it could've been so much more.God bless! -Romans 1:16-"
5,All Quiet On the Western front,One of the best war related books I have read = a classic. Good to hear something from the other side which shows the commonality of experiences
5,Depressing novel revealing a rich character...,"As a history buff, I find myself pulled towards the romantic side of war. Although my views are quite regularly blown away with each new wartime history that I read, few others did it so completely (""Iron Coffins"" by Herbert A. Werner is definitely on par with this book). ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" dissects a normal soldier (enemy soldier, depending on where you are on the globe) into a perfectly normal, emotional young man. You not only are able to see the terrible waste of life that epitomizes WWI as a whole, you also see one soldier's attempt at wading through the hell of war. It's amazing to think that a generation survived it, and that the world still goes on."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front,"This novel is an excellent story of a young man's forced growth into adulthood. Paul Baumer, the narrator, is a 20 year-old German soldier in World War I that enlisted right after high school. He sees his comrades fall from shrapnel, gas, bombs, and bullets, one by one. He is made to see the atrocities of war: the amputations, the loneliness, the fear, the anticipation, and the slow deaths. Paul often wonders of his own fate, and trys to remain clear-headed to save his life on the front.I chose this book from a list of about 20 titles, with only a faint knowledge of the story line. It was a gripping story, from the first chapter to the last, and held my attention right up to the end. I was able to identify with the narrator as he tried to maintain his sanity in a world of chaos, and how he tried to not forget his youth despite the forced maturity that comes with, in his case, being a soldier."
1,I couldn't listen to this tape,"I have wanted to read this book for a long time, but I didn't have time, so I bought the audio tapes. I put the first one in and it broke right away. I didn't even get to listen to one sentence. What a waste of money!!"
3,all quiet on the western front,"I thought this was a good book, it started out kind of slow, but by the third or fourth chapter it really picked up, it told a good story of world war 1, a side of the story I had never heard before, I would recommend this book to other people."
5,one of the greatest books ever,I feel that this is on of the best books that has ever been writen about war. It is about a young man who changes during the first world war. I thik that this book tells what really happens to a person during a war. The book has a great message. I hope that every one has a chance to read this book.
1,MISREPRESENTED EDITION,This is an ABRIDGED VERSION as well as a bad translation! Nowhere in the sales link does it say Abridged. I'm sending it back! DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION if you want the real novel.
1,Franz Kafka meets Dr. Seuss,"I read this book to my daughter once, then I threw it out. We have some other books by Perkins, and they are nice. But I found this one to be terrible.The dog is taken home from the pet shop, where he is not happy, by a little boy. The dog is something of an outsider among the neighborhood dogs because he can't dig. He then gets the knack of digging, and finds himself ostracized _because he digs too much_. At one point, the little boy actually threatens to return the dog to the loathsome pet shop!The plot's focus on ostracism, and the implicit theme of conformity, are bad. Just wrong for little kids.If you want to get one of Perkins's books, get ""I'll Teach My Dog 100 Words""."
1,Cute picture belies content of book,"The moral of this story is that if you make a mistake, you will be punished. The dog in the story is adopted from the pound by a seemingly sweet boy. When the dog can't dig like the other dogs, the boy is sad so the dog learns to dig. He digs and digs and digs up things he shouldn't. The boy is mad and tells the dog he's taking him back to the pound. It isn't until the dog digs down and almost drowns, then fills in the ditches that he's dug that the boy is happy and decides to keep the dog. The way in which the dog is threatened is awful. Not a story for young kids."
5,Kids reallydig this book.,"I don't remember this from my childhood, but mychildren sure like it. It is a great bedtime story book.When Ifirst saw this, I thought that it was a immitation Dr. Suess, but I then realized that the style is a little different, not as silly a Suess. The book is about the same size as a Dr. Suess story.The story is about a dog who has lived his whole life in a petstore, and he is rescued by a boy who buys him, and takes him home to the coutryside. The dog is happy to be in the country, but sad since he can't dig because he has spent so much time in the petshop on the hard cold floor. He soon learns how to dig, and gets into lots of fun trouble.My son loves to laugh at the crazy things that this dog does."
5,The chewiest dog chewed this up!,"Had to buy a new copy of this book, my favorite from childhood as my own bad dog recently chewed my copy up! I have most of this book memorized from when I was young. This book also became one of my sons favorites - I bet because I read it to him all the time."
1,Ultimate Internet Outlaw (not!),"If you're familiar with FTP's, email, finding MP3 files (which everyone and their brother can do without breaking a sweat), this book is NOT for you! The information in here is so basic it's embarrassing to think that I fell for reviews given by other readers. The information is VERY dated; he calls searching for mp3's ""illegal"". Oh, and he also talks about all the ""secret and illegal"" files you can find on FTP servers. Like, no one knows they're out there! If you're looking for a book on how to hack, or some really interesting, technical information that you can use while surfing the steamy side of the WWW, this ain't it!"
5,I bought this book off Amazon.com. It is a truly must read!,"This is a truly knowledgeable no B.S. book! A must read for anyone who is interested in high-tech computer crime, without getting caught!!!"
2,Caution,This product works but is not a match for 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado. I had to drill holes to secure the motor to the door.
2,Not a direct replacement for 2000 GC,"Be warned. While the part works fine, it is NOT a direct replacement for a 2000 Grand Cherokee. I used to Amazon ""check it"" tool to confirm it's the correct part. In doing that, I foolishly thought it would just bolt right in. After about 20 minutes of moving it around inside the door I pulled it back out to find the bolt pattern not even close. I just had to drill new holes in the door to make it work. I have pictures to document the bolt pattern spacing difference. I did not have any issue with reverse wiring like another poster had, so he may have gotten a 'Friday' part."
4,Reverse wiring,"One noted issue was that the wiring was reversed. When using the switch on the door for the window, the window goes down when it should go up and goes up when it should go down."
4,Great Product! Better than Chrysler OEM!,"This was an easy replacement for my burnt out window regulator. The OEM one was cheap and the plastic gears kept stripping out. So I found the Dorman 741-557 direct replacement on Amazon for $56 I couldn't pass it up. The window regulator works great! Only downside is I was hoping it was more powerful than stock. But it seems electrical isn't Jeeps strong point. That aside, it's a perfect replacement part!"
2,Bad Motor,"I ordered this product expecting it to arrive in fully working condition. However, upon arrival and installation, I found that the motor is bad. It barely has enough power to raise my window, and strains to lower it. I am very disappointed in this product to say the least."
4,Jeep Dorman Window Motot/Regulator,Good - a little noisier than the factory - but overall the best value I have found.
