4,pretty good at heating small space,"It takes a while to heat up, but eventually heats my small (9x12) office well, even on Low. I haven't tried it in below--freezing temperatures, but I imagine High could manage that."
5,Give it a chance!,"Okay, I'm not a Cher fan, although I do like the song ""Believe"". But, this tape is wonderful! It was given to me by someone who didn't want it, and what a score! I'll admit, Cher is cheesy in her fishnet stockings and black ruffled leotard! But, once you get past that, it's a great workout. I have over 30 tapes, and I always come back to this one. The soundtrack is great, even though the music is a little dated. But, in most videos the music is terrible, elevator-like music. This is rock-n-roll. The moves are great, effective, and fun. Totally worth the price tag!"
1,Boring!,"After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to buy this video. I owe many, many workout videos and this is the most boring by far. I have never been able to complete it. Very dissapointing!"
4,Learn to accept,Ms. Ellis's book is a very comforting read. I recommend this book to anyone who is going through a difficult time. It reminds me of Mother Theresa's message to accept life as it comes. I agree with Ms. Ellis's opinion that we suffer and hurt more because sometimes our expectations are unrealistic. We try to achieve the impossible. I strongly recommend reading this book.
1,What a disappointment,"I was expecting the book to start off with the history of Merck and its founding, then slowly progress through to the current modern day challenges.The book was a slow read and gave very little insight about Merck,its people.What I don't understand is why author spent so many pages detailing the modern day health government policy problems.This was supposed to be a story about Merck.Don't bother buying or even borrowing this book, it will leave you frustrated."
4,Book arrived on time but in poor condition,"The book itself is holding up fine since I made a cover for it, but the product arrived in subpar condition. Otherwise, I have no complaints against it. Just be careful for how this person rates the products quality/condition."
1,Witch Hunt,"I was 100% tuned into this book as I read. I discussed with my peers about this book, my views on the Mormon Church and how my family has been affected by the church. It wasn't until the very end, when I finished the book did I have my own realization about this book and Mrs. Robertson's group. It's kind of a witch hunt. I am not a Christian though I do see him as a philosopher. So from a neutral stand point, it IS a witch hunt. I admit that I think Mormons are nuts but anyone who feels the need to tear down someone for their religious beliefs is just arrogant. I keep thinking how I would feel if everytime I opened the paper I saw an ad about how wrong MY religion is."
4,Wow!!,"Even though I am not Mormon, I have a sister that converted over to Mormonism. I found this to be a very interesting book and read the whole book in one sitting. I just could not tear myself away from it. I've wondered for years about all the ""secret, not sacred"" things that go on in their temple. Doesn't anyone that goes through that ceremony think that it could be wrong to be touched in that way???? I will never understand....."
3,Easy Read on a Religion,This book interested me in that we have an election coming up and our one candidate is Mormon. I am not sure that everything in this book is true. I have had Mormon friends who have been nothing but wonderful to me in the past. It does bring up some interesting contrasts between Protestant Christian religions and Mormon religions.
3,Interesting book,"An interesting book if only to show how easy it is to be caught up in something that later proves to be unsuitable for your needs. It is a severe criticism of the Mormon religion, but from one family's point of view, but the discussion about Mormon practices was interesting."
3,Disappointing ending,"This was my first Kathy Reichs book and I will definitely pick up another one of her books. ""Cross Bones"" was an intriguing mystery based on forensic anthropology. It was a fast-paced, gripping story... up until the end. I felt like there were a lot of loose ends that weren't tied up neatly. I still had a lot of questions involving ""Masada Max"" and possible conspiracies involving the Vatican. Having said that, I'll still read her other books, I really liked the characters Tempe and Det. Ryan, they were good together and I enjoyed the humor they shared together. I think Ms. Reichs did an excellent job of helping me get to know the characters and I'm looking forward to reading more of her books."
2,Poor band,"I have had this watch for about a year. It works quite well but the settings are quite difficult. My principal complaint is the band. It began to ""delaminate"" and then it broke right at the clasp. The band is very specific to this watch and I have not been able to find out how to order another one."
2,"Nice watch, cheap band","This is a nice inexpensive atomic watch with good features. Unfortunately, the band broke after 3 days. I guess the adage ""you get what you pay for"" still holds true. I comptemplated throwing it out, but I really like it, so I fixed it with some velcro. Still using it."
4,Good for business and athletics,"I bought this watch to meet my need for an athletic watch that was dressy enough to wear for business travel. It is A-one in that respect. I travel globally and love having all the time zones built into the digital display. It's also easy to change the time as you enter a new time zone. The watch has many seemingly useless features; however, one standard feature on most sports watches is not available - a ""countdown"" timer - which I often use when cooking. I'm happy with the watch and it has caught people's eyes."
3,accurate time but plastic crystal,"Got this the week before daylight savings time (a first in many years in Indiana) and was pleased to find the watch set itself back an hour overnight. The watch has a plastic face and scatches easily. I like the weight, it weighs very little. Price ($32) vs value, I feel it was a good purchase but the scatching gives it a three."
5,yep.,"like the first reviewer said, it's really good, and a shame it aint longer. Vincent: The Full Story sounds like a winner. thanks+"
1,ONE BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.,"honestly, i mostly enjoyed blame it on me (although i felt ripped off when i realized that 32 flavors was just a cover of ani difranco). BUT--here we go again, another cover (where is her original work????) and frankly, disappointing. also, alana needs to hit the gym. just throwing that out there. have you guys seen the website? check out the fortune cookies pic at www.alanadavis.com personally, i'd go back to the real CSNY or ani for that matter. nice try though."
4,Why Science and Religion are in Fact Compatible,"This collection of essays is another in many recent books turning back the myth that science and religion are dire enemies. In fact, you will see how science blossomed in the Christian West, not in spite of it, but because of it. Some essays are better than others, but this is a good introduction to the topic. See alsoThe Genesis of Science: How the Christian Middle Ages Launched the Scientific Revolution,The Abacus and the Cross: The Story of the Pope Who Brought the Light of Science to the Dark AgesandShow Me God: What the Message from Space Is Telling Us About God."
5,Stylish band with stainless steel buckle,"I have metal allergies and most store bought watch bands simply do not come with stainless steel buckles. I searched extensively until I found this brand. The straps are short (which is nice, I have a small wrist) so they don't have to wrap 2/3rds around; and the band is really elegant. I'll definitely come back here next time I need a new band."
3,Sift the good and the bad,"Fuller's main thesis is not that salvation is the same in the OT as in the NT. His thesis is that the glory of God is the central unifying theme of the Bible and that faith is the human response that most glorifies God. Some places are not very well argued; other places yield a wealth of insight. In spite of much of the good in this book, Fuller comes perilously close to merging faith and obedience as if they are the same thing. As a result, he seems to fail to distinguish justification and sanctification--a very perilous error. While urging one to put the Bible over ""Protestant tradition,"" too often Fuller ends up replacing tradition with cynicism and error. There is, therefore, much danger in this book in the midst of the good."
1,disappointing poor suction,"Got this when the discontinued previous model 15.6 volt dustbuster (which was great) got cracked plastic housing after years of use. Even tho this one supposedly has same power the suction is FAR weaker. The old one could suck up loose change, anything from between car seats, this one can't even pick up loose bits of paper right underneath it.I thought it was defective, returned for another one-- same weak suction.Also the pull-out nozzle has no locking mechanism so you can't reach in any crevices with it, it just pushes right back inside. It's too weak to vacuum anything but loose dust anyway.Poor engineering-- looks like they never bothered to try it before putting into production ."
3,so so..ho hum,not sure about this thing. doesnt hold a charge and clogs easily. works for the small stuff but over all--- so so ..ho hum device.
5,"outstanding - a must buy for A.K., country & bluegrass fans","A wonderful mix of Alison and Union Station. Alison's voice mixed with her gifted musicians push this beyond expectations. Not a bad song on the entire album. Very, very enjoyable listening."
4,Shoddy editing.,"An entertaining read, quite funny at times, somewhat spoilt by shoddy editing (a common problem in Kindle format, and quite inexcusable)."
2,Item was received defective,I ordered this spoon rest with the coordinating burner covers. I had to return everything. The spoon rest had a stain by the flowers. One of the large burner covers had a stain as well. I don't recommend these items based on both being damaged.
5,There's nothing like John McCutcheon live,"I've listened to John McCutcheon since our college coffeehouse days in the mid-1970s. I have to say he just gets better all the time. This is my favorite of his 25-plus albums because it captures the flavor of his live shows--his wonderful musicianship on a number of instruments, his rich signing voice, his warmth in interacting with the audience, and his wonderful storytelling.The set shows the many sides of John McCutcheon. ""Calling All the Children Home"" and ""Christmas in the Trenches"" are two of his best-known compositions. A couple instrumental cuts exhibit his virtuoso hammer dulcimer playing. He sings a couple traditional folk songs (""The Water is Wide"" and ""Joe Hill"") and collaborates with his pal Tom Chapin. He even sneaks in a couple topical songs for which he is famous."
4,I love this part as well!!,"This book is the second part of Genki and contains lessons 13 to 22. Just like part 1 I really liked it. Only thing is that grammar sometimes seems to be a bit short. For example the explanation of transitivity is too short. Maybe they did it to avoid difficulty while learning, but I think it is quite important and a good and thorough explanation is preffered here.I started using 90 days of Japanese Language simultaneous, and actually liked those books even better. The grammar is explained better (I needed this book, to get a firm grasp of what transitivity actually is) and the vocabulary is more extensive.Besides this, it remains a great book, and is good preparation for the JLPT 3 test. After this book I started learning the book Approach to intermediate Japanese by Akira Miura & Naomi Hanaoka McGloin I couldn't find it on Amazon.com ut it is a great book also published by Japan Times. This is the book that should be studied after Genki II."
2,Go chirp free,"My cat is attracted by the catnip, is intrigued by the feathers on the bird, likes the springy tree, but absolutely HATES the chirping noise. She is a real and successful huntress, inside and outdoors, and will play with all sorts of items, but she won't go anywhere near this toy when it chirps. Something about the electronic sound chases her away."
2,5 Stars / 2 Stars / 0 Star,"I have collected the Signature Collections for Gary Cooper, Bogie & Bacall, Robert Mitchum and James Stewart.All of the above are worthwhile efforts for those film icons.This is a dismal collection for one of my favorite actor.None of the films are significant from Burt Lancaster's long and illustrious film career. Truly disappointing.5 stars for Burt, 2 stars for the collection, 0 star for Signature Collection."
2,it is ok but I think it could be better,"I got this toy for my daughter and myself, it is loud and the barking is alittle to much for me. plus the dog has trouble walking he keep falling over. but as for a toy like most my daughter got tried of it quickly."
1,Difficult to tell if you have trained it,I think Tekno is difficult to tell if you have trained it. My children have spent less time with Tekno than I have. They seem to think that it is too difficult to remember all the different buttons you have to push to make the dog respond. I am tempted to return it. It was one of those live and learn purchases.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY YOUNGER SISTER. SHE LOVED IT.... FOR THE FIRST HOUR!!!!!! THIS IS A TOY WHICH MUST BE PASSED BY. AFTER A WHILE IT IS NO FUN. ITS TRICKS ARE DUMB AND GET OLD FAST. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
5,"Tekno is a easy to program, Great Toy","My little brother just got a tekno Dog for is birthday on july 21, 2001. I love this dog so much that im his adopted Dad, This is the best toy ever. Today is july 24, 2001, and I have programed the dog on my own without the help from my mom and dad. My mom freaked out when I showed her all the neat things he could do. It even made her play with him for a while,I have now asked her for a Tekno Parrot. It looks really cool and if it is as easy as my brother tekno Dog to program I'll have it talking in no time. I think that the Tekno Toys are wonderful. And I can't wait until my Birthday.I do argee that the toy was way tooooooooooooooooo hard for me to get out of the box. My daddy had to unscrew all the stuff, but atleast it came with it's own screw driver.Thanks Eric age 7 Tekno Rules!!"
5,tekno the bomb,I just got a Tekno last week and he is so much fun. I love the card trick and his singing is cute too. Poochi is pretty cool too.Tekno never fell apart on me. I like how he cries when he hits an object. I definitly recommend Tekno. So if you want a new toy you should get Tekno....
2,Not worth the dough,"I got tekno a few months back when he first came out, and GEEZ, I wish I hadn't wasted twenty-something bucks on this. Sure, he's fun the first day or two after you get him, but then you get tired with all this button pushing, and he walks waay too much, and his responses to sniffing, being pet on the head and neck, and eating his bone are always the same! Now my tekno is covered in dust. :-("
1,A Disappointment,"Tekno has a fairly complicated programming feature that involves holding down various combinations of buttons. Supposedly he can be set to wake you up like an alarm clock, but strangely instead he would start playing music about 15 minutes after ""sleeping,"" so after two tries I just turned him off. He constantly barks and whines, like a real dog, but unlike a real dog is unable to amuse himself or sleep, and in that way is more trouble than a real dog, if you ask me. Essentially a complicated noisemaker, perhaps amusing for very young children but probably worth only about 5 minutes of amusement for those over six."
4,TOY BREAKS EASILY,MY 5 YEAR OLD SON RECEIVED TEKNO FOR CHRISTMAS. WE HAD THE TOY ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN IT WAS ACCIDENTIALLY DROPPED OFF OUT OF THE ARMS OF MY 2 YEAR OLD SON. THE LEG NOW DOES NOT WORK. I TRIED TO REPAIR IT AND FOUND THAT AN INSIDE PLASTIC PIECE BROKE. I READ THRU THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL TO SEE IF THIS COULD BE FIXED ONLY TO FIND THAT THE LEG DID NOT POP OFF AS IT SHOULD. I REMOVED THE LEG AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO WAY IT WOULD POP OFF CORRECTLY AS IT WAS TOO TIGHT. I AM DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AS IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND NOT VERY DURABLE.
1,What a hunk o' Junk,"This thing shouldn't be considered a dog. It's just horrible. They say on information about it that when it hits a wall a nose sensor makes it stop? No! It just sits there walking at the wall. I laughed my head off at the stupidity of this machine. Also, It never stops barking! Not for one darn second just bark bark bark bark. If you want a real dog, wait until I-cybie comes out. This dog will blow your mind. Go to [their Web page] to see a video of it standing on it's head and all this other stuff. Tekno is stone age."
5,Tekno A Treasure!,"I think Tekno the Electronic Robot Puppy is well worth buying. I have a Poo-Chi and Tekno is more fun to play with. Tekno walks ,shows emotion, and BEST of all has an on/off switch! Poo-Chi is cute, but my son and I soon lost interest in playing with it. We never get bored playing with Tekno. He is the closest thing to a real Puppy!"
4,"Good, but not Great","Being a hardcore Res fan (old school, not this new crap) I bought this when I saw it at my local Best Buy. I enjoyed it and loved it for about a year. Then, when looking through it for about the 200th time, several of the pages came out, just came right out. Looking at the edges, it looks like they are held together with simple glue, which is not surprising.As mentioned in other reviews, there are also mistranslated entries, missing or incorrect information. Don't buy this if you're a stickler for accuracy.This is a great book for fans, if you're a fan, get it. Just don't be surprised if it comes apart if you look at it a lot."
5,Great book!,"If you are a real RE fan or you just want the story from top to bottom you should have this book, great art, details are everywhere. A must!"
4,pool party,I liked the the product but price was too much. My kids love it and get a lot of use out of it.
2,I Bailed Before the Year Was Over,A dear friend who also happens to love birds recommended this one. I listened to the first three tapes and had to quit from lack of enthusiasm. I felt like I was visiting with quirky relatives who lost their charm after a time. The story ambled on with no point or hooks to keep my interest.
2,Disappointing,"Bailey White's essays have the power to charm. Unfortunately, her fiction, full of too many forgettable characters and too little plot, does not."
2,Very confusing characters,I just finished reading the book. It was slow and probably like real southern country life. But I had to be wide awake to read it because there were so many characters introduced and I regularly got confused as to which was which. The author never developed any character in any depth.
2,A Different Bailey White,"I have read and dearly loved both collections of short stories by Ms. White and was excited when I found this novel. A little red flag went up with the cast of character list as if it indicated that the reader would need a program to follow the play. Unfortunately, this was the case. The characters were a bit too quirky and the first half of the book seems not to belong to the same story as the second half. I finished the novel with a quizzical look--not at all the same laugh-out-loud humor and wonderfully drawn characters in the short stories. Sometimes real life is more entertaining than fiction."
4,At Last,"Loved this book. If you are looking for a good story, pick up this and other Genesis Press Love Spectrum novels. Genesis is currently producing the best mulit-cultural novels on the market! This publishers is doing great."
2,Awkward,This book is okay ut kind of off beat. I wish there were more selections in this genre. As a suggestion you should check out An Infrequent Pairing by SaFiya Dalilah.
3,Interesting but Slow,I enjoyed the book and it felt comfortable. It was a little slow in some areas and it took me longer then usual to read it but it was still good. My only problem was that the editor did not catch all the errors.
5,A romance to believe in,"Caronline and Brian meet while she is on her way to a job interview. The moment they bump into eachother it was love at first sight.Unfortunately, Caronline gets the job at Brian's company and sticks by her ""No dating employer policy"". Which Brian is more then willing to break (He is one of 4 owners of the company). It doesn't help that Brian's ex (Ida) works at his company and is determined to get Brian back.This book makes you believe in love. I thought Caroline's extreme reservations about Brian's being white was a bit out there (because she is African-American). But it was a true romance novel. I loved it so much I bought ""Caught in the Rapture"". I'll be commenting on that one as well (Good book).Brian is so sweet and romantic. Driven and determined. Nothing will keep him from convincing Caroline that he is the man for her. He loves her so much, words can not articulately or accurately convey his need for her.I thought it was a good book."
4,ENJOYABLE BOOK!,"I really enjoyed this book. If it wasn't for the [...] it would have been even better. But even with the [...] I thought the author completely captured the relationship between two different people admirably. A must read. Also, if you enjoy interracial novels (black woman/white man) check out www.interracialbookclub.com."
2,Not at all what I thought,I was really hoping for a mature character in the Leading woman. NOT! She was written as if she was helpless. Her thinking and actions were a bit annoying after a while. How she responded to her BF was even worse.
3,"""Economy"" Burner Covers","I gave this product a 3 because altho beautiful, these covers are flimsy.They do however look good on my stove. They are exactly what is advertised...economy, and I would recommend them"
5,a cup of coffee is the universe itself,"This is not a movie to be seen once. After a couple of viewings it has really grown on me. The cinematography is so astounding. Do not be thrown off by the whispered narration. By the end of the film it begins to serve a higher purpose than simply aggravating the viewer (which is what, for me, it initially did). There are so many fascinating moments in this film both in terms of Godard's career and general film history."
4,Rediscover Jerry Hicks!,"Thank goodness Heyliger wrote a series of these books. We don't know them today--I accidentally discovered him on Ebay and found more on Amazon. Written in the voice of a 12 year old boy, this character and his observations , put him in the worthy company of Tom, Huck, Penrod and Little Orvie. Heyliger is funnier than Twain and just as funny as Tarkington. Do yourself a favor---find a Jerry Hicks book and settle in for a great time. Then maybe you'll be seeking out the rest as I am!"
3,"Lacking overall, but decent intro to 4 Old-Orders","I found the first few chapters interesting in which the authors profile each of the 4 featured Old-order groups. However, the editing was distracting because the same point was made multiple times in each chapter (in addition to a couple typos). The last couple chapters compare and contrast the 4 groups, but not much new is added I didn't already get in the first chapters. I wish they had touched upon the more progressive branches in each group, comparing Old-order to more modern counterparts, but there was almost no mention of them. Also, the few facts I did know about Old-Orders before reading this book were not discussed (if these are common misconceptions and not facts, they still deserve space in this book). I still give it 3 stars because I was very interested in the descriptions and brief histories of each group."
5,Amish Books,"This is a really interesting book and tells so much about Amish Culture. I read Amish books, mostly audio books all the time. The stories, both true and fiction are amazing."
4,great quality jazz,"coltrane,flanagan and burrell are fantastic and idrees sulieman was extraordinary-even though he is getting fourth line billing i was extremely impressed with his powerful trumpet more than anything-overall great jazz"
5,Great Resource!,"I'm a first year fourth grade teacher and always on the lookout for good resources. I'm so glad I found this one. When I first introduced picture books into my mini lessons, I explained that picture books aren't ""baby"" books -- there are so many high quality, beautifully written and illustrated books out there. Students love the books, they are engaged in lessons, and they use the books as references for their writing.In addition to the many detailed lesson plans throughout the book, there is a comprehensive listing of things to do with other picture book titles."
5,Amazing Resource for Teaching Writing Traits,"This book is an amazing resource for teaching the six traits of writing. It gives teachers simple lesson plans to follow for each trait. The book also includes a bibliography of several picture books to use which show the focused trait and the lessons can easily be adapted to use these books. Finally, there are follow up lessons and ideas for each trait. This is just what I have been looking for because it makes teaching the traits fun and easy. My students love it! We even purchased a book for every teacher on my grade level."
5,Earth to the Earth Hugger,"This book is a beautiful piece of art. Audrey's character is a shining example of how free our minds can be when we give in to what our hearts feel, and are open with the world. It will spark a excitement and leave you with a smile on your face for days. You may even start finding yourself relating to Audrey and giving Earth Hugs to the world. A modern day classic. This book is for all ages. I strongly recommend it for the child inside of us all."
4,"Pretty easy to use, range could be better","This was a snap to set up due to excellent instructions. I must caution however that you must follow the instructions. The default subnet is strange (comes configured for 192.168.0.229 -- wouldn't 192.168.1.xxx be more likely what someone is already using?). Once you switch the default IP to your subnet, it's really easy. Could be a little more powerful or come with a directional antenna. Signal strength drops of noticably after 40 feet when going through a couple regular house walls (still very usable, just not at the fastest speeds). However, if you can centrally locate it (I ended up moving mine since the most convenient location was at one end of my house), it will cover an entire house with excellent signal strength."
4,Not a storytelling: A serious piece for research,"Dr. Morales Carrión participation in the 1940's Puerto Rican social and economical reforms is undisputable and highly significant for today's apreciation of our political and economical identity.Dr. Arturo Morales Carrión was a true visioner, who formulate in conjuction with the Puerto Rican Democratic Popular Party (PPD) leadership, the formula for our present status quo, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.This book reflects the interpretation of Puerto Rican history that made sense to the statesman and strategists that created what is called today the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.Is a good piece of reference for serious studies of the Puerto Rican path to identity.<BR"
5,Good read,"Good book. Not his best, but still a faced paced, interesting thriller. Worth the time to read."
3,"Nice read, but not his best, and the ending is disappointing","The story is fairly interesting in the beginning, but starts getting somewhat trivial towards the end. Powerful and clever killer all of sudden becomes silly and clumsy. The story winds down too quick. The tone of the book is close to Koontz's latest books, monotone and tiresome, similar to ""Odd Thomas"" and ""Life Expectancy"". I enjoy his early books (e.g., ""Dark Rivers of the Heart"" a lot more.Don't take me wrong, I would probably recommend this book anyway, and somewhat enjoyed reading it. I wasn't bored, and it was hard to put down. It just left a lot to be desired at the end."
5,Velocity is mind numbing!!,"This is the first Dean Koontz book I've read, and I think it is absolutely crazy!! I'm a pretty skiddish person, and this book has me freaked out. I love it!! I just got it last night, I've read 1/2 the book already... and I can not put the book down. I don't read often, but this book has definately changed that!"
3,Not Very Good...,"I was saddened to find that this book was NOT nearly as good as the other Dean Koontz books I've read. I think the biggest problem is that the main character never earns your sympathy; therefore, it's hard to feel much emotion as you read about his trials. Not a terrible book, but definitely not Dean's best."
2,Totally unbelievable (in a bad way!),"I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-Dan Brown."
2,No Substance,"Having read several of Koontz' works, I never quite know what to expect. Some is brilliant, some is nonsense. This falls into the latter category. Gibberish.Punchinello Beezo, where are you?"
2,disappointing ending,I saw this book got great reviews but thought the ending wasnt nearly as good as the rest of the book. Felt sorta like I had wasted my time-almost 500 pages to be let down at end.
3,Suprisingly Good,"This book, though there were slight plot holes and points that were challenging to follow, was a pleasure to read. The beginning sucks you right into Billy's world and you don't want to let go of it, even at the end. Worth the read."
2,"Couldn't put it down? More like, could hardly pick it up!","Maybe I should just quit reading fiction. I started with Grisham and tried Koontz, and they bore me. The plot for this book started out great. But..the author takes off on wild tangents about characters and places for chapters at a time. By the end of the book, I just want it to get to the suspenseful end, that does not happen. The end is so anti-climatic, I have to wonder why I hung in there. And, nothing in this book could remotely related to real life. Just a waste of time."
3,Great Premise Saves the (Overly Long) Book,"Velocity, with its main character forced to choose option A or B, each of which resulting in the death of someone, has a great hook. That hook enabled me to keep reading, even when the book veered away from thrills and instead focused on the main characters state of mind (sometimes for pages on end). The dark secret in the main character's backstory never really entered into the main story, but was a red herring, and left me feeling as though Koontz was seeking to pad the length of what could have been a taut page-turner instead of one that I skimmed through from time to time in search of some action or dialogue.Overall, this was good, but could have been great if Koontz' editor had more power."
2,horror but lack of story and character,"Dissapointed that there was not much character development. A simpler version of Seven and Hannibal, but not as developed.Was more like Saw, but not as graphic."
2,Didn't Do It For Me,"I was really interested in the idea of the main plot, but I gotta say this novel did not do it for me. I know it is fiction and all, but there was just soooo much unbelievable things in this book that it was hard to get into it. This will probably end up being a good action thriller movie once a script writer gets ahold of it and changed a few things and shortens some of the story line down."
3,Suspenseful and intriguing,"There's one thing that makes Velocity stand out from other Koontz novels. Velocity's main character, Billy, seems to have some nice, big faults, unlike most Koontz heroes. Still, the bad guy is completely implausible which keeps this thriller from rising to the level it might have achieved. The story is interesting and suspenseful without the full intensity of ""Intensity"". (I'm glad for that, Intensity was over the line for me.) You can't help but be drawn into the question of valuing a life but it seems that the theme isn't as fully explored as it could have been.(There's nothing supernatural about the villain this time. Myself, I prefer the Koontz stories on the stranger side.) This isn't Koontz's most memorable story but it is an intriguing read."
2,Not the best,"I didn't this book was all that good. It had the possibility to be so much more. We never found out why the guy specifically chose this man to target. He hinted towards the end he had more in mind for him (the main charecter suggested that there were others he had done this too, and he would become ""one of them"") besides just torturing him. But then the main character cuts him down before we can find out.I love Koontz, but this book just didn't do it for me."
2,very small!,This chain is very thin and easy to break. The charm is very small and not suitable for a child. It can easily break off the chain and be swallowed. It was very cheap looking to me.
3,Bosch RA1100 Threaded Router Template Guide Adapter,Haven't used yet! Have not had the time to try it out. Will try in very near future. Thank you!
5,Wolverine Rocks!,"I know most kids don't read original comics anymore, most just read remixed trash.(Besides The New Teen Titans: A+) But I think essential wolverine is for anyone who's mom allows them to pick out their own clothes. This book really shows a little more of wolverine's personal side and I do not mind that it is black and white. My father and I are both comic book fans and I hope one day my kid will pick up this book and become one too. So if you like wolverine (which most should) then this book is for you.Sincerely,Arev U. R."
4,"great romance, but a bit boring",as the title says - it is public displays of affection. the romance is hot - literally - but the story is a bit boring.
1,"trash, waste of money",JUNK! opened the box removed the sprayer and attached the hose filled it up only to find the pump is no good. Creates ZERO pressure therefore no spraying action. Thanks for NOTHING! I personally will be requesting Amazon remove this item so nobody else makes the same bad decision.
1,sprayer disaster,"Of the four Chapin sprayers I ordered,three were defective.Of the three replacements,one was defective-Do NOT reccommend."
3,So far so good,"Works just fine...can adjust to spray steady stream or open spray. You have to pump it every so often to create more pressure, but if you have a small yard like I do, it's no big deal. It didn't clog while I was using it, but I will be curious about the next time I use it since I spray a product that is mixed with canola oil. Sprayer was easy to assembly and use, once I read the instructions."
1,Stopped working after 5 minutes of use - forks stripped,"First of all I didn't get what is shown - no shoulder strap - just the bare-bones sprayer. That was OK. I assembled and tested it as instructions directed. Then after just 5 minutes of use the forks that lift the plunger stripped and would not open the plunger to spray. No unusual force was used, just spraying a thin fungicide on plants. Also,a minor point: the instruction folder is in such tiny type size you practically need a magnifying glass to read it. However, as usual, Amazon's return policy is the BEST!"
5,Top notch research,"Once again Milliken sets the standard for scholarly research regarding the Ohlone Indians of California. This is a valuable resource for anyone who is serious about learning about the Ohlone, and unlike some of the popular books on the subject, it is very well documented. Richard Di Giacomo, author of The Ohlone Teacher's Resource"
1,total disappointment,Bought the nailer from a B&D Factory store and was told it was a new product with no track record. I experiemented with various soft and hard woods with the same poor results. The gun wouldn't sink nails nor would it set them flush on either of the 2 settings. In addition it would jam after each fire requiring me to open the magazine and pull the clip of nails back to reset the gun. I returned the gun thinking I had a defective one only to find the replacement just as bad. Today the store refunded my money. It's a nice gun but it clearly needs more power.
3,Insightful resource for historical events in the first four centuries of Christianity,"Very helpful in revealing written sources for early Christianity. It is written on a college-reading level and (my opinion) has a liberal lean toward Christianity's growth, according to the biblical narratives. However, the author does cite his references for his leanings. I recommend it as a resource to compare with other more conservative accounts of the same era."
3,"BBtter than many, but stilll not great","Nakama 2 is certainly useful, if you are taking a class and have access to other language sources. For myself, however--and perhaps this is due to my Genki background--it seemed overly verbose, far to big, and not too terribly concise. I admit that my feeling might be quite different if I had worked from Nakama 1, but as it was, when I got to Nakama 2, I knew most of the grammar in the first two chapters and all the vocabulary. Sadly, there was vocabulary from the first volume I did NOT know--which made staying on track in class rather diffficult at first.My opinion is that Nakama 2 is good and fine and suitable for class guided study. Make sure to get yourself up-to-date on the vocab and grammar if you don't have a Nakama background, though. And if you are looking for self-guided study, try Genki, instead."
2,Sub Par,"I bought this book having read the other reviews, and thought, ""how could I go wrong?"" It has a great rating, and if the inside is anything like the cover, than this book must have tons of amazing Illustrations and designs in it.I was very wrong and very disappointed when I finally got the chance to read through it. It has a hodge podge collection of designs, NONE of which resemble the dirty, decadence and excess that the cover art and title seemed to promise me(with the exception of those actually used on the cover, 3) and FEW of which came across as genuinely interesting. I dont feel the need to ever open this book again.I was looking for a good reference source for high quality designs and interesting styles, and what I got was a book of blown up egos. If you love to read artist statements, thought processes and the like, this book is for you. However, if you prefer to have this kind of dialogue backed up with artistic excellence, look elsewhere."
5,"Good for ESL readers, entertaining and funny","I enjoyed reading this book with my 5th grade daughter, who is in Japanese school, and thus only getting English input at home. ""Song Lee"" is a fairly easy read for her without being too babyish. The students are 2nd graders in the book but they could just as well be 4th or 5th graders. It was nice to have a character originally from another culture in Song Lee, who seems to have been born in Korea and emigrated to the USA fairly recently. As a child in a bicultural family, who looks a little different from her Japanese peers at school, I think my daughter appreciated the character of Song Lee. My only gripe is the rather sterotypical way in which Song Lee sometimes speaks--'Asian English' for want of a better word. However, it does show that she has come to the USA from another culture and is integrating. Her antics are amusing and show originality. Recommended."
5,saves alot of money,"i am just starting on thyroid hormones and dr. wants tests every 6 weeks. since i have very bad insurance, this test kit saves alot of money compared to hospital labs charging $100+. simple to do after you get used to cutting your own finger."
2,It didn't help with the algae in my tank,I used it as directed and still had a problem with algae. Decided to stop using it in case it was harming the fish
1,This product killed my Cichlids!,"I am not new to caring for fish and have two aquariums. My 50 gallon tank had some difficult to remove algae so I purchased this product. I used the product according to instructions Saturday evening, it made the water cloudy so Sunday we did a 25% water change. We woke up Monday morning and the Cichlids were dead."
4,Good to run to,"I bought this CD at an exhibit of Haring's works. It is a pleasure to run to. The music has a good beat that keeps you going. Sorry that Haring died so young. This was the kind of music that he apparently enjoyed, and you likely will too."
4,Does what it's designed for..,"I bought one of these when our local hardware store had it on for about 40% off. I was a bit skeptical, as I'm a little older and early cordless tools were weak and batteries died quickly; not to mention the problems of ""battery memory"", so you had to buy a new battery every few months (and very expensive).The first real job I put the B&D; unit on was building my new deck. I don't like using pressure treated wood and I couldn't afford cedar. I figured I better screw the decking boards down, in case the plain spruce rotted after a few years and I would have to replace the odd board.I put hundreds of screws (#8 x 2 1/2"")into 5/4"" x 4"" spruce decking boards and the driver worked like a charm. We use Robertson ('square drive' to some people) screws a lot up here in Canada, and the torque you could put on them with this unit was awesome.I highly recommend it."
4,Positive Review,"Wow, that's a lot of power. My 20 amp drill was able to spin it backwards, but this lightweight drill kept up pretty well when I used it to tighten 3/4 bolts.It can also handle the slower drilling. Just pull the trigger half way. And it was about three or four uses before I figured out how to pull out spring loaded hex coupling to lock in the bit. It is the easiest, quickest ""chuck"" I have used.I read several complaints about how noisy it is. It is noisy once the hammers kick in. For low torque jobs, its as quiet as any other drill. But it meets resistance with force. The hammers start pounding and that 3"" deck screw is going in pre drilled or not! Har Har Grunt Grunt! Maniacal laughter..This is a fun home drill that's great for small to med projects, like hanging pictures or installing a deck. Two batteries, a charger, a handful of bits, and a rugged case."
3,"If you like Dan Simmons, beware.","Don't expect something as epic as Hyperion.I found this book a little bit on the boring side. Coming from someone who has read many a long book, thats saying something."
5,Scared the heck out of me!!,"I first read ""Summer of Night"" back when it was originally published in 1991 and was scared by it - I went on to read other Dan Simmons and loved ""Children of the Night"", ""Lovedeath"" and especially one of his short stories, ""Iverson's Pits"" which also scared me, but ""Summer of Night is definitely his masterpiece. With the recent publication of the sequel, ""A Winter Haunting"", also quite spooky but a much quicker read, I had to go back and revisit Elm Haven, Illinois, circa 1960, and found it to be as scary as I remembered it! The Soldier, Duane and the combine, Father Cavanaugh, Old Central, the ""thing"" under the bed...shivers!! By all means, read this book if you enjoy well-written horror - it's similar to King's ""It"" or, in a lesser way, McCammon's ""A Boy's Life"". Wonderful and horrifying!!"
1,Horrible!,"This is without a doubt the biggest piece of crap ever sold on Amazon. After about a hundred button strokes, I still have not even been able to set the time. Total piece of JUNK!"
1,Do not buy this,"I love casio, but this watch is huge disappointment. It is light, filmsy, & the atomic function doesn't even work well. The leather strap is stiff and plasticky and as another reviewer noted, the back is plastic + the cheap sort of plastic. The design looks ok in the picture, but the real thing looks really cheap. It's definitely not worth the $29 I paid for it. You can get a much much nicer casio with that price, especially in Asia."
5,rubbermaid step stool,"Great stool to use at home, to help reach that shelf in the closet, that we can never reach. Just kick it in to place, then step on it. It grabs the floor, and does not move. It is great."
2,Bought it in Egypt with great expectations,"Desperate for anything to read in English while in Egypt I came across this book. Gruellingly slow and culturally confusing. I must admit I kept reading and reading to find out what happens next, but I gave up 50 pages before the end - and haven't been compelled to finish it! Unlike the actual neighborhood that it is set in, this book is just plain boring."
3,Not the Best,"Out of the Cairo trilogy, I found PALACE WALK to be the weakest book. Maybe there is something I'm missing here, because I rarely dislike a book. However, Mahfouz's plot seems trite, and his female characters are very one-dimensional in this novel. He goes at great length to describe the private emotions and desires of the male characters, but the two daughters get no more than mere surface descriptions of their dispositions. Mahfouz is a good author and usues beautiful imagery. But I've read other novels of his that I thought were much better and much more moving."
1,lost in translation?,"Perhaps in the original Arabic this book has life---I would hope so, as Mahfouz won the Nobel prize for literature--but the translation is stiff and lifeless, an academic accomplishment perhaps, but stodgy, difficult reading!!! I challenge anyone to open the book and read any paragraph, and you'll see what I mean!!I'll try another of his novels translated by someone other than William Maynard Hutchins to see if I can get a better idea of Mahfouz's writing!!"
2,Not what I thought,"The product is probably what was advertised--however, on receipt, found that it was not what I needed. Sent e-mail to the company for return instructions and never heard from them."
5,music at its finest,having seen Bill Evans playing solo at the Village Gate in 1967 I knew his sound was different then anyone else. With this Trio we hear great interplay. Scott La faro sound was beautiful. Paul Motion easily matched their great musicianship. Glad to have this album back this time on cd
2,A bit too precious,"This is a really cute book if you want to make a couple of jars of jelly to impress your friends but if you want a basic guide to canning that is practical and always useful, this is not the book for you. Try the Ball Book or ""Company's Coming"" for no fail recipes and stuff that is not so cute."
4,Love In Sicily,"I've never been to Sicily, but Ms. Arthur sures makes me want to go there and find a handsome hunk like Jordan Blake to go with me!This story starts out with two very attractive people admitting that they are very attracted to each other. The sexual tension alone was enough to keep me interested. Even though I normally like a little chase in my hero and heroine, there's something refreshing about two intelligent people admitting that they are physically attracted to one another yet searching for an emotional connection.The mystery of murder and the mafia are a good touch, it adds to the overall appeal of the book. While I think the ending may have been a little rushed, Ms. Arthur certainly makes up for that throughout the novel.I understand that this is her first novel. Well, keep up the good work girl! I will most definitely be buying the next one!"
1,"Nice looker, but doesn't work","Bought this great looking watch for my kid's birthday. By the time we gave it to him and found out it doesn't work, it's too late to return it. Now I'm stuck with a watch that's more to repair than it was to buy....Best be careful!"
4,Fullmetal Alchemist Edward,Well made but pricey plush of your favorite little achemist Ed Elric. He has a loop on the top of his head to hang from a hook or your rearview mirror.
5,"Excellent, Simply Marvellous!!!","In my own words, is partly a biography and partly an autobiography shedding light onto the mysteries surrounding the Argentine saint Evita. It contains her death bed manuscript that she wrote in her last few months in her fight against cancer. This book details the portrait of a woman very much loved, even worshipped-Santa Evita. This book is a must for everyone wanting to know about the real Evita Peron and how she was supressed by the cowardly forces of Argentina but none the less, her rainbow always shined through until the 26th of July 1952 when she took her last breath at just 33."
1,I have read other books on the issue much more useful,"The book spends first half of it explaining why people is so critic with the marvellous principles of investment criteria that are going to be explained.The second half explains why other criterias of personal saving-investment are not appropiate.Appart from some unchained and undetailed principles of inevestment such as ""move your money fast from one investment to another"" that do not have any link with a more general theory all of it is useless.I bought it on third party advice and it is my opinion.Regards,Enrique."
5,Swen,Got this for a Bi-Polar now ex girlfrined...she seemed to like it. No wait she didn't like it....oh now I think she does like it. Seriously though a good product if you still have a VCR to play it on
5,Beautiful gospel.,"I actually bought this as a gift. I was not a gospel fan. Neither was I an Alison Krauss fan. And who was the Cox family? Now that has all changed - I loved it! Very moving, emotionally and spiritually (even if you are not that way inclined). I quote from the giftee: ""An excellent example of the genre."" Take the time to listen for yourself - it will be worth it."
5,One Song is Worth the Whole CD,"I heard ""In the Palm of Your Hand"" from this CD on TNN last night....one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard....I will buy the CD for that song alone, knowing that the rest can't be far different! Thanks Amazon, for making this kind of research possible! And thanks, Alison!"
1,Gutless,"This is a powerful collection of photos and words. I like this volume better than any of the others I have seen since the 11th. The production is very professional, the pictures all look good-even those that are obviously from other sources and look somewhat grainy. A great book in that regard. The only thing that has kept me from buying this is that Reuters refused to call this an act of Terrorism!..."
4,good buy,excellant product. been needing something like this for years. I think the drill holster could be a little better but only time will tell how it holds up. Some smaller pockets would be helpfull for individual tools. But as a general product its pretty cool. Already paid for itself.
5,Excellent source of information,I got this book for my brother who has thyroid cancer. He has told me several times that he has used this book to cross check the doctors and get information that was hard to otherwise get. He was very satisfied.
2,Drags a lot in the middle,"This is not the typical John Francis Cuddy book. For one thing, Healy's always been a dependable detective novelist, with the right mix of suspense and intrigue, and a plot that leaves you wondering who the killer is. In this instance, instead, the book's almost 400 pages long, and you have the feeling that it's almost overwhelmed by the dialog. I actually looked when I reached the end of one sequence, and nothing had happened except conversations for about 90 pages. Then the author throws in a knife fight, almost as if he knows he's gone overboard, but he needs all of the clues he didn't plant. Nothing really seems to come from the conversations, either.I wish I could have reviewed this book more positively: I've liked other books in the series considerably more, though it's been a while since I read one. This one just didn't click with me."
5,great upgrade,"Purchases these to replace the drawers in my entertainment center. The ones in there didn't slide, and were sized for DVD's and CD's. Shelves work great for anything you throw in them, and they slide all the way out to access discs in the rear. Old racks would leave the back fourth inside the cabinet and made them difficult to see."
1,Still Warning To You,"WARNING: This is an amateur film shot on video. It looks like a Nickelodeon TV show, has mediocre acting, barely passable dialogue, no story, horrid make-up jobs, poor lighting... there is nothing redeemable about this movie. The other reviewers were either friends of cast/crew or part of cast/crew. AVOID.[Average of 1,431 ratings: 1.9 stars]"
2,not interesting,"This book was suggested at my ""book club"".When we met again to discuss the book, we talked more about JFK than about the book. This is not a good book to read in 2009, when we know so much about cloning."
4,Bittersweet,"I think this is a great program, but there are no directions that I could find and so therefore not as easy to use. I have figured most of it out. It does have the help section, but I like to be able to read it on paper, not have to search for everything on the computer."
3,Very Cute!,"These flower quilt clips look really cute in my daughter's room. However, they do not hang strait. I am still happy with them though! Easy to put up too."
1,Nothing like the original,"You have got to be kidding. This is a bad practical joke. These taste more like library paste than the Root Beer Fizzies we grew up with. Absolutely undrinkable. You can measure the water as directed, you can double them up to make them twice as strong as directed, you can add sweeteners not mentioned in the instructions...none of this will help them taste like the original Root Beer Fizzies. Save your money."
4,Nice comfortable bra,"Super comfy bra. Perfect for just hanging around the house and very pretty. It doesn't offer as much support as other lined bras do, but still a very nice bra."
2,area 51 series,"plot is boring and repeatedly shows the same situations, but with different characters. a big waste of time and money"
2,Real letdown from the first two books in the series,"While I could barely put down the first two books in this series this one left me vastly disappointed. Very little was revealed about the Airlia and their plans for earth and the new elements - The Watchers, The Ones Who Wait, The Guides, and the Mission - led to an almost inexhaustable page-turning effort in the wrong direction!Complicated novels are good, but ones that leave you feeling you know less about the situation than you did when you started are less than appealing. In addition the virus element was neither intriguing nor spell-binding. I found myself driving to finish the book so I could quit reading it rather than for the excitement.As I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books I hope he returns to weaving the webs of the Airlia rather than trying to set up the next ten novels. Wrap the series up within two books and move on."
4,An entertaining story and an easy read.,"If you enjoyed the first two books in this series, you will enjoy this one. The characters are enjoyable and the basic story line is intriguing. Some readers may find the ending rather abrupt, but it is clear that the story will continue. Although I am not usually a sci-fi fan, I am looking forward to the next book."
2,Thats All,This third volume in the series is the one that killed it for me. Halfway through this book is when i realized what a chore it was to read. After 150 pages of rehashing the first two books in this series i put it down for good. The author should perhaps stick to the military thrillers and leave science fiction to the ones better qualified in the genre.
1,"Please no more ""cut-n-paste"" Robert Doherty aka Bob Mayer","I had the misfortune to read ""Z"" by Bob Mayer before reading this book. What a crock. The small bits cut and pasted between Z and his other Area 51 novels was kinda ok, but in this one? What's the matter Bob, in a rush to get to print? Next time, give us break. Do something original or don't bother."
3,"Kindle edition marred by typos, mangled table of contents","A nice collection, 4+ stars on the stories...but a very poor ebook conversion. The least the publisher could do is to provide a useful table of contents. This one is terribly mangled and nearly unusable. It bears little resemblance to a list of titles and authors, and contains a vast number of subtitles of sections within stories, but with no distinction between real story titles. Apparently an unsupervised computer program created it.The text is also rife with typographical errors. Apparently this text was scanned from a hard copy without benefit of either spell check or human review. Shamefully lazy effort by the publisher."
4,OOPS!,"Sandra Boynton, <strong>Blue Hat, Green Hat</strong> (Simon and Schuster, 1984)Another chronically-cute Boynton book, this one focused on color recognition and clothing, but featuring a turnkey who simply can't get anything right (and the refrain ""oops!"" whenever he's featured). Unilke most books aimed at the preschool set, though, this one's building up to an actual punchline, and I actually laughed out loud the first time I read it to the kid; probably my favorite of its type since Emily Gravett's <em>Wolves</em>. Good stuff, this. ****"
1,Colors are wrong,"First two blue items are actually purple, the same color as the purple socks at the end (which has an actual blue item on the same page). Printing error, I hope. Returning this. Content seems good, if not for the wrong colors. Will have to purchase it locally."
4,Reads well !,Daughter requests this one often ! Loves to say oops and laughs at the pictures-she got this one before we did! Loves to point out what not quite right.
5,Love this book!,"Our 16 month old loves this book! He loves to name the articles of clothing and thinks the ""oops"" is hilarious! He wants to read it at breakfast and takes it in the car with him - it's a hit! We love all of the Boynton books at our house. I highly recommend them!"
1,Don't buy it,"The product is easy to assemble, however it doesn't last. The plastic hinges are all broken now, it's very flimsy and a total waste of money. I hung regular jackets and coats, maybe 5 or 6 of them so it's not even that I over loaded it. I regret this purchase a lot so pick something else."
2,Flimsy rack,"This rack was easy to assemble, yet fell apart under the weight of 8 or 10 children's dance costumes! Would not recommend this rack to others-not sturdy enough. There were more plastic components than I expected. It will end up being used just one time-waste of money!"
3,"Great Performance, Bad Recording","I wish there were 2 ratings: 1 for artists' performance and the other the sonic quality of the CD recording. In the case of this CD by Fernando Ortega, I would rate the former at 5 stars while the sound quality of the recording is rated at 1 star (sounded too artificial and bad studio mixing) which marred my enjoyment of this otherwise great performance."
4,Good Quality,I have been looking for a leather checkbook cover for two years. This is just what I needed and a very good price. The only drawback is that the Colts emblem sticks out a bit and bends my checks if I carry it in my back pocket. Not a problem if it is in a purse or coat pocket.
3,Unbeleivable Results,I took 2 tests about 6 weeks apart. I got exactly the same levels on LDL and total choleterol on both tests even though I had been on cholesterol medication and a low cholesterol diet for that time period. I find these results very hard to believe!
1,Didn't work for me.,Regrettably this test failed to even come close to a lab test my physician ordered the week prior. I was trying to match a baseline so I would have a reliable alternative to an office visit. The test from Biosafe came back 90 points lower on total cholesterol. I followed all instructions provided accurately. I suggest if you want to use this product that you first baseline it against a doctor ordered lab evaluation. As for me I continue my search.
3,From Back Cover,"WHO IS SLEEPING IN MY BED?Living alone in the Colorado Rockies, U.S. Marshal Dan Mason didn't want company. Still, Dan couldn't resist a damsel in distress, especially when a hiking accident left violet-eyed ""Angel"" on his doorstep with no memory and no identity. Even if sharing his tiny cabin with this mysterious, vulnerable beauty was pure temptation!Angel might not know who she was, but she was sure she'd never encountered a sexy lone wolf like Dan before. He had closed off his heart behind a thorny wall, but Angel could see beyond his gruff exterior. She was determined to bring Dan back to life...though it was going to take more than one steamy kiss to do the trick![2nd in trilogy]"
3,Better books on Kabbalah,"This book has good advice/insight in some areas, but I didn't love it. Buy it if under $5. Otherwise, get another book on Kabbalah!"
5,A Spiritual Handbook,For those of you like myself that are seeking the Path to Spiritual Growth and Transformation. The Way is the ultimate hand book for empowering us to adchieve this goal. It will answer all your questions and show you the way!
2,cute... but NOT durable,"I had this bag & it lasted a whole 3 months, then the inside lining started to come apart and one of the straps broke off. I would NOT recomend this bag. It is VERY cute at first but does not live up to standards."
1,stinks,paper won't stay on.hard to tighten the nut when you try to put it on.nothing to hold on to.spend more money and get the delta disc sander.very nice.
5,Does exactly what it says it will do.,"The QL-500 label printer is a very simple product to use that yields perfect results every time I use it. The included software works very well in synchronizing with Microsoft Office applications. Labels print out very FAST and with impeccable quality. You cannot smear the printed items and the labels seem impervious to water.And at this price for a refurbished unit? Come on!No cons yet--if you need labels for things regularly, make it easy for yourself and just get one of these. It's quite a bit easier than worrying about printing off whole sheets of labels, especially when you just need one or two."
2,Not what I expected,"It's okay and the interface is nice, but with the images on the box one would think they were getting elegant images for scrapbook pages, NOT, I hate cutsey and most of it is just that! Not what I want and since there is a 90 day money back guarantee, guess what? It's going back and the company better give me my $40.00 back! not an exchange either."
3,"Fun, but I can't see it on TV","I found this software to be a lot of fun. It makes very nice scrapbook pages, although like other reviewers said, the clip art is kind of cartoonish. I made a few pages, but haven't printed them out yet.I'm kind of upset that it advertises that you can make a photo disk that can be played on any DVD, because it cannot be played on mine! I spent hours making a beautiful scrapbook of my daughter's birth and added music and everything, burned the disk, and it wouldn't play on my DVD player. So, I went out today and bought a new DVD player that says it plays this type of disk, and it still wouldn't play. If you don't have Burning Nero software on your computer, it makes it very hard to just burn the disk. It kept sayng my burner was ""unsupported"". You have to generate a video and then burn it on your own. Obviously something is going wrong because I still can't see this on my TV."
3,looks like a mosquito,This is pretty but the stake is welded at such a spot that my son thought it was a mosquito! Not really worth the money even on sale.
2,Inaccurate description,"I ordered one and when it arrived, the lights were candelabra base. Customer service had another shipped to me and it was the same. Do not buy this if you want standard base bulbs."
1,VERY LOUD!!!,Over the years I have bought apprx. seven ceiling fans for my homes. This is by far the LOUDEST fan ever. I put it in our kitchen and when the fan is running (especially on low) you can hear a humming sound throughout the house. I'll give it another week or so and see if the issue resolves itself. If not I will be returning this fan.At this point I would NOT recommend.
2,"Nice looking, but noisy!","We loved the looks and price of this fan. However, after putting one of them up, the sound is really bad. It sounds something is getting ready to take off in the middle of your bedroom! We returned the fans to amazon."
3,wrong bulbs,"Nice piece. But I made the mistake of assuming that the package of bulbs sold on the same page would be the right kind - it is not. And now I have to go and get the candelabra bulbs, different and more expensive - and I can't use the regular bulbs I already have. The site designer should put the oorrect bulbs on the page, so we don't get fooled. I am unhappy about this misunderstanding, and the dumb page design. Pay attention!AC"
4,Ceiling Fan for Son's Room,"Great price for the fan. It has a nice updated look, it's quiet, and pushes the air OK but is not a super-blowing fan. The only complaint is that one of the light shades was broken. We went to Home Depot and bought a replacement that was similar but not exact match. Good deal for the $."
1,Blade screws are way too long!!!,"I am PO... I got my old fan off and got this new one half way done then I found out that the blade screws are way too long. I srew one in all the way that it won't go in any more and I still have about a quater of an inch sticking out, and it will not hold the blades in place.Now, I gotta run to the hardware store, which is miles away!!! Grrrr... I will update this review on how it perform when I get the right length of srews..."
2,Pretty but not much air flow,"I replace another fan I had with this one. The other fan would blow papers around the floor. This one barely blows smoke around. If you're looking for a fan that looks good, this one does look good. But if you want one that actually blows air around the room, this one isn't the one to get. The pitch on the blades just isn't enough to move the air.It's pretty, it's quiet ... but that's about it."
2,Easy to install but hums at lower fan speeds,"This fan is easy to install and has a very appealing look for the price, however, at low fan speeds it hums quite readily. The reason for this humming comes from the fact that Westinghouse designed it with only two capacitors instead of the standard three. Capacitors suppress the humming sound."
2,Very Brittle Plastic,These boxes are made a very brittle plastic! One arrived broken. I would not expect very long service from these boxes.
5,I don't know where I'd be without this wagon,"With two young children that love to get out for any reason I adore this wagon. Its great for short trips to the park or down to the ice cream shop, decorating and walking in the local parades, Day trips to the beach - you name it. My chidlren both get very excited when I pull this out because they know something fun is going to happen. Now with a third child coming I only wish they would make a three seater..... Though the ride is so smooth and easy to pull my eldest is easily able to pull her brother around in it (with supervision of course), which they both enjoy as well."
5,great wagon for older infants and toddlers,"This is a great wagon for older infants and toddlers. Well made. Rubber tires and easy to pull. Seat beat straps function well. Canopy was purchased for grandson in Texas, bought two more for grandchildren in the north. Total three purchased, They are all used almost every day.Highly recommend."
4,Ordered for Grandson,"Grandson is only one year old and with the winter weather in Michigan, we've not opened the box yet but it looks like it will be perfect for the beach or anywhere else."
2,informative but not inspiring,"Since I am really fascinated by the work (and life) of Tupac Shakur I wanted to read this book. First thing I do, I check the photos and see this horrible autopsy-picture that really upset me. How humiliating to show this in a book!!! I thought about tearing it out and sending it back to the author or publisher but haven't done it yet... After reading the authors explanation about why she put the picture there - to stop weird rumours about Tupac still being alive I might perhaps accept it. The book is ok but I didn't get all the information that I was looking for about Tupac - this was more about the actual police-work etc. Still the book is ok and I'm glad I read it. I think it is important to put some light on ""the killing..."" and Scott shed some light on it"
5,tupac,"I think tupac was grate and he still lives in are harts . I like the song ""DEAR MAMA"" cus tupac had love for his mom . He was grate i hope hes in heven even thu he did alot of bad things . I am not happy about the MTV awords that his song didint win . I hope his mom still has him in her hart. I LOVE U TUPAC"
5,Love these chips!,"I first saw these chips in the grocery store. I bought the other flavors first because they sounded good, but the best were the sea salt... until I went back and tried the Red Velvet. I've been hooked ever since; just the right amount of flavor and all of that crunch (the best part). I am not a big potato chip fan because they are too salty and too oily, and I don't like bagel chips or pita chips either. After my last bag of lasagna chips was empty, I went back to the store where I had purchased them, and they were out and haven't restocked. Thank goodness for the internet because now I don't have to settle for an occasional potato chip, I can get my lasagna chip fix again."
2,I regret reading this book,"If you're a fan of superhero fiction, you'll probably like the first four-fifths of this book. It's well written, the characters ring true, and the story sticks to the Spidey universe.The ending, though, is almost like the writer got tired of the whole thing and just wrote a quick ending so he could be done with it.It is only in this last small part that you find out Doc Ock is the villain. There's a kind of lame connection between Doc Ock and this designer drug which is the main source of the conflict, and the characterization of Ock makes him out to be a kind of tight-assed sissy.Worse, there's a bogus final scene where the Doc is taken into custody -- by ordinary cops, no less -- that you'll probably hate. Sadly, the epilog is better reading than the main story ending.It's not often that I really, really wish I'd found a better use for my time than reading a book, but this was one of them."
2,"BEWARE: Low quality media. Price is cheap, but is your data?","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
5,Come Before Winter,"Come Before Winter and Share my Hope by Charles Swindoll is an excellent book. It is full of humor, insight, trivia, history, and outstanding common sense. It helps one develop a better understanding and a personal relationship with God. It has Mark Twain's humor and logic. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
5,very cute!,Really comfortable but interesting everyday type of earring. The silver is nice and bright and the soladite is pretty. I wear them often at work.
3,Smaller than expected,"Although they are very pretty, they are very very small - I was disappointed because they are a Christmas gift for my boss. I will give them to her anyway as they are pretty."
5,old barbers remedy,"Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops. Its all-natural antiseptic properties work as an astringent that instantly closes razor nicks from shaving. soothes and cools razor burn when rubbed over the entire face after a shave. Run it under cold water and lightly rub it over your face to soothe and cool razor burn after shaving. Alum was used by the Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago as a pore closing astringent. If you find a cheaper brand it is OK, there are not much differences between them. A bar will last for years."
4,Daisy Powerline CO2,"I had marginal results with another brand of cartridge. These appear to be better, in that they provide more shots. Amazon service is excellent!"
5,"Well-Researched, Fascinating Facts","Although the storyline is fiction, the well-researched facts that the storyline is wrapped around enrich my mind and inspire poignant contemplations. My own research coincides with the gems of historical facts found in this book -- the Black Madonnas of Europe remember Mary Magdalene, Jesus' wife, as a black woman; the lies of the Church... the storyline is a wonderful platform for the courageous presentation of much factual information. I enjoy knowledge intermingled with a great story -- entertainment with very meaningful content. This is not empty-headed drama. I recommend this book as an experience!"
5,fantastic listening experience!,Not only is Wes in superb form but the rhythm section as well that definitely makes this album a MUST buy!
5,This headset exceeded my expectations.,This product exceeded my expectations. It's always hard to tell how the final product will perform when you order on line but I followed the reviews and am extremely pleased. It wears well and the sound quality is excellent. For someone who used to go home with a crook in my neck at the end of the day I feel wonderful! Highly recommend.
4,Excellent style and function,"I had used an older model plantronics headset in my office for the past 15 years. It held up very well. The sound was wonderful and it was very durable. It was still working, but I wanted to go to a wireless device. I decided to go back to plantronics because I had loved the older one so much. I was not disappointed! It looks very stylish and the sound and comfort is great. The only thing I would really mention is that you must keep it plugged in all the time. If you unplug it whenever you are away from the office, the battery continues to run down. I experienced this the first time I used it. After that I have had no problems with the battery lasting me the whole day. I do however put it back in the charge cradle while on my lunch hour. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for quality sound and comfort."
4,Good Luck Replacing the battery,"This is a pretty good headset and I've been using it for 3.5 years without any major issues. I'd recommend it. However, the talk-time was slipping between charges to the point where I had to replace the battery. You can get to the battery, but to replace it I literally had to use a soldering iron. This is less than ideal and not something a lot of people know how to do (and I'm no soldering expert). Plantronics really could have done a better job on that aspect."
5,A wonderful tribute to a wonderful spiritual director,"Beth Porter, Susan Brown, and Philip Coulter have done a magnificent job of collecting memories of Henri Nouwen from those who loved him. These recollections are by core members of the Daybreak community who lived with Henri, persons who met him only once but who were transformed by the encounter, persons who worried about Henri's woundedness but also celebrated it as the source of his incredible sensitivity to the wounds of others. My favorite recollection is by Michael Arnett, the brother of Adam, Henri's companion at Daybreak. Michael says: ""Sometimes I do sit on Adam's bench. Right by Daybreak pond. Think about Adam. Think about Henri."" So do I. So do all of us whose lives were touched by Henri Nouwen. Thanks to the editors for reminding us of how much we owe him."
4,Great camera!,"Well, I just got this camera yesterday, and I must say, I am impressed! The features are neat, and the lcd screen is pretty big. I haven't used all the features, but so far, it's really easy to use! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was some confusion in regards to installing the cd, which the written instructions could've been more clear on. Other than that, a great camera!"
4,Good Camera,"I got this camera as a present and I must say that it is quite good. The zoom works well, it doesn't come in blurry at all. I love the color filters in this camera, it can add a lot of depth to pictures. It captures video and the video is pretty good too. I found that this camera was easy to figure out as far as menues go, which is saying a lot considering I have a really difficult time with a lot of other cameras. The only reason this is missing a star is because it's a bit of a battery eater, but I find that rolling the batteries in my hands will charge it enough to look through the pictures and take a few more."
2,Fits its purpose,"I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda. It was ok. Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to. BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense. My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it. Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality. I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products."
3,"OK as an historic document, weak as an opera","Compared to many Italian operas this particular opera lacks drama. The music doesn't develop during the production; there is a marked thematic similarity regardless of the character or action. As noted by the previous reviewer this production is a film with actors synching to singers. According to the package information some of the roles are sung by the person in the film, but the major roles are sing by a different person than the one seen on the screen. Color balance is uneven, many of the scenes have an orange - yellow ""wash"" over the entire scene. It is unclear to me if this was intentional or not. The settings and custumes are lavish. If you have never seen a boar hunted on horseback this production has it. In general I enjoyed the DVD, but it is not one that I will be viewing more than once or twice."
5,She Moved Me,"I purchased 'Let's Get Moving' with Debra Mazda after reading the very informative reviews here at Amazon - thanks !!I have previously bought several Leslie Samsone walking DVD's which are OK but some of her workout's are too repetitive and unprofessionally put together and not enough stretching after the walk.I'm 63 and suffer quite a lot with Arthritic pain in most parts of my body and it's a must for me to exercise and stretch to keep the stiffness and pain under control. None us want to spend our old age relying on pain killers.Quite frankly I really enjoy Debra's routines which I surprisingly managed to push myself through on the first attempt !! However I've had to persevere with some of the steps to get them right, my aging co-ordination not being very good....The bonus stretch is fantastic !I highly recommend this workout for any age group."
1,"It's funny for a couple pages, and then it's boring, and then you hate it.","... It's funny for a couple pages, and then it's boring, and then you hate it.The only good chapter is the one about the way baby boomers abuse language. It's all true. Although the way he uses the death of Julius Erving's son to prove his point is a disgrace.The rest is unimaginative, repetitive (to no good effect) and pretty much disgusting...."
3,Very Funny,"""Balsamic Dreams,"" is a long rant about an easy target that takes about an hour and a half to read, and pays off with a few good laughs, and quite a few grins of recognition. I just wish he'd skewered the nature lover in his SUV, or the soccer mom with her ""These colors don't run"" bumper sticker. Mr. Queenan is a clever writer. His book is good for a laugh. Wait for the remainders."
5,Excellent for architects new to AutoCAD,"Most AutoCAD instructional books are very comprehensive. They attempt to cover all the facets of the program and to provide examples relevant to all the various professions that use the program. As a result, they are suitable for a six month course or as a reference tome, but excruciating for anyone trying to pick up AutoCad at home. This author focuses in on basic skills that are required in architectural drafting and cuts away the clutter that you can pick up later as you become more experienced. The training exercises are logically sequenced and techniques become effortlessly ingrained through repetition. This is simply the best work I've seen for getting an architect with limited CAD experience up and running."
5,EXCELLENT PRICE AND QUALITY,This is the original shock that came with the truck when it was new. Bilstein makes this shock for GM. I could have put a less expensive shocks on the vehicle but i wanted the OEM part. The shocks come in ACDelco boxes and comes with every thing that you see in the picture.
5,Royal Class Music!,"If you like country, calm melodic or acoustic music, this CD won't disappoint you. Great performances, both vocally as well as instrumentally. Really nice songs, great instrumental solos on acoustic guitar (""Oh Atlanta""), dobro, banjo and great double bass (""When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart""), and of course world-class fiddle solos by Alison herself. If you appreciate quiet, thoughtful, sophisticated acoustic music, this CD will bring chills to your spine. Without doubt, I will listen to it for the rest of my life. It's worth much more than 5 stars, but that's all I can give.Eltjo Haselhoff."
3,new or used,"I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ALL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM AMAZON, HOWEVER WHEN IRECEIVED MY COPY OF THE CD NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU BY ALISON KRAUSE, WHICH I BOUGHTAS NEW, I FOUND THAT ALL APPEARED OK EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE CD CASE WAS NOT WRAPPED.ALL OTHER CDS THAT I HAVE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON CAME WRAPPED. SO I AM NOT SUR WHETHERMY CD WAS NEW, AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, OR USED. IT PLAYS GOOD. THERE ARE NO SCRATCHESOR SKIPS. JUST NOW SURE MY NEW PURCHASE WAS IN REALITY NEW"
3,Found her!,"Alison and her band - what can I say? This CD remains in heavy rotation due largely to my best friend, Dawn. She harmonizes with Ali on ""Now That I've Found You"" and it's pretty stuff.The whole album is wonderfully pretty. When I play it at my farm, my brother who lives in a house nearby, always comes down and says...""Who is this again?"" Enjoy."
5,WOW,"Gosh, were to begin? Alison has the most beautiful voice! Actualy, I only bought this CD for the song ""when you say nothin at all"" becuase it is sooo pretty. and although the other songs are GREAT that is still my favorite. trust me, the CD is fantastic, especially that one song!"
2,Not accurate,"I bought this bubble level for my telescope as a spare mostly because I wanted a small dual plane level. When it arrived I placed it on a surface I knew was pretty level. It indicated that both planes were off level by quite a bit. I noticed that there was a small magnet glued to the bottom of the level. I got out two of my larger levels to compare and found that this level differed from both significantly. This may be due to the way the magnet was attached, not really sure. All I know for sure is that it would not suit my purpose. This particular level may have been defective as there have been some good reviews. Just be careful if you do choose to buy and check the level before relying on it. Good luck!"
5,Real case history which best motivates a brain tumor patient to fight and win,"Ben Williams is an extraordinary man,against the ropes with few months to succeed or die, his research,great understanding,and above all the courage to have the distance to think rationally,allowed him to take the necessary steps to survive the deadliest form of brain cancer.His story is not only utmost educational, informative,written in a simple and interesting manner, but a real inspiration for escaping the paralysis of helplessness and instead fight to win!! A must read for any brain tumour patient,or caretaker, and beyond, for any cancer patient.Cancer patients and caretakers must not leave the doctor alone in the management of treatment,is imperative to take charge of the situation.Ben William's book is an example of how to achieve exactly that.Roberto Rimeris, husband of a brain tumor survivor."
4,Workhorse LCD.,"I got this TV almost 4 years ago. In that time, it has been on for tv watching a minimum of 4 hours per day, many more like 12+. It has been a workhorse of a TV, with none of the problems I expected buying a brand I had never heard of.+good picture+always works+lots of inputs+picture in picture with many settings+good sound for a TV-had some screen position issues *only when used with a PC, never on TV, movies, or gaming.*-widescreen settings are not as useful as one would want."
3,Tolkien buffs will want to read this authorized biography,"With Tolkien mania on the rise again, Tolkien buffs will want to read this authorized biography. This is a well written, interesting biography that fleshes out Tolkien's personal and professional life. Tolkien's relationship to C. S. Lewis is detailed, including the part he allegedly played in Lewis' conversion. Whether Tolkien himself was a Christian is doubtful. He was a Roman Catholic and extremely religious, but his relationship with Christ is not explored in this book.Those who like Hobbits and Middle-earth will enjoy this biography; all others should skip this one."
2,Unscientific,"I read about half of it. Very few of the chapters are interesting, most are unscientific. Read the volume that criticizes Arthur Jensen's theories, with Jensen's replies. It is one of the few books of this type that gives 2-perspectives."
5,A telling book,"Although I grew up in very different surroundings than the characters in this book, I cold not help but relate to their issues. This novel left me wanting more. The pages flowed with a gentle poeticness that I did not anticipate upon picking up a book about rural Pennsylvania.Hooray for David Drayers first novel! I am waiting anxiously for his next work."
5,It works!,"This book is great for beginners and for those who have been working out for awhile. Very easy to understand routines, safety tips, stretches and warm-ups. When I first discovered this book I had not worked out with weights at all. I felt challenged initially, yet the different programs the authors have worked out make the workouts fun, and definiteley not boring. I loved the pre-set routines when I first started, yet I ultimately customized my own to make it work even better for me. I recommend this book highly!"
4,Stands the test of time well.,"Years after a car accident ended my weight training, I feel well enough to go back to free weights and pulled out this old book. Lots of books show dozens of moves and some may do a better job of explaining them. But this book does something that I've not seen that often in other books; they present a logical series of workouts that accelerate in intensity as your fitness increases.The graphic layout of the programs is easy to translate into a spreadsheet or forms and you'll find it easy to adjust weight, repetition and set counts as you progress.At the price this book goes for now you can't go wrong. It's true that the photos are pretty bad, but you don't need to spend much time looking at them anyway."
3,Medium happy with these.,"I have just installed the third light on my mom's back porch. She loves them, but I am not exactly thrilled about having to replacing them every 5 years. Bulbs seem to last a few years each. Great security light."
5,Awesome Sound,"After upgrading my DAW software,( Cakewalk Sonar, Propellerheads Record and Reason) I needed to upgrade my sound card as well. Cakewalk provides a hardware compatability page and I discovered that the EMU 1616M was perfectly suited to my needs.[...]It has really high quality DAC chips that deliver a truly awesome sound.I am now remastering all my old projects through this new sound card.Unbelieveable Improvement of Sound!!!"
5,Delicious and masterful playing!,"Tony, ( I guess I can call him by his first name, as I have had a chance to meet him) plays with years of skill and flare on this album. If you want to hear some enlightening and passionate banjo and guitar playing, pick this one up! In a world of ""Wonder bread"" pop music, Tony's album is a refreshing, wholesome, satisfying change! PS: Did I mention he is more talented then Bela Fleck.......? Well, he is! =)"
5,Tony is the man.,"Love his Zoo Bar (Lincoln, Ne) ""Tony Furtado Band"" Bootleg. [sick] banjo, cowboy-punk! Not sure if it is legal, but if bluegrass wanted to start selling live recordings, I'd buy them."
3,"good idea, not for all phones","If you intend to use this on a motorola v323, I would say pass up this product. Because the battery door on the back of this phone is of a poor design, the krusell kit makes it worse. I have had the battery door unlatch and my phone fall to the ground countless times while wearing this belt clip.Another problem is when using the swivel clip, it likes to squeak as you walk. I don't like excess noise when I walk. I find it annoying. Lately it hasn't been doing it, so maybe it's just a break -in period thing.I purchased this with the intention of using it with the carholdic kit. I have yet to find a suitable place to mount the car piece, but I think it is still a good idea. Multidapt system in general is very nice."
2,Childish,"This book and all the ""Stake Your Destiny"" series are good reads if you are under 14 years old. Most Buffy fans are older than 14. For older readers it is a let down. I am a huge Buffy and Angel fan, and most of the books have been great, (I own all the novels that are available) but I was disappointed in this book."
4,Keep me in mind.,"Keep me in mind is a fun choose your own adventure book based on the second season of Buffy the vampire slayer. The series, Stake your destiny, has four quick reads in which you are the slayer and every action is up to you. But be careful what you choose, because it has a magor impact on your story.This book was one of the better stories in the Stake your destiny series though some parts were strange the rest was fun. Great for any big fans of the show.(Colony (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"
3,Older Versions more comprehensive,"I have the 1992 version of this book. The 1992 version has a MUCH better history taking section & differential diagnosis section.The current edition is also missing common topics seen in ward medicine: ascites, alcoholic liver disease, peritonitis, and alcohol withdrawal to name a few.Too bad, the 1992 version was a great book, I carried it for years as a med student & resident, & still have it."
1,Just doesn't work,"This worked well on an older PC, but does not work on current versions of XP: you just get a message regarding inappropriate sound drivers and gracefully exit. There is nothing relevant in the readmes, and no online help from the firm.A few days after I wrote this I tracked down the company, now Global Software Publishing. There is a patch which will fix the XP problem at: [...] Turn off virus protection software first. Still no reason why Max OSX isn't supported even though the package says it is, but apparently buying an upgrade to version 1.2 might fix that problem."
1,Don't bother,"I bought two for the kids for summer camp because it had the ice pack. Your sandwich, which goes in the bottom, can't have lettuce or anything that will give it any bit of height because it will get ""smooshed"" by the ice pack. The bottom really doesn't allow for enough salad either. Small space. I have never put them in the dishwasher but the lids never go back on and if by chance you get them on (the little compartments) you break your fingernails trying to pry them off again. The outer lid has never gone back on again. The elastic method, mentioned earlier, works well. The ice pack, however, works well in keeping things cold. It would be worth it to spend a little more on a better product."
4,"Good, but the lid has issues when frozen","This container is good, but the lid issue said on reviews before is true.In a overall experience it's satisfactory, i would recommend.People at my work were all asking where did I get it from..."
1,Disappointing quality; tops rendered useless after a single washing,"I've now bought and used practically every Fit & Fresh food storage item, including this one, and can back the claims about the tops becoming warped and unusable after a single run through the dishwasher (top rack). This line held such great promise, but really fell down where it counted. The only Fit 'n Fresh product I've not experienced this problem with is the Healthy Food Snacker, and that's because that lid screws on. I've resigned myself to going back to Lock n' Lock containers, which don't feature the built-in coolers but which at least feature flawless sealing and locking capabilities, no matter how many times you run them through the dishwasher, on ANY rack. I'll go back to throwing them in a Built NY neoprene bag, with standalone cooling insert. I wish I could find a manufacturer who could get this one right."
2,Lid problems,"I bought this to bring my lunches. I love the portion control, cause you can only fit so much into the smaller containers. However, I have noticed that it's not very good for soups. The smaller containers leak. I have not put these into the dishwasher. I am definitely looking at getting another lunch box."
1,Not a keeper!,"I bought this thinking I could use it for sending a salad and some sides with my husband to work. It's just not large enough for much of a salad in the bottom compartment. Also, I don't like the fact that if I pre-dress the salad for him, the oil gets all over the ice pack, which is only hand-washable.Also, after ONE washing in the top rack of the dishwasher, the top lid does not seal completely. So now the whole thing is more or less useless. I'm probably donating it to the thrift shop.Not a bad idea, but it wasn't large enough or durable. Pity. I love their drink shaker bottles and plan to order more of those."
3,Useful,"This was an odd little book; I purchased it to read to the people I work with, Alzheimers / dementia. They get a kick out of it and sometimes sparks a memory."
4,Excellent Investment,This car base makes taking baby with you so much easier! Once you get the base installed all you have to do is place the infant seat in the base and go. We have a base in each of our cars so we don't have to move the base from car to car. We did find that it did not work well in one of our cars because the seat angle was too steep so I would suggest testing it out in your vehicle before you buy it.
5,"Beautiful Baths, Beautiful Book!","I love this book, and was looking to see if I could re-sell this book, as I have had it for awhile and have finished my bathrooms (three) but going through it again, I have to keep it!The photos and design work is excellent, and the text is really great with a wonderful ""thank you"" to those people that inspired the author (her parents). I would have loved to have had parents like this, and Susan Maney's eye. She's done a wonderful job with a number of books that I expect to continue to buy as I always have. Keep up the good work! * * * * *P.S. The negative review(er) must be referring to another book, as the photos in this one are really beautiful AND inspiring."
4,Power Paki,"Mr. Foot did extensive research before writing the book. Its a good book to read if u want to read the nuclear history and development of the weapons in South Asia. Although the author leans highly toward the Indian case and tries to white wash any and all of their acts, a criitcally aware reader can easily see through it. Recomended to all."
3,I don't know what to think.,"I'll begin by stating that I haven't played the game, but I read this book anyway. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The plot was slow and extremly predictable. You knew who's side every one was on after reading half the book, and I think this was supposed to be a surprise. Well, if it was, the author did a brutal job of keeping this quiet. Anyway, this book was essentially a tragic love story set in the Star Wars universe. It had no bearing on the overall plot of Star Wars. Having seen the movies, we know that the events of this book have no lasting effect in the Star Wars universe. On top of this, Luke, Leia and Han are out of Character. The best portrayal was Lando. Unless you're a dire fan, I'd skip this book. It won't help you to understand or know anything new or interesting in the Star Wars universe."
5,Enjoyed it!,"This was, as some have already said, a fun, fast read and it tied in with the game very well. This is definitely a part of the expanded universe and was meant to be linked with the game. I read somewhere that is why Lucas folks used a screenshot (albiet a dumb one)for the cover...so you'd understand it was associated with the game. Unlike another reviewer, I didn't think there were that many ""in"" jokes, but I liked the ones that were there since it was written for people like me, playing the game.I liked it. Does that mean you will? How would I know? But if you enjoy a relatively light adventure and like the game, I'm pretty certain you'll like the book, too!"
1,Brian,"Normally, I love the star wars books, and have prided myself on reading every single book at least twice. I can't even finish this. It took me a month to get to page 200 because I didn't even want to pick the book up. The writing is bad, the plot is bad, and it had so much potential. It took 200 pages to get to a point, and I don't recommend that any read this. Not a normal recommendation from me for a star wars novel."
2,Mediocre Star Wars at its best.,"I play the game and I love it, but this book was a grind getting through, the plot was ok and the ending was above average, but overall the story suffered from a rushed and low budget feeling, and this is a book, not a B movie!My recommendations is do not buy/read unless you are a hardcore SW fan. It's a waste of time/money."
5,Very good price/performance for this case,"This case is not very fancy but it gets the job done and does it very nicely. Lots of space to put all your components. I did not feel any restricted due to non-removable MB tray. The documentation was light, could have been a little more detailed. Even though it was my first built, I had little issues using this case.Shipping was FAST. Ordered it on Aug-21 and received it on Aug-23."
4,Romance and crime in one,"Well, I confess I had to read this book twice through, because I wasn't able to understand the crime plot for the first time. And after that it still seemed to me that I missed something. But I'm not surprised by that - I'm sure not the whole novel was translated into our language. It is common practice with Woodiwiss's books, unfortunately. That's way I decided to buy The unrecognized love"" (that is the title in Slovak) in English and via amazon.com! I like the story much, though sometimes it was a little bit unbelievable. But very good written - in the second part of the book I really didn't know whether the woman was Lierin or Lenora! It deserves 4 stars and attention of every Woodiwiss fan. Nice!"
2,Disappointing Follow-up to Volume 1,"Volume 1 provided great value and a number of entertaining and/or quality songs from several solid bands and singers. Volume 2 was clearly an effort to incorporate more ladies into the act, which need not be a problem given the array of talented singers out there these days, but, unfortunately, the songs selected for this Volume are like lyrical Nytol. This volume lacks both fun and substance, and, to put it plainly, I would not put this on if I was just hanging out with my friends having a few beverages unless it was part of a dare or I wanted to hint that it was time for them to leave."
4,A Series of Useful Tips and Tools for Microsoft Excel,"""Excel Hacks"" is a useful and easy-to-follow book. Excel is used for a wide array of tasks in today's corporate and educational environments. While Excel is used widely, its full range of utility is, based on my own experience, not utilized by a large percentage of Excel users.This book covers versions of Excel preceding Excel 2007, and Excel 2007 offers an expanded range of formatting tools and options that diminish the need for some of the hacks in the publication. That being said, this book is a worthwhile investment for all Excel users.For those readers who use VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) with Excel, there are a number of hacks in this book that lend themselves to quick and useful extensions into code."
2,Marginal Performance,Machine does start and stop when phone is off/on the hook. Hookup and operation is simple and straight forward. Playback speed is slower then recording speed therefore the voice is distorted. This is a two speed machine but the slow speed is not half speed as you would expect. I estimate that the slow speed is about 2/3 the speed of normal speed. This make it difficult to playback on a different machine unless the playback machine has a varible speed adjustment. The Manual states that the highest capacity tape that can be used is 90 minute and on slow speed that is about 1 hour per side.
5,Love it!,"I bought this gate to keep my dog off of the livingroom carpet when we leave the house. We bought a fabric retractable gate before this one, and our dog scratched holes and chewed through it. I bought this one knowing he could not chew through the hard plastic, or jump over the extra tall gate. He has scratched the gate, and the gate held up wonderfully. I make sure to put the tension bar on the inside, so the dog cannot chew it or use it to climb over the gate. It is easy to put up and take down quickly when I leave the house. I use it every day, and am very happy with my purchase."
3,Big dog. Big gate.,"I used this gate for my dog who had seperation anxiety because it didnt have the mesh holes.. He did one of his expiodes while I was gone at work and I came home to a metal piece on the floor and some of the wood chewed off. The gate was still standing up though, some how my 55lb dog (who stands about 5'5 when on his back legs) didnt tear this thing down. Before I got the gate I was moving my couch in front of the kitchen and somehow he would manage to leap over the couch and the bar stools I had stacked on the back on the couch to try and keep him in the area. Big fail. He did dent the plastic a little, or maybe he was scratching really hard at it. Either way, the gate held up. The only thing I cant stand about the thing is if you have to constantly put it up or take it down. Since I had to get the tall size for a big dog, I couldnt just step over it. It became a big pain but I also gated him in the kitchen. Would recommend for a calmer dog that is tall and big."
2,My dog cut her paw on the plastic barrier,"My little terrier was jumping at the gate and the plastic slivered and ended up cutting her paw. We left her there for an hour while we were out for lunch and came back to a bloody gate. I cannot recommend this gate for dogs who may be exciteable and try to get out of the gated area, the purpose we had the gate to begin with."
1,NOT FOR LITTLE DOGS WHO ARE JUMPERS!!!,"My 11 month old Havanese was able to jump over (and escape) from a gate I have that is 24"" high. Thus, I bought this one, which is about 30"", to keep her from escaping. Very BAD idea! We left her for only one hour and I think she was probably trying to jump over the gate for the whole time. When we came back home, although she was thrilled for us to return, she was hurt and walking a bit stragely. We took her to the vet the next morning, who told us she had luxating patellas, probably due to trying continuously to jump over this gate! So, now it's a ""waiting game"" for us to see if she needs surgery!Needless to say, this gate is not for jumping dogs!"
5,The playing peices fall apart,The playing pieces should be plastic like the actual game sorry Maby the can be shaped like pokemon figures too This game already costs more than the original so it should be as durable as the original Made to last instead of made to fall apart after a few plays.
5,Great virus fighter,"We take this most of the year to combat viruses, to prevent them, to fight them off quickly - we use this as an alternative to chemical based over-the-counter products!"
4,Deep language,Great book that looks into a lot of interesting topics. Definitely more of a scholarly book than a normal reader.
3,Speaker wire connectors are cheap,"I was looking at the entire series of JVC receivers, the 205, 211, 302, 411 and 702. I almost got a 211 but I noticed the speaker wire connectors on the back are the cheap push in clamps. Those tend to break off bits ofwire and cause short circuits. The 702 uses the good screw down connectors. The 402 uses half of each! I strongly suggest you go to jvc.com, click on support, enter the model number and download the owners manual before buying. The description on Amazon only scratches the surface. Otherwise these look like good electronics although I would get a lower end model since they will all shortly be obsolete."
2,Not what I expected,"This items says it is a wireless upgrade which is not exactly true. All it does is have the back speakers plug into it so that the wires don't run across your room to the actual surround sound system. It's not worth the price in my opinion. Though with that said I'm not returning it, so take the review however you like."
5,Heavy going but worthwhile,"I have to wonder if the critics giving Dennett one star read the same book I did. I will grant that the book is very wordy and slow-moving in places. It is the kind of read where you need to put it down and think about what you've just read. The arguments are sometimes very tedious, but then the notion of a central observer and Cartesian Theater are hard to shake.As a former computer specialist now happily retired, I particularly resonated with his parallel processor with serial software idea. My own master's work was in AI and I was fascinated by neural networks and the (few) attempts at duplicating them (Thinking Machines comes to mind.)I'm eagerly looking forward to reading some of Mr. Dennett's other books and will gladly set aside the time needed!"
1,Factual and logical Errors,"An interesting read about the subject is Ramachandran's article: ""Filling in Gaps in Logic: Some Comments on Dennett"", easilly found on the intenet.Ramachandran underlines some of Dennetts factual an logical mistakes."
1,This book is waste paper.,"And so is any book that purports to ""reduce"" consciousness to something else. If you enjoy handwaving, you'll enjoy watching Dennett try to deny the very existence of obvious features of experience (in his chapter ""Qualia Disqualified""). His work is surely the *reductio ad absurdum* of all attempts to ""explain"" mind in terms of matter. If this is how a religion-hating ""philosopher"" like Dennett ""explains"" consciousness, give me religion any day; it requires a lot less faith than this junk!"
5,A True Delight,"I savored every word, as if a delicious meal. I didn't want it to end. A very sweet and visual read. The village and villagers came to life in front of my eyes. I can't imagine a summer trip to France without a stop in Castelnaud, and a meal with Betsy and Michael. Two Thumbs up from me."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK WITH ZERO INSIGHT,This book is not worth the paper it is written on. Contains no substance and is simply a marketing tool for a doctors business.
2,Strong Smoke Flavored Cooked Salmon,"I increased this rating to 2 stars because the product was edible, the wood packaging is beautiful, and considering the number of 5 star reviews, it is apparent that others found this salmon satisfactory.My family and I are used to and prefer cured salmon that's closer to Lox which I make myself sometimes. This product appears to be cooked by heat or smoking and has a real strong smoke flavor. Unfortunately because of this no one in my family would eat this product."
3,Great shave Bad shaver,"Sadly I love this shaver. I have bought 3 in the last several years of which: one broke in half, one the head would no longer attach, one the fasteners that hold the head on both snapped off. Repairing one with the parts warehouse I have amassed with another head and then the rechargable batteries failed. I have no choice now but to give up on this shaver. It gives one of the fastest shaves with the fewest passes and does really well on difficult neck stubble. I have tried a braun 360 and it didn't compare with this remington so I am sad to lose it. Other issues: noisy, base cleaner doesn't do a sufficient job, do not clean the base with water or the motor will freeze up use alcohol."
1,did last,"I had for about 6 months and the battires quit holding a charge and over all the shave was never very good, I would not buy this shaver again nor would a I recomend this to anybody."
2,Not so good,"I had high hopes for this shaver, however, I am sad to inform you, that the shaver is extremely noisy, has heavy vibration, the shaver screens are easily damaged, and two plastic pieces which hold the shaving head to the shaver break easily. Additionally, the cleaning system doesn't really work so good. Lastly, the shave is not nearly as close as it should be for the price."
3,"High on hiking areas, low on detailed description","This book provides instructions for many hikes around Las Vegas not described in other guides. I have hiked many of these trails and always find the guide's desciptions inadequate. In fact, while hiking Bridge Mountain, following the Guide's instructions lead my experienced partner and I into a very dangerous situation. I still use the guide, but know that I will have to use my trail finding experience to augment the book's trail descriptions."
1,WRONG WAY!!!,"HORRIBLE would be the best way to describe this book. If you want a book that will help you navigate the trails of Las Vegas, then this IS NOT the book for you. Two weeks ago we tried several of the Hikes and were lost within minutes. The direction are off and mis-leading! When one of the hikes says turn southwards at the fork in the road...we did. What it failed to say was that there was another fork in the road a few meters up the road. TOTALLY MIS-LEADING!"
1,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"From the first pages, which speak of Celts in India and druids teaching karma, it was clear that D.J. Conway knows little about authentic Celtic tradition. This book is an amalgam of New Age fluff, from aromatherapy to eight-spoked wheel. There is very little here that could be considered Celtic.If you are interested in Celtica, I recommend _Celtic Heritage_ by Rees & Rees. For authentic Celtic rituals, try Kondratiev's _Celtic Rituals_. If you are interested in shamanism, try Vitebsky's book or Harner's _The Way of the Shaman_."
2,Misadvertising,"The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems. HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM. Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner. The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment."
4,Nikon Battery,Works well and great for the price. Battery life is a little shorter than top model but price is half.
1,Nikon EN-EL3a Rechargeable baterry failure,I purchased the Nikon EN-EL3a Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery about a month ago for a spare. The first time I used it in my Nikon D50 the camera gave an error message. I retried a few times and it continued to cause error message on the camera. I called Nikon and they advised me that the battery was bad and to return it to the seller. I emailed Amazon last week and have not heard back from them. Hopefully they will replace it.
2,Better choices elsewhere in the Brinkmann family,"This smoker is very similar to another in the Brinkmann line, the Brinkmann Gourmet, which sells for half the price at local retailers. The Gourmet also has a side door, allowing easier access to the water pan and charcoal pan during long cooking periods. You can no doubt make some excellent barbeque on this model, but you can do the same thing for half the price with the green Gourmet charcoal smoker."
2,Place it back on the shelf!,"Fellman attempts a survey of sorts of Robert E. Lee's musings on a myriad of topics. As usual with political correct revisionism, Lee's OWN thoughts don't get in the way of Mr. Fellman's own bias and conjecture. Sure to be a big hit, however, with those of an anti-Southern slant."
1,"Lackluster, anti-climactic","BEWARE!!!The other reviews of this movie use words that would normally describe something intriguing, something that builds itself up to a giant mystery, only to be answered in the last 20 minutes of the film. But sadly, this is not the case with ""Cropsey.""This movie, although very sad, has no real weight to speak of. Cropsey gives you little more than a brief background of the events that took place in the 80's involving some missing children who were never found. Bottom line, if you really want to know what happened here, don't waste an hour and a half and 3 bucks, read a short article and that will tell you more than what you get here.In conclusion, if you like watching people stumble around in the woods, asking viewers rhetorical questions, with no real direction or destination, then this is the movie for you!!!!!!! For everyone else, keep looking. . ."
1,another documentary movie,this movie although very sad is very weak. I don't know why it's in the horror section. It was very hard to watch.. I wish I didn't
4,"Simple, Easy, Reliable","I use this RF switch to toggle my HDTV between the STB and its own tuner. Allows me to receive over the air HD channels for free. Manual operation only isn't a problem as it is aways within easy reach on my desk. Inexpensive, easy to install and utterly simple. Well worth the price."
3,Eh,"Fun toy for little kids to play with. Worked great in the beginning but is falling apart now. The side bullet cover broke off and its hard to the gun now. I never used rubber bullets with it but my little brothers still had a lot of fun with it and still play with it.Overall, if you're just looking for a little toy gun that can and make a popping sound, go ahead and get it. If not, look for something more durable."
4,Good,"I recently just received this item, I thought it would come with rubber bullets -- boy was I wrong. But it's still fun to use."
2,coat spray,"If you have a light coated breed I do not recommend this product. It accumulates quickly in the coat, changes texture and weighs it down."
5,Lovely and elegant,"I bought this shawl to wear for my evening wedding ceremony. It was elegant, soft, silky and warm - exactly what I wanted! Very happy with my purchase!"
5,review,"""Tenor Conclave,"" 1956, brings together four top tenors of contrasting styles: Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Zoot Sims, and Al Cohn. The result is a feast for serious tenor fans. And the three ""other tenors"" hold their own with Coltrane. Underappreciated Hank Mobley is particularly outstanding. His soft, subtle bop lines are a nice foil to Coltrane. Zoot and Al, Prez disciples, offer a further contrast. All four are in top form. A wonderful CD.Roy A., Bath NC"
3,Yellow and Blue truck,"I got this truck in Yellow and blue, I like it very much so does my little one, It would be so nice if we can choose our own liked colors from these 3. It is really good to play with in sand. I would recommend it."
3,Not as expected,"In the title it said ""(12)"" and I thought I was receiving 12 small trucks, but only 1 arrived. I think this is far too small and cheap to cost $12.99 so I returned it."
1,the unit,rip off how can you people send dvd with the wrong format to Australia I need my money back on all purchases
2,to much Fantasy,"When i read about ""the unit"" for the first time i was excited and couldn't wait to see the first episodes, but now im not sure that it was such a good idea to buy it. Its a bit too unrealistic to be realy good.The Characters are not authentic enough to really play there parts in the show. My comment, a bit to much fantasy and rah-rah patriotism for my taste. Not worth the money in my opinion."
3,interesting book,THis book was okay. It went over things about potty training that I already knew. Though it did offer a few tips that have seemed to speed up the process. The test was the most helpful.
2,nothing earth shattering,didn't find this book to be too helpful. didn't give any details that i couldn't figure out through everyday common sense of being a parent.
4,Very Pretty Designs,I have had this book for years. The designs are classic and could easily be adapted to other color schemes. LARGE EASY TO READ BLACK AND WHITE CHARTS.
3,Not for iPad,"I can't open the video on my iPad even though I have the current update. Disappointing, but the recipes seem interesting."
2,Where is Season 3?,"I logged onto Amazon for another title and this popped up because I have previously bought Seasons 1 and 2. Panicked because I thought that I had missed Seasons 3-13, I did a search for the missing Seasons and learned that they were not yet available. How mean! The wait between the releases of Seasons 1 and 2 was bad enough, now they do this? Argh! Since most of Season 14 is still on in reruns, I will pass on this item."
4,Why they release this before season 3,"It's quite simple why the latest season was released before continuing with the old ones. It's easier for them to release this now than 1/5/10 years later when the rest of the seasons are finally out. They can get interviews and commentary that is actually fresh on the heels of each episode/season rather than going back a decade later and trying to conjure up some old footage or try and get some of the actors to remember what was going on.As someone who plans on purchasing the whole collection as it comes out, this DVD is a quality edition to the current collection and gives you a fresh change of pace from the 2 older seasons and the seperate set of actors from that time period of the show."
4,Why Skip all the way to season 14,I didn't start watching law and order til season 8. I Brought seasons 1 & 2 and I don't like missing what is in between with the characters.. I think they should not have jumped forward.However saying that I am going to buy this season.. But who watches the beginning of a movie and then fastforward to the end. As said they should not have jumped forward.
3,answer pleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaasee,"all i want to know is WHERE THE BOOK TOOK PLACE??? where did she live at the very beginning????? i read this book for american lit.....well half of it, i couldn't finish the thing in a whole month......someone PLEASE answer this!!! thanks"
2,It could have been written in 150 pages,"Unrealistic, how can such criminal avoid to becaught? The fight to Asian mafia by maincharacter is too naife.Robin seems to have picked up an up to date topicand written a book with poor plot."
2,So-so,"This book started off with a lot of promise. I received this book as a hand-me-down - I get many of my books this way - but the story quickly unraveled. Rather than stick with medicine, there's now espionage and attempted murder. While a good thriller can have medicine and murder all in one, this book is unfortunately not one of them.I found myself plodding through the book, quickly reading it just so I could get to the end. This is the first Robin Cook book I have read, and from what I see in the reviews, this is not the best work. I might pick up another Cook book, but if I ever buy one, I will make sure to check the reviews first. The ending to this book was unsatisfying and disappointing, with no real solution. The whole conspiracy of the Women's Clinic was interesting, but fell flat on delivery in this book. It might provide a diversion in the waiting room or on a airplane, but really, it's not worth reading."
2,"Hokey and Predictable, and a Wild Goose Chase","This book was okay as a vacation cabin read, but it is not one of Robin Cook's best. I found the plot pretty much predictable, in that the clinic was obviously trying to drum up business by creating a market, and then stringing the customer along to milk them for more cash. It only takes a couple hundred pages before the heroine of the story even gets close to that idea. She also falls for some of the lies quite easily, although she was suspicious about a coverup and evil intentions, she doesn't grok the obvious motive and means until the last few pages. The entertaining part is the traipsing through the clinic, breaking into the computer, and then off to Australia while chased by two bumbling hit-men, and then the heroine and her alter-ego trying to make contact with the triads (the number of watches they went through), before finally figuring out what the Chinese doctors do best. A good rainy day read, but not much of a mystery."
4,"Good value, decent belts","These are decent quality OEM belts, and the free shipping with amazon prime makes them a very good value. Not the easiest belts to find, it saved running around to stores &/or calling, and fresh belts definitely improve the brush action on my central vac power head unit. Longevity seems pretty good. I'd recommend replacing them regularly (depending on your usage of course) at this price to keep brush head performance as good as possible."
3,Tight fit,This hoster when first opening it seemed a little tight but after playing with it seemed to loosen up a bit. I was afraid of damaging my light because of tightness but it seems to be easier everytime you use it.
3,15 Days,"I'm giving this item 3 stars since that seems to be a ""medium"" rating. In actual fact I didn't even open the box. When I ordered it from Amazon the price was $49.99 less a $45 rebate which would bring the final price to $4.99. Not bad. HOWEVER, when I read the fine print on the rebate sticker on the box (thankfully before breaking the seal) I discovered that the rebate reqest must be postmarked no more than 15 days from the date on the receipt. Since the date on an Amazon packing slip is the date of the original order it was already too late to submit the rebate. I phoned McAfee customer service and asked if an exception could be made. After being given another number to call the answer was ""no."" So I returned it. It wound up costing me postage and I'm sure Amazon would have preferred to have a sale rather than a return. I went to a store and bought Norton's equivalent software. After their costing both me and Amazon time and money I at least deprived McAfee of the sale."
1,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware.I installed Internet Security yesterday and found that emails from eFax are automatically being deleted from Outlook and I can't find them any more. I am an efax customer and these are important emails. So I tried contacting customer service for help. McAfee's customer service is really really bad. Unless you want to pay $2.95/min, the only way to get help is via IM. And IM hold times are north of 15 minutes. The one time I did connect with customer service on IM, the connection disappeared after the initial ""hello how can I help you"".So what am I going to do? I'm going to get a security package from someone else first thing tomorrow, uninstall McAfee and live with the fact that some of my email has been deleted. Of course this is the last McAfee product I'll ever buy."
4,review of insiders guide to usmle step 2,"this book was decent, it contained pertinent info for taking step two. the material is organized in a proper and stepwise format. also, it is relatively cheap."
3,The Still of Night,Kept your interest. Part of it was uninteresting. Would buy more books by the same author. Price was a little less than in bookstore.
5,I shared a story,"A few years ago I wrote to one of Jessica Heriot's colleagues sharing my experiences in dealing with PTSD. It came out more like an essay, and my response was an offer to be included in this book. I was so pleased! I received a copy of it upon completion, and I am honored to have been made a part of such an amazing collaboration. This book is all firsthand experience with different types of trauma. You can't get anymore real than that."
3,take more than this book with you,"Whitney provides a great number of interesting hikes for your adventures, but don't take his word on everything. Be sure to take a topographic map and get advice from park rangers before heading out on day hikes or backpacking trips. I have used Whitney's books on numerous hikes and have found discrepancies on water availability and I disagree avidly on his opinion of ""a great hike"". He is accurate on difficulty ratings and distances, but check with the visitor's center to verify water sources and directions for the trail or route and MOST IMPORTANTLY, get recommendations from people who have recently hiked your choice of trails."
5,The Stellar Ms. Jackson and her Literary Potpourri,"I am a subscriber to the Literary Potpourri Anthology and wait anxiously for the quarterly ""Mail Call"".Beverly Jackson has crafted a masterpiece of contemporary short fiction, poetry, and photographic imagery. The stories are the best out there and are guaranteed to provoke thought at every turn of the page. If Short Stories are making a comeback (and they are), Ms Jackson and Lit Pot are leading the charge.Give this one a try."
5,I love the blues!,This was a gift purchased for someone else. They thoroughly enjoyed and the book was in excellent condition. Thanks so much.
2,searching for robert,"It is to bad that someone so capable of telling a good tale could take a dive with such vivid subject matter at his disposal. It is extremely over priced for such a dismal read. Anyone who has purchased the Box set has read pretty much the same info given in this minute pamplet of wash. We need a vision of this man not a paint by numbers acount of times,places and song verses. Then again If you do not know the tale of johnson then this is the book for you. let me also highly recomend Robert palmers book Deep Blues. Also the finest attempt to give an acurate portrayal of such a god is the book LOVE in VAIN by Alan Greenberg..."
4,The 40 years of X-Men DVD-rom has great quality!,"This 40 years of X-Men DVD-rom has great quality! All the Uncanny X-Men issues you dream of having since you were kid to own is here! The DVD-rom also has the early Original X-Men issues that most people don't remember or own. (Uncanny X-Men#1-#93!)Also,You have most of Chris Claremonts 17-year run of the X-Men in this DVD-rom! ( X-Men Giant-Size#1, Uncanny X-Men #94-#277!)I wish it also had published X-Men (2nd series)#1-#3 with writer,Chris Claremont and artist, Jim Lee. That would have made this DVD-rom more complete. It's missing those issues.These Uncanny X-Men issues are great! Chris Claremonts finest work is here! There are some great artists who worked on this book including Neal Adams, John Byrne, Marc Silvestri, Whilce Portacio, & Jim Lee, etc.,I highly recommend this DVD-rom! It's great!"
2,You could get this somwhere else,"40 Years of the X-MenFirst lets get one thing staight i did not use this product, but i did buy it only to find out recently that there a website where u can see all these uncanny xmen comics and more. So thats why im wriing this review, the site is marvel digital comics digital unlimited, its not free tho but its a lot cheaper than this. So i hope this will save a couple people some bucks. thnks bye"
4,"Pretty good, but with a major flaw","The format is good, scans are pretty darn good(occasional hard to read bit), and it's a heck of a lot of fun reading these old things.Though, I must admit that I agree with a previous reviewer: the crossover events needed to be included. At least they should have been released to DVD-Rom at or around the same time, since they were a different comic book series. Either way, it's still a little lame.Overall though, five stars for quality, four due to missing material."
4,Good value.,"Very good deal for the price alone. I mean 40 years of X-Men comics. Oh Yeah!! One negative thing is the fact that this set does not contain the cross over issues within the 80s, 90s and 00s. So that is the only reason I rated this 4 stars. Oh well, still awesome bang for your buck."
3,Watch the movie instead,"This book is a near mirror image as the movie, with the exception of the first eight pages. There is more detail into the residents of the hospital then seen in the opening of the movie. Thats about all this book has to offer. There is no narritive into Michael's mind, or the writer letting you see things through the eye's of Michael as there was in the first book by Curtis Richards. There is a little more story added also to the oldman that gives Dr. Loomis a ride into Haddonfield, though it's nothing your missing out on. The book more or less is point A to point B in a straight line. No detours from the movie not even a little curve to add something new and exciteing from what we have seen. Do yourself a favor save yourself some money and stick with the movie. Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers movie is as good as the first in the series and without a doubt the last one really worth watching, the book however is not a must have unless you are a fanatic as me."
5,A wonderful book.,"Too bad information wasn't provided to us this way in school: utterly engaging, intelligent, funny, full of wise humor. Reading this is like eating potato chips except that its really good for you which is pretty amazing. Joel is hip and savvy."
3,Cute but heavy pink guns!,"My 5yr old ""cowgirl princess"" LOVES her pink guns and can't believe mommy found pink guns just for her. The belt is cute and nothing fancy but the guns are so heavy that it is hard to keep them on the belt. They aren't too heavy for her to hold and operate just too heavy to keep on the belt. But if she is wearing jeans or pants with belt loops we have figured out you can put it around one or two of them and it helps her keep them up."
1,what the heck are these?,"Ok, so I definitely agree with the other reviewers who are wondering what in the world these things are, they look more like slender airplane barf bags than vacuum bags. It's just a paper sleeve, I don't see much difference between using this and using a brown lunch bag. It seemed so ridiculous that I decided to put this thing INSIDE of the reusable one, hoping to grab at least some of the dog hair, etc. so that cleaning the other one won't be as bad."
4,Disposable bags.,"They are handy but very, very small. I would not buy again unless they were on sale for very low price since you have to change them so often. They do not hold enough. You do need the adapter kit. Cannot use the bags alone out of the package without the Disposable Bag Adapter Kit. But if you hate emptying the cloth bag you can try these. Hoover should try to make them bigger."
4,Great Price,"We shop around for price and these are the best. We buy in larger quantities, so price is an important consideration for us. These come exactly as advertised."
1,Just Awful,I was so disappointed this book. The story was awful. The lead character was pitiful. And the sex scenes were just down right nasty.
3,Great for the Price,"I own three ukuleles - - an Oscar Schmidt OU5, a Tyler Mountain banjo ukulele, and this one. If you put some Aquila strings on it, it gets a great mellow tone that you don't find with a lot of cheaper ukuleles. I really like the materials used in this model- - brass tuners (although the picture here looks a little different), wood fretboard, no gloss laminate. There's no splashy logo on the headstock, too, which is something that drives me crazy about Oscar Schmidt instruments. I think it's a good bargain.The gig bag is not great, it won't protect the ukulele from anything other than the faintest of scratches, but it's better than a stick in the eye.Crestwood ukuleles are tough to find, and I'm curious what other people think of them. I might be interested in checking out a concert-sized if they're available."
5,Excellent,Ordered this for my library collection.God Bless America!God Bless America!God Bless America!God Bless America!God Bless America!
2,Consider the Source,"Have any of you reviewers who are highly rating this series done your homework? You don't have to dig deeply to discover that David Barton is no historian, and that he takes many ""facts"" completely out of context to make his case. This series is not an honest scholarly treatment of history nor of historic documents. It falls more along the lines of propaganda designed to support a ""Christian grand narrative"" surrounding the wide-spread belief that the Founding Fathers were devout Christians who were following God's plan for a ""Christian"" nation. The series does present some useful information and some delightful historical nuggets, but separating them from the half-truths and flagrant out-of-context use of quoted material makes finding the historical truth in this series very difficult to the point that it presents somewhat of a danger to the casual viewer seeking a message of truth."
5,Excellent series,"Hear and see the truth about the true heritage of our country and the men and women who were involved. You be amazed at the difference between what you have been told and the actual truth. Many, many proofs and direct quotes from documents and letters. Should be shown in every history class room in this country."
2,I have had to reassemble this more times than I can count!,"My 5 year old got this for Christmas because she needed somewhere to store all of her pets. It looks really cute, but I was surprised when I opened the box. After several minutes of carefully punching out all the cardboard pieces, I got it together fairly easily. However, everytime my daughter plays with it, it falls apart. If my 2 year old has been in the room, it is practically destroyed. After putting it together over and over and over, I finally decided to add some tape to hold it a little better. That helped some, but not much. It is really cute, and my daughter loves it (when it's together), so that is a plus."
1,Lousy... Not Worth the Wait Nor the Hype,"This console turned PC title has been one of the biggest disappointments to date. This PC title had been delayed many months, and for what? Ubisoft took their sweet time [doing what?] just to release a shoddy product. What kind of software exists that doesn't integrate use of the [universal] mouse? Why are the keyboard controls so complicated? The gameplay is hurt from this lack of foresight on the part of Ubisoft, which hurts the game considerably. The cinematic scenes look worse on the PC, when compared to those of consoles.Just purchase a console and the game. After all, it was originally meant for a CONSOLE, NOT a PC."
1,Not good for pc,"This game is really only for x-box and not for your PC. To tell you the truth, it stinks on my pc. Waste of money."
1,BADDDDDDDDDD,First of all this game has no mouse control at all.To fire your weapon you have to press shift and enter at the same time and you have to use another 2 buttons to line up your shot.All other games do all this just using the mouse.That aint all every action you take you have to use 2 or 3 buttons to do it.It is not a free roaming game.You are on a path if you try to walk off of it you can't.Very linier game play and really bad controls.I just bought this game and am putting it up for sale.It is obviousley a console game adapted to get the pc dollars
2,Terrible PC Port,"I bought this to play an old favorite from my Gamecube days to try to recapture some nostalgia of one of the best games I had ever played. I was sorely disappointed. The graphics are not just dated due to the game being 5 years old, but they come across on the PC much worse than were I to dig my Gamecube out of storage and hook it up to my TV. The lack of mouse control is a big miss. The keyboard controls feel funky and the gamepad controls feel delayed. The whole port itself is a big disappointment. If you've never played this game before and have the urge to get through a great story and great innovative (for its time) gameplay, then buy all means pick it up. If you're trying to replay and old favorite, avoid it, as it might ruin your memories."
1,Junk!,"This is just plain junk, keeps folding closed as you try to use it. If you need a windshield squeegie buy the type the gas stations use."
1,"No metal, ONLY PLASTIC","Though I highly reccomend using a cleaning rod (after every time you play your flute), I do NOT reccomend metal ones. Metal will scratch the inside of your flute, (which I found out from experience). Please seriously considering just buying a plastic rod...yes they are more flimsy, but you shouldn't need anything to ""sturdy"". PLEASE RECONSIDER!"
1,Buyer Beware,"The packaging of this product seems delibertly designed to confuse the buyer. The product suggests that it can generate directions -- what it doesn't mention is that you have to go back to your computer each time to do so. You might as well use MapQuest! Other mapping products like Mapopolis and Tom Tom can actually do this. I finally decided to buy Mapopolis because it doesn't require a Tungsten T3 like Tom Tom (it doesn't even work on the T2 or Clie units) and have been happy with my purchase. It's a shame you can't return software, because I would love to send Rand McNally back ..."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"I had the audio-book edition & couldn't make it through the 4th tape (of 8). Except for the section about his time with Orson Welles, it was unbelievably boring, uninteresting & pointless. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Will & Grace,The product was purchased as a gift but the person I bought it for was satisfied. The sale process and receiving it was excellent. No problems
4,Loved it!,"My nephews are 6 and 10, the 6 yr old didn't watch very much of it, but the 10 yr old is practicing the enviromental tips right now....Came in great condition and quickly...Thanks!"
4,"So far, good buy",I have only had a few cuts to make so far but the tool seems to do the job as expected. Good construction and and the speed selection is a good feature. Constant on engagement of the trigger is tricky and really should have a seperate button to engage. I was shopping price and feel I got good value for the low cost.
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,Not a heavy duty machine but of course you have to pay for that. For home use it is fine. I have to return the first one i received because there was something wrong with the part that holds the blade. Amazon quickly sent a replacement and the second was ok.
4,Good basic GPS,"It works very good, lacks of some POIs like starbucks, and you have to wait around 5 minutes for the system to acquire gps signal. But it's a good gps to start."
5,Great GPS,"I thought this item would not be as accurate and quick as more expensive ones, but I am pleasantly surprised that this is very accurate as far as locating you, and very, very fast to correct a wrong turn and recalculate a new route. It takes some time to type destinations using the keypad in ABC format, but commonly used locations can be saved in memory (as far as I understand; at least HOME can be saved, with recent destinations saved). The unit warns you verbally and graphically of upcoming turns. I would highly recommend this to anyone afraid of getting lost, as long as you don't mind not hearing the name of the street you have to turn next at. You can take a quick glance at the top of the screen for the name, so it is one con I found. Otherwise a great value product."
1,rothco g.i. type o.d. d-cell flashlights,very bad misrepresented quality. it is not what i needed nor expected. a very big waste of money. bad replica of the original. it had no colored lenses.
5,a great old time fiddler,Ralph is one of the old time Appalachian fiddlers. He is 80 years old and still strong. I heard him in concert last night playin with the same back up as on this album(they have been together 15 yrs). Good stuff!
4,Michael Fan,"After owning most of Michael W. Smith album's, this is a good CD but to me it is not the best one he has accomplished. There are a few good songs on the album. This is one is also more laid back, it is as if he is tending to more of slow songs these days. Probably because he has been working on the Worhsip Cd's and ever since then things became slower. I cannot complain though. I love his music especially his older CD's. He continually inspires me through his music."
2,Smitty Lays an Egg,"Big MWS fan here since 1990. This is the one blemish on a career I'd call nothing but remarkable and well deserved. There is just nothing here that is accessible and moves the listener. I have tried but do not share the sentiments of others regarding this release. Reviews seem largely mixed here. Starts bland and stays there the whole way through. Michael is a great talent that I have enjoyed immensely through the years but STAND mainly ""SITS"" idly in my cd cabinet. I'll revisit it every once in a while but it just simply fails to make it all the way through. Come on Smitty, we need a comeback on the next effort.DennisCT/USA"
5,Great Combo,I had these movies on VHS and was very happy to find them on a combo pack in DVD. I purchased this item for my children who loved watching them over and over again.
4,Good Family Entertainment,"I thought these were a good big-screen adaptation of the cartoon series. They did a good job selecting the cast as well, in my opinion. The atmospherics in the film were very reminiscent of the cartoons themselves, and the sets were done well too. I'm not sure I would advise that kids under the age of 12 view the first movie due to the supernatural premise behind the plot, which may frighten little ones some. Other than that, on the whole, these were entertaining. I would add in closing that the movies run a little shorter than the typical film (less than 90 minutes), but they manage to deliver pretty solid entertainment in that timeframe."
4,My Son LOVES it!!,My son is a HUGE Scooby-Doo fan and I have been searching everywhere for these movies for him and couldn't find them. This double disc purchase was perfect and he watches it over and over and over!! Very satisfied with my purchase!!
1,BRATZ SUCK! BARBIE IS WAY WAY BETTER!!...............,"I HATE THESE DOLLS! THEY ARE SOOO UHHGLY AND INAPROPRIATE IT'S INCREDABLE!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GIFT FOR A CHILD UNDER 8 I DO NOT RECOMEND BRATZ! [...] I RECOMEND THE ""WEE 3 FRIENDS"" DOLLS WHICH HAVE WAY LESS MAKE-UP AND JUST OVER-ALL, DON'T LOOK LIKE STREET CHCIKS MORE LIKE GOOD, BEUTIFUL TEENS.......PLEASE, PLEASE-FOLLOW WHAT I SAY! I'M BEGGING YOU! YOU'D JUST BE WASTING MONEY ON BRATZ!! BY THE WAY I'M 12!"
2,"fair price, but too large","These peanuts are about 3/4"" in diameter several times the size of the wasabi peanuts I got elsewhere (sadly that source no longer stocks). The result is that the wasabi almost completely overwhelms the peanut flavor. The smaller ones (about about 1/4"" diameter) had the right flavor balance."
1,Piece of Junk,Bought this watch and in less than 12 hours it went blank on me after getting in 4 feet of water at the pool. Never gad a problem with G-Shocks until this one. Even the salesperson didn't understand it since it is rated at 200wr.
3,Intriguing,"Once I settled into the ""rhythm"" of this book, I found it very readable. Due to the juxtaposition of past and present, I initially had a difficult time sustaining an impression of anyone except Harry and Ruth. Their continuation in each other's lives for more than 50 years was believable and touching, and I found the ending to be poignant and in keeping with the tenor of their story. The characters are well defined and believable, and there are some unexpected plot surprises. This book is a testament to the impact of the written word, as witnessed by the long-enduring ""pen-pal"" status of the two characters."
2,Disappointing for a Howard Owen Book,"I have read three previous books by Howard Owen and loved them. This book, however, jumps back and forth from present to past so often that I can't tell what the characters' status is and what events have taken place already. The story is interesting but he could have written it with more continuity."
2,"A ""Doctorless"" Christmas Story","Very disappointing Christmas Story. The Doctor, who is supposed to be the lead character after all, does almost nothing in this story and it just seems to all happen around him. The story has little or no plot and is really just eye-candy. Very beautiful to watch but not much story to follow. Not even a villain for the hero to battle. It was as if the writer said ""let's just make a pretty story for the kids to watch on Christmas"". Well the kids and most fans of the show would like a little more, especially after all of the other wonderful Doctor Who Christmas specials that have come out over the years. I wouldn't waste your money on this one unless you are dying to see it and can find it at a cheap used price. Believe me, you won't want to watch it more than once."
3,Average thigh high stockings,"Definitely a nice looking stocking and feels good on. Unfortunately two wears is all I got out of these stockings. The second time I had them on several holes and ladders appeared. I won't be buying these again, I need more than 1.5 wears out of a pair of stockings!"
3,Not quite as good as the wide bands..,"I bought these thinking I was getting the wide lace band, which are very comfortable and sexy. These however, have a narrow silicone band that digs into the flesh....doesn't really hurt while wearing. but it's been two days and I still have welts..."
5,Great Product,"Great product. It can be difficult to find the right size and color in the store. Thankfully, I was able to purchase online. Elastic on thigh high band does not pinch like I've experienced with others and the product lasts."
2,Not for beginners,I am a beginner to real estate trying to understand pros and cons of real estate investment. I wanted a book which would explain me step by step on how I can start in a small way and grow big. This books starts big and talks about $2 million dollar investments. I do not want to take such a big step to begin my real estate investments. I would recommend reading 'How to Succeed and Make Money with your first rental house' for beginners in this business.This book is not worth reading even once.
1,beyond worthless,"This book should have been titles half of the letter a of real estate investing. I like most of the rich dad material but this is SO basic that it really doesn't teach you anything. And I mean anything. It absolutely baffles me that anyone can give this book a 5 star review, especially a so called 20 year investor. I have bought 5 pieces of investment real estate over the years so I am far from an expert but there was nothing in this book that I hadn't thought of before I bought my very first house. WAY TOO BASIC, with almost NO useful information."
5,great book!!!!!,"a lot of people criticizing the works ""rich dad company""they didn't know they only made them more powerful...robert kiyosaki is one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time, and his book ""rich dad poor dad"" in one of the greatestbooks align to the books of marshall loeb, donald trump,warren buffet, etc.... highschool dropout or college dropout is sometimes more millionaire or billionaire than anybody look atray croc, bill gates, john d. rockefeller, henry ford etc... they are so very rich!!!!"
3,Metal Bowl Set with lids,"I really like using these as they look good on the table and go with the dishes & glasses, but they are metal and do not go in the microwave so are really only convinient for cold type foods. Real easy to just stick the lid on and put leftovers in the fridge. Plastic bowls might be used more as they could go in the microwave to reheat."
4,Great foot tappin music with lots of melody to make you hop.,"Clawhammer style banjo has much more character than Blue Grass banjo. Walt seems to be a master at this kind of banjo playing although his singing is a bit scratchy it seems to fit this style of music. Every song on this CD is lots of fun and makes me want to tap my feet, clap my hands, drum on the desk and get up out of my seat and hop and dance around. My favorite song is Berkely Days. This is happy feel good music with lots of melody. It's Americana."
5,Bright and multi-cultural,"This story makes fun reading for youngsters with a good moral that sulking only leads to more of the same.Stephanie Roth's full bleed illustrations are the heart and soul of this book. Bright, sunny, multi-cultural and with a loving touch she transports us effortlessly from rooms looking down on the party smack into the spraying hydrant with the kids."
4,I like this scanner,"My old scanner quit working or so I thought. It turned out to be the power adapter that quit. I had it for 10 years, and I did a lot of scanning with it. It was also a Mustek but with the parallel port. So I thought I would buy a Mustek again since the first one worked so well. This new one is so much faster and scans very nice. I am into scanning old pictures, and it also works well just making copies that I need. The only thing that I have to work around is that I unplug the power when I am not using the scanner. The light will sometimes come on if your computer has to be rebooted, and you don't want the light staying on."
2,tedious,"I absolutely LOVED Palace Walk, and couldn't wait to read the second book of the trilogy. But unlike the first, I found myself reading the same page over and over again until I finally gave up. I don't understand it, because people I respect recommended this highly. But I just couldn't get into it..about halfway through, I realized that I had had enough of Al Saed Ahmad's philandering and Yasin's arrogance and Kamal's whining. Nothing seemed to change from the first book, it was just more of the same, so I wondered why did Mahfouz bother? What am I missing here?"
3,Not as good as Palace Walk,"A continuation of Palace Walk, the story seemed to drag on. I found Kamal's intellectual transformations interesting, but quickly tired of Yasin's escapades and the focus on men and their indiscretions with women. Mahfouz also used analogies sometimes to excess."
4,A History Buff's Film,"This 1973 teleplay dramatizes in an excellent fashion the events of October, 1962, when the United States and the Soviet Union came to the brink of nuclear war over the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles to Cuba. In almost documentary fashion, the film depicts the emotionally-charged process by which President Kennedy (William Devane) and his advisors tried to determine the American response that would get the missiles out of Cuba but avoid a nuclear war. Less attention (probably due to a lack of authoritative sources) is given to the reactions of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev (Howard da Silva), though the Soviet viewpoint is by no means ignored. For those who would like a detailed look at one of the most dangerous times in world history, I highly recommend this movie."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I agree with Robb Dunn's review above and can't believe people are so ga-ga over this author. I've read Don't Sweat The Small Stuff--and It's All Small Stuff, and I'm almost done with the Family book. In both cases you could almost skip the text and just read the chapter headings. I'm finding only one or two chapters in the entire book that are telling me something that isn't simple common sense. And in these chapters he gets to the point in the first few sentences and then just babbles on. Not worth the read."
4,Good stuff,Great book if you believe in being able to change how your day/lofe can go by thinking better... You have to be able to read this thinking that you can learn not to sweat it..
5,Short and Superb!,"This book has very short chapters. What this does is allows you to quickly get a thought-provoking and helpful ""shot in the arm"" almost anywhere. I find it a great book to keep in the car for reading during commutes when I am a passenger or even if stuck in traffic. Sure, some of the stuff is common sense but the way Carlson puts it - it really makes you think and makes it real. Definitely one to read and pass on to someone else."
2,Misleading description,"This is touted as a ""LARGE"" container. The only way it is ""large"" is if you are spacial-perception challanged. I don't think that any ontainer 5 inches by 3 inches can be considered ""large"". They should have posted the actual dimentions."
2,Barely Worked,"I usually wax my own facial hair with hot wax. That said, I'm very practiced at pulling the wax strips off with a quick and steady hand.I recently bought these strips while on vacation. I figured that they would be easy to use, as long as I followed the directions to a ""T."" I washed my face first, used the pre-treatment towelette, and gently massaged the strips and lightly placed on the trouble area. Yanked the strip swiftly and cleanly... and it came off without any hair. A second attempt left half the strip on my face, and the plastic backing in my fingers. I tried one more time, and ended up getting wax on 3/4 of my eyebrows and 1/4 of them on the strip.Just a poor product, if you need more than a few strays tweezed. Better off with shaving, hot waxing, or tweezers."
1,Not worth the trouble at any price.,"My tracfone worked great for about 3 weeks. Then one morning I received an ""unregisterd SIM"" message. I called customer service and I think that they said that it was a temporary problem in my area that would be fixed soon. I could barely understand the customer service representative so I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, my parent's have a tracfone and they live in the same area and theirs works. So I suspect customer service was just feeding me a line. I googled the problem and found that it is a common problem and that it is not worth the trouble to get it fixed, if you ever can. I'm trashing the phone and just considering it a lesson learned."
5,Tired of frying your hair???,"Remington's S2044 Ceramic Hair Straightener is top of the line. I've used other Remington hair straighteners with conditioners, etc., which resulted in fried ends. I had to cut off all the fried & frizzies and start from scratch with the S2044. I've been using it for over 6-months and I longer have fried & frizzies. I'm 68, have medium length & medium texture hair which is currently brown with the help of L'Oreal :)"
1,Didn't work,"I was excited to receive this straightener as my old one (FHI) was 4 years old, and I wanted one that I could control the temperature.It arrived quickly to my delight, and the next morning I plugged it in, and the screen began to flash. I pulled out the instructions, and it stated that was normal, as it flashed as it was heating up. 5 minutes later, it was cold, and still flashing. I tried a different outlet and still the same outcome.I didn't even want to exchange because of that."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I have the Remington Shine Therapy straightener and it works very well, so I thought this one might work well too, in addition to protecting my hair from the heat. Well, it doesn't straighten hair very well, so I can only imagine that by using the product for an even longer time trying to get hair straighter, my hair would get just as damaged. I will just stick to my old straightener."
5,Girlfriend loves it,My girlfriend has owned an expensive flat iron in the past that she left behind in Las Vegas. She loves this one and paid a fraction of the price her prior flat iron cost.
5,Just about perfect!,"This flat iron heats up in about 20 seconds to full heat (430). The teflon plates are great & leave my hair straight,smooth and shiny. Although the instructions don't tell you, you can lock in the heat setting by holding down the - button for a couple of seconds so that you don't accidentally change it while using the iron. I am so pleased after having to return two of the Remington S10-51 flat irons because they did not heat up beyond 375, althought they were supposed to go up to 430."
5,It lasted us over 18 months,This is a great hair iron and I'm writing this review after 18 months of good use. All good hair irons have a life span of about this much time and sadly its now time to replace it with a twin.
3,"It worked really well, but made my hair smell...","I thought that the fibers would cause more breakage to my coarse hair (I am african american), but it straightened perfectly :)The iron gets really hot and I like the digital screen and buttons.I bought the iron in 2010/2011, and stopped using it a few months later because of the smell it gave my hair.I don't know if it's the iron, the way the material reacts with my hair/products, or what but it was not pleasant! I've had other irons produce a weird smell before, but that was after I had had it for a few years.I recently gave the iron to my caucasian friend (straight, fine hair) who needed one and she had the same complaint: it straightens well, but produces a weird smell."
4,Works great!,"This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife. She has a CHI and says this one works just as well. As for the Damaged hair repair claim, who knows.. but as a low price straightener, this works well."
2,"Not worth the time, effort or money","First of all heat is not recommended for daily use on hair but because Remington claimed that ""The Remington Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat Iron features plates covered with ceramic fabric for 50 percent less hair splitting and damage. Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates. This added surface helps prevent hairs from rubbing against each other, thereby reducing a major cause of splitting and damage"" we decided why not give it a shot.The flat iron does heat up pretty fast but did not straighten my daughters hair, so she was constantly trying to redo portions of her hair. With all that heat being constantly applied to her hair, her hair started looking crunchy and frizzy which is what this is not supposed to do. Because of all the constant retouching it takes a very long time to get her hair done as well. So not worth the time and effort.I'm really surprised at all the glowing 5 star ratings but this just isn't for everyone."
4,Awesome CD for people who like Dance,"I've been impressed with the things MOS have put out. Granted this is not exactly the best album I have recieved from them, it's pretty damn good! If you like a good dance CD to add to your collection I would say this is a good start."
5,tunepower = more zune power,this is the best zune product enhancer yet.so far on one charge i've watched four full length movies all thirty of my music videos the whole season of a tv series listened to six full albums and still have enough charge on it to watch sixteen more videos.i truly love this product.you can't ask for anything better than this.
2,Not for Gears of War Edition,"I bought this for use with a Gears of War Special Edition Zune. DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE! The TunePower must be made for a different sized Zune. The hole for the hold button is in the wrong spot and the power connector that plugs into the Zune isn't aligned properly.Other than that, I am sure this is a great product, you generally can't go wrong with Belkin. Just don't get this for a Gears of War Edition. . ."
2,didn't last,failed after 6 months and i only used my printer a few times mostly black printing with this hp 95 color ink.they sell expirred ink cartridges it looks like.i always get three times the printing with store purchase because i use it at home just to print receipts when i pay bills on line..very dissapointed
2,High cost ink,"As with any ink cartridge, we are black mailed into paying way too much for what amounts to a small amount of ink. If not for the impact on landfills it sometimes is cheaper to buy a new printer then new ink."
1,Very disappointing,"I have purchased every book on baseball stadiums I can get my hands on. I have 10 different books on the subject and this one is by far and away the least informative of each one. The potential existed for Von Goeben to do a very nice book on the history of baseball stadiums, yet he chose the easy way out and did a book on the subject. Some authors take pride in their work and if Von Goeben takes pride in this one he should be ashamed of himself. Perhaps three or four pictures I have never seen before are in this book, all others are ones he regurgitatedfrom other vastly superior baseball stadium books. Save your money and purchase better books on baseball stadiums such as ""TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL PARK"" by Josh Leventhal (Make sure you get the updated Leventhal book) and ""AMERICAS BALLPARKS"" by New York City Firefighter Kenneth Hogan."
1,Rip Off!!,"I was frantic for a guide on making delicious and comforting meals for my son who has recently begun kidney dialysis. All the meals I had made for decades were no longer acceptable. When I went online looking for a book..the title of this one jumped right out at me. Though a little expensive, near $40 with S & H,I immediately ordered it. When I received it, I was stunned. I believe there are about 20 recipes in this book. Four of which are desserts, which a diabetic kidney patient cannot have. The breakfast ones are no brainers that anyone would already know how to make and that left about five recipes that were useful, but, again, not a stretch for my own cooking knowledge.I felt taken advantage of at a time when I was seeking help and I would not recommend this book to anyone who is searching for help at a troubled time, when emotions and finances are already stretched."
1,Terrible! Insipid remixes.,"Don't get me wrong: I love remixes, especially when they bring something different and exciting to a familiar favorite. But these remixes all manage to suck any excitement or ""edge"" out of the original version and wrap each in a bland, lifeless package that might just barely be good enough for an elevator."
2,No captions,"I was very disappointed to see there are no english captions for this season. as a mother of two small children, captions are often the only way I can truly understand what is going on. Also as someone with family members who are hard of hearing, it is strange that captions have been left off. Also lacking are special features. None. A cheesy TV commercial is all we get. Lacking all these things that every other season has had....I truly have to say this season is not worth it. And I own all the seasons. But it is the creators last season. Still. Sad."
5,Gilmore Girls,"This season was a very intresting season! We go from Lorelia asking Luke to marry her. To (maybe) the end of thier realtionship. I admit that I was ready for Luke and Loerlia to finally happen, but the way it played out i'm very upset. They could have had a better run than that. The mother-daughter girls fight was well needed no one can be that close and never have a big fight. I think they handled it very well it also made the reunion much better. Rory has also grown up very much this year if she would have never taken time off she wouldnt have realized how important Yale is. Well i dont want to go on and on but this is a must buy for any GG fan!!"
2,convinient pleasure,"As we know Gilmore girls is a TV show ,and this Item is the sixth season of that show so obviousely somebody who orders that is a fan of this show so the show is amusing and some how compulsory.And amozom service is great .The DvD was delivered much sooner than the time amozon had promised.so I call the whole package as the convinient pleasure."
5,Gilmore girls... cool as always!,This is just the best show. Lorelai's quick remarks is as always funny as h.
2,No extras at all!,"I just wanted to add my review to the others that mentioned the complete lack of extras on season 6. I love the show and enjoyed season 6; however, I was really surprised to get to the last disk and find nothing but the commercial for Gilmore Girls season 7. I can't believe that it would be difficult to come up with at least a blooper reel or a couple of interviews with actors. I admit that the dvd extras haven't been a super strong point in any of the seasons, but to not even provide one or two things is just wrong. If anyone who makes the decisions on what things to include in a dvd set is reading these, please change this on Season 7. It really makes the viewer/purchaser feel ripped off!"
2,Lack of Features and Captioning Ruined This Set,"Good Season, but the fact that the usually highly entertaining interviews and insights are missing greatly disappointed me. I have taken the time to write an e-mail to Warner Brothers DVD and complain about the lack of Closed Captioning, which is highly insulting to the Deaf Community. If you would like to do the same please follow these steps:Go to www.wbdvd.comScroll to bottom and click on ""General Help""Click ""Other FAQs""Click the link for Question 8""Click Here"" to send and e-mail complaint to Warner Brothers.I limited my complaint to the lack of closed captioning, but I think they should also hear that the lack of special features is upsetting."
4,Great Series,This is such a great series. The Gilmores have a ton of personality. They are definitely not your traditional family. Wish the series wouldn't have ended so early.
3,Disapointment over DVD's,"I have been watching the Gilmore Girls since the pilot and have always loved the Gilmore Girls. This 6th season on DVD was such a huge disappointment. No Gilmoreisims even though the episodes are full of them, no extra features, nothing. I wrote Warner Brothers and no response was given not a surprise. It's not worth the price being charged, and they lie about extra features. Write and complain to WB so they don't pull this on season 7's DVD's!"
5,A Great Season!,"This is one of the sadder seasons as it involves a rift between the two main characters Loreli and Rory (mother/ daughter), but it is about how they overcome it and also includes the engagment of Luke and Loreli. This is a must have season, but if you haven't seen previous seasons, you may want to begin with season 1 and work your way through."
1,"Repetitive, boring, easy money for Lechter and rich Dad.","My title says it all: this book is very repetitve, boring, basic and has not much beyond common sense.The repetition in the book is used to fill up pages and make an easy buck for Lechter, who is Rich Dad's patent attorney. Way to select your authors, Rich Dad."
4,Good intro,Book has slightly more meat and is a little more in depth than some of the other Rich Dad works and did what was expected gave a basic intro to the topic as well as a walk through the pitfalls of each type of OPM channel. Good intro but will require further reading to really begin to run with.
3,Hmmmm,"Interweave Knits is a well-designed and beautifully published mag with input from leaders in the field of handknitting. Its articles on technique, method, and the history of the craft are outstanding. Where this publication falls short is in the styles and patterns that are selected by the editors. I love knitting and do some almost every day, but rarely do I choose a project from Interweave. Some are quirky, some dowdy, some classic, but for some reason only a very few appeal to me. I used to subscribe, but now leaf through each new issue at the newstand before buying, and probably end up with only one out of every 3 or 4 issues each year. The same is true about Interweave's spinning and weaving publications. If you can only subscribe to one knitting mag, make it Vogue or Family Circle, 2 of the best."
3,the price is better than the microsoft one,"The control i got was not the one pictured, and my x box now says that i need the playback kit to watch movies even though the other piece is plugged in."
2,Stupid.,"I bought one of these with my xbox thinking I needed it for dvd playback. I got my xbox soft modded and it has absolutely NO use now. It will NOT let me use this remote anymore. I use the controller to control dvd playback, so if you are planning to get your xbox modded then DON'T buy this, as you will have no use for it either. Other than that, I suppose it would work great."
1,Major Disappointment,"I've never written a review for anything I've received from Amazon in the past, however this book was so disappointing I felt compelled to caution others before they plunked down their money. I was hoping for more historical, factual information pertaining to the mass itself and was very put off by this book's ""helpful"" little hints in terms of dealing with distractions during the mass, during prayer, and during other spiritual exercises. If you are looking for facts and not philosophy, this isn't the book for you. If you are considering conversion to The Faith, perhaps it would be of some interest to you, but as a Catholic, I found it to be too much preaching and not enough teaching."
5,Just what I needed,"I had been stuck in a rut about church, resenting my priest. I began searching for something to wake me up, open me up and feed me - this was the 2x4 I sometimes need across my head! I loved it, thought about it, and shared it with many others."
5,Good reference book,This is a good reference book for both new and old-a great reference for religion classes also.
4,remembering-,"Good basic book, bringing back points I had been taught, and a few new to me. Price most reasonable."
5,Allergen Filtration,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001. I installed a bag and thought it worked OK. (I did not throw the former bags, not Hoover bags, out.) The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously. My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference. After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use. I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured. While not very scientific, it convinced us. I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag, I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag. This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
5,an enchantting novel that made me weep in my own life,"This fasinating novel tells the tale of one boys year in his life. I was spellbound from page one, unable to put the book down. Todd D. Brown is a remarkable writer and his first book was a smash, the best book i have ever read, and i will continue to look forward to his reading his work and loving every minute."
3,Wheels,Grandson loves it but would be easier for little ones to use if they could turn front wheels. Easier for them to walk behind then to ride on
3,All HP 96 catridges are not the same...,"Bought the cartridge from Pavilion Electronics. It is NOT a C8767WN as listed. Instead it is an older C8767W (with a C8767WN sticker applied to the original HP packaging). I ordered the cartridge on September 4, 2009 and received a cartridge with a Feb. 2010 expiration date. Apparently this cartridge had been manufactured some time ago. Be careful not to order spares assuming that they have plenty of shelf life remaining!"
2,HP 96 Ink Cartridge,"I like the HP 96 because it can be used in many HP printers that use the HP 98, but its a better deal than the HP 98 because it contains almost twice as much ink.HP's ink cartridges provide excellent performance, but I think they are over priced"
2,most expensive liquid on the planet,"This is the most expensive liquid on the planet, if you think gas is expensive try buying a gallon of printer ink."
4,Cannon at his best,"Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderly was a master jazzman. He was the alto sax man in the wonderful Miles Davis Sextette with John Coltrane on tenor and Bill Evans on piano. In his quintets with his brother Nat, it was half ""real"" jazz and half fantastic rhythm and blues (Mercy Mercy Mercy, Why Am I Feeling So Bad) and all great music. This album is back to jazz, and it adds Yusef Lateef on tenor. This is a great addition!!! He fits in well with both the jazz and the r$b, but mostly with the jazz. Even the Joe Zawinul tune takes a great jazz turn. This is not a ""have to have"" CD, but it is a lot of fun and easy to listen to. I recommend it"
5,New Worlds Waiting,"I recently attended a reading by Jack Hirschman and was transfixed not only by his presentation, which is superb, but by his deeply felt message, poetic to a fault, a poetry that urges us all to be much better than we are. Jack is a revolutionary whose poetic imagery, as well as his politics, are born of the heart--born of knowing the full capacity of the human spirit. The U.S. is blessed for poets like him. He uses the art of poetry as the greatest artisans of language do; respectful, knowing his craft, while sharing the wisdom that just might prod us toward creating a better world. These poems span the years from 1952 to the present, so there's a lot of history here; in the process, the poetry itself mirrors back the poet's own growth,literary skill, patience with his fellow beings, and compassion. I applaud City Lights for publishing this man. He's an important writer."
4,"Betrayal and Brotherhood of Betrayal, same book","The Book is well written Christian Fiction. However, much to my dismay, I purchased Betrayal AND Brotherhood of Betrayal only to find that the Copyright dates are both 1999, both books are indentical except for the Acknowlegedgments which on Betrayal, the last paragraph differs in a heartfelt THANKS to the staff at Word Publishers and in Brotherhood of Betrayal Thanks to Multnomah Publishers (including Rod Morris, senior editor).I feel this is dishonest, misleading and I regret spending the price of two books when they are the same. I thought one was to be a sequel. Silly me..from now on I will do more research before purchasing a book or books."
1,Disappointed in VA.,"I purchased this book from Amazon and wasted a couple of bucks. Those who want to ENJOY a book on digital photography should choose ""The Digital Photography Book"" by SCOTT KELBY. He's, thorough, down to earth and humorous in his explanations of the various aspects of basic and advanced digital photography. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,One Song Really Makes It,"I guess this is when the band decided to go commercial. It works, in a way, but my problem is that none of the regular songs stand out. They are all good, just nothing special. Then comes the closing track, Warriors. Now that is getting back to what the band is all about. I could just picture them in concert, playing mostly their older, more epic songs, maybe throwing a song or two from this album in the mix to change the pace, then ending their set with Warriors. It is their epic songs that really defines the band, and it shows with Warriors. Recommended for those that don't mind their band totally shifting direction with each album."
2,Very Flimsy,This looks a lot sturdier than it actually is. The clips come apart really easily and so it makes it very inconvenient. A better spring mechanism would have been helpful.
3,Good but not Great,Glass clips work as advertised. The clip that clamps to the visor does not clamp tight enough and falls off the visor. Not a good buy.
2,This could have been much better,"Although this book boasts 4 full length exams and step-by-step coaching, it appears to be hastily put together and poorly edited. Some of the questions in the exams are woefully filled with errors, and the coaching section isn't that much better. I purchased this book along with several others to prepare for the LSAT and I must say that I'm pleased that this isn't the sole study aid I'm relying on. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for study aids, there are better ones out there."
4,"Excellent Series, Excellent Dvd's","I absolutely love this show! I can't get enough of watching it, and these dvd's are really good. For those of you that haven't seen all the episodes on cable already (because they play them all the time) you should really consider these. The only thing I could say about Vincent Donofrio's Bobby Goren is that you will either love him or absolutely hate him. He is eccentric, a know-it-all and at times annoying. He is my favorite part of the show though, because at times it is amusing to watch his antics. Kathryn Erbe is great, a perfect partner for the strange Goren. The only thing that I dislike is the few episodes that Kathryn Erbe was not in and they replaced her with some other girl like we wouldn't notice. I definitely would recommend this set for anyone that enjoys crime dramas that stay away from the court room and concentrate on the investigation, rather than the scientific aspect, like CSI."
4,keep the tomatoes in your lap,"I honestly could not keep up with the complicated terminology, however that made the play all the more interesting. What may seem a little confusing to the reader in the beginning will eventually come together near the end. Anyone who shares a rare and negative relationship with a close one may relate to this story."
3,Just doesn't hit the spot,"I just couldn't really get into it. It was very well written, but there was not enough substance! I seriously doubt that I would purchase any other book written by this author."
3,Complete but unengaging,"For completion alone, I would give this book five stars. As a total package, however, I'm not impressed. The title states that the book is ""a narrative history,"" which suggests a memoir style. However, the book reads almost as dry as a history text. One major strength is the seamless interposition of Chinese history in China over Chinese American history in America, and the logical connections between historical events in the motherland and immigration patterns to the U.S. This may be a good introduction to Chinese American history for those unfamiliar with the topic (like my ""jook sing"" husband), but for those well versed in Asian-American issues this book adds nothing to the other literature."
1,Sucks! Don't buy,"This piece of junk is just terrible I would not bought it If I had known it scratches easily and dents like heck.Please take my advice and avoid this ""thing"". I wish I could give it ZERO(0) Stars!"
4,I can't believe someone suggested that Lois Lane should have died,"(Note: I havn't seen anyone on Amazon say this but still people have elsewhere)Excuse me but Lois Lane will not die, and if she does I will quit watching the show. Clark's father passes away in the original story line and the guys doing the show knew this. In fact they waited much longer then I thought they would to kill off his character considering he dies when Clark is still in high school in the comic book. Yeah he is a good character but he was also Clark's crutch way to often. It was meant to be, it's time for Clark to wrap up his life in Smallville and become the person he is destine to become. If they go beyond season six I will be very surprised."
2,A trip to the bland side,"Thematically, this season was superior to the uncohesiveness of Season 4, but so much of the expectation is built up for this show, wrapped up in stories that never seem to jell together. For this entire season, Lex Luthor's trip to the 'dark' side has been choppily treaded and in the final episodes when his reasoning is revealed for yet another scientific experiment gone bad, once again he's doing for mankind. He's doing it for the greater good. Lex Luthor is still manipulating the world, but for beneficent reasons.Loyalty and betrayal are indeed two of the subplots of this fifth season - with neither the loyalty and nearly all of the betrayal shown by the future Man of Steel.The creators and producers have had five years to get the classic Clark Kent/Superman/Lex Luthor enmity developed. It's about time they moved from animosity and finally got down to business."
5,They just keep getting better....,"Rarely is a series able to sustain a high quality of plots, subplots and character development over time. Yet, Season 5 of Smallville does just that. The evolution of all characters, especially Lex and Clark, into what they will eventually be, is masterfully handled. What makes Smallville so compelling is that, while each episode is carefully crafted to build on the preceding episodes, each individual episode may be enjoyed in its own right by those who are as yet unfamiliar with the series. And the sound, visual effects and music are always first rate. So, assume your destiny: Buy it!"
4,Smallville Season 5,"This season, like the others before it, delivers another round of very entertaining episodes in a story line that never gets old. It also adds new characters, as well as new dimensions to the existing characters. This season ranks among my favorite of this series."
3,Not as good as earlier episodes.,We are pretty conservative at our house and I was disappointed that the series took a much more racy turn this season. I just don't like the same-sex kissing and all the skin.
4,WOW.....,This is one of the best seasons i have people who have never liked smallville fall in love w/ it....... this season leaves you wanting more.....
4,A worthy addition to the series,"The overall storyline of Season 5 is the best so far in the series. There are a few cheesy episodes that could have been done without, but for the most part, fans of Smallville will enjoy the fifth season."
1,Product rippoff!,"NO stinking sub-titles!!!!!!!! Screw - the hearing impaired!!!! I recently began collecting and watching this show. The first 4 seasons had subtitles so I didn't check before buying season 5. After receiving this ""defect"" I checked Season 6. Quess what! It has subtitles. I do not buy DVDs an Blu-rays w/o subtitles. Lession learned-Never buy w/o checking."
3,Smallville--alright but not the best show...,"What can I say about smallville, it really hasn't changed all that much from season one. The characters are still flat and lifeless, the acting is still mediocre and the characters are all still having the same issues with each other that they have for 5 years. When I am in the mood to just watch something semi entertaining and brain dead, this is what I choose. Now don't get me wrong, there are those moments where I do enjoy it (obviously, or I wouldn't continue watching it each year), but by no means is it a smart show. If you are looking for a brilliant, witty, academically savvy show to discuss over coffee, this just isn't it. If you are looking for those then I direct you to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (don't laugh, this show is brilliant and has many a college class devoted to it), and also Veronica Mars (again, an incredible piece of work). If you want something your 12 year old finds entertaining then pick Smallville. It is cheesy but fun."
5,Glued to the screen,Smallville season 5 is addictive. It has such a great cast and the episodes have back to back excitement. This has to be the most nail biting season. I really enjoyed this season and was disappointed when it had to finish. I can't wait to watch the next season. I recommend this to all ages and anyone that loves adventure.
3,subtitles,its good to have subtitles as many as they can. spanish and french not enough as they could have put english for hearing impired.
5,I am a BIG Yankees Fan,"I am a Yankees fan. My late father was a ""newyorican"" and a rabid fan od the ""bronx bombers"". I collect yankees memorabilia."
4,Almost Great,"Pros:1. Solid, lightweight case.2. Very easy to build with lots of room.3. Quality construction.4. Looks good.Cons:1. When you shut the front door the intake airflow is restricted. It looks like there is a vent but it does not go all the way through the door. I bought a SilverStone 110 CFM fan for the front that runs at full speed all the time. I can open the fron door and watch the MB temp drop.2. Not completely sold on the Honeycomb hole on the side. I think directed airflow is more efficient.3. Proprietary screws for the hard drive trays. Don't lose them!Conclusion:If air cooling is not your biggest concern, this is a good all around case. If you have very hot running components, and dont want to use liquid cooling, you might look elsewhere. So far my Thermaltake Mozart Tx is the ultimate case for air cooling (10 X 120 MM Fans)The only problem is that it is HUGE."
1,This is a drive belt not agitator belt.,This belt is a wide drive belt. Not a agitator belt as described. If I had read a little more closely I would have seen that these were not in manufacture's packaging. I have a Hoover windtunnel and needed the thin belt used to run the agitator bar. This is not it. I'm only out 3 bucks so not an expensive lesson to double check my numbers and to not believe these are windtunnel agitator belts as advertised.
2,Break very quickly,"Belt breaks very quickly, actually after installing a belt I can clean carpet only one or two times. It is just junk."
4,Vacuum belts,Haven't had to replace the belts on our Hoover vacuum yet as we only recently purchased it. If the need arises to change the belts I will update this review with useful information.
1,agitator belts,These belts do not fit my vac even though they are stated to do so. It was a waste of my money to get these belts. I do have a Hoover Windtunnel. but these belts are too small to fit my agitator.
1,over priced,you seem to be way over priced on your items. if this gets to be a problem i will have to take my business elsewhere.
1,Not in retail packaging,Very different from advertised pckaged belts please refer to other reviews found the same problem of belt lacking normal elasticity.
1,What a shame,"Raving Rabbids is further proof of what seems to be a new trend - the disappearance of the linear style ""adventure"" play games. RR is geared toward the pre-school set and if you are looking for anything more difficult or challenging....pass it up. I picked up and played the entire game in an afternoon. Ubisoft should be highly ashamed of the pricetag. It is not commensurate with the lack of time and effort it obviously took to produce this game. Here's hoping they go back to the drawing board and make an attempt to develop something worthy of the Rayman name."
2,Poor story-line,"Did I miss something while reading this book? Nothing happens!! It's about two girls, one of them falls in love with a guy only he doesn't really love her back. And the other girl ends up with a boyfriend. That's it. Oh, and time goes by. Very ""fly on the wall""-ish, a bit disappointing."
1,rules of the road review,"I thought this book was trash I did not like it and I wish I never bought it. it was not only a waste of my time, but also a waste of my money."
1,I never received this order,This order was put in through amazon through someone else. I never received this order and I paid for it. Amazon gave me a $7.99 credit and I ordered the book through them. Thank you Amazon.
4,Funny,"This is a very funny but yet a serious subject. I really liked the book because it talks about an average teenage girls every day problems.Her apperance, divorced parents,and a sister are a few of the problems she has in this book.It has a good message about everybody is not perfect in this world. Hope you like this book."
5,What rules is she following?,"Rules of the Road was an excellent and witty portrayal of teenage girl. I found Jenna's character very easy to identify to, being a teenager myself.Although she may not be the most good looking or charming 16 yr old, she definitely knows how to sell shoes! When the owner of the shoe store she works for hires her to be her personal driver... Jenna is in for the journey of her lifetime. She learns a lot about herself, as well as others. In the end, she is a true hero.I think any teenager would enjoy this book! Definitely pick it up... you won't be sorry!"
1,This book is for girls!!,"After reading Rules of the Road,I came to a few conclusions. One is that its story line (about a girl whose responsibilities are choking her, life ect) is very original but not very interesting. However, I thought the characters were true to life and reminded me of people I know. All in All, this book really did not grab my attention and i would not suggest it to other people, but if you like to read about overcoming the every day hardships of life then go for it."
2,Two stars for having lots of nice photos,"The title of this book is misleading--it is NOT comprehensive in any way, it covers only the high-performance Camaros (RS, SS, Z28, Yenko, COPO, etc.), with the information being very basic in scope. The many detailed color photos are the only reason to buy this book.Although I would consider it an easy read, sometimes it's tough to accept all of the errors. Like the other reviewers here, I'm really convinced that MBI forgot the entire editing process with this one. The author probably knows the subject matter, but it hardly shows with all of the mistakes, misinformation and poor grammar.For a few bucks more, I would highly recommend ""Camaro"" [ISBN: 0760319324] by Anthony (Tony) Young. It's definitely the best Camaro book I've found!"
2,why,"This product was in great condition, but it wouldn't play games right away, i took from 5 to 10 minutes to start the game. No matter what, it usually says ""disc read error"" and that happens on brand new games."
1,PS2 SUCKS!!,"PS2 Sucks, it has bad graphics, games, controller, dvd player, and you need a memory card!! and there are only 2 controller holes, when Gamecube and Xbox have four. Gamecube comes 2nd, because there is no online sytem, need memory card, ok controllers, and sort of bad graphics. Im leaving the best for the last! Xbox rocks get an xbox and you will be happy!! You dont need memory card, good controllers, online service, games, dvd player an etc. SO go and order an xbox!!"
2,[hendhelp gaming system],The sony company is making the psp a hendhelp gaming system with EVERYTHING the PS2 has! OMG its the same as ps2 just smaller and stole the model of game boy advance! Dont get it! LOW battery life! The Ds looks like a Gameboy SP with a double screen is better! ITS NEW! it has touch screens great graphics and voice command it think! Its gonna own the PSp go DS! Oh yeah PS3 If you look at gamespot ITS THE SAME AS THE PS2 JUST SMALLER AND HAS A NEW LOOK! Wait its a new model of the ps2 for 150 dollars CRAP! i heard the PS3 has Worse grphics than the XBOX! omg xbox is older but has better graphics!!!!!
4,Greatest system on EARTH!,"Sure your fancy xbox has better graphics but its made by the biggest nerd in the worlds company, so DUH! PS2 has way funner games and the controllers are way easier to use than those fat ass xbox controllers. You dont have to pay for the online(unlike xbox) so you can play without charge. you can use the DVD player without buying a remote, but it makes it easier ifyou do. Its way smaller and doesnt take up space like fat ass xbox (ever noticed how everything about xbox is fat? Hmm wonder why!) any way PS2 is way better than GC and Xbx so get this instead!"
4,"Great system, but still over rated.","I've never believed that this is the best system, I think it's all preference. Lately alot of people have been complaining about their systems breaking down for no reason, myself being one of those. It was the same way with the PSX, you can play for about a year and then you gotta buy a new system. I don't see why everyone thinks it's the best. You can play DVD's right out of the box, but who doesn't have a (better quality) DVD player these days. They have more games, but for every good game there are about 5 that suck. Most of the good games that you can get on PS2 are also on other systems, usually with better graphics for XBOX. Not to mention that the Xbox came with an internal 10 gig harddrive. Xbox it probably a better buy at this point. If you don't like old mammouth controllers they have the S-Controller now."
4,Solid system,"The Sony Playstation 2 is one of the best systems out there, It has what I like to call the total package. Great games and availability to do just about any and everything that any other system can do. It can play dvds, cds, games and it is ready to play all of these right of the box. Plus it has the best line up of games around. They have the Grand Theft Auto series, Resident Evil, Jak and Daxter, EA sports games, Devil May Cry, and plenty of other games. And one thing you can be sure of if you buy a ps2 is that you'll be getting any game out here (unless it's been made specifically for one of the other systems.) Usaully game makers make games for the ps2 because its such a popular system. There's a reason why it is a popular system.Only 4 stars because they continue to sell there games to Microsoft and they also have the worst technologhy of the 3 next gen systems."
1,Boo!,"This thing sucks. It was wonderful at first, but now it can't play games for more than 5 minutes without freezing or making weird noises. I'm going to buy an Xbox and throw this thing out my window. The only use I get out of it is the DVD player. I HIGHLY discourage the purchase of this machine."
2,Xbox ROX!!,"I know... This probably shouldn't be on the PS2 review, but I have to say, Xbox is much better. It has GREAT games (My personal favorite is Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom) and GREAT graphics. I Encourage you NOT to buy the PS2 and go for the Xbox."
1,Does anyone have the original PlayStation 2 for sale???,"Unfortunately there isn't a zero star rating. Otherwise I'd have given this rating a zero!Thinking that I'd finally tracked down an original PS2, I went ahead and purchased this. To my horror (and relief, now that I think about it) my money was returned along with a notification stating that the wrong product had been shipped. So...thanks for nothing is what I'm basically saying.If anyone has an original big body PS2 for sale, please let me know!!!Thanks!"
5,My mom loves this,I don't know what she wanted a PS2 but she says it came brand new and she loves it!!! She also says it workes great! Thank you very much we will order from you again
5,Excellent system,"I received this gaming system as a Christmas present 2-3 years ago, and never once have I regretted getting it.Boasting a wide variety of games, including some precious exclusive big winners like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy X,X-2 and XII, and a couple Metal Gear Solid titles and more that I can't remember, it's my favorite over GameCube anyday.Graphics are excellent, can't say I notice anything greater on GC (I don't have or know anyone with an Xbox, so. . .)It has one of the best controllers around, I think, and it's a nice, sleek looking machine that has never once given me problems. Runs fairly quiet, and can usually handle quite a lot of whatever programmers throw at it-(If it couldn't, it'd be useless)-Hard to dust, I notice, but that's a minor quibble when compared to all the pros of this awesome gaming console."
1,ugh..,"ps2 SUX!it screws up so easily! oh yea it came with a 2 year warranty but it broke down right after 2 years, as if sony was expecting it.and jeez ps2 games suk! oh yea, they can boast good graphics, but even old games like mario could beat it in gameplay.get a gamecube, gba, xbox, or just resort to pc games. but wutever u do, DO NOT buy a ps2!! waste of $$$!and ""oh"" some ppl say, ""it can also play dvds and cds!"" WHO GIVES A CR@P! dont u think most ppl alhave HAVE dvd players and cd players(etc.)?!?!my gosh im going to wait for PS3 and wait a while to see if it still breaks down like this dump."
2,Its ok,"I mean the graphics arent good at all. Gameplay isnt very good either. its just the advertisements that make people want to buy it and waste money for something they play once are twice than they get bored of it. Your better off with a gamecube or an xbox. all though the gmaeplay isnt very well on xbox, its better than ps2's and better graphics. If you want the best gameplay you can find get a SEGA DREAMCAST for your first choice, than a nintendo gamecube."
3,Good product,"The PS2 I ordered works great, but the controller that came with it didn't work. But, I only needed the PS2 so I liked it."
1,Awfule,We actually never received our package and the company refused to contact us back. Amazon had to give us our money back. Do not order from them!
1,PS2 VS GAMECUBE THE WINNER IS...,XBOX is the best system however the PS2 and Gamecube Is hard to find out who is winner and i will tell you the answerGamecube-Best games made from the good Company NINTENDO PLays GBA games Better Graphics than PS2 4 Controller ports VERY portible and Loads really fast.Bads from Gamecube-has bad internet connection cant play dvd really small Disks small ControllerPS2- ALOT of games plays PS games has eyetoy plays dvd best controller has internetBad things of PS2- Horrible graphics OVERHEATS fast really expensive breaks easy Problems of reading disks.OVERALL- The GAMECUBE is better with Quality but PS2 has internet get Gamecube Cheaper better graphics does not overheat and is portable
1,PS2 CAN NOT COMPARE TO XBOX AT ALL,ps2 sucks! if you played gta vice city on ps2 u always waited forever for it to load. Xbox it loads rite in front of your face a million times faster. the graphics on xbox are also a million times better. You cant even compare a PS2 to a gamecube. Gamecube has even got better graphics on its first games. It use to be that the only reason to get a ps2 was for GTA but now xbox has it. Now there is no reason at all to have a ps2.PS2 SUCKS
1,PS2=Piece of Junk!!,"Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, ""Disc Read Error""? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a ""real"" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right? As for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation 1 was better, why don't YOU get a life. People have their own preferences in what they like."
1,Have a nice Christmas Lunch HAHAHAHAHA,"Hard to believe people still play Play station isn`t it ? perhaps it shows us just how influential the social marginal is, playing a play station is like driving an old car while you paid for a new one the year is 2003 time to evolve people to X BOX yes it blows PS2 away. If you just got the family a play station 2 for Christmas have a nice Christmas lunch hahahaha ."
3,Never Will Be God,I own every gaming station there is and out of them all the PS2 has the most games but the rest that aren't on any other consoles usually just (...). The graphics are the worse (...)and the loading times are longer then life itself. (...)
4,OH MY GOSH HOW DO THEY DO IT!!!,"This is the best thing ever. I got it for Christmas 2 years ago and yikes!!! Did this blow me away. The games are awesome, and so is the whole thing. The thing that really blows me away is the awesome DVD. SO great. But, let me just tell you this (this dosn't have to do with the program just the brand.) It is now Febuary of 2004, and, yet I truly say this little box can control all, I have heard that they are coming out with Playstation 3. Oh My Gosh. I really don't know a date, but the prices of these things are going down, (just like the original PlayStations did.) and sad to say, the games will turn into PS3 games and sooner or later PS2s will be gone. If you dont care about this little problem, then buy the thing. Otherwise, your just going to have wait."
4,Generations of creativity,"I have regularly had the pleasure of hearing Janet Riehl read her poems, and of visiting her art installations in various outdoor settings.What impresses me about ""Sightlines"" is the sort of generational legacy it conveys. Janet's family is very creative and their personalities come through in the respective sections that are devoted to them.These poems are personal and heartfelt and are enhanced by Janet's choice of photography. Altogether, this is a beautiful and moving book. A fitting tribute to a very special family!"
4,Awesome,"This is a really cool book. Mr.Frank (who happens to be my sixth grade teacher) has a fun sense of humor, and everyone should buy this book. Also check out his other books Erin's Voyage and Tomb of the Boy King."
5,Fantastic product great customer service. . .,"Because I used Cygo Lite products before, when it was time to add another light they were my first choice. I changed models and I did have a question or two about computability with other batteries systems by the same manufacturer. A quick call to customer service gave me competent, courteous help and the answers to my questions. The light itself exceeds my expectations! Simple design with a large thumb button makes operating the light simple even with gloves on. The helmet mounting bracket is easy to use and removes quickly if you prefer to finish the day's ride with out the light attached. Burn time on a battery charge is as advertised. Great product - great service."
1,sensor's didn't work,Bought two... Neither of the motion sensors work and one of them won't hold a charge... I'm not asking for much just to work as described... Don't recommend and wouldn't buy again...On a side note the chord is too short for a larger shed...
5,"BETTER than original Law&Order, criminal intent or trial by jury","SVU is the best investigative show. Certain episodes i can actually relate to them. And i haven't been able to deal with what i went thru, but watching those particular episodes by accident, where u never know what its storyline was about. I was facing it right there n then. It was hard, painful, and scary... But watching those episodes end nicely where the bad guys were punished, it sort of become A Closure for me, and made me move on with my life much much better. I woke up the next day, feeling much much better about being me. The demons went away. Thank You SVU.... Now i just can't wait for all their tv episodes to be on dvd, and hopefully SVU will go on and on, as long as the original Law&Order does!"
5,Excellent for beginners and as a resource guide,This is a very well written guide to starting and caring for your Bonsai. Once I get this mastered I would like to get the Master School Books.
4,Good Book,"it is a good book. It tells the fundamentals and good ways of hitting the ball. And being a playerthat used to not hit too well, I am saying this is the book to get if you are looking to hit better."
1,Doesn't work,I tried a whole tube on several fabrics and different stains. It didn't work on any of them. Total waste of money. Makes me wonder if people are being paid to write positive reviews. Bottom line: doesn't work. Waste of money.
5,Embarassed to say...,I read this book when I was a kid and I still consider it the best book I ever read. Then again everything was better when you were a kid... but still.
5,The PERFECT Book,"I think that this is the greatest book to have ever been written. I think that this book should be required reading in every classroom in the nation. In point of fact, I think that this book is quite possibly, the ""perfect"" book by any account of perfection.Highly recommended!!Sincerely, Kim Oglethorpe (linguistic pathologist extraordinaire)"
3,"Small, Cute but too ""HOT""","I have got this usb hub for few months. Yes, it's small and looks cool, and after plug it into my dell 700m, it works well. Disagree with other reviewers, I have plugged 3 external hard drives in that hub and they are working very well even after weeks of continuous high speed data flowing. Yeah, I know that I am such a computer nerd...But, which make me very upset is the temperature, after only several minutes, it will become very very hot in the far side. I even worry if it will be burned.This hub dosen't come with adapter, but there is a hole for the adapter, so maybe you can buy an adapter to provide power for it.The cord is too short, but if you have an extension cable, that's fine."
1,Iogear hub & service unreliable,"I bought an Iogear GUH274 4-port USB Hub on Amazon and a year later, almost to the day, the ports started failing one by one. Their 3-year warranty requires me to send them the bad device for a replacement, which means I have to buy another hub to be able to function in the meantime, which policy they apologized for but didn't correct. I had a whole printer fail that was replaced on the spot by Epson without them even wanting the old one back. I would never buy an Iogear USB hub again."
1,Can corrupt data,"I would recommend against buying this device. Just got mine in the mail today, plugged my keyboard in through it, and found the keyboard unusable due to garbage data getting output to the terminal. Had a similar experience when running my mouse through it (random movement, click detection, etc)."
2,Worked Well Then Died,"I bought this hub 15 months ago. It worked pretty much flawlessly until last week. I typically have an external HD, keyboard, printer and mouse connected to it and my computer cannot detect any of the devices anymore."
5,Heart-Greatest Hits 1985-1995,This is one of the best greatest hits albums of all times. I listen to it over and over again and love it. Definitely worth buying.Everyone will recognize every song on this album.
5,Great sturdy stand with easy setup,"First of all, Amazon not clear about this, but the box includes 2 speaker stands. I assembled each in about 5 minutes. The way this adjusts is that you can put up to three spacers on the top and up to three spacers on the bottom. The spacers are completely hidden within the solid plastic sleeve you see on the picture. The sleeves themselves are fixed size and the metal pole slides into or out of it depending on how many spacers you place. Speaker wire is threaded through inside of the metal poles and are completely out of view. You can also fill the poles with sand although for most people it won't be necessary."
3,This is NOT a broom...ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM!!!,"I bought this little item because I thought it would be a good traveling companion for my witch of a wife. Boy was I surprised when I found it the Quik-Broom was not only poorly spelled, but incorrectly named. Please be advised: this is not a broom. It is a very skinny vacuum cleaner. It's an interesting item nevertheless as it doesn't take vacuum bags, but instead collects dirt in a little cup you have to turn over and shake out (this is annoying). On the plus side, it is small and fairly powerful. However, when I buy something called a broom I expect a broom and not a vacuum. I wouldn't want to order a beer at the bar and get a glass of milk. Would you?"
1,Do Not purchase this vacuum.,"I bought this a year ago and it just died on me. Which is actually good news, because I was starting to get tired of attaching the hose to the back of this little monster, and crawling around on my hands and knees to clean (because you can't stand and use the hose attachment). I also won't be missing the high-pitched whine that the motor made, giving me hours of headaches."
3,Disappointed,"I have read ""Marine Sniper"" and wanted another book about Carlos Hathcock. I did not think that a 295 page book was worth $45.00 so decided against buying it. My daughter found that I wanted ""White Feather"" and bought it for me for my birthday. I told her that she shouldn't have and now really mean it after reading the book. There was too much commentary on the politics of the Vietnam war, too many pages dipicting documents that I could not read on my Kindle, and far to many spelling errors for a book costing $45.00. I consider Carlos Hathcock a true Vietnam hero and was looking forward to reading more about him. ""White Feather"" was a disappoinment."
5,"Carlos Hathcock ""Whitefeather""","My son-in-law has been interested in this book since a friend recommended he read it. I ordered for a Christmas present, the shipping was fast & my son-in-law was glad to receive it! The whole family plans to read the book. Thanks."
2,Eh...,"Cabinet is nice. Not happy with the no spill design. Water collects on the sink. It's a pain. ""/There is a cut-out in the marble for bar soap which I am not thrilled with."
5,This toy is great!,"We just bought the geomag glow in the dark set for our son's 4th birthday. He has been playing with Legos quite a bit all spring and summer so I thought this would interest him. He took to them immediately. Tonight we were going to get ice cream and he told us ""in a minute. I want to do this first."" A toy that beats out ice cream. Now THAT'S amazing!"
4,Wonderful,My son's really enjoy this product...... My youngest one really gets into it. I myself also enjoys it. Very educational. I'm a teacher aide at my place of employment. It will come in handy when we get to the chapter on Magnetic.... I rate the as a A++++++++++++++++++
3,"Tiny magnets, very powerful.","I was surprised by how small (seriously dinky) these magnets were when I received them, but they are VERY powerful magnets. I love sushi and I love these magnets, but they were definitely not ""life-size."""
5,Wow. Be prepared to buy season four.,"Season Three of OTH is probably the most exciting season of the entire series up to date. There are not a lot of throw away episodes and the story moves along quickly. Without giving away too much, the shooting that takes place changes the dynamics of the series forever. I would recommend buying season four with this, or buying the entire series in a bundle pack, because there is no way you would be able to watch this season without craving for more. Great music and so much drama."
3,"Going, going, gone?","AW is a great tool, albeit an aging one. Adobe refuses to discuss any plans for continued development of this product, so keep that in mind before you spend $2k on a product that very well may be shelved by its developer (the last major release was in 2004). I have used AW for years and love it, but I'm increasingly seeing clients and fellow developers moving on to other tools due to a lack of development and uncertainty as to its future. It's a great product, but I would do some homework before purchasing it."
3,"just ""okay""","i find that the serrations arent very sharp so you have to push pretty hard into the grapefruit. in doing this you hurt your finger because the sides of the spoon are kind of sharp (i have uploaded a picture of the depression on my finger). they should be more rounded and a bit thicker so they are more comfortable in the hand. but i guess for the price, they are okay"
4,Grapefruit spoon,"These spoons work really well especially when used with the ""HIC Harold Imports Squirt-Free Grapefruit Knife"". The combination really does a great job of getting all the fruit and none of bitter out of your halved grapefruit."
5,Beautiful Grapefruit Spoons,"These aren't terribly expensive so keep your expectations reasonable but that being said, I was impressed. I used these spoons for the grapefruit course of our Christmas dinner (a favorite family tradition) and they looked lovely next to the formal decor. Mine were all of very good quality and I was very pleased with them."
1,quality control anyone ?,The quality of the spoons is horrible. They really feel like those you get at 4/1$ at the dollar store. The edges are randomly serrated and they feel like they are going to bend when trying to tear some grapefruit fibers. They are NOT thick at all.returned mine.
5,$19.99 for old school comic book lovers,There's never enough Batman. The interviews are great. It's really nice to get to write this review about the people who told the stories right and loved what they were doing and made stories that I loved.
4,As far one of the best animated,"One of the best animated series, 4 DVDs the first seasson and 2 DVDs the second. Both in digipack, hours of fun. The first serie only have spanish subtitles, the second only in english and portuguese."
2,What the H happen with the spanish audio and subtitles?,"I'm really shocked about the decision of Warner Bros. of eliminate the spanish subtitles (and audio) of the line of animation DVDs box-sets based on the DC Comics characters and replace them with portuguese. What the hell are they thinking about? It's a complete mistery to me. I hope this mistake will be corrected in a future edition of the same material. The same for the Teen Titans and The Batman Season 3.About the animation, it's a superb way to finish the DC Animated Universe. It's a pleasure to see the Darkseid/Apokolips storyline (than began in Superman The Animated Series) coming to and end.It's a 5 stars animation. Sadly, the lame decision of banned the spanish subtitles and audio deserve a score of -1 starsAt the end, 2-stars for this edition."
4,Almost perfect,The music is beautiful and very impressive.The lack of a consequent booklet is therefore even more damageable.This is why the fifth star falls down.
4,great for wimps like me,"I had always wanted to do some yoga...but good grief - I would hurt something if I tried a class.I have the book ""Yoga for Wimps"" - but I found it hard to read and position at the same time.It took me about 3 months to get all the way through the DVD....and I still must use a chair for the warrior poses. But I am amazed at myself. Arms and legs are stronger. Better flexibility.This is a good choice. Just do not expect to do the entire DVD at first. Just do what you can do...it will get better."
1,Didn't work,"I moved into a building that had roaches but was not told about this problem beforehand. I bought these prior to my apartment being sprayed for the third time. I don't know if my building has a special strain of finicky and pesticide resistant roaches. But nothing seems to work. This product was no exception. I didn't catch a single roach. I did catch a gnat however. I would recommend this product if you have a gnat problem.The best luck I have had is with simple peanut butter, sugar, and baking soda combined."
1,Doesn't work - bugs walk right over it and don't get stuck!,The trap does not work. It seems to attract bugs but they just walk over it and keep on going...they don not get stuck.
1,This time all traps came with huge defect,"This is not the first time I order these traps from Amazon. It was a good product and worked really well. This last time all traps have defects, glue which was supposed to be inside these traps was spread all over them the way that I couldn't separate them and got the sticky glue over myself and sissors . I ordered 3 packages and all 3 came with the same problem. I can not use them . Amazon replaced the defected item in two days for free and did not ask to return the old one."
3,Bug trap,"I'm not sure if it works. We have had a problem with scorpions. I have not seen scorpions in the trap, but some kmoving slowly close to them."
5,Succeeds Where Others Have Failed,"I bought two Flash 5 books to get better acquainted with the Flash 5 software. I've owned the software for about 8 months now and really haven't touched really touched it. This is mainly due to my inability to follow tutorials that leave gaps, or are vague. With ""Flash 5 Bible"" I was able to not only follow the tutorials, but also understand and anticipate the design process better. While the book isn't revolutionary compared to others on the market, I found the author support, the text, and the usefulness of the book to be well above most books out there. So, if you are on the fence, so to speak, about getting this book. Get it; you won't be disappointed."
2,"Buy it used ""Beginners Only""",If you using flash for the 1st time this book is good for you. It will give you all that you need to understand flash 5. The book speaks for it self. Is like going to your local library and pickin' up all the refrence that you need to build a dynamic web site. Like the title says for beginners only...
1,Don't waste time and money,I feel like I am reading a theory book with unclear example. I wasted my money for this book.
3,Anemic accompanying Web site,"One of the first reviews on this book stated that the accompanying Web site was still not finished on 2-18-01. Well, it's 8-12-01 and it's still as anemic as ever. http://www.flash5bible.com/"
1,"Bad Editing, Alot of Errors",This books is fraught with errors that will drive you crazy if you're trying to learn Flash for the first time. It's a great example of what happens when a book needs to get to press before it's been thoroughly edited. I'm actually on Amazon.com to get another Flash 5 tutorial book to replace this monument to bad editing. In a word... don't waste your money. :)
2,Remote,"Remote does not work for Directv as there is no guide button; therefore, you cannot review upcoming shows. For just TV, it would be OK."
2,It may work on older tv's,"Don't buy this if you have an hdtv. This controller is so old the only controls that it could work on my tv are channel and volume. I suppose if you have an older tube tv it would do the job, but it is not worth trying to save a dollar buying this old piece of junk rather than a different controller on Amazon. One that was manufactured more recently than 2004."
4,"Simple remote, but cheaper at Walmart",I bought this because we needed one at the time and I needed to spend $5 more to qualify for free supersaver shipping. It does all I need it to do and it seems to support a lot of devices.
1,Doesn't work!,"I ordered this and tried it on at least ten TV sets. It didn't work on any of them. Most misleading product I ever purchased. Not ""universal"" at all."
1,"Great product, right up to the point at which it fell apart...","Heavy duty construction. Large orange grips fit your hands well and are easy to connect. However, I had the same problem as all of the others; male end blew off under normal household water pressure rendering the hose useless. I'll install a new male connector, so that i don't have to throw it away but that kind of defeats the point of those big orange ergonomic ends."
1,Orange end,Product lasted about a month before the orange end popped off. I heated it up and put it back on but it continues to come off. I didn't keep my receipt and have not found any solution for keeping an other wide fine 5/8 garden hose in service.
5,Wonderful Acoustic Music!,"What a fantastic album! I recently saw Chris Hillman in concert, and enjoyed him so much I decided to seek out his music. I got a couple solo albums, which I love, but this album holds a special place in my heart. Each song is memorable and well done, both instrumentally and vocally. I love the harmonies of the Rices, Hillman and Pedersen. From ""Hard Times"" to ""Only Passing Through"", each song is a gem.I can't recommend this CD enough! If possible, I would give it ten stars!"
5,Inspiring,"If you haven't read this book, you are missing out. An amazing story of a courageous family, it will put your entire life into perspective. They say God doesn't give us more than we can handle but he came close to the edge with the Glaser family. Tp turn tragedy into such a passion to change the way the World looks at pediatric AIDS was an amazing feat for Elizabeth Glaser but she triumphed and used her short tragic life to make a difference. What an amazing woman."
2,"Why didn't I get ""Organizing Plain and Simple""?","Deneice could have cut the size of this book in half, but she likes to give twenty examples for each scenario. Yes, I understood the running list idea. The first example clarified it further. The sixteenth, however is boring.Most of her writing is directed toward families with children, so DINKS and singles can skip this book. I wish I would have. Why didn't I buy ""Organizing Plain and Simple""? Also, either she has a 1950s mentality or this book hasn't been updated since it was published in 1952, er I mean 1982. Ever heard of a computer, Deniece?And one more thing ... saving up to buy a trash can for a son's room? Look, if you can't afford to buy a trash can for little Timmy's room, you have failed miserably as a person and should not even have children."
1,Mad in America,"It reads like a PHD thesis, rather than a non-fiction book for the general public. Beware it is tough reading, and not very enlightening beyond the introduction. Although it was known going in that it was not a pleasant subject, it does not capture the audience very well, as it is very redundant in its comments throughout the book. Not recommended!"
5,"/this movie should have 1,000 STARS","I have heard of Dr. Burzynski but had no idea how truly great he is. The movie -in my opinion - only touches the surface of a horrible situation in this country. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OUR HEALTH. The FDA and EPA allow horrible chemicals in our food (Monsanto), air and water all for the kickbacks they receive. And the average citizen accepts it. I became active when I found out that Propelyene Glycol (Anti freeze)was in baby wipes and baby products Finally after 20 years of signing protests they are removing it. It is time for more info in the media to make all aware and help us help ourselves. We deserve and have the right to good health.Janice M"
3,burzynski the movie,This guy ought to get a nobel peace prize for his super-human acts of saving lives under duress from so many fronts. Thank God Amazon had the guts to make this important movie available to the public.
1,Bad ink,I bought two cartridges of the HP 97 and neither one worked correctly. It either had dried ink or not filled correctly or some other problem. I took them to a store for a recycle credit and bought their ink. Theirs worked.
5,Great Product,"This product arrived quickly and in good shape. It was a while before I plugged it in (I don't use this printer often), but worked like a charm the first time for my son's class project."
4,Works great.,"Works great, no problems, what can you say its a cartridge, by HP . Its shiny and doesnt suck. Why is there a 20 word minimum for a cartidge review? It works or it doesnt. This one did."
3,Oldies on TV,"This DVD has the opening programs of the TV shows mentioned on it's cover. If you love these old shows, you'll love these opening editions. I didn't watch these shows very much when I was a kid, so, my opinion is based more on the present than the past. I found the acting and scripts to be mediocre. I probably would not have bought this if I had known how mediocre they were. But, hey, like I say, if you're a fan of these specific shows, you'll probably like this DVD. The one benefit is that it does have just one show from each TV program. You don't have to buy a whole series to discover whether you still like these shows from your childhood."
1,POS,Don't buy it. I am warning you. Broke off at the hilt the second time I used it. The steel is really brittle.
1,Black hair turned grey,This product is good only when ALL YOUR HAIR IS GREY. In my case I had one third grey and after using it I noticed the grey hair increasing rapidly until it covered almost all my head.I wouldn't recommend it for use by those whose hair is NOT ALL GREY.
2,"Okay book, if you like multiple pics of the same tractor","CASE Tractors enthusiast color series by Andrew Morland and Nick Baldwin is not something I like. There are many pictures of the same model of tractor in different positions, with repetitive descriptions and not very informative text. If you like just pictures it is OK."
5,Becnels best work to date...,Axton de la mensa is the alpha male fromMy dreams finally come to life in this novel... FINALLY!!! He is dark brooding sensuous powerful and has immense sexual prowess ... Yet he has this soft side to him too.. he begins to harbour feelings for his wife linnea despite never setting his mind to this eventuality..This book is a breath of fresh air.. i find myself eagerly going back to this book and seeking out my favourite chapters and passages.. i have immense respect for the character peter too thats axtons younger brother.. How he is able to reign in his brother and make him See fault with his actions is refreshing to read... And that axton is not portrayed as a domineering uncouth violent lord of the castle is refreshing to read too..
1,Not Happy With this Purchase,I didn't really care for this DVD--It's way to fast for a beginner..I thought the instructor was trying to be to cute...I gave this out to seven others to try and none of us liked it..
1,Very melodramatic and veracity questioned,"I read this book years ago and found it to be highly melodramatic---Chiniquy was a bad Bertha Kalich---and theologically questionable. Historically speaking, Chiniquy was defrocked by the Roman Church for gross sexual misconduct. Most people don't know that or care enought o investigate. This book could be compared to 'The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk' and other 19th century yarns about tunnels leading from the rectory to the convent. What a hoot! But, it soothes the anti-catholic spirit, doesn't it?"
3,Illustrations difficult to view in Kindle version,"Convenient to have Kindle version but illustrations are difficult to view, one of the main illustrations has to be viewed sideways. Would recommend Kindle version anyway though."
1,unhappy,I was not impressed with the story line and and the acting . I was board during watching the whole thing. I felt the whole day was a waste. The promises of the the editoral review was not met.
2,"Lexx in glourious ""MONO"" sound","Just compared my VHS versions of the first four Lexx movies to the Echo Bridge DVD release of season 1. The VHS versions are in stereo, the DVD's are in mono sound with no option of stereo. Come on Echo Bridge, is it too much to ask to have the original 2.0 stereo soundtrack? Makes one wonder if the same thing was done with the seasons 2-4 DVD boxset rereleases. Video quality is very good, so what happened?"
1,Clever idea but awful,Spoof or not this is not good science fiction.......just dumb. The idea may have been good but the script must have been written by twelve year old boys with a lingerie magazine.
3,LEXX- You either like it or you don't,"I am a big Sci-Fi fan. I routinely purchase ""Made for TV"" or ""Made for Cable"" series, so I had read and heard that LEXX was another well-accepted ""classic"". It ran for four years, so obviously it had a following. I found that LEXX is kind of a cross between ""Farscape"" and the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" genre. I guess you either like it or you don't. I really enjoyed ""Farscape""..... and especially enjoyed ""Firefly""..... but LEXX not so much. ""Star Trek""....."" Battlestar Galactica"".... both very elegant and engaging series. LEXX is much more ""blue collar"". Some guts and gore mixed with a little female sensuality at times and very bizarre humor. When they qualify it as ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""..... yeah, I'd say that is fairly accurate. Just don't expect ""elegance"" in this series."
4,Good salt sub,Tastes just like salt Only negative is that it takes longer to desolve in boilling water Great diet low salt substitute
5,I work at a toy store...,"and we have a floor sample of the 184 set. I cannot tell you how many times I have felt like yelling ""I quit"" just so I can sit down with it and really play with it. I have found myself mindlessly putting together simple structures and then ten minutes later I start building a replica of Epcot. What is really great is the glow in the dark set. I made the big dipper and orion. The strength of the magnets allow you to actually wear jewelry made out of them. My coworkers and I are always making ourselves necklaces and tiaras to wear. They are just so addictive...I love them."
5,OZ the complete 6th season,Excellent season.. just as expected from the 5 previous seasons.. great charachters etc etc..
3,Not as good as the previous ones.,"The last season of the seriess ""OZ"", was not as edgy as the previous ones. The nudity scenes were cut by half and the indivudual dramas are quite repeated."
3,A disappointing climax,"I was enjoying this series so much that I ended up buying the whole six series. However I was very disappointed in the way it was all wound up in number six. It was like they ran out of ideas and didn't know how to finish. I can't really tell you why without spoiling it for you but to just stop would have been better than the way they ended it. It was a waste of a good cast and a previously good script. Of course there were some characters who fully deserved to end up the way they did but the ending was far too ""neat"". The rest of the series I would rate at 5 stars."
3,A great series until the end,"I really enjoyed the multiple seasons of OZ. The character development and twists and turns kept me interested up until the end. While there was a lot of violence, it seemed to be for a point, given that the series does take place in a very violent prison. My only issue with the series is that the ending (i.e. last few episodes) seems to completely lose it."
2,Weak and diluted scent,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this seems to be a very weak and diluted version of a classic perfume. The scent is very faint and has no staying power. I'm sure I would love this perfume if it were available in a more concentrated, ""eau de parfum"" version, but this version is a rip-off. I'm a big fan of classic old-school fragrances, but this one seems to be a very cheap and watered-down imitation of the original. Not recommended."
3,Collinsville,"I saw One of the movies on this set, Collinsville, at it's premiere, It is a very good first offering, with the amount of money they had to make it with. The acting is very good, especially the blind shop owner, and the screenplay is first rate. For the price i would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes low budget horror."
4,So far so good...,"Got the Tri-Angle after reading and watching a lot of reviews, they all had positive feedback so I pulled the trigger and got it. Also because the reviews said this sharper was basically idiot-proof, and when it comes to sharpening I am. The base and cover's plastic feels cheap although it serves its purpose, the stones feel hefty and look like they are of high quality material. I have tested it on a few spydercos and got a very decent edge on a delica 4 FFG, no so much on a combo edge endura 4 saber grind, I also sharpend my Becker BK2 and got a very respectable utilty edge on in. The best results I got were with an ESEE 4, I don't know if its because the ESEE is flat ground or has better steel but this baby got a scary sharp edge. Its a little on the expensive side and you will need to get a feel for it, but it does a good job and takes away most of the guessing work, so overall I do recommend it."
2,not that great,"i haven't had much luck getting any of my knives sharp with this system. i watched the video on how to use it but it still doesn't do that good of a job for me. the whole thing seems sort of wobbly and it takes a long time to get an edge, which never came very sharp. maybe i just don't have the knack. i have a small round 3"" sharpening stick from f.dick that works much better than this fancy spyderco system, at least for me, and it only takes a few swipes to get an edge that easily slices through paper.i was disappointed in this purchase and don't use it but didn't return it.i would give one star but maybe it's me so it gets two stars. i don't think it is me though."
4,"Everything they've advertised - razor sharp edges, fairly easy to use","I previously purchased a Wüsthof pull-thru sharpener. It literally ruined my blade edges with uneven edge, gouges, and chips out of the blade.After more research I purchased this product. It's everything they say it is. Obviously a little more difficult to use initially than a pull-thru as you have to practice getting the feel for keeping the blade perfectly vertical while pulling against a single sided stone. But it works great!If you want, you really can sharpen your blades to the point where you can shave with them. Makes cutting in the kitchen nearly effortless, just like when the blades were factory new.I haven't sharpened other cutting edges yet but the videos and documentation show the stones are so versatile you can literally sharpen anything, including serrated blades, garden / shop tools, etc."
1,DONT BUY!!!,"I received the Spyderco model 204 knife sharpener today, May 11, 2010 and this is the worst knife sharpener ive ever used. I have recently ordered the Spyderco Native knife which is excellent however i had gotten a knick in the blade from my physics project :( and i didnt have a knife sharpener anymore(the last one i had was when i was really into knives but i lost it) so i figured that i would order from the same brand. The knife originally was extremely sharp and i was trying to target the tip of the blade where the knick was. I watch the video included, did what it said to do while watching the video and it dulled the blade. Over all its still relatively sharp but fails in comparison to what it used to be. DONT BUY THIS!!! I know what you are thinking, ""well maybe i messed up during the instructional video,"" no i didnt because i rewatched it, took bullet points on instructions and it was EXACTLY what i did. This fails, which is a shame because i love the knives they have."
5,Fantastic knife sharpener,"I went through a few knife sharpening systems including the Lansky looking for one that could produce razor-sharp edges. At first I was a little disappointed with this system. It got my knives sharp, but not as sharp as I hoped and heard it could.After a little practice I got better at holding the angles and using the sharpener, and the result was SCARY sharp blades. This system is easy and intuitive to use, and once you become proficient at using it you will actually have fun seeing just how sharp you can get your edges."
5,Great knife sharpening system,"I purchased this knife sharpening system to sharpen my Benchmade 580 Barrage as well as the knives in myCalphalon Contemporary 17 Piece Cutlery Setand it gets all of the knives shaving sharp every time. I found it much easier to use and much more effective than the Lansky sharpening kit that I used to use. The instructional materials it comes with are helpful and easy to understand, as well as a good source for ideas of other things that the system can sharpen. This system is definitely a good buy."
5,Spyderco ROCKS!!!,This is the best knife sharpener on the market and very simple to use!!! I highly recommend!!!
5,Excellent Sharpening System,"I received the Spyderco system last week and used it over the weekend to sharpen several of my kitchen knives. I also bought the course and extra fine triangles. For practice I used the course diamond Triangles to re-angle an inexpensive 4"" paring knife from 40 to 30 degrees. The Spyderco system was easy to use and it took maybe five minutes for the re-angle. Afterward, I used the medium, fine, and extra fine and brought the knife to a razor sharp edge. Next, I used the fine and extra fine stones and brought my Shun kitchen knives back to the factory edge very quickly. I have several sharpening systems and this is by far the easiest to use for knives. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend the system. Additionally, my son used the system on several of his hunting knives. He was also very pleased and is even using the system to sharpen some of his friend's knives."
5,Pretty much the best thing ever...,"I bought this thing as a gift for someone for Christmas last year and started goofing with it after they opened it up. I was so impressed, I bought one for myself a while later, thus this review. This thing is so simple to use, and does so much more than you realize. I've never gotten my knives this sharp before, and I've got a drawer full or diamond, Arkansas and waterstones, for doing everything from axes to straight razors. I'm no dummy when it comes to using a regular sharpening stone, but this just makes it so easy and fast, it's not a chore to break out and touch up a knife really quick. I absolutely *love* this product. It's worth every last cent."
5,Excellent Sharpener,"This sharpening set is well-designed and very easy to use. It comes with an instructional DVD, but after watching a couple of YouTube videos, I was all set. In mere minutes, I had perfectly sharpened knives. I've only used this Spyderco sharpener set once so far, but I can already see how this thing is worth the price."
2,GROSS.,"This stuff is UNBEARABLE. It is still sitting in my fridge half finished. The consistency is like honey mixed with wall plaster, and it tastes like orange death. I wound up just buying calcium powder and mixing it into some OJ and gulping it down to get my calcium, because every liquid supplement I'e ever tried (not just this one) has been like torture to take!"
1,What a rip,I paid the amount of a full-length movie for this 8 minute short. We barely got the popcorn ready to eat and the movie was over!
4,ok for the price,"just received item have not tested accuracy or product yet, but it is good quatity for the price product description said it had a safety but there isnt one also say it is new but there were very light marks. Over all it looks like a great product so very will update review in a few days."
5,Mystery/Romance,"This is a great book by a great author.Kate Morgan is writing a book about the life of musician James Hayes who died in an airplane crash several years before . She goes to visit his brother Bret to get him to give her information for the book, but he does not want to. They end up spending time together though and soon find themselves attracted to one another. There is only one problem, there is something not right and soon Kate finds out something about Bret and James that changes everything including her book."
1,don't waste your money,"This book may be cheap, but it's essentially useless unless you've never touched a computer keyboard and have no idea what a modem is. Someone clueless might find some help here, but the contacts and addresses--the bulk of the book--are incomplete and, of course, outdated."
3,"I like it, but...","Keep well in the ear. Longer than I expected, but it is not a real problem. It looks like plastic, but I am not disapointed by this purchase."
5,Awesome CD,This album is the quintessential Zydeco Blues recording. Fernest Arceneaux is one of the best Zydeco accordion players in the last 50 years. The rhythm section on this CD is as tight as it gets and when you couple that with one of the greatest Zydeco accordion players you have an album that is just to hot to miss. Zydeco Boogaloo (track 10) has been a Zydeco standard since Fernest first introduced it in the mid 1970's.If you only have one Zydeco Blues CD this has to be the one.
5,wonderful!,"are you planing a new ediction of that book?I got one, but it is writen in spanish and it isfrom 1995 - I need an updated one - best way:in german. Please inform me, where I can get thelatest version as soon as possible. Thanxs!"
3,"Semi-weak, a few gems","Most of the illustrations are rather weak interpretations of the mouse. There are, however, several excellent ones especially ""Vincent Van Goghs to Disneyland"" by Bob Buccella"
2,Would be great if they would stay on,These loosen as you go. The are nice and light but bindings need improvement. Function is good but they aren't the easiest to get on and I end up getting frustrated from them falling off all the time I eventually end up taking them off.
1,Suicide,"The title of this book should have been Suicide: The Fast Track to The Loser Lounge in No-Limit Hold'em Poker Tournaments.This book teaches you how to quickly leave a poker tournament.I've played against players who have used this system before this book was ever written. I agree they might get lucky and go on a rush...but eventually a good player is going to take them out, and they'll never win a tournament with this system....Guaranteed."
3,Wish it were true,"I like the idea of a simple system that makes mediocre players competitive with better players. The Kill Phil System promises this, but I have been watching it fail online and on television. The 2005 WSOP was full of players doing the All In rhumba and exiting the tournament quickly. Online, I play against Kill Phil players regularly at SNG tables and they rarely make the pay level.After reading it, I thought their advanced system was pretty good and use some of the ideas in my own game. So, I recommend reading it. But the folks who use the Rookie or basic system had better get ready for a thumping at the hands of better players."
5,"A wonderfully exciting, fun, and graceful supplement to personal workout and fitness DVD libraries.","Soul Sweat is an interactive dance workout DVD featuring choreographed exercise to a ""world groove"" soundtrack from Vargo, Shaman's Dream, One at Last, Bob Holroyd, and more. The dance steps build coordination, body toning, and stamina; Soul Sweat is a total experience that promotes not only fitness, but also self-expression and sensuality. Soul Sweat includes a 45-minute ""Deep Sweat"" workout with warmup, high-intensity cardio, and cool-down exercise; a 30-minute ""Quick Sweat"" workout with emphasis on high-voltage cardio; and a tutorial section that breaks down the 26 foundational moves into easy-to-learn steps. A wonderfully exciting, fun, and graceful supplement to personal workout and fitness DVD libraries."
4,A hobby gets started.,The product arrived on time and I have begun the planes for the trains ultimate layout. It was a great deal for the price compared to other available options. Thanks
5,Great Book,"I passed my Admin I and II exams using this book. All of the questions on the exams were on the practice exam. If you are looking for a book to advance your career in Solaris, this is the one."
3,Good but weak in a couple of areas,"The book is generally very good but lacks in some areas and excels in others.There is basically no SYSLOG section although mention is made in Part I. On the other side, the section on RBAC is expressed very clearly, better than the Official Sol.8 Sys Adm. Training guide from Sun.The NIS Step by Step was a little confusing but you learn as you fix.Generally a good book but I would supplement it with a Training course or at least purchase the Official Sun Training manuals..."
3,Good reference book; poor certification prep book,"I've taken Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 certification exams and past them both using Exam Cram and New Riders as studying tools.I found that the New Riders provides greater detail, but they don't necessarily follow the exam objectives. In fact, they totally miss parts of it. For the objectives that it does cover, it is very good.There were also errors in the material itself. For this, I rate it a 4 for a reference book and a 2 for a prep book. Averaging those scores, its a 3 in my book."
4,Good for What It is,"This book lists commands and what they do. It does not explain Linux, or how to do things, just what various commands are. It's not a bad reference, although you can get more from Linux man."
5,best little pocket guide thing I've ever seen,Might be confusing for some who don't realize that various flavours of UNINX and Linux abound but so what! This book is not supposed to teach that kind of thing anyway.
5,Pleased,My Carl 15053 Bidex blades arrived promptly andthey are a great tool for cutting and designingspecial scrapbook and paper creations.
3,Just like the original....NOT,"The product they sent me seemed to be in original packaging but was nowhere near an original HP cartridge. If you're not finicky about the quality, its fine. But remember that you're getting what you're paying for here. On the plus side, the merchant was very friendly and prompt to deal with. Excellent customer service."
2,A difference you can tell,"I purchased this one and sounds were barely audible, especially compared to the Littman Cardiology series. The differences were astounding!! Don't waste your money on this! Save up whatever you have and purchase a Littman. By the way, a few other nursing students had these and had to borrow other students Littman just to hear with clarity during assessments. I am an accelerated nursing student and I did give these the good old college try but unfortunately it was a dismal failure. Lesson learned."
3,Sprague rappaport stethescope,"It has reasonably good quality, comes with fee replacement of some of the parts for life.When I ordered it, no mention was made of tubing color. I was quite surprised to receiveone with purple tubing which I consider unprofessional for a physician. When I contactedthem, they agreed to exhange it. The exchange was slow - 15 days. They should havementioned that it came in various colors in the product description. The product alsocomes with the company logo on the diaphragm. I would prefer a plain one, I am satisfied withthe product and I would rate the company as average."
3,Facinating yet vapid,"Diane gives us a facinating glimpse into her world of the fast lane of the 70s and the glamous life which she led. But a glimpse is all we really get and Diane spares us many details which she must have felt would offend the people still important in her life. Further, while she ostensibly takes responsibility for how her businesses went horribly wrong, we somehow get the feeling that everyone else was to blame. Hey, the next time you license your products to Sears, please take a step inside. You will see that it's not Saks! In sum, a fun read but it not a revealing biography or any kind of a business book."
2,Very rigid in her beliefs.,"I wanted to know why OB's suggest the things they do. What this book tells you is how miserable you will be while you are pregnant and how you will never want to have sex again after the baby is born. Very bad for someone to read if it is a first pregnancy, you will be terrified of the Doctors office, the labor, delivery and your partner."
5,Nice piece of equipment,The meter is a bit plain looking but does an excellent job. It is compact and works very well. Amazon beat everyones price. I paid just under $90.00. Some sites charge $149.00.
2,Don't Bother - Phone a Friend Instead,"The advice in this book is the same thing you'll hear from talking with a few friends or in any other baby book out there. There is NOTHING in this book you probably haven't heard before. Added to that, it's very negative - makes it sound like every older sibling will turn into a total terror when the baby comes. Very demoralizing. The author's attempts at humor fall flat. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the advice isn't bad, just nothing new."
5,Never Sleep again,"This is an awesome addition to the Nightmare Series. If you're a fan of it, this is a must have for your collection."
5,Puppy time,"I am rating 5 in anticipation. The dog is a gift that has not been given yet. The quality of the dog is very good as described and it's really cut. The puppet availability is sized for a child's hand which I consider a plus. I think the fact that it is a puppet is going to be lots of fun for the child I am gifting it to, she loves puppets and dogs so I expect this to be a winner."
1,My unit didn't work,"I bought this product to check for a suspected CO leak in a gas fireplace -- I wanted to know just how much CO was in the air, instead of a basic alarm. As soon as I turned on the product, even in fresh air, it said the CO level was 80 and the alarm sounded. Maybe this was an isolated problem, I would assume as much anyone, but regardless, status = 1 defective unit, returned."
3,bulky. works.,"This armband works, but it (through no fault of its own) is too bulky to be comfortable to use while working out. If you aren't using this to exercise, its great; otherwise, take a look at some of the sandisk sansa clip players instead."
3,80 GB Zune 2nd Generation,Does this fit well with the 80GB Zune 2nd Generation? There seems to be a scarcity of quality sports-cases for this version of the player.
4,lee is back!!!!!!,after years of refuseing to play dracula christopher lee returns in dracula prince of darkness. while it takes time to get going and dracula doesn't show up til late when he does this becomes one of the better lee/dracula films. 4 stars thesatanic rites of dracula was the swan song of hammers dracula series and everyone seams to just be going through the the same old routine. a sad ending to a great series.2 stars
4,bugs is wild,Had never heard of this guy before. First listen to the cd and blew me away. Great guitar licks and a down to earth live performance. May have to look at the rest of his releases soon.
4,Great for playstation owners,"I used this on Virtual Cop 1 and 2 for Saturn, but it can also be used on Playstation games such as Time Crisis, and Resident Evil dead aim.This gun has a very realistic look and feel. And the nobes on its side lets you adjust to either single shoot, or fast automatic.Search for it if its out-of-stock on amazon. It is still offered at most game stores."
4,Typical Stanfield Book,"This book is the sequel to Where the Heart Leads. In it Jonathon Brandts sister, Sara comes to live with them. They also have a new hired guy living with them, named Ethan Caldwell. Now lets put our minds together and see what Anita would typically give us. Yep! that's what happens! But even if the plot was typical, it still was a good, quick read kind of book. I really enjoyed it, but Anita darling-get a new plot idea quick!"
5,Great collection of Domino tunes by first-rate artists,"This is a fabulous 2 CD set with performances by a host of top-quality artists. Some you've heard, but others might surprise you. And it benefits the Tipitina's Foundation, which is helping musicians in New Orleans. Give it a try - you will not be disappointed!"
1,You do not get 100 capsules of 1000mg each.,Beware of the fine print. If you buy this you will get 100 capsules of 500mg each. They put 1000mg on the bottle and make it look like you are getting 100 1000mg capsules but give a serving size of 2 in the small print. I got these for a better price at my local Walmart.
3,Works but experienced side effects so discontinued,"This helps metabolize my sugar very well. Unfortunately, this gives me horrific heart burn and therefore I had to discontinue usage. But if you don't have problems with heart burn and you need some to help keep your sugar in check, then this does a great job."
4,Good overview,"This book certainly doesn't confuse the student with too many messy details, but it's good for a general idea of what linguistics are about. The introductory passages for the seperate chapters were well chosen for their diversity and humor, though they weren't always very illustrative as far as the subject in the chapter goes. This book is required reading for all Students of English at my University in Germany, but it is not intended for study in greater depth."
5,Very informative book for the beginning Cello player!,"I found out that I was getting a cello for Christmas and immediately began looking for reading material about care and maintenance tips when I found this book. The book is short, but packed with great information for someone not used to taking care of such a large, fragile object and how to keep it in top condition. There is also helpful information on what to look for in purchasing a new or used cello, as well as a general history. In all, I feel more prepared for when I take the cello out of the case for the first time, and what to look for when and if problems arise."
1,Quirky program made useless by copy protection,"Buyer beware: Final Draft incorporates an archaic copy protection scheme that will drive you nuts. Every other category of computer software did away with this kind of user-unfriendly copy protection scheme in the mid-80s, but the screenwriting software vendors persist. You're probably better off using Microsoft Word (which is far more robust) and using a simple formatting utility when you're project is finished. If you have any hard drive crashes or hardware upgrades and you forget to de-install Final Draft you will lose your install keys. Tech support is scarce and the online help system is only good for the most basic information. While it should make your life simpler this product will make your life hell. Avoid it like the plague."
5,Very Easy & Very Good,Final Draft has created the perfect word processor for constructing scripts. The interface is clean and straightforward. To the beginner it can be used quite effectively after the brief tutorial; for the expert it offers unlimited customization.Quibbles? None really except that you have to 'authorize' the program to use it without having the CD in the drive. Therefore if you write on two computers you will either have to have two copies of Final Draft or put up with having to insert the program CD into the drive of the unauthorized computer.All in all Final Draft 6.0 is an excellent program and well worth the money.
3,A scent that lingers,"I really like the scent of this room spray and bought it with the intention of keeping it in the bathroom. However, its buttery cinnamon scent is better suited to the kitchen and main living areas. It doesn't freshen the air as much as make it smell like cinnamon buns cooking, which is nice depending on which room you use it in."
4,Recommend for L'Amour fans,A nice reward for those Louis L'Amour fans who like movies to go with L'Amour's books. This is not a typical western but deals with boxing which was an important part of western history.
3,Meltdown is coming.,"What is probably the most disappointing book in the 2099 series is still a book that readers will find difficult to put down, particularly because the plot races along with each passing chapter and the ultimate showdown grows closer... In 2099 #5: MELTDOWN the trouble for Tristan grows. He and Genia are trapped in a world so utterly close to its own destruction, a world in which meltdown is causing it to come to a shattering end. Is there anything they can do to stop the ultimatedestruction of Earth -- and its future?"
1,It was good... for the first 2 and a half words!,"Geez, I can't believe John killed off Jame! Okay, okay, I admit, it was cool when they captured Devon and ""Tristan"" and had them fight to the death, but did Devon really have to do that? Also, why did Mora say that she ""liked"" Genia. Does John have issues that we should wonder about? Also, in the story Barton (Was that his name? I forget. Baxter?) was long time friends with Charle, how did that happen, wasn't he a reject. There are an awful lot of plot holes that I wish to be clued in on... is John preparing us for the series finale? That would make sense. But, for all you people that hate disappointments, don't read this book."
2,I guess I'm spoiled...,"after using the ""Creating Motion Graphics"" books by the Meyers for After Effects. They know how to teach! I'm preparing for a job on a big budget animation feature that will use Shake for compositing, hoping to move from the world of Motion Graphics to high-end compositing...W-e-l-l, this book didn't teach me much at all in terms of concepts or the art of compositing. I ""hear"" Marco is a nice guy and an accomplished compositor, which makes the book all the more disappointing. I'm not saying I didn't learn anything, but ""now click here, now click there...and now add this value""...ain't that cool!?"" is NOT truly teaching me anything. The new ""Studio Techniques"" book for compositing in After Effects is excellent. I wish there was a comparable book for Shake. This ain't it...and unfortunately there aren't any alternatives. I strongly recommend reading Ron Brinkman's book, The Art and Science of Digital Compositing"" BEFORE diving into Marco's Shake book."
5,CAJUN MUSIC,THIS IS THE REAL THING VERY CAJUN AND MUCH MISSED-ALL I CAN SAY IS BRING IT ON I LOVE IT
4,very good,"I BOUGHT THE BOOK ""THE MAGIC NESTING DOLL"" BRAND NEW. I REALLY LOVE THE ART WORK AND STORY. HOWEVER I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT ONE OF THE PAGES IN THE UPPER INNER CORNER WAS STUCK TOGETHER,SO I SLOWLY SEPERATED THEM BUT IN THE PROCESS SOME INK CAME OFF ONTO THE NEXT PAGE.I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I FIGURED WHEN I BUY A BRAND NEW BOOK ITS IN GREAT CONDITION. ITS A SMALL DEFECT AND I DO LOVE THE BOOK AND ART WORK SO VERY MUCH THAT I WILL OVERLOOK THIS SMALL PROBLEM."
2,This Latin Vocabulary Flash Card set is not what I had hoped for.,"First of all, the cards are very small and hard to handle. I teach H.S. Latin classes and bought this set as an aide in learning vocabulary. The students don't like to use them as they are confusing, don't have the proper vowel markings, and sometimes give incorrect or incomplete definitions. I ended up making my own sets on index cards because this set does not meet our requirements at the H.S. level."
1,RIDICULOUSLY SMALL,"SO SMALL, REALLY SMALL AFTER A PAGE MY BOY LEFT IT AND HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WITH IT. REALLY DESAPOINTED."
5,Awesome Maze book for young children,"My 6 year old loves mazes and we wanted a small, easy to carry book for him to use when waiting in a restaurant, or store. I can give it to him and he loves figuring them out. Great price, great size and a lot of mazes for a little book!"
3,Not Bad,"The age bracket shown for this book is 4-8 but our 6 year old has quickly mastered the puzzles - they are rather easy. He enjoys them but I can't imagine him enjoying them 2 years from now.So, a good book for kids at the younger end of the recommended age bracket."
5,Wow--what a ride,"Billionaire's ""Acension"" has got to be one of the classiest efforts in years. Not since Nirvana and before that Led Zeppelin will you hear such raw power. Easily some of the best rock guitar work ever. Do yourself a favor--this is one CD you need in your collection"
1,Save your time and money,Numerous omissions and typos made for a very frustrating read. Mislabeled drawings and missing or erroneous instructions made exercises difficult to follow. Fundamental exercises were superficial and fragmented without logical development or context making retention difficult. Rhino's supplied Level 1 and Level 2 Training Materials are far superior in all regards. Don't waste your time and money. The publisher and author were e-mailed regarding problems but no response.
4,Sterling Silver,"This item looks very nice, but when I got it in the mail, it was really tangled up and it appears to have a chip on one of the sides, not very noticable to return, just a small chip. It took about 10 minutes to untangle, but the necalace looks very nice, and is definatly something to buy for valentines day."
3,International scope,"A real strength of this book is its broad scope; both in range of species, and in wide range geographically. Within a few pages there will pictures of the vulturine guinea fowl, the white-breasted nuthatch, and a red-throated diver (loon). The pictures are spectacular, whether it is wandering albatross courtship, an upside-down emperor bird-of-paradise, or a common bee-eater offering his mate a dragonfly. A minor annoyance is that the location of the species pictured is not usually listed. The text covers a wide range of species, and focuses on describing the behavior, but not allot of deeper evolutionary discussion. Some researcher names are mentioned, but there are no citations or sources for further reading. I think the book might be considered an informative, coffee-table book."
4,The best book by ESRI Press for advanced GIS users,"This is by far the most useful book I have ever encountered published by ESRI Press! If you are still using Arc/Info from the command line, this is the book to get! Now, if ESRI would only make the documentation from their classes available for purchase ... that stuff is the best GIS software info available! Unfortunately, you have to enroll in one of their courses, which are by no means, cheap!"
5,Great multipurpose money saver!,"This item was recommended on a review for a similar item on Amazon and I'm glad I went with it. You can use it for more than your Nike + iPod sensor (the other isn't large enough). When the weather sends me inside to the gym, there's room for my car key fob too.The customer service from the Shoewallet company has been fast and friendly."
5,great!,"these are great! they hold a lot more than my old hampers, and seem very sturdy. the do collapse with weight (ie a mis-aimed shirt or a cat attempting to walk on the rim), but no problems. A great deal. They are also a bit wider than advertised if I remember correctly, at 17.5 inches across and almost 22 inches tall, but I managed to stuff them into my alotted space."
5,Somebody who cares,I am glad there are people on this earth who care about their own people. That is what makes this planet so beautiful even though we have so much hatred and negativity going on. I saw this movie and I was touched by it. I am from Seattle and I did not know that there are so many homeless people young and old. I highly recommend this movie to anybody. The one who made this movie did a fantastic job. Both thumbs up!!!
1,Buy the Sega Brand RF Switch,"This Switch screws up your tv picture and distorts the sound ingames making it so horrible to play i threw it out and bought a vcr soi could use the av cables, dont buy this no matter how cheap it gets, i sent the compnay a mail and they told me to send my product in i was like no way im not paying for shipment and they said i wouldnt get a new one or my money back, Nyko Stinks."
5,amazing watch,"This watch is simply amazing. Just purchased the watch today, so I suppose this is just going to be a preliminary review. Buttons to start/stop chrono are a little stiff, but otherwise work really well. The watch's shape fits my wrist very well, and is extremely easy to read.The watch seems to be pretty sturdy and scratch resistant; I wonder how it will do over time."
2,Cute but faulty,"I bought the ladybug and lion hampers. When I received the products, the ladybug hamper already had wires poaking out through holes in the fabric. I expect the other one to give in any time.They look great, it's a very good concept. My daughter can reach in and get anything out as it is so flexible. However, they start falling apart in no time. I would not recommend it unless you don't mind speding $15 just to add something different to decor."
4,Good price for this product,"I loved this product as well. Simiular prices on the net were pretty high and really didnt go with the butterfly theme of my girls room. It is so cute and makes a great addition to your themed room. The only thing is as another customer said, the wire came out so I have to keep putting it back in. Other than that is a great buy."
2,children deserve to have rights,"Children should have the ultimate say in who they want to live with,they should have rights too. He was told by his biological parents he was ""stolen"". With the advent of the internet I am sure he has learned the truth. As it turned out his biological dad didnt stick around long anyway, he left the family for another woman. Children should not suffer the pain of separation like that at a young age I am sorry but that has to deeply scar you for life. If his real father loved him he should have left him alone if he really cared about him; not hurting the child but no, it was all about HIM the selfish bastard...who left him anyway ....another painful adjustment for Baby Richard."
2,Hardly as original as Blood Music,"And the micros are psychologically too much like people. But it does raise a number of interesting points, and it's a fun read. And I wanted to give it 3 stars, but Amazon is insisting on two."
2,The Babble Continues,"Authors Schultz and Schultz start with a solid premise: making sense of the cacophony in the marketplace regarding branding. And while they do a reasonable job of outlining some of branding's ills and shining a light on branding's charlatans and self-proclaimed gurus, I found Brand Babble strangely unsatisfying. With a few exceptions, the authors left me hanging by explaining all that is wrong with current brand-think but failing to provide alternative answers or solutions to all the babbling. That said, I was able to extract a dozen or so nuggets of fresh thinking from the work, so it certainly wasn't a total loss.Mike D--brandworkshops.com"
5,Stunning,"Even though my CD collection is threatening to take over the house, Matt's Mood has to be in my top three most regularly played. I've listened to this literally hundreds of times and there's always something fresh and original happening. This is Matt Bianco at their beautiful, foot-tapping, enjoyable best - not one dull or uninteresting track, which is a minor miracle in itself.Needless to say, the level of musicianship and production is outstanding. The band sounds very tight and together - and it's fantastic to be able to listen once more to Ronnie Ross's gorgeous sax.There isn't much to add to the glowing reviews below. This really is a superb album, and well worth the wait. Shame I couldn't give it ten stars."
5,Savor Matt Bianco's Flavor,"5 stars are not enough! Don't miss this CD... Basia's vocals are fabulous as always...This reviewer finds ""Matt's Mood"" worthy of owning 3 CDs- one for each vehicle and one for the home sound system. Love it!"
4,Good book but errors need to be fixed!!,"The book is well written with good questions. My only complaint is that there are some mistakes (missing labels and wrong answers) which at time can be frustrating or confusing. Also, every answer should say why it is correct and the others are wrong (this is key to studying). Overall, I recommend this book to any resident preparing for the neurosurgical written boards."
4,Easy to read while praying,"I have been using this siddur for mincha-maariv and find the type and layout easy to read and follow. The edition used at my synagogue has nice soft off-white paper that softens my voice during the Amidah, and a spine that rolls open in a pleasing way, with no resistance. I don't know if all the printings are the same.It would be kind of a lot to handle if you had bad arthritis in your wrists or your arms were very weak. I do have a touch of arthritis but not enough to bother me when holding this book.I wish the 95 ""gender-sensitive"" edition had the weekday services, as that is what I primarily need, but the 85 is quite suitable. I like it better than the Artscroll Ashkenaz siddur I had been using."
2,English Translation Issues,"I'm unhappy with the English translation. If you are a beginning student of Hebrew translation, and hoping to improve your skills by glancing at the English while you pray from the Hebrew, this is not the prayer book for you. Nor is this the prayer book for you if you want the English to be an perfect representation of the Hebrew. The English is well composed and forms beautiful prayers. But it is a euphemistic translation: it says what the editors wanted the Hebrew to say, not what it literally says. It attempts to smooth over issues that are embarrassing or impolite. It's a little dishonest to keep the unchanged Hebrew with its infelicities, but ignore the problem by giving a sanitized English translation."
2,Not what I thought I was getting.,This is not the prayer book which I previously owned. It does not have the daily prayers or most prayers for festivals.
5,Our favorite baby item !,"My son has always slept better when swaddled, but he quickly outgrew traditional and long sized receiving blankets. This product has been the best sleeping aid for him, I only wish I had invented it!! When he is snuggled in this, he falls right to sleep. He naps more soundly and he will sleep a 6-8 hour stretch at night (he's now ten weeks old). When I try to put him to bed without it, he usually wakes up within 20-40 minutes fussy and still tired. The only downfall was that he did outgrow the small, but I was thrilled to find out they also sold it in large! It's fairly inexpensive and well worth buying more than one!"
3,Okay for small newborns,"This swaddle is so-so. We have twins and both are able to get loose when they are determind which renders it useless for the purpose.They are now 2 months old but were 6 weeks early at around 5lbs - it was very useful for the first month.I have tried 2 other swaddle blankets and I recommend the ""amazing miracle blanket"" - especially for babies 7lb and more.Unlike this blanket the AMB has no velcro and relies on the baby's weight to keep secure. This translates to a much more robust solution."
3,Not exactly a $10 book,"This is an 11 page book, typed like a middle school book report. There are over 15 pages of completely blank pages. The binding is similar to what you would find at your local print and copy shop. I havent read it yet, but this is not at all what I expected for a $10 ""book"""
1,If an item doesn't fit in a standard Joist space there should be tech spec.s attached to Amazon's sale ad!,"No technical data, (demansional data) on Amazon site, WAM, (Wholesale America), site, couldn't find it on Panasonic site. Who would beleive that a fan's outer dimensions would be greater than a joist space it's supposed to fit into. Return authorization came, they are keeping $100 on a $242.00 purchase claiming a manufacturer restock fee. The box came to me w/ 2 different layers of tape holding it shut, they sold me an open box item and steal an additional restock fee.DO NOT PURCHASE from WAM!! and shame on you Amazon that you don't require tech data to be included in the Ad!!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"This case screams after-market. It fits ok and is plastic so it is durable, but it was cheap and it looks cheap."
2,So cheaply made,"It fit my phone, but within a few weeks, it was already cracked and the color was rubbing off. Such a shame..it's really pretty, but not worth the money. Then..after a month..my phone fell out of my pocket and the cover completely cracked in two. Still, it did what it was supposed to do I guess..it protected my phone from being damaged."
3,neat color,"I love the color, but it wears off. the clip broke. the price was good enough to try. no big deal"
1,Falls apart,"I tried to put this in my daughters bike handles and there is nothing to secure them to keep them from falling out, I thought I should push it in farther and the wind mill part broke off. I ended up just sticking them in the basket and am getting her something else."
2,Cute but not made well,"They are adorable, but fell apart before they made it to the gift table. She never got to use them in full form."
2,Streamers,"Very cute, however, they break very easy. My daughter broke on just getting it out of the package and I broke the other one trying to push it through the hole in the handlebar."
4,Chord Computer,It is funny and useful. I'm glad to have taken it because I had one since 1986 that was broken and I thought it was so difficult to find another one.
3,million dollar strategies...not,"It was an entertaining read but it just did not deliver on its titles promise of providing any ""million-dollar strategies"". It also has a very dis-jointed feel to it-start, stop, start again. Well, after reading it through, that minor annoyance makes sense. This is a collection of articles written by the two authors put into book form so the flow is uneven and a little distracting. I enjoyed reading about the great gamblers and poker players, but it just left me a little disappointed having bought it with different expectations."
4,Interesting Background,"This provides some ""up close and personal"" portaits of a number of persons directly affected by the HUAC hearings and the Hollywood Blacklist. Really interesting look at how individual lives were so drastically affected by this widespread witch hunt (and very relevant to the current state of our society!)"
5,hope for stroke paraysis,"this story tells what one doctor does for his stroke patients. if more doctors use ultrasound like this, it is not widely publicized. some people have remarkable improvement."
4,Good Cent$ Read.,I think this book is a good written--good common cent$--read to anyone who is in the business now or thinking about it. A lot of the information one can get from the internet but--who wants to waste all thier time surfing to get nips and buds here and there when you can grab this book and have it all right in front of you. That's a No-Brainer!! I recommend this book I found it very useful.
5,perfect!,Cuts the foil with just a twist. Very compact. The cutting surface is inside so you don't have to worry about hurting yourself either.
4,Good Cutter,"The cutter that shared a stand with my big 3 lever (houdini style?) corkscrew fell apart early, and I found myself drinking wine that didn't have convenient pull tabs for removing the foil. This one looks ok sitting next to the corkscrew. One of the pictures showed it holding a cork, but you need a small cork or a high force to make that work.The cutter works fine and looks good, but I feel like it should cost $3 instead of $6. I like it, but if I had to pay any more than I did (i.e. shipping), I probably would have gone to the mall or made special trip to the winery to pick up a foil cutter instead."
2,"Good setup and premise, but not very funny","This would have made a good premise for a screenplay. There is a lot of promise in all the puns and role-reversal, but ending was unsatisfying and the story never got funny.The author instead chooses to repeatedly slam the Catholic church by making all of the orthodox Catholics either pedophiles, [trail]-coverers, or thiefs, and all the ""nice"" characters fail to disguise their intolerance of the church.I found the bitter whining tiresome. The author obviously has some issues with Catholics, but only poorly disguised this as a comedy."
5,Fitzhugh Is On a Roll,"After defying the sophomore slump with the excellent ""The Organ Grinders,"" his follow-up to the hysterical ""Pest Control,"" Bill Fitzhugh has established a bona fide winning streak with ""Cross Dressing."" It's mood inhabits a middle ground between the first two books--more emotional depth than ""Pest,"" not as intense as ""Grinders""--but is no less hilarious. His characters are, as always, instantly recognizable and relatable (if that's a word), and he accurately and fairly skewers both the media and the Catholic Church (and I know from where I speak--I'm a practicing Catholic who works in the media!). If you enjoy a very funny and (this is key with Fitzhugh) very VISUAL read, by all means read this book and everything else he's written or has yet to write."
2,Rating my belt buckle,"I'm not very happy wiTh my belt buckle, the on line photo of the buckle is very polished and shiney in real life thats not the case its very dull and the buckle keeps popping off my belt so thats all I have to say .............."
5,unforgettable intelligent pop,"You must hear this album if you like Dido, Katie Melua or just like good music. Joanna has an incredible way with a melody - all the songs are instantly accessible, but like the lyrics, the tunes have an edge and a bittersweet twist. The extremely catchy ""Merry-Go-Round"" will strike a chord with anyone who's ever felt ""middle-aged at twenty-five"" and longed to wake up in a gutter again; ""Rainbow"" is a sweetly ironic hymn to the joys of Prozac; ""Galatea"" blasts a lover who chooses a ""china doll"" over an inspiring, complicated woman. The album ends with the mature, complex ""Today"", which sadly asserts that ""they say that in time we'll be saved - it's a lie - all we have is today."" The intelligent lyrics and haunting melodies, combined with Joanna's astonishing voice - wispy one minute, belting rock-chick the next - add up to an unforgettable album. Check out this unique new artist."
4,Does the Job,"I purchased this root waterer because I live in Southern California and don't want to waste water. I push the rod down in the ground next to several fruit trees I have and then turn on water. I once killed a cherry tree by putting too much water on the roots, and the ground was so hard it didn't drain therefore causing the roots to rot. So you have to be careful, and not over due it. This Root feeder has a lot of plastic on it so it's not as sturdy as the original metal and glass one I had. But if you handle it carefully, and carry it around by the putting your hand on the hose instead of the plastic body it should work just fine. It has shortened my watering time by quite a bit, no longer having to run water and let it soak down to roots. I would recommend this device. I have not used the feeding feature of this feeder. It is a little shorter then the original one I owned, but you just have to bend over more."
3,not sure,Used these and seemed to put my tree into early fall mode by changing the leaves. Turned the grass around the tree very green though.
3,"Oh, the boys could have been better!","Well, 98 fans, this new christmas cd isnt what I would call spectacular. The carols are very boring and plain, but one song is great. Jeff Timmons, sounds beautiful, as always, so I think its worth it just to hear him sing Silent Night! A true 98 fan will go out and buy it though"
4,ARE YOU A CHRISTMAS PERSON OR DO YOU LOOK AT THE GUYS?,"If you are really into Christmas songs than you will love the cd. If you just want to look at the cover then this is not your cd. I like about 8 of the songs. My favorite is This Gift. That is my favorite song. If you like Christmas songs then get it. If you just like the band, then stay away. BYE!"
3,Some nice new and old songs & some bad adaptations to others,"Personally, I think that some adaptations to the Christmas songs were a waste, but I think ""O Holy Night"" was an excellant adaptation to the original. Extremely inspiring. This Gift & Christmas Wish were great originals. I loved them. But the others, after listening once, I never listened to them again."
5,Very Impressed,"When I purchaced this CD I was expecting it to be the same old songs, but I was mistaken. It is a beutiful CD the harmonies are amazing and I like that they did the traditonally songs that the other pop groups don't do. This whole CD is wonderful and I would highly recomend it."
2,Not typical Firehouse material--too country-western sounding,"This CD sounds too much like country music. There is no typical Firehouse song, although the ""hidden"" track is good. There are good songs on the CD, but anyone looking for the hard-rockin' sound of the early '90s will be disappointed. This release is extremely mellow."
2,These don't work well,"This is a good idea, or so I thought but in application this does not work well at all. You have to run it at 500rpm or less and it gets hot fast and binds, a lot. I tried this on a few different types of wood, oak, pine, poplar but it didn't work any better on any of them. I think it might work on very thin stock, 1/4"" or less or on something even lighter than pine, balsa perhaps. I tried two different sizes of this type of saw & neither worked."
1,Don't buy,I bought this drill and it no power I can stop the tip of the drill with my hand. Waste of money
3,Problematic,I have had two of these for a number of years. Problem is they have always gone on and off randomly. Sometimes I am pretty sure it has to do with our cold NW winters and replacing the bulb has seemed to help. However this is why I am searching for two new lights. And maybe these lights are better now as mine are quite old. I am more confused than anything else. The light output is great btw. Alan
4,cool music,"this is cool melodic folk/electronic music....beautiful melodies, hip-hop style beats....Some songs intrumental while others have soft beautiful vocals. Cd should appeal to fans of Badly Drawn Boy, Sea and Cake, Tortoise and maybe even Boards of Canada."
2,Not the voice she once had.....,"As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice. I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit...."
4,Different Premise...,"I thought the premise of ""RAVISHED WINGS"" by Maria Perry was different. I liked it a lot. I enjoyed the characters and the dialogue in this fantasy story too, I think most people that are looking for a book that is different will enjoy this one."
4,Great New Guidebook For Decorative and Art Glass Collectors,"This brand new year 2000 2nd edition volume contains 240 pages of useful information about this fine collectible. There are more than 500 black and white photos along with a 16-page full color section. There's plenty of text in this book including a useful introduction to the collectible, the evolution of art glass 1880 to 1930, diagrams of typical forms of baskets and bowls, cruets and decanters, pitchers and ewers, and vases. Each of these categories is diagrammed with a description of its characteristics, making identification easy. Items are clearly described, and values shown. There is a bibliography, listing of collectors clubs, and location of museum collections. A wealth of information in this handy sized (6 x 9"") softbound volume that's easily carried when you antique. A very helpful publication."
5,Wonderful,"I have every one of his CD'S, this one is one of my favorites. Would recommend to any one who likes gospel music."
4,Great Mix CD with a twist of the violin,"I have always loved her work and wanted this mix cd for awhile. Clinton sparks really know how to put together a good mix cd. this was the first time i heard alot of what I consider miri ben ari gems such as 'fly away' and 'ghetto soldier'. I would recommened it to anyone that has ever liked her in the least, Kanye West has a hugh presence on it as well, having his beats and rhymes on many tracks."
2,Learning how to be funny is not fun at all!,Learning how to be funny is not fun at all! ZZZZzzzzzzz ZZZZZ zzzzzz
1,Poor competition to WWF and ECW CDs,"I bought the CD only because I collect most wrestlingparaphenelia I find. This CD has way too many tracks (26 on a 74minute CD) so you know that the tracks must be short. Plus there is pointless talking and excessive crowd noise to start off many of the themes which is extremely annoying. For example, Diamond Dallas Page talks for nearly 10 seconds before finally hitting the guitar chords of his Nirvana rip-off cover theme. Good for WCW collector's and general fans who want to get any wrestling merchandise. END"
2,Don't Follow My Footsteps,"I regret I did not read the reviews here before I got this CD. Being a diehard WWF wrestling fan I was hoping this CD follows up on the legacy of the WWR volume music series. Instead of focusing on wrestlers' entrance themes, they incorporate a lot of songs from various rock/rap artists. Even worst is that each of those theme songs are around a minute long! Plus some theme's background have the voices of Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan (WHY? )! I find this CD more a promotional item and it is for diehard WCW fans only."
2,...GO FOR THE METALLICA TRACK,"Come on people, everybody knows that this is true. The Limp Bizkit song is not for the true fans of the group. There is no heavy metal parts, and also there is no cussing. The theme songs are way too short. I got it for Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit. The song ""Blast"" is Kid Rock's all time worst song ever. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is that the Metallica song Seek and Destroy"" is on it. If you want true wrestling themes, then go for WWF the music. If you want the real version of ""Faith"", then get the CD "" Three $$ Bill Y""all, the EXPLICIT LYRICS VERSION."
1,Junk,"First I would like to say I just bought this CD because of ICP. After listening to this CD I wish I would have just gotten the MP3. WCW like always drops the ball where WWF exceeds. This album has little to do with wrestling and a lot to do with trying to make a quick buck. The entrance themes are hacked to death, a lot of the other music isn't even really related to WCW in the least, not to say that it is bad music just you could go out and buy the other artists cds and be more satisified. This album is the biggest example of corporate crap out there."
3,So-So CD,"This CD is ok. The wrestlers themes are good, although a bit short. Some of the ""clips"" are good as well( Hogan returning, WCW montage). However, the non-wrestling songs shouldn't be on there. Just another example of why WCW is falling so far behind WWF, and why they're loosing money."
5,"One of the best albums ever and that's the bottom line, son!","This CD is incredible. I popped it in my CD player and instantly became hooked onto this CD. It has a lot of cool songs on it, although they had a small bit of room for a few more wrestler entrances, and even a few full length songs. Definitely worth the money, a must for wrestling fans and music fans. I like Slayer, Primer 55 and the West Texas Rednecks songs best (the last one being a hilarious song!)."
1,AVOID,"I have purchased two of these things. One lasted maybe six weeks and the other two weeks. Why did I buy the second one if the first one lasted for only six weeks? I forgot. The thing seems darn convenient and stores well--it collapses and can be stuck behind a dresser or a heavy hamper. But, and I'm saying that""but"" loudly, the thing has a very dangerous way of failing. It's given its shape by two circular wires in the top and bottom of the hamper. And the ends of these wires are sharp. They're supposed to be covered by some kind of tape that prevents them from sticking through the fabric of the hamper. Those coverings fail, and the wires poke through. With this last experience I was stabbed in my ample gut. Not seriously or this review would be from my law firm, ""Solitary, Poor, Nasty, Brutish and Short."" As it was I just said ""Ouch, daggone it"" and threw the thing as far as I could. Now using pillow cases."
3,"Ok, but didn't last","This hamper is a good, convenient size/shape. The handles are useful and sturdy, and the mesh is nice. However, I had it less than 5 months before it ripped and started to sag and fall apart. The wire that loops around inside the material totally came poking out of the cheap fabric all over (especially the base). I'm pretty sure I wasn't too hard on it- just had it sitting in my dorm and carried it every week or two down the stairs to the laundry room and back. I was hoping for this price it would last a year or two, so I'm kind of disappointed."
2,Eh..,I bought this hamper to bring to school with me and it broke the first time I used it. The handle ripped right off. Its good for around the house I guess but if you need to pick it up and walk with it not so much..
2,Great until it breaks! Cheap!,"So I've gone through two of these things - that's how cheaply made they are. Although, its a great design and in theory looks and works well, if you overload it or use it to carry laundry up and down stairs you can expect that after about 6-8 months of use for the metal framing to pop through the bottom and tear out. It's a shame as otherwise things this is almost perfect. They need to address the design by reinforcing the bottom and adding thicker fabric by the part where the internal spring ends. Otherwise it is sure to break again."
5,Large and sturdy,Title is self-explanatory. I spent considerable time searching for a good and cheap laundry hamper and im very happy with my choice. This can easily hold two loads. Very happy wig my purchase!
1,Worst hamper ever!,Bought this hamper hoping to have a sturdier one than I already owned....what a disappointment. When the hamper is more than half full it tends to tip over and sag easily. Clothes are difficult to get in and out due to the small opening at the top. Definetely not worth your money and frustration!
5,A LOVELY First Edition,""" A Walk in the Spring Rain "" by Rachel Maddux in this First Edition is beautifully bound in green and black, with a picture of lily of the valley on the cover."
3,not the best at all,the visual art is very intense and entertaining and the audio is amazing toosome how it links a story which i was amazedi really thought this owuld be an actual movie though with just dj qbert playing music in the back groundsome kind of trippy entertainment but its not everything is played ouot thru the music which isnt badi just wouldnt bust this dvd out again unless i was having a party or friends over and wanted to put some visual sound on the big screen not something you would really sit down for unless you were tripping out.... good stoner movie
4,Enthralling Book,"Steve Monroe sends the reader back to gritty 1946 Chicago for a pageturning who-done-it. The combination of street slang and tangible, realistic characters pulls you in won't let you go. After the plot gets moving, it moves at a pretty good pace.'46, Chicago has a distinct feel of The Great Gatsby with a bit of Road to Perdition. The dialogue and action are consistent with what you would expect from the city streets of Chicago.This book is an excellent read. It's neither too long nor too short -- worth every minute you spend reading it."
2,Worst Mixes i bought...,I'm really pissed so ill make myself short. The worst extended mixes i bought. Sizequeen - Tribal Madness track was bad as an original - and its still bad when remixed - even Airmale couldnt help. The Darrin Friedmann mix (aka Decibel) is shorter by more then two and a half minutes from the original so why the hell they call it extended mixes!!! They could shorten those crap tribal madness tracks. Javith mix was better on an mp3 then it is on wav... Same with Ohzee & The Butcha mix of Searching. Best mixes are Decibel Feat. La Veetra - I Like It (Whatsa Matta With That Mix) and Airmale - Love Me (Toxic Mix). Rest is CRAP CRAP CRAP!
1,Sad. Simply Sad.,"I thought this would be a good book to compliment the other books on the market at the moment. In reality, it doesn't teach you how to model at ALL! It does show you functions of modeler, but this nothing more than the manual or what you could figure out on your own. The examples are horrific. I mean, the bending and warping of an airplane to show how to use the magnet tool? Why would anyone do this? What pisses me off more is that this book has two halfs - the first being nothing more than a poor demo of Lightwave modeler's tools (only some of them) and the second half is advertising for third party plug-ins."
5,Anatomy of a Golf Course,"This book should be mandatory for everyone involved in the golf game, from players to golf pros, from greenskeepers to supers. Tom Doak has a great following and if the golf boom comes back, he will lead the way. I've only played one of Tom's courses but look forward to trying more."
2,Not for those who feel good about their child,"This collection of short vignettes might be good for those struggling with grief about their child with a disability,those that want to know that there are others who feel that way too.I found the book annoying and upsetting, as I am grateful for my daughter with DS and enjoy her a lot.I was also disappointed that the author chose to try to write almost entirely about disabilities other than DS(Down Syndrome). Her child had DS so she could have shared more of her own experiences and perhaps given the book a little more warmth."
4,When it Works it Works,"It's hard for a band with four individual stars with their own fan bases. Neil Young fans might not like Crosby/Nash or Stills fans especially might not like Crosby/Nash the mellower side of the band, but when it works its good stuff. On ""Out of Control"" a Neil Young song, it works and it is great. ""Sanibel"" is another one where it works perfectly. ""Queen of Them All"" would never have worked as a solo number for Neil, but it works here. David Crosby wrote ""Dream For Him"" and ""Stand and Be Counted"" both good numbers and Graham Nash wrote one good one and one no so good one. Steve Stills best one is ""No Tears Left."" There are a few weak track on here, that makes it a weak 4 stars and worth owning for fans of good folk rock."
3,I've heard enough,"Better than American Dream and Live It Up, but not as strong as After The Storm. It has some good songs and some junk. I am sick of Stills' preaching against the evil white man. Here's a revalation for you Steve, their are good people and bad people of every race and ethnic group! Get over it and get on with your life. It's a pitty that a ""group"" that had such potential has developed into a tired parody of itself. CSN& (rarely) Y had the potential to become THE group of the 70s, but egos stood in the way. As it was (and still is) CSN&Y isn't really a group, but a collection solo artists who get together once or twice a decade in order to attempt to give their sagging solo careers a shot in the arm. What a pathetic legacy for a budding supergroup that produced standards like CSN (the first album) and Deja Vu."
3,"Good, but not great.","I have listened to most of CSN&Y's albums over the years, and ""Looking Forward"" is nothing more than a mediocre effort from a group that has done better things. Of the twelve songs on this album, Neil Young's folky, melodic soft-rock contributions - ""Slowpoke"",""Out of Control"" and the title song,- along with David Crosby's ""Dream For Him"" (unfortunately Crosby's only song here) easily outshine the rest. Most of the stuff on Looking Forward is pretty bland and boring. This album is certainly NOT a good place to start if you're new to these guys. Even the criminally maligned ""American Dream"" from 1988, is a MUCH better album, almost up to the standard of the first(self-titled)album and ""Deja Vu"". Buy Looking Forward at your own risk."
4,I saw them live 1/24 - they rocked!,"I liked the album very much, after hearing them perform it 'live' I like it even more. CSNY still have it (except for Stills, poor guy sounds like he has marbels in mouth)"
4,Harmonic Memories,"I'm enjoying this album a great deal. The CSNY trademark harmonies brought back some great memories from 28 years ago. I like nearly all the songs, but agree with other reviewers that the Neil Young tunes are the best. I can relate to lyrics from all the writers though. If you remember the days of ""Deja Vu"" and ""Four Way Street"" fondly, I think you'll enjoy this CD."
1,A little disappointed...,I listened to the samples and the music sounds silly and shallow. I just hope they don't sound like this in their concert.
4,a sweet mix of reminiscence and sharing the now....,"I've only heard the second half so far, but what I've heard is rave. One song, four part harmony, reminds me where these guys live--neighbors to the now gone Grateful Dead. Another, a sweet ode to an idyllic life on Sannibel Island. The words flow, the music melodic, the feelings of mature men who've grown and shared lives similar to ours--yes, even with the pressures of ""upward mobility,"" the ""worries"" of modern life, we are reminded of how we once dreamed and encouraged to continue dreaming and loving."
2,good intentions,"this disc was a good idea but given the people involved it fizzles real quick maybe three good songs on the whole thing the rest is such a waste its really too bad, certainly is not anything like it was hiped up to be."
3,It's amazing they can do it at all!,"I remember CS&N's first great album, which should have been titled: ""Crosby, Nash & Stills, Stills, Stills & Stills,"" accurately reflecting the level of each members contribution. It's also a fact that the best & worst CD's I own are by Stephen Stills.Love his guitar work and arrangements through the years, particularly on the more obscure stuff.This album reminds me of the story about two people watching a three-legged dog walk:Man 1 says: ""Look how funny that three-legged dog is walking.""Man 2 says: ""It's amazing that he can still walk at all!"""
1,Horrible Installation .. doesn't work,"Like the other reviewers said, this product doesn't work if you already have an old version installed. Tried several times, could never get it working properly. Finally gave up."
2,2000 ford taurus,"I needed this latch for a 2000 ford taurus which is what I ordered, but it came with the F150 style which generally is the same thing with a longer handle, so I had to take it apart and used the springs for the old latch until I can cut the handle off of this one , no time to send it back and wait!"
4,Could be cheaper,Quality product and I could not find anything cheaper made of steel. But it should not cost so much... Comes in different sizes so be careful what you are ordering. This one is legal size.
2,Gathering moss,"Leafing through this yawn-inducing brick of stale nostalgia is like listening to your senile Uncle Walter ramble on about how great things were in the ""good old days"" when gas was 20 cents a gallon and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" was considered the Greatest Album of All-Time. Oh, and he's wearing a Nehru jacket while he's telling you all of this. And the jacket is baby blue with a white faux fox collar. And you really need to get the hell out of there pronto...."
3,"I may disagree heavily, however...","It is because of this book that I got into two of my favorite artists, Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. I guess thank you for that.But of course there are flaws. Sgt. Peppers shouldn't have been number 1. I don't think I'm alone in saying that that isn't the Beatles best work.Also, how could No Doubt's ""Rock Steady"" do better than the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Siamese Dream"" and ""Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness""? It doesn't add up.What I think happened is that the first 150 or 200 albums were very honestly thought out. After that, it was any halfway decent album they could think of.I did find this to be a enjoyable read, but I diagree. To each their own; you be the judge."
5,Life change made possible,"I started to use a review title of ""Life change made easy"", but that just wouldn't be true really. You still have to work at it if you want to change your life. However, I did find this book to be both interesting and useful. It was interesting as it provided a different perspective on change than I had previously encountered and it was useful because you could actually try the different techniques to see if they work.The author's use of imagining is very powerful and can be done with the book, however, you will probably have to read through the imaginations multiple times before you can actually do it effectively. When you can go through the process without interruption (to read the next step), you'll be amazed at how it impacts your sense of being.I enjoyed the book and hope you will too.Tom Carpenter, Senior Consultant - SYSEDCOHelping IT Professionals Succeed"
3,A good read from a great motivator,"I enjoyed reading this book McKenna is great at motivating you to change your life and provides very common sense approaches working on you from the inside. It is not a great book that will radically change your life but it is a good book with good advice, it is a mixture of cognitive psychology and self hypnosis. Here are a couple of great quotes from the book:The changes that matter most are more often changes in perception than changes in the world outside us. And we can change the way we perceive in a heartbeat.Your experience of life is primarily affected by the perspective you view it from. Depending upon the meaning we give to situations or events,we will feel and behave differently.If you like these quotes and you think thinking this way will help you buy the book. If you think this is common sense search else where."
2,Didn't get any results...,"Hey it sounded interesting! So I said what the heck I would give it a try...Well I will say it is relaxing...but I didn't change my life in 7 Days!I would not buy this as a gift for anyone. If you want to try it for yourself then go ahead...I don't know if you can be hypnotized by yourself? Lol...maybe I didn't believe in it enough for it to work! Also it came very quickly, that is one thing I love about amazon!"
1,Broken Link / No response to email,"I too found the link cited in the book to be broken, so I sent an email to the address I found on the www.paulmckenna.com webpage -- no response.I recommend against buying this book. Why reward Paul McKenna for treating his customers so poorly?"
2,The product claims to sync...,"This product claims to be able to sync and charge a Zune. It appears it can only charge, this is very disappointing and NOT what I paid for."
1,Disintegration of talent,"As someone who admired and returned to books like The Gold Cell and The Dead and the Living, I thought The Wellspring was a total disappointment. Olds' weak language and lines (her line breaks demonstrate no attention to craft, as if breaking a line on ""the"" or ""a"" makes the poem somehow more realistic, more sincere) constantly undermine her poems in this collection. She's basically writing dull prose and chopping it mercilessly into lines.And her objectification of her children, who never emerge as people or full characters, is distasteful, since she uses them to her own ends.All in all, a very weak collection."
3,Not sure how to rate this book,"This book was really well-written, as was Kinkade's ""The Many Loves of Parenting"". Really the book ain't the problem. It's Kinkade's apparent mid-life crisis which caused him to leave his wife (the co-author of this book!) of many years and shack up with some sleazy woman. His drinking, peeing on Winnie the Pooh at Disneyland, and a number of things, makes me wonder what went wrong and why he didn't follow his own advice. His artwork has its critics, but the real issue with that is that his money and success apparently went to his head and he ripped off a lot of people.But I digress. The book is good--really good--if you can get past the fact that Kinkade followed none of his own advice and died a broken man."
5,keeping marriage alive and fresh,This tells of a marriage and how it works for the betterment of both parties. It starts with respect for the other and helping them achieve their goals as well as achieving your own. It tells of meeting in the middle and deciding which way to go together. Great marriage counseling advice.
2,Only three games,"I got this game and I do agree this was a blast to play. However, there are only three games on one DVD so you can only play the game three times. So I think for the $19.99, you'd be better off playing Scene it, which has way more questions and younger players can play as well because it is a tad easier."
5,Best introduction guide to threads programming on the market,"This book, true to other Solaris and Sun manual style, is concise and to the point. This is probably the best introduction to Threads Programming in existence. Lewis and Berg's style is almost reassuring as you learn the basics to threads programming, even for non-Solaris users. If the world of computing and how-to books were written in this style, the reader could learn anything."
1,not suggested,"i bought this item but i am actually not satisfied; first its' wrist section doesn't hold your wrist well so you have to take your gloves off to use your hand every time or they fallsecondly its' color is nor black nor grey something unusual, you can't wear them with black jacket they seem poor quality because of pale color.for warmity, if your hands are warm fine it keeps warm but if your hands are cold dammit you can't get any warmeri bought them a year ago but i've worn them just couple of times"
3,Professional biscuit joiner kit,"You can spend hundreds of dollars on a top grade biscuit joiner. This one was well under one hundred dollars. It has sturdy adjustment devices, and seems to have the same features as the expensive ones. I think that it is excellent value for the money."
3,Classic Songs,Has the classic songs from the 80's. After CC left for awhile those songs and albums were horrible. This is a good compilation if you like the original songs that made the band popular in the 80's.
5,Great CD from a great Band !,"This is the first time I purchased a ""Poison"" CD. My listening experience with this band has been only what I have heard on the radio. This is a great cd. It is worth owning all the songs included. Even the few covers sound great.If you ever wanted to have some Poison in your music collection, this is the one to own."
1,dissapointed,I WOULD HOPE THE MARIAH VIDEOS OR IMAGES BUT THE VIDEO DVD IS UNCOMPLETE AND FLAT! SORRY I WASTE MY MONEY BUYING THESE DVD!
4,Nice,"These songs are not available in stores anymore so I was glad Amazon had them. I bought the whole CD for $9.99, downloaded it. Most songs were ok, but I noticed some cut off at the end before it was over."
2,Krush Storage,I liked them when I saw them on the as. When home they collaspe and after a few months the handles tore off. It's made of not heavy cotton material. Really don't care for them.
2,very poor -- it doesn't close well,"If this wasn't such an inexpensive item I would return it, but the hassle is too great."
3,Great to begin your quest of becoming an Author,"Has some questions that you answer in a workbook style to focus your skills and see if you truly have what it takes to begin the quest of getting published in the Children's book genre.Some of the questions were redundant and were repeated (basically) in other chapters. But, you did focus on different aspects of the same question with a new point of view- so it worked out ok in the end."
3,A Good PPV for Smackdown!,"No Mercy 2003 Took Place in Baltimore MD on Oct 19, 2003. good Match between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker in a ""biker chain"" Match. Good Match, this was their rematch from the Hell in a Cell in 2002. The Worst Match of the night was Vince vs Steph in a daughter i quit match. Also John Cena vs Kurt Angle By Far one of the best matches in 2003, Cena became a star that night and Kurt Angle Gets better and better each time he wrestles. If you like Smackdown PPV with good wrestling then buy No Mercy on DVD or VHS its worth till take careshawn"
2,Harper Collins French- English Dictionary,"I have a Collins dictionary from the 1980's which was a much better version. The clarifications were more detailed. I think next time I will buy a Larousse, but this is good enough for school use at this stage."
2,Eye Candy,"Alan Davis is abrilliant artist and his Clandestine was an intersting, if short-lived, idea. But (see you knew it was coming) this is a pointless meeting of the two teams, little characterisation, and no real plot to speak of. There is some nice dialogue but ultimately it doesn't help the book, For fans of Alan Davis's art then its a good buy, but otherwise give this a miss."
5,Still working after 2 years of use!,Allows my husband to listen to football from the TV while I enjoy music in the same room. He uses his better Sony headphones with it. Cheap but works great!
3,Q Bean ST,"This model does not have the built in mic.I bought this to replace a Recotron unit that was 15 Years old but had quit working. This unit is very small and light.You can put it in a shirt pocket and not know it is there. I am hearing impaired and use this to listen to TV, mainly the news. The batteries last about four hours,I just recharge them overnight. The earbuds give OK sound but not great like a good set of headphones."
3,3 stars for Effort,"I got this CD only to complete my White Lion Collection. Overall, I was dissapointed in the CD as many of the songs sound so drastically different than the originals due to the fact that none of the original band members play on this CD. Anyway, at least Mike Tramp is trying to put out music again. He sould get a new band and new songs though, and see what happens. Metal will never die!!"
1,One perspective,This book is written for graduate students of theology. It is therefore a very slow and difficult read for the average seeker of knowledge.
4,"Good cards, not too expensive; wish they were more durable","Excellent cards to supplement a Russian course with. The people who complain about Cyrillic or the lack of a pronunciation key are off base. These cards don't replace a textbook, they supplement one.They are made of thin cardstock and will get damaged easily. Still, at under $9 (discounted Amazon price) they're cheap enough. I'll buy a second set when I need it."
4,Feel healthier taking this,"I bought this product after learning from Mercola interview of Cees Vemeer how important K2 is for cardiovascular health.I hope it's helping in terms of that. I feel better on it and know that it's helping me in other ways.I feel like the product is way too expensive though. This is the drawback. I'd like to know why it's that expensive.Please note that vita K2 functions in body differently than K1. K2 helps plaque not to build up in arteries, K1 helps blood to clot when we bleed.There's a lot on INternet about this."
5,EXELLENCE!,"Domo Ripped it. Great Album man, is what NYC is missing. Waking the Game up cause ni99as is falling asleep.EXELLENCE ALL OVER *****+++ RECOMMENDED."
3,Wind Dog could use a little less wind,"Tom Paulin's excellent new collection of poetry The Wind Dog might be better with a little less wind. Overall, the collection is a glowing example of strong Irish literary heritage. Paulin is best in the sparest among the collection. The simple, lilting language in the title poem recall days when words meant something more than printed letters. They breathe and live as if they are creatures of their own right. Some of the poems which rely less on the beauty of Paulin's dialect tend to be drawn out and incoherent. Paulin is definitely a master of quick impressions rather than narratives. It is in his short images that transport the reader to a new Ireland that his poetry excels. On the whole,the collection is an excellent introduction to modern Irish poetry."
4,Mystical Read.,"The mystic path has never been so simplistically put into words. The wisdom of mysticism is hardily the best philosophy to explicate into tangible, solid practices. The nature of Howard's parables teach truths otherwise missed in daily life. The book hits on key events of typical life as seem from the eyes of mundane trivialities, though later boarders on the line of cultism. I must stress that this book reads well, as it's beautifully narrated through format and relevance. The end of the book leaves the reader with tough choices, being that the book easily compels the reader to 'act' by quickly adopting many of the advice scattered through the chapters, the final step might be beyond the realm of possibility for most. Whether you choose to fully implement your Cosmic Power into your everyday life and seek to conglomerate with others of the same 'mystic level', or extract key concepts in which you will utilize for selfish purposes, The Mystic Path to Cosmic Power will get you there."
1,Is it possible?,"I completly dislike this video, I was very angry to buy it. In fact, there is very short scenes where you see a girl dancing or just moving in a bad reproduced atmosphere. All the girls and all the scenes are awfull filmed, unsexy and uninteresting! Short speaking, don't buy it, but if you like to boring you...P.S. sorry for my awfull expression in english, next time I'll try to do better..."
2,made me feel worse,I couldn't read the whole book it just made me feel so miserable.It was kind of one of those change the way you think and you will feel better.
2,Poor technical quality flaws possibly great documentary,"The replacement DVD I received had the same problem the first DVD I bought: out-of-sync sound track. This documentary could be a real jewel, especially because of the Peter Coyote narration, if the sound track problem gets corrected."
1,Can't Afford It,"I think it's sad this video exists, yet the average person cannot afford to purchase it. It sounds like an awesome video. Why, all of a sudden, has it become so expensive? When I first ordered it, the price was around $15. It didn't come and didn't come. Finally, I was told it was no longer available. I see that it certainly is available, but who can afford it?!"
4,"good cd, worth the purchase price","I dont enjoy a lot of pointless remix club oriented cd's, but this one as with a handful of others, is quite stomachable. actually, i think the greg reely mix of deception is excellent, which is a few marks above just stomachable. that mix is worth the price of the ep alone. so those of you who were looking to see FLA on the tour that seems to no longer be so, just buy this and sit at home. tomorrow is another day."
4,Wonderful photos,"I found this book most interesting just because of the old photos. While you do look at the then and now shots and see how much has changed, it seems like most of the changes don't have a lot to do with fire. Most of the old photos were taking from development locations, be they mining operations, railroad construction, or town development. So when compared to the current photos the manmade destruction of the land is long gone. It is amaizng to see how the land will return to its wilderness origins once the hands of man are taken away."
5,"Sturdy pot, delicious coffee","I have been using the musa 4 cup maker for a little over four years now, and I love it. I have used it on gas, electric coil, convection, and radiant cooktop stoves (as well as coleman and MSR backpacking camp stoves) and all worked just fine. On the flat (radiant or convection) top stove, I put it on the edge of the smallest burner and let the handle hang off so it doesn't heat up. Never had a problem with it getting too hot or melting at all.I have only just replaced the gasket, but mostly because it started to give the coffee a funny smell/taste after I left it on the burner a little too long. I have used it up to three times a day, every day, and the rubber gasket has held up all these years. The gasket is ragged and stained, and the outside of the pot has discolored a bit, so it doesn't look pretty but still makes the best tasting caffe I have ever had!"
1,poorly built,"A friend gave me this pot, and I was so excited. Then, when I had used it for a short time all kinds of stuff began to go wrong with it. The handle kept coming loose and will not stay on tight. The bottom is difficult to remove for cleaning and making coffee. The gasket is rubber and I think cork might be more practical.Also the 4 cup label is not 4- 8 oz. cups. I'm looking for a new pot."
3,"Interesting story, poorly written","The Drowning Tree is an interesting enough easy-read mystery. However, several times while reading I found myself cringing at typos that an editor should have caught and obnoxious redundancy. Call me pedantic, but it bothered me. It would seem that Ms. Goodman doesn't trust her readers to remember details they read just paragraphs before. Additionally the plot twists were quite facile and the over-development of some characters didn't make sense as they didn't factor into the untidy denouement.Overall I found the book to be a good vacation read, but not a quality work of fiction."
3,high hopes- not quite fulfilled,"I read this book while I was on vacation on the banks of a lake. Its suspense and atmospheric qualities drew me in for most of the book but i found the resolution to be a disappointment. Later, I read ""The Lake of Dead Languages"" and it was just wonderful!"
5,perfect for college,"My daughter received this storage container after her high school graduation, and I purchased 3 more.It will be a perfect laundry container when she goes to college, it's sturdy, has handles that are comfortable to use, and stays in an upright position. It's also great for storing shoes, or any other items."
3,"Great design, materials just okay --but we used heavily","Our sailing school and charter company needed an affordable way to tote linens to the boats. These are an excellent size, shape and color. They collapse to a reasonable size for storage on a boat and are well constructed. The handles and frame are holding up perfectly. The outside, though, picked up dirt easily and cannot be washed --so not recommended for outside use. The inside is water resistant --like a cheap version of oil cloth. At first this was was wonderful, but after 6 months of use, the inside is peeling and cracking. For our home, we have a couple that we use to tote our recycle to the dump --this level of use has worked well. We do recommend them, but we need to note that life can be limited with heavy use."
4,Tuff and compact (great luandry baskets),"We have 3 of the Krush storage containers. We use two for laundry baskets as they fold away when not in use, are very easy to carry with one hand with the strap. Another my wife keeps ""SHOES"" in, easy to drag out and look through. This is a true canvus product and very well made. As we live in a 45' motor home the fold away feature for out of the way storage is wonderfull."
5,Another repeat buyer,"I bought this based on the other great reviews. Just like many of them, I now have three of them. My wife is a photography and uses these to lug around heavy equipment. Then she wants another for groceries, and another for kids, and another for photography and ...you get the idea. They are just really handy. I highly recommend these as a gift for someone who seems to have everything! They probably don't have one of these and they will appreciate it!! They are wider than they appear to be and they fold down to save room when not in use. Maybe someday, we'll get rid of all our bulky laundry baskets and just use these!!"
2,no originality,"Note that she makes a tolerable Mercedes Soza. Go buy the original. It is not the voice. She has some. It's the repertoire. Its not ""Nicaraguan music"" but leftist Latin American standars. Why she ""sell"" this as original, or ""esential""? Come on."
4,"""People of the Lie""","This books was recommended to me some time ago. I bought this one for the brother.What this book did for me, in this world we live in, was to ""define evil"" in its less than apparent form(s). I'm a-religious. While I knew evil was alive & well, I couldn't with any certainty define it. Much evil is obvious, but the insidious kinds, as defined in the book, is what I was looking for. I could feel it, but could not define it."
2,A new stereotype for the definition of evil.,"This book has some vauable insights: that the source of ""evil"" is lying, a refusal to self reflect, and narcissism, but I believe the term ""evil"" is frighteningly simplistic. For true healing to take place, judgement must be suspended. If a therapist judges a person as evil, whether it be the client or the client's parent, I cannot see how the client can be helped. If the purpose of this book is to protect oneself against evil by being able to define and recognize it, then it only serves to encourage closed thinking."
3,Personality Disorders Exposed,"At least 70% of this book is clinically excellent and an honest expose' on a group of very serious and pervasive mental illnesses which fall under the broad category of ""Personality/Character Disorder"". Several glowing examples of the impact and danger of people so afflicted are presented in an easily understood manner. Unfortunaely Peck (like many mental health professionals) has his own psych peculiarities and subsequently also uses the book to broadcast them via his own non-scientific, subjective and somewhat laughable religious explanations for such mental illnesses. This seriously impacts the otherwise inscrutable credibility of the work. Stick to Psychiatry Dr. Peck, and leave religion to the B.S. televangelists!"
1,Ok then...,"Now where to start on this book...I found the case histories very interesting and agreed that these so-called 'evil' people where indeed greatly disturbed. However, Dr Peck's extremely free use of the word evil became quite annoying amongst these interesting stories. His continual finger pointing and at times paranoia about 'evil people everywhere' was very off putting.He also claims to be 'not really religious' but quite clearly literally has the fear of god in him. There is no shame in being a religious person so I was left wondering why the charade?I think there are truly evil people out there but I hestitate at throwing that accusation around to so many. I think most of the people in this book were just plain ignorant and selfish. Dr Peck mentions that all lying is evil. Well with this I disagree, surely there are times when it is called for? I think Dr Peck is confusing being evil with human nature."
2,Wouldn't read it,"This book, I don't know if I would recommend this book, in fact I wouldn't. Nothing more than a journal of a psychologist. Very boring at times, trivial and unpeaking at others. I had high expectations for this book, disappointed. Glad I bought it though, Used. May come to appreciate it later. Also, has a religious side, so if you're not into that, this is not the book for you. Throughout this book the psychologist seems just as confused as the reader, and does not come to any thought provoking conclusions. I could not finish this book, although I'll try to. Made it through over 100 pages, hopefully it gets better.."
1,Therapist gone wrong,"I read Dr. Scott's book, and I was appalled by his clinical interventions. The patients presented tended to be quite impaired, but he did not adjust his approach to match their clinical needs. He used psychoanalysis to treat people who would not be able to tolerate this treatment's regressive demands. He failed repeatedly to address this, and therefore blamed the patients and calling them ""evil"". Moreover, he has no insight into his own countertransference, an appalling oversight that can only end with damaging patients, and causing a serious regression with significant impairment. Moreover, he has absolutely no cohesive picture of his philosophy, it is simply an extremely disorganized distortion of bits and pieces that he has pulled from a wide variety of disciplines."
1,Not a null modem,"Like the others who have reviewed this, it's not a null modem. It's a straight pass-through. This is despite being labeled a ""NULL MODEM"" on the orange band around it."
1,Not a Null Modem connector,This is not a null modem connector. It is a gender changer. Should have listened to the reviews... Amazon needs to correct this problem....
4,Non Contact is the Way To Go,"I am using this Sensor for work and it has not let me down in the slightest, It has an adjustable sensitivity level so it can read even through thicker walls. Worth the Price"
5,CABLE CLIPS,"Hello guys, the cable clips that i got from you guys are more sturdy than the ones i picked up from my local H-Freight Co. Thanks for a in my price range product worth writing about!"
3,Cable Clip,"Item used for surveillance system and it works like it was made to do, would recommend this product to anyone needing added hardware to their system."
5,parttimer,"The advantage to these is the cable saddle is actually a little more than 180 degrees, so they actually clip onto the cable, This way, you can use the cable to position the clip for nailing...which keeps your fingers away from the hammer. Price is good, and seller service was also good. Pleasantly surprised for such a simple item."
4,"If you want to plant a hummingbird garden, this is it!","This is a bright book with beautiful photography that will keep you looking, however, it wonderfully distills plant information into a concise and useful format that will keep you gardening. No mumbo jumbo or trying to beat you over the head with how difficult or how much of a green thumb you need to plant these flowers and have hummingbirds attracted to your garden. Makes me think we all could do it!!!"
2,Ok,"It's VERY large. I liked it a lot at first, but I'm. using it in my icemaker and it seems like the rubber on the handle is coming off as black sludge. Given that the reason to buy stainless steel is for water exposure, I'd look for something that was all steel, or had a better handle, which of course is tough to figure out online"
1,very upsetting,The packing of the items were horrible. They were wrapped in paper and lying on there side when I received them. 2 of the 3 I had to replant cause they fell out of the pots and the dirt was everywhere. Just was so disappointed.
5,Great !,"All pastors who do counseling couldimprove their therapeutic skills by reading this book.It provides guidancefrom the first interview to the last.Charles Whitfield M.D. Atlanta, Ga"
2,ok for starters,this book is people who have never or hardly played tennis...most of the tips are common knowledge........not for experienced players
4,"Everything included, just one grip........","This book has it all and I do mean it all. Everything from detailing fabrics and how they are constructed, a section devoted to needles, scissors, thread you name it. It also goes in to good detail on how to read, adjust, and cut out patterns. The only complaint that I have is the photo illustrations at times it is hard to understand from them what is happening. However the description under the photos helps to clear up some of the confusion. It would make a very nice addition to any library."
2,Downright Mediocre!,"First let me start off by saying I am one of the so called 'Mature' listener's who likes his music on the mellow side.But with this cd something Is missing.For one thing,I have to turn up my system loud to understand the words as the production team did a lousy job with the sound.A few of the songs are okay, but just not enough to hold my Interest.I have been a fan of Jazzhole for years now, and feel that they just did not put enough spark Into this cd.Anyway, I would pass on this one and hope that their next offering Is better."
1,File under easy listening,"I was looking for something to bridge the gap between Chet Baker, early Miles and Thievery Corporation - something jazzy but with a groove. Cirle of the Sun is jazzy and has the production values of TC, but it has no soul or groove. This is yuppy jazz - the kind you'll hear on the smooth jazz station, sandwiched between Kenny G tracks. The word ""ersatz"" comes to mind, though it might help to think of the music as new-age meets smooth jazz meets world music. Not my thing."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!,I got this control today for my laptop to play some SNES games on my emulator and it did not work! It actually made the emulator crash and when I downloaded another one the control still did not do anything at all. I then thought I'd try it on my PC and it still didn't work. I expected better from Phillips...don't think I'll buy PC related things from them anymore!
2,Average,"This book was ok. For light reading I suppose it's good but it was too easy to figure out the identity of the murderer and, frankly, I was a bit bored"
4,OK for price,"It's pretty sturdy and the drying rods stay in the socket pretty well. Color coding makes it easy to assemble. Downside: After several uses, the rods bend. But then I just twist it the other way so it'll even out."
3,not a very good drying rack,"the rack is not as good as it looks in the picture. not very steady, and it seems that it will collapse if I put some heavy winter clothes on it."
5,Excellent Story,The cover caught my eye and I bought it on a whim. This book turned out to be a non-stop read from beginning to end. I especially like the characters and how the story evolved. I'm rushing out to buy the first book to continue with this one the ball detective from Harlem. My hats off to this new detective series. I can't wait for Mali to solve more crimes.
2,for the novice,I have read several books on feng shui so I would categorize this book as introductory but effective. This book is very basic and tends to skip around alot. It is for the novice only.
3,HUH?,"I love Olivia. This compilation looks nice, but...THAT IS NO WAY OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN on the cover..It looks nothing like her. Did they mess up when putting this import out overseas and put someone else's picture on the cover?"
5,Ignore the sourpuss,"Ignore the sourpuss who has had too little literature in her life. This book is wonderful and, yes, magical, and even my young daughters understood that one wouldn't really try to feed a wild deer. By the way - we ""urbanites"" probably have more close encounters with deer these days than country folk."
1,D'oh!,"This has nothing to do with our favorite Springfield family! There's no nuclear power plant, no Moe's Tavern, no Chief Wiggum. I doubt the characters' hue even approaches the ""yellowish"" spectrum. For shame, John Malcolm, for shame. Worst book ever!"
5,Great book for the snowy months,"If your pre-schooler loves vehicles, this book will be a great addition to your library for the snowy months. BONUS, if your pre-schooler is a girl, this book has a female snowplow driver! My little girl can't get enough."
3,"Not Brilliant or Fascinating, but Interesting","Good news first; family, friends, and non-military should really like this book. Others like myself who are retired military, served in Vietnam (Pilot 192nd AHC 68-69), and have written a book about this war might question this author's intent. After ""Kill Me If You Can, You SOB"" came out, I started reading every book about the Vietnam War I could get my hands on. So far about half of them have screamed out, ""I want to be in the movies."" This is one of those books."
4,A great gift for a 5 y.o.,"I gave this to my 5 year old granddaughter & she loved it. The kit is designed such that she can create a beautiful picture independently, with little guidance from me other than to get started."
3,"Lots of fun, but not enough tissue squares","This is a great craft - lots of fun. I like the idea that the boards are self-sticking, so no runny glue mess. Unfortunately, there are not many tissue squares included. I guess you can buy your own tissue paper and cut into squares, but that's a bit of a hassle. If you want a similar tissue art kit for older kids (10,000 tissue squares), check out Lakshore Learning."
4,quality time,"I did the bird with my 5 years old son. it took us a very long time to do it.It gave us time to talk and to share ""quality time"".....the outcome is very nice. the only problem is with the glue ."
2,Very frustrating,"Bought the Phase Brew HG coffeemaker. Made great coffee, but the carafe leaked onto the countertop whenever I poured. Customer service sent a second carafe, then a third carafe. All had the same problem. Finally, they offered a different model. I chose the NHB-B. Makes even better tasting coffee. But -- on my third day of using it, I had coffee all over the countertop! I was filling a quart thermos, for work. Fully 1/3 of the pot was lost. Will be calling their customer service after sending this. They have been very responsive, but if they cannot fix the design problem, then it doesn't really help."
5,"BUNN NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black","Just like the ad says, It will make coffee VERY, VERY fast!The flavor is so much better than Mr. Coffee, no burnt tast."
2,Bunn coffee maker a disappointment,I recently purchased a new Bunn coffee maker from Amazon. The problem with this coffee maker is that the water flows through the grounds so quickly that the coffee is very weak when you use a normal amount. I have gone to using 3 filters in order to slow the flow down which works a little bit. Instead of being so set on brewing an entire pot of coffee in 3 minutes Bunn should have considered the quality of the coffee first. I know people that are literally using 3 times as much coffee to get a decent cup out of this brewer. I have had Bunn's in the past but must say this will be my last.
4,Bunn coffee brewer,"This is our second Bunn like this. Our first one lasted many years. My only complaint is the decanter. It is tricky to pour from. The spout needs to be redesigned, but this is a common complaint, and Bunn has not fixed it, so we live with it. It helps to open the lid when pouring. Coffee from the Bunn is worth the inconvenience!"
1,Disappointed with My New Bunn,"I did a review for the original Bunn coffeemaker and had it for 11 yrs with no problems and loved it. Not so with this version. I had to use a lot of coffee just to get a good strength. Plus, it leaks water a lot. I never had these problems with my other one. I was so disgusted with it, that I bought a Mr. Coffee and retired this one. It takes a little longer, but it also has an option of pouring a cup during the brewing, so the wait really isn't a problem. What a disappointing waste of money."
3,"I like it but,,,,","This our fourth BUNN coffee maker we have purchased in 20+ years. So we do like them. The unit has forced water over the filter section causing a large mess to clean up. BUNN still brews a good cup of coffee and far and away the quickest so what can one do? We have had two develop leaks.Like I said, we like the BUNN, but why can't they build a better quality device. It is made in China.Well well - I have to amend my review. I called Bunn customer service. They sent me a new water disc thing. Problem fixed. Problem solved."
5,A Good Choice,This product is highly recomment to coffee drinkers. it is great and easy to operate. you have coffee in 3minutes or less. you make a bigger investment i know however it is worth it. treat yourself to this product and you will be well pleased.
3,Inconsistent,"I bought this Bunn NHBX to repalce a Mr. Coffee brewer that was a year old. I am still struggling to find the right amount of coffee to use. I use ""Dunkin Donuts original ground"" & unless I nearly double the amount of coffee the flavor is weak! I am wondering if I should switch to their dark roast coffee or try a different brand altogether! Help needed. Does ordering the slower spray head help with the flavor?I do shut the switch off after my morning coffee & I turn it back on for my evening coffee and then back to ""off"" until the morning comes.I have not had any problems using Melita coffee filters."
1,BUNN NHBX-B coffee maker,"I bought this coffee maker thinking it would be comparable to the superior taste of coffee made in the commercial BUNN coffee makers at fine restaurants. However, the coffee from the home version does not stack up. It comes out very weak when using my usual amount of coffee. I had to double the amount of coffee to make a decent cup of coffee and it still lacked the rich taste of restaurant coffee.Very disappointing!"
3,Disappointed in this model,I owned a Bunn prior to buying a Cuisinart which leaked after 2 years so I bought this Bunn last week. I'm very disappointed in that the coffee does not stay hot at all and there is no setting or adjustment.I also don't like the lid design as it is cheap and spills when pouring. I would not buy again. I am going to return the unit if I can
5,EXCELLENT Bunn Quality Maker,I bought this coffee maker a few weeks ago to replace my mr. coffee digital brewer... and I couldn't be happier. I started drinking coffee when I was 4 yrs old. My great grandma used to give it to me in little china cups. This Bunn brewer brings back that old school flavor. My grammy would be proud!
4,Really enjoying my BUNN,Having quick and very delicious coffee at my fingertips is a great way to start these cool mornings we have been having.
3,Made in China,This coffee maker is made in China. Only the BX model is made in USA. Sad you have to order and return to see one that you think is made here is not. Youtube is a good source for finding US made goods.
2,Annoying to use and makes a bad cup of joe,"the concept of this machine is a nice one in principal. Water is always hot and easy and quick to get a quick brew. however, first problem is that it lacks a timer, but thats ok because you know that going in. The quality that it produces isnt anything great if you like good strong brews.The real problem is that after having this for a year, it stopped calibrating properly and i would pour in 4 cups and get much much less. Additionally, it stopped brewing the coffee and now the water pours through as if from a faucet without giving the grinds any time to give it any taste. So i end up with a smaller cup that tastes like hot water with a splash of coffee flavor. Definitively not worth the $100. for that price you can get a good machine that grinds your beans fresh and has a timer. Avoid this one if you can."
3,Good for offices or big families. Wasteful for the individual.,"Bottom Line: This machine makes great coffee.BUT...You can't just make one cup.I have to use more coffee to match the flavor and strength I'm used to. I think it has to do with the basket filter. My last machine was a Krups with a cone filter.This machine has a tank that stays hot all the time. That is SO UNNECESSARY and wasteful. It's warm to the touch, so it won't burn you, but keeping a steady temp for the tank does not make the coffee better, and it only brews slightly faster than the Krups did."
4,Good Coffee,"I purchased this coffee brewer for my husband for Christmas. He really enjoys the coffee maker. I would have given it 5 stars if the hot plate would keep the coffee hotter. I think this may be some new federal regulation or maybe coffee makers are afraid people will sue if the coffee is too hot, but we have gone through more than one coffee brewer looking for a hot plate that was hotter and have finally given up."
3,It's just OK,"I don't dislike this machine but the cons are it makes weak coffee if you don't use alot more grinds. I've noticed it helps to use a 'strong' coffee type and it also helps if you make at least 8 cups at a time. Four cups comes out weak. If you make 10 cups you need to use the special filters as the large amount of grinds spill out. If you make less than 6 cups you can use a standard filter. I turn on the warm plate button minutes before I start the brewing otherwise the coffee isn't as hot as I like. Also the stainless water tank looks similar to a tin can, not like your stainless steel appliances.I do like the speed in brewing. It does make a fast pot of coffee and it tastes reasonably good. We've used it daily for months and have had no leaks from the machine.Don't think I would buy it again. It's based on an interesting concept (always heating) but I'll probably go back to a regular coffee maker that allows you to pull the carafe during the brew cycle if you're in a hurry."
3,had to return it,"I ordered a black machine, it came in a black box, but was white. The carafe spilled when pouring. I contacted BUNN directly and they made everything right with no questions. I think I was sent a returned machine originally???"
3,It is always on?!,"I recently purchased this coffee maker based on the rave reviews. I do think it makes coffee astoundingly quickly, however, I did not realize that was because the coffee maker is ALWAYS on (unless you turn it off) in order to keep water hot in the tank all the time. I only make one pot of coffee per day, in the a.m., so keeping water warm ALL the time doesn't seem very efficient, kind to my electric bill, or kind to the environment. If you turn it off, there is a series of steps to go through to turn it back on in order for the water to heat and the unit to work correctly, it is not as simple as flipping a switch. If you make several pots of coffee a day, I think this is better suited for you."
2,Cheaply made,"Plastic top, into which water is poured, is separating from the stainless steel tanks. The basket also tends to spill over. Spend more money, get something better."
1,didn't buy,After owning our second Bunn it broke so it was time for a new one.(Each one lasted about 10 years) Well - when I went looking today I was shocked by the inferior quality of the new Bunns compared to my old one....to make a long story short I couldn't bring myself to spend the money...so I bought a different brand...Sad to see such a good product cheapened......
5,Consistantly good coffee,My old Bunn coffee pot began to leak after many years of daily use. I replaced it with the same model and I'm happy with the updated chrome and black style. I checked out other models but came back to this one. I grind my beans right before making coffee so I didn't want a programable model. I also didn't want a thermal decanter because they need to be preheated with hot water before brewing so the coffee doesn't cool off warming up the decanter.
2,Bunn Coffeemaker,I have had my bunn coffee maker for about one month now. I have several issues that I am trying to work out with the company. It does brew a pot of coffee fast but it take a long time to drip from the filter. Which a sneak cup feature would be great. Several times I have put my pot of water in the maker and it starts running out even when I have the lid all the way to the back. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does'nt. Not in love with my coffee maker by far.
1,Bunn doesn't seem to fit,"The Bunn is the 3rd I have owned and someting is very wrong with this one! The glass pot doesn't fit the warming element as it should. It slides around. The pouring spout is too shallow,causing coffee to spill whenever you pour. Not at all as good as the quality of my last too. I would not recommend?"
5,Will always own one,If you like coffee house coffee then this machine is the first step to doing it at home. It has the same function as the commercial BUNN makers at the resturaunts.
2,"Easy to use, follow up","I like it but it takes a bit of getting used to. I also do not leave it on all day as I brew only one two pots at breakfast and then nothing until the next day. I was disappointed in the quality of the plastic filter basket and carafe top. Just not up to the quality of the rest of the machine. I also use the regular ""Mr Coffee"" basket filters and they work just as well or better than the Bunn filters. I would have given it 5 stars but for the plastic quality. The coffee is excellent and brews remarkably fast.Follow up: The coffee maker worked well but failed to keep the coffee as hot as I liked it. One of the reasons it was purchased in the first place. I took it out of service and am using an old fashioned ""Presto"" perc now and find the coffee just as good and hotter. The Bunn was OK but just not good enough for my use."
3,Could be improved,"I was expecting a little more than what I got here. The drip does not stop when you pull out the carafe. I don't function that great when first waking up and don't like to invest much time to move before my wake up shower. This brews a pot of coffee pretty quick but there is no timer on it. I was spoiled before with just setting the timer on my old coffeepot and my coffee would be done and ready when I got out of bed. I don't really see a difference in the taste or temperature of the coffee from my old coffee pot. I may repack this one up and re-gift it to a friend or maybe my mom, would be perfect for someone who is not on a time schedule and doesn't mind waiting."
5,Bunn coffee maker,I've owned one other Bunn coffee maker a long time ago and thought I'd try another one. I love it!!! I would recommend this coffee maker 100%
2,Bunn failure,"If you want coffee spilled all over the counter, buy this model. It brews the coffee satisfactorily, but when you pour it from the pot it spills MOST of the coffee. The design of the pot is horribly flawed."
1,horrible,the product was in terrible condition I had to throw it out didn't want anyone else to get it. The box it came in in was soaking wet the pot was in terrible condition looks like it was never cleaned thank you
5,like it,This my second or third Bunn. They last forever with constant use and forever is 15 or so years. The new lid on the water tank concerns me if with use I break it. (The water doesn't pour until it is closed.)
5,Love it!,Best coffee maker I have ever owned. Only drawback is the carafe the tends to spill when pouring. After a little practice this is not a problem any longer
4,Bunn NHBX-B Contemporary 10 Cup Home Coffee Brewer,This is my fourth Bunn coffee maker. I have always liked how fast coffee making was with a Bunn.The last two I have had have been a real disappointment. The coffee pot has permanent water marks etched into the coffee pot.It also has brown stains on the sides - can't get off. On the outside of the coffee maker itself there are corroded water marks thatdo not wipe off - you have to scrape the build-up off. When you slide the top to pour in the water - there gets to be a build-upof water that gets just crusty. When this is scraped off it just comes right back. I have to ream the coffee maker out monthly ormore since it slows down so much and takes 20 min. to brew a pot. I do the vinegar treatment and then have to brew about 10 potsto get rid of the vinegar smell/taste! So totally unhappy with this coffee pot - I will not buy a Bunn again. The qualityis just poor. They used to have such a reliable coffee maker. Not anymore!
1,Only thig good about coffee maker is that it is fast.,"This is my first 1-star review. I am really unhappy with this coffee maker. The pot itself is so poorly designed that it impossible to pour from it without spilling. Inexcusable. People have been making pots since pre-history.Secondly, there is no way of knowing how much water is in the reservoir. Hence no way of know how much water to put in the top. Leading to overfilling and overflowing and a mess or under filling and having to add more water after the drip has stopped.Thirdly paper filters that are commonly available do not fit. They are too short. There is no permanent filter available that I know of.Lastly, mine leaks and I have only been using it a month."
2,Disappointment,"Own a year. Does make coffee quickly. Drip coffee taste acceptable.Cons: 1. No hold and brew. Water into tank, and it begins leaking water into carafe. If you have fresh grounds, it is spoiled by the water sitting in the carafe for hours. Even before you set up fresh grounds to drip, it will leak water onto warming plate.2. Manual on/off for warming element for carafe. If you forget to turn heater on, you get lukewarm coffee.3. No automatic brew. Everything is manual.4, No ability to serve before brewing is totally complete, and no indication of completeness, except visual on the grounds basket.Opinion: different mode of coffee maker (storage tank with warmed water to hasten coffee brewing) but it is not acceptable to have water drip through before you are ready. Everything for coffee making is manual, requiring many details before you get your brewing complete."
2,Disappointing,"I am a long time user of Bunn products. I decided to buy this unit last year and am so disappointed. It is slower in brewing than any other Bunn makers I have had. The carafe does not clip into the glass. So if you pour it too fast, even with your thumb on the ""spot"" they have on it, it dumps all over the place. I burned myself a couple of times while I was in a hurry to get to work. It also produces mold in top water chamber area. When you slide the lid to the side to pour in the water, we smell mold. And yes, I clean it and dump the grounds. This is definitely a high maintenance product. I have never had these problems with any of the other models I had. I will be more careful on the next one. I think Bunn still makes the best pot of coffee but I will never buy this model again."
5,Lita,Lita is one of my favorite divas of all time the documentry on this was a lil short an it could of had more matches but overall really good
3,"Kingfish, The Reign of Huey P. Long","As a native of Louisiana, I was very anxious to read this book. The book was very, very ""wordy"". Finishing the book was difficult, because my interest was lost in what I considered to be too many unnecessary details. Readers of this book need to keep in mind, however, that this is a history book, not a novel."
1,Fatal Error After Installation (Windows XP System),"I just purchased this today. I have already decided to return the software. After I installed Digital Studio Vers. 2 and the included software for video editing (MovieShop 6 Select), I could not start MovieShop 6 Select. I got a dialog box informing me of a ""Fatal Error"" and ""Cannot initiate. Please reinstall."" I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and it still gave me the same error message. I have Windows XP operating system and my computer exceeds the minimum system requirements for this software. All installation instructions were followed. Online technical support weren't helpful. Calling technical support (not toll-free) would require me to hold for about 25 minutes. Technical support email response time is 5 hours. I decided it's just not worth the time."
3,queen of the remakes!,"don't get me wrong this a GREAT! ""country"" album BUT! will this wannabe superstar ever sing some new material? every time a new le ann rimes album comes out it's anybodies guess as to what(or who's) song she will copy on it until she gets her own writer she should stick to country songs and stay away from the likes of"" me and bobby mcGee"" and stop trying to cross over, one song of her qwn cannot carry the album"" BIG DEAL!"""
2,Disappointment!!,"As a big fan of LeAnn's I was disappointed with this CD. Only one new song and the rest remakes that have been covered a trillion times! LeAnn sounds pretty on some of the Cline songs, but only Cline can sing Cline. Perhaps if LeAnn spent less time reading movie scripts and more time in the recording studio this CD would be better."
1,Worst album,"It just seems that with each release, LeAnn gets worse. This album sholdn't have been made, after all most of the songs are remakes and were much better done by the original artists. Go buy something else!"
5,LeAnn Rimes,"I usually review math and science books, but this is an outstanding CD. ""Crazy"" from Patsy Cline is one of the best songs of all time, and in my opinion modern singers who bring back some of the best of all time should get a medal for singing beyond the call of duty. Also, singing the best vibes makes them part of you, and if you do enough of that you can create your own new greats. As one review says, the style here is between Patsy Cline and Tammy Wynette, two of the greatest in the history of not only Country but Popular Music. There's also Hank and also very good lesser songs. My case rests content."
1,It's horrible!,"We all know that LeAnn is re-make happy, but I couldn't believe it when she came out with a WHOLE ALBUM full of them!! The re-makes are very weak. I recommend listening to the ORIGINAL singers of these songs. Because LeAnn has only been steadily declining in her voice and originality in the past year. My full recommendation: DON'T BUY IT!"
4,Heaven Burned Before,"This cd contains Germany's finest Heaven Shall Burn's first EP and bonus tracks. At the first release it had 3 more songs in addition to the EP, then they re-released it and add the demo songs. A must have for any Heaven Shall Burn fan."
2,Wayyyyyy over the top,"OK, there were some redeeming qualities in this movie but they are all in the first half before it spins out of control in two disturbing ways. I won't ruin it, maybe some will like it but when it was over, I pretty much wanted to throw up for the rest of the night."
5,Wow,"One of the best super hero movies, since, well, The Specials.The cameos, the acting, the special effects, the eggs. It's all here!"
1,Don't Be Fooled............WOW IT SUCKS,"Don't be fooled by the creative packaging, this movie looks like it might be good, even the reviews some people left are good (wow brain dead).... This movie has great actors, but is dark and stupid.... Dont waste your money."
1,Funny if you're a sociopath...,"...of if you were raised by a video-game console. At least ""Falling Down"" had a decent cast and a few good lines. This movie's script is so bad that only Ellen Page fanbois could love this film."
4,a different kind of super hero,"It seems like every other movie that is made these days is a super hero movie and I've grown tired of them. While Super is technically a super hero movie it seems different. I like that it wasn't all glossy, which i liked. Also the opening credits were really fun and one of my favorite credit sequences i've seen in a while."
1,Skip this one.,This is the most disgusting movie that I have seen in a long time. The plot is totally lame. I regret spending 99 cents to rent it.
1,You DON'T rape superheroes!,"My wife and I were looking forward to watching Super after we saw a preview for it a while back. We had forgotten about it, but later stumbled across it again and decided to rent it. I wish we hadn't. There were a few hilarious bits sprinkled throughout, including Nathan Fillion as The Holy Avenger; but too much of the movie consisted of pure shock and extremely graphic gore.SPOILER ALERTWhen his baby-faced sidekick is raping him at his house toward the end of the movie, I was half expecting him to reach for his pipe wrench, bash her face in, and shout, ""You DON'T rape superheroes!"""
5,So sweet!,I love the series. Have loved it since I read the mangas in highschool. Very cute and has a good story.
1,Haven't received it yet.,I would like to write a review for this product but I haven't received it yet. :( I've been wondering what's been taking so long?
4,i like,"juliet roberts, who first graced clubland in the early 1990s, is back after nearly a decade with a cover of donna summer's ""bad girls"". while the radio edit is such a straight, if capable, delivery of the song that one is left wondering why she bothered at all, dan's anthem and the funk force supadub offer greater variation on the theme, both vocally and musically. still, for a recrafting of the the summer hit, one would be well advised to turn to monifah's ""monifah's ""monifah's anthem (bad girl)"" from the _mo'hogany_ album. the real gem in roberts' case is the original single, ""i like"", which serves as the cover's b-side. here we find roberts in great form with an accessible and memorable dance track that is sure to make her a hit, once again, on the dancefloor."
5,Feel Great,"Was a gift , recipient says they look good,feel just right on the wrists, easy maintenanceand loves them cause she is a fan"
1,GARBAGE,I LIVE IN NEWYORK AND THERE OFFICE IS IN NEWYORK AND IT TOOK DEM 3 WEEKS TO SHIP IT.THEY SAID IT WAS IN STOCK BUT THERE A BUNCH OF LIAR THAT HAD TO ORDER IT FROM ANOTHER CITY.DONT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY THERE A BUNCH OF FRAUDS
3,"Great For Me, Bad For Everyone Else","This device works great with my phone, and makes my life easier when using the computer. But almost everyone I talk to on it says they can hear their voice echoing over the line. I don't know if the microphone is too close to the speaker or what. I wish Motorola would fix this. So if you don't mind annoying other people with it, go ahead and buy this. Its kind of like when you're talking to someone and they're on a speakerphone. You just know you're on speakerphone, it just sounds different.My only other beef with the unit is the volume doesn't get as loud as I wish it would. The volume on the phone itself (V3 Razr) is MUCH louder. If I'm in the car I sometimes have to press the headset into my ear just to hear the other person, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having a hands-free unit."
1,I feel like I just got ran over by a publicity machine,"The soundtrack was the 2nd best thing about the movie. The best thing about the movie was watching models try to walk and talk. They had a hard time at that. The people in this film need to first get acting lessons, then singing lessons. With a different cast this might have been good. But the music wasn't bad if you like lip synching."
5,A Favorite Book -- Anthropomorphic Metaphor for Structure,"This is a wonderful book. It's a perfect use of anthropomorphism (that is, a human body) being used to explain some basic mechanics and engineering. It's clever, clear, easy to understand and hugely entertaining. I gave it to my daughter when she 3 or 4 some twenty years ago. She used to beg to be read it before bedtime, in part because she would get out of bed and we would use our bodies to be compression arches, simple beams suspended between chairs, buttresses, etc, etc, sometimes to hilarious effect as ""the structure"" collapsed back onto the beds or floor. I more recently gave the book to an 8 year old boy as we toured the National Cathedral in Washington, so he could ""see"" the structure underlying the visual complexity of the structure. Again, a big hit! So by all means BUY it and buy a copy for each kid you know ... it's a small gem."
1,cheaply made & hard to set up,"This tent is hard to set up, especially by yourself. I used it four times and already the fabric near the stakes is getting ripped. Obviously a cheaply made product. I dont expect it to last many more trips to the lake. Also it wont withstand high winds. Save your money and get a good umbrella or upgrade."
2,Get what you pay for...,"After 3 days, 2 of the support poles broke. Seemed like a good deal but you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this product."
2,Dishonestly titled.,"A better title might have been, ""Chatty Neurotic Girls"". Very talky and static; not terrifically engaging, unless you like the idea of eavesdropping at a substantially atypical girls' night out. There's a fine, attractive cast (Cattrall seems to be rehearsing her character from ""Sex and the City,"" from what this cable-deprived fellow has read of that series), but (yawn) not much to do, and the situations are SO drearily melodramatic. More live nudity would have been an improvement."
5,Excellent film -- but what's the last song?,"I had the honor of meeting Live Nude Girls' director, Julianna Lavin, in early 1997 and enjoyed what she had to say about the film biz and this excellent film, full of off-the-cuff revisions, improv, as well as precisely scripted detail (such as the sound of the dump-truck dubbed in during the delivery-boy sex scene). This film is noteworthy for its unselfconscious exacting realism, incisive humor, and insightful dialog. My only question to the amazon community is this-- during the final credits, a very nice folk song plays... what is it? Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks-- buy this today!"
5,Even leaves the original lacking,"Mcgee's work on food science is seminal. Essentially everything you want to know is here. It is so greatly updated from the original that it is a different book. If there is a more complete text on the subject of science and history of food I have not seen it, or for that matter heard rumor of its existence."
1,WAY OVERPRICED JOKE,"I like the print book but not this version. E-books should be a fraction of the price of print books, not the same price. They didn't even bother to create a decent kindle edition with a linked table of contents---sad. Pass on this one until they learn their business---and lower their price."
5,Man does not live by bread alone,"He needs some inkling of how it was made. This excellent book traces the development through history of the food we eat. It shows how food's component water, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are changed by heat, pH, salinity and microbial and enzymatic activity to create the tastes and aromas familiar to us all. Every subject is traced back to its roots in recorded history, accompanied by sidebars containing historic recipes and word origins, with numerous interesting diversions along the way: How eggs are produced in the hen's body, or chocolate processed, or salt mined, or even why Pop Rocks fizz."
2,teaches only names,"McGee's book set out to teach you the science behind cooking--but ends up teaching you only the names of various compounds and reactions. Very little space is given to teaching the reader how to use food science to craft new recipes or to improve the implementation of existing recipes. Neither is any attention given to how our own kitchen experience can help us understand the nature of foodstuffs better. Also, it may be my own ignorance, but the science itself seems mostly descriptive and not analytical. While there is an appendix on chemistry--it is too little too late. Buying this book may help you impress your dinner guests with your talk, but look elsewhere for resources on how to become a better cook."
1,Terrible on Kindle2,"I have the original hard cover version of this book (I mean the one written many years ago) and have wanted this new one. While the data itself is probably terrific, it was a bad mistake to get the Kindle version. The book is just not set up for the device. Unlike other Kindle books, you cannot scroll through the table of contents and pick the chapter you'd like read and click to it. That's not a problem on most books, but on a huge reference book? Really a drag and makes it virtually useless. It was a waste of money. Get the book, sure. But not on the Kindle."
4,deep stuff,Serious information about the underpinnings of cooking. It is more the fishing rod than the fish: it will help you invent your own recipes more than merely supply instructions to follow.
5,The Science and Lore of the Kitchen,Absolutely excellent book. I just love it when I can look up this book and find out why my boiled potatoes sometimes get black marks on them ( have to put them in water at the right temperature) or why my meat is not as tender as it should be because I have not cooked it in the proper way or sliced it across the grain. The chemical analysis of cooking is fantastic. Just love it. Any cook of any calibre will want this book. It is also easily readable and even my very unscientific brain could understand the jargon.
2,Not as good as hoped for,"The reviews I saw of the book were about eggs. That section, it turns out, is excellent. But there's so much stuff missing. Tell me about sous vide, slow cookery.....lots of stuff. It was a mistake to buy the book."
1,Kindle Edition: Avoid,"I have the hard cover edition of this book. It's a terrific reference, and is in use every day in our kitchen. So I decided to purchase the Kindle edition, so that we can take the book with us to our house in Mexico.The Kindle edition does not, however, have an active table of contents. This omission, in an 800+ page reference volume, renders the book virtually useless, as one must scroll through it a page at a time, or do a word-by-word search, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. So I asked Amazon to refund my purchase price and suck it back off my Kindle, both of which they promptly did."
2,For a class,"I had to read this for a class. I wouldnt suggest it for a fun read. Very dry, I'd rather learn how to cook by doing it."
5,"""On Food and Cooking"" by Harold McGee",This book is not for the faint of heart or the casual cook or reader! This is a most complete reference work on the art and science of cooking. If you ever wondered what happens to the food stuff when you cook it or why you do or don't add certain things together while preparing a dish this volume has all your answers. This is not a bedside reader but an excellent addition to your cookbook collection and reference shelf.
1,will return it,"First of all this printer installation CD doesn't includes windows 7 or 64bit windows system andthere are lots of bug even you download driver from the Internet, doesn't work by it self you need to install virture usb port program also,I spent 1:30 hours to just this printer makes to work on windows7 64bit.After that the printer works good, but doesn't work with auto cut receipt systam and cash drawer WOW !!I waisted my 3 hours with this bad printer, Im just going to return this and will get another one.Also it doens't come with usb cable to connect to pc, you need to prepare, if you don't have it in your place"
4,Excellent!,"This album is really great! It takes a few spins to get into it, but when your there, your set! It's like they picked up where they left off."
2,Not their best '4' sure,"Where I come from STP is not so popular as in the USA. I do not know any other STP fans in here. But I am a big fan. Or...was ? I am a bit disappointed with this album. This CD brings nothing new. I don't understand why other people find this CD a classic, it doesn't come close to PURPLE (what I think is their best album). In interviews they say that 'it was so easy man' to make this album. I say it was TOO easy, because this abum is not THAT good. But...it's better than nothing. (Hopefully their next album is better.)"
3,3rd Best,"Well, I was dissapointed with this album, but it's not as bad as it could have been. I loved STP's first two albums, and was quite excited when ""Tiny..."" came out. That album really bombed. When I heard ""Down."" on the radio, I was quite excited about this album, hoping they had gone back to their heavy, non-top 40 sound. And they have, which is good, but the songs just seem uninspired, and the long choruses about heroin bring the bad part of Scott Weiland into his music. I really don't like hearing about how he is busted for heroin, and I don't want to be reminded of it when I'm listening to STP. Overall, I would say this album is worth picking up, but STP fans probably won't find this to be their favorite."
3,Striking similarities to Core with a touch of Tiny Music,"This album sounds like a B-side album from Core. It's good. But I am biased as to this is one of my favorite groups. No Way Out is the best song on this album and along with Down it should get a lot of air-play. Pruno also rocks. It will take me a while to get a good feel for the mellower tunes on this album. All in all, it sounds like the group took whatever they had unfinished from previous albums and raced to put this their last effort(?) out. Not bad."
2,Manta Ray,"Don't buy this cd. You should buy something by the Pixies. What's that.... you haven't heard the Pixies, but you think they stink? Well that just shows how shallow each and every one of you is! Isn't that right Pokey?"
2,Let down of the year...,"Goodness, what is this mediocre trash!? Is this lets make an album really quick before Weiland dies of an overdose!? It's about a notch up from the pathetic ""Tiny Music"" album. The only really good songs are ""Down"" and ""No Way Out"" which were constructed mostly by Weiland. The rest is just 'ho hum' garbage put together by the DeLeo brothers. I'm hurt almost to tears that STP hasn't done anything noteworthy since ""Core"" and ""Purple"". I'll label this one, ""LBP"": LISTEN BEFORE PURCHASE!!!!!"
4,stp never ceases to amaze me,"This fourth album, lives up to the high standard of the Stone Temple Pilots. Sonically, it's something in between ""Core"", their first album, ""Tiny music"", their third album, and ""12 bar blues"", singer Scott Weiland's recent solo effort. It's a very interesting blend. What amazes me the most is how this band reinvents itself with every album, but always remains true to it's influences. If you love the seventies, if you love grunge, if you love punk, if you love pop, but most of all, IF YOU LOVE ROCK AND ROLL, strap your seat belt and hold on tight, 'cause the pilots are going to take you for a hell of a ride..."
4,CORE MEETS TINY MUSIC SONGS!,"The first time I heard the single ""Down"", I thought to myself, this sucks! For I was expecting another huge step from the band like ""Core"" to ""Purple"" to ""Tiny Music..."" but the back step is not what I'd expect. I gave it a try by buying the album even though I only listened to one song which is the 1st single. To my surprise, the album turned out a great come-back because it showed the bands maturity and polished sound suited for its loud songs. unlike ""Core"", the sound wasn't tight enough.So what are you waiting for? Buy it!If you're wondering why I rated 4 stars only instead of 5 when I liked the album so much, the reason is as a musician/songwriter myself, I noticed Weiland's repetitive lyrics all over the album. The lyrics are good but short. He should've added more lines. Thats where the last star lies!"
3,3&1/2 stars,"Like other STP stuff, this grows on you. It's not as good as even Tiny Music, but it's good. The best songs are Down and No Way Out, the hardest rockers, but Church on Tuesday and Atlanta highlight the rset of a good album. If you hope that they'll return to the sound of Core, get over it, not gonna happen. Hell, Weiland's in prison for a year; they might not put out another record."
3,"Does not quite cut it,","Sorry,I did not think this album is up to par with any of the previous efforts. I personally think STP peaked with ""Tiny Music"" Maybe I am too hardcore. It seems most of the songs are a continuation of ""Barbarella"" Scott's solo CD. Barbarella with the exception of ""Your roof"" sucked. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan and collect everything they put out. This album did not cut it for me. To musically frayed and incohesive. Will I continue to buy STP? Hell yes, because they are prolific and write artistically masterful music. This CD however, is not of that example."
3,Inferior to Earlier Works,"Quite simply put, 'No. 4' suffers from the fact that it just isn't quite as good as the earlier albums. If it had come first, many of it's flaws could be overlooked.But it didn't, so you really can't. 'Sour Girl' and 'Down' are the highlights (and also the singles) of this probably underrated, yet flawed, work. 'No Way Out' and 'Church on Tuesday' are also solid songs. If you have a jones for STP, go with 'Purple' or 'Tiny Music' instead."
1,Broke after first use,"It says ""heavy duty,"" so I put about 10 winter sweaters on this rack to dry overnight. The next morning the rack collapsed - one of the rods on the side had snapped. My old wooden rack could handle that load, so I didn't think I was overloading it, but apparently so. I didn't send it back either because of shipping costs."
2,Not what I expected,"Wished that I invested in a butterfly type. This is not very prctical, it is hard to get to the spaces in the middle and doesn't hold much. I was expecting a little bit better product for the money."
3,pleased,When I received this item I was pleased with it---the only disappointment was that it was too small--otherwise it does the job it was meant to do--
4,Great item,"I bought this clothes drying rack because a tree fell on and destroyed my regular clothesline outdoors. I don't want to dry everything outside anymore, just a few things. This rack fits the bill perfectly. It's sturdy, very easy to assemble or take down to put away. I have not had it fall over at all, even out here in the wide open country. When I want to use it, I step out onto my deck, pull the rack out of my deck storage box, and set it up almost one-handed. Then, when I'm done with it, it is just as easily folded and placed back in the deck box for the next time. It was a little expensive, but I really needed something like this and the price is comparable to those I have seen in stores such as Lowes or Home Depot. I'm pleased with this purchase."
5,drying rack,Love this drying rack. We heat with wood and this drying rack is great for drying clothes. The wood racks would dry out and fall apart. This won't. Using this rack adds humidity to my home in the winter plus I save about $30.00 a month on my electric bill. Gret item!
1,Garbage,"Avoid this product. It cannot handle any weight at all. One of the side pieces started bending at the point where it was bolted on with the first ""load"" of laundry -- kitchen towels! Skip this junk and spend the extra money for the Honey Can Do commercial rack. Heavier duty (can easily handle eight pair of jeans) and better built. If you buy it, keep the box so you can send it back when it fails!"
4,Simple. Inexpensive. Easy to open to close. Works well. What more could you want?,I've had this unit for about 3 months now. It folds and opens quickly and easily. It fits perfectly in my bathtub so I can dry sweaters and other handwash items overnight.I would have preferred to get a wood unit for eco reasons but realized that it would probably warp quickly or slowly unless the wood was seasoned -- which is unlikely if the unit is inexpensive. This chrome unit shows no sign of wear or rust.I'm happy with it.
1,errors made it difficult to read,Contents were interesting enough but constant insertion/omission of words and sometimes grammatical errors made it very hard to concentrate on contents. Don't publishers proof read anymore?
5,He will come again in glory,"This sequel is also interesting. The writer is a Catholic, and has views which are different than many other writers of this genre. This book answers the question ""why is Christ coming back to Earth,"" and many others. A must read! Not as easy reading as his first book, but if you read the first book you can easily understand the second."
2,Shoddy Construction,"The bin came without some of the pieces, but even the pieces that came were flimsy and did not hold together well. The casters at the bottom do not role well. I'll see how this holds up, but I am not optimistic."
5,Triple Bin Sorter,I am using this bin in our health club to house some small balls. It's very durable and easy to move from room to room because of the wheels. I am very satisfied with this purchase!
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I have a small house, only 2 people so laundry doesn't add up like in some homes. But the small house sure makes it look like it adds up. This isn't as small as I was imagining but perfect for what I need. It is strudy and rolls around very easily. I wasn't sure if it was worth the 50 bucks but I haven't found anything that doesn't fall apart so this is great. The canvas bags are pretty heavy duty and will last a very long time. Overall I am enjoying very much and have had for a few weeks now."
5,Great sturdy product,Purchased this product a few months ago and I'm very happy with the quality. Mesh bins are very sturdy and roomy to hold alot of clothes. I have both rolled the entire system and taken each bin off the metal frame to do laundry. Very easy to reattach the bins to the frame. Would highly recommend.
4,"Wheel fell off within a few months, nice heavy duty bags",One of the wheels feel off of this but we just duct taped it. Used it while living in an apartment complex in san francisco where we had to take our laundry to the basement to shared machines. They're pretty huge so it's easy to wait too long to do laundry :) I no longer use the wheel/base and just use the three bags to carry laundry down to our current basement laundry machines (no elevators anymore). I'd recommend this product just for the 3 bags.
4,Love 'em,"I ordered two of these bin sorters, one for me and one for my fiance. We like to have out laundry pre-sorted and theses bins give us the opportunity to do so. We don't have a washer and dryer at our house yet so we take laundry to our parents houses and it is nice to either take the whole unit or take the bags off throw them into the back of the vehicle and go. The frame work seems sturdy enough and with the shelf on the lower half, my mind is at ease of the bags getting to full and falling. The only problem I have noticed with them is that the fiance apparently finds the velcro complicated, because he has yet to be able to get the bags back on the frame!!!! Perhaps it is more of a problem with the fiance than the bin!!"
3,Lacks in Production,"This album was a weak testament of the true genius of Baby Beesh and Jay-T. The first thing that you'll notice is that there are no catchy tunes or lyrics. Most of the album has the same electronica beat from beginning to end. The only song that is worth while to listen is ""Raza Park"" and that is because the beat is a little slower and is more of a cruizin' song. The lyrics are better than the beats, but were not too well thought up. Another big thing was that it lacked a lot of spanish verses, and this group is suppose to represent Latinos. Overall I don't highly reccomend this album."
5,does the job,"I bought this set to do just one job where shorter hex sockets wouldnt go. It has since done a whole bunch of other jobs and is holding up well. Remember its $14 so dont expect snap on quality, it will handle 50 ftlbs but that may be pushing it. The storage case is very useful."
3,Need more info,"Like so many online listings today, important information is not to be found. As in this product, no info in the description as to what the sizes are, just that they are metric."
3,a pharmacy tech's little helper,i feel the 3rd edition to this book is the best it gives plenty of examples and shows you how to conquer the math which is oh so important in the pharmacy field.
5,A Great Dog Story,"I saw Red Dog on a flight in Australia last summer. Wanted the DVD, but was disappointed that it wasn't available in the USA. Was delighted when it finally came out. Make sure there's a box of tissues handy when watching."
4,Great for kids,My 11 years old daughter loves animals and this was a great story and movie. I would recommend this movie to a friend for sure
5,I LOVE RED DOG!,JUST FINISHED WATCHING RED DOG ON NETFLIX. I CAN'T WAIT TIL THE PRICE COMES DOWN SO I CAN BUY IT. THIS MOVIE IS SO WONDERFUL AND I JUST KNEW THERE WOULD BE A TEAR JERKER MOMENT! I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A TRUE STORY BEFORE I STARTED WATCHING IT. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO EVERYONE. EXCELLENT! DOGGERS ROCK!
1,same problem as sammy,"purchased this produce and it made one season, the unit sits on the base of the plow and takes a beating with the snow and dirt, my unit popped the thermal and does not work,"
1,Need Lower Rating Scale for this one.,"Not sure what O'Reilly had in mind in publishing this book. You can get pretty much the same information from organizations like CERT for FREE. If meant for management, it still missed the mark since in many cases management is still trying to learn how to spell S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y. A concept like IR is way over their heads and out of the question. With shrinking budgets people are looking for solutions not another obtuse layer of complexity. Glad to see the price drop - still too much for what you get."
3,Nothing we don't know now,"Perhaps in the immediate aftermath of September 11, this was a book that was a shock to those who read it, but 5 1/2 years on it's all nothing new.In fact, the book has the feel of being hurridly thrown together at times, which is perhaps why it never seems to hold a consistant argument. And while it does raise some valid points about US foreign policy that could be built upon, Parenti instead often goes of on tangents that seem more like small rants."
3,is a cheap set but works ok,"if you consider a cheap option for your queen bed, this could be a nice one but if you want something more long lasting try other brabd"
4,Plan to read the entire series!,"I was skeptical at first, but as I started to read this story it hooked me. I like the characters, I like the it is an urban setting and especially the action. I look forward to reading the entire series."
4,Slow Start...but picks up...,"This book by L.A. Banks had a slow start and loses the reader at the beginning. I almost put it down and put it in the ""read at another time when there's nothing else to read"" category. But, I'm glad I didn't. Midway through this book it picks up and becomes a ""Don't put down until you reach the end"" book. In L.A. Banks defense, this is the first book in this series, so a lot of ground work had to be laid before she could get into the meat. The narrative to the book is pretty much ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes to the hood"". However, her delivery had a real street feel that relates more to readers than the 90210 vampire version that Buffy presents. I like this book and took away one star for the very slow build up, but recommend it for vampire novel enthusiast."
1,Horrible,"This book was so bad that I couldn't get past the first couple of pages. I tried to give it a shot, but the writing is terrible. I can see where the ideas of the book are wondeful, and even though there are blatant rips off from different vampire myths, this book should be good. It isn't. Within four pages of reading the book, I wanted to put myself out of my misery. It's a great idea to have a more ethnic version of vampire stories, but this one sucks. Sorry."
1,"lackluster, blah","I just could not get into this book, it was very boring. The characters just did not bond with each other nor me.I'll pass on the rest of the series."
1,This book sucked,"This book had so much promise but failed so miserably. Very slow paced with way too much lagging detail and dialogue. The hip-hop ""slang"" was really annoying and really distracts from the reading. The author uses every sad vampire cliche there is and throws them into the story for no reason. Nothing really exciting happens just build up to something so huge happening and then nothing happens. Boring and frustrating couldn't wait til it was over."
2,Skipped Sections Just So It Would End,"I read the book over a year ago and in my search for a good paranormal book recently, I came across the title and figured I should write a review. The thing the bothered me most was how the characters repeated the same thing over and over and over and over. At first, I didn't mind the slang, but it ended up making it seem as though there was only one characther speaking through the entire story. The characters lacked any indivduality or personality. They all sounded the same and with pages of repetition, it became more of a labor than pleasure to read. I ended up skipping huge sections just so the ride would be over. I want to give other titles a chance, but at this point I may just stick to reading the summaries than muddle through another book."
3,Boring in the beginning.,"This was a slow book at the start, but picked up towards the end. Halfway through the book I decided that I didn't want to read the next one, but as I got closer to the end and the characters finally started to emerge into people that you wanted to know more about, I changed my mind. I think that if you do get this book be sure to buy book 2, ""The Awakening"" at the same time because that is where the actual story line begins."
1,couldn't read it,I was terribly disappointed in this book. I couldn't read it due to the very poor writing style. The back cover was about the only thing that was understandable. Glad that I only bought the first book.
1,I really wanted to love it but....,"Im a big fan of Anita Blake, Suny, and many other popular paranormal fiction writers. In fact, I like any author who can help me escape my sometimes hectic life for a while. In anticipation of a two-week break I ordered several Banks' books to entertain myself....what a mistake.I really want to get sucked up into a new world, which I think could happen with this premise but the writing is awful. The part that continues to turn me off is the extended so-called dialog which is just people lecturing at each other to fill in the back story. There has got to be a better way to get the background out there.The premise is great but the style is extrememly annoying. REAL PEOPLE DON'T TALK THAT WAY!!! Im giving my stack of Banks books andto Goodwill trying some new authors...."
3,okay....,"the cover pulled me and the character sealed the deal. a black female vampire hunter...too cool !but i put the book down after the first few pages.the first chapters drove me nuts with aimless dialogue filled with slang and unlovely prose. and i HATE a lot of slang when i am reading for pleasure--- i dont know why, I JUST DO! i only like slang in my music!anyway, i was able to come back to the book a few weeks later and finish it.it was just fine when i skipped over some of the more odious slang passages.and the plot was getting JUICY before i was hit with the cliffhanger-sooooo...if the author could get rid of most the slang and throw in even more african tinged occult lore...DAMALI just might be a match for buffy...and a close runner up to anita blake."
1,Not so Hot,I am not sorry but this book is no where as good as the Anita Blake books or Meredith Gentry. L.A. Banks does not come within a mile of expressing herself/hisself half as good as Laurell K Hamilton. You would be better off waiting for the next and next and next of Laurell K Hamilton than waste good reading time with this book.
3,Not interesting at first,"I was in the book store one day and was browsing for something different to read. I came across Minion and figured it would exactly what i was looking for. When i began the book, i have to say, i was somewhat bored with Banks ""wordiness"" being that the characters had so much to say and yet absoultely nothing was happening. Actually, i found the first 30-40 pages of the book to be quite a chore to read as it was boring. However, after those pages, the book becomes quite interesting as a plot unfolds and grabs the readers attention. It is like that throughout the rest of the book. Surely after reading this, you will want to know what else is going to happen within the series."
4,Vassilis Tsitsanis first song,Very imported to those who interest in V. Tsitanis work.This CD contains his first songs.
1,Not good,"I stuck with this book against my better judgment because I expected it to get better. It didn't. It was just dull, dull, dull. The main character, 17 year-old Viva, is quirky, but not in a good way. The book seemed like it should be interesting based on the strange cast of characters in Viva's life, but nothing ever happened! I didn't like the author's writing style, either. I found it annoying. Even though she's only 17 years old, I found myself wishing Viva would just have sex already and get it over with, since the author kept teasing us with the possibility of sex. Just a very disappointing read. Save your time for better stuff, like any of Rachel Gibson's books or Bridget Jones's Diary if you've never read that."
1,Unbelievably bad,This is an utterly unbelievable book -- the writing fails to capture anything like a real human emotion and the plot is entirely preposterous. It reads like a teenager's fantasy about hanging out with rock stars and betrays not a whit of insight or real knowledge of how the world works. That is crucial to these kinds of books -- i.e. the idea that you're getting a little peek into something fun and glamorous. It's just awful.
4,Feline Funhouse,"Nice secure space for kitty, although smaller than I thought it would be. Could be better constructed, as mesh separated in one spot after just the first use. Opens up quickly and easily, but it is impossible for me to figure out how to close it again so it fits into the bag, the instructions don't make sense. Overall a nice item."
3,takes patience,"I love the tent.. but . it does take some patience with introducing it to the cats. we put it up in the living room to let the 4 cats get used to, but what it did was create an issue with territory... i had to take it down to avoid fighting. now i have to try and introduce the cats to the tent one at a time while they are outside. but it'll have to wait til it's warmer."
5,My View And Lucy's View...,I can say that I love this kitty tent...my lovable spoiled inside only Tonkinese cat can come out on the deck with us free from flying insects and secure in her kitty tent...Lucy's view is that it is a torture chamber for her...she is still adjusting to it but in time will learn to appreciate its safety.
3,Not for the elderly always indoor cat,"My cat leads a sheltered life and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect to get her outside but still be protected. She was fine with it until the neighbor animals came to visit and then she freaked. It was used for a total of less than a half hour and, after almost two weeks of practically continual hissing and screeching, I'm not going to try to get her back into it."
1,Good for Nothing,"This meter looked promising, especially with the thermocouple input and large display. There is only one problem; it over-reads all values up to a factor of nearly double. I was about to return a 24VDC power supply I had just purchased because it was reading 40 VDC. Then I got suspicious and checked other things with the meter. The wall outlet read 190 VAC, a AAA battery read 2.5 VDC, and my computer power supply 12V line read 16 VDC. The resistance feature often reads negative values and the sound does not work on the continuity feature, even though the sound symbol is displayed. Multiple battery changes didn't help. I can't vouch for the amperage readings but honestly don't care, the rest of the unit has proven itself. My $4 Harbor Freight pocket multimeter read within 5% so why can't this heap? I confirmed all the above with a benchtop multimeter as well. Save your money and literally get something cheaper that out performs this and don't waste your time."
3,Why so much $$$?,"I love Kodak, and was saddened by the recent financial trouble the company has recently been going through. I hope they survive. But I can't help but wonder why so much for batteries that the popular brand-name competitors charge half the price that Kodak charges for theirs? These have the same power rating and quality as Kodak's."
1,Disappointed,"When I saw this product offered at Amazon.com in August 2010, there was no product information with it and no photo, so I called Amazon to see if this was in fact the 1975 DVD of the Rocky Mountain Christmas TV special. Amazon confirmed (after some research) that it was. However, today I see this is just another Fireplace DVD with Rocky Mountain Christmas music as a background. I have shopped Amazon for years and have always been pleased with their products and service; however, I am very disappointed with this experience."
4,Good but....,"Its a good album but the new songs from Cypress Hill are already on The Alchemists 1st Infantry cd but they are still good none the less. It has a nice mix of songs but the only frustrating thing is the constant ""you're listening to the soul assassins"" vocal which is a bit of a bummer. Its like what radio stations do to stop people recording perfect songs from the station. Apart from this the cd is well worth a listen. Typical Muggs hard beats"
5,Excellent Knitting Reference!,This book is easy to read and has many wonderful patterns. Perfect for a beginner or an experienced knitter!
3,A Little Disappointed,"I am an avid knitter, actually instruct several knitting classes. I expected a more varied array of patterns, also more varied in difficulty.I thought the colored pictures were good, but in general I expected more."
3,Quality of camera pictures,"Hey alli am thinking of buying a phone with camera and so i looked at this one. the only thing i am concern on this camera phone is the clarity of the picture. i know its not a Digital camera but still when i c samsung 205 or Mot 300, the quality of picture is much better of those then Samsung E715. even sprint a600 has good quality pictures.I know for most of us picture quality of camera is not as important as having a camera but for me it makes a difference.can somebody help me on deciding the phone.Thanks for ur help."
1,Poor performance / bad reception,"This phone has lots of bells & whistles, but lacks the most essential feature needed in a cell phone: clear reception. Callers can not hear me despite many signal bars. This is not reflective of the network, because if my SIM card is used in another phone, reception is crystal clear. I returned the first E715 due to this problem, and the second one is equally poor. Also, if talking for a long period of time, this phone spontaneously disconnects. I would NOT recommend it to anyone!"
3,Good phone but with some annoying flaws,"The phone has a good and intuitive user interface, and lots of cool features. One of the features that drew me to it was the front LCD panel. Unfortunately, when taking pictures using the front LCD the images are mirrored. T-Mobile told me to suck it up. Another flaw is that if the time format is changed to 24h instead of 12h the setting will be reset if the phone is turned off. The third, and most annoying flaw, is that some WAP sites apparently cause the phone to restart. Except for these flaws, though, it is a lovely phone, and I would recommend it, even for other former die-hard Nokia fans."
2,Worked fine (for a while....),"Well, just as all the other reviews state....it's a really cool lookin phone, has some nice features...BUT - it's got it's bugs too. For the price, i'd stay away from it.Though I haven't had any problems with T-Mobile - i have with this phone. I'm going on 10 months with it and the screen (like the others state) is starting to bleach out on me. Fine lines are appearing across the screen and yes, it's starting to reboot on me for no apparent reason.Also, i haven't read this on anyone else's review - but my phone looses phone numbers out of my phonebook every so often. They just get deleted. I'll go look for my buddy Curt - and his name and number are gone. weird...this happens probably about once every couple weeks...the camera on the phone is subpar too...read reviews on it - you'll see...in dark light...the pics are red...again - weird.So, i dunno..i was happy with it the first month...but after a while...it's lame...cool looking, but lame."
2,i have had it!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh boy, I hate this phone today. I have had my phone almost 2yrs, first year was just fine. After that my phone wouldn't stay charged for very long and reception got worse, also the screen started to fade. So first I got an internal antenna, it didn't help. So I went to a t-mobile store to get a new battery, the sales person told me they didn't have any for my phone in stock and told me to buy one from another company online that they were just as good. I did, holds charge even less time then the old one. Well this morning, for the second time my phone turned itself off while charging and dumped all my wallpapers, ALL, I don't even have the ones that came with the phone, I have a white screen. It also dumped all my purchased ringtones. And now after charging all last night my phone is dead, it died around 2:00pm. So my advice is: works great for a year, trade it in for an upgrade when your new year starts."
3,"Good phone, mediocre battery life","Phone works okay - battery life is about the same as the 4 year old Startac I had until I replaced it with this phone - which means you'll get 2-3 days at best with moderate use. The display is ridiculously bright and must consume a heck of a lot of power - too bad there is no brightness setting. Camera quality is excellent for a phone, flash is pretty much useless (nice selling point, but only bright enough for pictures <12 inches from camera)."
3,Great phone..but,"I would like to join to those who liked the Samsung E715. I only want to point out a few problems.1) The Calendar is a rudimentary, VERY poorly designed part of the system. Motorola is waaaay better. Can you imagine that it only takes about 20-25 entries before it is ""FULL""? No automatic deletion of old data.2). Yes, it has an infrared port but what is to connect to? My XP computer has no problem recognizing the phone, however, no software can communicate with it, including Samsung's own ""Easy GPRS""3) The battery life is scary short. Make sure you recharge it every day.Otherwise it is a good phone. I like it. Three start only because one expects more for so much money.Akos"
3,Reception is not as good as Samsung GSM is known for,"Bought this phone when it came out and returned it three days later....In areas where my Samsung S105 would just cut out this phone DROPPEDGuess the internal antenna was a bad move for Samsung...Also, the camera flash was nothing more than a flashlight... haha and the camera quality was a novelty too...Other than that it was a cool little phone but NO WAY was it worth over $100.00"
1,Don't buy Samsung E715,"The reasons are:1. The screen display becomes complete while after 6 to 8 months of use and you can't see any thing on the screen after that.2. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10-15 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge.3. The only good thing abount it is just the look and you can enjoy it for 6 months are so and later you have to junk it as display goes off!"
3,umm,"Pros:Stylish (looks better than other brands')crystal clear screen + colors good (samsung is known for the LCD monitor, they are #1 in market)camera is good. zoom and flash light features are coolplenty space for everything. games,ringtones, pictures, sms, phonebook..etclarge ext. lcd.Cons:BatterylifeI would give this phone 4stars if the battery life was good.(...)"
2,"Two phones, same problem","I bought two E715 from amazon around 10 months ago. Now both of them have the same problem: the display screens are fading. one totally white out and another one is Ok but some horizontal fade lines are coming up.I will send the white-out one back for repairing. If the second one dies, I will buy new phones but will not be Samsung.So many hassles if you want to send them back."
5,good~!,This book my friend introduce this book to me~ really good! I plan to read it at this winter break!
3,Depends what you are looking for...,"This book was thoroughly enjoyable to read, but had very little advice on actual editing. It is very worth reading, if for nothing else, to hear the author's words (he is a god of editing). Nevertheless, I really wanted more on his ideas behind making cuts instead of abstract thoughts. His three pearls are: 1) Stand up when editing, 2) When a person blinks it is because they got the concept and are making a ""mental cut"", and that we are going to move into a time of digital editing, but must remember our past. There... I saved you the 10 dollars. Buy it to enjoy it, but don't expect it to teach more than I just revealed..."
2,cheap,Cute idea but Rubys look cheap. I returned this becuase I was embarassed to give it to the couple. Look carefully at the picture before deciding.
2,I did not recieve a helmet headset!,"This is a pendant headset. It says it can be converted, but unfortunately it does not come with the boom mike or helmet mount. I will try it out, the only other issue I noticed is that the device can be used as an intercom, but requires the user to flip a very small switch."
4,Does the job,"If I had paid more than $22 for this reconditioned jigsaw, I probably would have been a little disappointed. As the other reviewer noted, there is no laser -- not sure where that idea came from. (That's okay -- we don't need no stinking laser.) The orbital function does not work either. The blade simply moves straight up and down in both positions (""fast cut"" and ""smooth cut""). It should also be noted that you can cut at a 45-degree(ish) angle, but you have to first remove the foot (which you can do without tools) and reconnect it to the bottom of the saw at the desired angle. (It only makes 90 and 45-degree cuts.)These kinks aside, I needed something that cuts straight and kicks up less dust than a circular saw, and this qualifies on both counts. Again, I paid $22, and got what I paid for with no regrets."
2,lost the Magic,"Unlike thier 1999 release'Got the Magic', 'Original Cinema' lacks the snap and the beat that charactorizes the Spyro Gyra style. 'Original Cinema' is departure in a different direction. They need to return to their 'style' rather than create a sound without definition."
2,Informative But Not Entertaining,"To sum it up - I learned a lot from the book but didn't enjoy reading it.This is the first book I've read about the Peloponnesian War and I certainly learned a lot about how it was fought. You will get a clear understanding of why Athens lost the war. However, I didn't enjoy that it was written as an analysis rather than a flowing narrative. Certain sections of the book, primarily about the siege of Syracuse flow well, but I found most of it dry. It also seems repetitive within the chapters themselves and the lack of narrative flow made it hard to keep my attention.I did appreciate the fact that he didn't introduce 100 characters who I was supposed to remember as do many ancient histories. I recommend this book only to the most ardent ancient history fan."
3,Hard to Follow,"This book breaks the Peloponnesian War into its component parts and discusses how each influenced the strategy of the two sides. The author seems to presuppose a working knowledge of the conflict on the part of the reader. Because this was my first effort at educating myself about the war I found Hanson's explanations hard to follow. ""A War Like no Other"" is not for beginners. Prior to tackling this book I would suggest first reading Thucydides and some other more basic text about the complicated conflict between Athens and Sparta."
5,A very good insight,"This book provides a fresh a deep insight of the Peloponesian War. It is the ideal complementary reading of the Thucydides' Peloponesian War. The Hanson's work is a very good contribution to the undestanding of that War, with useful lessons learned even to the current international scenario."
4,Hanson does it again,"If like me you have read previous books on Greek history by Victor Davis Hanson you will know what to expect. This has all the usual Hanson fingerprints - lively but prolix, at times repetitive, with one or two stylistic quirks (in this book Hanson seems to be fixated on the word ""calculus""), and a somewhat irritating tendency to draw parallels with more modern events. Yet he can be a compelling writer and this after all is a compelling story.For a detailed chronicle of the Peloponnesian War go to Donald Kagan's authoritative three-volume work which I recommend highly. For an interesting and very evocative discussion of key themes in the war, Hanson's ""A War Like No Other"" is well worth your attention."
1,Bhutan Land Of The Thunder Dragon,"Do yourself a favor and do not order this DVD. The content may be worthwhile, but getting this DVD format to play on any DVD player or computer is an exercise in futility. Very frustrating."
4,Does the job,"It does the job but because it is silicon, it doesn't do it as well as a hair brush. The upside is you can pop this thing this the dishwasher and clean it well. I use this to brush on oil on baking dishes and brush marinate on meat."
5,Love this!,"I love this silicone pastry brush over the bristle hair pastry brush I've been using all my life. No more stray hairs in my food or pastries! It's MUCH easier to wash, even after letting butter ""dry"" on the silicone bristles."
2,no good pastry brush,This brush does not spread anything. A small paint brush works much better. I do not recommend buying this brush.
4,So far,"So far so good. I needed a pastry/all purpose brush in a hurry for a recipe and our old one was beyond salvaging. Amazon delivered fast and so far, it has held up to multiple uses and dishwashings with no problem. I like the ""holey"" insert that seems to hold the butter and egg wash from prep bowl to the pre-baked item with little drips. A nice bonus."
1,not useful!,"I am extemely dissatisfied with this book. It is as though the author cannot decide if the intended audience is already familliar with developing forms applications in the developer 2000 environment. Consequently, it gives too little information for both the new and experienced users. The information it does present is repetative and poorly organized. If you buy this book, and go through it chapter by chapter, you will have an idea of what can be done with Developer 2000 forms, but no idea of how to do it! Don't buy this book."
2,For principiants,"Only for people wants to learn Oracle Forms, not for people knows Oracle Forms. IIf you want to learning Forms this book is for you, otherside don't expend your money."
2,Fell apart in the first hour my dog played with it.,"Some of the reviews I read were misleading. Maybe some of these people's dogs don't like to chew things, but after only an hour, this toy was in shreds thanks to my playful Border Collie. Could be that he gets obsessed with things very easily and won't stop playing with something unless it's taken away from him. Probably a good toy for some, but this didn't work out for me. I was left picking up the peices and inner fuzz several days later. I would not recommend this toy for someone who's dog has ocd."
2,Not real crazy about the durability of this toy,"I thought it was the cutest thing ever, but I gave it to a friend for her dogs, and she told me just yesterday that it came apart after only a few times of the dogs playing with it. I suppose it would work for a little dog, but given the size of the toy, I would expect it to hold up a little longer than that for a bigger dog. If it's only supposed to be given to a dog that just carries it around, then it should say so in the description. I still think it's really cute, and my Bichon and Maltese might do ok with it. But since it's big enough for a big dog toy, I think I'll pass."
5,My dog loves it.,"For some reason one of my dogs can't go anywhere without his penguin. To avoid dealing with super disgusting penguins, I was looking to get some back ups. I had no luck at the local pet stores. Luckily, I found them online at an amazing price. They arrived brand new and now I have the peace of mind that my pup will always be paw deep in penguins. The xl size is perfect for my 50 pound shepherd husky mix. Its a very durable toy and makes a grunt noise versus a squeak so it is far less annoying that other toys."
2,Okay for small dogs.....,"but my boy had it in shreds almost immediately. A cute toy, but definitely not worth what I paid for it."
2,Destined for the toy graveyard,"Our husky shredded this toy easily within a couple of days and we had to take it away from her. Alas, it does not hold up to hard chewers as well as some other stuffed animal toys. The belly is intact, but once the neck, arms, and legs start to unravel, the stuffing falls out. Perhaps this toy would be more durable with less aggressive chewers."
3,"Somewhat stale, though excellently performed material","While I was really disapointed with the previous DT cd ('Falling Into Infinity'), at least it was an attempt by the band to try something new. Here, we get basically re-hashed riffs seemingly leftover from the first two albums. I was looking forward to this release because I thought that Jordan Rudess could provide a fresh, positive, profound influence on their sound. Boy was I wrong ! His talent is pretty much wasted and relegated to a minor supporting role. And why does James LaBrie sound so self-concious ? Seems like he's trying to sing like a non-trained singer (where did that passionate, resonant vibrato dissapear to ?). Seems that DT might never be able to duplicate 'Images And Words' and 'Awake', so why even try ? Let's see if these guys can mature as a band and not get stuck repeating themselves like so many other bands in this genre. DT were true innovators in the early 90's, now let's see them live up to those expectations !"
4,Great Album from front to back!,"Dream Theater never ceases to amaze me. And with this one they just solidified the fact that they are the best prog. Metal band in history. Especially since's its a concept album, which is can get very hard at times trying to stay on subject and let the music back up the story.The band works very well together and everyone has their time to shine. The concept is very intruiging and flows very well. The only two reasons i didn't give it 5 stars is that there were too many slow songs, and it seemed a little short to me. A couple one or two minute songs. But all in all it was an awesome album. Definately worth the money. If you truly are a fan of dream theater, get this album and earn the right to call yourself one."
3,Scenes From A Memory: Technical Self-Indulgence,"Dream Theater only partially succeeds with Scenes From A Memory. This is more technical metal than progressive metal. The two are not the same but somehow have become warped and twisted into one genre. This isn't Dream Theater's fault, they are likely making the kind of music they want. But if you are looking for songs instead of ""musical masturbation"", look elswhere. Admittedly, the songs that are present on Scenes are very good but there are not very many of them.I was hoping for progressive metal with this album. Instead, I hear technical metal with some progressive music scattered here and there.If you're looking for true progressive metal, go pick up an album by Eternity X. True progressive metal cannot be found on Scenes From A Memory, no matter what Dream Theater's arrogant fans belive."
2,Nice Try - but,"Well, this is quite a disappointing attempt at a concept album for Dream Theater. While the musicanship is, as always, excellent, none of the songs can really stand on their own. The story line is really too simplistic. There is a little twist at the end but not too much else happens. I've seen this compared to Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime (the only concept album I actually like) but it doesn't even come close as far as the story line goes. Dream Theater should probably stick to single song albums such as Awake until they can write a decent story."
5,Astounding masterpiece!,"Dream Theater has long been one of my favorite bands, and of all their albums this is the one I come back to the most. Petrucci, Rudess, Myung, Labrie, and Portnoy astound me. The fantastic music on this album is topped off by an intriguing story line and petruccis head-ripping solos. The quieter songs on the album are just as powerful, with great lyrics and superb arrangement. This is probably my favorite album of all time, and a must for any metal/prog fans collection. Can't wait for the Radio City dvd!!"
2,Talented? Yes...One Dimensional? Yes...,"I am well aware of the reputation that preceeds this group of musicians. They are fine craftsmen, no doubt about it. But a band cannot survive on talent alone. Metallica and Megadeth continue to possess enormous amounts of talent, yet their creative and spiritual well has run dry. The same holds true for DT. Their ""storyline"" has potential yet lacks imagination. Their music has flashes of brilliance yet lacks emotion or signs of humanity. It comes off as rather cold and robotic...autopilot-like almost. It's certainly not for a lack of trying...in fact, DT tries a bit too hard in convincing the listener of the enormity of it all. Should a ""metal"" album really sound this good? I hear this album and am reminded of hair bands of the 80's...who were slickly produced, talented and proud of themselves. And what did it all amount to artistically? Need I go on?"
1,Nope,"Over 30 years ago ELP gave us TARKUS with its themes within themes,progressive thinking and melodic content.You'd think that 30 years later with all the schooling and miryad info available to musicians today these technically adept guys would be able to come up with something better than this childish drivel,buy another copy of Dark Side Of The Moon instead."
1,Get Real,"I am having a difficult time understanding what the terms ""progressive,"" ""experimental,"" or ""conceptual"" are supposed to mean regarding the rock music I am hearing from this band. It seems to me a front--a rather [sad] excuse for letting the lyrics be ridiculous, the soloing obnoxious, and the form of each song ultimately uninteresting, collapsing under the weight of the pretentious ""big meaning"" behind it all.Whatever these guys are trying to convey with ""Scenes from a Memory"" does not cover up for the fact that they are nothing more than show-offs, hopping and skipping around their instruments as if necessary burdens in their incredible and profound artistic endeavors. While there is an idea apparent in this recording, it is not even in the same league with an album like Radiohead's ""OK Computer"" or Bjork's ""Homogenic.""Dream Theater needs to freshen up on the work of their contemporaries before they continue labeling their music ""progressive."""
5,A true masterpiece from a legendary band in their prime.,"For those of us that have experianced DREAM THEATER, we have been lucky enough to be a part of a rare musical dream. SCENES FROM A MEMORY is the highlight of that dream so far. A true masterpiece from a legendary band in their prime. To have a band that has five virtuoso rock musicians in one band is very rare. And for them to create incredible music that will hold up for generations is almost unheard of. I know that this is debatible, but I believe the only other band that can make this claim is LED ZEPPILIN. SCENES FROM A MEMORY is one of the greatest rock albums ever created. It is flawless. The production is excellent. The musicianship is incredible. And the lyrics(or story) are perfect. Let's all hope that DREAM THEATER is around for another twenty years. If you are new to DREAM THEATER, be warned. Once you hear them, you'll be spoiled forever."
5,The Best of Prog Rock,"When Dream Theater started, they could play really well, but their music just didn't have the composure an appeal that it needed to make it in the music world. With 10 years and five studio albums behind them, they are (to me at least) the best band out there today. It is sad that they aren't more widely known (in America, that is). This band is comprised of five of the most talented musicians that have ever lived, and they can do nothing but make great music. After their previous album (""Falling into Infinity""), I had high hopes for Dream Theaters next album, and it certainly fulfilled those hopes. I believe this is the best concept album of all time, except maybe for Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"". The story is excellent, the music is fantastic, and the singing is powerful. Nothing about this album is bad. This is my favorite album. Every time you listen to it, you hear something you didn't hear before. No other album has ever been like that to me. Buy this album"
4,Natural next steps...,"My humble opinion: Dream Theater is made up of five of the most talented musicians in the progressive rock field. The addition of Jordan Rudess on keyboards is just natural synergy. Listen to The Dance of Eternity for proof. This cut in particular takes my breath away. Scenes is a compositional tour de force, the culmination of the band's eleven year growth through past works ranging from uneven to astounding. Lyrically, the band's tone has ranged from cathartic to socially caustic. Scenes travels an operatic story-line, fraught with passion, betrayal and tragedy which makes repeated listening difficult if not in the proper frame of mind. In future ventures, topics of growth and hope might be a nice balance for their powerful music."
5,DT are progressive gods!!,"Dream Theater is one of the best progressive metal bands out there. John Petrucci is a guitar god along with Zakk Wylde, Dimebag Darrell, Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, James Murphy, Kirk Hammett, Alex Skolnick, and Andreas Kisser. To the idiot who said Avril Lavigne is better than Petrucci, none other than that Avril Lavigne #1Fan, get a life you crackhead. That trendy bitch can't even play guitar worth a (censored). Man I bet you smoke too much crack than that other idiot who was talkin (censored) about all the great real metal bands. Avril sucks, Dream Theater rules. BTW Lay off the drugs and shut up losers!!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been a fan of DT since ""Images and Words"", and none of their past albums (which are all spectacular mind you) have blown me away like this one. The musicianship is the greatest I have ever heard, the plot (it is an opera) is intriguing, and the sound quality will test the limits of the greatest stereos. By far the best album I have heard this year. After a few more spins in the player, it may be the best EVER!"
2,Good muzak.,"Whatever happened to Emerson,Lake and Palmer?Maybe I'm getting too old for this,but when a friend of mine presented me with a copy of what he called 'a masterpiece'I felt compelled to write this:MUSIC DOES NOT EQUAL MUZAK !"
4,Early Nationalist-Romantic Work by Great Artist,Assia Djebar's third novel is a transition to a work that served the Algerian nationalist cause but retained her romantic tone. The Afterward by Clarisse Zimra including interview with Djebar is invaluable.Ruth Roded
5,Katherine's Very Best!,"This is the best Katherine Kingsley I've ever read. I didn't want it to end. Beautiful job, Lady K!Diana Rubino, author of I LOVE YOU BECAUSE, ..."
2,Ugh!,"Not a great book. Some funny moments but too much of a departure from her other books. And really, a Christmas ghost?"
1,Disappointing,"This is a beautiful book, but the coverage is overwhelmingly for geometric oriental rugs, with a large section added for Chinese. I was looking for the more ornate styles (Heriz, Tabriz, Sultanabad, and so on) that are so very beautiful. These are grossly underrepresented in this book, if at all (e.g., most are not). I am sorry I purchased the book."
3,A good start,"This book is a good introduction to rug basics, with rich illustration and good coverage of the main carpet-producing regions in Asia and the Middle-East. However, the book leaves much to be desired as a genuine tool to help one actually collect rugs. It gives out basic information in a general lecture-like fashion (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but does not really make an effort at reaching out to the reader in terms of the actual experience of buying/handling/trading carpets (which is definitely a bad thing). One glaring weakness is the paucity of information on Central Asian rugs outside of Turkmenistan (arguably because the book was written at a time when Central Asia was not as easily accessible as it is now). There is also, it must be said, a somewhat superior tone to the writing that is not necessary and does take away from the pleasure of reading on the subject. Still, all things considered, this is a valuable book to own."
2,WOW! More generic MTV metal to waste your time/money!,"I will say it right now: There's a huge audience for this kind of music, and saliva will no doubt become more and more successful and get more radio play... but come on people. Seriously, this is sad... it's the same MTV .... thats been released for the last few years over and over, I've listened to 'Every Sixty Seconds' and 'Back Into Your System' a few times through, and it's luaghable how poppy and contrived this is. I'll give it 2 stars becuase it's not PAINFUL to listen to, it's just boring and the same old .... Do yourself a favor, go buy some good metal... CKY's ""Infiltrate.Destroy.Rebuild"", Atreyu's ""Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses"" or even Avenged Sevenfold's ""Sounding the Seventh Trumpet""... you'll thank me for recommending these unique and ridiculously better albums in the end..."
1,Pretty Much What You Would Expect,"Typical sycophantic teeniebopper oriented emasculated corporate rock with worthless intellectually incompetent ""suck-up-to-authority"" lyrics sung in a pathetically effeminate deep throated whine by a black haired southern boy with the mind of a neolithic troglodyte. Saliva has one message and one message only: ""conforming is cool!"" I can easily picture these guys ""partying down"" with your local pastor at one of your church's frequent youth group parties. Warning: listening to this valueless hogwash is bound to lower IQ scores by 60%."
5,A breakthrough,"This is Saliva's breakthrough album to me, and it's the first one from this band that I ever put my hands on. I was intrigued into buying this album after I heard the song Superstar 2 on the internet and decided to listen to it. But, Superstar 2 isn't the only highlight on this album. Weight of the World is my favorite track, followed by Always, Raise Up, and Storm. The rest is pretty much Saliva at their pinnacle. But, there is one problem. I hate it when bands use the same key for most of the songs on an album. Superstar 2, Back Into Your System, All Because of You, Raise Up, Separated Self, Rest in Pieces, Storm, Holding On, and Pride all contain the C# key. That's the only problem with this album. Other than that, I think this album is this band's breakthrough.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"
4,Saliva is back in my system for sure.,"I absolutely love this album, Saliva just keeps getting better at what they do best. This album is a bit softer than the previous albums, but nevertheless, it rocks. Josey's awesome vocals backed by a great band that works and plays well together, is what will keep the hits rolling from this great group formed in my hometown, Memphis,TN. The hometown heros will survive the long haul and this album is proof of that. Love you guys, Live they are awesome."

1,very poorly made,"i got the earrings in the mail today. The stones are not put in nicely. it looks poorly made, nothing at all like the photo. Where the stones hang, it was bend and when I tried to bend it in place, it broke off. So now, I have to go to a jeweler and get a new earpiece. They're definetely not worth the price."
5,Let your Merc Breath Easy,"When it was time to change filters on my 3.2L V6 Mercedes engine, this filter kit was what I ordered. It comes with two filters - enough for the job. Easy to swap for preserving good gas mileage and clean air delivery. It didn't look any different than the factory Mercedes filter I took out (except being clean)!"
5,Flanders and Swann,"It is great to have these recordings on CDs now - I remember seeing Flanders and Swann way back in the late 50s and early 60s in England and Washington. Unfortunately, two of my CDs from the 3 in the box do not work - I put them in the CD player and it comes up ""No disc"". The first CD - At the Drop of Another Hat"" works perfectly. Naturally I am very disappointed that I can't hear the other two - does anyone have the name and address of the people who made the recordings? Otherwise, it takes me back in time to hear Flanders and Swann again - a terrific duo.Janet Hoffritz hhoffritz@juno.com"
1,Mine broke as well!!!,This thing broke just a minute ago.(2mos old) #@#%@#% Was decent for those 2 mos though.
3,Not his best,"I find this first effort of Coco's with Aligator Records somewhat over produced. While it is enjoyable listening it doesn't have nearly the fire and intensity of his earlier work with Blind Pig Records. I would particularly recomend,""Ya Think I'd Know Better.""These pevious efforts are more reflective of his background work with John Mayall and Albert Collins. If you buy this cd, you will not necessarily be disappointed, but his earlier efforts will rock your blues soul!"
1,"I would give this book 0 stars, definately a'don't read'book",Spiritual warfare is definately very real and is something all christians should know how to recognize and fight...but NOT in the way this book presents it.
1,Dangerous book,This person is deluded. That part that said she was sick and dying and The Lord was not able to heal her because of the Satanists having they're hold on her and only the intercession of her pastor saved her. God had no one above Him and the devil can not overpower Him. Won't waste my time reading any further piece of trash written to influence weak minded oeopke
1,Excuse me?,"WHAT! How can anybody mistake witches for ""satanists?"" We follow the wiccan reade ""An it harm none, do what thou wilt"" Does this sound like ""Satanism"" to you? I don't believe in the Devil. Any witch/wiccan/pagan (call them what you will)...could tell you that the Devil is a christian figure not part of our religion. This is the persecution all over again. How many people were killed in the name of your God? More people have been murdered in the name of Christ than any other religion I can think of."
1,research research research,"I bought this book several years ago but never got further than 30 pages...something was nagging me (the Holy Spirit) that kept saying is this truth? I finally picked it up again last week to start reading and just couldn't get into it until I found out who the auther was. I did some research on Rebecca Brown (Ruth Irene Bailey ) and elaine (Edna Elaine Moses, a/k/a Elaine Moses, a/k/a Elaine Bailey (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""Edna Elaine Moses""),and found out several things about each. I really encourage you to do some research on these women (elaine died a few years ago). Read about their history.I agree with the review by A. Daniels Jr. ""artscholar. But just want to add that the things in the book are not all truth. Do your research!By the way....the book I have now is in the trash and will be thrown away.http://answers.org/satan/brown.htmlhttp://www.pfo.org/"
1,sad display of exploitation,"The woman Elaine, depicted in this book was a real person. Rebeca Brown former Md mis-diagnosed her leukemia as demon possesion (sure any doctor could make that mistake, right?) and spent a great deal of time shooting herself,Elaine and Elaines daughter up with demerol and having group prayer in her private residense out in the sticks. When brought up on charges, Brown suggested that the state of Indiana might secretly be part of a satanic conspiracy. It must have been so because she is no longer allowed to practice medicine, even under the assumed name of Rebeka Brown.If you really want to read xtian literature try Leo Tolstoy. At least stuff like that has the ability to make you think as opposed to believing there is some great conspiracy out there trying to destroy the church.Im sorry but if the Masons or Marilyn Manson are in control, do you actually believe people like Rebeka Brown or Bob Larson would be allowed to get away with writing this kind of book."
1,The book could not be father from the truth,This book is nothing more than lies writen by a christian who wants to force her foolish dogma on everyone else and keep them for the truth that Lord Satan has to offer. If you buy this book you should also buy Anton Levay's Satanic Bible and compare them.
1,EXPOSED!!,"Who is exposed here: Dr. R Brown or Forces of Darkness??Both. Neither.Although I find the territory she covers to be vitally important, I do not find her a trustworthy guide.Esentially she claims special insight. She claims special insight into matters of extreme importance and power.She is aware of her credibility gap as is her publisher. To my knowledge she has been very unaccountable. She has not answered questions that credible persons have asked.When I heard her in person I believed much of what she taught to be sound. And I found the content and style of the presentations she gave with her husband to be highly suspect. She did not look like a very well person to me."
3,Eye opening,"This book really opened my eyes to the spiritual world we cannot see. It is very sensational and written in vivid style. It is also provides an inside view of a forbidden and secretive subject. However, as a former journalist the book left many unanswered questions. I was trained to always provide proper attribution and factual background. While I believe the book, its lack of names, dates, places, etc. leaves it open to criticism from skeptics. Perhaps Dr. Brown will provide such documentation in future works. I would very much like to know more, as I am now in full time Christian ministry and see spiritual warfare every day."
1,A joke...,"This must be a joke, I am amazed someone actually published this. Subject matter aside, it was horribly written. Disjointed, hard to follow, and pasted together with biblical quotes. I had heard so much hype about this book that I felt I had to read it to prove there was no ""evil"" attached to it. The only evil I got from the book, was the massive migraine it gave me. It was literally the worst book I've ever read and I have read some seriously disappointing novels. As a Christian I find it insulting, and after reading it I can only assume that the author is mentally disturbed."
2,not so good,"the lights are virtually useless, and if you use this don't expect stereo sound, i found out that the output comes out mono and i opened it up to see why...hot glued wires were touching, disappointed."
1,The doll has defects!!!,"I also purchased this doll for my daughter well in advance for the holidays and received it early in December (Amazon is great about shipping...Kudos!!). I went to program it a few days after I got it and it would not program and had to be sent back at the request of Fisher Price. I was told by their customer service rep that they were IMMEDIATELY going to send out a new one First Class Mail and am still waiting!! Thanks Fisher Price!! Your ""Customer Service"" needs better ""Service""!!!!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I bought this toy for my 3yo daughter. After she went to bed I got it out to program with the software that came with it. After putting the disk in the drive, it began to install but stopped after reporting an error saying access was denied. I went to the Fisher Price web site and went through a ton of menus and links to finally come to the interactive service for this product. After answering questions, it said they determined I needed a new disk. They sent a new disk that did the same thing. I thought it could have been my computer but I ran diagnostics and checked software versions, etc and nothing on my end. Had to return the toy, very disappointed that my daughter who absolutely LOVES Dora would not get to play with her. Thought about exchanging it for a new doll completely but of course, Christmas crowds had bought them all. :("
5,Best Dora ever,"I just bought this for my niece and while I had no problems downloading I did have a question about the toy. I called Customer Service and asked my question about uploading the software to another machine, which by the way you can do. I also asked when they would be open because another customer said Fisher-Price would be closed. Turns out the only days Fisher-Price is closed are Christmas and New Years Day. So for all you parents who have not programmed the dolls or are waiting until Christmas Eve, you will have support.I told all of my friends that they had to get this toy!!!!!"
3,3 year old hates it,I WAS SO EXCITED TO GIVE THIS TOY TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE HATES IT .I THINK DORA SAYING HER NAME IS A LITTLE SCARY TO HER.VERY DISAPPOINTING.
3,Fair enough Toy for a lil Dora fan,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old sister. At first she loved dora, then she started loosing interest. Dora just don't make her happy anymore.Dora's hair is out of order and her clothes gets dirty easily. The clothes cant wash take off so therefore u child cannot play with dora outside the house or else she will be a dirty pudding for ever.I like this doll at first but not anymore.i had to go and purchase another dora which she enjoys every day. Adventure dora is the best. she can bathe and change her clothes when u like."
4,Very cute,"My daughter loved it, then lost interest in her and has started playing with her again 9 months later. A little high priced I think, but still very cute."
1,1st one didnt work,I was so impressed with how simple it is to program Dora. I was so dissapointed when she did'nt work. I am sending it back today and hope I get a working replacement in time for xmas. Looks like a really cool doll. I'm sure my 4y daughter will love it. Hopefully I can put in another reveiw soon and give Dora 5 stars. P.S. Amazon/toysrus.. return policy/practice is AWSOME.........its so easy. Thank you Amazon!!!!!
1,TERRIBLE DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We bought this for our 2 yr old daughter and it would NOT download and kept saying doll not connected when it was connected!! Customer service said to send it back and of course we purchased it online and will take 3-4 weeks for a replacement!! Doll was defective and the research I did says the same thing....same problem for people!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS DOLL SINCE THEY OBVIOUSLY DID NOT TEST IT CORRECTLY!!!!!!!!! A very disappointed 2yr old on Christmas!! THANKS ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,very disapointed,"i was very excited about downloading the dora doll, everything was going good until the end when it ask to download and it said that the doll was not conected when indeed it was i called the support center and they told me that the doll may have a defect and to return it to the store, well christmas is 2 days away and they are all sold out and i have to send it back and i will get another in about 2 weeks. so my daughter won't have her doll for christmas."
1,Music Box Doesn't Work!,"I ordered two of these, and the music boxes are broken on both of them. They were intended for gifts, and I didn't find out they were defective until after the 30 day return window, so I'm stuck with them. Argh!"
1,Thrasvuchi!Shablaka!Babudon!Skotivaskati's!,"Hero is a sad and tragic book. It is also full of excitement, suspense, and a bunch of other stuff that no other book has been able to dish out. It was very exciting when they were going down river, but it was also very sad when Dennis dies. My teacher Mr. K also said he felt like crying when that happened.This book was thrilling when Arlie Leeper tried to sneak around Jaime's house to avenge his son's death. Arlie had it all wrong by blaming them for the death.I give this book a five stars. For it's action and excitement throughout the whole book. I won't say anymore, you'll have to read it yourself!"
4,Hold on to your seat for a wild ride,"Fourteen-year-old Jamie West can hardly wait to gather wood for the raft he is building with his cousin Jerry. When weeding the garden takes too long, Jamie decides to set the weeds on fire. He hasn't counted on the speed dry grasses burn, however, and soon the blaze is beyond his control. Jamie realizes only water will halt the fire, and he cuts the ditch bank, flooding the area and dousing the flames. Nothing could be more frightening, Jamie decides, before he and Jerry are stranded on the raft in the middle of the Payette River with Dennis Leeper, a neighborhood boy whom everyone tries to avoid. Their situation doesn't seem too bad, until they go over the first dam and lose Jerry from the raft. Hold on to your seat for a wild ride, which leads Jamie to discover what it takes to be a hero and a man. I'm using this as a read aloud for an 8th grade English class and they are loving it!"
2,An ok Book,Dennis is a bully he is invited to a raft trip he can not say no. They are getting ready for there raft trip but they let Dennis hold the rope they should have known that not to let him hold the rope. He let go of the rope know they are on the river with no padles and no idea where to go.I liked the adventure and it was pretty exiting. It tought me a lesson of freindship and thing you could say to someone if you did not like them.I did not like it because it was not a page turning fun book. I would give it 2 stars because I did not like it and I would recomend this book to people that like page turning book.
3,They work,"They work but definitely do not hold a charge as long as the Olympus battery. I haven't actually measured how long they last but I'm guessing the Olympus batteries last almost twice as long. That being said, they are still worth the price."
3,Door Scratch Protector,It does the job but I'm not sure if it's worth the money. The material is a thick plastic and arrives rolled in a tube. Purchasing a larger piece of Plexiglas and cutting it to a desired size may have been better and perhaps more economical.
3,Work for purpose intended......but,"One of my dogs insists on jumping on the door when he wants out. We installed a brand new steel entry door, and I wanted to protect it, so I thought this would be just the ticket. When it arrived it was a little stiff, so I let it warm up a bit before installing it. It came with a dozen or so 3/4"" diameter self-adhesive Velcro stickers intended to be attached between the back of the protector sheet and the door surface to help hold the protector in place. Unfortunately the adhesive on these stickers is insufficient to hold to the door surface. I constantly have to press them back where they belong, and the next time I look they are loose again, causing the door protector to hang askew. Therefore, although the plastic protector sheet works as promised, the self-adhesive stickers need to be improved. I'm going to have to see what I can devise to replace them."
2,Cat found a way under it and ruined door,"God love her, our cat found a way to reach up and claw between the velcro dots that attached the bottom of the protector to the door. Result? Her raked claw marks left the cheap bedroom door in tatters."
4,Excellent Coffee Grinder!!!,"I just bought this Coffee Grinder to replace a Braun Burr Grinder in which I had burned out and and replaced three motors. This grinder gives the most even grind I have ever seen in anything except commercial grinders in stores and coffee houses. For home, this gives commercial grind quality. For motor life and to keep from overheating the beans, the stepdown gearing for slower grinding keeps the coffee cooler and extends motor life. I would have given this a 5 star rating except for the fact that there is so much static electrcity with this (and many others) that coffee flies all over, but the benefit far outweight that inconvenience and it's best grinder I've ever owned."
2,Bittersweet - Frustrated,"At first I loved this unit. It was a very consistent grind between espresso and a coarser drip setting. However, the fine espresso grounds gets stuck in the adjustment ring, and as other customers have noted, cause the two tabs on the adjustment ring to break - ruining the unit. If still under warranty, they will ship a replacement part for free, but after three of these allegedly ""reinforced"" replacement rings, I am now stuck with the unit outside of warranty and it is broken. Very frustrating to deal with. Beware if you plan to use for an espresso grind...and maybe even for drip grind."
5,My Favorite Band!,"MSI are my favorite band! They are so good!!! This is true 21st century music. They are pioneers! I have never heard music like this, ever!! And never could have imagined anything like it! Amazing! Too many good tracks!!My Favorite tracks today are -Clarrisa - The best riff of all time is in this song!! ""If your so smart, explain this Clarrisa!!"""" OH YEAH!! Sick stuff!Cocaine and Toupees - Too Good!!! The best song???I Hate Jimmy Page! - Best chorus of all time! ""I HATE JIMMY PAGE!!""Harry Truman - Middle section is too cool for school!Faggot - Best techno ever! So Trippy!

Yah!!MSI = Yummy!!! Worship and Tribute!!!!I love their album ""Tight,"" as well!100/100 You can't ask for better!"
4,music to scare the neighbors with,"seriously though, if you dont get freedom of expression your afraid of bands like this. Its extremely sad that this world pushes music like this to the side to make room for things like Nsync and Limp Bizkit.....i have nothing against those bands so dont email me to complain, i'm just saying theres things out there that people write themsleves with actual feeling to them. this is one of those cds. while listening to the music you can actually picture an idea or feeling that the artist is trying to convey and u actually feel, and its not like having a crush on justin timberlake, its like wanting to scare people and its damn cool! definetly comes highly recommended if your into new things and dont mind getting looked at weird because ur an individual and not conformist who thinks they need to be like other people to satisfy their meager self worth."
1,Pathetic; At Best,"Mindless Self Indulgence is honestly a generic band attempting to sound ""different"" and ""unique"" with the sole intent of making money from the young teenagers who will most probably find this music to be some of the most ""intense"" and ""radical"" music that they have ever heard. Frankly, this band is a joke, and the members are clearly following the all too popular ""shock value"" system (see Marilyn Manson) to make it into the mainstream, which consists of poor, souless music to begin with. This band sounds like a hilarious cross between the Insane Clown Posse (popular in the redneck rap-rock spectrum) and perhaps Disturbed. END OF STORY: THIS BAND IS TERRIBLE. Their trite system of shock value is NOT shocking! That's right; they are NOT OFFENSIVE. Young kids THINK this is ""so offensive"" and are probably just playing it to piss their parents/ legal gaurdians off. Perhaps only a priest or nun (or any religious figure) would find this to be offensive- THAT'S ABOUT IT."
