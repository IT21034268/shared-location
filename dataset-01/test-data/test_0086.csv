4,Great reading for a hot day when you don't feel like working,"Yes, it isn't Alex Cross but it's still top notch Patterson. It's different and light reading. You won't have any deep intellectual discussions about it but, so what? It's entertaining. If you like Chrichton and the new Chris Snow books, you'll like this. I read the whole thing in one sitting."
1,One of his worst books,I like some of Patterson's books but not all of them. Usually ones I don't like are written with another author but this one was all his -- so I can't blame anyone else. I almost put it down the minute Max sprouted wings and flew. There was no way from the book jacket I knew it was science-fiction. I occasionally read Si-Fi or fantasy books but this one was poorly written and not very believable.
2,"Something you would see on ""The X-files""",Did not like the book at all. His other books are all really good and this one was a big dissapointment.
1,Disappointing in comparison to other Patterson Books,"I have read all of James Patterson's books and this one was a disappointment. I am not, however,a fan of sci-fi type books. This book lacked the suspense and action of Patterson's other books and I found myself continuing to read thinking ""it has to get better"". I would not buy a sequel to this book at all. Alex Cross on the other hand - I can hardly wait til he is back!!"
4,"Different, but still good!","I must admit, when I started reading this one, I certainly didn't expect the story that transpired. It is a thriller in the vein of the X-Files more than anything else. And as far as the actual writing is concerned, it is not up to Patterson's usual standards. The writing is very simplistic, and the character development isn't particularily great. So why 4 stars? Despite it's flaws, it is still an interesting and fast paced book. It's kind of like a Schwarzenegger movie - it won't win any awards, but it is stoill a fun, fast ride to the end."
4,Capitivating,"I have read a few other JP Novels. This was very different from his other explosive murder mysteries. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the sequel! Before JP, I had a hard time finding books that could keep me interested. Now I find it hard waiting to read from one book to the next. I'm hooked!"
4,Loved it,Read it before you start the Max series. I loved this book and I found it a very good read.
3,interesting,"Like James Patterson's works. Prefer Alex Cross, but really enjoyed this atypical Patterson effort. Took a little longer to read than the Alex Cross novels, but not overly long. I love Patterson's short chapters. Only negative was in the last chapter when the children met birth parents. They arrived at the base at 1200 hours and at the general's house at 0200. Don't think so. That would be 14 hours later and 2 a.m. I'm sure Patterson meant 2 p.m. and 1400 hours. A good editor should have caught that."
2,Go back to Alex Cross,"Even with willing suspension of disbelief this was too much. Could have used some serious editing. Flying scenes were inspiring the first few times, but everytime the story lagged, Max started flying. Also, too many loose ends not tied up."
2,Took me a whole week!,"This book is so predictable! It's not worth the money even if the book goes on sale for 50%off the original store price. It's entertaining for a kid, however, if you are an avid patterson fan, this is not for you."
3,"Not bad, but it's no Alex Cross","This book was not too bad, but most people who read James Patterson books yearn for the next saga of Alex Cross. When this book first came out I was so excited because I thought it was another leg of the Alex Cross story. I bought this book anyway because I trust James Patterson. I have gone back and read almost everything he has written and Alex Cross' stories are the best. Wait for paperback on this book."
3,Wait for the paperback,"I rather liked the change of pace, but please give the readers more credit. The narratives from Frannie were sophomoric and the ""love scenes"" were just plain silly. They sounded like they were written by a 10 yr. old..well maybe an 8 year old. If you can't be at least mildly sensual..leave them out! I actually started to laugh while reading some of this dribble.However, on the up side, genetic engineering is an interesting topic and this made for very fast reading. However, I wish I had waited for the paperback and not spent twenty bucks on this one."
1,Never again,"The only reason I bought this book: I was at a used book store and found two books I wanted, but learned it woudl be cheaper if I bought four books instead of two.(Go figure.) I finished this book in one night, but I'm not sure how I muddled through. This is one of the most unbelievable books I've ever read. I've done the sci-fi thing with ""Dune"" and ""Stranger In a Strange Land,"" but I was more inclined to believe in a sand planet and an alien in our midst than these flying children that Patterson presents. The good guys are too good, the bad guys are too bad, and in the end I was hoping for an upset victory for the dark side because I was so tired of the characters. My recommendation: read something else. This doesn't even rise to the level of beach reading."
1,Disappointment. The story line too far out .,"I look forward to any book by James Patterson. This story line,however, was a bit too far fetched for even my usually vivid imagination. The concept of Genetic engineering has always interested me, but children with wings, REALLY!"
1,An enormous disappointment!,Not worth a lengthy review. Please bring back Alex Cross as soon as possible.
1,"Ridiculous, Uninteresting...","I couldnt believe this was James Patterson, the writter of so many nail biting tails. Even when i was coming to the end of it, i could just put it down and come back after 1-2 weeks. I thought it must have been one of his older books but alas no."
3,When the Wind Blows angels fly,"I did it! I picked up another James Patterson. This one I enjoyed about the same. It has a premise that promises thrills & spills. Somehow it just doesn't take flight. I do like James Patterson's fast reading style, & although his imagery is wonderfully effective he had gaps that left me wondering what happened. Still, worth reading. ................"
2,Not as good as the previous novels,I think that people who have read other books from james Patterson will not like very much this novel on a completely new and strange subject. I hope that he can go back to his previous style.
5,The one that hooked me!,"My mother gave this book to me several years ago, and I just couldn't sleep until I had finished it. I was so in love with the characters, the science, the suspense, and the plot, that I went to research what other treasures this author had written...little did I know I had already read about four James Patterson books. I started the Alex Cross series over, and got hooked on the Women's Murder Club series, but my favorite will always be this gateway book. James Patterson is never as masterful as when he is writing fantasy! If you love this book, or if you like James Patterson and history, I recommend you read Jester. Jester is also by James Patterson, and is just amazing! I have read almost all of Patterson's novels, and his writing just keeps getting better. I love that he is not afraid to collaborate with other talented authors!"
5,@GMS,This book was an increadible journey of finding out about experamental studies done on a group of children taken from there mother's befor birth. Max and the other's were cool looking with human and bird like features. This book kept my attention while they were ivestigating who was responsable for the experaments and who the murderer of the veternarian's husband was. This book is about murder and mystery. I would recomend this book for anyone who likes a good james patterson book. @GMS
1,Thick On Paper - Thin On Character,"This is my third Patterson book during the last year. Fortunately, ""Cat & Mouse"" was entertaining. Unfortunately, ""When The Wind Blows"" and ""Hide & Seek"" fall in the same category -- flat characters, short/choppy chapters, and absurb plots. Perhaps Patterson feels cursed to be attached to a serial character in Alex Cross. He should take greater care of his literary reputation and bookselling draw when taking a detour from Cross. Face it, there are about 100 blank sheets in this book, the type is large and the lines are double spaced. We should expect more in quality, quantity, and value from a constant NY Times Bestseller."
5,This is one of the greatest books I have ever read!!!!!!!!,"This book was amazing! Never have I been so captivated in a book. Out of all of the books that I have ever read, I have never been so hooked on a book before. I couldn't stop reading it. I read the book in three days, and I would've finished it earlier if I had the time. Thats the fastest I've ever read a real book of this kind. The first book I've ever encountered thats a real page turner. For all of you who have read other James Patterson books, such as Along Came A Spider, Hide and Seek, Cat and Mouse, this is nothing at all like them. It doesn't have to do with murdering psycho-paths and gore and total killing. There's a few murders but none really explicit. I have to admit compared to the other James Patterson books, this one does seem a little childish, but still it is a great book. I recommend that you read this book it is amazing!"
4,Fly Fly Fly Away.........,"I only gave this book a 4 because I am not usually a scifi reader. It was a well written book and has the typical style of James Patterson. There is a little of every thing in this book with fantasy, romance, mystery and children. This can be a very descriptive book and there were a couple of parts that for me were a little to descriptive.All in all it is still a good book with a good story line. It is kind of scary to think this could happen maybe not to the extreme in the book.This book is worth the time and I did enjoy it."
2,Let's get back to Cross !!!,This was a better Dean Koontz book than he himself has put out in a while. Look forward to the next Alex Cross story.
1,"I don't think Patterson even wrote this book ,it is so bad.","I love Patterson's books, all of them, but this book is TERRIBLE ! I don't think he even wrote it. Perhaps the publishers were so anxious to get a new Patterson book out, they published some rough draft that he wrote as a college student. It was PAINFUL to read."
5,He has done it again!!!,He's done it again -- still my favorite author. I finished it in one sitting. The suspense was killing me. What's next?
1,"Oh, Puhleeze!","Patterson is writing WAY out of his genre. Isaac Asimov he's NOT. I can't believe I finished this miserable little story. I also think that Patterson should abandon any notion of writing from the female viewpoint in future books...he can't pull it off, drawing a shallow and petty character in the veterinarian. Like everything else in this book, she's ""small"" and empty. Pass it by."
1,when the wind blows? it certainly does!!!,"My honest opnion is that James Patterson hit his peak with Along Came a Spider. This book only confirms my suspcions. When The Wind Blows is a contrived X-Files meets Frankenstein rip-off. The plot concerns a lonely women, whose husband died mysteriously (of course) and the driven FBI agent who is on the case. Oh yea, get this: the agent is a maverick working against the wishes of his superiors. That has never been done before! The book gets off to an insipid chase sequence when two young kids escape from a testing facility. The kids are genetically mutated and have been given wings. Which humans have always needed. Of course the kid ties into the FBI agent's case and so does the woman. It turns out the woman's husband was involved with the testing. Every plot surprise is anything but. I could go on about uninspired dialogue but why don't you just go and read anotheer book. Or wait until another Alex Cross novel is written by the author."
4,Good Story,"I, too, enjoy the Alex Cross books--and when I read the back of this book nowhere did it mention Alex's name--So I kind of figured this wasnt going to be an Alex Cross mystery and took it for what it was. Why is everyone whining for Alex when they know he's not in the book. Get over it. I thought this book was a refreshing change and I enjoyed every page. The characters are fun and not too deep. James Patterson writes good stories and thats it."
3,My first Patterson novel,"The editorial review did a great job of describing the plot, so I'll skip over that here and just give my impression. People who don't like suspending their disbelief will not have an easy time with the plausability of the story. It is a fast-paced story though, and the protagonists are very likable. I'm probably nit-picking here, but my main problem with the book was the repetition of names. For example: there was a Francis and a Frances; a man whose last name was Thomas, a man whose first name was Thomas; at least four Michael's (minor characters, it's true, but still annoying). This was the first Patterson novel I have read, and I think I will give him at least one more chance since from what I've read about him he usually sticks to more plausible plots."
4,Well written page turner!,"Most of the time when I read the back of a cover and it seems sci-fi, I'm anxious if the author will make the book believable enough to ""care"" about the characters - Patterson has done this quite well.The book is a page turner with characters you care about and a while a bit sci-fi, the story is well written where you believe that something like the story in the book can actually happen. Overall, I'd rate the book a solid 8/10."
2,Not Patterson's best...,"I have read the majority of James Patterson's works. This was disappointing compared to his others. I have read other authors who can step into the shoes of another gender, but I don't think Patterson pulled it off. Far fetched idea, yes, but that's what fiction is all about. Needed some more polishing before it left his laptop. I will be waiting for his next one."
2,Great if you don't have Vista or 7,"The item itself arrived on time and in good shape, exactly what it said it was and for a good price but it didn't come with a driver. I hear if you download and install the right driver this item works great on Windows XP but I learned from personal experience that this it is nothing but a haste on Windows 7. If you have 7 just spend the extra $10 and get a dedicated, plug and play PC controller or at least one with a proper driver."
5,Great mitt,"Not too soft, not too firm. Took a week to break it in to be usable. Padding all around the fingers. Feels great"
3,A Good beginners Anime,"Voltage Fighters was the first Anime I ever saw, and it got me hooked on Anime. I started watching other ones, and realized, that Voltage fighters, while not a very good example of the medium, Is very entertaining, and a good movie to begin your Anime obsession with."
3,Quite...Jiggly,"This is the kind of a spin off of Fatal Fury. Here, we have a pig corporation, weird loves between family members, and generous jiggilation from the babies. Now, I know this isn't a very good title, but its fun to watch when you get the chance. The animation is good, the story is ok, and the fighting scenes are radical. Overall, this is a title to see, but probabely not to own."
3,This is great anime right here so see it!,"This movie is good for all those who like anime and fighting combined into one. You'll also like if you like weird, but not sci-fi movies. This movies' content should not be seen by children who are imature. It has some parts where it shows naked people. THe movie has a ton to do with fighting. I do not recomend this to be seen by children under 13. Profanity is in little which is most likely good. It is rated R, I think. The context of this movie awesome. If you like anime this is a must-see. I would rate rate it 2 thumbs-up. It is awesoome with a ton of action and violence. It shows little blood and gore which is a sign of a clean movie. It has no sexual activity in it. Overall I'd have to try not to rely on this review, but see it for yourself and decide."
3,a landmark study,"War, Central Planning and Corporations, a new book by Dr. Eugene Schroder and David Schechter, was the basis of Dr. Schroder's presentation at the Western Economic Conference in Seattle July 12. Dr. Walker F. Todd, formerly with the Federal Reserve, served as editor.Provocative acumen into how government control,Bureaucracy, centralized supremacy and the gigantic corporations operate together as a team. The book Details howthey affiliate to use egregious and unconstitutional powers accepted during feigning of national emergency.Extremely well researched, footnotes from Senate Studies, the Congressional Records and Rulings from the Supreme Court.A landmark study."
3,Fun to watch,"I thought the psychic Patrick McNamara did a wonderful job at conveying the atmosphere of a genuine seance at some of the most haunted places in the UK. Hearing the stories that the people working at these places have has made me want to visit all of them (especially the Mermaid Inn) and hold a seance of my own! I've always been intrigued by ghosts, and the sense of history you get from this DVD is amazing."
3,"Johnnie be good, band be awful","I would have thought that a performer of Johnnie Johnson's stature would have been accompanied by a quality backing group for his appearance at the Basement in Sydney. In all fairness, the 3 piece combo are obviously all skilled musicians, but while I was anticipating some vocal magic (a la JJ and Friends, or JJ and Kentucky Headhunters CDs)the band put together for this show could be best described as forgettable. The lead guitarist/vocalist has difficulty in adding any sort of life to his share of the songs, almost delivering them in a monotone. Johnnie sets up a mind blowing piano intro to 'Georgia' only to have it crucified by the flat rendition offered by the vocalist.Interaction between the band and JJ was often corny or stilted. The 3 stars are all for Johnnie's efforts. Interview sequence was mildly interesting. Overall, I found this DVD to be quite disappointing, especially as it seems to be the only live DVD available at present."
5,yeah i called you fat look at me im skinny!,"one of the best early 90's rap groups brings the memorable humpty song.these guys from oakland are kind of old school but they still release an album every couple of years,but you just dont hear abut them anymore cause the groups lost popularity.this is one of the best rap albums ever.its a classic in every way.the songs are danceable and long so youll have a good time playing it at social gatherings.when i put this cd on,it always brings back memories of my early years when everything was simpler and everybody nicer,anyways,its agood cd."
4,If Tommy's Boy Only Knew...,"I used to play this tape all the time especially Gutfest '89, but it wasn't until a couple of years later I picked a CD version and was disappointed that all the songs weren't included. Nowadays, I get were the record label was coming from. Not a lot of people were buying CD's at the time of this release, cassettes were still hot and easier access to the average hip hopper (not to mention cheaper than CD's,) plus, no one in hip hop even thought of doing a double CD and the remixes weren't done yet for Doowutchyalike & Packet Man until after the release of the single for The Humpty Dance, domestically anyway. There may be a very rare double CD found in the UK, but I won't know for a while. As far as a re-issue, Tommy Boy is long Out Of Business and the last re-issue of any CD was 3Ft. High and Rising and Stet's first two albums..."
3,rap cd for casual rap fans,"I like this cd b/c its part rap and part FUNK. Parliment Funkadelic is sampled to the max but that is a good thing.The 2 best songs are Humpty Dance and Dowatchyalike. Great party tunes with a cool, perverted sense of humor. The rest of the songs are good, but the others are the standouts.The music is not dated b/c funk/ P-funk is timeless. I love to upset hardcore rappers by telling them that Tupac never did any better than when he was with the Digital Underground.Want to get a party started or even better ...get lucky? Put on the Humpty Dance for your significant other, dance around with no shame or inhibitions, and your honey will just melt. Who can resist ""my nose is like a pickle and in the 69 position it'll tickle your rear"" (I think that's the lyric)"
4,Jigsaw Prime,"I've always loved Optimus, and being a semi-truck is what he is the best as, not that fire truck. But something they just haven't gotten right since Power Master Prime is how to combine him with his trailer without having to deal with too many detachable pieces. Armada wasn't bad, better hope your batteries didn't die.The instruction sheet is a little unclear about how to reconnect the trailer to the cab in semi form, you kind of have to guess it yourself to get it right. Other than that, this is a very good addition to the Optimus ancestry."
5,Not the last picture.,"The steering wheel is as advertised in the first three pictures, not the last picture which made it a bit confusing.The steering wheel is marked at a great price compared to local Gamestops, which made it more worth the wait.Faster than per usual shipping from the mainland to the islands.Extra kudos to the seller for actually shipping to the island without any problems."
5,Great book!,A must for anyone and everyone who believes in prayer! To intercede for others is important as is explained and proclaimed in this book in an exciting and thought provoking way!
4,Intercessors,Our prayer ministry group has been studying about becoming better pray-ers and this book gives us more knowledge and helps us to understand what it means to be an Intercessor.
3,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists of the Roses/ Shin Duel Monsters 2,"This game was pretty irritating at the beginning. The storyline tries to combine history and Yu-Gi-Oh! But it doesn't really go far. Fans of the card game or Eternal Duelist Soul will be surprised to find it's a lot different than any other games. You and your opponnet both have deck leaders, you can summon cards on the 8 spaces around you. Simple right, but that's where the game gets hard. It's a really small square. And the spaces are often occupied by walls that prevent you from moving. You have to move your creature to your opponnet's leader and if you attack him your monsters attack points are subtracted from your opponnet's. The Graphics are superb. And I don't really like Gran-Turismo's graphics. It's frustrating but if stick with it you'll find it's a pleasant twist from Duel Monsters."
3,passwords for new monsters,This is very good graphic wise as 3d monsters have interesting effects. This is simalar to the idea of that of pokemon stadium battles. A different twist that is different from the ps1 game is that you can not enter the trading card codes to get what ever monster you want. You have to duel five times to do what is called a reincarnation (duh) to get three additonal cards but have a very high chance to be a low level monster. Then if you complete the game series you can get a password for a new monster. I think by the time you complete the game you start to lose interest in playing to get a new password repeating a game over and over and over. It would have been more exciting for kids to be able to interact with the expensive cards they pay so much for to be able to have something more they can use them with. Knock Knock Konami wake up the wave is coming in on this one.
5,YUGI,"From what i heard this game is better than forbidden memories,and if it is you know that it's a good yugioh game for the PS2.The only thing that upsets me is that it comes out way down in Feburary,but i don't have to worry because i already rserved it."
2,IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME!,"I had not heard a good thing about this game, but I tried it anyway. It stinkys! I spent an hour playing the practice duel. They repeat the same thing over and over agian; it got old really fast!Thank goodness I rented it first. Trust me If your think of buying it, rent it first and save the money."
4,...YU-GI-OH ON THE PS2!!!!!!!!,"WOW! i couldn't believe it! I have rented the PSONE game it was pretty cool and i got the gameboy color yugioh game, it's better than the PSONE game. but WOW a Yu-Gi-O game on the PS2!!! I MUST RENT IT WHEN IT COMES OUT!!! well....... I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!"
3,Great game horrible seller.,Great game for anyone that likes yugioh to be alitele different and realistic :) but I has problems with this seller it took me to email them for them to even ship it after 10 days so just make sure to do routine check ups with them !
4,Pretty good,Well I like the game alot. The storyline is ok...but to me it was like chess. Plus it made me use my brain for once. The graphics are cool lookin. The weird thing was I changed name to different names and got different decks. Try this game if you like stratagy games and of course Yu-Gi-Oh!.
1,Not Like Yu-Gi-Oh At All,What a waste of money. I bought this game because I thought it would be like the card game but I sure was wrong. The cards are not even the same. They have differnt effects. I tried reading the tutorial but it takes at least an hour to fully read and understand it. My younger brothers couldn't even grasp the information. The story line is really fake also. It's not based on the tv show. It's based on a little bit of history but changing the names of the characters of the past to the characters in the tv show. If you're looking for a game that is closer to the card game and show I would buy the Game Boy Advance games: Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition Stairway to the Destined Duel and Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul.
4,Yu-Gi-Oh! game time.,It's a good game for those that like strategy games. It's almost like playing chess or checkers. Mainly more like chess though. Just that you have to plan ahead because each board is different in design and terrain.
4,The best game ever,I think it's graphics are the first of it's kind and is just like the tv show. It's astounding difficulty will get you hooked to this game for the whole day like it has to me.
3,Yugi review,Yugioh the most poular game since pokemon this game has tremendous graphics but game play is weak konami could at least make a game realistic to the game we play the card leader theorie is not well put together! The music and the characters look like papercutouts like in forbidden memories i give this game a 3/5!
1,NOT AN ORIGINAL STORY,"This book appears to me to be an almost exact copy of the story of Rasputin. He came from a religious background, faith healer, heavy drinker, seducer of women. Helped the Czar's son who had the same blood disease. Was poisoned, shot then drowned by a close associate of the Czar. This author took the Rasputin story and moved it from Russia to the United States and moved the time frame from the early 1900's to the late 1900's. My rating is low because it appears to me that the author did not give credit for his source of the plot."
1,STILL WAITING....,"I'm still waiting for the movie to start. I didn't see the first movie, although this one was bad. Crude sexual humor, fart and feces humor, and it really wasn't that funny except for the sour cream Sanchez which I had to explain to my mother. Brief nudity and you never see the girl's face attached to the Ta's Ta's, which means they were a body stand in. Outtakes and bloopers were just as bad as the film."

5,Still Waiting Rocks! Really!!,"Just watch it! It is so much fun. It flows joke after joke. Not all the drama like the first Waiting, I love this movie. I am a waiter, and this movie is closer to the truth. :) ""At least they are not picking on me."" God Bless Nick and T-Dog."
2,If you haven't already asked yourself most of these...,"While it's important to discuss some of the issues in this book with your potential spouse, I really feel that a lot of these questions are the type that get answered pretty early on in a relationship. Perhaps this is a book for those who plan to get married after only a very short relationship. If you've been together for any real length of time, you'll already know the answers to nearly all of these questions. These are questions to ask someone you've just started dating, not someone you're already engaged to. My fiance laughed and laughed at most of these, because they seem silly once you know a person well."
3,An okay book,"This book was mediocre. It lacked many of the more thought-provoking questions that similar books contain. It just was not all that in-depth. It is good as a supplement to a better ""before you get married"" book; not so good on its own."
4,Good Basic Textbook,"The book covers some business basics which makes it handy and useful for those venturing into new businesses but with limited background on how to start and run a business. The areas covered include the start-up process, marketing the business, bank accounts, bookkeeping, cash-flow forecasting, tax returns, business plans, legal entities, financing, import and export and insurance. The book is written in a simple and easy to follow style. Therefore I recommend it to budding entrepreneurs as it provides valuable advice that should help you start and nature a successful small business.Those with some business background will likely find the book to be too basic and can therefore pass this one."
4,a good book for a starter,"I was always curious to know the issues that a person faces when he/she starts a business. what are the steps needed, forms to fill, taxes to worry about, insurance to get etc. Kamoroff has done a good job at explaining various things in a simple language. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start a business and has no idea where to start with."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED.,"The record I ordered seemed to arrive in perfect condition--the album sleeve was exactly what I had purchased. Unfortunately, inside the sleeve I found a record by an artist completely unrelated to what I ordered."
4,I love 80's music,"This is a good dvd of 80's music videos.Sure beats waitng for VH1 or MTV to play videos. Bought it for Mike & the Mechanics. Wasn't dissappionted. Great price for the dvd,too."
3,is it worth buying?,"the first splinter cell game was amazing. It was fun to play and had great graphics. The best part of the original Splinter Cell was that it took more than a day to beat. I'm sorry but why in the world Pandora Tomarrow was ever released is beyond me. It was just as fun as the first game, but only half as long. If a third Splinter Cell game is to be released I'm sure it will be visually great and fun to play, but if anyone can beat the game in less than five hours then why even bother? Maybe they should wait until Splinter Cell four is released and just add the two games together! Chaos theory has great potential, but if it only has eight levels-and half of them are real short, than this game is not worth buying. just spend the five bucks or whatever to rent it, cause you wont need to keep it for more than one night."
5,Best Splinter Cell Yet!,"I can't recommend this game enough, it's that awesome. A must have for any Splinter Cell fan."
3,Best Video Presentation to Date,"This DVD presentation of The Count of Monte Cristo (1934) is quite a surprise! If you remember the colorized VHS version from GOODTIMES or the VHS version from NOSTALGIA MERCHANT from decades ago this new DVD from HEN'S TOOTH is a vast improvement. I'd give the video quality a ""B"" and the audio quality a ""B"" as well. The inclusion of the re-release trailer is another plus. Highly recommended!"
3,Could be better,"I ordered the CD in October and received it in a reasonable time, however the case was split. I immediately requested a replacement, and received it 5 WEEKS later. This one had many deep cracks. Both had been sent in a simple cardboard sleeve. I again requested a replacement and now in January still have not gotten one."
5,"""THIS DVD,IS A TOTAL BE BOP JOY !!!! ""","I prefer to listen to Stitt on Alto, which he play's all through these performances. J.J. Johnson , the father of modern Jazz Trombone. Howard Mc Gee an excellent underated Trumpet player, Walter Bishop Jr, one of my favorite Bop type Jazz pianist. Tommy Potters big bass sound and the father of modern Jazz drumming,Kenny Clark. If you like this type of Jazz, then you should be pleased with this music. I've played this 60 minute DVD at least 3 times with in the last 2 week's. Tunes;'BUZZY""(2),""MY LITTLE SUEDE SHOES"", ""LOVER MAN"" (2),""NOW'S THE TIME""(2) Recorded in 1964. P.S. I also recommend the greatest Bop sextet of all time;Charlie Parker;""All Star Sextet"" (My opinion). the CD is with Bird,Miles,J.J.,Duke Jordan,Potter,Max recorded in 1947, It's flawless !"
5,Farm living,"This book is a MUST-HAVE for any ""farmer wanna-be""Has SO much information that I bought it 6 months ago and have yetto get thru it all.WONDERFUL BOOK!!"
2,Disappointing,"This novel is so depressing. I read it because I heard it's timeless and it's referenced all through history books. However, this book was so depressing and upsetting that I didn't finish it. I guess I'm not entirely justified in giving it 2 stars, but I could not take any more sadness from this book, classic or not."
1,A truly wretched book,"I read this book for a comparison paper with Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. I soon found that it's three hundred pages thoroughly dwarfed the thousand in Ayn Rand's novel, due to it's dragging and morbid plot. I decided to at least give it one hundred pages for the story to develope, but found that after that trial period, all I really wanted was for Jurgis to die, so that the drudgery would end. If Upton hated American capitalism so much, why didn't he move elsewhere? I will never read another book by this man. -- Caleb Kelley"
3,Hard read,"I figured this book would be a hard read, but I could barely keep my eyes open reading it. I know its supposed to be an amazing book and I really love reading history, but its very boring."
2,Disappointing,This book started out great and was a pretty good but then just ended! I was let down; not a book I would recommend really.
4,Old Issues Re-Visited,"I finally got around to reading this classic. Truly, the Socialist viewpoint Sinclair held at this point in his life, coupled with his dramatic expose of labor conditions at the turn of the 20th. century, makes for interesting reading. I found it fascinating, depressing, and revolting...all feelings I'm sure Sinclair had in mind for his readers. I found the ending a bit ""sudden,"" and looked for an epilogue of some sort. As a result of this expose, and the reforms in food/drug laws (preparation and packaging), I would have hoped a sequel might have been written."
3,The jungle,The book is a good read. This edition is really low quality. I wish I would have known it was a cheap version. I don't really like reading books unless they are formatted well. If it wasn't for class I already would have put it down.
3,I NEED CLIFF NOTES,This book is very non-climatic. Don't get me wrong it has it's pluses.IF YOU HAVE OR KNOW WHERE I CAN GET CLIFF NOTES FROM THIS BOOK AT EMAIL ME @ AbercrombieStud1@aol.com Thanks
3,"O.K ,but not great","Upton Sinclairs' The Jungle is a a story following a family from Lithuania to the United States where they eventually settle down in Packingtown,Il. Upton Sinclair does his best to describe the life that these people might have had and fails miserably. To much has been dramatized to make the reader sympathyze with the characters. Now I'm not saying that these things never happend but to say that the vast majority lived a life much like those of animals ""so innocent while they are led to slaughter"" is ridiculous. The portrayal of the gangs running the city at the time is very well played out along with descrimbing the ""throw away society"" that we live in. On the whole I found this book very hard to finish but somewhat of a worth while read."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"I LOVE America! And this anti-American, anti-capitalism book is a complete offensive waste of trees and paper. I don't know why the schools don't use their precious little time reading more of the truly great and inspiring literature available!"
2,THIS BOOK WAS NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT.,"As I said in the top the book was good but not as good as I thought. I think that if you had nothing to do but read a book, than this is the book for you."
4,"Great story, but seemingly endless.","The jungle tells a wonderful tale of the struggles of an immigrant family at the dawn of the twentieth century. The mood of the plot is like a long roller-coaster, as everything will be going good, and then everything goes terribly bad, then things are good, then things are bad again, and so on. A really good book that I would recommend anyone to read as it is informative and interesting, but very long towards the end, as it seems Upton Sinclair is trying to convert the reader to Socialism. Thumbs up anyways."
5,Exquisitely written! I couldn't put it down.,"The Jungle was seriously one of the best book I have ever read. I was forced to read it by my US History teacher. At first, I didn't want to, but once I got started, I couldn't put it down. I recommend this incredible novel to readers of all ages who are interrested in this time period."
4,important book in american history,"This book is a very interesting look at the life of the immigrants in the early 1900's. This book had a huge a impact on society and is considered one the most influenial books in American history. It gives very detailed accounts of the stockyards, slums, unions and general city life for the poor of Chicago. I do not feel that Sinclair is a particularly great writer in the sense that his writing isn't very poetic and the characters' run into almost too much bad luck to seem realistic, but the book is very informative. By the end Sinclair writes a bunch of socialist propaganda, trumping it as the only hope for the common man due to the oppressions of capitalism. The book had more impact on factory life and food than on the politics of America. This is definitely a must read for anyone interested in American History or politics or labor or socialism or overthrowing capitalism."
5,fantastic,"I love the condition and speed in which this classic got to me, thank you, I am reading it right now!"
4,"Wonderful for literature, economic, or history buffs","A depressing account of life during the turn of the century, in all it's gory detail of union bosses and abused labor. It's the sort of story you read if you are trying to understand how certain types of ideas could become popular enough to move the needle on political thought.Poor immigrant Jurgis continues chasing the illusive American dream. Each time, he gets close to achieving a stable happy life, fate deals him a nasty blow.What is probably overlooked in this book, but an intriguingly well woven theme is the plight of women at the turn of the century. I've actually not heard of The Jungle being referred to as feminist literature, but clearly Sinclair is influenced by the movement of the time. The terrible economic situations, the systemic pressures and inability to be self-sustaining depicted by Sinclair can be described as nothing short of brilliantly executed."
5,Great Classic!,"This is just a well done story. It starts slow, a traditional Lithuanian wedding reception, then the promise of the American dream. Soon the American dream starts to unravel, we find strangers and employers all to eager to rip off the immigrants. This fictitious story hits too much historical truths and we all should know this history so that people never get taken advantage of the way these poor immigrants did. The close of the book the author seems to devote to the advancement of his political agenda, which is socialism. The story is a little dated, turn of the nineteenth century Chicago, but the underlying theme of social and political justiace still resonate strong."
2,What a chore to read!,Wow this book was a marathon to get through. When Upton Sinclair wrote it he meant it to be an example of how capitalism will corrupt and that socialism should be the preferred social setting. It was a complete misfire though and it only served to expose the disgusting conditions in the meat packing industry which eventually led to the creation of the FDA. Upton Sinclair considered the book a failure. I would have to agree with the reaction at the time. the meat packing scenes were the most memorable the rest was a complete chore to read.
2,Not what you would have expected....,"If you are looking for a hentai or sexual anime.. this is NOT the one. This only had a short clip of nudity and not even that good.. can find a better picture on the web for free.Basically 1st story is just about a song writter manager who uses his fame to lure other girls who wish to have a shot at singing, and basically sleeps with them.2nd story, allthough abit better for the story itself, was just a corporation of a president who worked at day and seduced at night with some plots twists as alot of love triangles and daughters trying to ask their boss to fire someone else who got the guys attention since she wanted him all to herself.But sadly.. this anime was not worth it and well.. is not even worth watching again. =("
1,They call this seduction?,"Tales of Seduction has no seduction. Just like the other 2 reviews, this DVD is not worth it if you're looking for Hentai."
2,its a beginners system all the way,The system is okay but needs more ram right out the box and a clean verison of windows installed. Two years now and I still haven't got all the adware and spyware off. Its good for your noncomputer people who are patient.
1,Psychic babel,"If you want a divorce get this book, if you don't value any thing in your relationship and do not believe in forgiveness get this book by all means.This book is very disturbing if you are in a relationship that needs help, it's all negative in viewing your spouse, a psychic's advice on why you should leave your spouse and seek an affair to find your soul mate. Marriage is not perfect and yes people do grow apart in there daily routines do to distractions, communication is the key. I would not use this book for advice on relationships it throws the children to the curb and incur ages a none loving family value."
5,Awesome!,"This book is thought provoking and challenges you to step outside of your miserable ""comfort"" zone by tapping into your deeper self. I have highly recommended it to others."
4,Great 1980s Hair Metal CD!,"This was THE best band to come out of Tennessee in the mid 80s, however, they actually broke up in 1989, not 1999 like the editorial review states. This CD was released originally as a 7-Song EP called ""Mark of the Rocker"" and received alot of airplay in Knoxville, TN and surrounding areas. It also has 5 great demo tracks that were added to this release that the band had originally recorded for MCA records when they were negotiating a deal with that label. Overall, it's a great CD and a bit of nostalgia for anyone who lived in the middle Tennessee area in the 80s. It's definitely worth adding to your 80s Hair Metal CD collection."
4,...wish you were her...?,"overall, a really nice over view. I do take some issue with the re-record/re-mix issue (...re the liner notes:what pisses him off so much about ""Proof Through The Night""?)...and where are ""Having A Wonderful Time, Wish You Were Her"", ""Purple Heart"" (both Bono co-writes!), and...""The Strange Case of Frank Cash and the Morning Paper""?...everybody is going to have their [...] about this collection. Even with the omisions, I am glad to have it.P.S. He did not mess with ""After All these Years"". I remember seeing him open for Elvis in the mid-eighties, Not even knowing who he was, this song made me cry uncontrolably."
5,classic tv at it's very best,"I tried for years to find the real McCoys on dvd finlly I jhave all the seasons. I was very impressed with the transfer to dvd both sound and pic. I do love classic tv, in my collectiom is gillian's island, donna reed, father know best, and many many more. I am so tired of CSI produck nowhere land, and all the crap on the so called reality shows, Classic tv was the first ofthe true reality shows, ok up to a point i mean it took the all the way to archie bunker to hear aa toliet flush.......thank you for reading and to all our Vets Welcome home"
5,Moments of Grace,I've read many of Neale Walsch inspirational books and this one by far was the best for me. Realizing that Miracles occur all the time was enlightening.The short stories of others open my heart and mind to be more aware of God's presence in my every day life.I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,Good Factory replacements,Bought to replace the factory speakers in my '99 Park Ave Ultra. Definitely worth the price. After a couple of weeks to break them in and loosen up the voice coils they sound better than the original set and have no problems handling the power from the factory amp. They are not quite as loud on the low end as the old ones but are much clearer for sure. I feel it safe to say they get down pretty close to the advertised frequency of 28Hz. I would suggest them to anyone looking to replace a factory set on the cheap and still get decent sound.
4,Homosexuality and Interracial relationships in a not so friendly time,"I had to read this book for one of my classes in college and I was glad I was assigned to it. It touched basis on all political and talked about issues that still occure even to this day, even though it was written around 40 years ago. Bravo to the author and it's a good read with a nice plot."
5,Essential to anyone interested in dyeing yarn,"From indigo to synthetic vat dyes, the procedures, safety precautions and methods to create your own beautifully custom colored yarns is in this small but power-packed spiral manual. I myself had prepared an indigo bath once, and enjoyed watching the slightly yellow bath turn greenish yarn startlingly blue-jeans blue when shaken in air (Utterly fascinating. If you teach school chemistry or home school, this manual could be a semester of science work.)Everything is included here, from equipment to recipes to weights and measures. In addition are suggestions on how to keep records (important if you want to reproduce anything again, and a full color section of yarn swatches.)Dyeing is fun, whether you use Kool-Aid food dye or prepare natural materials like barks, roots or berries. But there are safety measures to heed, so I recommend this book as an essential if you want to undertake this art in your fiber work."
5,AMAZING SPEAKERS,"These speakers are just plain amazing. Nothing beats them for the price. When they came in the mail...i set them up, plugged them into my ipod to see how they sound, and was BLOWN AWAY !! The subwoofer has some majorrr bass. The other 5 speakers manage to fill my entire basement with ear throbbing music. Great system, great price, GET ITT !!! you won't be disappointed."
3,Logitech X-530 70 Watt 5.1 Surround Soud Speaker Review,"They are good for the price although the item does not have to option to control each individual speak to adjust for personal preference per sjow. There is only one volume control for all. However, I still muct say that for the price, for a new system, one cannot go wrong and we still enjoy it's use."
1,So far not so good,Several of the negative posts here metion the fact that this company does not respond to email or phone calls. My order is not expected to arrive until March 11th but I had a few questions about the order. I called and emailed this company and there has been no response. I would advise that you not respond to complaints by telling people to give you a chance to rectify a problem before posting something negative and then show a pattern of not responding to emails or phone calls.
1,Not good for DVD or Game Console,"The product description for these speakers is misleading. They do not plug directly into a DVD player or game console. Then, after buying the adapters and doing the initial setup, three of the five speakers did not work. Perhaps these speakers are a good solution for PCs, but that's not why we bought them, and we immediately sent them back."
2,"Not the whole Bible, only the JST changes","Product description states: ""A complete parallel column comparison of the Inspired Version of the Holy Scriptures... and the King James Authorized Version."" The word complete here is misleading, because the only thing complete about it is that it includes all the verses that have changes. However, if you are looking for a version that's complete in the sense that it includes the whole Bible, this is not it. If all you're looking for is a reference book, this is fine, but if you want to sit down to read the Bible from cover to cover and be able to see the JST changes, this is not it."
5,a 100% satisfied customer.,"the size and quality of this product was the best. very, very pleased. in fact I've aleady ordered another one."
1,the house of adam,"i have bought 3 copies of the film, none of which have i been able to play on my dvd or computer. i have never had this problem with any other movie. i do not hold the sellers of these 3 films responsible, i believe there is some inherent problem in the manufacture of the dvd. has anybody else had this problem?"
4,"Splinter Cell, so what!",I've played Splinter Cell and it sucked. The camera is garbage and the aiming system is so skrewed up it's not even funny. I'd prefer MGS2 over Splinter Cell anyday.
3,good but no replay value,i bought this game and had fun with it...but once i beat the game...i had no desire to play it again....i'd say this is a game to rent.
4,Doesn's work on 360,"I had bought this hoping it would work with my Xbox 360, but it does not. From what i've been able to figure out, it doesn't work because it is a PS2 port and not an original Xbox game. I'm completely sure this would function properly on an original Xbox console, but if you are buying this and own an Xbox 360 on which to play it, you might as well order an Xbox original also. I am disappointed about this, but i have played the game before and it is entirely worth buying an older console to play it."
3,Don't judge De La by this album,"Although fun and energetic, this is nowhere near the best of De La Soul's work. A typical album from a group of young, creative kids, this is a fun record for a few listens, but has little lasting impact.If you want to hear De La at their best, study Buhloone Mindstate. If you want to enjoy some of the best musical contributions from the hip-hop world, listen to De La Soul Is Dead. This record is good, but only one that should be picked up to complete a collection."

3,A little less wonderful than the critics led me to believe...,"While I do love Anthony Hopkins, this tale of a New Zealander traveling on a shoestring budget to the USA in order to race his customized but ancient motorcycle at Bonneville Flats had a curiously uninspiring script. I was primed to love this, but I found myself becoming impatient in spots, bored at other moments. It may be a bit too quiet, and the makers, in trying to be charming and quirky, may have forgotten to throw in enough tension or suspense."
4,You don't need to like motorcycles to like this story...,Don't think you'll like a story about a motorcycle? Forget the motorcycle! The story is about a passion for what you love and not giving up. It's about traveling half way around the world and realizing a dream. Anthony Hopkins at his best. Based on a true story and a land speed record that still holds today.
5,Excellent,"Anthony Hopkins was superb. Good length, demonstrates fragile human relations that exists in our societies no matter what country."
5,An uplifting movie,"Blu-ray quality makes this great film even better. Any motorhead will enjoy the film, but it is a heartwarming film as well. Thumbs up!"
1,The world's fastest Indian,"I ordered it in English and it came to me in spanish, what a pain. Now I have to deal with sending it back."
2,I must watch this movie again,"After reading the reviews and seeing the movie, I doubt if it is the same one. As one reviewer wrote, it was a delight for the whole family... which member of the family thought it delightful how the fellow waters his lemon tree? Also, the fellow rides more women than motorcycles, (great for the kids). And as a bonus it features a transvestite. Another reviewer wrote it has beautiful scenery, salt and treeless mountains? Even on a film making level the movie was sub par - several scenes could have been deleted and the story line would not have suffered. The filmmakers like to say it took 25 years to make this movie, unfortunately it was not time well spent."
2,Movie was good - service and promise of delivery: Terrible,"I purchased this movie for my husband for Christmas and was promised on the order form that it would be delivered on or before December 24th. I was very pleased at this prospect which helped in my decision to choose Amazon as a retailer. December 24th came and went... Christmas Day came and went... and FINALLY on the 26th, the DVD was delivered. I was very annoyed. The surprise was definitely gone; even though he loved the movie.The World's Fastest IndianAmazon delivered on their promises of the product - however they failed at their advertised promises of delivery... very disappointing indeed."
4,"Upbeat, uplifting... don't listen to the nay sayers!","You have a dream. You're told it ain't gonna happen. But when you believe in yourself...The World's Fastest Indian isn't about a Native American. It's the story of New Zealander Burt Munro (played by Anthony Hopkins), who wants to take his modified Indian brand motorcycle to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and race against the timer and God.Against tremendous odds, as a man in his 60s, he takes a boat to California, buys a car, and tows his beloved Indian to the world-famous salt flats. He meets a collection of extraordinary people, and charms them as a Kiwi can.His world record stands today.Great, uplifting movie."
5,A great movie on DVD with worthwhile extras,"This is the second best motorcycle movie (after On Any Sunday. It is a very good movie on its own for those who are not motorcycle fans. I enjoyed looking for clues of historical accuracy and the inclusion of Rollie Free and period Bonneville cars. The story was a well edited depiction of Burt Munro's obsession. Hopkins was great. I thought of him as Munro, not Hopkins playing Munro. He obviously studied the text and old film footage of Munro, many of the gestures and quotes were spot on. Great job to Roger Donaldson, your quest paid off. Godspeed Burt Munro. I particularly enjoyed the addition of the original documentary to the DVD."
1,Bad Disc,"The disc was bad and skipped a whole section of the movie. Just when the movie was getting good, it went bad"
5,How the world used to be...,"Anthony Hopkins is a great actor. What I believe about him is that he has mastered the art of acting. When I watch him in a movie I forget that he acts. And in this movie even more so since he plays a real person.The movie's value is that it really encourages you to follow your dreams and fulfil them. Burt Munro not only did he make it, but after the first time, he made it nine more times as the end credits show! And this is a still standing record.Besides that the movie shows how the world used to be so that Burt Munro could fulfil his dream. Characters that Burt Munro met on his way were simple, understanding, having a fellow feeling, honest, hospitable, tolerant, ready to extend a helping hand and above all flexible enough to ""bend"" some rules so that a dream can come true. Check all these things in all the characters throughout the movie.A very entairtaining movie with great subtle humour and some great things that Anthony Hopkins says throughout the movie. Ta-ta."
5,The World's Fastest Indian,"Brilliant - moderately paced (slower than much Hollywood fare) imported film (from ""down under"") that allows Anthony Hopkins to shine. Amazing true life story about a man with a dream and what he has to go through to achieve it. If you liked Tender Mercies, Local Hero, The Quiet Man & October Sky - you'll adore this film."
5,Great feel good movie,"Anthony Hopkins is a great actor unlike most Hollywood ""Stars"". This is a true story of one man following his dream and overcoming adversity to reach his goal. Compare his performance in this movie to Hanibal Lectern and you can appreciate his skill. Great movie for all ages."
4,"Great movie, but I received the french version","I own this movie and bought another copy as a stocking stuffer christmas present. I received the order today, but the DVD is the french version with subtitles. The box is in French, etc. Returning to AMAZON and ordering another copy. The movie itself is wonderful."
2,Plastic toy lawn mower,Item arrived with as broken grass catcher. Amazon said to send it back as it was no longer available. Called manufacturer and they sent me a new grass catcher. For a very SMALL lawn area this mower will do the job. Cut clean and is easy to handle. Attaching the grass catcher to the mower will stress every sense you have. Finally wired it on. Poor design. The area I have to mow is only 300 sq.ft. so I will make do but for the cost it should be a much better built item.
4,"Compact, lite and easy to use",Purchase was made after reading various reviews. I have a small townhome and need a mower that would take up little space and be lite enough to store easily. The Bully meets all of my needs. The only downside is that the grass cather is a little tricky to put on the mower and the mower looks like you are pushing a toy.
5,Dave Evans Pays Tribute To Bon Scott,"This is an excellent album by former AC/DC lead singer Dave Evans. After he was replaced by Bon Scott in 1974, he went on to record with the bands Rabbit and Thunder Down Under before releasing some solo albums. This album was recorded at a Bon Scott memorial concert and Dave Evans does a great job on these eight AC/DC tunes, including two songs he originally recorded with AC/DC (""Rockin' In The Parlour"" and ""Can I Sit Next To You"")."
5,LCD COMPUTER MONITOR PREMIER MOUNTS AM2 SWING MOUNT,"This item is worth the small investment. I used this for a reception area to save room with our limited space. The arm swings out about 15""-16"" depending on how you need it. I have my monitor in the corner and the arm in on the right side of the wall. Just one tip- when I was mounting our 17"" Dell flatscreen monitor to the arm...I needed to use 2 longer screws for the top 2 holes and was able to use the little ones for the final 2. You might initally think that arm is a little stiff before mounted but after mounted it is perfect!! I paid $57.49 & FREE shiping using Super Saver. The arm arrived within the week!!"
2,"Update: Amazon made all better (Was: Ordered new, got used, incomplete, damaged)","The item itself appears to be a beefy, well designed mount. My problem is, after 11 years of ordering, with Amazon. This item had the wrong parts shipped with it, was partially opened, and scratched! It pretty much looked like I had received someone else's returned item. I would give Amazon one star but gave two stars for the ease of returning.Update: Amazon sent new item. Perfect condition, good product. (unable to update review to 4 or 5 stars)"
5,great mount,"This mount gave me all the things I needed it to do. tilt,swivel and extend out if needed. Came with all the hardware and a adapter plate for my 200-100 vesa mount. Good solid mount with no problems at a good price."
3,Not a good fit for Dell monitors,"I bought two of these to mount Dell 2001FP and 2407WFP LCD monitors. On these monitors, the VESA mounting holes are in a square recess left by the monitor stand's mounting plate. While the mounting arm's mounting plate will fit into the recess (barely), the holes do not match up. I had to go to the hardware store and pick up some nylon spacers and longer m4 screws to extend the monitors' mounting holes out so they were flush with the back of the displays.That specific compatibility issue aside, the arms work well. The cable management is OK for cables that have small connectors, but not for anything larger than a power cable. A DVI connector, for instance, will not fit through the openings. It's not a big deal, though. Strapping the cables to the outside of the arm works just fine, and you can't see it from the front anyway."
5,great for the price and quality,i just purchased a panasonic lcd tv model TC-26LX70.the mount worked great the mounting plate did fit my tv without drilling or making a new plate like some of the reviews. smooth operation and easy to install. matter of fact i had more trouble fishing the cable through the wall than installing this mount. i would highly recommed this mount.
5,Sturdy and easily posed,"The gem of this mount is the swivel plate that attaches to the TV. It's a dish mounted in a little bowl and can pivot about 5 degrees up and down, and its rotation is only restricted by the cables connected to your TV. The display I have mounted on it is the Olevia 323v, a 27"" LCD. I use it as a computer monitor and a gaming display. As a computer monitor, it's useful sometimes to rotate it 90 degrees to see a PDF in portrait view, and it's great to be able to tilt and angle it to face any point in the room squarely. I even rotated it so that it matched the angle of my head as I lay on my bed, to save my neck as I watched a long film. The rest of the arm is very sturdy and mounts by five thick wood screws into a stud in the wall. I'll be keeping this one wherever I move."
5,Great TV Mount,I have two of these and they are great. Very strong with a low profileon the wall. These mounts have endless positions and can be pulled awayfrom the wall quite far. You can't go wrong with this mount.
3,"Sturdy mount, but...","This is a great mount, very sturdy and easily supports my 32in TV. Be careful because the description leads you to believe that it is VESA 200/200mm capable, but it is not out-of-the-box. The included mounting plate is only 100/200mm. You must purchase an additional adapter plate (for about another $30) in order to mount TVs that are VESA 200 or larger. Go with the Peerless mount if you have a large TV."
4,An athletic Keaton playing a collegiate nerd,"For some reason College provokes the most extreme reaction of any Keaton film-- I've seen it called both his best and his worst by critics. It is undoubtedly a lightweight work, and marred by some racial stereotyping, but the main setpieces, in which Buster runs through gags on all the major collegiate athletic activities, show off his physical dexterity at its best and are as close to pure Keaton as it comes. (The idea of him playing a weakling is pretty quickly belied by the sight of his muscles in athletic clothes.) The tape includes three shorts that also fall pretty much in the middle of the pack, although Hard Luck is worth noting both as one of the last lost Keaton films to be rediscovered and as one of the blacker comedies he ever did."
4,"A bit little, but my bike looks awesome","I love these mirrors. Though they're a bit small, which makes it a little tough to see what's behind me I love the look they give my 2007 Ducati Monster."
1,High fructose corn syrup,"Special K is loaded with High fructose corn syrup. Being on the special K diet messed up my gut for months until I was finally diagnosed with Fructose Intolerance. HFCS is not a natural food, it is engineered with enzymes. It makes foods in the US cheaper and sweeter."
5,Striking and beautiful work,"This book reveals a little known part of Roman and Italian history that is incredible. The photos and the information presented are fascinating and this book makes a wonderful addition to any collection of art books, photographic volumes or Italian cultural texts. The composition and presentation of the photographs is truly striking and erotic without being in any way prurient. It is absolutely a true work of art about incredible works of art!"
5,QB 7,"Typical leon uris , has you into every character from beggining to end,weaves a story on each character and then brings everything all together like the master he was."
4,ORDER IN THE COURT,"This book was a tad slow to get going, but once it did, it didn't let up. The court room scenes were top rate, and I was biting my nails to see the outcome. Uris does a great job with character development, and the pain and pathetic mental state that the doctor shows is heart felt and genuine.This is definitely one to savior, however because of the slow start I give it 4 stars."
3,I love Spyro! But the last two were better.,"I'll keep this simple. Nothing really new, but why change a great game? I loved all the Spyro games especially the last two and I hope another one comes out someday! PLEASE?However, I could not complete the game 100% (all the dragonflies) to beat the final boss and it irritated me. It was the level where you have the time limit to kill all the bees...I just can't do it and there are no cheats(for the desperate)so I would rate the last two games as better."
5,GREAT GRAPHICS,"IF YOUR A SPYRO FAN THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.DIFFERENT SCENCES,SAME CONCEPT AS SPYRO YEAR OF THE DRAGON.THREE DIFFERENT POWERS FOR SPYRO TO USES TOO.GREAT GAME!"
1,They can do better than this!,"I love spyro,I bought the game before reading the reviews(wich was a big mistake)played it and then my system froze!Yes it is a cool game but it takes so long to load!The graphics on the last games were way better.The game is so short and simple.It only took almost 2 days to finish.So I rushed it back to get my money. Take it from me,I have played some extremely good games but this is not one of them.Do not buy it no matter how cool they say it is.It will freeze up and it took 10 min. just to get from world to world.They can do better than this crud."
2,"When it works, it's great...","The graphics are great, when they don't disappear or if the camera doesn't get stuck in a wall. The sound is great, when they don't stack on each other. The levels are challenging when you can 1. not freeze up and 2. get loaded into the right level after saving. The controls are sluggish and if you are used to using the D-pad with Sypro, get over it. It offers nothing in response. The other buttons work most of the time, but it gets annoying when you push the triangle button, you do a head bash and all you wanted to do was center the camera. I'm glad that Universal is offering refund on this badly done game. I'm going to go the Game Cube addition (only after I rent it first.) No one that has reviewed has the same problems."
4,I love it but....,"I understand why people are upset because this doesnt measure up to the classic spyros...ive been playing them since i was 5 (im now 16) and its just a slap in the face theyve started changing spyro so much. i know moneybags is a fat greedy bear that steals your gems but it sucks you only see him once in the game!! and what about bianca and hunter? you hardly see them...and the controls SUCK in this game. whenever you try to turn left or whatever spro slowly takes his time to do it. Theres not good balance at all. Another thing is theres only 1 world!! that makes this game way too short! BUT...overall i really like this game, just because its not exactly like the older spyros doesnt mean you shouldnt give it a chance. At least its not like the newer ones!!!"
2,A disappointment,"In response to the ""big disappointment"" review -- you can sleep soundly knowing that you were right in not believing it was from the same team as the other Spyros -- it isn't. The team that did the original 3 Spyros moved on a few years back -- I believe they're the ones responsible for Ratchet and Clank.All else I can say is that you're also right in saying it's a big disappointment -- cruddy framerate, very short, and they stole quite a lot from the first three games. If you look, even the font they use is stolen from the PSone games, and those looked better!I don't know if you'll have much more luck with the gamecube version, but perhaps our favorite little purple dragon won't be a Universally lost cause."
2,The Basics Are Missing,"As a long-time fan of the PS1 versions by Insomniac, I was hopeful that the new developers would have little reason to release anything less than excellent for more capable hardware. Man, am I disappointed.While the worlds are more lush and detailed than the PS1 versions -- as are the characters and effects -- the frame rate can't keep up so it really doesn't matter. No, it's actually worse. I'll take smooth action and responsive controls/camera over lush detail every day. The game has locked up on us three times so far, too, resulting in having to do a lot of stuff over again. It's not as bad as our experiences with Theme Park Roller Coaster for PS2, but it's the only other game that has crashed for us."
1,Save your money,"I loved the first three Spyros for the Playstation and one of the reasons I bought a PS2 was for Spyro: Enter The Dragonfly. What a disappointment, I read the other bad reviews and decided it really couldn't be that bad, boy was I wrong, it was worse. Low frame-rates, glitchy controls, it just didn't have the same feel as the other Spyros. I set it aside for a few weeks and tried to play it again, it's barely playable at times and incredibly frustrating. Do yourself a favour, buy Ratchet and Clank or Sly Cooper, both are much much better games."
1,Buggy,Got the game for my sister. Very disappointed as the game is unbelievably buggy. Can't beat game.because different breaths in game dont work even after doing what is needed to achieve them. Waste of money. Do not buy!
3,Already disapointed,"I have been a Spyro fan since the start and I must say that after trying the demo, I was very disapointed. I already found things I didn't like or missed from the YOD. This is terrible."
2,It's not insominac!,"I love Insomniac Games (the first three Spyro & Ratchet & Clank) and unfortunately, this game doesn't stack up. There were a lot of problems with the game."
2,"well, it is better than the Legend games..","I really liked the old games, but this one had too many glitches and was too short.. only took me an afternoon to finish it. Only thing I can say good about it is that it's better than the two games they put out after it (a new beginning and eternal night).. I like the old way of wondering around whereever you want and having to figure out lots of little puzzles.. linear playing is just too structured."
3,Read This Review If your thinking of getting this game,"The first Spyro game I ever played was the 2nd (Ripto's Rage) one for the good old Play station 1. Then the 3rd(Year of the Dragon),and then the 1st(Spyro The Dragon). The worst of the 3 was the first. The second one was a lot better,but the ultimate and my favorite Spyro game is definetly the 3rd.I highly recommend it. Since they got better every time I thought the 4th (Enter the Dragonfly) would be even better. I WAS DISIPOINTED! THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF. BUT... If you haven't played number 3 or 2 it's an ok game."
2,The Magic is Over,"I was a huge fan of Spyro and couldn't wait to get this latest addition, but after playing for a while, I found it to be a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money on this one. The original creators of Spyro were not in on this one and it is so blatantly obvious. Universal Interactive should be ashamed of this attempt at what they call a game. Insomniac originally created Spyro and they did an amazing job. Universal's Spyro has too many glitches and flaws to list, not to mention the game is drastically shorter than the first three. If you want a great game, try Insomniac's latest creation for the PS2, ""Ratchet and CLank."" It is where the latest Spryo should've been with amazing graphics, countless challenges and breathtaking worlds to visit. Spend your money on that one, not Spyro. If you must try Spyro, rent it. You can finish this Spyro before it has to be returned!"
1,big dissapointment,"This Spyro game had everyone excited, but when it finally came out, it sucked. The game looks great and it has new features, but that doesn't make up for all the problems with it. It's gameplay is slow, and the storyline is for a 5 year old. With this game, Spyro lost all his attitude. In my point of view, the developers didn't even try on this one."
3,It's a fun game,"I don't think this game is the best I've ever played, but then again it don't deserve the horrible ratings its getting. We have to remember that it is a Spyro Game and your not supposed to really look into them. This game is fun because of all the different ways you can engage in an adventourous journey through the life of a dragonfly. If you are thinking about it, rent it first and give it a shot, but I also recommend buying it if your into this type of game."
1,Very disappointed at Spyro,"I am a big Spyro fan, and I bought this right when it came out and was bummed out. I seriously wouldn't recommend this game. If you've never played any Spyro games I'd recommend the 1st 3. They are REALLY awesome :) but this ps2 game is boring, and the graphics pretty much suck. It gets me dizzy just playing it b/c the camera shakes at times. If you still want to play this game, (in my opinion) you should probably rent it."
3,Good but... disappointing compared to the older spyro games,"Maybe I'm biased because I was hoping it would be like the spyro games for playstation one. The game kept freezing and stuff... and the controls are weird. The graphics are okay but not great. Also when Spyro charges into something in this one he takes like 3 seconds to say ""ow"" and it gets a little annoying. I unfortunately don't have enough room on my memory card so I can't save the game and since it keeps freezing I haven't been able to get very far. Oh well. One day..."
5,Very Good,"I got this product a day sooner than expected and started playing then and played with my neice and nephew. The game was not scratched at all or dirty. It in fact still had the instruction book in the case. I am very pleased with this game and am happy with it. I recommend this game, it is simple and fun."
2,disappointed,Although the book was helpful I was disappointed but not surprised to see that Regardie's comments were removed so much for the OTO ... I may burn this copy and do without it....
4,A GOOD SOLID DISC,I Really DIg THis Album.De La Soul Sound Good On this Disc&Come Correct with All The Fronting GOing On In Music at the time.Their Words&Music have always Been Challenging.A Good Solid Disc that is On point.
1,So boring...,I don't know how anyone could write a decent reveiw of this book. There was no character development at all -- the only interesting character was the villian and there was no resolution at all to her story line. She was the only one I even cared about by the end of the book! The author completely relied on stereotypes to outline her characters. The book's plot was so unbelievable and yet predicatable at the same time -- which is the author's only achievement I can think of. I watched reruns of Oprah instead of reading this book. Buy it used if you have to buy it at all.
2,Relative distress and Mistrust,"A novel comprised of 319 pages that Cosmopolitan promised would be a ""pool-side page turner"" is anything but and the only real comfort found in reading the novel is that the reader has the power to skip pages. The third person omniscient view made for a drawn out narrative and too much depiction on emotions instead of action. It is very slow paced, almost boring me into submission, however the ending seemed rushed. Good writing, poorly implemented gave meaningless yet influential characters such as Bunny, Alice and Adrian the opportunity to ""fluff"" the novel. It took too much time to get to meat and bones of the story and by the time I got there, my appetite was ruined. The enchantingly cliché ending and impressive storyline almost makes up for the boorish execution of events by uniting a family and banishing the primitive prima donna."
4,you gotta try this!!!!,"DDRMAX1-2 are two of the most energetic games ive owned and played. These games really make a person get off there butt and dance. Even the music gets my hips moving.ha ha.once you've played this you go into a disco stance.trust me.I first got ddrmax when i heard it was a game that has a work out routine. I lost 24pds, in a year. true story. well i hope you read this cause you got to get this game. seeyah.!!!"
4,Fun Fun Fun!!!,This game is one of the best games that I've seen. I first saw Dance dance at an arcade. Then my friend got it and we played it for hours on end. I'm going to buy it but i want to know if the mat comes with the game. I can't wait to play it. It has so many songs!! max 300 is so hard!! i couldn't get past like the 12th arrow before i failed!! haha! i want to get better at it
1,Don't buy this game,if you buy this game well then return it. its is the worst ddr ever made. you should stay with ddr:konamix
4,Best Game Full Of Fun,"this game has got to be, not only the best DDR yet, but also the best PS2 Dance game ever! loaded with tons of songs to fit everyone's different taste with user controllable settings to make ur play the best... they could have made the song selection layout a little more high tech but, either way, it still surpasses the original DDRs. would highly recommend to anyone who wants a lot of fun for less than 40 bucks..."
4,"These are nice, inexpensive earrings.",My wife loves elephant earrings and these are nice. They are a bit on the small side but they are very nice and she can leave them in all the time.
4,Educational Resource,I am studying Revelations right now and its hard to find some good resourceful matherial that is easy to understand and this book simplifies what the scriptures are saying about Revelation.
3,Chrome shut off shower valve - not what I expected,The valve is very good in looks however the shut off does not shut the water off entirely. Water still comes out of the shower head even when in the off position.
1,still wet,"Name of product: DANCO Shower Head Shutt-Valve The only truth in the name is VALVE, there is no shut-off about this product!I purched 3 and all 3 are leaking worse than the Titanic after hitting ice! Upon closer inspection, 2 of the 3 apeared to be repackaged, my guessn would be RETURNS! That is what I will do next."
4,Good construction but a little loud,"This is a great product and is made of solid construction. It's also easy to operate with the large finger turn-off. But if you're using it as a throttle to slow down the water flow, then it can be a little loud. Maybe it's just loud in my shower as the noise echos off the tile, but I just thought it would be good to let others be aware before purchasing."
5,Multiple Shower Heads,"I purchased 2 of these to use on a multiple shower head installation in my fully remodeled bathroom. For me these substituted for a $350 + Labor diverter valve install. I'm happy with the savings on that end and also enjoy the ability to save water while soaping up like most others who purchase this valve.My only point of contention on these valves, is that as most others have indicated, they do not ever fully shut the water off. For me, while I would prefer the water shut off completely, this is not a big deal. This being said, I do applaud Danco for the simple design of this product. While it does constantly leak a little, based on its design (all metal and no discernible wear parts), I wouldn't expect it to get any worse with time, as opposed to other similar valves which are designed to not leak, but eventually leak very badly as parts wear out."
2,Don't stop the water,Had to send them back! I bought three and non of them stopped the water dripping even when turned off. Seemingly well made but of no value if they don't do what is required.
1,jm,"When I installed the shut-off leaked, I did install the rubber washer supplied and sealed the threads. The shut-off also does not shut off completely, it allows water to by-pass. I would not recommend."
5,great product,"Product was just as described, priced right, came in a timely manner and has worked well, wild recommend to others."
4,Excellent quality,This shutoff valve is excellent quality and mine has not leaked. I have only used it two times in my camper before winterizing but I was very happy with the performance of what I experienced so far. The reason for the 4 stars is one small gripe. The valve turns 180 degrees and it is hard to tell if it is on or off when not in use. This means that when you turn it on while in the shower it is a 50/50 gamble as to whether the person before you turned it off or not before exiting the shower. So I just marked mine with a small permanent marker to show where off is.
5,A troubling yet gripping story,"So many readers question Mitchard's credibility... she wasn't attempting to write a dissertation on the mormon religion - she wrote a really good, incredibly engrossing book. There might have been errors or discrepancies, but this is fiction and it served its purpose as fas as I was concerned. It kept me reading and kept those pages turning turning turning. It is hard to imagine something so awful as watching your two little sisters be murdered - this is definitely not a ""feel good"" novel - but a gripping read to say the least."
2,Heavy Morman Theme,"I thought the book was very well written, but that the Morman angle was over the top. There are stereotypes about Mormans that are not true, we GET IT. I skipped over pages of ""discussions"" on the Morman faith. If it was not for that theme, I would have reccommended this book to my friends."
3,"OK book, information about LDS was interesting","At our book club meeting, the book's topic of forgiveness generated a lot of conversation, as did the insight into a Mormon family's lifestyle. The plot was far fetched and no one in our group could relate to how Ronnie acted/reacted, starting with her move to San Diego. It was a quick read and the ending tied everything up with nice little bows."
3,Not bad but ...,"The story is definitely a downer: two little girls murdered by a man who should be on medication, the reactions of their parents, and mostly, the reaction of their older sister. The story flowed well, but the dialogue between the sister and her parents didn't ring true to me. The book is thought-provoking."
2,Repetitive and dull,"I kept waiting for the clever revelation to happen and it just fizzled. It was an okay, though not mind-blowing, story drawn out way too long and then wrapped up with a lame, tidy, sugar-coated, ending. Mitchard took way too long to build up and then seemed to run right over the top of the climax and denoument, barely touching the characters. Would have made a better novelette at half the length."
3,Did it have two authors?!!,"Part of this book was so amazingly written and the other part was like it was written by someone trying to sell Mormonism. The two didn't mesh well. And they could have...how someone uses their religion to cope with devastation. But the two parts were written in completely different styles. When reading about their emotional reactions, it was heartrending. But reading about the Mormon faith seemed kind of factual, like it didn't fit in or flow. I don't know. It ruined an amazing story."
5,Excellent resource to prepare for PHR Exam,"Cathy has done amazing work with this book. It is extremely well put together all the topics which are essential to pass the PHR exam.The exam alerts, notes and cautions are very useful and let you focus on what you need to know more. It also contains practical study tips which helps you organize yourself and stay motivated.I highly recommend this to those who are preparing for the PHR Exam."
5,I pass the PHR,I use this book as a complement to my study plan for the PHR certification exam. It was very helpfull.
3,"Helpful, but not a keeper!","I just passed the PHR exam and wanted to share my thoughts on the study materials used.Overall, this was a C+/B- resource. There was something about the writing style that made it very tough to get from page to page. That said, I still do recommend it as a secondary resource. The biggest problem for me was the MeasureUp disc that comes with it. The disc can only be used with windows//It is not compatible with Mac.Finally, I will keep two of the other resources that I used. This one will be sold.The resource that I felt was most helpful with this was the Study Guide by Anne Bogardus."
5,EXCEPTIONAL VALUE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST SCHUMANN INTERPRETERS EVER,"I disagree completely with the parallel made by the first reviewer: Nat-Kempff. Kempff is over simple, direct, lacking the ability in underlining Schumann's feverish changes of mood. Its simplicity is Mozartean, but even Mozart has certain secret coins that Kempff cannot grasp. Nat is Nat: violent at first but then intimately nuanced, evidence is the starting point, even if an evidence of a corrusque character, completely different from Kempff's clarity...but then all the moods Schumann invented are given with the utmost refinement and intellectual promptness...every detail is a step in the ""journal intime"" written by Schumann. A French critic, described posthumously Nat as France's Richter...naturally there are tons of differences, but in both cases we have two virtuosos at the service of the soul of the composer...their mood is on phase with Schumann's."
5,"I Love You, Mary Jane",When I saw this title I just had to look at it as my mother's name is Mary Jane and I just know after the last year or so I need to tell her more how much I do Love her. Even if this book is about a dog I just know in her heart she will know what I mean. Plus she has a dog she loves with all her heart.
3,"Incomplete, but useful.",McVeagh's book is the first published bibliography of Irish travel writing and is a solid achievement. It will offer many the chance to read texts they would otherwise not have known about.
5,Saves your hair and skin from well water.,I have been using these for 2.5 years as my hair was breaking off and not growing back. It was definitely hard stinky water' I am the only one using my shower so I change the filter every 6-8 months. I could not live without these filters and a good conditioner plus I also started using cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo so all three changes working together probably gave me the best results. Amazon is the best place to get anything I ever need.
5,Best Game Ever Made for GBA!!!,"This game is so much better than the previous Castlevanias. Except for symphony of the night. Great adventure, storyline, and suspense. The main thing is you go around and build up your character and collect items that allow you perform certain movements or boost your players attributes. The spell books and items are way better. Mix spell books with items to really enhance the effects. My favs are wind and dagger,wind and cross,and fire with book. The castle(s)are divided into sections that are set at different levels of gameplay. Excellent graphics, the controls may take some getting used to. One of the things i like most about this game is you grow with your character. You get better as the game goes on and so does gamplay. This is a must have for the Game Boy Advance system!"
5,descriptive account of anorexia nervosa,empathic portrayal of anorexia nervosa by a pioneer in the field; it has human descriptives of everything characterized scientifically in textbooks and journals.
1,Absolute Waste of Money,"This book is an absolute waste of money. I have previously bought the Charlton guide to RD Toby jugs and I am very pleased with its detail and help with identification of varieties. This book is not what I expected. It shows one picture of each figurine with some information and a ""price value."" Anyone who knows value guides knows that they are out of date by the time they are published, and that is not why you buy it. If you want to know a value, you go to ebay and see what they are really selling for. I bought this guide to see what the varieties were of my Balloon Man figurine, which has a number of color variations. This book has one picture with no varieties. It had less information than I could gather simply by looking at the listings on ebay. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,"Royal Doulton Figurines, 11th Edition - A Charlton Standard Catalogue by Jean Dale.",A useful catalogue for the collector of Royal Doulton Figurines.
3,like it...but it does have problems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I want everyone to know I just bought this item. If there are any problems later on down the road with this MP3 Player, I will post another review. Hopefully, I won't have to. Follow up 1.21.2011 - Player freezes up from time to time. Also, when it does this there is a percing sound that goes into your ears. Pulling out the battery and putting it back in resets it. However, this is a pain if you have the protective case on it. Other than that, it has bee a good product."
4,Nice and sleeky mp3 player.,This is a nice mp3 player. Good value for money.Easy to copy songs. The ear phones work really good. I would recommend this for any one.
1,"Froze up at start screen, totally useless","I bought this for my wife who used it sparingly over 2 years. She probably replaced the battery 4 times. It worked well while it worked. Then one day it froze up in the middle of a song. No matter what is done to it, it won't get past the start up screen. Go to the SanDisk Sansa Forums at http://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/ and you will read about many others who have experienced this fatal error."
3,hmmmm..........,"Well, I dont know. I read the reviews from the others but in my opinion, this panic disc is not the best. It does have some moments but they seem like they just got a lot of freedom from their new label and did a lot of things their former label didnt want,in particular that ""edgier sound"" which I dont like so much. You know that hard rock sound guitar like in ""Postcard"" from Everyday. I dont know I dont like that sound too much. The disc is definitely worth picking up though. I like ""Little Lily"", ""Part Of town"" ect. but I think they need to smooth out the sections a little so they transition a little better. Does this make any sense? I dont know that is just what I think, maybe I havent gotten to see them live enough lately... Anyways if you dont have Aint Life Grand, Everyday, or Light Fuse... Then get all four!!!! They are a great band, there is no denying....... Dont tell the band but I actually picked this disc up at KMART, I couldnt believe they had a copy!!! see ya"
2,Not what I expected,"This band is touted as the new Allman Brothers and as a great jam band. If they are, it sure isn't evident here. I had hoped for something in the vein of ""Ain't Life Grand."" It ain't here."
4,Very good,Its not WSP's best outing but well worth a lister...its still the boyse doin what they do best...jammin
3,Good reference for technical trainer,This is the one and the only book dealing with technical trainer certification. Author has done a great job in covering comptencies and standards of Certfied Technical Trainer exam. The book is equally useful for all the technical trainers whether or not appearing in CTT+. The treatment of the subject of technical training is very simple and effective.
4,"Good sound, good value",Bought this for my bathroom and I'm very pleased with the sound and functionality. I specifically went for this model because it will play MP3s as long as the file ends with .MP3 (I noticed another major brand that will only accept MP3s using their own sofware and needing Windows 2000 or ME... this Panasonic model takes older MP3 discs). I have one gripe and it's significant to me. You can't play your MP3s in shuffle/random mode. That REALLY stinks when you have a 200 song mix. Random only works with normal CD's.Sound is beefy and just about right for a smaller room.
3,Has anybody else experienced cd no eject on this unit??!!??,"I have bought the panasonic sc-pm19. However, I noticed that cd is jammed at the display model that they have at COSTCO. The attendant couldn't explain it. Then I saw the review on Amazon that cd does not eject.Has anybody else experienced this?thx,Mohmd."
5,One of the best choices for MP3-CD microsystems.,I searched high and low for 2 months finding the right microsystem for my office and this is it. This unit has surprisingly nice sound with superb clarity. The eq settings are very useful in lowering the bass so you dont have thumping bass coming from your office. Also offers manual Bass/Treble adjustments. A real plus is that the system reads MP3 ID3 Tags and scrolls the album/song title for MP3-CDs. Plays all ranges of MP3 quality beautifully.
1,Junk,"I really can't review this item based on it's sound as it arrived broken. It appears the CD changer is jammed, and none of the other functions will respond. Very, very dissappointing, as it was a gift, and now it's too late to return it to Amazon, so we're stuck with it and now have to PAY again for shipping to have it repaired. Garbage! Don't buy from Panasonic!"
1,The Godfather of Sprawl,"Corbusier's theories, as much as anyone's, led directly to the dis-integration of the city in favor of the elements that we currently know as sprawl. And he specifically celebrated the things that today, we are trying to painfully wean ourselves from. For example, he exulted over the fact that ""I will live 30 miles in one direction from the office, while my secretary will live 30 miles in the other direction from the office, and together, we will consume enough gasoline and rubber for tires that we will keep several people busy producing them."" OK, so that's not an exact quote because it's been several years since I read the book, but that's the essence. Look it up, and others like it, and you'll discover that this guy's ideas are responsible for greater destruction of western urbanism than World War II. Seriously. Look at maps of cities in Europe before the war and after. Then look at them in 1970, after Corbusier's ideas came to fruition. You be the judge."
5,A legal thriller equal to any Grisham's,A roller coaster legal thriller. Keeps you in suspense at all times of who committed what crime and why
5,Feel the tension melt away.,"I'm keeping this short and sweet: If you want music to get lost in and relax to, this is what you need to purchase. The songs are very simple, but remarkably beautiful. If you're not careful, you'll miss them...because you'll be sleeping from the soothingness. Feel the tension melt away."
3,Yes and No,"As an Iranian, I was amused by this book. Yet, it is not a book which I would recommend to a non-Iranian seeking to learn about Iran. The author had a very interesting journey through Iran,full of humurous, strange, and frustrating experiences. Yet, either she did not understand our rich culture and heritage,or she was unable to convey it to her readers. The aspect of the book I did appreciate, was the author's ability to portray Iranians as the warm, hospitable, kind, and generous people which Iranians are, contrary to the perception of many Westerners. If you are Iranian, don't expect to learn anything new, but you will find many of the encounters entertaining. If you are non-Iranian, and you are going to read only one book about Iran, I would not recommend this particular book."
2,Will not last,"I received this set as a gift four years ago, and am still using it until I decide which stainless steel set to invest in. I have no metal utensils and have handwashed all my dishes for the past eight years; however, the non-stick coating began to come off the smaller pots about two years ago -- one has no Teflon whatsoever at this point -- and they are now all in various stages of 'Teflon-shed.' The cookware isn't terrible, but I expected to use them for longer than four years. The likelihood that the peeling Teflon will be considered evidence of 'abuse' on my part and not a 'manufacturer's defect,' plus the cost of shipping it all back to Wearever, prevents me from returning this set under warranty. Purchase this set if you don't mind upgrading within a year or two to something more durable."
5,More info,This item features a performance by the Scottish National Orchestra Wind Ensemble. Very nice sounding.
1,Not as Advertised,HW Brass cleaning products are the best I have used. They are soft and pull all of the moisture (and other stuff) out of my horn. They do not scratch and they have a little springy-ness to them that helps get them through tight turns. However I expected to receive all the parts shown in the photo. Clearly shown are two pull through swabs and a valve brush stick. One swab is for most tubing while the smaller swab is for the narrower lead pipe. The smaller swab is absolutely essential for a cornet and very handy for a trumpet. The set I got did not contain the small swab.
5,Another Best by Heinlein,"Telepathic twins, Tom and Pat, were identical. One would live on earth and age gracefully, while the other would stay forever young and roam the galaxy, but each is equally important to the other.Another great book from the best, Robert Heinlein. His portrayal of the future is almost real. Hard to put down once you start."
5,4.5 stars,"A waif, unable to speak, turns up on our hero's doorstep just as he's going off to war, and he gives her a place in his household.Over six years later, he's back, she's all grown up and his mother's companion. She still doesn't speak. He's cynical and suspicious about that.Lady Silence has some nice intrigue, but the best part is the emotions in this one."
4,Open Mind? You Will Enjoy This!,"If you are an Eno fan and understand that cover versions of songs often differ from the original, you are very likely to enjoy this. Like the man himself, the musicians here playing tribute have had a lot of fun creating new textures of sound and using them to create atmospheres, ambiances and little songlings. Most of the tunes capture something of the spirit of the originals and some of them (e.g. Sky Saw by Brand X)even use them as foundations for rather more elaborate constructions. The Farflung number is particularly enjoyable and is very much in the spirit of Eno's first solo effort, here come the warm jets."
4,"Very suspensful, well-done","Some details still puzzle me--e.g, how did the murdered plan to retrieve the hooked rope that enabled him to climb to the floor above? Still, the movie is very suspenseful and clever, and i found it very entertaining."
5,Elevator to the Gallows,"An auspicious debut for Malle, just 25 when ""Gallows"" opened, this superb thriller pairs a noirish plot involving two murderous couples with a lurid, claustrophobic atmosphere. Julien's efforts to escape the crime scene are intercut with shots of the car thieves's dark exploits and Florence's aimless walks along the Champs-Elysées looking for Julien--a bold technique, in that the film's protagonists remain isolated for most of the picture. Moreau, who cemented her career on the strength of this performance, is a vision of distressed beauty, woefully illuminated by the glare of nighttime Paris. Lean direction, vivid camerawork, and a moody, soul-stirring jazz soundtrack by Miles Davis further emphasize the air of grim fatalism. Edgy and twisted, these ""Gallows"" will leave you hanging--and you'll love it."
4,a murderer trapped in an elevator,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Elevator to the Gallows, known in France as ""Ascenseur pour l'échafaud"" is Loius Malle's first major film.It follows a man who murders his boss in his office and gets trapped in the office building elevator when the power is shut off for the night.The film has an excellent original score improvised by Miles Davis.The DVD has some fine special features in a double disc set.Disc 1 contains the film with theatrical trailers.Disc two contains an interview with actor Jeanne Moreau, director Louis Malle, actors Maurice Ronet, Maurice Moreau, and soundtrack pianist René Urtreger, Footage of Miles Davus and Louis Malle during the soundtrack recording, a film about the score with music critic, Gary Giddins and jazz musician Jon Faddis. Also included is Louis Malle's first student film Crazeologie.This is the best edition of the film currently available and I recommend it highly"
3,JUMP AROUND,"If you like the hardcore-hip hop-rock JUMP AROUND is all classic, this song is the boom, other good songs: PUT YOU HEAD OUT featuring B REAL and house and the rising son."
1,This is censored!,"All the swearing are censored.Really spoils the cd.It should say in the description,if I knew I never would have bought it."
2,WTF?,Ok seriously WTF? I got this as a recomendation because I Rated My Life with the Thrill Kill Kults sexplosion? Who the hell is doing the comperasions for the recomendations on this site? While this is one of the few rap albums that I wouldn't automatically shoot someone for putting on I dont see the connection.
5,Works Great !,I purchased this cable a few months ago to hook-up my new Toshiba-DR560. The cable works great! Very good picture and NO problems so far. C
1,Buyer Beware - What you see is not what you get,What Amazon sent was Impact Acoutstics black HDMI cables. I'm working on the return now. The only thing that's the same is the model number. I can't even find what they shipped on Amazon's web site.
4,Good Value,I have (and will continue to) spend hundreds on some cables for specific applications but if you want a low price cable that delivers high quality video for a game console (PS3 / Xbox360) this is hard to beat.
1,"Cheap, not worth it","these cables are cheap, might as well go elsewhere and buy them from monoprice for $3"
1,Defective cable,"I bought this cable to connect 50"" Plasma TV to computer. When we connected the cable with TV we could not get it to display computer screen. We spent 2 hours with Plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection. At the end, at our dissapointment, we found out that the cable was defective. When we tried different cable everything worked."
2,"Works, but quality not great",I connected these to my blu ray player (bd-p1400). The video had a lot of noise. I went to wal-mart and bought a $40 HDMI cable and they have a much better video quality.I will kept these cables as a backup.
5,Best Connection!,"I am very pleased with this cable. It is the best connection for my PS3. The picture is great and the sound is awesome. Even though my TV can only do 1080i, using this HDMI cable give a better picture than my component cable. Dont buy those overpriced monster cables. This is a digital output. So this cables will work great!"
5,Why pay more? These work just fine.,"I bought two of these cables, one for the cable box to the TV and the other for an unconverting DVD player to the TV. Using these cables I have excellent picture and sound quality on my new Sony XBR4. I can't imagine what benefit there would be to expensive HDMI cables - these work just fine."
5,Good Value - Works as advertised,"I shopped around for an HDMI cable that was long enough for my particular setup. I was skeptical that this cable would actually work, since similar length HDMI cables are priced well over $50.I connected the cable between my Sony DVD player and 50"" LG Plasma. I immediately saw a picture improvement over the component connection. I would recommend this cable to anyone looking to get an affordable, relatively long, HDMI cable."
4,A few misconceptions,"I ordered one of these today, and it looks to be a good cable. And really, anything under $10 is cheap enough to not worry about.However some have said since these are digital signals and not analog, nothing matters for quality as long as it works properly. You would probably need $50,000 worth of gear to see a large difference between $5 cables and $200 cables.When digital signals are at a high data rate it can make a difference, just like with analog.As an example, try running 100 Mbps Ethernet (all digital) over phone line or cat 3 wiring or cat 5e that's too long."
1,drops signal,"mine wasn't reliable. I had it connecting my DVR and my new HDTV. I replaced the DVR and still had the problem. It would drop the signal and I'd have to power cycle the TV to get the picture to come back. When I switched to component cables, the problem didn't reoccur."
4,"works and looks as expected, but could be cheaper.","its an hdmi cable, as good as any other of the same class. price could be lower, but its still cheaper than many other store brands."
5,HDMI Cable,"The HDMI Cable makes a great addition to the new Plasma TV. Delivery was fast, I will continue to shop on Amazon."
5,Excellent Product,"I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 3 to my 46"" Samsung LCD. I've had it for about a couple of months and have had absolutely NO problems with this cable. Save yourself the money and buy one of these. I recommend doing so to about everyone who needs one. I dont see why people spend >$60 on an hdmi cable in the stores."
3,Good but not perfect for every use.,"I bought two of these cables because of the price. While the cable that runs from my DVD player to my tv seems to provide a good picture, when I hooked up my Samsung 32 inch to my cable box from my provider I was dissatisfied with the picture. After buying a new cable from Radio Shack the picture improved significantly. However, buying this Cables to Go cable is worth the risk as it may work with your setup and if it doesn't, you've only wasted $10.Yeah, that's my 2."
2,"Micro, what happened to your style??????","Holy sh** was I ever disapointed when I herd this cd. I own all of his cd's to date and have seen him live, but I was however let down by this cd. All of the tech mix cd's are were his talent shines through, but not this one."
1,awful!,"Wow, a waste of money and time! This was the stupidest movie I've ever seen. No plot, no entertainment, just pure garbage. We didn't even want to finish watching it, but did because we thought the ending might be worth waiting for - it wasn't. The only reason I give it 1 star is because there is no -5 star rating."
2,Watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do,"This movie seemed too long and boring. There were some funny parts, but only very few. Iwouldn't recommend buying this tape. If you are really bored, just go rent one. This has to be one of the worst movie I saw this year. Don't buy this tape."
5,john waters collection,"Woweee!!! I wasn't really familiar w/ John Waters except the original Hairspray, (which is wonderful!:-), but holey guacamolee~ this guy is truly a loony tune!! I love his work, his cast, the writing... It is so off-the-wall & entertaining... definitely Not for the faint of heart. If you have a quirky sense of humor, & prefer to travel outside the boring, predictable hollywood sh*t, then Mr. Waters is for you!! (alot of fun to exercise to :-) An A++ in my book!! :-)"
5,This is excelent,"I'm a french man, and for me and for a lot of french people, this is one of the best french comedy. Jean-Claude Dusse is the most famous french lover all around the world... I think this film must be seen by all person who love France. In our country, the title is ""Les Bronzés"". You can contact me if you want more informations."
4,Long Live Inu-Yasha!,"Though Inu-Yasha is not as lovable as Ranma1/2, I would reccamend this book to anyone. It does not contain the vivid artwork of some other creators, but never the less the artwork is fabulous. The only thing that I object to the is the price. Are they ever going to lower the price of this grpahic novels to something that won't leave you flat broke?"
1,I had a bad feeling about this! And I was right!,"I was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links Jedi wisdom to Christianity. Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life. But, I say that any religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional.I am convinced that Yoda is a Zen master; the Force is derived from Tao, not God as interpreted by the orthodox religion(I am purposefully leaving out Christian Mysticism, which is another beast altogether.). A better book on the subject of theology in Star wars is ""The Dharma of Star Wars."""
1,JEDI CHRISTIANS??????,What the hell are you people on? Well I guess it is all science fiction anyway so you might as well go ahead and mix them.
4,Tsarist Russians against the Germans and Austro-Hungarians.,"Prof. Stone has a great book on the war in the east durningWorld War I. Since this book was written in 1974, it might nottake in all the current details coming out of the former Soviet Union. In the book, Stone refutes some of the common perceptionsof this war. The ultimate reason for their defeat was not anunwillingness to fight the war, but the incompetent leadership-both political and military- in the waging of the war. In somecases sush as Brusilov, the leadership was very good and nearly suceeded in knocking the Austro-Hungarians out of the war. This is probably the only book so far on this part of the war."
2,Just didn't like it,"I had read that this was THE book on World War I. So I bought it, managed to get through it barely, and threw it out, knowing I would never read it again.I don't know, I just didn't like it. It was not good reading. Seemed disjointed, there was a lack of maps, it just didn't read well for me. It was boring. Sorry, I know all the experts seem to love this book. I just didn't.I am STILL looking for a complete decent military history book on the Eastern Front, WWI. Any suggestions?"
2,Creeped out of my mind,"I viewed this movie in my Honors Spanish III class and was incredibly disturbed by this movie. The whole entire time that I watched it, I was creeped out and felt very eerie. I do think, however, that the movie did a wonderful job in portraying just how violent and horrific Franco's Spain was at the time of the Spanish Civil War and the effects that it had the Spaniards. This movie was full of symbolism and deep meanings that I knew were there, but couldn't quite understand, but that is probably because I'm only 16 years old and not able to comprehend some of lives' truths very deeply. Though the cinematography and acting was EXCELLENT, the movie as a whole left me feeling very unsettled and disturbed."
2,I don't get it,"I really wanted to like this film, but I just don't get it. I have to agree with reviewer Marc.If you love the type of European cinema which is slow, dark, and sinister, then you'll like this. If you prefer something more lively, you won't."
5,a pleasant surprise,"criterion has the habit of completely delighting me from time to time (more often than not). 'spirit of the beehive' which was a kind of chance purchase for me paid off.. This ranks among the finest films i have recently seen - a rich evocation of childhood- and a fairy tale like homage to an older world.. and to well.. frankenstein. Sometimes, very rarely to be sure, we feel that we are so touched by something that it is almost on an unconcious level.. someone might, for example, experience this familiar yet unexplicable feeling from watching the wizard of oz or reading lewis carrol.. this is the sort of feeling i got from the spirit of the beehive.. at the risk of sounding too emotional in my reaction."
2,Definitive Recycling of a Revolution more like...,"I thought this book looked great when I first got my hands on it but the more I looked at the less impressed I was. If you've read any of the more popular books about the early punk scene, ie. Please Kill Me, England's Dreaming , Vacant.. then you'll already have read most of the quotes in this book. There are some great pics in there which I hadn't seen before but so many of them have been published many times before. There are quite a few errors in the original text as well..(like calling The Clash's second album ""Thanks for Giving Us Enough Rope""'!!!.. made me laugh!). If you haven't got many other punk books then this is probably a great place to start.. otherwise only get this if you're an obsessive (like me unfortunately.. I'll keep it for those few new pics)."
4,WOW! Don't leave home without this one!,"This is Quite an undertaking! Large format, many unpublished Photos & Interviews, make this an indispensible Book. It let's the insiders of this phenomenon tell their story without Journalistic translations! A close look at the Music, the Fashions and the lifestyle, all combined to change the world. Poseurs always get it all wrong, but these guys do not have that problem. WOW don't miss out, now be original!"
2,"Love the man, dislike his book","Like many of the other previous reviewers, I think the world of Robert Klein as a comedian, so I had high hopes when I purchased ""Amorous Busboy."" Unfortunately, unlike other recent memoirs I've read (Billy Crystal's and Alan Alda's), Klein's was sorely lacking in humor. Not to say that he wasn't funny when he tries, it's just that Klein rarely makes even the attempt at humor throughout this overly detailed book. The most interesting parts, not surprisingly, deal with the development of his talent and career, but that constitutes a relatively small portion of the book, the lion's share having to do with his sexual development. This book was a big disappointment!"
1,False Advertisement,The picture of the item to be sold is not what I received. After checking and double checking the picture was of the machine and that's what I was trying to purchase. I purchased the ribbon to go with it but all I got was to ribbons. I am highly upset because I was actually trying to get the machine. To me this is false advertisemnt - the picture and the words do not match. I think you need to change this immediately and I need to order the machine.

3,"Great at first, ultimately disappointing","Listening to this compilation gave me the chills at first, but it was also an introduction for me into Jobim's work and Bossa Nova in general (though this is cetainly to Bossa Nova per se, don't get me wrong). After I started exploring other recordings and returned to this CD, I realized that it's not that great after all, flawed actually. Buying better headphones didn't increase my appreciation for the mastering either."
4,Never disappointing,"Sue Miller writes about people we know. She writes about simple things we do like going to the grocery store, getting divorced, opening trunks in the attic and finding treasures. You think you should be bored when your reading her books. After all, the characters are mundane, suburban, real. But you're not bored. You're completely sucked into their stories, their lives, even their small not quite shocking at all revelations. And like Elizabeth Berg she says something so big in a story so simple that the impact is quite memorable. The World Below makes an impression. It makes a point. I like it when stories have a point."
1,"The WORST product, support, service","Where do I start? In the past Magellan used to be a pretty decent company. Now it looks like they're trying to do a ""producers"" number and being the worst so they'll be happy to go out of business.1) I waited for years for an update. They had them but they never advertised them EVEN on their own website.2) Then after I called to ask why there wasn't any update, they said they were on version 3! I bought it and they charged my bank account TWICE!3) I then waited for at least 3 weeks to get it.4) I installed it and now in street routing, major highways on directions are just listed as blank spaces.5) I (tried) to call support and hung up after 2.5 hrs. on hold!Do NOT buy this product!!! I'm sure Garmin is a lot better and actually may WANT to succeed in business!"
1,VERY POORLY DESIGNED,This is the worst software I have ever purchased. Hard to use! hard to install! Ruins what is otherwise a good product - the Explorist 500. If you're trying to choose between Magellan and Garmin go with Garmin.
1,Don't buy this product! It does not work and support sucks,I purchased the GPS and both MapSend and BluvNav software. I have never been able to get Mapsend to work on Windows XP. Support is bad and could not help at all. I was able to get the software to run on a old laptop until the laptop died and now I can't use the software because it does not run on XP. I also have version 2 of the software and still it does not work on XP.Save your money and buy something else that works.
1,The Passover Plot--40th Anniversary,I wanted to read this as an after read of McCray's Betrayed series. The writing and the research are juvenile. The author references Bible without clarifying that the New Testament did not exist and thus the text would have been the Torah. His generalizations are so non-convincing. I was looking for a good story to make me think about my religion and found bad research
1,sent me wrong & cheaper items,"The seller has sent me the wrong items,which are two bottles of complexe5 with essential oils($42x2=$84) that are cheaper than the two bottles of complexe5 that I had paid for ($45x2=$90)."
5,The Napping House,"Great story, fantastic illustrations, love to read over and over with my children, it's like a new story each time"
5,top knotch big book,I use this book to teach my pre-k students reading using repetition. They can easily do shared reading the second time you read through the book.
2,"Great book, but didn't realise...","It's a lovely, beautiful book. I love Audrey and Don Wood, and do check out their other children's books. The illustrations are lovely and the writing is sweet and perfect for kids.BUT.Perhaps I misread, but I didn't realise that this specific copy was one of those small, cardboard, toddler's copies. I thought I was getting a pretty hardbacked copy instead, and thus was disappointed when the book arrived.Just make sure you know which book you're getting."
1,The Napping House,This book was given as a gift to me when I became a Grandmother for the first time. It is a wonderful book and the grandchildren enjoy having it read to them. The illustrations are beautiful.
5,Best book for baby shower gift!,"My children and I love to read this book - and the CD has beautiful music and an excellent oration of the book as well as other great things to listen to. Beautiful pictures, lots of details to spend time with - or you can just read this delightful book for pure enjoyment. I like to give it to new mothers as it's less popular than the typical book - and hopefully introduces the authors to new parents. I love this book!"
1,Absolute garbage!,"I got this little heater for my Eclipse System 6 quarantine tank. I knew going in that it was not fully submersible and didn't have a temperature setting. I figured that as long as I got the Hi/Low dial set to the correct position I would be ok. I mean, how often do you change the setting on a heater anyway?For several weeks I have been fighting with this heater, trying to get it set correctly. I have seen it off at 78 and on at 83 at the same Hi/Low setting.This heater is a waste of time and money. I will never buy another heater or any product by Aquatic Gardens ever again."
4,Excellent healthy snack,I found these to be a wonderful healthy snack. The flavor is very unique and robust. If you are one that gets bored with the traditional flavors than these snacks are for you.
2,well below average,"i purchased this vhs for the second,at least this one plays.very poor video.i hope it comes out on the dvd format."
3,good but grainy serial,"This Green Hornet serial is good and definitely not boring. The chapters to a ceratin extent are complete stories in themselves. Unfortunately, the film was no longer in good condition when tranferred to tape. This is what detracts from the full enjoyment of the serial. Many parts appear blurred and grainy. If the details were preserved, this product would rate 5 stars. The next Green Hornet serial was more enjoyable to watch as the original film appears to have been better preserved. But this is collector's stuff and secure one if you can."
2,This just doesn't rate for me...,"This Green Hornet serial is below average at best. The film wasn't in good condition when tranferred to tape; so, the poor quality detracted from my viewing. Whenever Hornet and Kato was in the scene, I found the ""hornet buzzing"" quite annoying after a while. As a baby boomer, I remember the Green Hornet of the late 60's (ala Van Williams and Bruce Lee, which I found myself on more than one occaision comparing this to. I know this isn't fair; but as a result, this one just didn't rate for me. I stop watching it after the 4th episode."
5,Naughty by Nature was on point with their debut in 91!,"I have to agree with the editor and his reasons why this is a classic album. Naughty by Nature put it down on their first album for sure. Trench was da man when he first came on the scene and Vinnie was a good sidekick who gave you quality verses. I know O.P.P was the standout track, but i favorite was Uptown Anthem. After that, i'd have to say O.P.P, Yoke The Joker, and Guard Your Grill came after that as personal favorites. Overall, it was a very good debut with very little flaws."
2,Nice Try,The intentions were probably good but anyone who knows Cozumel will know this is an attempt by the author to write a book on a subject she really knows very little about. Just so many errors--the guide is almost useless. It would be much better if we could get a guide written by a long time resident rather than this feable attempt. Save your money.
3,"Informative, but little guidance how to learn the technique","The title of the book had prompted me to buy it. I had some basic knowledge of the principles of the Alexander Technique and wanted to know more about it both in terms of depth of understanding as well as guidance on what to do. While the book provided a lot of good information on basic concepts it failed to address the one thing that I had bought it for: How to Learn the Alexander Technique. Instead, it kept referring to finding a teacher and learn from this person. I was disappointed about that because I would have liked to have more pointers for myself first and had wanted to try it out without help."
3,"Good if you have an Alexader specialist nearby, otherwise...","That's a very interesting book, where you can learn about the importance of knowing your body in order to know how to use it. It can be very helpful if you intend to take Alexander Technique lessons. I bought the book because I thought this was THE book where you can learn something about the technique without taking lessons. That is not the case. The main problem is that Alexander was a fantastic pioneer on the field of sommatics but did not have the conceptual skills to transform its fantastic intuitions in an easily explainable system. If you do not have an Alexander teacher nearby you you should try Feldenkrais book Awareness Through Movement book."
1,Not worth the reading.,The auther seems to think it more important to be witty and wordy then to try to convey information. The book was painful to read.
5,"A moving tale, written with a beautiful simplicity.","The Mud People describes the powerful and difficult journey of a young girl seeking to find the truth in her painful world. The story unfolds through her eyes, and the voice which is created as a result is innocent, honest, and very moving- for in her simplicity there lies a depth which speaks directly to the reader with heartfelt force. Laced with powerful imagery throughout, the tale quickly takes hold of the reader to usher them into the silent inner space where true pain and joy lie. Her journey of discovery and recovery is one which might spark hope in the hearts of us all."
5,I have never seen this movie,I wish I could say something great about this movie but I bought it as a gift for my dad. He says its a really good movie.
4,The Gene Krupa Story,Hello Dear Amazon ComThe commodity arrived safely though it took while it was a few. Thankyou.
5,Sal Shines In This Great Movie,Easily Sal Mineo's best movie role...what a guy! I wonder if he kissed good?...Handsome Harry From Honolulu
4,This was a Gift,"This movie was bought as a gift! I'm pretty sure that he liked it, as he has seen it before!"
5,Good Documentry movie. for it's time,"The Legend of Boggy Creek for it's time was a good movie it. this along with the TV Show In Search OF (with Lenord Nimoy) got me interested in the subject of Bigfoot and reading everything I could find on the subject.the way it was told and set up was well done had me shivering as a child.the two quotes from the Narrator: Fouke is a right nice place to live ... until the sun goes down.and ""I was a boy when I first heard him scream. It scared me then, and it scares me now.""still to this day at age 43, will still send a shiver down my spine they way he spoke thoes words.it is one of the best docu-drama/ Horror film on Bigfoot and a favorite of mine.No matter what your thoughts on if Bigfoot is real or not.you will enjoy this movie. I recommended it."
1,Horrible quality,"This DVD is horrible. It is clearly a bookleg copy, and not even a good one at that. Dont waste your time. I had high hopes of seeing a movie that scared me to death as a child. This looks like it was taped off TV and then converted to DVD."
5,widescreen or not fantastic,"Showing my age, I saw this when it first came out, again as a co-feature at a drive-in, and then on its re-release in 1976/1977. A great little cheapie B-movie, that use to scare me a bit too.I see where one person gave this one star, seemingly because it isn't in widescreen: I'm a widescreen fanatic too, but just having it on DVD is good enough for me. Widescreen would be great, particularly since I plan to get a widescreen TV, but...I've been to Fouke a couple of times, including just a couple of weeks ago. The folks out there are rather proud of their legend."
3,Delightfully amatuerish,"I can't say this was a really bad movie,yet I'm hesitant to say it was a really good one.I dont know the whole story behind this film,but it's very obvious that it was ""no budget"" and looks like it might have been filmed on a super-8 camera.With those handicaps(depending on your viewpoint,of course) in mind,I can see how it can be considered quite an accomplishment indeed.But that music...""Hey,Travis Crabtree"" and that song about the creature wondering if there's another monster out there for him to love...it's unintentionally hilarious.You can tell it was written in all seriousness,and I have the sneaking suspicion they were sung by the narrator (probably written by him as well).It makes it hard to take the movie seriously."
2,Not really worth it,"If I had to rate this album on only one of the tracks it would be number 6 and in that case it would get a 5 star rating. On the ""Bass in the Planet Mix"" we are given a treat from someone who is truly a standout in their field, Magic Mike. The other tracks are dry and out of touch with the traditional Planet Rock feel we are used to. I believe that Magic Mike almost takes the song to another level. 808 probably doesn't have any business touching this song nor do any of the other artists who serve up their humble offerings here. Of course, we are given the original version on the first track but outside of that the only other reason to buy this disc is Magic Mike's cut."
3,Swipes are ok,These so called swipes are ok but there must be a better way right? Through trial and error I find a medium tire brush works much better to apply tire dressing.
1,POS,"This came with the wrong bar.Once corrected (by Solo) i finally tried it- started very hard. Once it started it would not keep running. I finally returned it and bought a Stihl locally, like I should have in the first pace. Its great."
5,A single worth buying.,Normally singles come with very few benefits. This album for being mostly remixed Seven Pointed Star tracks is virtually an EP the song is so different each take. And Alien Love Song has always been one of my favorites. If you like older techno and psytrace this + the Seven Pointed Star album are good buys for sure.
1,Don't waste your money,"I first spotted this book in a local yarn shop, and dreamed about owning it for months before I finally picked it up with an Amazon gift certificate. Finally, a book with cool crochet patterns.Well, don't waste your cash. I'm an advanced crocheter. I've never met a pattern I couldn't do. I check my gauge before I begin and everything. The problem is not that I don't know how to read a pattern. The problem is that at least 3 of her patterns are wrong. And not slightly wrong, we're talking wrong for several steps throughout the pattern. I've talked to others who have bought this book and they've had the same trouble with the patterns I've tried thus far, and a couple of others in the book. If you want to pick up the book to be inspired, go for it. But if you are looking for a book that will tell you how to make those hip, funky creations pictured, look elsewhere."
3,too sci-fi,"I expected this book to be much more on the erotic side than the sci-fi. I thought it would be more focused on the master/slave relationships, mainly because I know many people out there have developed lifestyles based on Gorean culture. Maybe this book, as the first book of a very long series, had to set the scene and give a lot more background information than some of the later books. Anyway, as a non-reader of sci-fi, I found this book a little boring. However, it was very well-written, and if you do like sci-fi then you will most likely enjoy it. If you're looking for a more erotic read, then you might just want to try to skip right into a book further into the series."
3,Mr. Norman's very active fantasy life,"I started reading the gor novels in 1980 & read ALL that had been written to that point. In fact, being a science fiction reader anyhow, I read them back-to-back. I am also a rabid feminist(yeah, I belong to NOW!!)--but I found Norman's ideation fascinating. I would LOVE to ask the guy a few questions!That said, and feminist objections aside, these are marvelous, sword-swinging, in-your-face adventure stories, cleverly realized and full of detail. If a desert is the setting, Norman makes you taste the grit and feel the sand and heat. Total escapism. The male counterpart to the trashy romance genre! SO...hide those embarrassing covers and enjoy a good read. (But remember to put away the animal skins and slave manacles and act like a gentleman when you take your nose out of the books!"
5,The Greatest TV Show - EVER,"After reading this, you must buy the Wire and get 5 other people to buy the Wire. If you do not, you will have an incredible amount of bad luck come your way. Your dog will get sick, you'll lose your wallet, you'll trip and hurt your knee. Well, maybe not, but go get the Wire anyways and tell others to get it too because:- the plot and storylines are deeper than Atlantis- the dialogue and acting are precise and creative- you'll doubt if there really is hope for humanity"
1,Kindle bugs make my purchase useless,"I downloaded The Wire season 2. Apparently, it's quite good, but I wouldn't know as the second-rate Kindle Fire does NOT allow me to watch it without wifi. So even though it is downloaded I CANNOT watch it without wifi access. This is a well known problem that Amazon needs to fix."
4,It's not season 1 or 3 but check it out,"My title says it all. This is a truly amazing show and season two is fantastic. But if you've seen seasons 1 and 3 you might be a little disappointed with 2. I think stepping away from the social commentary the little bit that they did, along with focusing more on the Union guys instead of B&B was a little detrimental. I do have to say that watching McNulty destroy himself because he wasn't real Po-lice was fascinating, although I find it confusing that the step back he has taken in season 4 hasn't had similar results."
2,not good gramma,"His entire biography section in the beginning had numerous grammatical mistakes. It started bugging me so much I underlined every single one and sure enough, almost every page had one grammatical error. Very annoying.The rest was fine except how some of the reviewers mentioned that the author made it out to be an analysis of Ligeti's music. Rather it is more like he's talking about the background of the piece while touching only the surface of the actual music."
2,The Shadows:The Final Tour,"I'm disappointed that the casing was cracked on one side when i received the item , would like to remind Amazon to be more vigilant next time when handling the casing ,especially those boxed sets . I do not know how to get a replacement or maybe you can assist me on this case ."
4,"An intellectual toy, even though it doesn't appear as such","My (brainiac) daughter asked for this for her birthday, so I got it.She loves playing it with her equally brainiac brother, but honestly, I don't get the darn thing. It's kind of like Chess (which even that is a challenge for me) with laser beams.I know that she doesn't play it much any more (lack of intelligent players perhaps?), but it is a very cool game with a lot of strategy involved.If your kid is pretty smart, I'd say ""buy it"" and let the game help them grow intellectually. If it ends up sitting in the closet collecting dust, it's better than buying them a gift card to some type of ""ShopMart"" store where they'll blow their money."
3,I ended up having to pay for 2 :(,"I wanted ONE to give as a birthday present. I submitted my order. Then immediately afterward, realized I should have selected to have it shipped to the birthday girl's address instead of mine. So I cancelled the first one. Well, it came ANYWAY! (besides the one that went to the birthday girl). So rather than pay to ship back, I just kept it. Ugg.Other than that, the price was decent, cheaper than the retail stores."
5,Just what I expected.,I purchased this for a friend for Christmas. It was just what I would expect from the Demdaco Willow Tree collection. You can find the perfect figurine for any occasion. They make the perfect gift for the special someone and/or occasion.
5,This is THE woodturning book,"This is without question the best printed information for woodturning that I have encountered. This book, along with the companion volumes are a must have for beginner woodturners. It is very well illustrated throughout and the written descriptions are easily understood."
1,Worse than nothing,"About half a dozen times per week the APC Back-UPS raises a screeching alarm and the powered devices go down as though from a power loss. Funny, I thought the alarm was supposed to mean there was a loss in wall power and the Back-UPS was HELPING - - not that the wall power was fine and the Back-UPS had decided to shut off.Just as an experiment I took out the Back-Ups and just plugged direct to wall power for a week. Zero problems. Time to buy another brand of UPS . . ."
4,Fast Reading,"I read this book without having read the 2 previous books in the series. It was fairly easy catching up on who the characters were. One thing I found annoying is that during conversations, characters would bring up things that other characters had done throughout the book, but there seemed to be no relevence to the conversation. It is almost as if Miss Michaels was trying to remind the reader what had happened previously. It seemed unnecessary to me. I am, however, looking forward to reading Vegas Heat and Vegas Rich."
4,Great reference book,"This book is clear, precise and concise. It will teach you how to set and administer Apache easily. If you need answers here the author spelled them out. Also is the closest match to the current release (1.3.12) - Book covers (1.3.9).Highly recommended."
1,don`t waste your money for a printed docu,"i don`t what or who motivated the previous readers to rate this book such hight (probably you guess :)) ).anyway every apache distribution includes what`s this book made of: just a simple apache documentation. if you wan`t to pay 49 USD for a printing of the documentation, well your choice.i can absolutely not follow the previews reviews which let me buy this really disappointing book which is really not made for newbies to get an introduction in apache server.and if anybody might wonder my english is too bad to understand the book, don`t worry i usually prefer the english versions of any book."
3,I Wish it had been translated into English.,"A good read, if you can figure out what Andy is saying.Early in the book, he states that he was put in charge of his group.He states that he was ""chuffed"" about this.I thought that meant that he was angry, but as read more, I think it meant he was pleased.The book is full of words like this.I didn't think there was that big of a difference between American and British languages, but reading this book convinced me that there is.I would love to read this story after it had been translated into American."
4,Another look,"You might want to purchase ""the Real Bravo Two Zero"" by Michael Asher, also SAS. Raises some interesting questions about the contacts during their E&E;Real Bravo Two Zero"
2,Not at all what it seems,"It's not that it's badly written, it's that it seems to promise the glamour of explosions and such.Let me summarize this book:SAS men prepare, fly into Iraq, hunker down, get spotted, run around, shoot some people, get caught, get the snot beat out of them, go home.It's not their fault, and I'm not speaking about their personal performance in the real world, but there's no part of their mission they accomplished. I kept waiting for the exciting part.A total pass."
4,Top stuff - the hard reality of life behind enemy lines.,"A chilling account of an amazing, terrifying adventure, told with remarkable frankness and dark humour. A top read! I also strongly recommend ""The One That Got Away"" by Chris Ryan, for a slightly different yet equally entertaining version of the events of the Bravo Two Zero mission"
4,Good read!,"I enjoyed the book. It started a little slow for me and the British lingo was a little hard to follow at times but the story is real and the hell these guys went through was incredible. Definitely worth the read. Sadly, i don't remember the media talking about how the soldiers were tortured. Had they, maybe the Coalition forces would have been more supported and marched through Baghdad the first time we were there."
2,Spend your money elsewhere!,"I enjoyed it until i read the reviews and heard people saying thay McNab lied about half the story. How people can call their operation a succes lacks basic intelligence. 7 People either dead or captured is not a succses. They failed to complete all of their objectives which is a complete disaster. The fact that these are suposedly the premier elite unit of the world yet they were compromised by a young boy and then chased by three old men which McNab then lied about and said they killed 250 Iraqis and blew up some APCs. Also some people were saying in the reviews that people were guillible is a stupid thing to say because they had no way of knowing if the story was true or not. Id suggest buying "" The Real Bravo Two Zero"" first."
3,I wish it had been translated into English,"A good read, if you can figure out what Andy is saying.Early in the book, he states that he was put in charge of his group.He states that he was ""chuffed"" about this.I thought that meant that he was angry, but as read more, I think it meant he was pleased.The book is full of words like this.I didn't think there was that big of a difference between American and British languages, but reading this book convinced me that there is.I would love to read this story after it had been translated into American."
5,Non stop REAL action,This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It gives real credit to those that didn't make the nightly news. I have worked with the Brits before while deployed and this book gives me a whole new outlook on them. I salute the men of Bravo Two Zero and the rest of the Fighting Brits.
1,mainly good fiction!,"Yes, a lot of the book is based on fact but Mc Nab makes himself out to be a rambo for the sake of a good read! 250 iraqis killed, eh? Neat fiction.I'm amazed so many people are gullible enough to believe the guy. Read, 'The real bravo two zero' for an unbiased, accurate account of the mission if you're interested. Personaly,I think the author does his former regiment a massive disservice, and sullies the name of those who died, in order to make himself into some kind of 'hero.'Funny how the 'heroics' in his book aren't included in his offical debrief. The man is a joke among the SAS.How can the guy get away with it!? Don't waste your money!"
4,"A fine survey of Princeton's history, now badly out of date","The Princeton Companion was complied in 1978 in an attempt to be an encyclopedic guide to Princeton University. It has not been updated since, and thus is a bit behind on the times. It nonetheless remains one of the most concentrated sources of Princeton history and lore, even if occasionally marred by minor inaccuracies."
3,"Generally well done, though nothing extraordinary","This courtroom drama could have been called Hannibal Lite. Though nothing extraordinary, it's well done and enticing. Hopkins plays a brilliant engineer who, after brutally killing his adulterous wife, calmly waits for the police to arrest him. The cocky, young Deputy District Attorney (Ryan Gosling, in a fine performance as a quintessential yuppie) believes this would be an easy case to prosecute, but things don't turn out as expected, and a chilling battle of minds soon ensues. The denouement turns out to be quite disappointing (the filmmakers seem to believe that the audience would not stand a movie where the guilty get away with murder) but for most of its running time, this is a fine, well done thriller."
3,Good thriller...not an oscar film but fun,"This movie is enjoyable and while it won't have you guessing until the last (its easy enough to figure out) it is well acted and enjoyable all the same. The only thing that bothered me was Hopkins character had many many plans thought out to the last detail and I wondered how then, he could forget the obvious (I wont give detail to spoil it) but the answer is simple isn't it: This IS Hollywood."
5,Fracture,"Great movie, got here on time and in tact. No problem with sender. They even suggested other movies I may want to see. Completly satisfied."
5,Intelligent crime drama; great acting,Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling were outstanding in this thriller--it was nice to see Ryan Gosling grown up and that he's a great young actor whether playing a villian or good guy. Clever writing and a very intelligent criminal who is convinced he will get away with murder. Loved this movie and recommend it to people who enjoy thrillers.
4,Good,"Really interesting to watch this movie unfold. Good movie, believable characters and good performances. I would have paid to see this in the theater."
3,"Nice Actor's Showcase, But....","....where's the suspense? Marketed as a thriller, FRACTURE lays its cards on the table from the beginning; not many surprises in watching them played out, either. That said, the writing's literate and solid, the physical production handsome, the actors fine (no surprises there, either, given this cast). Ryan Gosling's one of the most interesting actors of his generation, and he invests his lawyer-on-the-make with fascinating quirks and complexity. Pity Embeth Davidtz, always an interesting actress, has come to three scenes, then a coma this early in her career; nice chance here for Rosamund Pike, though. Pleasant enough Saturday night rental, but nothing spectacular."
2,"Very Suspenseful, did not like the ending","This movie was suspenseful and seemed to keep my attention on it but the ending just did not seem to fit well. Since in my opinion an ending can make or break a movie, it in my opinion it really broke this movie. I believe the extra features contain an alternative ending but it did not differ much from the original. I am not a big Anthony Hopkins fan but really played his role well here. Maybe a more appropriate ending could have made this movie really good. If you like movies with suspense then check-it out since some people might find the ending ok.Peter J. Miller"
2,"Contrived, sub-standard mystery","A wealthy engineer (Anthony Hopkins) murders his philandering wife (Embeth Davidtz), confessing the fact to the arresting officer (Billy Burke), who just happens to be the man with whom she was cheating. Enter Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), an assistant district attorney who is about to sign on with a major law firm and has agreed to prosecute this slam-dunk case on his way out the door. Obviously, things turn out to be less cut and dried than he thought.This mystery holds interest for a while, but the resolution reveals how contrived it all is. The success of the murder plot depends on something that couldn't be anticipated. Gosling is annoying in this role, doing most of his acting with his hands. Most of the attempts at humor fall flat."
2,What a disappointment!,"It's hard to know where to begin in describing this cliche-fest. Is the star Anthony Hopkins or the L.A. skyline? Is Ryan Gosling's agent the producer? The only high points were when Anthony Hopkins is on screen. The rest of the time we seem to be looking at Mr. Gosling's not very distinguished profile. Plot? Yes, there were a few highlights, but for the most part it was a snoozer. I was actually angry at this overhyped ripoff."
3,"GREGORY HOBLIT, OPUS 5","*** 2007. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. An ambitious assistant D.A. tries to convict Anthony Hopkins who murdered his adulterous wife but the old man planned everything. Average courtroom thriller with a messed up ending. I liked a lot, though, the first two movies directed by Gregory HoblitPrimal Fearand above allFallenwith their disturbing mood. Too bad !"
3,"3.5, Ok, But Not Great.","Hopkins is a great actor and can always pull off any character he plays. The story line was too weak. It had the potential to be a good suspenseful story, but lacked enough substance. It was ok for a rental. I wouldn't buy this movie."
4,solid disc,this group was interesting in that they were rappers&singers but for me they were far better singers.Love is a house was my jam.tender Love was cool but it's been played to death.still overall this is a solid disc.the vocals&the music still sound good.
4,Out of place tracks,"For some reason the track called ""Lock Me Up"" is actually XP8's Cuttin'n'Drinkin (Grendel Remix). I dont know whos work on this CD is actually LOE's but i dont see any credit going to XP8 for this song."
2,"poor as a whole, good in fragments","with so many guest vocalists, I almost couldnt tell this was a LOE album. After many times perusing through this cd, I came to the conclusion that it is better as almost performance art, rather than a complete album. Certain tracks have brilliant patterns of programming, they just stretch out to the point where it sickens you to hear it any more. You want it to go somewhere, but it just doesnt. But I still have it, and although It isnt their best work, I lost no respect for the groups need for alternate avenues of expression. It was definately a surprise, and I like that, though I may have not loved the album."
5,Love this movie!,"I just adore this movie...it's one of those movies you can watch over and over. It's a cute story and even though I really don't like Hillary Duff, I love her in A Cinderella Story. Definitely a great spin on the whole cinderella thing."
4,Modern and Cute,"I thought this film was cute. Hilary Duff added some fairy-tale charm to this modern re-make. I think the film was a bit too predictable, but It had funny parts, sad parts and a lot of cheesy parts, but overall, a great family film, perfect for girly sleepovers"
4,"Soothing, sultry downtempo jazz!","Excellent fusion of jazz, downtempo and sultry vocals. Especially recommended for lovers of downtempo electronica drum and bass music. Great listen for a lazy cool Sunday morning or a cuddle with your loved one!"
5,Makes learning easy..,"This book doesnt baby you, its simple and can be easy if you apply yourself and it comes with its own builder software (make sure the book you get has the disk or you are screwed!! you need it to do the work).. you will not be disappointed!"
2,Just another sales book.,"The book is well written and easy to follow, but it is relatively generic. I believe it to be a little over priced for its content."
3,IT'S OKAY,"The way it's billed, you think Fantasia and Faith Evans have the starring roles. In actuality, they have a few lines and one song each. They just have the most recognizable names. Otherwise, it is a mediocre, but entertaining production. The acting is average to substandard, but good for a group of mostly singers. I'm glad I purchased it as support to the cast."
2,A bit out-dated and boring,"It is one of the few books specifically on corporate governance in Asia. The writer put in a lot of reference materials but it will be a challenge for him to keep them updated given that (i) this book was first published in 2005 and (ii) a lot of new development frequently in this area.If we take it as a 'business' book, the writer does not seem to be able to make it an interesting topic. (By the way, the font size is far too small.)If we take it as a reference book, it will not be able to keep it current.For those readers looking for books in corporate governance, I will recommend those by Professor Robert Ian Tricker who manage to deliver his messages in an inspiring way."
1,"oh , livro chato...","Sinceramente , no recomendo ! A leitura é maante , os persongens so deslocados ... enfim! mesmo assim , quem quizer conferir , no Brasil chama-se 'Precisa-se de reparos ' e foi lanado pela Nova Cultural."
5,Amazing!,"The best multi out there. Great numbers! I haven't got sick since starting taking it! It tastes good, not too sweet-perfect!"
5,Great alternative to a whole lot of vitamin bottles...,I ordered Source of Life because I wanted to try a liquid instead of having to deal with so many bottles of different vitmains and minerals.I dont' have to swallow so many pills...just one cap full of the liquid!This is simple and it tastes great. I don't have anything negative to say about this product except that it does advertise to be a 32 0z. bottle. My bottle is a 30 oz. size. But compared to other places this is the best price for the Source of Life. I can tell a difference in energy level. It is a good product.
3,NO Liquid Vitamins - Changed My Mind!,"I first used this product when I forgot my multi vitamins on a trip to SF. Tried this for 2 years, then researched & found that JUICE PLUS+ nutraceuticals work much better. JP+ is not a vitamin, it's raw food with more than 10,000 micronutrients. Man-made vitamins can't possibly reproduce what nature has to offer."
1,The worst taste EVER,This could potentially be a very good vitamin however I could not stand the taste! It literally tasted like I popped a regular multi-vitamin pill in my mouth and chewed it up! Add to that the thick green appearance and I simply could not take it! My husband tried to take it because he didn't want to waste the money however he quickly found that no amount of money could get him to take this stuff! STAY AWAY! Buy Centrum Liquid vitamins instead -- still a little gross tasting (but honestly what vitamin isn't?) but at least its palatable and 1/3 of the price!
5,Fun for all ages,"We purchased this Memory game as a birthday gift for our 4 year old and have played it EVERY day for at least 3 weeks. This classic game never grows old. EeBoo has done such a fantastic job creating beautiful and extremely durable cards. They are thicker than other Memory games we have owned so I predict they will last much longer. Our entire family-- mom, dad, and five children from 13 to 4, have enjoyed playing this game."
4,"Rich with flowing spirit, a gentle and evocative vision.","I bought Shelley Snow's CD Shamaneya about a year or so ago and I love it! Though reminiscent of Loreena McKennit and Enya, I like that Shelley is courageous enough to do her own thing. Her music is deep, flowing and gentle. Her own language richly evocative. With each song I am carried through feeling worlds, places I need to go to. I find she is borrowing from rich traditions, the use of music as an important conveyor of her vision as an artist while also being delightful to listen to, and borrowing from women's traditions such as Jodi Foster's 'Nell', a gentle intuitive wildness in us all that needs to be expressed in the world. I think this album is for anyone ready to explore these worlds through this gentle muse, and is for anyone who wants to connect and be carried by the soft, gentle flow. Calming and inspiring."
3,Rincewind romps through History,"The fake title (Faust) says it all. The inept ""wizard"" Eric tries to summon a demon and accidentally pulls Rincewind back from the Dungeon Dimesions. I admit that the main purpose is to bring back Rincewind. And the story is very short - but there really is only one thread. The best points in the story are the parts about hell (funny place) and about the take off on the Trojan War (especially Lavaeolus, the ""rincer of winds""). Get the book at the library and read it: you won't be disappointed. And if you are, it's short and over quickly. I still say that the part about Lavaeolus is worth it by itself. It's always funny to read about Rincewind and his ancestors (or most anything else about him)."
3,A good eRead,"I'm a fan of Terry Pratchett and this is a good Rincewind romp. This particular Kindle version is the first one (for me in my limited experience) where the footnotes really work properly. It may be because I'm reading it on a Kindle Fire and not the Kindle DX -- whatever, access to the footnotes and then back to the regular text is excellent. All Terry Pratchett readers know the footnotes are fun. Don't think anyone will be disappointed with this purchase."
3,Not a good introduction to Pratchett,"I thought this book was simply okay. There are some definite laugh-out-loud moments, but it's not one of Pratchett's best books. I found it worth the read, but if I were introducing someone to Pratchett for the first time, I would most likely go with something else."
4,A peek at the genius of Disney animation--Mickey Mouse genre,"I was facinated as the artist/author gave me a glimpse into the style and technique that Walt Disney and his crew of animators developed to create Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, et al. It was really ground-breaking stuff in its day. Explained well; illustrated well."
4,Go Back To Dru Hill,"I have purchased both CD's and I must say that I was very disappointed with the overall performance of Sisqo's second release,""The Return Of Dragon"". First of all,the CD is too short and I can not follow his chain of thought. What is the`purpose of this album? What is he trying to say? It appears to me that he is trying to include a little of everything into this album. He begins by first paying hommage to himself. This is totally unnecessary. Please don't misunderstand me, I enjoy Sisqo and I think that he is very talented. But a word of advice,""Go back to DruHill while you are still on top"". If you wait to long before you decide to get back with the guys and release the long awaited DruHill album, you might just find yourself walking down the ""HALL OF SHAME""."
4,The Return for Ya'll Azz,"The song that made me know this Cd was going to hot was ""Can I Live"" featuring The Dragon Family(Lovher&The Associates) and The hit for this summer ""Dance 4 Me"". The production on this Cd is so hot like the first Cd but more intense, more hype and still keep it real for the men. Homewrecker is a good example of this.The slow songs are ""Without You"" featuring Dru Hill,""Dream"" featuring Chinky of his group Lovher and ""Close Your Eyes"". ""Off the corner"" introduces his new rap group ""The Associates"" they are straight for now, a whole album we will see. The flow on ""Can I live"" was straight. He follows the same formula as the last album but the first 2 songs are okay could have been left off. Pick this one up. One of the best of 2001."
5,The Dragon Returns,I have to say Sisqo has done it again and I am so proud of him :) This CD is the bomb Yall need to get this You will be dancing your lil behinds off lol Nah but for real He did a good job and I hope he goes Quadruple Plat One Luv :-) Much Luv to Sisqo
5,even better than unleash the dragon,"Unleash the dragon was a good album, but this one is a solid album. There are no filler tracks, and it's filled with classic dance rhythm combined with booty shaking sex, but in a classy, musical way that the artists today can only wish to accomplish. Sisqo could also sing and dance great. Definitely check this out and don't write off sisqo for the overplayed Thong Song."
2,Dragon With No Flame,"There were no noteworthy tracks on this CD. I was really disappointed. You quickly get tired of all the ranting about ""The Dragon"". He does a lot of that half talk half rap (Survivor type) thing on here. The last track is the only one where he truly sings. He's got some seriously corny interludes including one where he says he's going to perform over the phone, but then let some mediocre rappers rap the rest of the song."
2,dissapointment at its best,"THIS ALBUM MADE ME MAD, I EXPECTED BETTER AFTER HIS FIRST, SOME SONGS ARE AIGHT BUT OVERALL, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY......"
1,Just as I expected,'Thong Song' was this man's claim to fame...the 'Dragon' should not have returned..he should have stayed at home. The album is solid throw away material. Buyer beware.
1,Sisqo returns. It's a pity he forgot to bring his talent.,"Sisqo has apparently run out of talent. Just listen to beats like those on tracks like Can i Live and Last Night; inconsistent, unoriginal and chaotic, all accompanied by Sisqo's whiny smart-mouth. The lack of vocal talent displayed here is even more evident when comparing this cd to his early work with dru hill."
4,litter trays are here to stay,"I have arthritis and it became very painful for me to scoop my cat's litter tray. I bought the automatic litter box from ScoopFree and it has been wonderful for me and probably for my cat, too. It didn't take him long to get used to it and he is so fascinated when it begins the sifting process that he goes over to watch it.My only complaint is that supposedly the trays will last for weeks if you only have one cat. Sorry to say that mine will only last a week before it has to be replaced. It is a bit expensive but for me it is worth it."
5,Awww. Finally! No Smell!,"This is a great product. I thought the litter looked weird at first...but it does the job!It absorbs the smell of my cats' ""business"" within minutes of him going. I highly recommend spending the money on the litter box....because it really does stop all odors! And believe me...I've tried everything!I will be ordering this product again and hope you all out there give it try."
4,"Low maintenance, but it smells","I love not having to scoop, but after around 2 weeks the litter starts to smell a bit, mainly because my cat directs herself to one area in the box. I add in some extra crystals from the store to help stretch it out to 3 weeks. I've never had a problem with any sort of leakage.A bit of advice: Make sure you use strong garbage bags when disposing of the litter in its box. The corners can poke a hole through the bag easily while you're carrying it to the garbage dumpster."
3,crystal litter,I also have the forever litter tray which works really well. I have two cats who use it. But the thing I absolutely dislike is the odor of the crystals. It is supposed to last for at least a week or two with 2 cats but after a few days I have to dump it and renew it which gets expensive. Has anyone tried a different litter for the same tray? I am looking for ANY other litter that can be used with this system that does not stink this bad after just a few days.
4,Scoop Free Cat Litter,"I have two Scoop Free systems ( four cats) The refill cartridges are definitely on the expensive side. However, it has made my life easier in terms of cleaning litter boxes."
2,Scoop Free Litter Box,"So far this has been the best litter box I have purchased. Only down fall is have 4 cats and litter trays are too expensive they need to be replaced about once a week. We have tried to clean out our selves to prolong changing doesn't really work though, also have tried just buying the bag of litter and that is also very expensive and hard to find. Plus side no one really knows there are cats in the house."
5,Love the new litter system,"We are very happy with the new system. The refills are a bit pricey, but Amazon price beats even the manufacturer's website price, plus they give you free shipping. We buy a case of six at a time. We have two cats, so my husband scoops the solid waste tray after about two weeks so that it doesn't fill up. It is so much nicer than traditional litter. My two used it the very first day. I kept their old litter box because I had read that some cats take time to adjust. They never used the old one. Right after we set it up, we hit the power button to make sure it worked and the cats came running to watch. After it finished they jumped in to check it out and then used it from that day. I would no sooner give it up than I would give up my computer for a typewriter. Why go back once you have upgraded to the best in new technology?"
3,Bad batch?,"I just ordered my 3rd set of refills. My 1st set worked great, my 2nd set had problems - something with the glue at the box-end seemed to get stuck so the grate would get jammed and actually PULL poop out of the trap. It wasn't just 1 refill out of the box but 3 or 4 according to my daughter. I guess I'll decide (best 2 out of 3) before I give up on this. It is not a cheap solution and not exactly something you can return. I don't know if there's anything that can be done! Just be aware that you should check the functioning of the unit EVERY day before it gets out-of-control! And, we replace these every 15 days like clockwork so $1/day for not having to scoop at all seems like a reasonable deal."
5,Easy and clean,I've been using this product ever since I've had my cat- probably three or four years- and I like it so much I bought another for our vacation house. It's a bit more of an investment but it's worth it to not have to clean a litter box every day. The house doesn't smell and the box is covered so the litter doesn't end up all over the floor. I love it!
4,Strangely and immediately irresistable to my cats.,"Scoop Free LB1 Self-Cleaning Litter BoxMy cats are large - just not Maine Coon large. As far as ordinary domestic cat size, two of my five cats are large. And consequently, I go through the cartridges faster than 2/15 days. Even so, I rate this highly because my cats immediately adapted to using this system without *mistakes.* There is *no* odor or fragrance! I also discovered great relief in ridding my house and myself of the heavy bags of litter and the scattering messes I, the cats, and the hole-y bags had always made.I would change my review to 5 of 5 stars if Amazon allowed at this time."
1,Product is good...shipment was incorrect and I somehow lost money on a return order,"I order this product on a subscribe and save basis. Until this order, I had never had any issues. This shipment came with only one tray refill (there are supposed to be six). I returned the product and was issued a refund, or so I thought. Today I received an email stating that I am being charged for the product I supposedly did not return (I did, and it's listed as such on my account). I normally do not comment on products, and I have always been fairly lenient when it comes to orders. I know that things happen. The product itself is good, but I cannot rationalize how i owe almost eighty dollars for a return order that was not correct in the first place."
2,Not water tight,"Even with the lid under the tray, both get really soggy after just a few uses (before its ready to be changed out). I've had to put a pan liner under it to keep from getting the floor wet."
4,Convenient Part of Scoop Free System / A Bit Pricey,"While these are quite expensive, I felt that Amazon had the best price on the 6 Pack. With one cat I was getting about a months worth of use from each tray. Now with two cats, I get two to two and a half weeks per tray. I fell that they are just a little stingy with the crystals. I keep a bag of extra crystal litter handy to top off, especially as the cats walk off a bit of the litter.The whole Scoop Free System is great. Using the Trays is easy and quick. The only awkward part of use is getting top of the tray, which is stored under it while in use, off the bottom of the full used tray to put it on the top for disposal. I suppose one could keep the top stored instead of putting it under the tray. But, then the user would not have that added security layer of cardboard under the tray during use. I give 4 stars, instead of 5, due to the expense of use."
4,Kitty litter made simple,Having the kitty litter inserts make having a house cat so much more enjoyable now that the chore of scooping kitty poo is gone.
4,Pretty good.,"I was worried my cat wouldn't take to the new litter, but he had no issues. This seems to work better than Litter Maid. We have a very large cat and LitterMaid would always get stuck and filled up so quickly. We have had this for 3 months so far, and so far we haven't had any problems. The litter seems to last between 2 and 3 weeks for our large cat. I can extend it a little by putting in some fresh litter on top.All in all, this has been a pretty good product."
3,slick little knife but i wouldnt get one again,"im used to carrying larger knives, kershaw, cold steel, This is a decent little knife if you want small and light. the lockup is negligble, the lock is annoting and the opening/closing is argh... id personally go with a ckrt or a kershaw.(have a ckrt on the way, loved my kershaw ken onions(leek, scallion, shallot, chive) they were all great knives and im sure the were in the same price range.."
1,Great letter opener.,"My wife is a poet. She said it was a small knife. Had I seen it in front of me, I wouldn't have bought it. Appears very flimsy and cheap.Nothing against SOG, rather this model, Flash I. Caveat emptor."
3,A Little Small for a Big Price,"I did not realize that the knife would be so small. I am getting ready for a deployment and most military soldiers recommend the SOG brand knives, but they are really small (short) I was not expecting that."
2,Nice little knife but some quality issues,"I purchased this knife for a small EDC role. I like the size and the fact it is so lightweight. It also has a great pocket clip that allows the knife to ride deep in your pocket. That said, I returned it because the arc lock (main lock) was so loose it rattled a ridiculous amount. It also rattled when the blade was deployed although not nearly as much. I have read where other people have had this issue as well. I will probably buy a Buck Vantage Select Small or Ka-Bar Mini Dozier instead."
3,Flannery O'Connor's novel comes to the big screen,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmWise Blood is a film based on the Flannery O'Connor novel of the same name.It is about a man returning home after military service to find his home abandoned and his family gone. He then goes into town and eventually sets up a ""Church without Christ.""The film is pretty much a faithful adaptation of the novel and was influenced much by O'Connor's Catholic faith.The acting is good and Brad Dourif does a very convincing Southern accent and his voice and mannerisms reminded me much of Connor Trinneer's acting Trip Tucker in the TV series, Star Trek Enterprise.The supplements are also good. The DVD includes a theatrical trailer, an audio segment of Flannery O'Connor reading her short story, ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"", an episode of Bill Moyer' PBS program which interviews director John Huston, and interviews with cast and crew."
1,Not Compatible with HP Color Laserjet CP2025,"Despite reviewer/company info stating this memory should work with my new HP Color LaserJet CP2025, I had no success. I even returned the memory and obtained another one directly from EDGE. When installed, the printer refused to boot up and was not able to be found on the network. Removal of the memory had things back to normal. Updating the printer's drivers and system had no effect. Don't count on finding any memory to expand the memory in this printer."
3,"A little contrived, yet good.","I like this album, but I get the hint that she spends a little too much time trying to be like Lauren Hill. If you buy this album thinking you'll get singing like her single the life then you're in for a rude awakening becuase she raps on the whole album. The album is cool,but I wasn't wowed to disbelief like I was hyped up to be."
1,This is not a RED poison frog. It is pink so my grandson would not accept it.,"Someone there is color blind as this is a PINK frog, not a red frog. My grandson would not even touch it as he has a little sister. Someone needs some art lessons on basic colors of RED, BLUE, and YELLOW. Hope they get sent back and these people have to eat these ""RED POISON DART FROGS""!!"
2,barely adequate,"Pictorally this book is attractive but in substance it is lacking. The material was perhaps on a elementary level and I was looking for far more detail concerning parts of the plants, the leaves, the flower, seed, etc. I believe the word ""essential"" may mean different things depending on the purpose for reading the book. For my purposes which was for teaching, I needed more detail, more information."
4,the master of naturalism,"The book consists of five stories.Especially the first three are so heartrending.The Lost Phoebe;the third story,is one of the most poignant and touching stories I have ever read.Being a naturalist,Dreiser's stylie is sometimes rather intricate and you may have to struggle with ambigious sentences,but it delves into human spirit deeply.At the very beginning Sherwood Anderson gives an introduction to the stories praising Dreiser's works.I guess it is a book worth reading."
5,THIS LIVE ALBUM WILL MELT YOUR CD PLAYER,"Plan and simple one of the greatest live rock records ever!! Train Train and Highwaysong are blistering, Rick, Greg ,Jakson and Charlie PLEASE REUNITE FOR ONE LAST TOUR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Review,"For baby #3, I decided I wanted to look for a Christian-based record book. This one looked most appealing online, and had plenty of good reviews. When it arrived, I scanned through it and was happy with it. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there were a lot of quotes by various authors in place of where I thought scripture verses would have been much better. It also listed a page for ""First Day of Preschool,"" which I thought was funny because it is assuming that most children go to preschool. (Mine will NOT!) Overall, I felt it was a secular book with a couple references to God thrown in there. I DID like that there was plenty of room for birthday entries, 2 pages per birthday, with room for 3 pictures each, up to the 5th birthday."
2,"Mostly works, but unforgivable failures",The mouse is 99% good. The keyboard sometimes locks up and spews whatever the last keypress was. The media controls keep getting in the way. A company with this much experience should be doing better than this.
1,I hate this thing and I really hate what I paid for it!!!,"I am constantly watching Logitech's site for software updates. This thing is a piece of junk as is. I recommend an old-fashioned balled mouse with an inch of dust on the inner rollers over this thing. My mouse floats all over the place. My precision tolerance is about a half and inch on the screen. One software update has been released for it, and I swear it made the thing worse. Bluetooth connectivity went to pot. The LCD screen on the keyboard now works sometimes, and those repetative kkkkkeystrokes are painfully annoying. Don't buy it... unless you want to buy mine!!!! (I'll make you a real deal!)"
2,Flaky,"I had a wireless keyboard before and have never had such connection issues. Currently the keyboard will not reconnect after the computer restarts after going in standby. This has not always been the case, but there has always been some connection issue and it can be 10 minutes and numerous power cycles of the keyboard until it gets resolved. The hardware reliability has been poor too. The keyboard had a sticky key and they sent me a new keyboard and mouse. I was thrilled with the second mouse until it failed within a few weeks. I dislike having to recharge it every couple days, I preferred replacing batteries a couple times a year. The mouse does work great though and the keyboard has a neat calculator feature. The shortcut keys on the keyboard are nice too, although the volume and zoom control are not useful to me."
1,Thanks for nothing Logitech,"Unlike many other reviewers I've actually been able to get the mouse and keyboard to work (probably because there's no more then 3 feet between the BT dongle and my desk) but I just can't get the SetPoint software to recognize that anything is there. And without SetPoint none of the extra keys work. In fact, without SetPoint functioning properly you can't even so much as adjust the mouse speed.Since Logitech's BT implementation can't even recognize it's own compontents it goes without saying it won't recognize anything else e.g. a bluetooth cell phone.Now, there may in fact be a simple solution to this problem. If you haunt Logitech's forums there's certainly many, many people with similar problems.... but nowhere on Logitech's site is there any recognition that a problem of this nature exists, let alone a solution.I'll give this another day or so before I return this... but there's no compensation for the hours of frustration spent struggling with Logitech's mess."
1,"Bluetooth? Should be ""White Fang""","I concur with many other reviewers that this is a piece of garbage. The keyboard is the problem. I couldn't keep mine connected and the poor thing ended up in pieces on the floor of my office. I've gone back to a wired Keyboard and Laser Mouse from Microsoft. Plus Logitech loads utilities and tools that are always popping up on screen asking you if you want to upgrade. Nonsense. It's a keyboard for crying out loud. I want to type on it, not solve World Hunger. These manufacturers need to stay away from the volume controls and hot keys and make a keyboard that types like it should."
5,Fantastic,"Logic has really out done themselves this time , I must admit I was very impress with the layout and the functionality of the keyboard."
4,Another great German memoir,"What a great read. This is a superbly done memoir that I found to be interresting, informative, humbling and fascinating. It ranks among the best I have read (in my personal opinion) about the German soldier in WW2. I do agree with a previous reader that a lack of photos and maps keeps me from giving it a 5. However, compared to SS Panzergrenadier (a bunch of crap), Adventures in my Youth is absoutely worth the time. Thank you, Armin, for leaving us this narrative."
4,Must Reading,"This is the story of a Dutch boy of 17 who is drafted into Hitler's Army. He is chosen to be an officer. The book covers his duties as a platoon leader,a company commander,and a battalion commander.He is wounded,survives the war and spends a number of years after the war as a prisoner of war.It is one of the best Kindle books I purchased at Amazon.com."
3,"Salvation, the product , not the desire.","Very well researched and written. If you like well documented historical Christian works this is a good book.I would differ with the author on this one important point though! Had the book been written with this point in mind I would have given it a five. The author says in his opening statements, 'the central doctrine of the Bible is the message of salvation'. I believe that is wrong. The central message of the Bible is 'Christ'. When we find Jesus we find salvation and all the other benefits of 'knowing Him'. If we focus stricly on salvation then our focus is off. Jesus Christ must be the center from which everything else flows."
1,Caution! Melodramatic curves ahead.,"It's pretentious. It's portentous. It's purple prose. At least these P words were my reaction to the first half of the book. When I slam-dunked it into the waste basket, I didn't even care if the last half redeemed the broody navel-inspecting melodrama of the first half. The beginning, though was deceptively intriguing. I wish I'd been warned"
3,A good beach book,"Craig Nova, in The Universal Donor, is good at style, good at moving the story along, good at entertaining the easily entertained. But I found the book to be mildly disappointing. Being primarily a non-fiction reader, what fiction I do read I want to be better than Crichton or Clancy or Koontz. This wasn't. The police scenes were ludicrous, Number two was a joke. Sadly, it's a beach book. I expected more. I don't fault Nova, he's good at what he does. I blame the reviewers, who should be forced to include the acronym RLAMS (Reads Like A Movie Script), where appropriate, as a public service"
4,Good for the little art kid!,"Works well, attaches to my SUV (Honda Pilot) fine. Sits pefectly in her lap...she sits in a car seat."
4,Great pouch,This pouch is almost perfect for the Magellan crossover GPS. it's lightweight and the unit fits snugly inside of it. I only wish it were designed to hold the crossover with the wrap around rubber sealer.
1,Unnecessary duplicate of case included with the Crossover GPS,"This pouchMagellan 980905 Protective Pouch for RoadMate 2000/ 2200T/ and Crossover GPSprovides the same function as the pouch that comes with the Crossover GPS.Magellan Crossover 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Road and Trail NavigatorIt is completely unnecessary. Don't waste your money.

As it is, it is completely useless because the Crossover comes with a similar pouch."
2,"Great, but a bad translation.","Augustine's Confessions is one of the greatest books ever, but this is a terrible translation. There are far better versions out there you can find at the same price, or even lower."
2,Not that Great,"I'm a jerky maker and I've had 3 Gardenmasters(Original) This unit does not dry as well as the first. Maybe because heat rises and it naturally works better. The concept is good because the original unit rusts out because of any marinades used, drops downinto the unit. I do not reccomend this product!"
2,"Sorry, no matching products were found.","I was interested in FD-1020, because of the timer feature. But, after looking at Nesco's web site there is no FD-1020. Only a FD-1010, and it does not have a timer. :("
2,Quality Problems!,"We bought this high end product based on good reviews. What a disappointment! When we dried prune plums from our trees, at a medium temperature, it melted the top two trays. The melted trays had to be tossed, and as I sit here and look at it, five of 12 trays warped enough to let air flow out the sides instead of all the way through the trays and out the bottom. I just dried some pie cherries from the freezer and due to the air flow, they came out very unevenly dried."
3,Good to a point,I liked this for jerky when I was doing small batches (6 trays) but when adding more trays the drying was very uneven with the bottom trays not done and the top finished. Just feeling the outside of the trays it was obvious all the heatvwas at the top.Despite what they say don't expect good results with more than four or six trays. Also he Nesco website no longer lists this model....maybe for a reason.
5,Navy beans without Bisphenal A,"This is a great product, healthy, low sodium, great taste... from the only manufacturer in the US which does not use cans lined with a Bisphenol A epoxy.None of the other ""Organic"" suppliers bother to use packaging without BPATry their garbanzo beans and black beans as well!"
5,From Total War to Total Diplomacy: The Advertising Council and the Construction of the Cold War Consensus,QUICK SHIPPINNG NICE DEAL!IT IS A NICE PURCHASING EXPERIENCE WIHT AN OVERSEA DEALER!GOOD DEAL! I WANT TO INTRODUCE OTHERS TO AMAZON!
3,CAUTION! Be Sure this is the Disc you want,"By the price it should be obvious that this is a single DVD edition of the Monterey Pop Festival at $27.99, and not the 3 disc $70.00 edition as reviewed previously. Nonetheless, it is well worth the price for a 78 minute cross section of what happened in that ""summer of love"". If you want all 280 minutes of the festival, be sure you get that 3 DVD set. Its well worth it!"
5,It Rocks,I would have wished a better mix of music but it was a fun stroll down memory lane for me and my old geezer friends
5,Definitive history of Codebreaking in WWII,"Unquestionably the finest general history of codebreaking in the Second World War. This comprehensive, well-researched and well-balanced treatment is particularly valuable for its account of the US contribution to the codebreaking war. Everyone interested in cryptanalysis or the history of the Second World War should read this book."
2,Version of 1950,"If you liked the 1950 versions of Pearl Harbor and United States code breaking, you'll love this book. Give it a two for excellent copy-cat-ism."
1,More Split Season Nonsense,"Have not and will not buy...One dud star for Paramount...Any insight/feedback regarding the company DVD Media Star and their product listing (or any of their DVD listings for that matter) for the Complete Gunsmoke Collection would be welcome. Supposedly all 20 seasons/635 uncut episodes are available on 99 DVDs for $187.95. Seems this would have ""bootleg"" written all over it; chopped up, poor quality etc., etc...""a disaster on disc(s).""?! The link is below.http://www.dvdmediastar.com/product.php?productid=813344&cat;=0&page;=1"
4,great show. bad release order,i like the one season per dvd but they are releasing the seasons way to slow & too expensive.[...]
4,The Best of Peggy Lee-The Capitol Years,"This was a nice trip down memory lane. She was always a great singer, and it was a delight to hear her voice once again."
4,Capitol Years Shines,"Get this CD and put on ""Fever"" and ""See See Rider"". Those two songs alone will school you. Peggy Lee can smolder! I got this CD even though I had most of the songs on it from other compilations. The one song that I wanted was ""See See Rider"". Peggy Lee can be sexy without being tawdry, and she can maintain the mood throughout the entire arrangement. You just don't listen, you get drawn into the selection. How does she do it, and why can't so many other singers even come close to her restrained emotion and passion? I don't know. She is one of a kind and if you like singers with class and raw talent, with a generous helping of technique and magic, then this is the lady for you. Give ""Fever"" and ""See See Rider"" a whirl and see if you don't agree."
2,Egotism Unleashed,"While Dylan Thomas commands accolades for his poetry, I found his prose to be murky and confusing. I was expecting so much more."
4,"Hrmm.. now for a real review, i guess.","Despite the previous review, I'll review this one. ;) It's a pretty nice mix, featuring the likes of Underworld and Orbital, for those of you like like the names dropped. It's not as continuous and consistent as some of the other mixes I've had the pleasure of enjoying, but throwin on some beats you can get into some of the time has never been easier. Decent mix."
5,AMERICAN ECONOMY REEL MOWER,"This is a great lawn mower. It is easy to use and requires no maintenance. My front yard has a steep slope, and this lawn mower is light enough to push up the hill. The cut is great, and doesn't leave clippings floating on top. The only issue you may run into is if you let your grass grow above ankle high... it will be a struggle, but the little guy will still be able to cut it down."
5,Great reel mower,"This is perfect if you don't want to deal with the hassle of a power mower or an electric mower. Be kind to the environment and have extra room in your garage or shed with this product. Two minor bad things: 1. it's noisy 2. one cannot tell where he/she has mowed because there are no track lines, so you may mow over an area more than once. It takes slightly longer to mow the lawn with this reel mower."
4,pretty,"Eugenia Price's imagination of this novel began with her discovery of St. Simons Island and specifically, Christ Church, once the parish home of Anson Dodge. When Price discovered the story behind Dodge's life - that he had been married twice and that his first wife had originally been buried under the pulpit in Christ Church - The Beloved Invader was born. The novel is Anson's story and has much to do with his stumbling upon this island in Georgia and dedicating himself to the post war reconstruction of its beautiful chapel. It is a very tender story of a man who's pretty flawed for a Price book (making him more real) and the two extremely different women who became his wives. This book is especially recommended for young people - little love story packed in with historical detail. Most fun to read the book and then go to St Simons and see all that was described."
5,Book about a relative of mine.,This was a well written book by the author. It was her first novel I believe. I so happens that Anson Dodge is a relative of our family so it made it more interesting to learn about what he had done in his short life.
4,Brilliant progressive compilation,"Regardless of whether this was pieced together or not, ""First Rays..."" is a masterwork. It marks (or rather, would have marked) Jimi Hendrix's progression as a rock artist. The songs that comprise this album are heavily influenced by the funk and soul of artists like Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. The evidence of this comes across crystal clear in songs like ""Drifting"" and the title track. Hendrix clearly doesn't abandon his roots, as evidenced by the raucous opener, ""Freedom"" and the heavy-hitting ""Dolly Dagger"" and ""Ezy Ryder."" As per usual, there is another classic blues interpretation, this one a jam with friends from Greenwich Village entitled ""My Friends."" This is a great album from a fantastic musician. I can't lament his death enough. This album needs to be in every true rock collection, along with ""Are You Experienced?"" and ""Blues."""
5,It's a good farewell,"Whether or not Hendrix' family got the song selection and order right, ie. in accordance with Jimi's wishes, is simply something we're never going to know, so take these ""this is how the album was meant to be"" claims with a grain of salt and just get into what he was doing here. Whatever else was going on, Hendrix was making a few moves towards a more funky, less psychedelic sound, as tracks like ""Freedom,"" ""Izabella"" ""EZ Rider"" and ""Earth Blues"" attest. He was also exploring his slower side just a bit more; I've always wondered ever since I heard ""Drifting"" almost 30 years ago (on the out-of-print CRY OF LOVE) whether Hendrix had intended to add more vocals to the track and, sadly, never got the chance. Not that he needed to; the small orchestra of guitars he layered on top of each other for the last 60% of the song is really lovely to listen to. FROTNRS may or may not be the ""definitive"" assembly of Hendrix' final works, but it contains some terrific, timeless music."
3,The Sun Also Rises part 2,"Both Stephen King and Peter Straub have ventured into the realm of ""literary horror;"" King in Bag of Bones, and now his fictional counterpart, Straub, with Mr. X.This book is reminiscent of Straub in many ways-- vague, shadowy plot, complex scenarios, too many characters. This yarn was working well for me up until about 200 pages. Thereafter, the book bogged itself down in Ernest Hemingway-esque absurdity.The antagonist of the tale, ie. Mr. X, Edward Rinehart, Mr. Sawyer, seemingly take a back seat to the preceedings in lieu of Straub's investigation into high class life and unsolved murders.This book is not his best by any means. Too many ancillery characters that function as weeds in Straub's horror garden--sucking the suspense of the story.Straub's best is Shadowland. Ghost Story had its moments, too."
2,Unimpressive,"One of Straub's major strengths as a writer is the quality of his characters and he continues to provide satisfaction in that regard with _Mr. X_. Unfortunately, this is where the satisfaction ends. The plot (as noted in the editorial reviews, based on an 'evil other' theme) is confused-- I don't need a no-brainer book, but in a horror book I shouldn't have to constantly jump back and forth to figure out what I just read either. The relationship between Ned and his (not) twin is unclear as is the nature of his powers. I agree with the reviewer who suggested Straub return to the basics."
5,The other customer reviews on this page astonish me,"I am a Straub fan. A big fan. But I don't give him props for everything he does. The work has to earn it. This book earns it. It features the hallmarks of other Straub works, particularly the theme of ""this is how the past shapes and haunts the present."" The writing itself, of course, is beyond reproach. The plotting is intricate, as it explicitly invokes Lovecraft and implicitly pays him homage. The denouement brings it all together in a way that is not only satisfying, but also in a way that simply makes sense. Does the final sentence leave you questioning all that has come before, as one of the jacket blurbs claims? Of course not. Does it leave you anxiously awaiting the release of Straub's next work of art? Absolutely."
2,I'm very disappointed,"Peter Straub is my favorite author I hate saying anything bad about him. I went to the bookstore like most other Straub fans every week to see if Mr. X arrived. Told everyone I came across about it. The first day it came out I called people to read to them a little of the first couple of Chapters. But that was the only thing I liked about this book was the first one third. After that it was to long, to many names to keep track of, and just boring. Peter is a great writer but sometimes I think he tries to impress us with it to much. It's like you have to be an English professor to understand his true meaning of what he is writing. Well I don't understand."
2,Not quite a return to form,"About 100 pages too long and with a ""Clive Barker ending"" (which is not a true ending at all but a cheat) Mr. X disappoints. The start is truly interesting but by the time we get involved with a combination of Lovecraft and unexplained special powers you no longer care. I made it to the end because I found the beginning so gripping but I did not feel it was worth the effort. Straub has written much better books and they are well worth reading, but this and The Hellfire Club are misses."
2,Thanks goodness it wasn't my lack of attention!,I just read through the reviews and am relieved to see that I am not the only one who was a little confused with all the different characters and plots. I actually listened to this as an audio book during my commute to work for a few days. As interesting as it seemed- I really had a hard time following - and I thought maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention listening. Thanks to the other reviews- I won't be buying the book to see what I missed out on.Don't get me wrong- all the characters are interesting and the small town very well depicted- it just got too convoluted in some parts for me and I love Peter Straub!
2,"Padded, ponderous, pretentious, preposterous pulp.","Straub seems to have reached the point where he or his publishers feel that every book MUST be big to be a bestseller. We are treated to lengthy descriptions of the frying of bacon and okra, serving no other point in the plot than to demonstrate that the protagonist's aunts are healthy eaters. You can almost sense him thinking, ""Well, at least I'm filling pages!"" The best scenes seem borrowed from MYSTERY, and nothing has the eerie resonance of his best work. A huge disappointment that never convinces for an instant. When I idly glanced at the next book in my stack (Graham Joyce's THE TOOTH FAIRY) and encountered economical, witty, sinewy prose, I knew I was never going to finish MR. X."
3,Texas Mom,"I ordered this for my daughter's bitty baby. The bitty baby fits perfect. You get what you pay for though, the seat is flimsy and it is pretty difficult to carry the seat/doll around without the seat falling back and dumping the doll. I was hoping the seat would be a little more realistic."
2,Very small,"Though my granddaughter loved it for her dolls, I thought it was too small and cheaply made for what I paid."
4,Daughter loves it,"My daughter wanted a baby carrier more than anything for her 4th birthday and she loves this one. It is really lightweight, which is perfect for her. The cloth covering is pretty too. But it does seem kind of pricey for what it is and I found something similar for half the price at the grocery the week after I bought this one. Fits my little mommy doll well."
3,"no page turner, but still entertaining","This was the first Updike book that I have read, and it was worth reading. Don't expect any drastic plot elements to emerge-they don't. Instead, it's just a nice small book with some very interesting and sometimes beautiful portraits of older persons. At points, Updike's style is grating (conversation becomes especially confusing at the end), but it's still a good read, especially if the reader is interested in older persons."
1,Absolutely aweful,"Yes, I am an 808 State fan. Yes, I am a fan of electronic music. No, I'm not being unfair. This album is absolutely poor in every way. While I was listening to it I actually thought it might be the result of 808 State getting stuck in a bad record contract (which is quite common) - that kind of thing results in a very good album (Exel), in which the songs were created in an atmosphere of creative freedom, being followed up by an incredibly bad album because of the bitterness of realizing you've gotten screwed.Surely you, like I, have noticed what I now call ""The Amazon Effect."" This is where things get overly high reviews because fans are the only ones who bother to rate it. This is particularly the case when it comes to ratings of movies & CDs. It's to the point that ratings for these kinds of things are almost completely unhelpful. There's no substitute for listening/viewing first."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Getting money for Graduate School is a lot like playing PowerBall, or the state Lotto. Your best bet is always institutional aid through the grad program where you applied.This book is at least a third chock full of fellowships. Many awards are for PhDs. I found two that I might qualify for as an MFA student.It's inexpensive enough, and is a quick ""read"" -- but don't get your hopes up.Best if you're a woman, minority (African-American, Asian, Native American, SOME latino) or looking for fellowships. No good for MFA's."
2,Not good for masters candidates,"I am a woman pursuing a masters in architecture degree. While the book was well-organized, about 85-90% of the scholarships and grants were for doctoral candidates. Out of over 1000 grants, I only found 6 that I MIGHT qualify for, and three of them I had already heard about through my internet searches. People pursuing a masters degree would not benefit from this book..."
2,backward field or a text that hasn't been updated,"The book came out in 2001, yet it has the feel of something that has not been updated recently, up to that year. Several of the diagrams depict a personal computer. Yet it is clearly one from the 80s. Why weren't more current diagrams used?One illustration shows punched cards used for I/O. With text describing it. How is this again?! In general computer usage, punched cards were virtually extinct by the mid 80s. Is CNC really this backward? That is, does the book accurately reflect the CNC field, as of 2001? If not, then the book is badly flawed."
4,Classic lost world adventure from the UK,"If you liked S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, you'll love this! In this classic UK adventure, the high-level heroes (17-19) must journey through time to a savage lost world that is being exploited by a nefarious alien race - masters of an eldritch magic known only as technology. Time itself has become corrupted, and the reality the PCs dwell in begins to unravel... interesting and very challenging!"
3,Former scoffer at amateur reviewers learns lesson.,"I'll give it a three, but most assuredly this can't be danced to. How such an engaging mis en scene became, instead, a fairly tedious exercise in displaying the author's overwhelming grasp of the subject's many causal factors and subsequent ramifications, is as mysterious to me as the irrationality of burning a woman because she was suspected of being possessed by a supernatural being itself. That somewhere along the way, Bourke DID cause this realization--and its resulting link-up of text and topic--is about as strong of a case as I can make for awarding a less than satisfying book three stars. Yes, a raison d'etre for any sort of published writing is a precariously subjective thing, but I wound up with the distinctly uneasy feeling that I'd much rather be reading a grossly sensationalistic treatment of this highly-engaging topic. Chalk it up as yet another case of the academy defeating itself."
3,"Not ""Black Pyramid""","You probably know this but just in case you're just getting into Black Pyramid, this isn't the band you're thinking of.Black Pyramid (the doom band) only have one actual CD release with a smattering of 7"" singles and a split 12"". Don't know much about the release in question here except that it's not the Black Pyramid you're probably looking for.Just a heads up."
2,Stories for adults,Wasn't to happy with this one.. couldn't even get into it so it's back in the book shelf.. will trade it in sometimes this month without finsihing it..
4,Very Compatable,"I was pleased to find this reader worked well with many brands of media. I can simultaneously read and copy between: A 3 year old Canon MMC card, 2 year old Olympus SmartMedia, and new Canon & Lexar(128MB) CF cards. It was plug-and-play with Mac OS 10.3.3, and iPhoto opens right up when you insert a card. The reader didn't like being plugged into the USB 1.0 port on the keyboard, but it works great when plugged into the USB 2.0 port on the G5."
4,Works Great,I needed a card reader for the proprietary XD memory used in my digital camera so I bought this reader. It is a great value for this price because it reads 8 different formats of memory cards. Great if you use several formats of memory cards or have friends with other cards.It hooks up via a USB docking station and is backward compatible with the older USB standard. It also comes with a short USB connector if you do not want to carry around the docking station. It just plugs and plays in Windows XP. It creates 4 removable disks in my computer for each memory format because there is 4 slots and each slot fits 2 different memory formats. This makes it possible to move data from one format to another very easily with some obvious limitations.Overall a Keeper
1,does not work with SDHC,"High capacity SD disks are very popular, I can not belive any multi-card reader does not have the ability to read these cards."
2,Not worth the $$,"I got this tool because I LOVE the laser level and it works so well - NOT so with the laser tape! I guess we need a little bit more technology before something like this can be very useful as a household tool. When its low on battery especially, it gives wacky numbers that are nothing close to the actual distance! It also doesn't work well if you have patterned wallpaper - it needs a solid surface! When it does work, it only measures to the closest inch - anyone who has done home repairs knows that isn't nearly close enough! An inch might as well be a mile! I don't recommend this product."
3,You get what you pay for,"I received this as a gift and for my line of work, it works OK.Don't expect exact accuracy, that's not what it is for. It is very good for me on estimates. Sure I get some obvious errors, but if you read the maunal, you will see that most are addressed there. Why would anyone use this to get measurements for cutting trim..??? That is what a tape is for."
3,"Average Performance, and some flaws...","This RC looks nice and does most of the job it's supposed to do. I have 3 concerns:1) The XPress function ALWAYS fails to control (on,off,input selection, etc) one or more of the multiple components I programmed it to control in the ""macro"" or sequence of actions you program using the software.2) I ALWAYS need to point the RC almost perfectly to the TV or Receiver InfraRed. It seems to be not so powerful when sending signals. And yes, I did use BRAND NEW alkaline batteries.3) The GUIDE and MENU buttons, which I use a lot when using my cable box, are relatively small and hard to press.Bottom line: I won't return it, but I wouldn't order another one."
5,Perfect watch,Love the watch. Rubber strap looks good and does not feel cheap. Perfect to wear to work if you wash your hands often and are worried about getting the straps wet. Nice hefty weight to the watch. Size of the watch is also perfect to me. I don't like those huge 45mm plus watches!
4,Sturdy and Large Capacity,"This is big enough to carry a loot of tools. The construction is sturdy, every pocket seems to be rip proof. There are also some pockets inside the bag. Has a shoulder strap, with a velcro closure to for the handles. Bottom has a rigid support to keep it from sagging while you are carrying it.My biggest gripe is that the zipper cannot be closed without using both of your hands. The outside pockets flaps does not close enough to secure what is inside."
3,OOPS,"I love the song, but didnt realize that this only had the one song on it. There are two different versions of the song but it gets pretty old."
4,Great stuff - Missing the Liner Notes/Booklet,Great stuff. Shows classic old-school Dizzy in a quintet setting (great Sonny Stitt work on alto and tenor sax as well).The package was MISSING the 16 page liner notes with (supposed special pictures and information). This was disappointing.
3,Mediocre at best......,"Well, I listened to this album twice, so I wouldnt feel biased while writing this review. Yes, Quentin Tarantino is a genius at movie soundtracks--but this aint one of them. Maybe because the movie isnt out yet and I have no idea how each track is woven into the scene or because Vol.1's track listing is much more likable. This album just doesnt excite me, like Vol. 1 does. If I never heard Vol. 1 and only Vol. 2, I probably still wouldnt have liked this. However, some great standout tracks here are ""Il Tramonto"", ""Can't Hardly Stand It"", ""The Chase"" and ""Urami Bushi""--this track is rolling during credits of Vol. 1 I believe, and it didnt make the cut for that. But overall this effort is not as fluid as Vol. 1's diversity and that's how the cookie crumbles."
4,pain free labor,"I bought this for my daughter. She found it interesting & was able to use one thing from it for sure. Finding her ""happy place"" when in labor helped her get through some of the pain.She ended up giving birth with not one single drug!"
1,ruined show,"The music is not the same. They ruined everything. The music was a critical part of this show, providing a sort of narrative that tied things together. It was the soundtrack for the short films that NE was, this was not a typical tv show. No music, no purchase. This is totally destroyed. Burn all copies. I hate this."
1,No Original Music -- No Buy,"I agree absolutely with the other ""one-star"" reviewers when they say the replacement music ruined the series.I haven't heard the ""new & improved"" versions, but I can imagine how different they must be. Since the music was so much a part of the series and so incredibly descriptive of the story line, to think it could be replaced is insane.Reviewers who give the new versions top marks either have not seen the original series with the original music, or they don't remember how much an integral part it played.Sorry, folks... until they have the original series with the original music, my money's staying in my wallet.I'm lucky to be able to record the series, or at least a good part of it, on my DVR in the original versions AND no commercials!! One of our local PBS TV stations is showing them intact. I'll stick with them."
1,awful product - why 4 1/2 stars?,"For all the reasons in the other reviews, this is an awful set. Universal ruined the value of one of tv's best series by chopping out the musical artwork. This was not a trivial decision. It was vandalism.Given the large number of single-star ratings, I cannot understand why Amazon lists it as 4 1/2 stars.Can someone explain?"
5,A gift for my daughter,I also loved this show but it kept me up too late for work the next morning. My daughter watched it in re-runs and didn't get to see them all. She asked me to get the series for her.
1,Glad I read the reviews!!!,"Wow. I can't believe anyone would alter this show. It was so great, but to butcher it and leave out the music...Universal, I would have gladly boughtthe set, was going to buy the set, until I realized you edited out the magic. Guess I will be shopping elsewhere. How disappointing but not surprisingafter how the actors were treated. What did the rest of us expect?"
1,Waiting for COMPLETE episodes,"""Northern Exposure"" and the British series ""As Time Goes By"" are my two very favorite TV series. I have the complete ""As Time Goes By"" and I can watch it regularly and enjoy that fine story. How I wish I had original versions of NX to watch. That was the show that always left me with a smile on my face, due in part to scene perfect music that was played. I'll continue to wait in hopes that the original episodes will be released. Like others, I'm willing to pay a premium to have them too. For now, there is no use in owning them. How unfortunate"
2,Carmen,"Although I love this opera, I was under the impression that this book would be in English, but it was in French. It did not specify that it was in the original language, and appeared to say that it would be in English so I was disappointed."
4,art later appreciated,this album is nice. when i bought it in 93 it was ok but i really got into this albulm about 6 years later. sometimes with de la it happens like that. you have to get it to sit back and digest it and then you will understand what i mean.
5,Dope De La Strikes again,"This album was highly slept on, most people thought de la fell a little short after their first two albums, but that is a dis. How can you overlook songs like ego trippin', breakadawn, eyepatch, en focus, etc.. Every track on this album is on point, and this is probably the most jazzy album they have had, so all you fans of jazz/rap this is the album for you. This album is the bomb and definately one of my fovorites, dont sleep on it!"
1,Bobbi Brown lipsticks & lip gloss,"Hi have been an avid Bobbi Brown makeup user for many years. Until this last year. I purchased 4 lipsticks in the last 7 months & they all broke in half immediately on the first use. I never had this problem in the past & can only assume Bobbi Brown is using a new manufacturer of her products, and, or someone is not paying attention to how they are making the lipstick. I was also very disappointed with the low quality brush which came with the tube of shimmering lip gloss, Both of these products were below the standards I was used to with Bobbi Brown products. I do however continue to use her face & eye cream."
5,Going Deeper,This is definitely one of the most amazing books I have ever read. My library is replete with hundreds of mystical wonders; Jean-Claude Koven has been given a most wondrous gift to share with the world. Reading this book is a life-changing experience!
4,Vintage Vandross comes alive with R&B,"It is assuring to see Vintage Vandross maintains his warmy silky cooing tone to belt out romantic ballads instead of going the Hip-hop/Rap stream where everybody is rushing towards. With this self-entitled album from Clive Davis's J records, he makes the style of traditional R&B; comes appealing - check out ""Take you out"" and infuses heart-rendering vocals in great ballads from Shep Crawford, ""I rather"", Diane Warren ""If I was the One"", ""Can Heaven Wait"" from Soulshock and Babyface -""Like I'm invisible"".Graceful with his own style, Luther Vandross makes R&B; prodigy Craig David take a backseat that age and appeal comes together. His voice with the right grooves and warmth - can actually enchant with his rich baritone. With a stellar cast of producers, this album entrenches Vandross's position as one of R&B; soulful maestro."
3,LUTHER ROCKS...,"ON BALLADS, LUTHER IS THE MASTER. ONLY HE CAN RE-DO DIONNE WARWICK OLDIES TO PERFECTION. GOOD TO SEE AN OLD SCHOOL MUSIC MAN WHO IS STILL ON POINT BEYOND THE KIDDIES ON THE CHARTS."
2,Luther Vandross new CD,"I've always liked Luther's songs. He sings them with emotion, softness, just great - you can get lost in them. But, this new CD of his, which I awaited anxiously for, did not have the same effect. It just wasn't what I was hoping it would be. Sorry, Luther, try again."
3,"""Sometimey"" CD","As a major Luther fan I bought this CD based on the ""Can I Take You Out"" song...which is fabulous...but it's downhill from there. Perhaps 4 killer songs here at best. You pick 'em. If this CD was as good as Luther looks now, it would be excellent. His getting in shape and healthy is an inspiration...he deserves bravos for that alone. This latest CD is bested by Jill Scott, Alicia Keys and others who were able to lay out one track after another of arresting music in their respective styles. Luther's incredible voice is certainly up to it."
2,"just FYI, not a review","Just thought I'd let everyone know that most of these are silent films from 1927-1928. That is not to say they are bad films, just maybe not what you were expecting. I have not bought or watched these films. Just belive this is something most buyers would want to know and I did not see any indication in the product description. Hichcock movies for about $2 each may still be a good buy."
4,Pretty Good Film,Recomend this Order the first film is better but both are pretty good ! Pretty girls having fun old fim but still worth having ! So yes get the Pack and have fun !
1,book,"not what i expected at all. i thought there would be more stories about surviving the holocaust, but the few stories i did read centered more on life afterward. the stories did not interest me at all."
5,Exemplary Survivors that Must Not Be Forgotten,"These are amazing stories. The authors not only tell about their own personal experiences as daughters of Holocaust survivors, but many essays also include accounts of the horrific experiences of the parents during the Holocaust. It's through books like this that we are reminded to ""never forget"" the horrors of the past, and at the same time, we are reminded about the strength and determination of the human spirit. The ""daughters"" have not only survived, they have also thrived. They can serve as role models and inspiration for all."
4,DC's rockinest second-wave cats--must have!,"This CD definitely had me tappin my hooves to the swingin beats. Good stuff, and they put on an awesome live show. Definitely the recent best of DC's second wave ska groups."
1,Disgraceful garbage,"Another bomb from Lonely Planet. Incoherent, often wrong and poorly written. It amazes me how this company's guide books have become the most popular amongst young travellers. This one covers the entire Scandinavian region - including the baltic republics and St. Petereburg. Like most of the regional LP books, this one doesn't follow a standardised format and provides the reader with reams of useless information. How anyone is supposed to plan a trip using this book is beyond me. Garbage."
3,RELATING,I ENJOYED THIS SHORT STORY. AS I WAS ABLE TO RELATE TO MY CHILDHOOD AS MY FATHER WAS A JEWISH CHARACTER SIMALAR IN A WAY TO THE CENTRAL CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK. WOULD LIKE TO DROP A NOTE TO THE AUTHO. HOW DO I DO THIS?
1,Shrek watch,"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box, the clasp broke and it's not repairable. Apparently it's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled, it's too fragile to just pull from the holder."
4,Old Fashioned Fun,"This book had the old fashioned feel of Little Women. The school is like a big family where there may be disagreements, but ultimately all of the members look out for each other. I think that the french and german words sprinkled throughout the book are a good way for today's kids to learn a few basic phrases in different languages."
3,drug-east bay-hate-punk,"i don't care for filth because they are terrible, silly bastards who play a sort of non-music. blatz is amazingly beautiful, spiteful, hateful, screaming punk. they hate everything. the outtakes on the blatz side are pretty clever, if you like show off punk rock non-posturing posturing. both bands did more drugs than oasis. the shows were dangerous. this is the same scene green day came from, though they sound nothing alike."
2,Comes with dead battery,"When the first one came, I could not get the watch to work either. I exchanged it with Amazon, and the replacement had the same problem. I took it apart and found that the battery was dead. The paperwork is also wrong - the correct battery is #364 (SR621)."
1,HORRIBLE PACKAGING!!!,"This was a beautiful item but when it arrived, it was a bazillion pieces!!!! What a shame! The packaging was the worst of the worst! I would love to order it again but afraid it would arrive in the same condition1"
3,Chinese Tales kinda boring,"This book was a collection of Chinese folk tales for children.A few were cool,but some were boring.If you love newberrys or folk tales,you'll like the book.I only read it cause I like newberrys and hope to read them all.Also they sometimes use Chinese words and tell you what they mean,but the sentence won't make sense."
2,BLF Review,Although I really enjoyed seeing the old video of Akamine Sensei performing kata and truly documents the history of his organization I thought the production in particular the interview was not that great. Mr. Lee truly had a vision when he filmed this in the 60's but I wish he had of said which kobudo kata Akamine taught him instead of which weapons he was taught.
1,Do I really have to say this...?,"Hmm, lessee... 21 tracks on ""Further Along"", 12 tracks here, both the same price... the choice is yours!!"
4,"Great program, dated discussion","I enjoyed this book. The material on how to handle your CASH reserves is out-of-date, though. You'll have to think about today's financial atmosphere and substitute alternative vehicles. However, the method of investing is still rock-solid. Buy low, sell high...automatically! Besides the dated material, the only other negative comment I'll offer is that the author does not go into details on how to handle purchases in your portofolio if your vehicles do not handle fractional shares. Even more, I missed how one handles purchases or sales that aren't exactly what A.I.M. recommends.I do give this book high marks because it is very readable and in today's world of computers, spreadsheets, and Internet access, A.I.M. can be handled very easily, more so than suggested in the book."
1,This won't work and I'll tell you why,"I quickly glanced at this in the bookstore, and here's what I noticed. All examples which back up the author's claim are for stocks that fluctuate perfectly between two fixed prices (10 down to 4, up to 10, down to 4, etc.) The problem is that if a stock were to actually go up over time (which historically is much more common), you'll get better better returns using a simple dollar cost averaging technique and never selling what you've previously bought. There's no way to know in advance which stocks will exhibit this perfectly cyclical nature over the long term, and the fact that all examples depend on this pattern should be pretty revealing!"
4,He Saw Me,"This particular song is so powerful. I have tried to find the music and lyrics without success. If this is available, I hope you can help me."
4,Ltterhead and Logo Design 9 (Letterhead & LOGO Design (Quality)) (v.9),The latest collection of diverse and inspirational logos and letterheads from around the globe. A great sample of the ever changing trends in design expectations and innovation.
5,Great,Great inspirational book. So many wonderful design that got me dizzy with a bit of envy. Highly recommended.
5,Valuable Resource,"This is a great resource that I found very valuable. I also appreciate the fact that it's very practical and user-friendly, with a touch of humor that makes it fun to read. I highly recommend it!"
3,Savvy Stuff - Helpful Information,This book has some very helpful notes and a good collection of addresses and telephone numbers for organizations and associations. I will be recommending it on my website on eldercaregiver info.
4,A good look at Thelonious and crew,"This is good crisp visual with good audio of a groupthat merits a glimpse of their contribution to music.This scratched my itch for a view of the great CharlieRouse, who has been underated, as one cd is titled,""The Unsung Hero"". You will see Thelonious give way toCharlie's superb playing. I thank Europe for filminggreat American musicians for us."
3,"Nice thickening effect, not good scent.",The effect of the thickening is pretty obvious and I like it but the smell of old shaving cream I can do without. That almost kills the product and it wont go away easily.
2,"A good idea, but poorly executed","I'm a fan of James Bond and electronic music, so I thought I'd really enjoy this CD. I was sorely mistaken. ""Bond Beat & Bass"" is a compilation of very poor remixes of music from the earlier Bond movies (taken mostly from the Connery and Moore films). A couple of the tracks on this CD are okay (I liked ""Goldfinger Part 2""), but that's about it. I was extremely disappointed. The James Bond films boast such incredible music and all of the original songs could lend themselves very well to new electronic mixes, but none of the artists on this album managed to get it right. What a shame."
5,Unparalled,"This is BY FAR one of the BEST albums by the most under appreciated band of ALL TIME. Period. IF You claim to like rock music, add this to your collection. Strong from beginning to end. Not one iffy tune. Not even close.You will NOT be disappointed!!! And for the one reviewer who questioned Rick's songwriting, check out Diary of a Working Man from Marauder.James"
4,"Great, but could have been greater","I bought this CD used from here on Amazon and I am quite impressed with it. These guys are very origional, play extremely fast and are very musicaly talented. The only draw back is that sometimes they play a little too fast, and it ends up sounding like fuzz from a broken tv. My favorite tracks are Sarcophagus, Unas Slayer Of The Gods, Wind Of Horus,Invocation To Seditious Heresy, and Ruins. In Their Darkened Shrines is an almost perfect mix of brutality, melody, and origionality (the egyptian themes and what not). I recomend this CD to any death/black metal lover."
2,I don't get it.,"I always see people write bad reviews for ""nu-metal"" bands, saying their lyrics are crap, they have bad guitars, etc. Then I always see these same people praise death metal bands like Nile. So, being the fair person I am, I got some of Nile's music, and wasn't impressed.Reason One: The Lyrics.Al I heard was grunts and growls. Most bands that yell (like Slipknot and Mudvayne) usually do it so you can at least make out what they are saying. They also have melodic parts to. All this had was AHHHHHH!!!!!! UH!!!!!!!!!!!! UAHHH!!! which brings me to,Reason 2: The Music:After the grunts was a guitar part that sounded like the other 1000 identical guitar parts in each of their songs. I have to admit, they have good guitar and drum players, but they never do anything but make loud, un-melodic racket.Bands like Dimmu Borgir are different though, as they have good guitar and drum parts with good lyrics."
5,"Perfect shade, highly durable!","This is the perfect shade of light pink if you like just a hint of color on your nails. This would work well as the topcoat for a french manicure, and it is gorgeous by itself. 2 coats work out great, but I think you could get away with one coat with no problems.I have a few bottles of Zoya polish and they are the most durable I've ever used. Doesn't show ANY chipping or dulling of color, and the color comes off very cleanly when you do want to remove it. It is far worth it to pay a couple bucks more than you'd pay for a drugstore brand and have a product that is far superior."
1,Experienced Knitters Only,"I've had this book for months and while I do flip through it occassionally I've yet to cast-on one project.I wish some indication of the level of difficulty for each pattern was included because this is NOT a book to learn new techniques. In my opinion it's for a very experienced knitter who is at ease using charts (up to 15 various symbols), doesn't need schematics, or even clear pics of the finished product. If you're at this level there are some lovely designs. But if you're not you'll need quite a large block of time without distractions or interruptions, excellent concentration, and some really good reference resources on hand. Most of the patterns assume you have prior experience in the more intricate techniques like colorwork, entralac, cables, etc...Yes, there are ""easier"" patterns but none so terrific that you couldn't find something similar on the net for free or just a few $.BTW, there are only a very few crochet patterns and they're nothing special."
4,Good book for Intermediate knitters,"I like the styles in this book. I'm not a big scarf person, but I bought a bunch of accessory books this past winter and this is definitely one of the better, more sophisticated ones. It has a lot of versatile & interesting projects by recognizable knitwear designers like Debbie Bliss, Lily Chin & Nicky Epstein. I especially like the Blizzard crochet shawl and capelet with sleeves. Beautiful photography and colorwork."
4,Purchased for one pattern,Although this is a well written book it could do with an update. Some of the designs seem a bit dated to me. I purchased the book specifically for the Lady Eleanor pattern. I do wish patterns were available for single use purchase through Ravelry as there was only one pattern in this book I wanted. Otherwise the book is very edited and the content is as most Interweave products well photographed.
3,"Great Patterns, But...","The layout of the book is funky. I love the patterns and the directions are clear, as well as the charts. The problem is the photography, I believe the publisher was trying to be a bit ""artsy"" with the layout and it just doesn't work. If you can hang with that then I would get the book."
1,Misleading Title,"The title of this book is very misleading. Of the 31 patterns, there is only ONE for crochet. The editor does not even bother to include instructions on how to convert knit patterns to crochet. Also, although the photographs are beautiful, they are very fuzzy - the details are difficult to see. This book was very disappointing."
4,Wonderful Scarves,"The author has come up with some innovative scarves, some of which are ""over the top"". Tilted blocks from Barbara Walker is well used in Midwestern Moonlight.I am a great believer that scarves should have two ""good"" sides. Some of these do and some don't."
2,only 2 crochet patterns!,"When I picked up this book at a local bookstore, I thumbed through it. I don't knit, I only crochet, and was severely disappointed that of the 31 patterns, only two of them were crochet - the other 29 were *all* knit. Perhaps if you knit, this book would be useful to you, the scarves were actually pretty nifty and the patterns seemed (from what I could tell) well written. I decided not to buy this book, especially as one of the crochet patterns was a very simplistic granny-square scarf."
1,Fear not -- we have a new three tenors.,"The three tenors I mean? Bocelli, Bolton, Amante. Actually, this guy makes Bocelli sound like the next Pav. NOT good."
1,The End of Opera,"Aren't there enough of these faux opera singers around? Do we really need another one with a microphone down his throat? And amazon.com, your software really compiled a ""GIGO"" list this time. Sarah Brightman, Michael Amante, and Karita Mattila (who is a legit opera singer --- actually doesn't use a microphone on stage!)as recommended selections?For those of you who want to hear real voices, don't fall for this pop garbage. The numbing and dumming continues and all I can say is .... the end of opera is closer than I thought."
5,Bravo !!!!,"My husband happened to see Michaels' PBS debut and taped it for me to watch. What a treat. We do enjoy some other Italian opera singers, but Michael is right up there at the top! My son purchased the CD for his dad for Father's Day and haved loved listening to it. The #13 sound track is absolutely amazing. Keep up the good work Michael...we are waiting for your next release!!!"
1,My god! Who let this dog sing?,"It really hurts your ears. If you want something like this, at least get it from Russell Watson. There are great singers from Brooklyn, Michael Amante is certainly not one of them. Please Mr. Amante don't sing. I wish Amazon had 0 star system."
5,"Watch Out Bocelli, Here Comes Amante!","Oh my goodness! Listen to track 13 titled ""Ho Bisogno d'Amore."" You will share my fondness--Italian and English fused love song. Beautiful, astoundingly beautiful. My repertoire purely consist of German and Italian operas and lieds for the majestry of the soprano; however, listening to Amante's debut recital reafirms my passion for what our male tenor voice can achieve! Tracks includes Maestro Pavarotti's signature aria, ""Nessun Dorma"" as well as my favorite aria from Rigoletto, ""La Donna e Mobile."" ""O Sole Mio"" is also included as well as ""Celeste Aida."" Superb recording! Go to (website) for more infomation, i.e. biography and a video interview!"

3,"it aint tyte, but its aight","most of the song son this cd are bumpin! especially anniversary, knockin' da boots and slam. but i have heard from most people that they didnt like the remix of weak. i really didnt like it either, becuase it messed up the chorus part. but this cd is good for a little get together, maybe a small party."
4,Springwater seasons,Springwater seasons is a relaxing light read to take you back to earlier times and restore your faith in friends family and life.
5,Not Ratt but Just as good!,"I wanted to take some time and listen to it a few times before writing a review. I wanted to be sure to get it right. I purchased this cd expecting to be mildly diappointed by it. I was very wrong. Although I found myself comparing it to Ratt because of the voice of Stephen Pearcy, I had to point out some differences. Any Ratt fan would love to have this one. ""Nothin' to Lose"" sounds like a typical Ratt song to me and I love it! However another favorite of mine is ""Cry no more"", a ballad!! ""Mother Blues"" is a acoustic and a little bluesy which is obvious from the title. In my opinion every song on this cd is well worth the listening. Hats off to a group who can make entertaining music without the use of four letter words. It's called talent. I can't stop listening to it. I'd highly reccomend this for any collection, especially for Ratt fans!!"
4,Great Scrap Yarn Vest,"Have small amounts of leftover yarn in various colors? I made the scrap yarn vest in this book and I love it! I am planning to make another one with more scrap yarn to give as a gift. It uses basic stitches in an interesting way to create nice color contrasts. Beginners can do this project, and advanced crocheters will also enjoy it.The other patterns in this book are okay - nothing really strikes my fancy, but they don't look difficult to make."
1,UNORIGINAL AND CHEAP!,"This song comes nowhere near Tarkan's Simarik. She just cant sing - its all computerized! Tarkan's song has a much better beat and rhythm. Nowadays, we have much more talented female singers, like Britney, Christina etc. Holly Valance is a model! Why doesnt she stick to what she does best?? The video is soooo cheap to start off with! I mean she is basically dancing naked, only there is light shining on her private parts and reflected back, so no one can see anything.... but then all those guys are touching her and etc. I could go on! Plus, it's just incredibly blondie and dumb - especially the ""mwaah"" kissing sound. Sorry, it gets one star!"
2,Contrived,"Well acted, but very situation contrived. That took away from the whole concept for me. The plot involves the grand concept of that when people are to die, they should die when they are supposed to. And if you try to change the course of things, there will be a price. So being that said, you know everyone is going to die. Every scene is predictably manipulated for the obvious out come. No surprises.It does have some well crafted scenes. The balcony piano scene is VERY well done.....reminds me ofIn Dreamswhen Annette Benning falls from the bridge.For a rental, it's cool. Actors are wonderful...but a weak, contived plot ruins it."
2,Overdubs ruin good music...,"The songs selected for this collection are great, rousing classics, but the producers of the CD series decided to overdub stadium crowd noise over most of the songs, completely ruining the original songs!!! Don't buy this if you want the pure songs in their original state..."
1,Worst service and ask for renewel,I paid for 1 year subscription for 6 persons and they never ever sent an issue to me. I claimed so many times and sent so many emails and never ever reply. I wish Amazon should handle this kind of unlawful matter and should consider for the customers who lost their money and most importantly being insulted.Southwest Art (1-year)
1,Fish with a Pucker - Purchased via Omaha Steaks Sales Rep,"Purchased Lemon Peppered Catfish as part of a Lenten Package offered via Omaha Steak's sales rep.First clue, the lemony smell emanating from my oven. We eat various fresh caught and frozen fish regularly at home and out and have purchased fish from Omaha Steaks in the past. Point being, lemon and fish is not a foreign concept nor are Omaha Steak's tasty, quality items.Second clue, the communal pucker, blinking eyes and eventual unison ""that's interesting"" (code for WTF). The lemon even over powered the pepper. It's a rarity to purchase ""a miss"" from Omaha Steaks...this was. Luckily their Customer Service is very responsive and credited my account.Lessons learned: 1. SAMPLE/TRY the item BEFORE making it the entree centerpiece of a meal I'm hosting. 2. Even ""misses"" aren't sold at a discount. 3. Teenager said ""something's inherently wrong Mom when you buy FISH from Omaha Steaks"" = have you lost your mind?"
4,Surprising,"The packaging is anomalous and the price is high, but no less unusual is the music, which is also of a surprisingly high quality. Brookmeyer is a good enough pianist to make the comparison with Bill rewarding and instructive. They take turns playing melodies and bridges, then trade whole choruses as well as phrases. In each case, Bill admittedly plays with greater precision, more focused tone, and hipper left-hand voicings, but Brookmeyer holds up his end thanks to his harmonic savvy and finger technique (most arrangers who play piano fail when it comes to digital dexterity). The rhythm section is the MJQ minus Bags.It's a pity to feel exploited by Japanese record producers charging triple for American music. On the other hand, maybe they understand the worth of some things better than we."

5,Coolio knows,"the song GANGSTA'S PARADICE is one of the tigth's songz dun by Coolio,and for all the homies out there this song is for those who have gone before us. SO PLEASE BUY COOLIO CD!!!!"
2,I liked coolio's gangsta's paradise and c u when u get there,"but this cd can't hang with those songs, it's too old school and corny sounding. Not worth buying, if your looking for a real talented rapper than look away from coolio, it will just make ya feel sorry for him and make ya buy his cd. so forget about coolio and go buy a real cd."
2,"""Gangsta's Paradise"" Is A Rap Classic!","But sadly it's not enough to save the album. Except for that one song the album fails on many levels (Even for rap music) with it's anoying lyrics, bad beats, and even bad rapping! Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it. He proved he's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with ""Gangsta's Paradise,"" and in the ""Space Jam"" soundtrack he (With the help of other rappers) helped make the best rap song I've herd! He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way!"
3,Coursey Island,A typical P. D. James mystery with all its twists and turns. One of my favorite mystery writers and a delightful read.
1,Don't waste your time,"Do not buy this book. It is unclear, confusing, and appears to have been published entirely without involvement from a proof-reader."
3,copy protection,I had trouble exporting this into iTunes but was able to do it eventually using external USB DVD burner/reader by Sony and not the internal mac superdrive.
5,Straight Outta Lynwood,"Al's mission to amuse and entertain continues. Parodys are sharp, original work makes you think and laugh out loud. Al is a GENIUS!"
3,DualDisc Can Eat It,"Good job Al. You thought you were being so anti-""the Man"" with your song ""Don't Download This Song"" and then you went and made your CD a DualDisc. DualDiscs can't play on any CD players. They suck. Nobody listens to CDs anyway. Everyone has some sort of MP3 player. That is why it is extremely ironic that you made ""Don't Download This Song"". I guess you wanted to get double the money when people bought your CD and then paid to download all the songs again. This CD isn't even that good. A few of the parodies are alright and ""Weasel Stomping Day"" is pretty funny, but if I would have known that I couldn't rip this POS to my computer I would have gotten my money back. So thanks Al. You used to be cool."
5,For any Al lovers.,This CD was just as awesome as any of his others. A must have for your collection.
4,"Great CD, but not excellent.","I bought this CD because we've totally loved the White and Nerdy song and video. I thought the video would be on it, but it isn't. There are like 6 videos on it, but not that one. I feel a little gypped, but it is still a very funny CD and it does have subtitles to all the songs when you play them on a DVD player, as well as pictures from Weird Al's childhood (very funny), so our loss isn't total, but it would have been nice to have that one video on it."
5,Funniest Guy i've seen in a long while.,"I first saw Jeff Dunham on YouTube and as soon as i saw that he had 2 DVD's then i just jumped at the chance of getting them. I have also Pre ordered the Christmas Show too and can't wait to recieve it.Jeff Dunham is a Fabulous entertainer and comedian and his puppet charictures are just out of this world. Peanut & Walter are my Favs.!! Funny.?? I watch these DVD's over and over again and i NEVER fail to laugh my bits off.!!! These are GREAT DVD's and I would HIGHLY recomend Buying them especially if you like Jeff Dunham, or even if you've never heard of him, you will LOVE HIM.!! I am HOOKED on Jeff Dunham and will be Buying EVERYTHING i can of his.!! If there was a TEN STAR rating on here then I would give him 11.!!! Well Done Jeff.!! Buy THESE DVD's you won't regret it.!!"
4,"Great, but not excellent.","The dvd was wonderful, full of the comedy I've come to expect from Jeff.The only place I found fault was in a couple of the special features, they just were not my taste in comedy. So to anyone thinking of getting this dvd, please do so, its wonderful."
4,LOL funny!,Amazon delivered right on time as usual. Jeff Dunham as popularized on You Tube is ROTF funny. Already watched several times with friends since purchase.
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","I don't know why so many people rate this OTT. It's all right, but I have seen funnier comedians. It's not bad, but not great. Peanut might be the funniest of his puppets."
3,Arguing with Myself,"Although funny, this routine isn't as hilarious as Spark of Insanity. We probably won't re-watch it as often as we do Spark."
5,Funny Funny,"Jeff Dunham is so funny with his buddies I just live Peanut, Jeff make him look like he is real and not a puppet."
5,Jeff Dunham,I've seen the live show as well as what the comedy channel presents and the CD's are the funniest ventriliquism act I've seen in a long time. Best bet is if you can get both of his cd as a set. I know he's working on a Christmas show CD to be released in the near future and I can't wait to view that show as well.
5,absolutely the best!,"i know ventriloquism is probably a dying art, and i must say that mr. dunham could singlehandedly revive it. he's not only good technically, he's a riot! i have shared this dvd with all my friends, and every one of them found something in his repertoire that they could connect with. i laugh until i hurt every time i watch it. thank you mr. dunham for bringing a little sunshine into my life! tell peanut we love him!"
2,Jeff DunhaArguing with myself,I have seem ihim before on a show and thought it would be funny for my granddaughter to watch with me but was I wrong about after the first few minutes he started using language not suitable for 8yr olds and I found it would have been just as funny without all of the bad language. Disappointed greatly.
4,Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself,"Great program only down side..it is too short, I want more humor, but don't get me wrong it is a good price!"
1,"Racism remains unfunny, even when coming from puppets.","Jeff Dunham is a racist. His ""characters"" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others. These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures. These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed ""ching chong ding dong"" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless ""comic"" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display. Now excuse me while I go try desperately to forget that I saw this."
5,Pee your pants funny,"Love Jeff, my favorite is walter and peanut. Just had to have them for my collection to watch whenever i need a good laugh."
5,This is my families absolute favorite video!,"I can't say enough how much my family, friends and myself have enjoyed this video! Jeff Dunham does a tremendous job and has us laughing the whole way through! This video is by far our favorite video on our shelf! We have watched it numerous times and still look forward to it each and every time! This is a video sure to entertain!"
5,Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself,This is an excellent show. Extremely hilarios. Highly recommend it to everyone I talk to. I have also purchased his Spark of Insanity video and it too is outstanding.Watch it! It is worth it.
5,ventriloquist/comedian,This is such a funny video...my husband and I both laughed sooo hard we cried! I would say anyone over the age of 18 will enjoy it. It's too graffic for anyone younger than 18.
5,Laughing out Loud!!,"I wanted a DVD that I could send in a care package to a U. S. soldier who is deployed, and this really filled the bill. My very first impression was that it was beginning slowly, but a minute or two after that, there was actual laughing out loud.If you would like a great comedy ""getaway from life,"" this is definitely one to try. This young man is really talented, and I would highly recommend this DVD."
5,Very Funny!!!,If you're looking for a great stand up comedy on dvd than look no further. Buy this dvd and you'll be glad you did. This dvd is extremely witty and funny. Jeff Dunham is a very talented comedian who deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his brilliance on this dvd.
5,writer,Beautiful music. The cello really comes through. Relaxing. Also exciting for me because I like it so much.
5,"Dramatic, yet soothing CD for Relaxation","Highly recommend this relaxation CD. It is different from YoYo Ma, but still needed it in my collection. Excellent for a morning time out."
1,Frustrating,I'm trying to teach myself Java and was recommended that I try using this book. With no solutions and no way to get them I find it frustrating. Some people may argue that students will cheat but students will find a way to do that no matter what. What are the people who arent in school but want to see the programs in the correct format supposed to do? If anyone has suggestions please let me know.
1,One of the Worst I Have Ever Seen,"This book is huge, has small fonts, is difficult to read, almost impossible to find what you are looking for, cumbersome, etc. This has to rank up there with the worst text books I have ever read. Unfortunately the University where I am taking Java courses is using it for 2 classes. I use other texts and the Internet and leave this one in the bookcase."
2,P Diddy ...,"This album is bad. The only good song was bad boy for life, and it was still kinda stupid. You get a lot of tracks for u buck but they're all useless, especialy if u have the clean version. Skip this [guy] altogether and get some real rap."
5,"SHAKE, BABY, SHAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I LOVE THIS CD. SOULFUL HOUSE IS WERE IT'S AT FOR DANCE MUSIC. I AM A HED KANDI FAN. HOWEVER AFTER I PURCHASE THE CD, HED KANDI SOUNDS LIKE POP HOUSE MUSIC COMPARED TO THIS CD. LOVE IT!"
3,C+,"They didn't ship the Item when they said they did EVEN though I selected Exp. Shipping. It was nearly 2 weeks before I got it and it was being shipped from New York to IA. I have ordered things from complete other countries such as Japan, England, and Argentina with Standard Shipping. I got those items within a period of FIVE days. (Trust me I keep track)Not exactly an enjoyable experience."
2,Collectors Item Only,"I bought this album because I love Jackass, CKY and Bam. I had a feeling the content on the cd was not going to be good but I did not really buy it for the songs. It is a rare album and I bought it because its a collectible. The songs are horrible, a few are cool because they are in the cky videos but the recording quality is laughable bad and the songs are just lame."
1,Nice doorstop...,"I bought this book about a year ago after reading the reviews on here. It's a big book, people sing praises of it, as you flip through the pages it definitely has some good stuff. I'm trying to use it as a reference I refer to every month or two when I'm working on relatively basic stuff...verifying a NAT setup on a router, maybe looking on how to setup rate limiting. I pick up this book, flip to the anemic index to find next to nothing on whatever topic I'm looking for. Maybe if I had time to sit down and become more familiar with this book it might be useful, but personally I find O'Reillys Cisco IOS in a Nutshell waaaay more useful."
3,Bought this for one song,"There is only one song on this cd that I bought it for, and not much impressed with the others, but their version of Laura (What's He Got..) - well I had that 45 in high school, and wore it out, bought another 45 at a local oldies record store, and it got played up until I made the switch to cd's, getting rid of all my old 45's and albums. It's a unique version of the song, a real toe-tapper of a normally down-tempo song."
1,"HORRIBLE Bottle Warmer, you get what you pay for...","Just like the other review says: ""You have to make sure the button that the bottle sits on is completely pressed down. I had to hold the button down myself or press the bottle down against it because the bottle wasn't heavy enough. Otherwise the device doesn't turn on or shuts off the second the button is not fully depressed."" HUGE problem and makes it totally worthless IMO. I say sport the few extra bucks and get one that works."
2,WAY too long to heat!,This warmer takes an obscene amount of time to heat a bottle. We had a 3 month old on a car trip and it wasn't even worth it. I suppose eventually it would heat a full bottle but it barely heated 4oz in 20 minutes. :(
3,Takes a long time,"It's good to have but takes too long to heat bottles, also if the bottle is less than half full, you cant turn it on..the power button is switched on by the weight of the bottle, so if the bottle is not atleast half full, you have to hold the power button down with ur finger. It takes a good 15 mintues to heat bottles, longer if the bottle is taken our of a freezer pack. The element provides good even heat."
2,"Great idea, good price, poor execution","I attempted to heat a bottle with this on our last trip, and it stayed on for about10 minutes (not long enough to heat a 2.5 oz bottle!?!) then every time I tried to turn it back on/fiddle with it to get it to continue, it kept turning off...so I never got the milk heated...how frustrating. I will be returning this item."
5,very good,The product is very good. Easy to operate. Gets warm up very fast. & so I don't have any problems while driving. Love this product. I recommend this product.
4,good buy .........,"I purchased 2 of these for my Motorola Q. Good price and plenty of storage for music. Much more ""bang for buck"" than the 4 gig that just came out."
4,its great to compliment the first one on my shelf,"psygone and the ozone songs just absolutely kick ass, and i guess there are others out there, now its hard for me to respect this cd cuz my tastes have been changed quite a bit, and funny its because of the songs by those two artists, they are great trance house tunes and i will always love em, its hard now for me to like comps, cuz i hate trippy techno or commercialized crap like the gravy train song or whatever it is, and the cars song was boring redundant and a horrible addition to the wonderful world of techno, i dont understand some peoples taste when it comes to preferences, when they claim that something is complex and stunning i think its boring and obnoxious, sorry people but im an oakenfold fan or van dyke or bt or christopher lawrence"
1,Wasted time,"My son wrote better fiction inFifth grade.I can not believe that I actually read this entire book.thankfully, it was free."
2,Falls apart at the end,"While this book started off on a relatively strong note, when I was about two thirds through the book it became so boring I really didn't care who the villain was. However, I thought I might as well finish it and that was 40 minutes of my life I will never get back. The ending was so ridiculous and absurd that I thought I had missed an entire chunk of the book. Sadly, that was not the case. It was almost as if two different people had written the book as there was no connection between the beginning and the end. I am not sure what happened with this book but perhaps his next one gets better? It was free for me and I believe it was worth the price."
4,Ted's review,This book was a good read. It was slow getting started. In the end it had a good twist to it. I would recommend this book to any mystery suspense reader.
3,"Not really ""The Series""","For eighteen dollars, this box set is actually a very good price. For your money you get the three Once a Thief movies: the pilot episode, plus Family Business and Brother against Brother, the two movies made by combining episodes from the television series. I did enjoy the three movies, in and of themselves. The episodes blended quite well into movies. However, it was rather disappointing that the box set was the movies, when it is called ""The Series!"" I'm still waiting, as patiently as possible, for them to truly release the entire series!"
4,Not a True Equivalent to NP-40,"The battery charges well with my Casio charger, and works fine in my EXILIM - z1080, but isn't actually equivalent. The NP-40 that comes standard with new Casio digital cameras is a 3.7v with 1300 mAh, this battery is only 1230 mAh.The difference is probably not noticeable during casual use though, as it only reduces the number of flash photo exposures by less than 10%. Overall, I am very happy. The price is very good on this product and it performs well."
4,dont overlook,"This album may have been the death knell for great band,but none the less there are some great songs to be had here.Obviously they were under pressure to sound like M-TV but if you look past that you still have a band that made a living opening up for AC-DC,SCORPIONS and IRON MAIDEN and giving those boys all they could handle. Just listen to the last three songs on here and I think youll agree these boys had the chops to go toe to toe with anyone."
2,"Nice Book, but beyond level 1","While the book is nice enough, if you're looking for a beginer's book that your preschooler can read on their own with your help this isn't for you. Is ""stickleback"" a word the editors expect preschoolers to read at a ""beginning to read"" level? Really? I'm expecting more of a ""See Spot run."" level. I would recommend DK reader's Fishy Tales instead as the vocabulary is simpler."
5,Excellent story!,An excellent continuation of Corran Horn's story. Expands on being a Jedi along with great action sequences. The change to a first person point of view form third person was a little confusing at first but soon forgotten. Geat book! Five Stars
2,Confusing and un-nesasary,"I, Jedi is confusing and VERY un-nesasary in the series. The first person concept Stackpole uses causes a CONSTANT re-reading of pages. E.g. ""I'm coming to the acadamy."" ""Great."" He replied. Due to the normal 3rd person sceneario we really don't know who is saying what! This book is un-nesasary in the series because it dosen't fall into place. This book takes place during the Jedi Acadamy Trilogy. If you read this before reading JAT, JAT will be very boring because you know what happens. Also the JAT books are just better in general so you wouldn't get all the quality out of them. If you read JAT then read I, Jedi the book is even worse. You know what's going to happen next and this book is just bad in general. So I recommend skipping this one, in fact try to petition this book out of the series. (IF YOU MUST READ ALL THE BOOKS READ THIS ONE AFTER jat.)"
2,recycled plot,"I found this book and many recently published Star Wars Titles extremely predicatable and at times boring. The Star Wars univese needs to start coming up with new plots because every book seems to put the characters in similar, recycled positions...I feel that the Star Wars Universe is being polluted and exploited with too many excess novels and Bantam should stop putting out so many new stories. When Heir to the Empire came out in 91 I read it at least 3 times... now, with novels like I Jedi, I find it had to finish one... I think the publishing company should take it easy for a while for the sake of the readers and star wars itself..."
2,AGGGHHH!,"As I read through the Star Wars Saga in continuity beginning after ROTJ I have to admit that this was my least favorite story so far. While Stackpole built up the Corran Horn character towards greatness in the Rogue Squadron books, this long, drawn out, often silly always egotistical novel, bored me to the point where the final 40 pages blurred as I wanted so bad to just finish the book and forget about it. While writing in the first person was inventive, Stackpole as Corran comes across as fan-boyish, as does the constant fact that Corran comes out as the true hero in situations already handled by others in the Jedi Academy Trilogy. I just hope that the newer books stick closer to his Rogue Squadron roots than this."
1,I hate this book so much I'm posting a second review.,"This book is tripe, and I'm in disbelief at the constant praises it's been receiving. Badly written, with boring villains, weak ending, weak characters, weak Luke, absence of Han and Leia, and a Super-Corran (funny, he isn't even mentioned at all in the Jedi Academy Trilogy) all combine to make this one of the lousiest books I've ever read. And to the viewer who criticized my earlier review, TESB had FAR more action than this trash, and the focus of TPM wasn't on Anakin; it was on Qui-Gon. DUH! Even The Crystal Star is better (MUCH) than this."
5,"Exciting, with a whole lot of suspense","I, Jedi was a great book it has Corran always going for the hard and dangerous challenges. He defys the laws of the pirates that he is with in an undercover mission to destroy. He proves that he is a jedi and has the force and Luke Skywalker on his side."
2,Poorly written and redundant Jedi Academy material,In the end I liked it but it was tough going at the beginning to get into. Stackpole's attempt at a first person account is quite stilted at first but seems to flow better once the story gets going. I thought it would have been much better if less time was spent on the Yavin Jedi academy story which we have already read about before and more time was spent on the new Jedi sammari and the twisted babe admiral. I liked somebody standing up to the two dimensional nature of Luke Skywalker and the great Lucas Good vs Evil dichotomy of the universe but it could have been so much more...I like the other Rogue Squadron novels better.
5,Awesome book for boys and girls!,"This is such a cute book! It's about a little girl and her nighttime play with her dinosaur. We picked this book up at the local library for my 5 year old. The first time I read it, her eyes lit up and I could tell that she was imagining she was the little girl in the book with her dinosaur. I came to Amazon to find this book so I can get a copy for her to keep. She loves this book and is slowly working her way to reading this book for herself."
4,Water Powered Retractable Garden Hose Reel,"Great product at a great price! Prior to purchasing the Water Powered Garden Hose Reel, my wife struggled every time she tried to use our outdoor hose. Now, with a simple shift in the retract lever, the hose rewinds itself effortlessly. Since the Water Powered Garden Hose Reel is rather light, a tip on its use is to sit on the box during the retract cycle. This stops the box from shifting during retraction of the hose. We catch the water expelled during the retract cycle into a 5 gal. bucket & use it to water potted plants outside the house. All-in-all we couldn't be happier with the product!"
2,Great while it works,"I've owned this product for about two years. It has seen no winters and has generally been used about once a day during summer months. I have 100' of medium grade hose installed.Initially the unit worked very well - it fully retracted all the hose and I made sure never to let it bind up at the end. This summer the unit started slipping and pulsing. After disassembling it, I noticed that not only was the large plastic (very poorly made) sun gear cracked, but the unit leaks internally. It is now completely useless.For $ 85.00 I thought I would get a few years out of it. All the good reviews in here are in for a shock when their units start failing (which they will).If your a fan of nature, you might be impressed by this units ability to safely house a number of different interesting insects."
2,Nice while it worked...but not for long,"Purchased one year ago at Home Depot for $89.99. It worked well for about 6 months then gradually got more and more difficult to unspool the hose. After about 9 months, unspooling became impossible(required two people to yank on the hose and one person to sit on the base to keep it from moving) and rewinding slow and weak. I will never buy another suncast product again. Expensive junk."
2,batting .500,"I bought two No-Cranks, although different models, one has a swivel base, the other fixed. Pretty sure the internals are the same. 1st works great, the 2nd, poor. Squeaks and binds, particularly difficult to unwind.Unfortunately I thought the hose was the problem, and didn't return it. I disassembled it, suprised at the number of internal parts. Found nothing wrong, probably just poorly designed, or maybe the manufacturing tolerances. So I'm batting .500, and wondering if it's worth a few bucks to buy another."
3,Good introduction book,"The book covers the basic retail products very well, but don't expect highly sophisticated products."
2,Narrator boring,"The guy reading this GREAT adventure novel almost put me to sleep several times. The reading of a book needs to be interesting. Inflections, accents, etc. are necessary. If you pay me, I will narrate a book for you. I may even do it free the first time, just to show you my chops."
5,Works great!,"This product works exactly as stated. My son is very big for his age and has outgrown his baby bathtub at age 9 months. I now bathe him in the regular tub, but I was worried about my son hitting his head on the spout, even with padding he would have hurt himself. Of course, I still keep an eagle eye on him, but now I don't have to constantly grab him and move him away. I would recommend this to anyone, perhaps even to use when bathing pets!"
3,Ok reading but print way too small,"I like to read while on the treadmill, but it is difficult w/ this book. The print was way too small. I wish it were offered on the kindle. That would have made it more convenient. It is an ok read though."
1,destroyed,When I received this book it was completely destroyed. It looks like it has been through the washing machine. I dont know if I will even be able to sell it to someone else because it is so water logged!This was the most expensive book I had to buy this term and it showed up like this! I am extremely disappointed with it!
1,My 7 cats would not eat!,I have 7 cats and all 7 cats refuse to eat it. What good is a product that you can't get your pet to eat. Don't waste your money!
1,If the cat won't eat it,"With even the tiniest amount of this stuff in my cat's food, he won't touch it. Says ""You cat will love it"" on the package, but they should have added that some cats will hate it.That was $15 down the drain. I'll report to my cat's vet that his suggestion sucked. He should have given us a small sample to try out first.My cat is FIV with liver disease. We have to try whatever we can. Be warned that your cat may not love it either.This review is only on the product, not the selling company. The package arrived quickly and in good order."
1,Proactive is helping him preserve his sexy,"Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy. When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him. Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars."

2,Bad Boy for Life and Thats Real,"That CD is got to be one of the illest ever made by Diddy and The Fam. The hottest track on that is ""Roll Wit Me"" by 8-Ball,MJG, and the beat is off the hook. So if you one of those people who haven't heard that album yet go out and get it because you aint gonna know what you missin."
4,D-I-D-D-Y!,"Love him or hate him, you have to respect him. Diddy is the only one that can go thru what seemed to be a crumbling empire to rise and release his best work out of his three albums. The Saga Continues pratically rocks from the beginning to the end. Here's the best tracks on the album:Child Of The GhettoRoll Wit MeThat's CrazyI Need A GirlLONELYThe Last SongWhere's SeanNothing's Gonna Stop me nowIf you want this moneyIf you love rap with party beats, and a little R&B, this is the PERFECT GIFT! If you like street rap, more gritty and real, you may or may not enjoy this one."
5,p diddy and the fam who you know do it better,"p did is the greatest and he is back again with a rememergence of the bad boy family. i love this album, it is great from front to back and i think that everyone should spend some of their money to pick this up and check out musical genius in work."
5,EMULATORS,"This USB device is great for use with Emulators. All the drivers download automatically in windows XP and your set to go. Plays N64 and PS1/PS2 games on your computer almost like with the council. Great Accessory!Unlike some of the other reviewers I havent had any problems. The USB cord hasnt given out, and I run it on windows xp and it works fine. I dont even have a floppy drive on my Homebrewed computer so I dont know if the floppy it comes with works but it doesnt matter because xp downloads the drivers for you. One of the only N64 to USB converters, no problems, Emulate away!!"
2,Cute'nCuddly,Gave this to my granddaughter when she had her 4th birthday on Christmas Eve. She also lives in a home with a real live (also Cute'nCuddly) Goldendoodle doggie. She takes the plush goldendoodle to bed with her.
2,dissappointed,"I was very dissapointed as I had expected something exciting and contemporary and found the compilation boring,dull and lacking in imagination(IN THE PRODUCTION OF TO BE MORE PRECISE) and will promptly be attempting to sell mine on amazon and it is the only cd that I've bought that I've attempted to sell and I own a lot."
3,Some good songs,"I have to admit I don't like this trashy-group, but it has some good song in their set list."
3,Not sure if it works,I have used this item few times since receiving the item. It seems to calm the dog down but only for a short time. Can't really tell if it works or not since my dog acts in the same manner after few minutes.
4,a walk on the wild side,"Bashman shows us how script kiddies often do their nefarious work. Which is of a total unoriginality, whence their name. The problem has been that invariably, some talented black hat writes the base version of a script. Which then is gleefully disseminated on the Web.The book has some merit in showing how you, a sysadmin or Web developer, might look for holes in your website or code. It gives incentive, by revealing what can happen if those holes are discovered by outsiders. There is an entire darknet filled with these creeps."
4,"Taut, surprising thriller with a tinge of sadness","The plot of ""The Human Factor"" unfolds carefully, like a good spy thriller, but it's not filled with a wad of messy details or names. The main character is a man who has staked all for the love of a woman of another race, and he is trying at all times to prevent this risk from catching up with him. Although the plot takes place during the Cold War, and the machinations involve the US, UK, USSR, and apartheid South Africa, the story is highly contemporary and relevant. It's also gripping, intelligent, and heartbreaking."
2,3 Stars would be too generous,"I read this book few years after putting it on my list. It was largely disappointing. Better than average portrait of some of the characters (especially the head of the office), sub-standard plot that the writer never succeeded in making it interesting until the last third of the book. It seems more fit for a short TV show."
4,Good Enjoyable Read - and something to think about..,"This is an uncomplicated tale of cold war espionage told with elegant simplicity by Greene. It follows the fortunes of Maurice Castle, a British ex-diplomat working in the African section of the foreign office. When a leak is traced to within Castle's small team, his past is drawn into focus and his ordered life comes into contact with sinister players. Greene, who is economical in his storytelling keeps the cast of characters tight. Although the book is clearly dated, its simplicity allows it to remain compelling to a contemporary audience. The plot is simplistic, and this isn't one of Greene's better known novels however this is a great example of good storytelling. Thematically, the novel concerns the nature of loyalty and the presence of wrongdoing on both sides of the cold war equation. This is in some ways more interesting now more than thirty years on, as the sins of the cold war era become increasingly well understood."
5,Behind the scenes in restaurants.,"Jim Quinn writes about what goes on behind the scenes in a variety of restaurants - top of the line, a diner, a pizza place, a place at the Jersey Shore, a cheese steak shop, a Chinese restaurant, and even McDonalds. The first two pieces, on the diner and top restaurant, are fascinating. As an extra, he gives hints on what to look out for while eating out, and how to review a restaurant. An absolutely fascinating book, recommended for anyone who eats out."
2,Caution: Chet's Voice is Not For Everyone,"I'm a big fan of Chet Baker's music but had never heard him sing. I was very disappointed by this album. I find his singing to be flat -- all quiet -- , weak and void of emotion, not to mention that he has trouble reaching the high notes. Perhaps this style of singing was sort of cool and hip back in the 50's, but it leaves me cold.Musically the back-up and Chet's trumpet playing are great as would be expected. But beware, make sure you like his style of singing before you buy."
1,not what i thought,"this isnt a disney movie,i gave it away almost as soon as it came in the mail. it took a very long time for me to get it."
1,Garbage,"This is a total fake representation. Stay away from this one, it is garbage. It is not a Disney. Buyer beware of buying this junk."
1,beauty and the beast,"this was not the movie i wanted.very misleading due to cover of dvd. this is not the disney movie, i will be returing this to amazon,"
1,Not what you think,This movie is not the disney beauty and the beast. I assumed it was based on the photo. There is nothing stating it is anything other than the orginal. I will be returning this item.
3,Not Much Here of Musical Interest,"This recording, by pianist Joe McBride and his band, has received numerous favorable reviews in audio-related publications. At the risk of sounding like an old grouch, I must say that I am not quite sure what all the fuss is about. Yes, the sound is good, with plenty of bass punch and a refreshing lack of brightness, but my goodness, the music is some of the blandest lite-jazz stuff that I have heard in quite a while. It takes more than bass punch and definition to make music interesting, and this recording fails to deliver anything of musical interest. Actually, the most interesting thing about this release is that Heads Up is a division of Telarc, and the CD was recorded using HDCD (which is now owned by Microsoft, in case you happened to miss that bit of business news a while back)."
3,"Not as good as ""Sky Islands"" but worth buying.","Caldera, a so-called latin group, had deeply embedded brazilian and african musical roots that created beautiful melodies. Their introductory album was a very good start, but lacks the nuances of ""Sky Island.""For diehard fans, get ""Caldera"" but, for the rest of us, please, please have someone, anyone, transfer ""Sky Island"" to compact disc. My turntable needle is now, basically, scratching my favorite Caldera album."
5,Brings back memories...,These shows bring back memories of when TV was funny without relying on sex and/or foul language. The video and audio quality are fine. Watching these episodes are a great way to spend an evening with the entire family without the worry of children being exposed to inappropriate topics and language.
3,not quite what I was looking for.,"I have no previous ballet experience and was looking for an interesting way to improve flexibility and muscle tone and see if ballet held any interest for me. This struck me as something that would be great for those getting back into ballet. For me, the routines just seemed rather long and involved. Also, not being that skilled, it is easier for me to learn complex dance moves if I can watch the instructor from behind and see their front in the mirror (which I have never yet seen in a dance workout dvd.) There was nothing really interesting about the stretches so I did not really get what I was looking for. Having said that, I like the instructor so I tried the Ballet Boot Camp Stretch and got exactly what I was looking for!"
4,It's fun?,"I haven't gotten to work too much with this video yet, but Amazon is bugging me to review. It's a little harder than I had anticipated but once I get the combos and routines, it'll be fine. The workout is fun, but I was hoping for basically a difficult class structure that I could do at home."
1,Cheap arrived broken both wheel & Spices,Cheap arrived with broken wheel and twq spices also broken. Poorly packed. Not worth repacking & sending back
5,very nice,this spice racks just makes your kitchen look better it is very nice and also works well easy to get to and you can see all of the spices with just a quick turn
3,Unsure..,"I really like the bouncer but haven't had a chance yet to try it out with our child (not due for another month). The music, mobile, toys and colors all seem very affective for an infant. However I just put it together and the child activated feature (when baby shakes rattles the music/mobile is meant to start) does not seem to work. I'm unsure if I'm doing something wrong or if the item is defective. If anyone has any info with this please let me know before I return it..**** UPDATE:So the chair was faulty. Amazon shipped a new one and it works great. My newborn loves it. See my new review - 5 stars."
5,BEST Door Peephole Viewer I've seen,"I've installed several of these peepholes and ALL have functioned marvelously. They work best when there is LIGHT outside, so if your door faces a dark area of your yard without much ambient light you won't see much w/o a light mounted next to your door. Otherwise, they are quite impressive. They come in both plastic ($10-$15), as well as metal ($20-$25) and the chrome coating on the metal models seems to last about 3 years before it starts to bubble & pit. For the dollar spent, there's no more bang-for-the-buck that I know of in a device like this."
2,Better alternative,A better alternative is Bagusoft Password Safe. (www.bagus-software.de). It also has an AutoFill function and you can use it on a USB stick. It's cheaper than Norton and there's also a Freeware Version without AutoFill.
4,A good waiting spot,"I started in the middle of the series last summer-- enjoyed ""Irish Mist,"" so much I scoured my hometown and the internet until I found and have now read the whole Nualla series (in order). ""Irish Stew"" is not the best of the series, but if you were hooked from the previous books, you'll enjoy this one too. The only thing is that this one lives a little too much in the past and you don't get a lot of Nualla and Dermot, but the way he leaves you hanging as you go from the present story of Dermot and Nualla to Ned from long ago Chicago (same Ned as Irish Eyes) you find yourself hooked. I just hope the good father has one more Nualla story up his sleeve to quench my addiction."
3,Super Shopper,"First. the other reviews were not kidding about the screws. I have two to put togeather. I did the first by hand yesterday. Tonight...I will be using my power drill. Just to give you an idea, there are 7 drawers. Each drawer has 6 or 7 drill holes. That's 42 screws with just the drawers done! The cabnet has about 16 pre drilled holes. Thats 58 and counting! The top of the chest has 4 holes and you also need to put on the knobs,one each, another 7. That's a whopping 69 screw and there may still be some I'm forgetting to mention.If you really want this piece and it is very pretty, do yourself a favor...buy, borrow or beg for a power drill. Your arms and hands will thank you."
4,Good looking,"This looks like a decent piece of furniture for a put it together yourself job. Nice color. Draw stops. Fairly easy to assemble, just time consuming."
4,Easy on the Mahler,"While the ""Titan"" symphony might be one of Mahler's more accessible aural pleasures, it is not the easiest to conduct. The melodies bubble to the surface sounding as if they were spun out of silk, reminiscent of Beethoven's Pastoral 6th. But there is also an intense tension underneath that requires a certain amount of bravado to be convincing. With the edition of the original 'Blumine' movement, Atlanta's version of the ""Titan"" explores Mahler's scenic soft side. Yoel Levi's delicate direction pays off handsomely from the softest muted horn to the most jubilant climax. The Atlanta Orchestra plays as intently and joyously as you could imagine. Of special note are the dance-like 2nd movement (Kraftig Bewegt) and the stunning finale. Mahler's masterful orchestration shines on this Telarc disc. You will not be disappointed with the energy on this recording. It is Mahler at his most satisfying."
2,Half the price=Half as effective,"I tried this product because it was half the price of the Frontline we usually use, but the results were less than stellar. It was supposed to kill the adult fleas within 24 hours, but 4 days later my short-haired dog still had a number of active fleas. We bought the same brand for our cats as well, with similar results. If you want low price, then take a gamble with this product, but be prepared to waste additional money when you have to switch back to good flea protection."
1,3 Year Old Product ...expired????,"I purchased both 6 month bio Spot on for Medium size 31 to 60 lbs and 6 month bio Spot on for puppies, toys and miniatures under 15 lbs I have two dogs weighing 50 lbs and 56 lbs I also have 3 very small inside dogs. I used a good dip about a week before applying the bio Spot. It's been 30 days and the dogs all still have the fleas. I went into the bio Spot web site to find out if there was an expiration date because the packages I received were packaged in 2006 .....bio Spot says the product it good for 2 to 3 years if stored properly.Do The Math EXPIRED!!"
1,Epic Fail,"Bought a year's worth of bio spot and by July of last summer, our dog had fleas. We stopped bio spot and bought frontline. Frontline is worth the extra cost. We struggled to get the fleas/eggs out of our carpet, but even on the dog, the difference was between a lively, hard to grab flea and a slow moving, dying flea. Once we got them out of the carpet, we didn't see anymore fleas when using frontline."
1,Doesn't work well. Wasted money.,"I'm going to have to purchase Frontline. Still have fleas.Not a good product, will not buy again.xx xxx xxxx"
3,Must Have For Mobb Deep Fans,"Although it's not as sound in production and rhymes as it's sibblings: Hell On Earth, The Infamous, and Juvenile Hell. It's a must have for all of those that follow the Mobb Deep legacy."
3,Serves the purpose.,Needed them for nursing. They were a little uncomfortable at first and I really wish I would have gone with tie shoes. The back gets a little deformed from putting on and off and sort of rubs when wearing.
1,Durability stinks!,"I purchased these from an actual Skechers store in my area and at first I loved them. They were comfortable and of course easy to slip on. Now to the bad part...I have only owned these shoes for two weeks (today matter of fact) and already they are stretched to where they're loose and already cracking where they bend near the toes. My sister also owned a pair of these that quickly wore out as well. Had I known these were the same she had, I would never had bought them. Very poor choice of material!"
2,Skechers.,"I had to return them, I couldn't get my foot in the sneaker. They don't stretch wide enough to get you foot in them."
3,Not designed for large women,You will need to purchase a shoe horn to get these shoe's to slip on over your hill easily or order 1/2 size larger.
2,True size is not so,"I love Skechers shoes. In fact I have 2 pairs of the Skechers D'Lites Opal mules. I live in them and they are so comfortable. BUT thinking the D'lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes. Boy was I wrong. I wear a medium size 6. I ordered a size 6 for these shoes.My other Skechers are a size 6M. It was so painful trying to get them to slip on my feet. I have had other ""new"" slip on shoes that did not go on as tight as these. When I compared the front of this shoe to my other skechers shoes, my other shoes showed a wider appearance as compared to these. These were much narrower. I may try a ""wide"" version of this shoe but not sure. At any rate, I did not keep them and sent them back. The size is not true to fit in my opinion. Sorry Skechers you blew it on this style shoe for me. I'll stick to your mules."
2,ouch,"I have a high arch, and the top part is very stiff, i had to cut the strechy part just to finish the day. Not very comfy at all."
4,Skechers slip on sneakers,"Loved these shoes ,fit like a glove ,on my feet 12hours as a nurse and find the shoes very comfortable.would recommend to all nurses."
4,Good for aspiring geologists,"This book is very use ful, the only fault I have with it is that some pictures are in black and white so its hard to know what you are looking at. overall the book has been a great tool"
5,good,"I have not really heard many of Ambers other songs, but This is your night is one of the most spectacular songs i have ever heard."
2,Keep 'em stored in the crate,You might be drawn to this CD because of the interesting collection of country classics. There are a few gems in here such as the original recordings of The Wayward Wind and Six Days on the Road. Mostly you have very poor new recordings. Many of them are horrendous. Keep searching.
1,ZERO STARS THIS PROGRAM BITES,i have had nothing but trouble eith the norton firewall. it locked up my computer. then when i tried to uninstall it it wont uninstall. i keep getting popups from symanatec-little error messages about this every time i start the computer or change websites. do not buy this product......
1,don't pay for another XP (extra problem),"i got this product free thru promotion program & rebate. But i feel sorry to install this. I have to uninstall this after 1 hour using it. It's not simple to set up (another word, too much questions for setup), continuously popup, slow down you system and internet connection. Popup killer is not working properly.DON'T BUY IT"
1,Terrible,"Downloaded first for my notebook, this was okay although it dramatically slows down machine, why is it it needs to do a virus scan of a document already held on your machine?( Assuming already done full system scan and scanning all mails)Then downloaded version for desktop then my nightmare from hell started and whilst reasonably PC competent it was far too deep for me in what it was doing to my machine.It was bloody murder, nothing worked or if it did it took 3 minutes to open a file.My mail went AWOL and when i checked the status window it told me I had an error in the E mail setting but no idea as to how to fix it. User support was a joke ( especially from the UK) and now i decided to forget the money spent, do a system restore ( it didn't like it) to before i bought it and now wouldn't dream of letting it get near my machine again.Be warned!!!!"
2,White Anglo Saxon Protestants!,"Yes, and now the scariest band in the world, with the scariest name. It's hard to fault this album, it pins you to the wall, but only two songs have any kind of resonance, the totally toxic ""B.A.D."" and ""Sleeping in the Fire."" The rest is flimsy 14 year old angst; Blackie ingeniously spitting Alice Cooper back to a whole new generation of disaffected youth, before he would go on to his inward Who phase. Pushes a 3"
4,Classic Metal From Aging Shock rockers,"W.A.S.P. was one of the most controversial metal bands of the 1980s and continued to far less fanfare into the 90s and new millenium. Starting with the release of Helldorado I couldn't take them seriously any more as they kept on churning out albums even though they were past their prime. Their last album to be taken halfway seriously was K.F.D. as the band chose to update their sound, bringing in some electronic elements a la Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson. But their first album contains a number of classic tracks like Love Machine, Sleeping in the Fire, On Your Knees and Hellion. I don't get why W.A.S.P. was so controversial, big deal one swear word in the chorus of one song? With Headless Children they proved thsemselves to be legitimate musicians, and still even here a Marilyn Manson type shock rocker predating the now retired and aging Manson by nearly a whole decade."
2,"Good animated movie, but not much for 3D...","Good animated movie for humor and for kids, but if you are looking for a movie with spectacular or any great 3D effects, this is is not the movie for you. Just purchase it on regular DVD...because you arent missing much on the 3D.."
3,It was okay,"This film wasn't boring, but it wasn't amazing either. All in all, the film was cute, plenty of rather corny cheesy humor, but not too much that it was annoying or aggravating. The characters were cute, and it was a cute little adventure, just don't expect it to be on the same level as pixar's animations."
4,Fine Quality DVD; Cute Kid Movie,"The movie is cute enough, but I didn't appreciate the underlying women's lib propoganda. I have a son, so I don't mind him seeing strong women. However, I would not want my daughter to see the role of women the story promotes, because I don't believe it results in happiness for anyone involved. That's just my two cents' worth."
4,My boys enjoy it,My two boys (3yrs and 5) enjoy watching this movie. I have seen it bit by bit and it looks good.
5,Kids DVD,"I bought this movie for my son....and he loves it. I t's a very good kids movie, and it will keep the adults smiling as well, when watching it with the youngins....."
3,Susan (Ginormica) is a great role model for my 3 year-old,Sophomoric humor. My six and three year-old love it and watch it frequently. Reese Witherspoon has a great voice for animation.
2,Better in theaters until home 3D improves,"The movie has alot of potential, but the great cast couldn't pull it off otherthen a fair rating for story telling/watchability. You want a great story, go get ""How To Train A Dragon"". The 3D is only made for a short in the extra section, which was the main attraction for this film. Note: the 3D in this blu ray is crappy, no where close to ""Avatar"" level. In a 2D version, you lose visually/gimic for what the movie attraction offered in the theater.My suggestion is wait until 3D technology in Blu ray and TV improve and this movie will be much more enjoyable. Two and a half of five stars."
4,Hilarious,"Great family movie. Hilarious!! The only thing i didn't like were the sexual innuendos. Of course it is very inappropriate for children, but thankfully they probably won't catch it."
5,Great!,Cutest movie! I actually purchased this for a gift and ended up watching it too. I really enjoyed watching it.
4,"Fresno, Beverly Hills Cop & Close Encounters all in 1","Yes, people Fresno CA is just loads of fun....NOT It is Channel 24 NOT 23 and channel 24 is our NBC station. Loved the films comments getting the real meaning of this city in it.An enjoyable film. Did not care for anyone in the voice cast.But, it is fun and you do not have to be a kid to enjoy it.NOT up to the standard of classic Disney or Disney/Pixar films. Compare the film to the ""Ice Age"" films on humor, style, etc.Let's see, they used ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" music in the film.The President character going after a funny Bush....meaning NOT TOO BRIGHT.Military said they were holding some of the monsters for 50 years.....this character did NOT look that old.Just, as said above, an enjoyable film.Normal extras on it."
4,Great kids film,"My three boys really enjoyed this film. They have watched it several times now, and thoroughly enjoy it each time. It's basically a film about reject monsters (mostly scientific accidents) who are held in a special military compound (prison for them), and how they are eventually given the responsibility to defend the earth against an alien invasion. This film is entertaining and funny (especially for the kids)."
2,text book,"Hello, I'm a Pima Community College student. I choose this book to read to junior high students. This book reads a lot like an old text book, it was very dull and boring. I found it very hard to read and I also found it hard to keep the attention of the 7th grader that I read the few chapters to."
5,Jehan Sadat,"I loved this book. Mrs Sadat is a wonderful inspirationl woman who wanted equality and humane rights for all women, not just the women of Egypt.She has included so much history of her country, with pictures of her family, and the life of a woman of pride and determination."
1,Looks great... sucks otherwise.,"Unless you plan to have this fan professionally installed and/or if you value your sanity at all, DO NOT purchase this fan. the ""directions"", otherwise titled the owner's manual, although detailed, are written with these barely recognizable, sometime blurry, black and white pictures of the fan being installed. It doesn't specify what included screws or washers to use specifically where on the fan, so about 95% of your time will be spent guessing where to put what screw (and sometimes, if the mood hits you, you might want to throw on a washer). In a word, it's crap.Miraculously, I was able to get the fan up, connected, and running, but not without the fan crashing to the floor once and my having to reattach the assembly several times with a string of profanities, due to poor directions.Don't let the price fool you-- overall, it sucks."
2,Not as objective as it seems...,"Even though the book beautifully unravels the Arabian culture, there are some critical flaws in the way the book is written. Its goes on without any sense of apparent direction or meaning. Also while the author is fascinated and appreciative of the Arab culture, her bias surfaces every now and then as she belittles (no matter how subtle) other peoples from poorer Asian nations. That was a big turn-off. Overall a very fairytale view by a Westerner which is too good to be true."
2,too much of a good thing,"don't just automatically hit ""not helpful"" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinois"
3,75 minutes of leftovers from a 75 minute album...,"""Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois album shamelessly compiled by Sufjan Stevens."" Yep, the title pretty much says it all -- but it's a rare breed of workaholic musician who ends up with 75 minutes of leftovers from a 75 minute CD. Far from essential, but still irresistible if you love Illinois as much as everyone seems to (the album, that is...) A pleasant enough way to spend some time with Sufjan until the next state comes along... I'm hoping for Alaska."
4,Surprisingly excellent,"I probably shouldn't say ""surpringly"" excellent we are after all talking about Sufjan, but when this was released I was hesitant to buy it because I thought of a B-sides and outtakes album as not up to par with regular releases. I thought that if this didn't make the album then it must not be as good, that's pretty much the case with most other artists. Artists other than Sufjan. This album is really amazing and is absolutely level with his other releases. It should be looked at as an album and not a collection of outtakes . I highly recommend this to all Sufjan fans especially those who love ""Illinoise"""
4,Cool editing.,"That's a weird title, you might think. But just listen to the end of ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" by Lenny Kravitz. The original version ends with a drum and guitar hit. On this album, the hit is provided by Sepultura with their jungle-drumming and it sounds so cool! The album is full of fun little things like this that fans of the original -structure songs will appreciate (or despise, I guess). But hey, if you want the studio-recorded endings to the songs, you might want to buy the individual albums, because there are a lot of great bands on this album. For you people that like 80's pop, there is a VERY different version of Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love."" It doesn't have that electronic beeping in it though. Overall, this is a pretty heavy album and isn't for everyone. But for those who appreciate creative noise-making, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better compilation."
1,oh oh!!!!!!!!!!!,DON'T waste your time on this herendous crap!!!! don't buy his first either. nothing is useful on this cd apart from the absolutely stunning 'absolutely'. the rest is rubbish. ooow my ears hurt. guide:-Good songs: 1/19Bad songs: 18/19Best: shown aboveWorst: foolish (by far)
2,It Worked For A While...,I had this capacitor installed in my wife's Explorer hooked up to an old PPI 1400. It worked ok for awhile but my lights still dimmed but just not as much. I had it in for about 8 months when all the sudden my subs stopped working all together. At this time I did some back tracking threw my system and come to find out the capacitors ground was reading as a weak positive but basically the cap took a crap and stop working all together. So O would not purchase this capacitor ahgain looking for big results. Sorry but save your money.
3,Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway,"Enjoyed the CD. Was not please with some of the songs on the CD. Liked 5 out of the 10 selections. Regardless, I still enjoy other songs that this duo have produced together or singularly. RIP Donny!!!"
1,Causes Errors ( not even worth 1 star ),"I bought this 4 days ago. After I installed it I began to get error messages every other minute. It also disabled my MSN8. After spending the entire weekend loading and unloading programs, formatting my hard drive and installing windows twice, I discovered that it was the System Works that was the problem. I am returning this today."
1,Horrible successor to Systemworks 2003,"I could have put up with the product activation, but this new version of Systemworks only half-installed, now I can't get either the old version (2003) reinstalled nor the new version reinstalled. Can't reinstall Internet Security 2004 either. Symantec deserves to lose money on this release, it wasn't ready for prime time and I wish they would compensate me for the hours of attempting to get this piece of garbage to work. Diskeeper 8.0 and McAfee Internet Security Suite 2004 will do almost all that Systemworks did and much more reliably. If you have to clean the registry, try MaceCraft's RegSupreme and for cleaning out old files, try McAfee QuickClean. I've used Symantec products since the early days of Norton products and this was a big disappointment."
1,Don't buy this,I feel compelled to say: don't buy this junk. I bought it on the reputation of Symantec. What a disappointment. It'll ruin your good computer.
2,"skip SystemWorks, buy AntiVirus","I have used Norton AntiVirus for years and never had a problem with it; I installed SystemWorks and had to shut most of the utilities down because it slowed my system down to a snail's pace. Now I only run the AntiVirus and everything works fine; unfortunately I can't return SystemWorks.Also, if you submit a rebate form for this product, don't expect to actually receive any money back from Symantec. They will conveniently misplace your proof of purchase."
1,What a pity,"Norton user since the early 90s. Probably ex-user now.- Activation *grrrr*- won't LiveUpdate - getting error msg. 'net connection OK tho.- Will demand the CD again and again when nothing has been changed. Installs maybe 2 byte - whatever.- Slows down computer to a crawl.- NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE V2003! I mean, goodies like Processviewer and Passwordthingy are nice, but besides that it's exactly like 2003 with the year number changed :(- Doesn't even uninstall completely.System: XP Pro SP1, nothing fancy installed.No, Symantec. That's not how you treat your customers of almost 15 years (which is also the amount of time I know my oldest friends - go figure. I saw Norton as a virtual 'friend' too)."
4,perfect,"Got this for $20 cheaper than my local dealership had it for. Came with clear and easy to follow instructions, I had it programmed within 10 minutes of getting it. Shipped fast, and got to me quickly and undamaged. The battery did die sooner that expected, but the dealership had batteries for $4.50. I am very happy with this product."
5,The Fox; The Captain's Doll: The Ladybird ( Penguin Classics),"A classic collection of short stories by D H Lawrence, a true literary genius whose prose spans the ages. The Fox stands out as a rich descriptive tale of two women living on a farm whose compliment of animals are primarily female as well. A man shows up, hunting foxes and stirs sexual urges within the loveless women causing the women's sedate feminine environment to become heated and unstable. Lawrence, with a sparkling eye for detail and subtle nuance weaves a tale rich in allegory and sexual symbolism that captivates the reader while exposing the human instinctual animal by stripping away the cultural facade"
3,Largely disappointing.,"I enjoyed Ostwald's book on Schumann so much that I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it is something of a disappointment. There is little ecstasy or tragedy in his treatment of Gould. About the only new angle he applied was getting in touch with every doctor that ever treated Gould (and there were a lot of them) to give a more detailed account of his medical and psychiatric history than was available before. Otherwise, he largely rehashes previous ideas and writings about Gould (especially the Otto Friedrich biography). A pity that it did not live up to the standard set by his Schumann biography."
5,4 Years and still going Strong,"Love this printer, bought it in 2006 for office use and 4 year later I have moved it around 3 times and its still going strong!"
2,Disappointing,"Our five year old HP 2100 was relocated out from under us and replaced with this model. I miss the old one. I wanted to like this machine; it is quicker by a good amount. It seems less likely to jam when doing two-sided copies. There, I said something nice about it. Here comes the rest. The main paper tray does not accept envelopes. You're supposed to feed them one at a time into tray #1, a cantankerous option at best, as my success rate with that feed is about 50%. I'll second the earlier report about the occasional need to shut down and restart. The print on ours has begun coming out crooked despite properly set guides on the main tray. The back side of the pages smudge with toner resulting in unacceptable back-to-back printing. I'm looking for an alternative and suggest the same to anyone considering this model."
1,hp tech support is horrible,"I just bought this printer.Cannot set it up needed tech support. Tried all routes and options wasted 8 hrs for nothing. Will never ever buy from HP.""your tech support is horrible"""
2,HP Hates Mac,"HP doens't love my Mac. It often won't print at all unless I use the ""print"" command within the application I'm using - pdf reader, especially. Then, if I print from three different applications in one day, it gets all befuddled and freezes up. It's also prone to paper jams, somthing I never experienced with the free Epsons that usually come with MacMall Macs.The driver was very difficult to install.I had read about these problems, but thought folks were being fussy...On the bright side, it's always on, and it's fast. And I'm learning alllll about its insides!"
1,Death & warm fuzzies just don't mix,"To give this as a Christmas gift as one reviewer recommended is sick & morbid. While it may be a topic we need to deal with more openly, this approach sugar coats the ideas of loss, grief and pain. To love someone and watch them die, or face imminent death yourself is not a process that one can follow out of a book. It has to be lived - and no one can tell you how to do it. The author fails to honestly address the fears, and pains of death, instead telling us to ""live our eulogies"". Get real woman! Death & warm fuzzies just don't mix!"
2,Commentary very Liberal,"The Code itself seems complete, but the commentary has a very liberal (Americanized) interpretation. If you want commentary that is more true to Catholicism and acceptable to the Holy See, choose the older more expensive version put out by Caparros, Theriault, and Thorn which was published by Wilson and Lafleur Limitee. If you are a supporter of the values of EWTN, you will be disappointed with this book."
1,A 'DOWNGRADE' FROM NSW2003!,"NSW 2004 Pro consists of few changes from the 2003 version (for example, Ghost is still v. 2003) except for in Antivirus 2004. Like others, I have been frustrated by the problems that Norton Antivirus 2004 creates on my system (dual P4 1.7 Ghz CPUs, 1 GB RDRAM, so speed shouldn't be a problem). It conflicts with several other programs, causes the system to hang, requiring a reboot, and is generally a pain. I'vbe tried turning off some of the new scans it does for adware, etc., but that doesn't fully fix the problems. NAV 2003 worked great. It's bad enough having to activate the product. I wish I had stayed with NSW2003 and bought another year of virus definition updates, as I ended up uninstalling this piece of junk and reintsalling NSW2003. On the bright side, the uninstall seems to have clean up my registry enough that NSW2003 shows another year of virus definition subscription."
1,Phew!!!,"I'm amazed this product gets such good reviews by the experts. I have a modicum of experience with computers and software and am unable to recommend SystemWorks.Like others, I've had nothing but problems with Norton/Symantec Products. I've had to re-format my hard drive on more than one occasion for issues I felt Symantec not only caused but should have been able to prevent (the problems can be found on their website and were known issues prior to my version of the product). No free tech support--not even for installation issues which I have found to be frequent. Advise against the purchase of this product!"
4,still love norton,"after reading the review's i allmost didn't buy this copy of 2004 pro., but i'm very glad now that i did. would have rated it 5 star's if not for ghost being so hard to work your way from start to finish. the anti virus part is still the best and even better. ghost work's but you may have to fix so thing's on your computor and make a gdisk on a floppy along with your cd's it is a 9 cd long image for my hard drive that is 11gb used space. the rebate was the fastest ever, had it back in just about a week and a half."
4,great improvement after rafi's revenge,"at first i thought ADF was barely a hype due to their members' backgrounds&political standpoints,also rafi's revenge was not powerful enough,but this time ,i'm really into ""community music"",the india-sound is funny with cool big-beat & dub .this is a music to dance to,to listen to,to read to,&to ......whatever u like."
3,As always (too) ahead of his time,"Much like his album ""3-D Lifestyles"", which sought to breach the gap between hi-hop and jazz, this record seeks to do so with spoken word and jazz. An assortment of poets recite alongside Osby's stylings with varying degrees of interest and effect. it's a project that would likely be wholly embraced now, what, with the surge in popularity in poetry nowadays, but at the time went under the radar because it had no general audience. It's a wild record, careening over various styles and rhythms in true Osby fashion, but maintaining a sensible edge.If you like poetry recordings, you'll dig it, though you may not play it much; thanks to Osby, it's a thinking person's poetry record, even if the poetry doesn't always reach the levels that the music does. Get it used."
5,No Problems with Norton SystemWorks/Personal Firewall 2004,"I'm not a computer geek - all I want is complete protection against viruses and hackers and Norton gives me just that.Apparently most of the reviewers have experienced some problems after installing the Norton product, but since I encountered none, I have to wonder if it was the Norton software or something else. Although I have noticed that a decent amount of RAM is helpful in order to prevent Norton from slowing down your computer.I have been using Norton for the past nine years and never had any virus problems or intrusions on any of my computers. After you install Norton and you can pretty much stop worrying about viruses and hackers. Updating virus definitions is a breeze thanks to ""Live Update"".It's just getting better and better over the years. I can only highly recommend this software."
3,"Like the look, but quality questionable","I like the way they look, mostly with shorts cuz they kinda look funny with jeans, but the insole isnt even sewn down. Its a cool idea and I support it because of what they stand for but make a better shoe"
1,Don't bother,"This book tries to cover all aspects of e-commerce on the internet but stays at a ""dummy"" level in terms of educating the reader about the specifics. It lacked depth and was too general for me to get anything out of it. Plus it is cluttered with many outdated and annoying web references that detract readers from the chapter readings."
5,great shoes!,I've had the same pair for almost 2 years. The tread is almost gone but they still look great after cleaning them up. It is time for a new pair though. I wear them as casual shoes. You can loosen the laces up and tie a knot at each end and they look great and are very easy to slip on and off. Great buy! I recommend them.
5,The most comfortable shoes,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. It almost feels like walking on air. They are very stylish, durable and COMFORTABLE! I love them and I feel like wearing them all day. These are perfect for practically anything - work, gym, sports, etc. Its a classic for a reason. Buy it before its gone forever."
1,Meh....,Used it for a two weeks then threw it out...Pro's:InexpensiveGood grip on my iPhone 3gSuctions well to windowCon's:Cheap plasticArm is way too longWobbly
2,Need to find a better solution,"I tried to use this to hold my iPhone on the heater vent on my cars dash. It was very difficult to get it's various parts to slide into place, my phone often pops out of it, and it was almost impossible to get it attached to the dash vents. It would pop off the vents frequently, and within a few months it managed to break three of the little vent slats. That has been fun. My heater vent is now completely broken, no more direction control at all.Sometimes I'm a little hard headed, so I tried to keep using it, because dammit it should do it's job. So I tried to use it on the other vent. Luckily this time the clamps on the back of the actual holder broke, instead of the car vent pieces.Time to find something that actually does it's job."
4,"My first one broke, but the second one seems better","At first I was very happy with it. It was exactly was I looking for. After 2 1/2 weeks, the gears inside stopped working. So the right side would be as far open as possible while the left side was closed. However, that is wider than my Droid. When I took it apart to see if I could fix it, one of the gears that had been glued on was no longer working. When I wrote to the company they quickly sent me a replacement and I've started using that. I just hope it lasts longer because I REALLY like it."
3,quality of subtitles and format,"The movie was brilliant, although it left me wishful. I wish that it was in wide screen and that the subtitles were properly synchronized. If anybody can tell me if it was possible to get wide screen copy, PLEASE, with a hard on, let me know!"
5,Great book!,Don Mance (the author) gave me a copy of his for Christmas a few years back. (I used to be neighbors with his parents). I have read it and liked it a lot; however now it is time for me to pass the book on to my ailing brother. I am hoping this book will help pull him through this rough patch he is in.Thanks Don! Tell your parents I said hi and I hope all is doing well!Brooke
2,Is it an ORIGINAL CD?,"Lately some CD labels are producing their CDs using CD-R. This CD in particular has this small problem. I think that both, the CD maker and the seller, should warn in advance the client about this situation. I can produce a CD like this one at home for less than one dollar. In a few words: it is far away from an ORIGINAL CD."
2,Robert Carroll,One of the movies ( A walk to remember ) will not play all the way. I purchased a laser Lens Cleaner and cleaned my dvd player. This did not help! Other movies in the pack plays well.Robert R Carroll
4,Great Deal,This was a great deal but I didn't like how the dvds came packaged. They were stacked on top of each other instead of in 4 seperate areas like other 4 pack movies. But of course I love the movies.
5,Hawthorne 4-drawer chest,"This is absolutely my most favorite item I've bought online -- and I buy a LOT of things online. The wood (solid REAL wood) is just gorgeous, and all the parts are superbly engineered and fit together beautifully. The assembly takes a little time because of the drawers, but it's very easy, and as I said, all the parts fit together the way they're supposed to. The drawers slide in and out smoothly, it's solid, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another product from this company!"
4,"good, but not up to gangsta's paradise",coolio's latest album is alright but some of the songs just didn't make much sense.
3,Rubber Leg Tips,"The product was in fine shape, and it arrived in a very timely manner; however, the product was out of the package when it arrived within the Amazon box. Not sure how that happened. If I would have ordered a different product, it could have been problematic."
2,Muted!,"It's quite obvious the author has a lot more to say. . . as I've cross-referenced other books, including those written by Myhra.Just as the other reviewer had criticized (with regard to Germany's use of captured B-17's), this book is for the amateur historian-that's to say, what the author says is available free off the internet. I'm being too critical? Well, wouldn't it be interesting to know the branch within the Air Technical department which constructed prototypes which were made using ""recycled"" allied plane components? KG200 was part of this, too. It's a good book-but not for someone who really knows about the true WW2- on the periphery."
2,The disappearing MP3 player,I have a 5gb but a lot of the H10's are having the same problem. I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent batch of Bechet performances. ""Summertime"", ""Muskrat Ramble"" and ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" are the best tracks in an overall excellent disk."
1,They wouldn't let me give it 0 stars,"Normally I wouldn't bother with crap like this but I'm sick of people comparing this to Alice in Chains. I, myself, listen to good music i.e. Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails, L7, Soundgarden, R.E.M., Beck, Hole, Mudhoney, etc... Don't any of you get sick of hearing people complain?? Life isn't that bad. These kids put on all black and whine and get a record contract. I don't remember Nirvana ever having to cry this much to get a deal. Listen to something good. Nu-metal sucks and it's spreadin like hairmetal in the 80's (Poison). IT ALL SOUNDS THE SAME! Go buy Superunknown or Vitalogy. Listen to somethin decent n quit goin by what Hot Topic says is cool."
5,LOVE this Singer,"I heard ""Wish We Never Met"" on the radio one day and went right out and found this CD...the whole disc is amazing. Very bluesy, throaty songs -- in the same category as Sheryl Crow. You can see her in all sorts of recent movies such as Nurse Betty (the best friend of Betty)and Pay It Forward (the AA sponsor).I heard she has a new CD called ""Shiva"" but I can't find it anywhere...if anyone knows where to get this, please post a review!"
5,It made my heart pound with anticipation!!!!,I like what one of the other readers said about how well she presents the facts and at the same time you can draw your own conclusions. This book resembles a family in the area where I live and I'm going to share it with that family and maybe some of the things in this book can help the family keep trying to find out what happened in their situation. I was very intrigued by this author and couldn't put the book down. It felt so real that I cried at the ending. I wish there would've been a little more current information on how Jo and Larry Dillons health was doing after it was all over. It was a great book and I plan to read more of her books.
1,good product,"I love the product. I have had it for a couple of weeks and everything works even better than I expected. The voice sound quality on the phone is good, and equally as good with the blue tooth headset. It syncs perfectly with MS Outlook, the web browser is great for a wireless device, and my email is easy to read. The Qwerty keyboard is wonderful. A little small, but easy to get used to.My big complaint is that although it says a rebate is available it is only available if you don't transport your number from your old carrier. Now who doesn't have a cell phone number that they want to keep? A 13 year old who is getting his or her first phone? The buyer is not told about this until the phone arrives.I tried to post this comment a week ago, but the thought control people here on this site wouldn't publish it. Interesting, no?So bottom line, buyer beware."
5,The Three S's,Went from a 7290 to a 8700. I can't even begin to tell you about all the improvements.The three things that are the most noticible:1. The Screen - It's amazing looking.2. The Speed - Not only the processor but the EDGE data/web browsing is ultra-fast.3. The Speakerphone - Crystal Clear and Loud!
4,"Good Data device, Poor phone","The 8700 is an outstanding data device for checking e-mail browsing the web and keeping in sync with outlook. Some additional features like a MP3 player, storage expansion, and voice activated dialing would make it the perfect data device. The 8700 is a below par phone. The mic seems to pick up any background noise and is often not usable in a noisey environment. I don't know if there are quality issues, but my first 8700c died after 4 months of use. Bottom line... If you can use another phone and have the 8700 as a data only tool it is good, if you need a good cell phone first... keep looking."
4,Wrong track listing,"NOTE: Amazon's track listing is wrong. Correct track listing is: 1. Papua New Guinea [7"" Original - 3:47]; 2. Papua New Guinea [Andrew Weatherall Mix - 9:43]; 3. Papua New Guinea [Graham Massey Mix - 3:45]; 4. Papua New Guinea [Hamish Mcdonald Mix - 5:04]."
5,Simply Elegant Demitasse Spoons,"I am thoroughly evjoying my Gingko Leaf Demitasse Spoons. They are perfectly weighted, so they feel great to use. They also add a touch of elegance to my morning coffee. The bowl of the spoon is a good size, not too large,not too small. They also clean up nicely, retaining their luster. These demitasse spoons would make a lovely gift to someone....or even to yourself! I had looked all over online, but couldn't find anything as nice. I would highly recommend them to other other people looking for demitasse spooons"
5,"Balancing the ""spooky"" with science","I just finished re-reading this amazing and unusual book. A friend of mine who suffers from sleep paralysis (she is interested in any books about dreams!) recommended it to me.Most books that I have read on the subject of dreams are either too ""out there"" or offer too little practical advice that I can incorporate into my dream life. Dr. Conessa Sevilla's book presents a well-balanced scientific, practical, ""spooky"" story, not only in regards to sleep paralysis, but about lucid dreaming as well.His book also incorporates narratives of individuals who have experienced these dreams.Some of the more psychological (bio-psychological or Freudian)explanations he offers, I must admit, were either new to me.Finally, Dr. Conessa re-interprets the sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming experiences from the point of view of aesthetics.Cordially,J. Rodman"
1,Defective - drained batteries in seconds,"I received this product as a gift, and fresh out of the box it drained two sets of brand new AAA batteries in seconds.As I am now overseas, the exchange process became understandably tricky. However, the people at Meade support were not very helpful and promised me things they could not deliver.They also package the exact same product with the ""Simmons"" brand name, so beware of that product too."
3,Editorial Comments from the Publisher,"Farce Spoof Mystery. 3m / 3f / interior. STORY: ""Lights up to reveal the suspicious corpse of Mr. William Black. Upon seeing her recumbent husband, Henrietta White Black exclaims, ""What a pity! Now you won't be able to go to that clambake on Saturday."" Who could've been so crazy to do the rich old man in? It could be anyone, after all, everyone is carrying a gun. Is it Henrietta's brother, who just happens to be hiding behind a curtain, wearing Elizabethan clothing, carrying a gun? Or perhaps it's Muggy Brown, Mr. Black's garage mechanic, who simultaneously is hiding under the coffee table. But then, it could be Tom, the youthful, bare-chested stage manager. With the help of Gabby, a part time policewoman housewife, the two women go about stumbling upon clues until the killer ...well, it's an ending you'll never guess."""
5,"Pleasant, Motivating Music","If you enjoy modern piano music, this is a must for your collection. This album is great while reading or cruising the web."
2,i don't believe the reviews,"firstly I would like to know the great reviews this book got were written by actual users or just few fellow artists who were friends with the author & obliged her.This book talks abt. everything yet when you finish it you are not a dime wiser. The section on design prinicipals in particular is either lifted from some other book or written by someone else. The contrast in the language is too evident .Besides this it's non effective , you don''t get an applicative understanding . Read stuff on internet that this.Plus the paintings(done by the author) have a cheapy glaze look to it.I am a beginner I found book by Patricia Seligman a much better book..teaching you in a practical way .People please write true reviews and it should represent your opinion and not for obliging friends."
4,One of my favorites!,"This is a comprehensive book well worth your time and money. I especially like the instructional step-by-step color demonstrations which include still life, landscape, and figures and portraits."
4,very usefull book,"I am an adult beginner exploring watercolor painting. This book has really good information about getting started. I especially liked the information on paint characteristics, perspective, color value, and focal point. I have purchased booklets from my local hobbie shop chain that are much more expensive and give less comprehensive explanations. I found this book very helpful."
4,Great buy!,"Great buy! I have always wanted to buy this book and when I did, I wasn't disappointed. I loved the book. I liked the movie."
4,Sherlock Holmes 4 Pack,"Never has there been a better pair to play Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson like Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The relationship between the two is what makes this pair timeless. Their loving sarcasism reminds me of the relationships between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker or Spock and Scotty. The famous line ""elementary my dear Watson"" will forever be the trade mark of these movies. Holmes is forever amazing his friends, the bumbling Inspector Lestrade and Dr. Watson, with his astounding deductions. Because this series is dated, they seem a bit corny at times. People sometimes drop like flies right under his nose. These faults are all over looked when you are enamored by the duo. Elaine Leithiser"
5,Very addicting,"This was given to me by a friend to listen to. I am not that big of a fan of trance music. But this is very addicting and great to listen to. All the tracks are good, especially the tracks by Bypass Unit. I would definately recommend this to other people.My favorite track is the 6th track. To reiterate how addicting this is, my 6 year old daughter is into it now.Also, the cd cover is a wicked hologram."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This is one program I wish I'd never bought! If I could rate it 0 stars, I would. I had nothing but problems after I installed it and System Works on my computer. My CD R/W drive stopped working, and I could no longer print from the Web.But even worse was the firewall itself. Even with it enhabled at the lowest settings, it prompted me one right after another about the inbound ICP addresses to the point where I could not do anything on the Internet. Even selecting Permit did not stop the onslaught of prompts. There was an option on 2002 that allowed you to turn the warnings off, but it was apparently either removed from this version or too well-hidden.Plus, there was no option to uninstall the program as in the earlier versions. Once I got it off my computer, all the problems I was having went away.With so many obvious bugs, it makes me wonder if they rushed to get it out without doing a thorough beta test."
5,A great gift for that special girlfriend!,This is a fresh approach to the oldest subject in the world. Lou really understands what it Takes!A really good read for you and your girlfriend.
5,"""THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN FOR WOMEN""","This is a must read for every woman. It takes you to the height of power over a man you never thought you had. It is informative and very forward. When you read this and it will be more than once, it is unbelieveable what can happen to your sex life. If your relationship is on the rocks and you want to spice it up, read this. You will see the difference in your man. You have the power after reading this and at the same time does wonders for you. Have read many other books and this is the ""ONE"" and only to have. It will be your bible. I have given it to other women and actually have laundermat seminars talking about this book. Your man will actually look forward to the attention from you and you will be rewarded. BUY IT NOW!!! As they say knowledge is power and ""oh boy"" it sure is."
5,A Musical Masterpiece,"I am one of the people that jumped on the Juno bandwagon after Shango, and I have been a huge fan ever since. I recently had the honor of purchasing this CD off of a longtime friend of mine (the same friend that got me into Juno) and I am eternally greatful. This recording is nothing short of amazing. Songs like Guardian Angel, Ice Cube, and Samurai pulse with energy, while other tracks have just the right mix of smooth ambience and spacey experimental sounds that makes this sound more like a great piece of art then a simple CD. This is quite a hard album to find, but a treasure that no Juno fan should go without. Ignore the naysayers, Beyond the Infinite is nothing short of amazing."
5,Best Album Ever,"This is one of the most creative, energetic, and altogether amazing albums ever!! A must for any techno/trance fan and for anyone for that matter! EXCELLENT ON THE DANCE FLOOR DJ'S!!"
5,The Best Coming of Age Film I've Ever Seen!,"Yes, I admit, it's nowhere near as good as the book, but it's a great satire that shows the difference between how adults think and how children think. I liked the songs and I know you don't see people walking around singing them like you do for the Sound of Music, but you don't see them singing Willy Wonka songs either, and this is just like it. The actor who plays the Little Prince is superb (although hard to understand at times).If you're reading this now, then you've probably already seen it. I want to tell everybody that this movie exists and how good it is for a rainy ay if nothing else. And hey, isn't it due for a 25th anniversary rerealease?"
4,Cute Film... some details differ from the book,"I bought the movie because I love this book and use it as supplemental reading material for my seventh graders. There are so many literary elements I could teach with this book/movie such as plot, character traits, symbolism, theme. The kids find this book amusing and generally enjoy it. The movie portrays the prince exactly as I thought. The film is musical, which I didn't expect, but still enjoy. Unfortunately, some of the characters on the other planets were totally different from that of the book. Overall, it's a good buy to compliment the book!"
3,"Yes, but Potter's field??!!","Eric sounds like a terrific kid who grew into a terrific man, but I wish I knew a little less about his mom. Did we really need to know that she bought a beach cottage and that she familiarized herself with the bars and restaurants around the hospital? Then when it came time to bury her son she thought it would be a kick to let the city bury him in Potter's field and to call it ""the family plot."" I hope someone had the heart to do more for him."
5,eric,"This book is very good, I have read it in dutch, now my husband has cancer I read it again and again in englisch because my dutch book is broken."
1,Would not Buy even for Ice.,1. Cover fits loose and Will Not Stay ON.2. Pick will eventually PULL OUT of Handle and super Glue is a Temporary fix.Its NOT Locked in or Glued. Just a Hole with a smaller Diameter than the Pick and forced in.
5,Yeeeaaaah!!!,"Just a great album to listen to and get one's jazz on to. Love the title track. The album does not get old. Every track is great in this music fans humble opinion. If you are a fan of jazz and piano, this is awesome."
3,Arbitrary Selection,"These tracks are wonderful, but so are some of the other tracks on the original albums. If you want a sampler of his best, ""The Best of herbie Hancock"" is a better starting point."
3,Havent had it long but not as great as I hoped for.,I haven't had this long enough to give it a fair review but I will say the ceramic rods get gunked up very fast with metal from the knives and it makes it not sharpen as well as it does clean and I have not found a good way to clean the junk off the rods completely yet so that is not cool. Maybe brillo pads will do the trick?
4,"Very Fast, Highly Compatible Memory Card","I purchased the SanDisk 512MB Secure Digital Card for use in my MP3 player (Rio Cali-256). I had never before seen a Secure Digital card and was surprised at how small the card is.I opened the package, inserted the card into my MP3 player, and presto. Instant recognition. No need to format the card.I started downloading my music files onto it, and noticed the speed was equivalent to the memory onboard my player. As a result, I now have an additional 120 mp3 files on my player!I'd give the product five stars, but the memory size did not appear to my MP3 player as 512MB. It was slightly less than this - not too much less, but when I buy 512 MB, I certainly want all 512."
2,Get a Faster card,"this one is too slow for my Sharp digital camera, takes a seriously long wait between pics."
1,"Was great for a month, then died","For no reason, it just stopped working while loading music onto my MP3 player. I don't do anything rough with it, I just set it on my desk and listen. A big disappointment. I'd recommend another. Might as well go cheapest, if you can't trust the one with the brand name."
4,Very Versatile,"As long as you have a computer at your disposal, this little trinket is excellent for storing all sorts of information. Not to mention, 512 MB is kind of a lot of storage capacity. Believe it or not, 512 MB is hard to fill up when you're taking movies--and especially when you're taking pictures.If you're looking for a handy dandy storage device, this is the one for you."
1,BAD quality! stay away!,"I bought this (Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digital) in February and gave it to my mom as a gift in May. She used it in her digital camera and took pictures with it for her college reunion. Afterwards, the card displayed ""Corrupt Data"" and the pictures were lost! Do NOT buy this card, if you do not believe me, do a search for this card and you will see similar testimonials!The grief and sadness this card has caused me is not worth its cheaper price!user be warned!by the way, the one i have is made in china, i have read these ones are the WORST"
1,TECBUYZ = THIEVES,"don't buy ANYTHING from them, they'll take your money and will not send you the good. i'm not the only one to say that, appartently. please check their rating.they suck!!!"
1,slow card,"the people who wrote this is a ""fast"" card have no expertise. this is now one of the slowest cards out there, this makes a huge difference with cameras over 2 megapixels. if you are shooting with a three or four megapixel camera it will be unbearably slow.price. please! the page shows a list price of two fifty. wow so for fifty five it must be a great deal right? no! memory prices fall like a riock and the list price is from two years ago. the listed ""sale price"" of fifty five is the going rate across all the competition.Indeed sandisks own ""utra II"" version of their 512 sd card is sixty five dollars everywhere. the ultra II reads and writes on average seven times faster."
3,Sandisk camera memory card,"I ordered a Sandisk 512MB memory card for my camera, thinking it would be exactly what I have now. When it was delivered to me it did not look like my old memory card or the picture that was advertised. It works fine but the label in the memory card says Wii. Need to change the advertisement picture for Sandisk Camera memory card."
5,great for my mp3 player,"I love this 512mb SD card, its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a 1gig SD card too.works great with my GPS unit."
5,Memory Card,"As expected, the cards arrived promptly, well packaged. They are providing an easy method to view our Great Grandchildren's pictures on a viewable screen."
5,Great Card. No Problems at all.,I use the Sandisk 512 SD card in my HP 2215 IPAQ. I have never had a problem with it and it gives me plenty of space to store all of the music that I enjoy. I would love to get a 1 GB card but I want to wait for the prices to come down a little more. This card is fast but I would still like it to be faster. I'm not sure if it is the card slowing down the process or the USB connection to my IPAQ. I was thinking about buying the Sandisk ULTRA SD card to see if there is a speed difference.
4,WARNING!!!,"This is a great selection of songs, but be warned that Tribal Dance includes dubbed voice-overs. Also, many of the tracks are mixed together so that one blends into the next. If you are looking for clear breaks between tracks, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,kamichu,"Saw this last year on Youtube. Animation is very well done,especially the accurate landscape shots. This a a very cuteslice of life anime with inventive fantasy elements woven in. Yurie's school life is complicated by her two girlfriends attempts to benefit from her new godly status, and Yurie's tentative romantic pursuit of a clueless maleclassmate whose first love is calligraphy. A very sweet andoriginal anime, highly recommended for those tired of mechas, swordfights, and ecchi stuff.Herb the Librarian"
5,A good reminder of some great times...,"""The Art of Live"" has been, for me, the ultimate souvenier from a series of concerts that I thoroughly enjoyed. The CD version of the project is accurate to the sound of the shows, as very little (or no) studio touchups and overdubs seem to have been done. The audio is almost an exact replication of the 2.0 audio track on the DVD. The only differences between the two are the tracklist, and it should be noted that the list here on HMV.com is incorrect. The encore duets w/ Dream Theater are NOT included on the CD version, and ""Anybody Listening?"" has been ADDED and is only available on the CD. I would recommend this release to any present-day Queensryche fans."
3,McConnell and Brue: Economics,"An economists book that does little for the aspiring Economics student. The reader must have a background in Economics before reading this book, and should be accompanied by with a lecture when used for instructional purposes. It covers a great depth of economics knowledge that is useless unless you are planning a degree in this field. Five stars for the ""nose-in-the-book economist,"" and zero for he or she that wants to learn a little more about econ."
2,OUTDATED,This book is full of racists comments and is extremely outdated... I know I must keep in mind when it was originally written... I guess I was just surprised.
4,hands!,"hands, hands and more hands in all sorts of positions. if you're looking for hyper realistic hand reference, then this is not what you're looking for. i think it's an awesome reference book!!"
3,Why this book might matter,"This book serves, as one must suppose Cahill intended it to do, as an intriguing introduction to the culture of the Ancient Greeks and their continuing influence upon Western society. Cahill's choice of wording tends to jar at times: ""yip-yapping"" and ""woo-woo wave"" for example. He rather goes over the top in trying to make this book as ""cool"" as possible. And his quotations from Yeats and others throughout the book presume a level of cultivation with which this cutesy verbiage is at odds. Still, one could do much worse. He manages to convey, at times, forcefully, some of the most significant and powerful currents of Greek art, thought and culture. But, in the end, the best way to learn about the Greeks is from the Greeks: Thucydides, Plato Euripides etc. If this book piques your interest at all, I would recommend picking up any one of the fine translations of these authors' works. If not, well, I suppose it's all Greek to you."
3,SAILING ON A DARK WINE SEA,THIS BOOK IS OUR NEXT BOOK CLUB BOOK AND I AM HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE GETTING INTO IT. I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD BOOK ONCE I AM ABLE TO GET INTO IT.
1,thief !!!dont buy from this selller,"hi im a student going to nursing school in californiai ordered a nursing handbook ""Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses"" nearly three months ago but it hasn't been delievered yeti tried to contact both the seller and amazon.com but nothing was donedont waste your money on this seller!!!!!!!"
3,Getting out of date every day - Not a Mac CD,I use this in nursing school and am finding a new edition is needed. Many new drugs commonly used are not in this eighth edition. I also am disappointed that they advertise the CD rom as Windows or Mac - clearly not usable in the Macintosh. :(
5,Whoa...,"I didn't expect all this. I had planned on getting a yoga dvd with a little more kick, so i could get a bit of cardio in at the same time. Well, this had me sore the next day, I couldn't believe it. The guy instructing made me try harder than i normally would at home, and i even sweat. This is definitely the best yoga dvd/tape i have ever done. If you're looking for a workout with yoga benefits, i would recommend this one!"
1,Delusional at best.,"This book is pure fantasy and apparent industry propaganda.It's apparent that Dr. Barrett has not done any REAL research into this illness. His ""arena"" is psychiatry and therefore he HAS to make EVERYTHING he ""researchs"" fit into that ""label"".When doing research you can not be biased and it seems Mr. Gots is only looking at industry and not medical research into this disease. As Mr. Gots is firmly involved with the chemical industry and has been for years.If anyone wants to see how industry COVERS UP it's own tracks, then this book will surely bring it home.If you are looking for the TRUTH and the DEVASTATION that this illness is creating worldwide, this is NOT the book for you."
1,Maxell DVD+R pk (9634056),"A spindle of 100 was ordered and sent to me,not packed very good at all,so of course they were all over the box and spindle was busted up,broken and some got scratches,so never again for me."
1,1/2 Good 1/2 Bad,These worked well until halfway down the stack upon which time my videos started skipping and displaying error codes. I will not be buying this item again.
1,Sloppy handling makes for a poor buying experience,"I have to say, the discs are great. Never a problem and quick to copy.That being said, it appears that no matter which brand of balnk DVD or CD I purchase from Amazon, they are ALWAYS poorly packed resulting in destroyed ""hatbox containers"" and sometimes discs even loose in the box. I have written to customer service, but if this continues (as it has for about the last year) I'm going to give up a few bucks savings here and turn to local retailers. I'm sure some of the blame can be laid at UPS's doorstep, but if theye were packed right, I don't believe the problem would be so overarching."
5,Unbelievable Deal,Extremely high quality item. Very sturdy. All installation methods were well described. Smooth retraction. Looking for a cord reel from same company. Used in a Automotive shop. definitely PROFESSIONAL USE quality.
5,THE Best ReBoot EVER!,"This is the best animation I've seen from Mainframe Entertainment. The story is fantastic, the art is beautiful (Daemon's Lair is absolute eye-candy) and as usual the parodies are hysterical. If you love ReBoot this is a definite must-have. If you've never seen ReBoot you may not understand some things, but you can still enjoy it. I recommend buying the entire third season (Volume 3, No. 1-4) and watching it before you see this DVD. The third season is just as good as this season and is definitely worth buying.As for the sound issues that some people have mentioned, I just bought this DVD from Amazon and did not notice any sound problems. All of the character's voices sounded just like they did on television. It looks as if the manufacturer has fixed the sound problem."
3,It's ok,"Yeah it's pretty close to marine corps warefare, there's a couple finer points they woops'd on, but for the most part it's pretty good. Graphics kinda suck. Game play is fun. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's just coming home from the suck, it could trigger you pretty hard, but all things being equal, it's fun enough."
4,Simultaneous outputs,"Nice enough player.The user interface is plain - nothing more than text, without the polish of Sony combo units.Ignore the editorial review's comments on needing a receiver with analog inputs. This player does provide analog outputs for surround, but it also provides optical output for connection to a receiver that decodes its own surround sound.The machine has one standout capability: when playing a DVD on progressive scan, the VCR/DVD line outputs are still active and correct! (Many current players will disable the line outputs when set to progressive scan [e.g. Samsung] or they will scramble and become unusable [e.g. Sony].) This is a splendid feature if you are driving an HDTV monitor and a ""normal"" TV (i.e. one in another room) simultaneously. (Admittedly, if you don't use this arrangement, this feature has little value; but for those who do drive dual monitors, this is a critical feature that is rarely found.)"
1,Not Right,"I think that it is pathetic for one of the authors to actually review and rate his own book. It seems as if this person is obsessed with selling as many copies of his book as possible. This type of greed is exactly what he pretends to be writing against. It is also wrong for someone (perhaps also one of the authors), to attack another reviewer, just because he/she did not like the book. These things say a lot about the author/s of this volume."
1,Boring,"I am sure some remarkable documentaries will be made about the tragedy of Sept 11. Sadly, this DVD is short and boring, just some sort of minimalist performance art piece."
2,Skip this one,"If I had remembered to read reviews on [an online internet store] before I bought this, I would have saved my money. There is zero human aspect here, devoid of voices or people. This video is really just a camera panning across building fronts, broken windows and ground debris after it was all over and no one was around. No chronology, no sensible order of footage. The only human contact is when the cameraman walks past a group of firemen, but they are just sort of standing around their firetrucks. As a viewer I din't feel I was participating, as a matter of fact I felt disconnected. Be aware that 90% of this footage is just panning the streets hours later and the next day. Absolutely silent with no one on the street. The helpless fear we felt that day is not expressed. This DVD is not worthwhile."
5,Good Toy,"My dog absolutely loves this thing, and he goes crazy when he hears it sing. The snake one is especially good for dogs that chew constantly, since my dog will easily break a soundbox within a day of getting a toy and this one is still working for past two years."
5,Rainy Dog a fantastic movie,"A fine articulate good movie about mobsters and horror you will ever see ever see The story is that Yuji carries out his business - shooting a mobster from a rival gang as he eats dinner with his family. After receiving his fee, he takes home a comely young hooker named Lily (Chen Xianmei). While they are getting to know one another, the boy sleeps on a piece of cardboard in the rain, snuggling up to a stray dog. Amused at the kid's tenacity, Yuji eventually throws the boy a towel. Later, Yuji stumbles upon a briefcase full of money while taking out a rival godfather. With the cash in hand, he plots to take Lily and the boy someplace better. In the meantime, the trio flees to an isolated beach in central Taiwan, hoping to escape the bloodthirsty gangster on their tail. Has sfantastic shot outs and one of the best horror movies I seen 5 stars exumondo ,fantastic a grand movie."
3,The lid cracked after a few uses,It worked well. Really sped the marinade time. Unfortunately I was using today and the top shattered while pumping the air out. Bad design?
2,Good While It Lasts,"The bowl is a bit small, but this marinater does work well--while it lasts. As has happened to so many others, my lid cracked after only a few uses. Did I pump too many times? Maybe. But this device needs either a stronger lid, a weaker pump, or a vacuum-release valve. It simply costs too much to be so prone to breaking in normal use.I emailed the company about getting a replacement lid. $9.99 for the lid plus $11.54 for shipping to Seattle; just shy of what a completely new unit would cost.I'm generally a fan of Vacu Vin products, but I'm looking for a different brand for my replacement marinater."
1,3 uses split lid,"I purchased this item on 7/1/11, and have used it a total of 3 times, and have always hand washed it. Imagine my frustration when attempting to use it today and had used the pump a total of 4 time, and the lid split in half with a resounding thud! I would have thought the item would have lasted through more than 3 uses. Have contacted the company to see if they will stand behind their product and replace the lid. If not, then I will be purchasing another instant marinater, but it won't be a vacuvin."
2,Review of Devil's Own,The format was to large for a letter box film. The actors didn't fit the screen so you loss a lot in the viewing.
3,good action film -- excellent performances!,"Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances in the Devil's Own. Definitely worth buying if a fan of either Harrison or Brad. I did not think the story line was very original but it is interesting enough to keep the film very enjoyable, given the outstanding acting throughout."
4,How to talk Irish . .,"I thought this movie was somewhat good, and I am currently reading the book. The whole Protestant and Catholic war thing really put the movie in a whole new perspective. The movie was so riveting just thinking about what such idiotic people can fight about in the world today. That wars been going for, what, 600 years now? I think it's time for an end. You people are on two different islands-why don't you just leave each other alone? Anyways, I think Brad Pitt was somewhat good, but I think they should have used a real irish person-say Sean Patrick Flanery ? and if you ever really want to pick up the irish accent . . .this is the movie to practice with."
3,Take it from one who knows......,"Right....I come from Northern Ireland, and I'll tell you right now most people writing reviews here (apart from a couple, you know who you are) don't have a clue what they're talking about.This isn't a great movie but it definitly isn't a bad one either, its flawed but worth watching.And you aren't going to understand ""The Troubles"" by watching a movie, you need to do some serious reading, its complex.And....Brad Pitts accent is fine, probably the best I've heard from an American actor in a mainstream movie."
5,"Terrific, High Quality VCR!","My wife and I are up there in age, you might say, and we wanted to replace our 10-year old Sanyo Hi-Fi Stereo unit that gave us good service but kicked the bucket. This Panasonic VCR is terrific! Beautiful sound and picture, helped by running it through our separate floor speakers and a Dolby Pro Logic receiver into our Panasonic TV. Love the large remote that easily fits the hand--and you can aim it at the VCR from wide angles, instead of having to use it point-blank with many remotes. ALSO, tape rewind starts out fast but gradually slows to a crawl before it completes the rewind--saves tapes from pulling off spindle! We've got a lot movies on VHS as well as family films, and this does everything Panasonic says it does. I suppose later on we'll get a DVD player and add some more speakers for surround sound--but right now we couldn't be happier with our purchase of this VCR."
4,Good party rap album,"This is really a good album. I have never seen the movie which it is based upon. I found this by accident at the local library. I was stunned by the ""Soldier's funk"" by Mia X, which had hot beats and gritty sound. ""The Game"" is a rare track with many skilled rappers (EWF, Big Mike, Eastsidaz, etc), which you will find nowhere else. ""All good"" is an excellent blend of Rap and R'n'B to sit back and relax.All in all, a very pleasant album, which skillfully mixes old school rap tracks with more modern, mainstream R&B.; For all tastes!"
3,Very enjoyable,A very good review of the history of the canadian airborne experience. Lots of pictures from the begining (1st canadian airborne battalion) to the end (disband of the airborne regiment)
1,DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY!,"The worst-Case Scenario Card Game series is awful. I actually threw them away (not worth the time or expense to send back). Really, what were the producers of this product thinking???"
5,Tiller Emirically and Scientifically Proves THOUGHTS CREATE REALITY,"EXCELLENT DVD! However, be warned, it is dry.But as a scientist and engineer, I deeply enjoyed this dvd and seeing how he set up his experiments to prove that our intentions CHANGE REALITY.In this DVD, Tiller shows that holding the intention is important and having a strong emotion attached to the intention adds Power to the intention. This DVD shows how holding the intention has an immediate effect on reality whether it be changing the pH of a water sample, or speeding the maturation process on a colony of fruit flies.From an empirical and scientific perspective, Tiller proves, ""WE CREATE OUR REALITY""."
4,Great options for the price,I purchased this product as a gift. The first one I got from another vendor did not play DVDs. I sent it back for a refund and thought I would get another brand. I came up empty looking for a player that had the options such as an SD card reader and USB port as well as the large screen size. In fact for this price this was the only one out there that had the features I was looking for. This one arrived and worked right out of the box. Very useful and the gift recipient loves it.
5,Great purchase,"The CD was in great condition, as described, and it arrived pretty quickly after I placed my order. Thank you, I would totally purchase from this seller again."
1,Woof!,"Inferior sound of interminably repetitious re-issues of truncated Albert Hall Reunion Concert bootlegs. And the 5 songs on the cover do not appear in any of the sample tracks or the listing, bad dog!"
4,Nice playable edition,"I used this edition for a Messiah Sing -- I played the continuo part. A lot of page turning, but it worked out very well. The print was small but legible. Like all Dover big format music books, it really is worth having them spiral or ring bound for practice or performance use. An additional $5 spent at Staples rebinding it makes the book very user friendly."
4,Print WAY too small,"The book is compact and easy to work with, but the size shown does not allow the reader to realize that the print is microscopic! Only purchase this book if you have EXCELLENT vision! Other than that, it is a great value, and there is nothing wrong with the book."
4,excellent,"In the very early 1970s, Miles Davis was at one of his production peeks. He was recording albums faster than Columbia could release them, and when he finally crashed in 1975, the label had reams of material in the vaults.Big Fun could now be thought of as an early 1970s sampler for the master. It was first put out as a double LP and goes from 1970-74, releasing material from all the collectives Miles assembled fromBitches Brewto an even more dizzying army of players fromOn the Corner.So went life in early 70s music when it was common to issue two or three albums annually. Miles moved so fast this contains psychedelic jazz and Corner funk. \All of this material is worth getting, but if you are a serious Milesphile, the album is not needed. All this has been issued on the Complete boxes, and these three essential sets, the two aforementioned albums andA Tribute to Jack Johnson, present a much more linear and organized view of this material and are worth the investment"
2,All show no help,"This book dose a good job telling you were things are, but thats about it. It gives one 8 step process on how to draw the head, thats it. It dosnt give you any of the help that i thought it would, it dosnt explain the basics of drawing the head. It gives you a few rough, do this and it should be fine, but dosnt explain what 'this' is. I wouldnt sugest this book unless u just want to leard about the anatomy of the head, not if your looking for techniqes as the cover sugests."
5,You Won't Believe It....at First!,"This book has some of the most scientific strategies in existence! What struck me about this book, was that this stuff is new, really new. So many books make this claim, in the end though, they are usually the same techniques from years past, just used in different examples.I have purchased many of Kevin Hogan's products over the years, and.....I HAVE NEVER BEEN LET DOWN! I can tell you this; buy this book, and the moment you see something about the release of a new book by Hogan...GET IT!"
5,Crammed with useful information,"This is a great book. It has applications to many walks of life, in fact I can't think of someone who wouldn't get something from this book.The Science of Influence is a science in much the same way as there is a (biomechanical) science to tennis: the theory is one thing but it takes practice to make it work for you. Hogan's style makes reading the book a pleasure and an education simultaneously, and for those willing to develop the skills there is much that can be applied to great effect in life.An easy five stars, heartily recommended."
1,Awful,"I saw these guys in concert (a festival style/ outdoor show) and had heard they were supposedly original and innovative. It sounded like a bunch of high school kids up there [goofing]around and making stuff up for an hour. Never once did anything ""new"" or ""original"" come from the stage. I realize I may be above the target age of this group (probably 11-17 year old males) but come on, these guys are horrible. All songs blended together into a perpetual headache, and I couldn't wait for them to get off the stage and would have left altogether for their set if not for the ""no re-entry"" policy of the concert."
4,One of the greatest,"""Quality Control"" is one of the best albums to come out this summer. It has tight beats and phat lyrics. J5 is not afraid to stay oldschool and true to thier music. All 15 tracks are worth listening to becasue they all have there own unique sound. Not to mention Cut Chemsit(resident dj) is one of the best in the industry today. So all you J5 fans this is what we have been waiting for and if you aren't a fan then you best give it a chance or you are not a true hip-hop fan."
5,Warped Tour hip-hoppas,"The Dopest LA. collection of rappers that flow from their soul, and two DJs that cut it up to the sun goes down.. a must buy if you are a fan of spearhead, KRS-one, and all the other artists and groups that keep it real throughout the years. Commin at ya with the old school stylee."
5,Quality control,"J5 never ceases 2 the hotness.this album is ill.from trax like great expectations,quality control the influence and 1 track only availible on the australia release long road to glory every single rhyme they drop is tongue twisting.i've been listening to these songs for a year and a half and I still dont understant some of the metaphores.pick this 1 up along with their newest LP Power in numbers that 1's ill 2."
3,Stones Country NOT Country,"I WORSHIP The Rolling Stones, & think this is a poor job of album A&R. The quote ""country"" songs the Stones originally cut include Back Street Girl, Far Away Eyes, Sittin On A Fence, Factory Girl, Torn & Frayed, Loving Cup, etc. They shoulda put more of these deep cuts on this recording..."
2,Very inconsistent performance,"I purchased this item because of it's competitive price and positive reviews. Installation was very simple and the card was up and running within 15 minutes of opening the box.After an hour of use, the card stopped working. After a restart the card worked again, but it will consisitently stop functioning whenever I am downloading files over 10MB, or leaving my computer on for more than 30 minutes.I've tried reinstalling the latest drivers and software with no success. I have a brand new Dell precision tower.I will be replacing this card as soon as possible."
4,High Palatability Box Turtle Food,"This was the first and now final commercial food I use for my box turtles.The bad news is it has more food coloring and preservatives than any other box turtle food out on the market as well as glucose. When moistening the food you have to make sure to drain it thoroughly or else it will become gluey and pasty, making it undesirable. This product also has a high amount of animal protein. Great for baby boxies, but most ideal to mix in other food as well.The good news is that there is something about it that makes it as sought after as bananas. They all just go nuts for it.Add in some dry pellets along with moistened upon serving as to help trim their beaks if you have nothing for that."
2,Fan shroud bolt don't fit,"Not a bad looking radiator for a OEM clone and the install went fine until I tried to attach the shroud to the radiator. The holes in the radiator were too big for the bolts! I had to go to the auto parts store and buy 4 body bolts to reattach the shroud, at a cost of $8.(almost 10% of the cost of the rad!) How hard is it to make the holes the right size? It makes me wonder what else they failed on."
1,"never, ever buy this!","what junk! sounds good but really horrible printer worst one i ever bought. buy this,and you be sorry. slow,noisy,eats ink like its candy.try cleaning the ink cartridges and it wastes so much ink,you will not believe it.worst of all,it spits ink all over the page for no reason. i sent a copy to epson while trying to get it fixed. even they couldnt believe it, but did nothing.i cant stand this company or this printer"
3,Shaolin v Manchu again and again (it seems),"The Drunken monk, Mark Long, and the 13 Pole fighters of shaolin come together to hold off the forces of the Manchu Master played again by Alan Hsu(golden crane). Another well choreographed monk film, with an alright plot. Worth a watch."
3,Product was not a new product,This product what I received was not a brand new one. Some body returned it which they send meVenkat
4,DeLonghi Good Value 4 $$,"So far so good. Makes an XLNT cup of espresso using LaVazza crema e aroma beans. Easy to operate and change settings to taste. Water tank seems small and little too much plastic but all other brands have same. Dollar 4 Dollar good value when compared with other machines made in Italy. Paid $612 w/shipping. Heard that Costco had a few for $489 + tax , therefore pricing was good. Hoping it gives me the service that my Saeco semi-auto gave me over the years. Not sure I will part the Saeco just yet."
1,2 expensive repairs in 30 months of ownership,"I have had this machine break twice for no explainable reason. Repairs have been related to the ""boiler"" and ""generator"" and have come in at $600. The machine is only used by my wife and I. Its descalled monthly. I seriously have no idea why my machine is so fragile and neither do the Delonghi authorised repairers. I have no doubt it will break again so I am looking for another brand.On a positive note the coffee tastes good, heat-up is quick and cleaning easy. It could do with a larger water tank though and I guess a more powerful pump so as to heat up the milk faster."
2,Horrible customer service,"Makes great coffee. A tiny rubber o-ring broke and they charged me $20.00 to send a new one. It quickly broke again, and when I called again they wanted to charge again! Got it for free after making a stink. Before inserting it I went online andfound them on sale for $0.03 each. Unfortunately there's a minimum order of $5.00 so I'm waiting for delivery of 167 little o-rings. Better than getting ripped off for $20.00 again.Also another problem occurred soon after purchase. They told me they'd give me the ""white glove"" treatment by sending a box to send it back to factory for repair. Never arrived. Decided just to live with the problem."
5,Field Tested in Afghanistan,"I purchased the DeLonghi ESAM3300 prior to my Army unit's deployment to Afghanistan last Fall. We counted on the coffee maker to crank out roughly 30+ cups of espresso and coffee a day.The machine has been used and abused, and is still Soldiering on through extremely dusty conditions without fail. It has not needed any service (other than the descaling function every 90 days)... I highly recommend this product to anybody who is in the market for a high end automatic espresso machine. Durable, reliable, battle-hardened, and combat tested-- this espresso maker is Army Strong!"
2,"The drink from the machine is tepid, not hot","I have same experience as Banshee. He posted his opinion on 11/30/2010. Unfortunately, I did not read his review until I received my machine and found the espresso it made just not hot enough and went online to look for answer. And, yes I have tried to preheat and rinse my cup and end result is ok but not that good. Same as him I ordered this on-line after reading many reviews but reviews and ratings missed the major and most important issue with espresso/coffee machines - the drink from the machine is tepid, not hot. I know this because I have a Saeco Royal in my office and it can brew a much hotter and flavorful espresso. Noise other mentioned is not a problem for me; they all noisy."
4,DeLonghi ESAM3300 Magnifico,"Capable of preparing espresso, coffee, cappuccino, latte drinks, and more, this super-automatic machine features a unique beans-to-brew system that grinds coffee beans right before brewing for exceptionally aromatic espresso. The appliance comes equipped with two stainless-steel boilers that provide excellent heat distribution, as well as an instant reheat function, which keeps the machine at an ideal temperature, no matter how long the interval between cups.Likes:Superb coffee!! Great crema, better than coffee housesEasily adjusted cup size & coffee strengthFAST warm-upEasy to cleanEverything works perfectlyDislikes:A little noisy.One of the Best Super Automatics Out There for the Price"
2,Unreliable,My wife and I were making approximately 6 Americanos and 2 lattes per day. After 2 weeks of usage the machine just stopped working. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.
2,(Not so) Magnifica,"Pros: Makes excellent espressoCons: Very noisy, monotone unsympathetic customer service (see below)Notable problems:2 months into ownership the water indicator light started blinking during the second preparation of an espresso. I followed the troubleshooting instructions, descaled the machine twice and performed a reboot of the motherboard as directed by customer service - all to no avail. I was then told that I needed to return the machine for servicing. No ""sorry"", no word on how long the servicing or shipping would take, no ""have a free bottle of descaling solution on us for the trouble"", no ""here's a coffee coupon to replace the pound and you burned through trying to work through the problem"".Too bad, it really does make some espresso..."
3,Good solid CD by Cy,"This is a good pleasent work by Cy. It's not a masterpeice but will please Fixx fans and the casual listener. It reminds me a bit of the Fixx CD ""Ink"". Probably because it has the same producer. I always enjoy Cy's real take on the world."
3,Vinylly mine,"You might dismiss CIRCLE OF LOVE lyrics such as, ""I gave her my heart, I was in love right from the start,"" as trite until the next day when you find these Steve Miller songs playing in your head! And the man can play - witness the guitar-pickin' on the title track. Then there's ""Macho City,"" Steve's musical take on modern Manifest Destiny that will challenge those who think he's all happy-go-lucky. I recommend CICLE OF LOVE but as I write this it is available only as a rather pricey import. Also, this 1981 release may not seem like much bang for the bucks - five songs totaling less than 40 minutes. That's why I'm glad I got my copy of CIRCLE OF LOVE used, on vinyl, for two dollars."
2,"catchy at first, but angst fades with age...","I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast."
4,"Great, Great Album","This truley is a great album. Most of JOJ's best songs are found on this album:Fear Of Dying Good, catchy song.Nazi Halo Great song. One of there best.Rabbiteen Again, one of their best.Strawberry Gashes IS their best song. Just one of those songs that touches you in all the right places.Vivica Good song that really goes nowhere. And it doesnt need to.Underjoyed Good catchy song. Grows on you.Star No Star Most people might say this is their best song. Its up thereLosing His Touch Really good song.Overall, i recommend buying this album- TODAY.It wont disappoint you."
4,"Melodic, heavy and aggressive.","I'd never really heard of Jack Off Jill before a friend of mine recommended this album, but I'm quickly becoming a fan. JoJ takes a bonafide metal approach - not Korn-ish ""nu-metal"" or the like - and makes it catchy and tuneful. My favorite tracks here are ""Strawberry Gashes"" and ""Nazi Halo"" with their relentless barre chord wall of sound and angry screaming (it's really more melodic and engaging than the words ""angry screaming"" would hint at). The musicianship of the entire seems to have suddenly grown by leaps and bounds from their previous album, which is also a compliment to Jessicka's songwriting and band leadership talents.Since I'm a man, most of the gynocentric lyrics examining the role women are forced to play are, frankly, not really something I can relate to. However, Jessicka's anger is not misdirected, and somehow manages to avoid the cliche fest it could have easily become."
4,Well worth the wait...,"I picked up this album after hearing Rasco perform live and I have to say that I was just as impressed with it as I was with his flow on stage. The album is filled with phat, head-bobbing beats and some sweet, memorable lyrics. Definitely an album you should pick up to sit back and just kick it to."
5,Catcher in the Where?,"What a book. A true depiction of the male mind, regardless of time period. I don't think I could thank Wakefield enough for writing this novel. It opened my eyes to the things I've been seeing all my life"
3,so-so,I thought the strangest things was one of if not THE best thing ive heard in years-this doesnt live up to it
3,One-off,"It's not everyday Boy George has a song not on a studio album, or even a soundtrack. This is not that memorable of a song, but at least not the computer generated trance/acid house he plays when he DJing. I have an Australian import."
3,not what i thought,"this was ordered on accident. I thought thy were real cigars. That was my fault, but the cologn really stinks"
2,Only one smells good.,"Out of the four scents only one doesnt make me gag, I cant even remember which one it is because its at work and doesnt get used much"
3,Not for me,".As a retired military I avoided odors for years. In the field a soldier must avoid being easily detected. Scented body products are common offenders. Now that I am retired, I decided to look for products with an attractive scent.Cuba Variety allowed me to test four scents. On my first test (a spray in the air), I did not like any of them. They each reminded me of room fresheners .Then I realized that any cologne will smell differently when it interacts with the human body. So I tested each (one at a time over four days) and noted my reaction.Both the Blue and the Red smelled to me like a sort of perfume and hence not as masculine as I wish. The Gold smelled fine, but the odor did not last long and reminded me of after shave. The Orange lasted longer than the Gold, but smelled a bit like flowers.One concern may have effected my results. I am disabled and not very active.Cuba Varity doesn't work for me, but may work better for more active men."
2,You get what you pay for,Hey its a cheap cologne and you can tell when wearing it. Maybe like one of the four scents but really dont plan on using this much more. Would recommend shelling out even 30 dollars for a half decent smelling cologne.
4,Fun novelty gift.,"Was very surprised by the fragrances. They are all different, they are all very nice. I like this product a lot!"
5,KILLER!!!,"coming from a 36 year old 80's heavy metal head. This cd is awesome! in the time of our lives, the bass lines of real fright, the solo in - in the crowds. the fuzz tone in it must be love, filled with fear and the guitar work in belda beast. This cd is worth every penny and i play this ""da vida"" and one song from scorching beauty ""the title track"" repeatedly and all SMOKE!VERY GOOD STUFF"
5,what?,"For somebody who tries to sound smart, this ""J. Talsma"" before me quite clearly is not. Metamorphosis, with the exceptions of ""Shady Lady"" and ""Stone Believer"", is in no way near as good as Ball. Likewise, Ball is just about as good as its two predecessors. Even with a change of line-up the band produced beautiful music of great quality, so do not be fooled by a bogus review."
4,Better Than expected,"Tale of woe is dynamite and ""mercy"" still sounds great. Cannonball and Nat, the Adderly brothers, are in top form."
2,Not as Funny as I remembered,"When I saw this show was in DVD I thought ""Great that was a funny show"". So when I dug up enough cash I bought it. So I started watching this and have made it through the first have of the first season and am now deciding whether or not I want to watch the rest of the collection or just pawn it off as a used dvd. Still deciding, but this one don't have much more time in my house. Look this show aint on Tv Land for a reason - it's aged and lost it's funniness.As for the show being edited. Look all movies are edited also. No big deal and I am sure what you are missing are the moments that weren't worth airing anyways. I found the missing two minutes on each episode no big loss."
5,It really does stay with you,"I also read this book a long time ago but find myself thinking of it quite a bit. Its resonance has mostly to do with the the well-drawn, believable characters and the thought-provoking plot of how a southern teenager tries to escape the world's impending ecological apocalypse. Alothugh a little bit overblown at times, it still was an incredibly gripping read. Too bad I can't find this book anywhere since I think its themes will become more pertinent in the coming years."
5,Truly a Blessing!,"This C.D. is truly a blessing. Not only for me, but also for my 2 daughters, ages 3 and 5. I feel so uplifted and happy when I play this C.D. that I transfer the spirit of love and joy to my daughters and we just sing together giving GOD all the glory and praise in song ""all our days long"". I just think, ""wow"" what a way to praise GOD from the heart in song and really feel the presence of HIM always. Thank you Lyle & Emmanuel. I am desperately awaiting your second C.D."
5,"The music on this CD is amazing, encouraging and uplifting!","I found this CD to be very uplifing. Times when I am down and discouraged, I can turn to this CD and allow the music and the words to remind me of the purpose of my spiritual being."
4,a primer for the uninitiated,"a close, ""academic"" reading of L.T. would render great many imperfections-factitious or otherwise. However, this is a freely associative account offered as post-structural fodder. When written in ('90) there was little stateside interest in situationism/lettrism/fluxus et. and scholars of the a.garde (i can only think of a handful) were slow to consider art/lit. movements beyond the hegelian arc. yes I had read ""society of the spectacle"" , knew of the lettrists work, dada, lautremont bla bla-all very predictable stuff for those in the ""avant know""-but what I found alluring about L.T. was its anti-academic, messy essence- a welcome shift from hackneyed scholasticism."
2,Salut!!!,"Il y a un paquet de gens en France qui n'ont pas attendu Greil Marcus pour faire le lien entre les punks et les situs. Sinon le livre est très interessant d'un point de vue documentaire et historique. Quant au coté politique des situs, il est tout simplement passé à la trappe. Les surréalistes sont classés d'emblée dans le camp des staliniens. Bref il vaut mieux lire directement ce qu'ils ont écrit pour se faire une idée.Enfin, s'il y a un endroit ou je n'acherai pas ce livre, c'est bien sur ce site (pour tre un brin fidèle à l'esprit de ces gens).Tchao."
5,a great workout!,"I found this tape to be great. I have lots of workout tapes and this one is definitely challenging. The only thing is, they don't have you do enough reps. What I do is pause the tape and do more reps. But the exercises are first rate, and the combos they do are challenging as well."
4,Crunch-Boot Camp Traning,This video is great! I've been working out with videos for years and was looking for something different. This video gave me what I was looking for. My favorite part? The push-up combos! They really work the upper as well as the lower!
2,"Not worth the $, IMO","The instructor barks her orders like a drill sergeant, that's for sure. The problem is that if you don't already know what ""out out in in"" means (or if you, like me, can't even understand what she's saying) you might feel a little lost and in over your head. It's very fast paced, but not actually long or strenuous enough to inspire a sweat. I have tried many times to make myself enjoy this DVD like most of the reviewers, but I don't. Just my honest opinion. I'm sorry if you don't find it ""helpful""."
3,boot camp is fun,"i like this video, the NY chicks had fund and made me fun like i was having fun while working out, this is a decent video and should be tried"
1,Much better analysis exists,"A much better and more recent text on the same subject is ""Mind vs. Money"" by Alan S. Kahan.Hofstadter is actually part of a ""panalienated self- proclaimed priesthood"" that actually wish to destroy democracy in the most democratic country that has ever existed with their own incapable aristocracy. Typically disappointed liberal art type academics, the intellectuals are not actually smart or gifted (in the sense of Jefferson or Franklin) but rather crypto-priestly wanna-be's.Since Reagan and the fall of Marxism/ Communism, the anti- capatalism that actually define Hofstadter's ""intellectuals"" has come under hard scrutiny. Kahan details the move to the ""green"" movement (BTW, I personally prefer non- intellectual T Boone Pickens on the energy subject) and the new anti- Americanism the newest batch of alledged ""intellectuals"" promote."
5,Oldie by Goodie - arrived early in excellent shape!,I ordered this for a friend from Europe and also one for myslef since my college copy is long gone. This is an older book but certainly a valuable classic. I believe it was required reading at Stanford in the 70s.
3,Intriguing view of first year med school pressures,"Gross Anatomy is a view of the world that most people don't see... the pressures associated with the first year of medical school, particularly that year-long anatomy course. Obviously, some students will make it, and others will not. This is a story of one who... well, I'm not going to tell you how it ends, of course.Matthew Modine, as first year student Joe Slovak, doesn't take med school as seriously as his peers. This is both the delighting part of the film, and the most unbelievable part. For Joe Slovak really doesn't seem to care at all, and that makes no sense unless the director gives the viewer insight into this mindset. That insight never comes.Funny at times, and tragic at others, Gross Anatomy was entertaining."
4,Stephen Housden Solid Rock/Jazz style guitarist,"I really liked Stephen's playing when he was w/Little River Band, he is also a [very] good ""Jazz"" style guitarist. A different type of album here.. good listening..wont blow tour socks off, but good stuff...easy on the ears!"
1,Legal Poision,2 Ingredients = Monosodium Glutamate and Wheat GluetonTwo of the most avoided human food consumption indegredients.You could go out and buy a bottle of accent flavor enhancerJust wow !
1,Doesn't work,I used this 20 years ago with a different dog and it worked great. But this time it did not work. I don't know what changed.
1,Made my dogs sick,"this product made my dogs have very bad diarrhea. i would not recommend to anyone. one of my dogs got so bad that he was bleeding and we had to take him to the vet, now 350 dollars later they are doing fine and im throwing away the forbid."
4,Great book...disappointing ending,"I have been a fan of Coulter's books for a while now and many of them are very good...not the best but good. They often follow similar story lines, rapidly changing, under developed characters and have simple, choppy sentences with many grammr mistakes but overall the adventure and action usually make up for it. However, she struggles to finish out the sub plots- especially in this book. There were many questions I had when I finished for it ended so abruptly. I was really unsatisfied with this book despite the fact that I gave it a higher rating and I wished she would have explained more about the various plots and people she included but never finished out. Overall it was a book I could not put down but the ending left me with too many questions and very disappointed"
5,The first book in a thrilling new series.,"Jack Dwyer lost his mother in a car accident when he was just ten. Nine years later, Jack and his older sister Courtney run Bridget's, an Irish pub and restaurant in Boston. When Jack's best friend Artie is brutally murdered, he is devastated, as is Artie's girlfriend, Molly. But soon, Jack and Molly begin to suspect there was more to Artie's death that simple murder. When Jack is visited by Artie's ghost, he discovers that his best friend's killers were the Prowlers, an ancient race of beats that can make themselves appear human. And to make matters worse, the Prowlers have marked Jack and Molly as their next prey - for no human can discover the truth and live. Now they are fleeing for their lives, and must take one last, desperate chance. The odds are against them. But Jack and Molly are determined to survive. This book started off a thrilling new horror series for teens. I highly reccomend this new series."
5,"""UNA TEMPORADA EN EL PARAISO INFERNAL THE FANGORIA""","A very dark but exelent cd 100%electronica,some really deep songs and really good beats,there songs about everything in here from a farewell song to a friend with aids(""CIERRA LOS OJOS"")to songs about the downside of being famous and glamourus(""EL GLAMOUR de LA LOCURA"")as well as sending subliminal messages about drugs(""ELECTRICISTAS"")and some great love songs(""A TU LADO"",""VOY A PERDER MIEDO"",""ME ODIO CUANDO MIENTO"")and all songs are great,way far from the punk days of PEGAMOIDES,KAKAdeLUXE and dinarama."
5,"This is the best anti-perspirant/deodarant I've tried, at a much better price than competing products!","This Almay product is absolutely excellent! I was very disappointed when I discovered early after its introduction in stores that I could no longer find it; I have a feeling it was just not merchandised effectively in the stores, being on the bottom shelf, not near the other gentle but high strength feminine anti-perspirants.It's a great value, it works, and it's gentle on skin. I highly recommend it."
4,"Keeps Odor At Bay, But Can Be Messy","First of all, it's not tested on animals which is a key factor (for me). Also, it's really good at keeping odor at bay. I've never used gel deodorants before, so I was surprised at how well it works. I do have to agree with the reviewer Cer, though, in that it leaves white streaks on my skin once it dries. Sometimes I have to pick it off. Also, I don't know if this is just the way of gel deodorants, but I have to dab at my armpits before I put a shirt on. Otherwise, the gel goes through my clothing and makes it look like I'm sweating. Overall, a good deodorant, but I'll probably switch back to a solid one after using this (for the annoyance factor of having to wipe my armpits with tissue before getting dressed)."
5,"Please reinstate this product, Almay!","I have used this deodorant for many years. I can't remember ever using a different one. When I was looking for a place to buy it, I saw several remarks from people like me who always have an itchy reaction to any other deodorant. I'm glad I could find it on Amazon."
5,Celtic music to dream by,"I have had this music in various formats for years. This is my favorite ""at home"" music. I listen to it every day sometimes & after several years I am still in love with this compelation."
3,Pain Free at your PC,"It is very specific, simple and has great points for the problem to solve.It is just okey if you already have the first book ""the Pain Free "" since it tens to repeat many of the exercises."
4,Pinched disks - rejoice!,"I have arthritis of the left hip joint. The mechanics of the wonderful human body sometimes move the discomfort from the joint to my lower back, exactly duplicating a pinched disk. Tried my Brother-in-law's Weslo after seeing the ads for the more expensive Teeter unit and was pleased the lower back pain receded.Ordered one out from Amazon, got confused by the assembly instructions but figured them out and have been using it daily when possible since. Gets rid of the morning back nerve pinch and sets me up for the day. Now if it could only do something about the arthritis."
4,Morning devotionals,We facilitate a 12-day educational program on the disease of addiction and we often use this book for morning devotionals. Twelve days of devotionals for the 12 steps of recovery.
3,plus size - top not great,"I bought these in a plus cuz my legs are a touch on the heavy size, despite the fact that I'm a medium (5'8"", 150 lbs, size 8 or 10 jeans) - they look good and seem to be strong material. THe plus size reached plenty high on my legs, and seem adjustable where they sit.However, the top pinches and isn't wide enough to stay in place. THe wide tops with silicone seem best for staying in place and not pinching and this has neither of htose qualities. THefore, I won't buy them again and am still looking for hte ""perfect"" thigh highs to wear."
2,disappointed,"Not anything like I thought it would be. Very vague on recipes and blending. You'd be much better off with ""Complete Aromatherapy Handbook"" or ""Magical Aromatherapy"". If it's magical you are looking for this book will not give you much to go on, little on uses, history or cautions. Layout is good, but that's about it."
3,"beautiful eye candy, nonexistant instruction...","while I give this book three stars, the price is so low in the used seller offerings I would suggest it to those who love fabric art if for no other reason than eye candy alone. The authors fun, bright childlike style is fantastic but this is no craft book as there are almost no instructions or projects. That being said-you can still glean alot from the photos and since it's dirt cheap I'd say it's a great book to keep on hand for inspiration.3 stars."
4,Excelente,Quien no se acerca a la música de Bahía se está perdiendo algo muy importante. Es la mezcla de ritmos afroamericanos mejor lograda hasta el momento.
5,I was there.,"I was a Dust Off Warrant Officer pilot with the 283rd Med. Det. ( Dust Off 69er) Pleiku, R.V.N.--1969/70--This book is very factual, not to heavy on numbers and exact dates. A real good read, good coverage.Brings to light the real good we helped do in Viet Nam. Highly recommend."
2,Cheated by the Publisher,"This was a story that needed to be told; unfortunately, it was not told well. As an earlier review pointed out, the most intense period of Dust Off action was esentially treated in a single chapter. When you add that fact to the virtual lack of ANY editing, you could easily come to the conclusion that this was a project on a very tight schedule. The text is filled with errors--basic grammar, punctuation, misspelling, etc.--making it difficult to read. The subject deserved better treatment. Readers who care anything about the English language should pass on this sad attempt at a book."
5,"Great tapes, excellent quality at a great price!","I purchased these for my mother, who uses a VHS recorder. She was well pleased with the service and is considering buying more. Excellent quality tapes with great color."
5,This the best CD I have ever listened too.,"Eagle Eye Cherry's song, Save Tonight is an excellent song a deserves all the credit that can be given to it."
2,Disappointing,"I love Bobby, and I love the Yellow Jackets.They just don't gel for me on this CD. There's no connection between them as we would hope. This leads to a very flat and unemotional recording."
5,Mission Impossible,"It doesn't get any better than this - a secret agency that uses brains instead of machine guns and martial arts to achieve its goals. The characters are well developed, and the right actors are there to bring those characters to life."
1,"Rerun of the 1968 ""Truth that Leads to Eternal Life""","Yet another retread of the ""Core JW Doctrines for Dummies"" concept, this is actually more or less readable. Suitable for, oh, Wally Cleaver after the Thorazine kicks in. Thin, dry, and unchallenging, but at least not extremely muddled."
3,"Unessential Hellfires, for diehards only","This is only worth getting for the completist Hellfires fan, but it is reasonably priced. Dr. Luv is different, like KISS but electro'd, Mr. 44 is a signature song, and I like the Incubus remix. Hellfires is one of the best bands right now. I only got this to complete my collection."
2,Candy History,"This is pretty flowery stuff. The kind of soft peddled history that either glosses over more controversial and negative aspects of the man, or completely ignores them. The author's other newer book, ""What Hath God Wrought"" portrays a very different Jackson. This one is more like something one would have been taught in an American history class in the 1960s- a sanitized version."
4,Animals with jobs,"If you like a play on words, animals that work in a human world and have a sense of humour you will love this career book by Will Bullas. His fanciful art, combined with his one liners should put a smile on your face."
5,Very entertaining reading,The Book was extremly well written. It was just like a real episode. The storyline with the high-ranking officers' club was cleaver and believable. I would recommened it to any mystery novel fan!!!!
5,Smithy G,Works great!!! with Foxconn K8M890M2MA-RS2H Motherboard max is 2GB with two blue color slots WOW!!! very fast with AMD-4 CPU 2800+ with Dual PNY 2x1GB DDR2 PC2 667MHz modules.First Check your motherboard model and PC manufacture first or go to [...] check it for you start downloading software check your memory tell you what memory to get or call support very helpful!!!
4,Verify the brand before you buy!,Works fine but was described as: PNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Desktop DIMM Memory Modules MD2048KD2-667 and what I got was another brand.
5,vast improvement,"I went from 2 gigs of ram to 4 gigs with this pair. It's a vast improvement over my previous 2 gigs. Computer boots up faster, programs start faster and even the games start up way faster than before. Very good easy and inexpensive improvement to your low to mid range system. Highly recommended."
5,Very Good DIMM,"I had no problem installing this DIMM. The PNY Optima immediately increased the speed and efficiency of my eMachines desktop. If you need affordability and great performance from your memory sticks go with this product. The Crucial brand also has comparable sticks as well. The PNY were slightly cheaper on Amazon. I haven't seen any noticeable performance differences between the PNY and the Crucial sticks as far as the 2gb(2X1gb) sticks go. When dealing with a lower amount of memory, paying the higher price for Kingston or Corsair isn't worth it. I will say this if you need more than 4 gigs then it might be. However PNY and Crucial have some excellent high end DIMMs too."
5,truth about polio vaccine,"If we really want to protect our families, we have to educate ourselves. This book provides information to open our eyes to the truth about vaccines and the process to produce them. Doctors are oblivious to what they are doing to their patients and how they are actually causing harm. Parents, it is time to wake up to the harm being caused by the contaminates and toxins in vaccines."
1,sigh...... just stupid.... 2 hours of my life gone,"Total waste. It may have been an okay story were it not for the incest and the gratuitous nudity and sex scenes. I guess if that's what you're looking for in a movie than this is the one for you...intend to either throw out or burn this particular movie, as I wouldn't want to pass that kinda trash on to anyone else.Shame, too -- Aidan Quinn is one of my favorite actors.I wish there were a lower rating than 1 Star."
3,"Good ghost story,but weakly delivered","I'm a huge fan of haunted house movies like THE HAUNTING(original),LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE,and ROSE RED and was curious about this one since I never hear about it.Um,as a romantic story with supernatural overtones it's pretty good but it has no creepiness one expects from haunted house stories."
2,Impossible to Receive,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift, in time for delivery. The vendor (who is now unknown) did not ship for several days, and the item never arrived. Whoever it was did not issue package tracking, so there was no way to check on the package. I waited in vain until the end of the month, when I gave up and went back to work, with the intention of following up with Amazon. I did not get to before they issued a surprise refund. They did so with the reason ""Customer Returned."" Hard to return an item that never arrives. And now, they have none. Not a great way to say ""I Love You"" at Christmas with an invisible gift......"
3,Cute by nothing memorable,"I am a big fan of Meg Cabot's adult books, and a couple of her YA. I read How to be Popular looking for some light, entertaining reading. It was alright, not bad, but not anything that kept making me want to read. It wasn't a total waste of time, but had I known what it would be like, I probably would have skipped it. After having read Geek High and especially Cindy Ella, this book paled in comparison."
1,Weird,Not worth money. Worth poop. Do no buy. Me no likey. Me say bad. Not know what say more. Do NOT buy this banana dipped in chocolate with lemon.
2,I'm SO Disappointed,"These shoes LOOK adorable. I was so excited when I received them, to see how pretty they are. But then I put them on . . . there was about a half inch of room in the heel even though they were my size, and there was absolutely NO traction on the bottom so when I tried to walk across the carpet, I couldn't move forward and when I did, the shoes fell off."
4,A Summation,"The Great Omission is a collation and summation of many past works by Willard. In that it brings them together in one concise book, this is quite helpful. In that no new ground is covered, readers of past books by Willard may be a tad disappointed."
4,"Good, not great","I only have two complaints about this player, 1, the headphones are terrible, but i use my own stereohead phones, that that is a minor problem for me. But the biggest problem, the one that has me wanting to trade this in, is that IT'S TOO QUIET!! I use STEREOHEADPHONES, put the volume on the HIGHEST LEVEL, and I can still hear sounds coming through. Apparently the MP3 is bad, but I use store bought cd's, so that has never been a problem. Other than that, all the features are great."
2,"Radio is a nice feature, especially if it's the ONLY feature","I just purchased this player from a retail outlet last week. I couldn't get MP3 CDs to work at all, it just keeps searching tracks. Then I found out that it doesn't even play audio CDs (brand new, no scratches). I'm walking around with a $... portable radio. Don't get me wrong, the sound is good, but based on other reviews, I'm taking it back and getting a different brand. I like the ID3 tagging feature and don't mind paying a little bit more for that feature."
4,It's great... but,"It's actually a great cd player, nice sound, easy to use, it has radio, long life battery, mp3 and all the basic functions you can find on a regular cd player, but the volume level is so low that you will need to buy some new headphones for sure, you can even hear the people around you when you're in the car or the bus, the headphones included has a nice design but are pretty cheap anyway.If you want a great sound, you should buy another model from Panasonic or buy a new potential headphones."
3,"Good product, but not enough volume","For the price, this is a good MP3/CD player. The AM/FM tuner is great and is hard to find in other models and the battery life is excellent. But clearly the max sound volume is extremely weak. I like to listen to music while mowing the lawn, but that's practically impossible with this unit. And another major drawback is the horrible ""random"" feature. I must've listened to the same song 4 times in one three hour car ride out of a possible 150 songs! Still, good bang for the buck.PROs:- AM/FM tuner- Good battery life- Decent sound quality- Sleek, lightweight design- Good priceCONs:- Very weak max volume- Inability to FF/REW in MP3 tracks- Random/Shuffle feature is horrible"
5,The Best CD Player on the market for the price,"I purchased this CD player several months ago and have had no complaints. It recieves the radio signal clear and strong. I shake it in my hand it won't skip a beat when playing a CD. I even dropped it on the floor several times and it still plays. The last time I dropped it on the floor the parts that keep it closed broke off. I have to keep it closed with tape. But guess what, it still plays like a dream."
5,Authentic Lithuanian Folk Music,This CD is hands down the best one out there for authentic Lithuanian folk music. The recording is very good...sound quality is high. The musicians play well. All in all it is a very good production.
2,A manufacturing mistake!,"Stangely it came wrapped as songs and dances from Lithuania but-- The cd inside,indeed printed as such, was in fact some type of accordeon French ""pot pourris"" selection from Paris! I kept it because it would have cost me much more to send it back to you than buy a new one. and where? And what about if the whole series is similar?! It's the first time that I experience such a problem with Amazon and I don't even hold you responsible for it. Too bad for me. But tell these folks just the same--The guy in charge of production that day must have had a good overdose of vodka!Armelle Glup."
4,very nice trash cans for office,I ordered these for our office lunch room. Excellent choice. sturdy and fit in a small spot. Packaging was a little bulky.
5,Ankle Bracelet,"Bought this item for my wife, she is very pleased. Attractive piece, and very sturdy construction even though dainty"
5,My Bling,"I am very impressed with the strength of this ankle bracelet. Thought I would loose it while swimming but it surprised me. Have received compliments on my ankle ""bling"" as I call it. It's fun to wear. First product I've purchased from this vendor but may have to look at more of the stock."
4,"Cute, but...","I've been wanting an anklet for a long time now. I decided on trying this one out first because of all the great reviews. As everyone else has said, this is a great product and is very dainty and pretty. Best thing is, it fits!..especially since I guessed on what size I should order. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 stars is because it was a lot thinner than the picture shows but it is priced accordingly so it's not that big of a deal. I've been wearing it for a week now and it hasn't broken despite it being so dainty so I am very happy with this product. I am super active and usually end up breaking dainty jewelry but it passed the test and I love how it looks! Buy it!"
5,Dainty and perfect,This is the cutest silver anklet I've ever owned. The 9 inch chain fits me perfectly and it also looks great. I am impressed!
1,Boring and bad.,Buy this movie if you have money to just throw away. The story is not the real one and it is a very weak production. My kids did not like it at all. I was disappointed.
2,Keyboard Review,This was a replacement keyboard. Best one I've found yet and will keep using it until I can't replace it anymore.
2,Very weird....,"The keyboard is canted upward in the rear, and the 6 key is on the same side as the 7 key vs. the 5 key. I couldn't use it."
2,"Ergonomic placement good, key feedback absolutely horrible.","First off, I did give this some time to adapt to (around 1 week) and it is not the positioning that I have an issue with, it is the tactile feedback of the keys. I am not expecting mechanical keyboard feedback, but these keys are some of the hardest keys to press down for a membrane keyboard. Pressing down the space bar especially makes your thumb tired quickly. This defeats half the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard if you have to strain constantly just to press down the keys. Also, the size of the keyboard is just monstrous. I'm not sure where you would be able to put your mouse without having to adjust your space or reach really far out with your arm, again defeating the purpose of the ergonomic factor. I am returning the keyboard as we speak. I would rather type on a better feedback experience (mechanical classic layout) than an ergonomic with the stiffest keys of any keyboard I have ever used."
2,Not very durable,"I've had two of these, and while I like the keyboard design, it is NOT designed for households with cats or kids who might spill something on them. The last one fried after only a few drops of water spilled onto it. I'd only had it 3 months. Durability wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't so expensive. I'll be looking for an under $20 keyboard I don't have to worry about."
3,"It's comfortable, but I don't get used to it. The space key is not good.","same as the titleThe space key is very hard to press.I like the design, but now my typing speed is super slow."
2,I had to send it back,"I was very excited to order this keyboard. I have used Ergo keyboards exclusively for over 10 years now but this one I just could not adjust to. It was hard for me to reach all the keys that required my pinkies (it actually hurt and gave me finger cramps!). Although the key layout didn't *look* all that different from what I was used to, it *felt* really different. I had a hard time doing any shortcuts with the CTRL key too. And the way the keys pushed felt weird, like I couldn't really feel if I had struck the key, I had to look at my screen to see what I'd typed."
1,Anti-ergonomic for me,"Microsoft Natural keyboards have been kicking around for a long time, and while they are reasonably inexpensive and decently constructed, I find them even less comfortable to use than flat keyboards. The only keyboard I have ever found to be a real improvement on standard ones is the oddly shapedKinesis Advantage USB - Keyboard - USB - black. I have used mine (an older version, of course) for over ten years, despite its worthless function keys, because it is the only keyboard I can find that lets me type as much as I want without causing my wrists to hurt. My hands are large with long fingers, but otherwise normal, so I don't know why my experience with ergonomic keyboards seems to be atypical."
5,Best keyboard I've ever used,I work in IT and spend my day typing. This is hands down the best keyboard I've ever used. No fatigue. No strain. Cool features.
1,Keys are hard to press,"I bought this from another vendor, and immediately had to send it back. The first 4000 keyboard I got, some of the keys didn't work at all. So we sent it back. Just got the second one today, and like all the other one star reviews said, the spacebar doesnt work, and they keys are hard to depressed. Wears me out as well. I'm headed somewhere I can try out the keyboards in person before I buy one. Dont buy this keyboard."
2,Sticky Keys,"I appreciate the keyboard design. With some practice, I am sure I would have gotten used to the keyboard layout (keep mis-typing). I can even get around the hight and bulkiness of it, even though it is too hig for the keyboard drawer on my desk. What I simply could not accept was how sticky the keys are. I even thought it was a defective keyboard. But then I went back and re-read the reviews and realized that I missed that about this keyboard, in the negative reviews. For someone with arthiritic wrists or some other musculoskeletal problem of the hands, sticky keyboards are simply not an option. It defeats the purpose of a an ergonomic keyboard."
3,Redesign the Space Bar,"I received this keyboard last week and am slowly getting used to it. One of the main issues that I've seen described in other reviews is the space bar. This is truly an issue. MS decided to have the main key plunger reside under the center of the large space bar. When the bar is hit away from the middle, the bar rocks and binds and results in missed spaces. If you have large hands, your thumb might hit the bar at the middle which will probably be more consistent. For me, my thumbs hit off to the sides a bit which results in binding and missed spaces (unless you really bang it). I'm training my thumb to be more toward the middle, but it is a definite pain. All of the other bells and whistles are cool, but what good are they if you can't type a space??"
1,Unusable,"My wrists hurt (I'm a programmer and spend at least 8 hours a day at the computer) so after reading a lot of positive reviews, I gave this keyboard a try. I returned it after 1 week for the following reasons:1. The spacebar is huge and clunky - it makes typing loud, slow and difficult and completely offsets any ergonomic benefits.2. The keys are mushy and feel cheap.3. The keyboard is very ugly and it takes up way too much desk space.The spacebar was the deal breaker for me. If Microsoft had split the spacebar or found a way to make it less clunky and horrible, I probably would have kept the keyboard."
1,Manufacturing problems,"This is by far the best keyboard I've ever had in terms of ergonomics, and the worst quality control I've ever seen in a high tech product. My first keyboard was from Fry's. F5, F7, and F9 failed but by the time I got around to returning, I was too late. Figuring it was a fluke, and knowing that Amazon is good about returns, I ordered one from Amazon. Same keys failed, in about a month. Amazon did a replacement. Same problem. I'm returning it today. I assume they will give me a refund. How could a problem like this possibly escape the attention of quality control? I'm shifting to the Logitech kayboard. I hope it fits me as well."
2,"After 16 months ""E"" ""S"" and ""D"" key labels worn off","At 16 months the E, S, and D key labels are all but worn off. I have Dell keyboards that after 10 years the labels on the keys are just fine. I've had no keyboard (using a Microsoft 3000 right now) where the key labels have ever worn off.Very disappointed."
3,Great keyboard...without lettering :-\,"As far as an ergonomic keyboard goes, it's a great keyboard. The programmable buttons are good and the soft palm rest is perfect for my hands. Why only 3 stars out of 5? The lettering on the keyboard started wearing out almost immediately. My M, V, and C are completely gone, the S, D, L, <, and > are half gone after a few months. No other keyboard I've owned has had the lettering wear out, even after a year or so of use. Take that issue away and it would have 5 stars, but the lettering disappearing is a serious issue."
5,Awesome product - awesome service,"I had an ergonomic keyboard at work and it finally died and my company only provides the standard keyboard. I ordered this keyboard and it arrived QUICKLY, it was AWESOMELY priced and the service was amazing!!My hands and wrist thank you!!"
1,"Beware, these are not NEW Keyboards","This is my second attempt at doing business with an Amazon Partner. Once again, I am unhappy. I bought two of these keyboards, they were described as new. They both came in scratched up boxes with broken or missing seals. Neither were packaged like new inside the boxes as well, internal packaging was ripped and the typical protective cover for USB connection was missing in both. Obviously these were returned or refurbished items. I have asked Amazon for a refund.I like the keyboard model, I'll just be getting it from somewhere else."
5,Love it,I have read a lot of review on here about this keyboard and space bar and I got to say I totally disagree with all those comments. This keyboard looks and feels great. I have no problems with the space bar stinking I am typing this review using this keyboard and I am intentionally clicking in the corners of the space bar and hitting it as soft as I can and not once has it stuck or not registered that I hit it. It does make some noise when you click it unlike the other key that are completely silent. But not load enough to be a bad thing.
3,Keyboard Review,"This keyboard is okay. I hate that Microsoft 'feels' like it has to take over the stinking world...as in...I put in the driver cd and it kicked out my Kensington Mouse software before it would install the keyboard software. This has happened with another MS keyboard I tried to use. Aside from the software irritation (and I got my mouse re-installed) the keyboard itself is, as mentioned before, okay. It isn't as severe as some of the other ergonomic keyboards...not as deep of a curve and fits pretty nicely with my hands. I'm a big fan of the 'extra' keys across the top, and got used to the media keys on my Kensington keyboard (FF/R). I wish Kensington made an ergo version of their keyboard. The extra keys didn't work on the first MS keyboard I purchased."
5,Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000,I really like this keyboard. It is very comfortable & functional. I would highly recommend it to anyone who uses a computer.
1,Unusable--spacebar too hard to push,To write this review I had to remove the keyboard and plug back in my old one. I tried to use this for a day and it was too painful--the spacebar is impossible to press. I've been working on computers for over 20 years and never have experienced anything like this. I'll be returning this ASAP. I gave this keyboard 1 star because I don't have the option of rating 0 stars
2,great except for the keys,"The shape of this keyboard is much easier on my wrist than my flat laptop keyboard.Also, unexpectedly, it sync'd right up with my MacBook Pro - I was prompted onscreen to answer a couple of questions (which keys are next to your Shift keys?), and that was it. No messing with driver downloads and installs or anything like that.So why just two stars? The feel of the keys is HORRIBLE! They are simultaneously sticky and mushy - especially the space bar - the worst keyboard I've used within memory. I find myself making mistakes constantly. I'll give the keys a day or two to loosen up, but my feeling is that this is going back, which is rare - I'm not a big returner.I had an older edition of this very keyboard years ago, at work - and it was great. As they added bells and whistles, Microsoft must have cheapened their manufacturing. Pity."
2,First impressions not great,"I'm on the computer 6-8 hours a day. After using this keyboard for a week, I find it more difficult to use and the keys much harder to reach. The wrist pad is comfortable but I swear it's like learning a whole new keyboard. It feels very strange. I have another ergo keyboard at home (a different popular brand) and love it- but this odd keyboard just seems strange. Maybe I will get used to it after a while."
2,Wow - that's a loud spacebar!,"The main keys are fairly quiet, but the spacebar ""clacks"" like a gun going off in comparison. After 5+ years (this keyboard was introduced in 2005) I would have thought Microsoft would have fixed this issue that has been mentioned in even it's earliest reviews - see ""Microsoft Natural Keyboard"" for yourself on wikipedia and read the ""any luck on the SPACE bar?"" discussion here on Amazon. Buyer Beware! Microsoft - fix your S*tuff!The keyboard does look sleek though -- the only reason for the 2 stars!The main keys are a bit quieter than my 10+ yr old ""Microsoft Natural Keyboard"" but overall that one is quieter compared to the constant ""clack"" (like there's ducks in my office) of the space bar. I still prefer my old PS/2 white (now yellow) keyboard w/o all of the ""hot keys"" which is working great still but just no pretty anymore. =("
2,The keys are very noisy.,"The keys are very noisy. I can not use the keyboard in very silent places because they think I'm hammering something. Also, I have to push very hard the keys and that causes me tired hands, especially the space bar key.I bought 2 and both have the same problem."
2,Sticky spacebar,"Overall the keyboard is great. The programmable keys are a nice feature. The layout does feel ""natural"". The palm rest is perfect and the installation was easy. So, why am I giving a rating of 2? The only thing wrong is the space bar key is really tough to press. All the other keys are soft and take little effort to strike. However, if you push the space bar from the edges instead of the middle, it takes an extreme amount of pressure to strike it. I am a developer and the keyboard is my most essential computer accessory. I am reminded every time I strike it that the keyboard is flawed. I am starting to think the space bar key should have been split the way it is shaped to keep it from sticking."
3,Very nice until it gets old and the letters wear off.,"Lasted 2 or more years and worked well and was comfortable. However, after the 1st year or after 1.5 years the letters started to wear off. After awhile I just didn't like not having the letters worn off and had to get a new key board. They used some cheesy model decal type sticker labeling for the keys which really wears off easily...maybe use some clear nail polish to make it last longer. It would get 4 maybe 5 stars if the lettering would stay on."
5,Great Keyboard,"So comfortable. I work on the computer all day and I was starting to get pains like carpal tunnel. The keys are in a very ergonomic outlay, but the biggest help was the riser that it comes with to force your wrists into correct posture. Haven't had issues since. Would definitely encourage this one even at twice the price."
3,"Very large, pretty comfortable","This keyboard is comfortable to use, but it's not perfect. First, it's large. If you use a keyboard drawer you should definitely measure before you buy. This fits mine, barely. Another problem is that the space bar is surprisingly difficult to hit right-handed and is quite loud. As i frequently take notes during phone calls I find this a problem."
4,"Dollar for dollar, best ergonomic keyboard around (just don't get the wireless version!)","I've used a variety of ergonomic keyboards over the years. I imagine some specialty manufacturers make a better product, but probably not this cheap. Works great with OS X (I use mine with my Mac setup in my home office). I tend to type pretty loud, so the quiet type feature is pretty much a must-have for me. Highly recommend the wired version. I have the wireless at work, and I've found the connection can be pretty unreliable."
2,"Noisy spacebar, hard to depress keys","I bought the MS Natural Ergo 4000 to replace a MS Natural Keyboard Elite. I thought the Ergo would be a step up but the extra features were not sufficient to overcome its drawbacks. I returned it to Amazon and have ordered another Elite.The spacebar on the Ergo is loose and clicks loudly each time I depress it. Depressing all other keys takes more pressure than I'm accustomed to using. The distance between keys and the size of some keys is different than the Elite. Perhaps, with time, I would have come to appreciate those differences, but the other issues were enough to preclude my taking that time."
2,GREAT Keyboard IF You Never Move It,"Great keyboard - EXCEPT the USB cable entering the back is VERY thin, and there is NO strain relief or even an attempt to make the entrance point curve gently. In addition, the cable enters the rear of the keyboard at its deepest point. The very thin cable, the sharp bend at the entry point, and the entry point being at the deepest point mean that if you ever take the keyboard anywhere, the USB cable is abused, and consequently, the internal wires of the USB cable break. Although I am very careful (I try not to bend the cable sharply), and although I have moved it only a few times (admittedly once in a suitcase, on an airplane) it has broken twice in a few years. This last time I cannot repair it, and I am looking for a different model.I have one of these at work also, and it has worked for years just sitting on my desk.So, it's a GREAT keyboard IF you never move it!"
2,Perfect except for one glaring problem,"As others have mentioned, this keyboard is excellent in all ways but one - the spacebar. The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for. However, the spacebar is massive (and not split in two as it should have been), with the actuator right in the middle. Unfortunately, when your hands are in the natural position your thumbs are at the far left and right of the spacebar. Not only do you have to push pretty hard to get it to go down, it also makes a REALLY LOUD clicking noise because you're actually forcing the actuator down at an angle. If they redesign this with a split spacebar I would LOVE it!"
2,Great...if it worked,"Doesn't work on my computer! I'm not running anything exotic at all - a Dell Inspiron laptop with XP. I spent a good two hours with Microsoft Tech Support trying to get it to work; they installed several drivers, got all up in my computer, and... it still doesn't work. I bought this from Amazon, but Microsoft is honoring its warranty and sending me another one. I'll update this review next week after that keyboard arrives if it changes anything.I should mention that the thing *seems* really comfortable..."
4,Good but not great,"Easy to install and use, a little bit noisy on the space bar. Price was great (sale) and standard delivery only took 36 hours!!!! Thanks UPS."
4,Great Comfortable Keyboard,"I had been using an old PC-Concepts Ergonomic keyboard (with no extra features) for the past 10 years and wanted something as comfortable.This was exactly the comfort level and feel I wanted. The padding is nice and the keys are very quiet.The keyboard and all special keys (with the exception of the center zoom) worked perfectly out of the box in both Windows 7 and Linux, which was very nice. I typically do not like installing extra drivers and programs for keyboard/mice.My only disappointment is the lack of media keys. There are only volume and play/pause, I wish it had a next/previous track button. I also own a ""Microsoft Digital Media Pro Keyboard"" which has these keys, as well as my ThinkPad, and I miss those functions. Luckily in Linux (Gnome) I was easily able to program the shortcut 1 and shortcut 2 to be the next and previous track (System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts).I highly recommend this keyboard for the ergonomic feel and comfort. The quality is great."
4,Fancy Keyboard,"takes getting used to, compared to the standard keyboard. The ergonomics are awesome. I love the Web/Home, Search, Mail and Favorite buttons along the top. Very useful. The gap between the keys could be smaller (where the Zoom key is), I have small hands and find it a little too far apart. The T,G,H and N keys are larger than usual so thats something else to get used to."
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU REGULARLY USE LOTION!!!,"This is a very decent keyboard in most respects. Keys are soft without being too spongy. The space bar issues often complained about on here has not been an issue for me. The problem is that the letters on each key rub away completely after just a few months. I notice this happens to those who regularly use lotion and/or eat greasy chicken at their desks. Most of the time, you don't need to see the key when touch typing but try it sometime without any visible letters. It sucks."
2,"Tough keys, spacebar is awful","I bought three of these keyboards [...]. I'm sorely regretting it. They keys are incredibly hard to press, and the spacebar is noisy and stiff."
2,Too many issues,"The first one I got had an issue with the backspace key. I would have to press very hard to register a backspace. I traded it in for a second one and now I have the same problem with the ""b"" key.I liked everything else about the keyboard so I thought I was going to trade it in again until just now when I attempted to play a video game and found that it won't register more than 3 simultaneous key presses which makes some games simply impossible to play.It's too bad because it's very comfortable and quiet, but I'm done with this keyboard."
4,The only keyboard I use,"I go through these about one every few months and I keep buying them after I've ruined, faded or burnt out the last one! I'm sure there are better ergo keyboards just waiting to be made, but in the meantime it's the only one I'll use."
1,Back in the box in an hour,"It may just be that finding the perfect keyboard is a very individual thing, but this keyboard was my second attempt in two weeks to find a good ergonomic fit for me...and this keyboard was even worse than the Logitech I tried.I am an average-sized woman at 5'5"", and have relatively long fingers, but the reach on this keyboard from the home keys to the Q/Tab or backspace/enter was absurdly and uncomfortably far. The spacebar as many have mentioned had to be pounded to get it to operate. And I found that the angle of the keys meant my elbows had to be kept at an uncomfortably wide angle, causing instant discomfort in my shoulder muscles.Also the keyboard is huge, and if you're not a big number pad user and you're right handed, it puts the mouse waaaaay too far to the right to be covenient or comfortable.I'm still searching for the right keyboard, but this certainly wasn't it.For me, a complete waste of time."
3,Inconsistent Microsoft technology/workmanship,"I've owned three of these, and all have at least 2 keys that don't work without having to bang hard on them. I suppose this is just par for the course for a product with the Microsoft name on it; who knows what flaws lie beneath the slick packaging? (Yes, I realize these are probably made by some sub-contracted manufacturer).Needless to say, I'm done with this model. Im in the market for another split keyboard, so I'm either going back to the Elite or will try the Logitech."
5,Great Keyboard from Amazon,This keyboard is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. Great Buy. I would recommend it to anyone who wants comfort over the larger footprint it takes up.
3,"Okay, I suppose.","Maybe it is because I stink at typing but I can't get use to this thing. Sure it is comfortable but I still can't type worth a darn on it and it has been over a month. The feel is nice, the durability seems decent so if you are a person who works well with these split designs then this puppy is for you. If you just thought you might want to try the split design out, I vote against it."
2,Needs work,"If you have hand issues, this keyboard does not have enough curve. I like the padded wrist rest but that's all I like. The previous model was better for arthritis and I cannot find a keyboard that really works like the older models. Seems as though they are trying to outdo everybody else and end up with some modern looking piece of junk that really doesn't do much for aching hands. Sometimes ""cool"" is not so cool."
2,Sticky Spacebar,"I would recommend avoiding this keyboard for one specific reason: the ""sticky"" spacebar. Unless you are applying pressure to the very center of the bar (rather than favoring the right or the left sides), an unusual amount of force needs to be applied just to operate it.This is extremely bothersome because it slows you down while typing as well as making it more fatiguing. It is also quite loud...I've actually had people in other rooms complain about the racket!NOTE: the sticky bar issue with this keyboard is an extremely common one (if not universal). I wish I had done some research on this item before purchasing it and saved myself the trouble of a return."
1,"Yes, the spacebar is (still) terrible.","As has been stated, the spacebar is harder to push than other keys and significantly louder. I purchased it despite seeing these complaints because someone commented that he thought it had been fixed. It has not as of 12/8/2011. It's quite disappointing to see Microsoft not bothering to fix this one glaring issue on one of the most used keys. It was probably worth a shot to try a cheap alternative to the ~$100 goldtouch/kinesis keyboards I had been buying but in my case it didn't end well >.>"
2,Good idea - not practical,"I too am a writer. I thought after a few months that I would become accustomed to the keyboard. I haven't. It is a neat idea, but after 40 years of using the standard QWERTY keyboard I have not been able to make the transition to this style. In typing this I made 8 mistakes. It is too easy to hit multiple keys, and the force needed to press the space bar and some of the keys is unnatural. I would not recommend this keyboard. But then, Microsoft is not known for their hardware."
3,I wish I had it but amazon screwed up,"Pros: I wouldnt really know. Looks nice and the info based on what I read about it made me buy it.Cons: Amazon.com screwed up and mailed it to the WRONG location. There was also a razer mouse that was sent to the wrong address and the CS rep had informed me on the phone and also via email that he would have the mouse sent to my correct address. Instead, he send this package TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. FUBAR Amazon...."
3,Works OK,I've been using 2 of 4 of these keyboards for about 3 years and my only complaint is 2 of them have one key each that doesn't work after about 6 months. I like the design but alot of other people do not.
2,Keys Rub Off Very Quickly After Normal Use,"I like this keyboard and I owned a MS Natural (the white ergo ones) before it...but the keys get rubbed off during normal use after only a few months. Of the alphabet keys, only my Q and N keys aren't rubbed off. Then N remains because the N key is extra wide for the ergo design and I'm touching it where the letter does not appear and the Q is still present because...apparently, I don't use the letter Q very much. However, if I make this review any longer...it'll probably rub off so I'm going to stop riiiiight...now."
2,"Uneven quality, sticky spacebar and other keys","I have bought or used at least three keyboards of this model. They all have different feel/characteristics, as if all made by different manufacturers. The first one was great: quick, quiet and very smooth. The second one was terrible, several keys are really sticky--they don't bounce back right away, and the Space bar is the worst of them all. Sometimes, I had to press it a couple of times not knowing which hit will show up. Then I had to Backspace out the extras. It was living hell. Then the last one is OK. Not quite as good as the first one but not as sticky as the second. I only used it for a couple of weeks now, so can't say for sure.It is still the only ergo keyboard that works with Mac (with build-in volume and play buttons) so I have little choice. However, if you do, keep my warnings in mind."
4,A great keyboard but the flaps on the back break off easily,We have purchased three of these to day ~ we just love the keyboard! The only thing which we would like to see changed is the little plastic pieces on the back which lift the keyboard up at an angle. You have to be really careful with them because they break off easily. The keyboard still works well ~ it just takes away the option to have your keyboard at an angle. It works just fine laying completely flat on the desk though. Even with that little issue ... we would still purchase another one.
2,one of the keys doesn't work!!,"I can't type the key that doesn't work, because it doesn't work!!!!!! (hint), the one located between the Z and the C. Ironically, it worked fine for the first month, but now that I can't return it, it no longer functions. I have never had a problem with items purchased from Amazon, but this is definitely no good. I do have to say that all other concepts of the keyboard are great, but this defect erases all of the good points. I have several microsoft devices for 3 different pc's, all of them are fine, but totally dissatisfied with this one!!!!"
4,Spacebar could use some work,"All around a very good keyboard but the fact that the spacebar is so hard to press down compared to previous versions makes me think others are right. The spacebar really needs to be fixed. Splitting it into two would probably be the best route. I do hope the play on the key eases up with some use, or I can see getting some cramps in my thumbs."
1,FOGETTABOUTIT...,Goofed my typing all up. I have not been right since going back to a standard keyboard. Useless garbage.
5,great keyboard,"I am enjoying my keyboard. It will take me a bit to learn all of the functions but I will get them down. I highly recommend this keyboard. I like the one button functions of the calculator, web/ home and my very favorite is the favorites buttons ( just wish there were more than 5)."
4,Overall a great keyboard,I have had this keyboard for over 2 years and it has worked great for me. I love the ergonomic design and the padded wrist rest. The only complaint I have about it is the space bar which makes a lot of noise when you hit it and takes more pressure than other keys due to the design. If they ever decide to improve it they could split it into two buttons and that would easily fix the problem.
1,Enter button stopped working after 3 months,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. I type very softly but the ""enter"" button stopped working after only three months. Several other customers have had problems with other buttons stop working after as little as a week or two (see the Amazon discussion forum on this product). Also the space button is really hard to press. The return policy is very unclear and Microsoft charges you 35 $ only to ask one of their agents a question (keybord costing 39$!). Better buy a different keyboard."
1,Spongey keys but nice features,"I'm giving this keyboard one star because ultimately a keyboard primarily needs to have keys that are comfortable for me to use and don't impede my input. I found the keys on this keyboard to be way too ""spongey"", meaning that the keys press down quite a ways then don't spring right back up... It was akin to walking through quicksand, if that makes sense... I found myself having to press the keys harder, and that would then slow down the next key press. Strongly suggest you try this one out in the store!"
5,Best so far,"Two things Microsoft OEM's well... keyboard and mice. This keyboard is awesome- Apple could learn from this design, choice of materials, and functionality."
3,Steep learning curve,"I loved the first natural keyboards and was excited to get the MS4000 keyboard and even pre-ordered it. As any new keyboard there's a learning curve and it takes a little time to get used to and find the keys, however I still today constantly miss keys and though I really like some of the other functions am contemplating going back to the ugly cream coloured ergo board. I guess it just goes to show that ""new and improved"" isn't always improved."
3,A little dissapointing for microsoft product.,"I bought this keyboard because I suffer from mild Carpal Tunnel (pain in your hands and wrists). This keyboard really helps if you suffer from that condition. I didn't think a keyboard could make such a difference with that condition. The TWO things that I'm NOT HAPPY about are: 1. The white lettering on the keys has come off and now most of the keys are just blank (luckily I know where keys are without looking down). 2. The keyboard is noisy, the keys are not as soft or quiet. The Space bar is definitely very noisy. IF this keyboard was super cheap, I wouldn't complain about these two issues. Several of my coworkers also went and got this keyboard and we all agree, that for the price, the quality should be better then this. There's some cheaper keyboards out there that might not be ergonomic, but are made w/ better materials. OVERALL: I would NOT buy this keyboard again."
4,MS Ergo keyboard,"Bad design/construction of space bar. The space bar continually sticks. No way to get at the underside of it to see if it can be manually adjusted. Keyboard is great design...better than the previous model. However, keys make a lot of noise--including spring noises."
5,Best answer for Carpal Tunnel suffers ... short of surgery,"This has got to be one of the most comfortable keyboards around, after two days use, my wrists stopped hurting from the strain of keyboarding all day long."
1,Very Disappointed!,I have been using this style of Microsoft keyboard for many years. Suddenly they no longer make it in a wireless format. Now I can no longer move my keyboard back while conferencing with students since I am now tethered by a cord. The quality of the product has gone down too. The keys are now much louder and the letters have come off of half of the keys after only two weeks! My last keyboard lasted me about five years and all of the keys are still readable. Good thing I don't need to know what letter each key is!I really wish someone else made a good ergonomic keyboard. I am very dissatisfied with this one!
1,Frustrating for Toddlers,"My 2 1/2 year old son fell in love with this at the store. But after we got it home he just cried and cried with frustration. It is a great concept but doesn't work very well. I smashed my finger numerous times trying to pop the ramp inside the trailer down. My son was frustrated for several reason:1. The cab doesn't stay on the trailer.2. The cars are hard to get in and out of the ramp.3. The trailer doesn't turn it is only straight ahead.I returned it the same day we purchased it after he was so frustrated. The point is for your child to enjoy their toys, right?"
2,fun but annoying design poorly made,"I bought this for my son and he loves playing with it and laoding the cars with it but after ONE day I am ready to toss it and look for other options. The rubber wheels come off Constantly. The launcher(which is the trailer) does not have a have latch to hold it down so if you carry it by the trailer as shown in the pamphlet, it pops up, if you are playing with it, it pops up,etc. When it pops up in locks in place so you then have to push a lever on the bottom of the trailer to get it to go down. Turn the trailer back over after pushing the lever on the bottom and it pops up into launch mode. Also the lever that allows the top level of cars to load is always coming down onto the bottom level of cars. Also the trailer doesnt stay attached well to the semi during play forcing you to keep hooking them back together. This would be a great toy if it worked and wasn't so poorly made instead its frustrating for both parent and child!"
4,Hauntingly Beautiful...,"I had to lower the rating on this book, not because it wasn't a good story (it's a very beautiful, poignant one) or because of the style of the writing (the book is written in free verse). I did it because, after buying a hardcover book, it took me fifteen minutes to read it.Cassie Devlin lived a pretty good life--a loving mother, friends at school, a wonderful boyfriend named Kyle, outstanding ability to write music and play the piano, and a group of like-wise minded musical players at school called Composer's Workshop. Everything was wonderful, until Gail Sherman entered and world and, ultimately, ended her life.DEAD ON TOWN LINE is a hauntingly beautiful story, tellling the story of Cassie's death and how she realizes that being dead doesn't mean you're finished with things here on Earth. She meets another young girl like herself there in the in-between, and together they work to right the wrongs that have been done to them."
4,An excellent and objective read,"This is an excellent and unique work. It will not bore you in the least bit. Grossman presents a very human and objective picture of life in the first German socialist state. This is a very informative and interesting account and should be read not only by those interested in the GDR, but also by those interested in history in general, and those who enjoy a fascinating story. This work paints a very different picture of the GDR than the usual Western ""totalitarian nightmare"" type books. Highly reccomended."
3,Osama Ben's rockin,"Just as our copies of Sha Sha have thrown up their funnel cakes after their numerous spins in our cd players, Ben releases his latest. Ben walks us through another album of catchy, sing at the top of your lungs tracks. The recording and production definitly stand out, as well as more mature song writing from our boy. On My Way is definitly a step in the right direction, and has kept the accessablity that made the first album so enjoyable. ""hear me out, you dont know im here"" ben pleads. Oh, but we do.essential tracks - Hospital Bed, Down, Living Life"
5,A miracle indeed.,From childhood I loved C. W. Anderson's horse illustrations - Billy and Blaze was one of the first horse books I read and loved. I thought of him as mainly an illustrator of children's horse books - imagine my surprise when I found this book. It is a wonderful interpretation of Greek Statuary. Anderson follows Greek art from some of the earliest examples through the classical forms into later Greek art. His comments on his drawings from an artist's perspective are interesting - I have looked at them from an archaeologist's perspective primarily. I will definitely use some of these pictures in class to show my students how Greek statuary developed over time. An excellent book.
5,Scary,This was the scariest goose bumps book I have ever read. Now all my friends want to borrow my kindle to read this book.
2,OK - But there are better,Hace had this for a couple of years now. It is ok and does its job. Often goes to the setup screen which is apain to get out of when you want to watch a DVD. Buy if cheap enough but look around as this unit is nothing special.
3,Pretty good but not great...,I thought the gloves were a cool concept. I wore them all of about 30 minuets at work and the rubber just started wearing all the way off... I Like the protection and the fact you can use your fingers and feel while working but the rubber part is not that great... By the way I still have the gloves I wear them under a bigger pair of rubber palms that are not cut resistant.
3,Not the greatest gloves,"Using these gloves for daily use with scissors. After 1 week, the material started deteriorating. Not a huge expense but I wish the gloves lasted longer."
2,Hmm.,"Sad thing about this CD is; the artwork's better than the music. It is. This could still mean that the music is great; if the artwork's pure art the music could still be at least 4-stars. But no. No. No. I picked up this CD today for $1, because I'd always wanted it and well, here was my chance. I gave this a spin, and the one word that popped up in my head was 'mediocrity'. This record is pure mediocrity. Big Ballers? Yes, just another No Limit clone coming to haunt us. Avoid."
5,Big Ballers Records gots tight rhymes,"this cd is dizzope tight. Mint Squad and Po Boy and Family Ties set it off with tracks like this is how it's going down, paper chase, and ain't no stopping the south. my favorite song is this is how it's going down by the mint squad, it's got a good hook with a tight beat so if you have a little change get this cd Big Ballers!"
1,not good quality,"This item broke the very first time I used it. When I pushed the spigot back to release the drink the handle broke off, and you could see it was attached by a very cheap, weak piece of plastic."
1,Pure Junk!,"The ""brushed chrome"" is plastic. The spout leaks, and the motor burned out in one week. On top of that the store where I purchased it, Kitchen Kapers wouldn't let me return it saying it wasn't designed for drinks that require crushing ice. Why then do some of the recipes in the manual call for ice cubes?"
1,Misleading advertising,"We were disappointed in this blender and returned it. The blender is not, as the description says, ""brushed chrome"" - it's plastic. The ""stainless"" accents are plastic, as well. The only chrome or stainless is on the faceplate, where the embossed logo appears. So, the construction is quite flimsy, especially for a high use item from a well-known brand.In addition, the motor seemed to strain on the lowest setting, and gave off an unpleasant odor. Finally, the shape and size are cumbersome and not easy to clean or store in the fridge.Overall, we were surprised at the low quality from a well-known brand, and returned it immediately."
2,Poor quality - drips and not well constructed,"I have been pretty disappointed - the ""spout"" is really nothing much more than a gimmick - the idea is good, but the quality is poor so this drips even after turning ""off"" the spout.... Cleaning is very difficult as some of the pieces don't come apart.... Surely there have to be better quality units at the same price point."
1,"Racist, Sexist, Dismissive of Anything but Biology","Feldman's ""well-researched"" book is a classic human development book, written from a rich white man's view. He does very little to express race and gender as anything but biology. These two things are sociological constructs in addition to being somewhat biologically based. In my world, half-truths are still lies. This book has a lot of pictures of people from different cultures, with different phenotypes, et cetera. It does not walk the walk or talk the talk of a socially responsible take on human development and psychology. For instance he uses Freud to speak of gender roles- a man who named an entire stage of human development after the penis. Just a poor read overall. It felt like going back to high school biology class. Not much more than a survey book."
3,I'll buy the DVD just for the bar scenes.,"The singer in the bar scenes (mentioned by a previous reviewer) is Steve Pryor, the ""best guitarist you'll never hear"". He is from Tulsa, Oklahoma and has an impressive list of accomplishments including his own CD's. Apparently there's no soundtrack CD from this movie available. Too bad. Also, there are several good shots of the keyboard player, David Busey."
4,Delicious Treat!,"This is a Saturday night movie if I've ever seen one.A Screwball comedy.All the actors seem to be having a ball starring in it.Penelope Ann Miller is cute, sexy and dynamic as Betty Lou.Her transformation from frumpy plain and timid to cute, hot and dynamic is worth the price of the movie.Other than Other People's Money, maybe her most fun and entertaining role.Lucille Ball would have been the star if it was made in the 1930's.Alfre Woodward and Julianne Moore show a surprisingly tremendous comic talent.Quite a change from their usual serious and troubled characters.This movie is fresh, fun and frenetic.William Forsythe is still menacing, but with just the right comic touch this movie needs.He would have been even better than Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"".I saw this movie on cable at least twice.Jumped at the chance to make it a permanent part of my DVD collection."
2,BETTY LOU'S A BIG FAT LIAR!,"Shy Betty Lou (Penelope Ann Miller) who rightly thinks of herself as a dull, small town librarian, injects a little excitement into boring life by confessing to a murder her cop husband is investigating in Allan Moyle's comedy, romance, thriller.It all starts when Betty Lou finds a discarded gun, a weapon used in a recent murder, in a park. She dutifully takes it to the police, but she's ignored until she fires it and confesses to the crime. Taken to jail, the mousy librarian is transformed into a bombshell by some of her fellow inmates.Sandra Bullock might consider a remake of this oddball film because it's not the crime that really matters here, it's the change Betty Lou experiences as she takes control of her life. Of course, the loose ends of the story are tied up and Betty Lou even saves her marriage. And it's all triggered (pun intended) by a gun."
1,Do your research,"We tested this intercom in our home & at our church: had loud squeals, humms, and too much static to make out the person on the other end of the line regardless of frequency, channel, position, or location. After further research we learned that this is typical of wireless intercoms - will try a hard wired version next."
5,Tastes great,Good for cooking. Bourbon and brown sugar baked soy beans were terrific. Use on low carb cinnamon buns with splenda for a real treat. I like it on my low cereal.
2,"Works, but the build is cheap and fragile","The unit does its job and works well for both PC and Mac. However, the build is cheap that it requires delicate handle. Compact Flash insert is rather painful, and I found that I could easily bend the pins. In fact, a little jiggle last time attempting to get the CF slot to work has eventually twist the pins enough to make it stop working."
2,An old classic story,"The English Roses, Madonna's first book tells about friendship between young girls. Four young girls called The English Roses are best friends. Yet they feel jealous with Binah because people always adore her. One night, they dream of a fairy who asks them to take a look closely to Binah's poor daily life. They begin to change their mind about her and make friends with her.The story about such friendship is so classic but yet the colorful illustration is enjoyable."
5,Magistical!,"So maybe I am a big fan of Madonna in general. Given this, the book is truly inspiring, even for a 21 year old working in the financial services industry. My boss spent five minutes reading it and ended up tearing up, it was a fascinating sight."
1,"What, I can't rate it zero stars?","This book was incredibly superficial. I read that Madonna based the character off of her own daughter. Oh, I feel so sorry for the poor little pop princess' (perfect) underpriviledged daughter. Give me a break! The story was cheesy, predictable, and lacking any depth. ..."
5,Absoluetly Beautiful,"This story is very touching. It especially provides valuable lessons for children. It shows them why you shouldn't judge a person until you know them, and how making a new friend can get you further in life than jealousy or envy. Madonna did a wonderful job. I definitely recommend this book for people of all ages."
1,Makes dads look bad,"I think this books puts dads in a bad light. It makes the dad look like some evil parent. We need more children books that portray dad's and mom's in a positive light.In addition, I am not sure it is good to expose girls to the pettiness of gossip unless it actually happens. If you child is damaged by some real life gossip then you can introduce some visual or story aide to help them resolve it. Not before. If you do, this books needs heavy afterward coaching to put this book in the proper framework."
1,not worth the money,"I liked the illustrations but the story line is poor, cheesy and lacks substance...but then again let's consider who wrote it...Madonna...that should explain why. Just because she is a celebrity, the book is getting much attention. Take it from an experienced children's writer, don't bother wasting your money on this book. If you are curious about the story line, wait until it is available at your local library....then just browse and then put it right back on the shelf where it belongs, to collect dust."
2,She tried...she really tried,"I really like the pictures in this book. I think they appeal to the modern tweens with their cool girl images and swanky colors. However, the story is very weak. Madonna takes a lesson (don't judge someone before you know them) and she tries to make a story out of it. I think it started well, but she tries to by funny and that doesn't work. She is no Lemony Snicket, my friends. Also...the fairy godmother thing? Come on...that was just...ridiculous. All in all, the story is just too cheesy for me. The last page could've been great! But it lost its magic with the line ""I didn't make this up."" Couldn't she have been a bit more mysterious than that? Good try Madonna...I'm still waiting for your acting career to get better too... :)"
2,The illustrations carry this book,"One can't help but wonder how well this children's book would be received if not for its famous author. Its biggest pitfalls are twofold. (1) it lacks a clear audience; it proves to be cumbersome and tripping as a ""read aloud"" book for the pre-reader, but is not engaging for a self-reader. (2) the dialogue, in particular, is poor; its overdone attempts at feeling familial and directly addressing the reader are stiff and out-of-place.The redeeming value of this book is the lovely illustrations. The English Roses are unique and beautifully created. The illustrations fully deserve the extra packaging as a way to market the visual appeal."
1,Average,"Average Read. Nothing really good to differentiate it from the better ones out there. Get it if you're curious about all the hype, ignore it if you're looking for a good read."
4,The English Roses: A Fine Start,"As a teacher of English Literature, published writer of fictional short stories and poetry, I appreciate and applaud Madonna's first foray into children's literature. Madonna captures the reader by using colorful illustrations and relateable characters. Madonna expresses genuine emotion and I am sure that young readers will come out of this reading experience having learned a very positive life lesson."
5,Madonna: Greatest Entertainer of All-Time,"She's in the league of the Beatles and Elvis in terms of record sales and industry influence. Last time she made a book (SEX), it failed miserably (it made some money, but nearly ruined her career). I, for one, wasn't looking forward to her ""children's books."" However, once I saw The English Roses, I changed my mind. Her avid adult fans may find this book cheesy and boring, but kids will love this. The English Roses successfully gives a good message and is beautifully illustrated. And this time, Madonna tops a different chart: The New York Times Best Seller List."
2,pleaze ....we expect more,"this book is fundamentally rite on...but it lacks.........Its too obvious. Of course the pretty girl is thought to have it all, so she is left out, in the end they (the engish roses) realize shes just like them, and decide to include her. I just don't think it teaches our children, and the humor isn't appropriatefor kids. Madonnas writing style means well, but becomes irritating."
2,IT WAS ALRIGHT,THIS BOOK WAS OKAY FOR A FIRST STORY FOR MADONNA. I'VE READ BETTER ONES TO MY YOUNG ONES. I THINK THE STORY COULD OF BEEN BETTER BUT MY KIDS LOVE IT.
