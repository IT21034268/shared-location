1,world war z,"if i am not liking a book i will give it 100 pages before i move on. i could only get to page 57 in this book after three days of trying...the storylines were dull, there was no empathy with the characters. since i am in the minority here i guess it is a pepsi/coke situation"
4,Great entertaining story,"The writing and story are very engrossing and fun to read. I would have liked some more explanations at some parts, but overall this is a good book."
5,The ultimate zombie war review,"This book makes you see how the war against the living dead was seen on several fronts. Highly recommended, a must have."
3,An O.K. collection of short stories.,"This is basically a collection of short stories. It is an imaginative narrative of a zombie war, but the stories are almost never scary or creepy.I didn't hate it, but I can't say I recommend it."
3,Review of WWZ,"Good, slow in the middle. Interesting way to wrap up the book, i wish the narrator's story was told. ."
5,Great book for zombie lovers,"Great book, was not a continuous story, but rather a collection of smaller stories that take place during the zombie outbrreak. Couldnt put it down."
2,Unrealized Potential. Lack of Plot and Writing Style Brings Down Book,"This book is not terrible and seems to have a lot of potential. However, I lost interest a little more than half way through because of the writing style and lack of plot to bring all the short stories (interviews) together. I didn't mind the short stories initially, but it just wasn't able to keep my attention for an entire book."
4,Very interesting,"A real unique take on a possible ""future"" event. Some of the testimonials were so interesting I wanted them to continue."
5,I've read it twice... still the best Zombie book,"I'm just some guy who likes to read and not some grammarian-type. I found the story easy to follow and consistent. Dont be fooled by the news/interview-like descriptions made in the book. When you tie it all together, it really makes the ""story"" very deep and enjoyable. As stated in the title, I've read it twice, and will read it again in a few months. I compare all of the zombie stories I read to this book."
3,This popular writing style isn't for me,"I do love my zombies - ""true"" and pseudo. However, despite the fact that I really wanted to like this book, I found it lacking. Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps it was the distracting writing style - government report after government report. I know this style is currently popular and many people enjoy it, but it's not for me. I guess I'll see the movie when it comes out, but seriously? Brad Pitt?! Who casts these things?"
5,Great Read!,This is a wonderful book and I really enjoyed the writing style. I am a real fan of zombie novels and this is by far one of the best out there. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a good book.
4,For Zombie Fans Only,"If you're in the mood for a good zombie book that pretty much hands you everything upfront, then this is the book for you. The book consists of interviews, which really end up being short stories, so you never get bored. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that the voices of these seemingly very different characters sound very similar. The occasional stereotype is thrown in, in an attempt to differentiate between characters, but it's done so bluntly that it's excruciatingly obvious. I gave it four stars, because anything having to do with the actual zombies was awesome and the book itself was very entertaining. It even gave me nightmares, which is always a plus when reading zombie fiction!"
4,So far so good. Just started reading it.,"It's hard for me to find a book that keeps me reading past the first chapter, but this one grabbed me from the first few pages.It just jumps right into the beginning of it all.My only issue is that the seller plastered 4 or 5 stickers all over the cover and back in random spots. I can understand one sticker somewhere, but all of them were randomly placed and all say the same thing ""MANDO BOOKS"", all in bright florescent colors. I was able to get two of the stickers off, but they left behind that extra stuff that stickers tend to leave and now the cover is ruined. The other three stickers I started to get off, but I can tell that they will tear the cover up even worse, so I had to leave the eye soars on there.Overall, I would recommend this book if you like zombies, but DO NOT buy from this seller if you don't like stickers all over."
2,Ruined by Politics,"I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was. This was very cool at first. But my suspension of disbelief was shattered by the author's riduculous, unncessary political agenda. You find out in part 2 that, like everything else in the world, the zombies are Bush's fault.To be more specific, the reason the United States wasn't able to handle the zombie outbreak is because the population was so ""war weary"" and felt so betrayed that they weren't willing to do what was necessary to fight off the undead.In other words even though flesh-eating monsters were wandering the streets, when the government asked for volunteers people said, ""No, sorry, I'm still too upset about Iraq.""This could have been a great story. But the author chose to deliberately cut his potential audience in half by trying to force his politics on us. Very sad."
2,Are these people kidding?,"I bought this book based on all of the strong reviews. I am not a snob by any means: I love popular books (Game of Thrones) and movies, and love most sci-fi. I found this to be very, very basic entertainment. This is a collection of disparate stories about the zombie-apocalypose. A few of them are entertaining but I found the majority of them to be repetitive and not really that interesting.This is a beach book at the very best. Caveat: I am only 70% finished."
1,Extremely dull read,"While I appreciate the originality of the effort, it makes for a very tedious dull read. I can see this working better as a TV show and even then it is a stretch."
3,"Great Book, Where is the rest?",I read the book and I was interested to see what voices they would use. It was good but not great and they left out about three chapters that I thought were the best chapters. Big let down. Get the book you'll thank me later!
2,DId not like this book,"I only got half way through this book so I don't know how it ended. I would have preferred a ""story"" as to a Q&A History. What I did read was more on the political side of a zombie war than the zombies themselves. I'm a zombie lover but this was just not my style of book!"
4,Surprised I liked it,I never read books like this but saw a trailer on tv for the movie and wondered what it was about. Well it's a zombie movie but much more. I was enthralled to the end.
4,Great book,"I was expecting more of a first person novel, but this has a good flow to it. Shows you a much broader picture."
5,great,"this book is so well researched tha it could be reality. Loved it. Anticapting the movie. GO ZOMBIES, BRAINS GRAAAh"
3,It was just OK,"I'm a HUGE zombie fan. Zombies rule. This book chronicles a zombie war from the perspective of survivors from all over the world telling their stories by being interviewed by the ""author"". And I found it to be just OK. Some of the interviews are a little dry. I found myself wanting to skip some of the interviews to see what the next one was going to be about. However, some of the stories were fantastic. I really liked the way it had perspectives from all over the world. It also chronicled the start and ending of the war. I like more suspense and scariness in my zombie tales. Some stories had just that, but most did not. And each interviewee seemed talk like all the others. The author needed to change up the dialogue to cater to each person. A person from Japan is not going to talk the way a person from South Africa speaks, even with translation. It just fell a little flat for me. I am interested to see how the movie version will be."
5,Brilliant!!!,was not sure about the style of the book however it has hooked me and I found it to be amazing.
1,Hugely Disappointing,"I had been flirting with the idea of purchasing this book for at least a year, mostly because I had heard that it was written in the form of interviews, and read more like a chapter book. I finally broke down and bought it....so sad. I love my Zombie books, they are usually so action packed, scary, and just plain fun. This book was everything I hoped it wouldn't be; dull, slow moving, and just kind of irritating. I kept waiting for it to ""pick up"" and it never did. I hope the movie is better. I wouldn't recommend it, especially for the price, there are a TON of more entertaining books in the 2.99 to 4.99 price range."
3,"Not bad, not great.","My friend loves this book, I found the way the narrative changes so often kept the book from building much momentum."
4,good read,"Worth reading if you like zombies, although the seperate narrative can get annoying. But as a whole from the start of the out break to the mop up and rebuilding its every thing you want in a book of this genre, lets hope they dont screw it up with a movie."
2,A tad bit boring,"I bought this knowing the layout of "" interviews"" with the survivors, but jeez after 200 pages of repetitive stories it gets a bit much, they are basically short stories ,some good - most of which unfortunately aren't, Then you realize there are still 100 plus pages left! This book just wasn't as entertaining as I hoped and with no real main character you don't really get involved with the story. Each interview is roughly 4 pages each and by the time you develop a feel for the character it's over. It's a bit over hyped I think and honestly I have been forcing myself to try and finish it for the last 3 weeks but I just can't do it. I'm stuck on page 220 and I'm afraid I won't be able to make myself read the rest. I wanted to love this book but in all honesty i just don't find it entertaining. Guess i Need more story than interviews or maybe Brooks writing style isn't as good as everyone is saying."
3,Not the thriller you would think a book about zombies would be.,"I borrowed this book from a friend. I was excited about it after seeing a trailer about the movie. I was pretty disappointed. It is a series of interviews that tell you a piece at a time what the war was like all over the world. There was virtually no suspense. However, I kept reading it to see how it would end. I'm hoping the movie is much better and not portrayed as the dry series of interviews portrayed in the book."
4,Not too bad,"I am not a zombie fan by any means. This book was actually pretty good, many of the earlier reviews didn't like the style of the writing and the charactors but they all except for the ninja guy where pretty good.It is a interesting story that is simply told from a different view which is a nice change from the normal writing stylesI would recommend this one to anyone"
5,Hard to put down!!!,This is a brilliant book. I defenatly beleave that Zombies are the new Vampires! I have a hard time getting into books because they feel like there never going to end. But this book is different. The short stories are brilliant when one person is done explaining what happened to them your so amped up to see what the next person will say! This is a great book I have 3 people that want to borrow it from me. This is the first book i have read from from Max Brooks cant wait to read another one.
5,Studs Terkel On Zombies,"I'm not going to repeat what so many others have said about the book (let alone repeat the plot), I'll just say that the author creates an incredibly authentic tale, and a cast of real people that describe what could be any great epidemic or catastrophic event such as a major war. If it wasn't for the fact that no zombies exist, you'd think he was a historian, not a fiction writer. Can't compliment him enough on this achievement, and can't recommend enough what has been a real page-turner for me."
5,Deserves a Spot on Your Top 5 List,"World War Z is a work of fiction which records the stories of survivors of the zombie apocalypse from all over the world, and from all walks of life. Some from mothers and sons, others from soldiers and government officials. This book is told in an interview-style narrative. The author acts as interviewer, traveling around the world, and seeking answers about the virus. He inquires into why and how the virus was developed, and how far in advanced the government knew about it. This book quickly gained a spot on my top 5 shelf because of the style it is written in. It's completely unique, but also very smart. This isn't another zombie book about a group surviving the apocalypse. This is a great prose on the after effects of war, and human nature. I would recommend this book to zombie enthusiasts and regular folk alike. It's fast paced enough not to lose your attention, and smart enough to get you wrapped up in right away."
2,hard to get into,I have friends that read this and flew through the whole thing. For me some reason I have a hard time with it. I like the story and the idea of it but the way it is written is just hard for me to read. I am into it for a few pages then the writing just makes me tired. I still have not finished it. I may just wait for the movie.
5,"Brooks' ""World War Z""","One of my favorite books, ""World War Z"" grabbed me in a way few stories have. I love zombies, but I think it's horribly unfair to write this off as ""another zombie book."" It's so very much more. Yes, there are zombies, lots of them, but this isn't their story. If anything, it's a human story and an exploration of what humanity is capable of when pushed. The best and worst of human nature is highlighted. The zombies are not the villains in this book, they merely are. They are a catalyst, a foil to compare and contrast living people against, and sometimes the zombies were the less evil of the two.I recommend this story to anyone who loves good fiction. Even if you aren't a zombie fan per se, give it a try. You may be surprised."
4,Enjoyable,"I love a good zombie story. This book had good zombie stories. Its starts out slow,with some the stories being repetitive. However overall the stories vary. The stories at the space station,Yonkers, and northern Canada were my favorites."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"It's interesting at first, but then starts to feel repetitive and gets boring. Since it is just a collection of interviews, it is impossible to feel for any characters and root for them to succeed. I read the first 50 pages pretty fast, but now it has been very hard for me to finish."
4,What a great book!,"I totally LOVE this book! It's one of the best Saddle Club books ever! Another one of my favorites is Hobbyhorse, you should try that one, too.The storyline is that the Saddle Club all make New Year's resolutions. Carole's is to eat less junk food, Stevie's is to be nice to a brat named Veronica, and Lisa's is to learn embroidery. The Saddle Club gets into quarrels about their resolutions, too. They also have to call a weirdo nerd boy named Simon and get him into Horse Wise, which is in jeopardy.I love this book and all of the other Saddle Club books! You should read this book!"
1,"Good arrangements, but much too short.","This album contains 10 classic Christmas songs, done well in a traditional ""brass band"" approach. Unfortunately, the average length of each song is slightly over one minute. The total running time for this album is just over 16 minutes. Steer past this one."
5,Charlie is a refreshing and inspiring artist.,Pure Charlie Peacock at his finest. Charlie's unique ability to inspire through his music is overwhelming. This CD is a must.
4,Got what it said,"I got everything that was saidI haven't tried these yet but to me rollers are rollers.A lot smaller than I expectedSo I ordered some smaller rollers for 2.95$ on here just in case I run out and need some for small areas.The only reason I rate this 4 stars is the processing I ordered these on the dec ,28th ,2012 . And just now got them on jan,7,2013 but its ok glad the waits over withOver all get these its the best deal on amazon, I will upload a customer image of what they look like, mine is the one with the orange sheets in the background ."
5,"Nice, functional, quality optical cable",We have a Insignia Blu-ray player and Insignia LCD TV that is wall mounted.We needed hi quality optical cable to make sure that signal was not going to degrade over the long run that we needed to have in our bedroom.6 months later and I am happy to report this cable work with no problems. I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs to do long runs of optical signal.
3,"IDE only, not for SATA","The price was right, the product looks fine, but nowhere in the description is this product identified as being for either IDE or SATA (well, it's for IDE). Shame on me for being hasty in not catching this detail: I needed an enclosure for a 1T SATA HDD that I already have.For the price, I'll keep it around as a way to fiddle with the surplus IDE drives I have, but none of them have the juice to be the home network backup drive I was hoping to build.Another $50+ and I'll have the correct SATA-compatible NAS-like enclosure.The merchant did a good job packaging and shipping expeditiously, so I cannot fault them in that regard."
5,Miracle of Mixing Technics of Fuentes,Fuentes presents Techno Remixed Mambo Album.This Album created other world of Original Perez Prado's Mambo. Best of Latin Mix Albums.
4,A Good Read Anyday,"Susan Haley's ""Rainy Day People"" falls somewhere between a chick-lit novel and a sensitive memoir. It's a story about Ben and Amber and the life they share, both together and alone. It's a story about living and dying, love and hate, peace and turmoil. It's a story about the environment and the valuable creatures we share it with. It is also a story about the permanent state of transition that seems to characterize much of the world right now. In short, ""Rainy Day People"" is a good read any day, whether it's raining or not.Russ Heitz, Sarasota, Florida, USAAuthor of the soon-to-be-released suspense novel ""Crosshairs"""
4,A Refreshing Change,"This is a book that follows a different path. It is a love story that doesn't feature young, hard bodied protagonists, but two people that have been around the block a time or three and are trying to find new meaning in their lives. It is an adventure that doesn't feature car chases and firearms, but an adventure of spirit and discovery. It is a story to which real people can relate.Meet Amber and Ben. Amber is a strong, vibrant widow trying to find meaning in life after the death of her husband, Jeff. Ben is a mysterious man that can be a bit aloof, and seems to be trying to reconcile himself with his past. Amber and Ben have different views on life and love, but have an instant connection that bridges those differences.Can their love carry them together into a new life of happiness? It would seem so, but Ben has a secret that could tear them apart. Crack open this gem and, with Ben and Amber, discover the power of love."
1,WRING ITEM DESPITE CLEAR INDICATION,THIS COMPANY SENT INCORRECT ITEM ENTIRELY. THIS DESPITE IT WAS CLEARLY MARKED AND ORDERED CORRECTLY. I SUSPECT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE IT AND JUST HOPED CUSTOMER WOULD ACCEPT AN ALTERNATIVE AND NOT MAKE A FUSS OVER THE INCORRECT ITEM. OR... THEIR QUALITY CONTROL AND PEOPLE PACKING ITEM JUST DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO ORDERS. EITHER WAY... I DID NOT EVEN ORDER A MOCASON BUT A MINNETOINKA MENS WING GORE SHEEPSKIN SLIPPER TAN. SIZE 15..HOW DO YOU MISS ALL THAT FOR A MOCASIN>? NOW I HAVE TO SPEND TIME AND ENERGY RECOUPILNG MY MONEY AND SENDING ITEM BACK.
3,Stiches came off...,"I bought a pair for a Christmas gift for my husband. He absolutely LOVED everything - that 1)it's made in USA, 2) it's snugly and keep his feet warm, and 3) the rubber is firm and grips the floor well...until, third week into wearing the slippers, stitches on the side on one of the foot started to come off. We didn't want to pull the thread, but as he continues to wear, the top part of the thread totally came off and now I can put my finger in the whole. I didn't expect this from all the reviews that I've read, especially when I compared the quality with other cheap brands, I certainly expected it to last a little longer...."
3,looked nice but on the small side,"I ordered a US size 11 (which I fit 95% of the time) and the pair I got were at least a size too small for me. So, sent them back."
3,"Quality bag, but pungent chemical odor!","This is a quality made bag with plenty of room for sparring gear etc. My only ""Major"" gripe is that it arrived with and still has maintained a ridiculous pungent chemical odor that I have yet been able to get rid of. I have washed it numerous times, planted air fresheners in it and doused it with cologne and still no success. If I was aware of this prior to the purchase I would have never invested regardless the quality. Tiger Claw needs to seriously consider the materials or treatment chemicals that are applied to these bags and change immediately for everyone's sake."
4,ultra wide but not,"Thinking of a nice wide angle without the vinette and distortion, or fisheye this is the perfect lens i have read up on the mk 1 and it is in no comparison to this lens after having owned it. I got shots while in a corner of a 15x15 room that covers everything while in focus and sharp... nice lens and i was concerned about different focal lengths but they all came out great... I have used each lens like a 20mm f1.2, 24mm f1.4, and 35mm f1.2 and those are some kick butt lenses... but this cover those ranges well. You can still achieve nice bokeh at f2.8... a great all around lens for close range."
5,Excellent lens,"Excellent lens, images have a superb quality typically associated with Canon ""L"" series. Someone really needs to pay attention to how it is being used, perspective on a subject, photo composition and the resulting images will not disappoint! Use it without considering those factors - and you might be disappointed. Also, this is a lens that I would recommend for a full frame sensor camera - I have great results using it with my EOS 5D Mark II and had just an OK result using it on my crop sensor Canon 60D due to the 1.6 factor that really killed the ""wide lens"" idea"
5,A great wide angle lens for full frame cameras,"This lens is the bread and butter of my photography. A very solid lens where this replaced my 17-55 IS canon lens. I did not like my EFS 17-55 lens as it seemed cheaply constructed, zoom and focus rings had almost no resistance, and it sucked in dirt behind the front lens element. With the 16-35 lens I will have it for my entire life and it will always be there ready to serve its purpose."
5,Perhaps my most versatile lens. Excellent quality!,"I now own 4 ""L"" lenses (see below). This 16-35mm f/2.8L is perhaps the most versatile for my needs. I often shoot interiors and landscapes at the wider ranges and the overall quality is excellent. The build quality of this lens is superb (as it should be). The lens is fast, quiet, focuses quickly, and I have no complaints. - When I'm shooting indoors where there are lots of people, this is the lens I use.Canon Digital EOS 40DCanon EF 50mm f/1.2L USMCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USMCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USMCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USMCanon EF 1.4X II Extender"
5,"Excellent, singing of traditional gospel songs & hymns","This is one of the best CD's I own of traditional gospel songs & hymns, which are sung beautifully and with deep devotion and spirit. I only wish this group had another CD. I would certainly buy it. If anyone finds another gospel CD like this one, please let me know. ..."
4,Farm animals bath toy,My daughter likes this toy. I like to teach her the animals names and the sounds they make. Fun & educational!
3,Bath Foam Stickers,"Fun bath toy - my children love it; however, it does not stick on the bathtub wall as well or slips off quickly."
4,Good Software,"I'm very thankful for this product because it works with my HP PSC 2175 printer whereas a recent version of Print Master Gold and I believe it was Print Workshop that I tried which did not. The features are great and making cards, banners, and calendars that I have tried is easy. It might be nice if the graphics choosing window could display clipart a bit larger at times so one wouldn't have to waste time previewing individual clipart images he may or may not want, and it might be nice if the program would not have ""lost"" my projects when I moved the projects folder, but most won't run into that little difficulty. Overall this is a great package, especially comparing it to the version 5 I have from years ago and to the two other programs mentioned above."
2,Why can't I see what I am working on?????,"I have used Print Shop Deluxe products for years with no problems. I had an older version on my computer but purchased this when I got my new computer with XP and no longer had the installation disk for the other version. I have to click on the print preview button to see what I am working on otherwise all I see is a blank piece of paper in front of me. I have tried the ""so called"" web troubleshooter but no one else seems to have the same complaint. Maybe these newer programs just run that way. I also downloaded a free trial of Print Master 15 and had the same problem. I would love some actual help with this but can't seem to find it so the program is going back!!!!!"
2,"After 15 versions, you'd think they'd get it right!","Good old Print Shop! I have a love/hate relationship with it. On the one hand, it is the greatest thing going for arranging ""objects"" like text boxes, photographs and other graphics on a page for producing greeting cards, signs and the like. Fifteen is the third version I have purchased, and it features a custom paper wizard, with which you are supposed to be able to create a template for unique paper sizes. First of all, there are only a few formats available upon which the wizard can work its magic. Second of all, it doesn't work very well. I wasted HOURS trying to get some cards printed without having the objects print crazily off the edge of the paper. All I succeeded in doing was to mess up the standard half fold card template, after which it was trial and error and a lot of wasted paper before I got a card presentable enough to send. As long as you aren't too creative, The Print Shop is a useful workhorse of a tool for home printing."
2,Not a lot of bang for the buck,"I have previous versions of the Print Shop and thought it was good. I purchased PrintShop Deluxe on DVD, Ver. 15 because I couldn't get my old program to work on my new computer with WinXP. The new version seems to rely only on its built in graphics, photos and templates. There are not a lot of tools to do your own thing. I also had immediate problems with the software in scrolling through the fonts -- the program freezes. This is apparently a well-known problem to Broderbund as their ""fix"" on the web page is to delete several of the fonts. When I asked why (through their customer service site) there was no fix and they thought it was acceptable to delete fonts, they blamed it on XP and then invited me to buy their newest version. I guess I thought that's what I was doing when I was at CompUSA. Now I know...they keep the old [stuff] out there until it's sold out."
5,Perfect Rock,"Just a greta cd... i bought this with 30 Seconds to Mars and neitehr album disappointed. Both are just great works of rock music. This album is less produced and still has a great sound and has pure energy, something rock hasn't had since Nirvana and Alice in Chains. It sucks they broke up because this album is close to perfect, and in terms or my favorite albums, is perfect ... buy it with Flaw's ""Through the Eyes"" and 30 Seconds to Mars. Thats how i would listen to it"
2,Comfortable,Too short for my yard tool. Gas 4 stroke edger is at a poor ergonomic angle but could not find a longer strap.
3,Better than a standard strap,"It's OK - not as padded as you would expect, but it's better than what comes standard with most laptop cases. The biggest pain is that the attachment hooks are not mounted on a swivel as most are, so it can easily get twisted up."
4,very good,Very good quality these straps are used at least 5 days per week on servoce kits used on average 12 times per day.
4,Nice Shoulder Strap,"I wanted a shoulder strap for my weedeater and leaf blower, and I decieded on trying this one. Fully extended, it is the perfect length for me. However, I'm 6ft., and if I was a little taller I dont think the strap would have been long enough."
1,Stay away,"Absolutely terrible. Apparently, they gave me my money back, but I dont see it in my online banking. So...they walked off with my money and i still dont have my freaking book. Find more reasonable people to buy from."
5,My son & I both loved this book!,He picked this up at the school Library & we both enjoyed this book very much. Quick & easy for him to read.
2,Not up to standard...,"But maybe that is because this was originally released in the late 1980's, before she began writing realistic fiction. If you like McDaniel, give it a read, but be warned not to expect too much from it."
4,Everything it promises,It promises 1000 pages for $19.99 and it delivers exactly 1000 pages including the index. You actually get a nice book that I have used for reference and some learning. Nothing ground breaking. I recommend this book for experienced programmers that need to do a little Java. It is not for a novice starting from scratch. If you don't know an object from a class you will be wasting your money. There are much better books for that.
3,Is it a buff color?,"I received the flag last week and am confused about the color. The official color of New Jersey flag is buff color and this one is definitely not buff. It is bright yellow(or orange?). I did carry a buff New Jersey in front of my house before. And since the old one wears out, I purchaseed this one from Amazon. This new flag is too stunning because of its bright color. I am thinking to return that, but I already tear off one of its tag after I talked to my husband, so I have to keep it."
5,Heart Strings,"This has to be the best book I have ever read. So true to life. Growing up in the northeast Pennsylvania, it made me laugh and cry. But most of all it made me remember."
5,Better than SHop Vac Hose,"Used this and a reducer to suck the dust from my benchsander and spindle sander. Keeps the air almost dust free. Softer and clamps better than shop vac hose. Still quite stiff. It is hard to make more than an 8"" radius bend with it. Defintely stiff enough to resist flattening."
4,Suzuka volume 3 DVD review,"If you've been enjoying the Suzuka anime you will most likely enjoy this volume. It contains a major plot twist that helps keep the story fresh after the climax of volume two. The animation and voices (Japanese) are well above average, so it's easy to get into the story without being distracted, but this being volume three of the series I'm sure you've already made your mind up about those aspects. One thing I do find a bit strange is how they have pictures of characters in the original manga style rather than the quite different anime style on the DVD cover. Overall a great addition to this apparently polarizing anime series."
1,FIVE STARS!,"Well, I dunno what all these other people were smoking when they wrote their reviews, but ah, this book was ridiculously BORING! From a young adult (18-years-old)'s point of a view, the plot of this book was sappy, drawn out to the point of boring me to tears and just not worth the five bucks I shelled out for it. So save your money for a book thats actually worth the money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,"IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HANG THIS ITEM ON THE WALL!!This item requires a special mounting bracket to be hung on the wall which is not included, and is not sold separately. Unfortunately, the material surrounding the board is foam, so you can't mount it without the bracket.The only way to obtain the bracket is by purchasing the MMS200, which is a set of two of these boards and one bracket. I guess this item could work as an additional board, but I can't understand why you would ever want more boards than places to hang them. I bought this board because it is the perfect size for my wall here in the office, so I can't buy a set of two anyway because they won't fit.I've confirmed over the phone with the manufacturer that there is no way for me to get the bracket to hang my board, and they suggested I return the item. I suggest avoiding this company altogether."
3,Used every weekend for one summer.,"It's tough to keep steady temperature, constantly adjusting. Frozen fries seemed to bring the temperature down too quickly and took too long to recover, so we only made fresh cut french fries and frozen chicken patties. Did a good job, but you have to babysit it."
4,Great product,The shade works very well and everyone asks where I got it. My children bought first and then convinced me to purchase.
3,Of Local Interest,"A history of St. Patrick of Armagh, a Catholic parish in Franklin County, Missouri, and its principal pastors between 1844 and the end of the nineteenth century. Some mention of two nearby parishes: St. Bridget's and St. Columbkille's. A few lay parishioners in St. Patrick's Benevolent Society, founded in 1865. The parish library and graveyard. A book of regional interest to Catholics in Franklin and Jefferson counties, Missouri. The original church was four miles south of Pacific, Missouri, on the Meramec River. The later church still stands at Catawissa, Missouri.The author (1864-1950) was a local farmer, school teacher, church organist and choir director, whose ancestors were among the earliest members of the parish."
3,.....a JET ?!? Jets! Jets! I HATE JETS!,"Even though the cartoons this music is taken from are all awesome -- this cd is a bit of a disappointment. For one thing, there's only six tracks, none of which involve Red Hot Red singing ""Oh Woolfy."" Not to mention the tracks all include the sound effects/vocal tracks from the cartoons. Even though it's fun to listen to bits from ""Cell bound"" or ""Little Johnny Jet"" I can watch the dvd's of the cartoons whenever I want; with this cd I was really hoping to listen to Scott Bradley's music on it's own.Nonetheless it's fun to own, and worth having in your collection if you're an Avery fan.."
4,Nice quality slight flaw,"I like this but,one of the owls has a weak stamping.It was the upside down owl and you wouldn't even notice it unless you looked hard enough.Find your friends birthday and match up his/her celtic sign and get one of these this as a gift."
4,Adorable!,"This shoe is adorable! It looks a lot better in person. When you order it, you should get a half size smaller. It's comfortable, but I wouldn't recommend walking in them all day."
1,No puffy coat? Why the change of packaging?,"Complain about the music all you want, but I am mad at Universal for their inexcusable way of marketing the DVDs. First they give us crappy double sided DVDs for the series. And now for season 3, they have changed the format of the packaging. Now they do not match and you can't even tell it is the same set when all three seasons are next to each other on a shelf. Universal needs to be responsible and at least allow people to order a green puffy coat for $5 or whatever so that they can get their highly priced sets to match.PLEASE MAKE THE COATS AVAILABLE BY MAIL!"
2,Too cheap to buy the music rights,"I have to agree with the reviewers who are complaining about the original music not being in the DVDs. I first noticed it in the scene where Maurice arrives in the bar drunk during his mid-life crisis. ""Family Tradition"" by Hank Williams, Jr. was missing from the scene. As I investigated more, I noticed very pivotal musical numbers were missing from other scenes. And, when the characters are in the Brick, THOSE signature songs are missing, and replaced by really crappy milquetoast elevator music. It ruins the episodes for me. This might not all be Universal's fault. ASCAP and BMI have gotten particularly greedy when it comes to re-usage rights. It sucks for the consumer. In the case of Northern Exposure, in many, many scenes, it just falls apart."
4,Still my favorite show,"I didn't watch Northern exposure to listen to the music. I did not buy the DVD's hoping for 3 hours of additional (and often boring) extras. I bought them because I love the characters, the dialogue, the setting and and overall writing and concept of the show. And despite the often mentioned faults and lack of care given to the production of these DVD's, what I loved about Northern Exposure is still there and is such a relief and dare I say uplifting after all the plotless, mindless and outright cruel reality shows that have take over the airwaves."
5,the best version of the Odyssey for children,"I just finished reading the Wanderings of Odysseus to my five year old. Most people would hesitate to read something so complex to one so young, but Ms. Sutcliff breaks up the scenes into manageable bits, which are beautifully illustrated. And while I did need to simplify and explain many of Ms. Sutcliff's words to my little one, she actually looked forward to reading it.I guess the best compliment that I can pay to this version, is that I read it 3 years ago to my oldest child who was then 5. As I read it to my younger one, my older child would come in periodically to find out what part we were on. He still remembered it quite well and even stopped to listen to it frequently. There are precious few books that appeal to so many ages."
5,Top notch Indian flavored electronica,"If you've acquired a taste for mellow electronica with world groove flavors, I assure you this is one of the best collections ever. 2 discs, absolutely solid all the way through!"
3,Not as good as the slacks,"They weren't joking when they said, ""Relaxed Fit!"" I have fairly large quads/thighs from weight lifting, and these jeans were way too baggy for me! I have a pair of slacks in the same Workhorse model, and I am very happy with those."
2,Shipping costs too high,"I'm not sure how they came up with the 13 lb cookie sheet, but it causes the shipping costs from the non-Amazon supplier to be more than half the cost of the cookie sheet."
2,best part was mothers journal,"As you know this book is the merging of 2 cross country accounts. The mothers journal from the 1950's was FASCINATING. Wish there had been more of it. The authors (daughter and husband) part of it was mediocre at best.Daughter and Husband do lots of complaining about Recreational Vehicles. Lots and lots and lots of complaining about Recreational Vehicles. Still interesting though with the 1950's material.If you have not read it yet read ""Miles from Nowhere"" by barbara savage instead.Peter Soldan"
5,Eyebrow Enhancer GOLD,"This product is a must, must, must have for anyone who desires or requires enhanced eyebrows. I plucked far too many years ago and who knew then they wouldn't continue to grow back & remain full? I've been giving different high-end cosmetic lines a shot for 30 years in an attempt to make enhancing my brows a simple process resulting in a natural look. I had limited success with a few but none were quite perfect. What Shiseido has created is ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. You'd be crazy to not give this a try...and at this price you'd be really crazy."
4,"Good, but not great...","This is definately one of the better packages for Tennessee Ernie Ford. It contains hard to find hymns such as ""Wafaring Pilgrim"" and ""Stand by Me"", as well as the favorite ""The Old Rugged Cross"". Personally, I recommend the Gaither Edition. It has 40 hymns adding fifteen more to the collection. It also contain three tracks from his contemporay gospel album Make A Joyful Noise. And surprise, surprise it has the same liner notes."
3,Eleven fun cumbias - Try it!,"Although not well-known in the US, this group of Mexican musicians works well together. Their voices blend very well, and their music is creative and diverse. This, their second CD, is fun...especially if you like cumbias. However, it may actually be better if you don't understand the words of some of the songs! Yahari's first CD (Mensaje en la luna) is much better and definitely five stars...if you can find it. I hope they do more like it in the future. The ballads on that CD are beautiful."
3,Too bleak?,"I picked this up because the back copy compared it to Jim Thompson. The comparison is apt -- Simenon, like Thompson, writes seemingly simple prose laced with menace -- but it doesn't hold up. You can tell Simenon is writing on autopilot some of the time here. Still, when he's fully on, this book is as scary as they come."
3,An average music release,"In the past several years, I have enjoyed Blue October's first two releases, Incoming and Preaching Lies to the Righteous, with the latter being the perceived best. One Day Silver, One Day Gold is not a ""bad"" CD but appears to lack what its predecessors managed to obtain."
3,"Comfortable, but stretches out","The set is really adorable and comfortable, but the shirt is made so that it gets wider and shorter every time you wash it. It's a good idea to go to Carole Hochman's website and use her sizing guide before you buy this."
2,Nearly worthless.,"I bought this to replace a worn-out Emjoy Gold Caress (which worked great, by the way). This thing certainly was 'Sin Dolor' (Painless). It also did not do the job. I went over and over a couple of long hairs but it just wouldn't get them. Ended up tweezing. I am going to go for another Gold Caress, or may try the Braun epilator."
4,Fits my generic import sander,"I have a generic spindle sander from taiwan. Pretty similar to the jet machine (perhaps even made in same factory). Purchased these sleeves and they fit my bench mounted generic unit just fine. Note that these sleeves are available in two lengths, one for smaller bench mounted machines and one for the larger floor standing spindle sanders. Make sure you get the correct sleeves :)"
4,A good collection ...,"Very possibly the only book (or one of few books) of its kind out there, which benefits its value; however, the idential sayings from the cannonical gospels and the gospel of Thomas are all considered individually, so it gets somewhat repetitive. A decent source, though."
3,Erratic performance,"I use children's toothbrushes to reach my back teeth, plus they are far more fun to look at than ""grown-up"" brushes. The Tigger version has problems: sometimes it runs erratically, sometimes it runs fine, and sometimes it doesn't run at all. Now I shake it before I try to start it, and that usually works. I could return it, but one can use an electric toothbrush in the manual mode, so I decided a return was too much trouble. I have the Winnie the Pooh from the same product line, and I have had no trouble with it."
3,the living blues?,"Miss. may be the home of the blues, but I traveled up and down the Delta for a few weeks in 2000 and saw mainly a series of ghost towns. Saw T Model playing for 2 tourists in a faked up juke joint in Greenville, while a group of local blacks gathered around a youthful R and B band playing outside. T Model told me he didn't start playing guitar until he was retired from his truck driving job. The Delta is mainly vast stretches of flat tilled land tended by machines, irrigation wands and crop planes. There aren't many laborers left, just a few tractor drivers, and the poverty is sometimes dire. The towns look vacant and dusty and the juke joints, if you can find one, are rarely open. What's left is the dream of a past that was probably a lot uglier than we can imagine."
4,Great substitute for pricier ones,"Great substitute for pricier ones. Looks to be good quality for a old fashioned tub. Using in our master bedroom. Others were priced at several hundred dollars.....but I wasn't going to waste money on a holder of soap for the tub, whenThe tub is the nice focal point. If this one tarnishes, we will get another!"
4,A Hero,"In his book, Pete Rose: Without Bars, Pete Rose comes clean on his life in and out of baseball.Known as the man who holds more major league records than any other player in history, Rose is a beloved star. He notes he is not perfect and his one weakness has been gambling. Some people have hobbies, Rose did not. He gambled. He began this passion with his father who used to take him to the track. This vice led to his eviction from baseball. A tough sentence.Rose also got convicted for tax evasion and spent five months in prison.This book is more about a nostalgic look of one man's sports career but really about the highs and lows of a man who has learned to weather the storm but still wants to be accepted back into his proven profession of baseball."
3,Don't waste your time,As most autobiographies or memoirs this book is self-serving. I grew up watching Pete play for the Reds. I think this book was written for therapy and Pete is still in denial. I only read the book to past some time around the holidays. Don't waste your time reading the book.
1,The WORST you can buy,"I don't know who ""remanufactured"" these units, but they are incompetent. I have never received an item in worse condition from Amazon (and I bought two): no manuals, no tuning ability, no function with cable. On and on. Don't even think about buying this junk. Additionally, if anything is ever shown as being shipped by ""Eagle""...run for the hills. They show stuff as shipped that has never been shipped and are slow when they do ship. The worst experience."
4,great system but the cd player dies in less then a year,I just saw the price from the seller. $ 700.00!!!!!!!!! 5 months ago I paid $279.00 My next system has to have a 5 cd player!
5,Very Satisfied,"I was so satisfied after purchasing the MHC-GX250 five months ago for my bedroom that I went out and purchased the Sony MHC-GX450 for my living room. The results have been just as great as my first system. Simple and easy to set up, it took me all five minutes to get it up and running. The bass on this thing is crazy, which is great for parties and get-togethers. If volume is what you want, you'll definitely get it from this system. The difference between this system and the MHC-GX250 is the this one comes equipped with an extra 325 watts, which becomes very evident when you want to crank it up to the next level. Surprisingly, it delivers light music just as well as it does heavy. I just turn the bass off and switch it to either 'jazz' or 'soul' mode, and I'm sleeping like a baby. Since I bought it, there haven't been any problems with the unit. This is a great system for the price and I encourage potential buyers to search no further."
4,Brief but nice overview of the subject,"Although this book is so brief that it can be read in a few minutes, it contains many marvellous color photographs of the chinese terracotta army and also gives interesting details regarding the first Chinese emperor and the nature of the armies of his times. One page is also devoted to the mystery of the Fourth Pit which was excavated but found empty of figures."
5,ANOTHER HIT FROM THE BOYZ,"Wow!!.I give up!!. There is truly no end in sight for the isley brothers!!!.When you think it's over, they come right back again!.This album is completely new territory.With Mr Robert Kelly on board,it's going to be unique!!.I can only imagine the amount of new fans gained. 'cause this hot album is made for this time,for this generation.Drama songs like ""showdown"" and ""busted"" are blazing hot!! ""body kiss"" is uncensored nine yards intimacy!!,we got cool gems like ""lucky charm"" and ""take a ride"" will keep you calm. Hip hop based pieces like ""i like"" and ""what would you do"" pts 1&2 will get you as well. ""Superstar"",""keep it flowing"" and ""prize possession"" are pretty decent in thier own right. Coming in at 12 pieces this amazing album is full of the WOW factor!!!.I suggest this excellent piece of art to all isley fans, and to those who want to be!!. You're gonna like the territory you're in!!!."
4,R. Kelly does it again!!!,"Isley Brothers Top Album Chart First Time In Nearly 30 YearsThe Isley Brothers have scored their first Number One album in almost 30 years with Body Kiss, which debuted on top of the Billboard chart this week. The release sold more than 150,000 copies in the U.S. It's the Isley's first Number One on the chart since 1975's The Heat Is On. The album's single, ""What Would You Do?,"" is in the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart.R. Kelly does it again!!!Favourite tracks:- Take A Ride- Lucky Charm- Body Kiss- I Like- What Would You Do?Finally, 150,000 people CAN'T be wrong...so better get this cd a.s.a.p."
2,I Wanted Ronald Not R,"In listening to Body Kiss, I could not help but hear R Kelly all throughout the CD. Now that Ronald Isley has taken on the Mr. Bigg persona via Mr. Pied Piper, getting him to produce the whole album vs one or two cuts as in the recent past was a mistake. I am afraid that those of us who remember the real Isley Brothers vs the latest incarnation will be disappointed. Now in giving the album a chance, I listen to it a couple of time and then listened to their previous album ""Eternal"" and this is what the Isley Brothers were to me back in the 70s. Even though it did not receive any airplay, the title track ""Eternal"" is a beautiful love song. What in the world is Lil Kim and Snoop Dogg doing on a Isley Brothers CD? Mr. Pied Piper did a remix of the main song on the CD ""What Would You Do?"" at the end of the CD and man, that is horrible. Word to Ronald Isley - put Mr. Bigg to rest, use R/Pied Piper sparingly and get back to the formula that most of us remember the Isley Brothers for."
3,Not bad for the money.,"Keeps coffee hot for a couple hours. It isn't as effective as glass but if you 'pre-heat' it with hot water, it does extend the time. I also find it leaks a lot if it is tipped over in the car. Hubby had it in a pack on the bike for 20 minutes and it was quite a mess. This summer he has a new thermos!Basically - if you only need a few hours on the counter - this will do the job just fine."
1,An Exercise in Futility,"This carafe was a waste of my time and Amazon's advertising space. It was shoddily manufactured and did not measure up to Amazon standards by a long stretch. The connector attaching the bottom of the handle to the body of the carafe was shaky and insufficiently anchored and pulled loose the first time the carafe was filled with hot water to prepare it for a filling of coffee. Then, once I filled the carafe it only kept the coffee warm for about 3 hours total. Totally unsatisfactory. I don't remember whether I said this before, but the product was extremely disappointing and looked like it was a reject."
2,hmmmm...,"i would say that i bought a carafe because i wanted to transport coffee. well it doesnt work for transporting coffee. see that black plastic rim? well it leaks. so dont tip it over, and that includes tipping it to pour your coffee. i would buy a different one, but it's not in my budget. so it's going in the trash...."
4,"""Strangled"" re-opens a forty year old case","This latest in McGrory's Jack Flynn series is the best to date. The story offers a fresh, fictional look at the puzzling real-life Boston Strangler serial murders when, forty years later, Boston ""Record"" reporter Flynn is chosen as spokesperson for the perpetrator of a similar series of murders and becomes the traget of someone who wants him out of the way. Is the Strangler back? Was now deceased Albert DiSalvo not really the serial killer he claimed to be? Who doesn't want the truth revealed?""Strangled"" is a fast-paced shuttle between Boston and Vegas that conveys the strikingly different energy of both cities. I loved it."
2,I was disappointed in this book :-(,"I found this book when I was buying the Captains table book. It was one of those, ""if you like this, you'll like these too"" lists Amazon gives us. Hey! It looked great! Pictures of three Starships, a Revolutionary war schooner, and a Aircraft Carrier! ""The History of the Enterprise!"" It says. I am a Star Trek Fan. I have been from when I was very young. I watch and read Trek books for the adventure and action. There is very little of that in these stories. These stories seem to be morality plays more than adventure stories. I feel it only deserves 2 stars because only 2 of the stories in this book are OK. And they are stories about the Starship captains you hardly ever hear about. Lastly, these are extremely short, short stories. Not barely worth the price. Before you buy on-line, go see it in a store, and look it over and read some of it. Then decide."
5,SHE IS THE BEST,"NADIA NADIA NADIA CANTA BONITO CANTALE, EH EH EH QUE TE APOYAMOS SIGUELE!!! www.nadiayvonne.com NADIA ERES LA MEJOR!"
3,good but straps are too short,Would have been perfect if only the straps were longer. Too short for the average adult. Too bad because it's otherwise a perfect backpack and so lightweight.
4,Taking this to South Africa,"I just bought this small daypack from TravelSmith - and am taking it to South Africa next week. I'm popping it in my larger backpack to use on day trips in kruger Park. I love the feel of this daypack, and the lightness of it. I plan to use it for camera, water, anti-mosquito spray, etc. I don't know how it will hold up over time, but my initial impression of it is quite positive. I'll check back after my trip."
1,Poor construction,"My wife and I both bought one of these packs to use in Europe. At first they seemed great but within a week they both had problems with the cords on the side bottle holders. The cord covers came away from the inside and bunched up, also, one of the cord ends came out of the seam. Also, as noted already, the zippers had issues with getting jammed due to manufacturing defects in the material. I am sure Mr. Steves would be disappointed to know that his name is associated with this product."
2,Item Misrepresented in Photograph,"The item as pictured is misleading. The items for sale are only the the items on the table top, not the PB-1 portable work stand/table unit. The main table unit is sold seperately, as are the wheels and cargo plate. To buy what is pictured would be more than $300.00. Caveat Emptor!!"
4,My bad - should have read ALL the reviews!,I own Get Moving - Walking for Weight Loss - a favortie and regular in my exercise program. I was looking for more of Madeleine's workouts. I read only a couple of the reveiws and missed the one that heads warning this is only a RE-RELEASE of Get Moving - Walking for Weight Loss.When I got the DVD I had a sinking feeling I got a dupe (or got duped). I expect a bit more from Gaiam.Long and short if you do not own Get Moving both (obviously) are a wonderful workout with three 10 minute sections and three levels to work at. Good lead ins - nice variety of movements and a soothing cool down.
2,"Good idea, but . . .","From the reviews, I hoped for an engaging story. However, this is mediocre high-school level writing. Among other things, the narrative is stilted and choppy, there is no character development, and there has obviously been no editing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of evidence of research and creative ideas. Take some writing classes, La Ertes! You've got good ideas, but you don't have a clue what to do with them! This is the first time I've been so badly led astray by Amazon reader reviews!"
4,Horra/Thrilla,"I just love the new genre that LaErtes has created called Horra/Thrilla. His first book, Evolve - An Anthology of Horra/Thrilla, showed me there is a new Storyteller on the seen. His latest released novel, Manawydan, caught me totally off guard with his storytelling improvements. I'm Liking it! I'm Liking it a Lot! This storyteller's star is on the rise so keep your eyes on ""LaErtes, the King of Horra/Thrilla!"""
3,its ok,"i bought this gauge to use on my turbo charged car, i just wanted to know what my boost was set for and keep an eye on vac. pressure. it is a nice looking gauge and it does work, it's alittle noisy and the calibration is off already. if you are looking for just a gauge to monitor vac and turbo press. it will work but if you want something alittle more accurate you are going to want to pay alittle more for it. thats my take on this product. either way i am going to keep it because it gives me a ball park idea of what my vac. and boost press. is. hope this helped"
1,HIstory of Television's The Virginian 1962-1971,"I was very disappointed in the book, I expected it to have a lot of history about the television series and more pictures. I expected it to be like ""The Gunsmoke"" history books. I'm sorry I purchased it at such an expensive price, in my opinion it is not worth the cost."
4,"Light,mellow 80's style Azymuth","I'm giving this album 4 stars somewhat against my better judgement. Compared to a vast majority of other jazz albums it's a total 10 out of 10, but when compared to other Azymuth masterpieces like Light as a Feather,Outubro or Telecommunication its a little lacking on the soul and funk.Still it's a fantastic album that I find myself enjoying when I'm in a mellow mood and want to relax."
3,Blame it on the volcano,"I am going with a neutral review for this book seller. The book was not what I thought it was but that's my fault, not the seller's. They say they shipped it the day after I ordered it but, due to the disruption of air service from the volcano in Iceland, it took a long time to get to me so I can't comment on their speed of service. The 3 people I dealt with (via email) were courteous and helpful so I'll give them full marks for that."
3,"Good overall, not very specific.","Good general information, but not very detailed on any one subject. Good read if you are interested in many areas of VB programming but don't want to buy ten different books. After reading one section, if you are still interested, then you know to buy the full book on that one subject."
3,Good reference,This is a good reference book but if you are looking for details this is not the book.
3,nice,"The color appears is darker than real. the edges of the ring may caught with cloths ,especially when putting hand in pocket."
2,It really depends on what you want from the book,"If you are looking for a sweet love story, I think this is a decent book. The typos are annoying and do detract some from the story some, but its forgivable. I think the best audience for it is teenage boys.If you are looking for a realistic story though, do not get this book. It is fluffy and totally unrealistic. It is also very repetetive and states the obvious. I had to skim through a few sections because it was just saying the same thing over and over again.So it really depends on what you want. If want a light cute love story get it. But if you want something real and deep, DO NOT READ."
2,I've given up,"After reading 150 pages of this book, I just can't do it anymore. Sure, the character development is decent. However, I keep waiting for something interesting to happen. Or at least for a glimpse of humor. I'm not offended about the sex in the book, as are other reviewers. It was the one thing I was waiting for, but even that didn't excite me much. At times, the writing seemed too clumpy. I found myself skipping pages just to get to the next bit of dialogue. By page 50, I just didn't about Scott's crazy accents anymore. I just wanted him to get laid. Kendrick is a good writer though. Through his characters, it's easy to see that he has worked on his craft. I just wish that he didn't waste time with so many random details. After an hour of reading, I felt rather smothered."
2,Desert Sons,"Read a sample,then read it 30 more times and then you'll have the idea of the speed and depth of this paint drying plot. If you are a teen boy, it might mean more. If you are not, keep moving on far far away."
1,transmetropilitan slows down to stop,"i really loved parts 1-3 but this one is boring. nothing is happening here, no plot to talk about just a couple of jokes. parts 1-3 are my favorite comics books... so it is a very big dissapointment.also print sucks as usual, Vertigo uses the cheap recycled paper and the colors are dull, you can imagine how great it would look if printed in better quality."
5,Love it!,"This pan makes making blueberry scones so much easier and quicker. My recipe doesn't want to hold together because the blueberries are frozen so if I just pack the loose ""batter"" into these forms, I get perfect scones in a fraction of the time. The price is a little steep but shipping is free."
5,Texas-cook,I have used this pan several times and the scones literally pop right out. They are lightly browned on all sides and raise perfectly. I hesitated to buy at fist because of the price but am glad I did as it is a heavy weight pan that really does the job!
5,Makes scone making much easier...,"I have been making scones for years, but they frequently come out irregularly shaped. This pan makes it so easy to shape them and have a consistent size. Although I was originally intending to buy a regular sized pan, I love the mini sized scones."
3,SS Anklet w/Hearts,Very pretty. A little tight; will need an extender. Still worth the money and looks great on either ankle. Will consider buying from again in the future.
3,Kind of boring,"If you want to reinforce the idea that people with diabetes must eat bland foods then this is the book for you. The recipes are neither inventive nor creative; they are ordinary recipes with a brand name like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup or Prego tomato sauce thrown in the ingredients list. If you have never cooked, have no idea how to cook, cannot readily identify a stove ... I still wouldn't recommend this book."
5,excellent large saute pan,"I have been very happy with this pan, no sticking, plenty of space to cook in and beautifully made as well."
5,wonderful product,This liner is great...I wish it was a little higher on the sides ....but fits good and protects the back of the suv
3,If you are a real fan you'll like it,I don't understand how those who reviewed the album call themselves admirers of Luis miguel's work. I have listened to his music for almost 20 years and I can tell you that the reason this was not satisfying for them was because the songs on this album are from when Luis Miguel was 9 until about 15 or 16 years old. His Voice has changed since then but the whole point is to show you that he has been a hopeless romantic since he was a young child. Pay attention to the songs and you'll get the album title. It is a collection of his early work and if you are truly his admirer you will appreciate this album.
2,For beginers..,"This book is for beginers... Any technician who worked few months on fiber optic knows about everything in that book. However, if someone never worked with fiber optic, this is a very good introduction... If the title was: ""... an introduction..."" I certainly rate this book 5 stars."
3,Solid and informative,"The book is well organized and relatively recent. I don't know of any guides out that contain information gathered in 1999 and given that reality, this guide is very serviceable. Not as in depth as one would like but seems better than the VERY outdated alternatives."
5,Shocking Account of Stalin's Genocidal Terror-Famine,"This book is the account of a village of peasant farmers in the Ukraine who were almost all starved to death by the intentional terror-famine engineered by the genocidal dictator Josef Stalin. The prose is highly readable and relates the horrifying details from the viewpoint of a young boy trying to survive the carnage inflicted on his people by the Bolshevik program of forced collectivization of farmers. We are left with the powerful conviction that the ends most certainly do not justify the means, contrary to what the heartless Communists used to say. I strongly urge you to read this powerful, gripping and important document. The genocide of the Ukrainians must never be forgotten."
5,KYLE CEASE IS THE FUNNIEST GUY OUT THERE,SORRY DANE COOK YOU HAD YOUR TIME BUT TIME TO STEP ASIDE FOR THE MAN KYLE....YOU HAD EVERYONE AT MY HOUSE ROLLING WE WATCHED IT LIKE THREE TIMES IN ONE NIGHT!! YOUR THAN MAN BRO
1,Disappointed,"For some reason, Cease was much funnier on Comedy Central than he was on his CD. I was kinda disappointed that I didn't get the laughs I was expecting. The DVD portion of my purchase sucked and did not justify the extra ten dollars."
3,"cute, nothing great,","this is a cute stuffed animal with a hole in the butt. I got it really cheap but the 18 month old that we gave it to wasn't impressed, looked at it for 1 second and was off"
3,How is it a puppet if you can't open his mouth?,"This is not a puppet. It's a stuffed animal with a hole where you can put your hand inside. I guess I should have looked closer at the picture but the ""puppets"" mouth doesn't open. I don't think this will entertain my 16 month old very long. His favorite part is playing with the puppet's mouth...feeding it things, sticking his hands inside, etc."
3,non moving mouth,the only down side to this puppet is that it does not have a moving mouth. i thought that they just had it closed in the pic..........but i was wrong . for the price though.......cant beat it !!!!
1,Sprung a leak after only 10 months.,"I bought one of these in January 2002 and today Nov 2002 it started leaking from the bottom. Evidently the enamel got chipped on the bottom during use and then the pot metal it is made of only took a few months to corrode to the point of leaking.[For the price,] I expected this to last longer than the last teapot I bought at the grocery store... It lasted over 3 years.So much for expectations."
3,Nice enough for what it is,"This was suggested in the Style books, but it's really a glammed up history book overview of French femmes fatale over the centuries: Lots of historical factoid, with a very few touches of style advice.Entre Nous by Debra Ollivier will tell you more about how to actually be a femme fatale."
2,again...,"This band does the wannabe-chaotic-tech sound that too many terrible bands are playing today. They get effort for trying. But the riffs sound exactly like every single other wannabe-DEP/Evelynn band. They dont play technical music, but what they play has the spastic sound that makes them sound better than they really are. Please, support good bands that have talent - DEP, Eyes upon separation, Into the moat, and Converge, and not these ripoff bands like TCA."
3,WORTH LISTENING TO,"THERE ARE NO OTHER RECORDINGS OF THIS OPERA THAT I KNOW OF, SO IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO IT, YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. AS USUAL WITH OPERA D'ORO, NO LIBRETTO, SCANT LINER NOTES. FOR A RECORDING FROM 1963, THE SOUND IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE. THE ONLY ARTIST WHOSE NAME I RECOGNIZED WAS PIER MIRANDA FERRARO, WHO SINGS THE TITLE ROLE. NOT MY FAVORITE TENOR, HE PERFORMS IN TYPICAL ""VERISMO"" STYLE, THAT IS, FORCING AND SOBBING. THE REST OF THE CAST PERFORMS COMPETENTLY IF NOT BRILLIANTLY. THE MUSIC ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL, DARK AND BROODING. THIS IS A WORK THAT MERITS A REVIVAL AND WOULD BE A FINE VEHICLE FOR ANY ONE OF THE CURRENT CROP OF TENORS SUCH AS WOLVERTON OR VILLAZON."
4,A good compilation,This CD has some of Intocable's fan winning songs! I liked the way that there was a combination of cumbias and rancheras. A good album to have for those new Intocable fans! =)
2,Schools of Magic,"I bought this book as a gift, and frankly, I was dissappointed. The book deals exceedingly in those things which have totally and excessively dominated modern wicca; summoning and divination/charms. Suprised and disturbed by this (the gift was for my younger sister), I sought out other books by the author, and by contemporary writers. This book is quite typical of what I found. Instead of a concise, broad introduction to all the magical disciplines (e.g., mysticism, evocation, transmutation), I found these 'beginners' titles rife with rituals and summonings, charms and scrying. Perhaps, in its way, this is a problem with modern wicca in general, but I believe that far too many witches and wizards are forgetting the base of knowledge that made our practice great in years past. A better book (or, I should say, an acceptable book) on young girls' magic I have not found."
5,A must have for HDTVs,"If you have an HDTV and cannot place the wiring inside the wall, you definitely want this. Easy to put up, can be painted to match the walls and blends right in."
1,Worst free card I ever gotten.,"I got this card the day I went to see the""Pokemon 2000"" Movie. It was a good movie but this card was not worth it.The Front basically can peal right off the back like a sticker. Does not even feel real. I wouldnt say this card is ""rare"". The only time it was made was to give out to 1000's of people who went to see the movie."
1,not even a card,This card isn't even real. They send you a brown piece of paper that is blank. If you look at the back it says HAHA U SUCK
3,Photo better than product,"I generally don't like to purchase furniture, without seeing it in person, but I was putting a wish list together for a housewarming. From the photo, this piece would have been a perfect companion to another Queen Anne footstool I have. And I needed another one. I put it on the list and was given it as a gift. Unfortunately, it just does not have the quality I was expecting. The fabric is not stretched tight. The print is not clear. The foam is very very squishy under the fabric. The legs are of quality and sturdy. I can stand on the footstool and not feel like it will crush under my weight and I am pretty hefty. If I had seen this in a store, I would have thought it was a cheap knock off and not bought it. I will probably keep looking to replace it now with a better quality."
3,Fabric covering a bit disappointing...,"I received this product with much anticipation - the picture of it is so beautiful to me! But when I pulled it out of the box I was sad to see that the print on the fabric was not as the picture had shown. I can tell it was the same print, but in the picture, one of the floral designs is nicely centered so you can see the pattern of the other embellishments clearly, On the footstool I received, the floral design is not centered and it just isn't as pretty. Further, the colors in the picture look beautiful with pink roses and green embellishments. The ""pink"" in the stool I received is really more red and not as beautifully done as the picture led me to believe.That being said, I'll still use it and enjoy it, I just don't love it as much as I thought I would. It is built sturdily. I think the makers took earlier comments of bad construction to heart, because the legs are now supported by two metal screws. Assembly is very easy."
2,"Questionable, at best","This 'documentary' is mostly narrated stills with little or no organized, authoritative (and cited!) information - in fact it perpetuates not a few Occidental mis-conceptions about Geisha, Japan and the Orient. A tourist's slide-show glorified on DVD."
1,Don't buy this TV!!!!!,"Sony has known issues with this TV, and they will not permanently, correctly fix it. Once the warranty runs out, you're screwed! The projection bulbs are $200 so be prepared to replace them. The light module (LCD screen) wil also go bad. Your replacement will also go bad.This TV is not worth owning, and re-consider buying ANY SONY TV since they knowingly sold these TVs with serious design flaws."
1,BE AWARE - THIS TV HAS ISSUES !!!!!!!!!,"I purchased a Sony KF50WE610 in Feb of 2004. This is a secondTV in our home and is not used as frequently. In August of 05 I heard a loud ""POP"" and the TV went dead. The lamp broke. A replacement is $200.00 I have never had a 1.5 year TV breakand require $200 to repair. If I had a TV repair company come out to fix this it would add $100 - $200 to the repair bill.Either fork out the big bucks for anextended warranty (with means the product is defective) or stay away from SONY TVs!"
3,Lamp Housing,First of all the it was a great TV one of the best ones that I ever owned. We got the tv in June 2004 we never had a problem until the last 8 months. We went thru 3 bulbs in the last 6 months and at over 200.00 a pop it became costly. We had a service tech come to our home and we found out that we had something called and optic block. Then the tech removed the lamp housing and we found a greater problem the entire lamp housing had started to melt and was a fire hazard. With the tv out of warranty it was going to cost over $1500.00 to fix. The service tech called Sony and after 3 days Sony called and offered us KDL52S5100 Flat panel tv for $475.00 with a list price of over $1800.00 it was a deal that could not be passed up from Sony. I hope we get as many years out of this new one.
5,Making the case for non-discrimination laws,"A readable and closely argued guide to thinking about the means and ends of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of particular group characteristics such as race, gender, or sexuality. This book is a needed weapon against the angry-white-male demagogues who love to exploit the public's lack of understanding about why such laws exist, how they work, and why they're needed. Incidentally, one of Koppelman's important contributions as a scholar is his persuasive exposition of why discrimination against lesbians and gay men should be viewed under the law as a form of *gender* discrimination, in that it reinforces a hierarchy of gender-related roles and taboos -- the same hierarchy that laws protecting the rights of women were intended to demolish."
1,Deviating from post hardcore,"I became an instant FFTL fan upon hearing ""Secret's dont Make Friends"" and ""Ride the Wing's of Pestilence"". The songs were melodic with screams thrown in at all the right times. A great example of what the post hardcore scene is supposed to sound like. When I went out and bought ""Heroine"" I was excited to hear how they had progressed since ""Dear Diary"". The music is bearable but it was nothing that I had expected or really wanted. Songs like Mothersound were OK but lacked the intensity and were easily forgotten in my MP3 player. It seems that they had completely deviated from the post hardcore sound apparent in ""Dear Diary"", much as Funeral For a Friend has with their last two CDs.I'll be interested to see in what direction they go since Sonny has quit the band. Although its sad to see the original singer leave the band it could also lead to a much different sound then the 2nd CD which is what they really need."
2,Disappointing,"I really expected great things from this movie, but it left me sorely disappointed. With such great actors as Peck and Quinn I was sure this flick couldn't miss. Unfortunately the phony bombastic nature of the piece left me cold. Totally unrealistic( as opposed to say Moby Dick)it concentrated on lavish costumes and ornate sets with next to no attention to dialogue or story line. Quinn's character was so obnoxiusely phony and bombastic I thought I was going to be sick, as I love Quinn's work in Barrabas. The phony bravada of almost all the characters was totally unrealistic and made me sick. The ultimate in flowery Hollywood nonesense depending solely on visuals and nothing else. I see now why I never saw this before- it was being hidden for good reason..."
5,Uplifting very enjoyable,"I would like to have the lyrics to your song called ""Un million de Rosas"" Do you have this on-line, if not, how can I obtain the lyrics.Thank you"
3,not that bad,"this stuff is good too, but not good as I thought. The logo part is not very delicate. but the service of this store is very good."
2,Nothing to jump at.,"I'm 25 years old and when I was 6 or 7 my parents bought an old Nintendo games system at a garage sale. We had two games that my sister and I played on it: Mario Brothers and Sesame Street. We enjoyed it of course, but got board and ignored and stop playing it altogether. Almost 20 years role by and I am just now getting re-acquainted with video games. Needless to say Final Fantasy I and II have disapointed me with their week story line, tired box graphics, and the confusing game play. Yet, this is coming from someone who played Kingdom Hearts III on her psp before playing this."
1,DIDN'T WORK,"PRODUCT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO ARRIVE & WAS DEFECTIVE COULD NOT GET A REPLY BACK FROM SELLER. WHEN TRYING TO CONTACT SELLER, THE SITE WAS DOWN. DON'T PURCHASE THERE!!!!!!"
1,Someone should sue HP,"As with so many other purchasers, less than a year old and formatter died. HP knows it has a design defect and with this printer and instead of recalling and repairing they just continue to sell it. Boy the HP of 2011 sure resembles nothing like the company of old that put out a quality product and stood behind it. Suffice it to say, you should NOT buy this printer."
1,Atrocious,"I am almost done reading this book. The first 2 or 3 chapters are reasonably good, but then book becomes incomprehensible. There are three problems with this book. Firstly, it does not appear to have a coherent structure. Secondly, explanations are atrocious - the authors just did the assigned task of writing without any sincere intent to enlighten the reader. And thirdly, there are errors. If you can, steer away from this book. You can pick up the same information from ""Integrating Voice and Data Networks"" by Scott Keagy. That book is immeasurably better, that author really tries to drive the content home to the reader."
2,I prefer her cyborgs by far... this was meh,"I found the story dragged in the beginning. Alot. Then entered several WTF moments (mini spoiler). I found it hard to believe the heroine, beaten and threatened with gang rape gets turned on when Dax simulates raping her while inmates and a guard cheer him on. Or how about the fact they can't tell clones from real humans? The whole premise of the story is the fact they noticed it happening. This illogical fact is the basis for the hero and a whole bunch of ther people not trusting her. I love my sci-fi and futuristic stuff, but this one really needed some tighter editing on plot points."
4,Brilliant exposition for the man in the street,"To put it simply, the book is a very good read for someone unfamiliar with the science of Chaos as it traces both the history and developement of the science. However, the book has very little mathematics. As such, the more technical minded might find it far too general for their taste. This is a book for the man in the street, not the scientist in the ivory tower. The only question you may want to ask youself before you buy it is, which one are you?"
2,Not well organized,"The book presents a lot of important ideas, but they are not well organized. The anecdotes about the earlier discoverers of this field are unnecessary and distracting. The book does not discuss nonlinear dynamics in math and theoretical physics."
1,not a cream!,I am not sure if they sent me the wrong product or what happened. This is not a creme and really a liquid that you apply via cotton balls.
3,Book review,"Nice book, but I was just looking for a book just on Winchester gun description and pricing. And this gives you everything with Winchester's name on it. Book was in great shape tho."
1,The Author is a Moron,"Some of the author's ""tips"" were amazingly ludicrous, such as tip #329: Get a sex change operation (this is not a joke). Mr. Pond suggests that undergoing a sex change operation is a viable way to account for an allowable medical expense in order to save on income tax. Or how about tip #431: Fall in love with someone who is rich or affluent. Or maybe tip #434: Always use a condom. And how about tip #447: Never take financial responsibility for anything that eats. Clearly the author, Mr. Jonathan Pond, is a complete idiot, because he could have trimmed down the 1001 tips to one - that being the best way to save money in this miserable life is to end it. He appears to hate life, a sentiment easily grasped by the reader based on his so-called tips. I am very glad I bought this used and for less than a dollar. I will donate it to my fireplace in the coming winter, in order to save on heating expenses. That is tip #1002 and I give it to you free of charge."
2,Footstool,It broke within a year. It is the perfect size for what I want but the lid keeps breaking. This is the 3rd of 4 that has broken. I would like a footstool that doesn't have the hinge.
3,u get what you pay for,"Ok...this shoe won't win any fashion praise but it is as was expected...it appears exactly as it is on the site...I was honestly looking for an affordable work shoe...and it was...after making the purchase i started to have second thoughs about how it would look with my outfit...it turns out that i was right...there's nothing wrong with the sho its just that it didn't fit my clothes well.the insole is pretty comfy, the leather is nice looking, the instep is a bit tight but i don't think its shoe-my right foot seems to be larger than the left. All-in-all it was an Ok shoe...I would look at other designs from Florsheim though."
5,an eye opening revelation,"I'm reading this again, I had lent it out to a friend and finally got it back. In the times we're living in now, this would seem to be a reality in the not too distant future. The fact that without all the distractions of our hi-tech lifestyle, our real humanity is revealed and our real character. What would we be like in dire times? Would we hang our heads and hands waiting for the government to help us? Or would we be (with God's direction and help) be one of the leaders to get our family and others through a mire of hopeless looking obstacles? How would we fare in this test? Both books in this series are worth your time and effort to read, the first one Last light, if you love mysteries and excitement is one of the best. (I've yet to get that one back from my friend) when I do I'm re-reading it.Buying more of Terri's books? you bet!"
2,"Small, great for Women","Got the Large, my foot doesn't fit in it. My mom loves them so she wants me to order her a pair and I'm leaving one for my girlfriend to wear when she stops by. Definitely not MEN's and size 11.5 feels like 7. Box said Large so don't know what's going on."
5,Great Pans....Great Price,"My husband and I bought some T-Fal pans when we first got married and we were suspicious of the quality because the price was so cheap. But it's been a year and the pans still work GREAT. They are SOOOOOO EASY TO CLEAN and NOTHING ever gets stuck. It's great. <br /><br />And, about the metal utensils, of course you shouldn't use metal on non-stick pans. I use plastic utensils and it works fine. Of course, you can use metal, but just like any other non-stick pan, the non-stick coating will start to wear away over time. <br /><br />Anyway, the point is....these are GREAT pans and they work WONDERFUL. Why pay three times as much for a fancy designer name when you can buy these for a REASONABLE PRICE. You won't be disappointed with these pans."
1,Bad Product,I am writing this review after buying a new cookset to replace this very one. The lids to the set fell apart and so are the pans. I've only had it a year and a half! I bought it because it was T-Fal and I thought that it would be a good product. Don't waste your money!
1,5 qt Dutch Oven is [no good],I received this set of pots and pans a Christmas gift from my fiance's grandmother. The dutch oven has been used 2 times with plastic utensils but now the tephlon (spelling?) is bubbled. The finish on it hasn't flaked off yet but it has severe bubbles and cracks. The rest of the pots and pans are perfect but what is the problem with this one. I am quite disturbed by the fact that something would be ruined so quickly! ....
2,They break!,"Sound and comfort were great, unfortunately, as has been said many times before, they break extremely easily. An absolute disaster of a design on the plastic headband. I hope Bose fired the idiot that came up with it. Why they are still selling these things is beyond me - they are clearly defective. I use mine only at my desk and the headband has broken in three places now through very normal wear. Thank you Bose - that's the last product I buy of yours!!! Everyone else do yourself a favour and get another pair of well built headphones."
5,Great Halloween story,Children loved it! We enjoyed reading it and drawing/cutting out withces looking kind! It was a magical experience and we could talk about different kinds of witches!
4,A Nice Easy to Read Book for Halloween,This is a nice book for beginners readers who are interested in reading Halloween books. It's a sweet story about a little girl witch who is trying to succeed in making spells. She struggles and finally learns to fly with a broom and cast spells - Yeah!
4,Very good for the price,We really wanted running boards but it wasn't in our budget. This worked great for a very low price. It was also very easy to install.
3,cant beat the price,Good price but a little on the weak side if you a big person this step is not for you I am 165 I don't think will hold much more than me
4,LOVE our new bench. Though water does seem to get in.,"It's solid and fits the space perfectly. We love the storage. It's also light enough that it was easy for me to tote it, assembled, up our hill to our overlook without breathing hard. My only concern is that it seems to be getting water in the storage compartment and it hasn't been raining hard - just an occasional sprinkle. I would think they would have designed it to shed water without draining into the storage area (as this is an outdoor bench).Otherwise, we are very happy with the deal. The price is fair and we have a new place to sit and watch the birds fly about."
2,DUMB,REALLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SOMEONE WITH A VIDEO CAMERA MAKING A HOME MOVIE THE GIRLS LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING BORROWED FROM A PIMP
3,Cellular,"This was a good movie with a decent score. Although I appreciate movie scores, I appreciate them a great deal more when they include the songs played during the movie (e.g. Sinnermman by Nina Simone) as well. By the way, you can only buy the Miami Vice Felix Da Housecat version of Sinnerman with the whole CD for about thirteen dollars. Melania pointed out the Sinnerman Verve Remixed 2 sounds the same as song at the beginning and end of Cellular and you can get the MP3 download of it alone for less than a dollar.CA Luster"
2,Nothing really inspiring,I was disappointed that there is nothing really new or inspiring in this book. I am looking for ways to get our team excited and this won't do it.
5,2 Fall Down (The Ballad of The World Trade Center),"This is a very moving song, we can see that theis band will be at the top in no time. I've seen them several times in concert and they have one of the most diverse stage shows I've ever seen.2 Fall down is a 2 Kleenex Song, It truly makes me cry.But we cannot ever, ever, forget.... Margaret"
4,Mostly Excellent - recommend for all ccnp/ccdp candidates,"Very well written, high marks for accuracy and clarity. BGP section could use come augmentation."
4,CUTTING BOARDS ARE SUPPOSED TO SCRATCH,"that's it. if a cutting board is not showing marks from your knives, then it is DULLING YOUR KNIVES. So scratch away!"
2,Extremely disappointing,"I've used 'pretend' snow in Story Time for 3 years, this year I purchased 'Super Snow' thinking that it would be the same as the products I've used in the past.It's not...it's NOTHING like Insta Snow. Yeah you add water and it expands, but what you end up with is basically clumps of white rubber. It may look a little bit like snow, but it's not fluffy, it's not white and it doesn't get cold.I'm trying to give kids in the desert an understanding of snow. Other years I've had to take it away to get them to stop playing with it. This year they dropped the stuff and started trying to wipe it off their fingers."
4,Rare Pleasures,If you are any kind of Finn freak you must have this one. Eddies band The Makers is a nice surprise.This also led me to other material I did'nt know existed. Just misses 5 stars. Buy It!
2,items had spilled in container,the items arrived sticky and needed to be cleaned. one of the containers had leaked in transit and spilled all over the other containers.
3,Big Assortment/Small quantites,This is a nice assortment and nice products but very small quantities. There is not enough of each product to get a good idea of if you want to buy more or not.
5,Thank you Brady Rymer!!!,Brady Rymer is our favorite musician for the entire family to listen to. His childrens music is loved by my husband and myself just as much as the kids.Everyone should own at least one of his albums!
5,also guide for layman also,I come across this book two months before in GemmologicalInstitute of india at mumbai.And it is very useful to everygemmologists and as well as to every gemstone dealers and also everystudents...
2,Good Product but doesn't fit,"Don't buy this if you are looking for a replacement on a 1998 Civic HX, even if amazon says it will fit. Otherwise it looks like a quality product."
2,predictable sex filled drama,The first chapter is tolerable but the rest of this to be honest: is a mess. Its predictable and stupid. On this dvd theres even a commentary done by R-Kelly him self where hes basicly just repeating what he already sang in the song(if you can call it that). Everybody's just having sex with everybody so after a while the story becomes uneventful and predictable.
5,trapped in the closet 1-12,"awesome play i love this movie, I have the second one as well, i am looking for the rest if there are any"
4,Fascinating story of little known San Francisco History,"I confess that I live in San Francisco, and very much enjoy San Francisco history. This book was so much more interesting and entertaining than I expected. Alma Spreckels was a larger than life presence in her family, in the French art collecting world, in the development of the Legion of Honor museum and 2 other lesser known museums (one in Washington state). A really well researched history that includes quotes from interviews with one of Alma's daughters and others who knew her, as well as many letters. What a story!"
3,Big Alma is a cursory look at a great woman,"poor citations, rendered with myth, not researched very well. Little about how her fortune was won."
1,Dissapointed,The strategies and tactics in this book are ridiculous for any serious player. They could maybe work at a beginners level league. Not recommended for any intermediate or higher level tennis player.
4,I liked this movie,"I must echo being a huge Firth and O'Toole fan. I watched this film twice. The first time my mind was not on the film and I thought it was OK. After watching it more intently the second time I find this movie very good and fully of all the how fleeting is fame thoughts the movie evokes.Not a movie that is likely to catch the interest of the general public but a very good movie, well acted and gets one to thinking about all the ""things"" in our lives that we think are important and setting us apart from others."
3,Saw Palmetto Extract 320,"I was told this was a good supplement to promote a healthy bladder. I bought it because this company is well known and has a good reputation. So it's no fault to the seller but this product,did nothing for me! I used the bottle up and saw no results in it other than the loss of money spent on buying it!"
1,"Bad phone card, None of the Pins work!","This card doesn't work, none of the Pins work, I keep getting a recording that says; 'this card is in use'. Well, who's using it? It's not me, and I paid for it. :("
4,This product works great!,This item is light weight and handles like a gem. I had no problem starting the trimmer and it handled well.
1,Disappointing,Trimmer started off okay but after the third use line would not advance. No way to manually advance. Would not buy again. Save your money.
3,string trimmer,"I have had many Black & Decker products and I generally like them but this one seems to have some problems. The string often breaks inside the housing and you must stop, open it and rethread the string."
2,Inadequte for an edger,"I don't know whether it is the automatic feed or the line size, but this product is a loser when it comes to edging. I've got a very small yard, but it takes two spools to get through the edging process. Buy an trimmer/edger that uses .80 or higher line size."
2,cheap plastic,Like most B&D products they are cheap made and last no more then 2 years.Now I try to fix them myself or super glue the plastic. I also own a B&L blower that just stoped working about the same time.You get what you pay for.
1,KEEP LOOKING,"Keep looking, this is a low quility product, string binds up, low power, cuts poorly. may be one year product."
4,A Good trimmer for the price.,"I did not see a reason for buying a more expensive trimmer. It works okay but the automatic spool feed does not always work. I wind my own trimmer cord and save a lot of money on Black & Decker refills. It will also be inexpesnive to replace when it goes bad, considering using a gas-type trimmer, and having to keep it up. Then too, the electric trimmer is lighter for my wife to use."
5,Great Romance!,I loved this book. The characters Kate and Mark were great. I loved reading about them and their romance. Really great book. Suspenseful too.
2,Hypocrisy at One of its Finest,"Personally, I find any sort of book of quotations belonging to any gender, race, or religion exclusively an example of extreme hypocrisy. We as the human race are always fighting for equality, correct? Well then, why the hell would you endorse INEQUALITY by publishing books of this sort? It's just mind boggling how contradictory we are in human society."
1,Not good,"I had this unit for about 3 days, it was just OK did not notice a difference at all....It stopped working and I contacted the support center, they did not speak English very well and told be I have to pay $40.00 for shipping to get a new one that ""Might"" be refurbished.Bad unit, honorable support. I got a Honeywell IDF filter unit works great!"
2,Disappointing and convoluted!,"Joe Kelly has always been a hit or miss type of writer for me and here was a pretty big miss. While the lineup is as close to ridiculous as the JLA Detroit ever got, the plot is also all over the board. There are three different stories in this trade and two of the three make little to no sense. The art by Doug Mahnke is good and Darryl Banks has delivers. However, Duncan Rouleau, as usual is not a good fit for a superhero book. Its pretty bad when Superman is indistinguishable from Major Disaster. Overall this was a weak effort and could easily be forgotten."
4,Love California Baby,"I love the Soothing and healing spray, smells great and is very refreshing! The sunblock works great but it can be hard to rub all of it in, and if your child goes in the water to soon you may see white streaks on his or her chest. It doesn't stain. My favorite product out of this set is the Tea Tree and lavender shampoo/body wash, the tea tree in it is cooling when it touches your skin which is great for bathtime on a hot summer day or night. My son wouldn't wear the sunglasses because of the string that goes around your head to keep them on, I thought they were cute. Everything is small enough to take to a beach or keep in your purse or diaper bag! Great starter kit!!!"
3,Recycled **,"Didn't think Recycled meant not so clear, although print is still legible, I really thought these would be more transparent. Good for planet, not so great for professional portfolio, better for more casual use."
2,rips to fast,"I got these for my kid, but it keeps on ripping and so what was the point of getting these? I'm surprised because it had so many 5 star reviews, if anyone knows of stronger ones please let me know"
3,problems with the book,"Although I agree with the positive reviews from the other readers, especially on the exhaustive research, unbiased view,etc, there are some problems with the book that have not been addressed and render it below the 5 star category.1-The editing is lousy. There are dozens of unnecessary repetitions, some very large, througout the book.2-There are no maps: this is a problem since Villa fought over a significant portion of the territory of Mexico and this is not a small country.If you buy this book you should also get a map of Mexico to be able to follow the action better."
3,A overloaded bio of a great man and his history,"I found myslef trying hard to dive into Mr. Katz journey with Pancho Villa. I respectfully admire him for all of the time and effort that he put into this self masterpiece. But, the information was overwhelming and I tended to look throughly through the chapters looking for stories and not information. I expected that after reading his book, I would be able to get a tighter grip on Mr. Villa and his experiences. I was hoping to join him through his rides within Northern Mexico, but instead I found myself being taken through a scenic route."
4,Interesting tidbits,This book explores the topic of CPFR and I found the read enlightening. Many specific examples makes the read quite entertaining.Only issue is that the book is written by a long list of authors so some of the topics are re-discussed several places in the book.
3,CPFR review,"The book is a reasonable well written summary of the CPFR concept and it's evolvement from past processes and strategies. However, what I missed was a more detailed look into calculations and detailed process descriptions. In the end the book is rather an ""advertisement"" for CPFR, with lots of commentators and citations. If this topic is a complete new concept, the book makes for a decent introduction, for the practicioner it is a little ""dry"" without the looked-for details."
2,Did not enjoy,Too much screaming. Gave it away. Thought I would like her from other songs but not for me - too emotional not the pure voice I hoped to hear.
4,Paula Cole,Have been waiting for paula cole new album. This greatest hit seem not getting any attention or promotion. And where is the song Singing out my life ?
1,Exactly what makes this genre of music so annoying,"I'm sorry, but this band represents everything that is so wrong with this ""screamo"" underground-wave that's been sweeping the youth of America. The vocals are annoying because they are over-dramatic, as are the lyrics. I'm sorry, but whoever says that these lyrics are some of the darkest they've read has got to broaden their horizons. If you want dark, ambient, and amazing music, then check out Opeth. Oh, and the dual guitars are NOT innovative, interesting, or very enjoyable to listen to either. Please, if you want to hear quality dual-guitar work, check out the Amott brothers of Arch Enemy."
5,A really good ending,"The mystery element to this book is very good. I had no idea who the perp was until the minute it was revealed! Webb and Roanna make an excellent couple, and the spooky gothic atmosphere of Davencourt oozes off the pages. The Davenport/Tallant clan is dysfunctional bordering on crazy. I didn't blame Webb for fleeing!"
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy Linda Howard's books, especially because her heroines are usually smart and spunky. The female protagonist of this story, however, lacked energy and likeability. I wondered what the hero saw in her. I suppose every author is allowed a few missteps. This is definitely one of Howard's."
3,Disturbing but kept reading anyway,"There is a major yuck factor with the fact that the two main characters are second cousins. Not only that, but a father and daughter have sexual relations which result in a pregnancy! Even putting those disturbing facts aside, the characters in the book were unbelievable as anyone who would exist in real life. Roanna was said to have turned into a hardened woman with a tough outer shell who hadn't laughed in 10 years! I find that hard to believe when within two days of Webb's return, she realizes that she is a confident woman that people like and she had friends. I find that mighty hard to believe!! I don't know of any boring,stick in the mud who never laughs or smiles that actually has friends or is well liked. I am a huge Linda Howard fan, but Shades of Twilight was a miss. I guess everyone is entitled to at least one."
4,Fairly good,"Well written, intelligent. A good look into what it is that those brain surgeons actually do. I for one never knew that neurosurgeons and neurologists are a different breed altogether. And yes, the one neurologist I know does have a goatee and wears a bow tie..I gave it 4 stars since I sort of lost interest in a couple of the last chapters since it seems like she was just trying to fill up space and had really nothing more to say."
3,"Decent read, but couldn't hold attention in every page","I was introduced to this book from nytimes.com. The excerpt was for sure attention grabbing and I couldn't wait to start reading it.However, some of the writing seem to lose structure and appear more like a space filler than interesting read. It made me feel like a book of ideas puzzled together in a quick time period.I did enjoy the book but hope the author will keep her day job .. for benefit of humanity."
5,"Some receivers are missing, but you can help","Yes, this is a catalog of base receivers, 1945-now. Osterman provides many useful informations, and if it may be true that some informations may not be useful to an european reader (e.g. the 'used' prices), you wil not find a so comprehensive guide elsewhere. Another book will be dedicated to portable sw radios. Osterman is not God, so many data are provided by the readers: it's the way the informations flow in the scientific communities, why not here? If you are an european reader, and you know something Osterman does not, write him. I've done so, and a new chapter in this edition was added with the informations I retrieved."
1,I have never done this before,I picked this book up at the store and I returned it. I didn't even think it was possible to return a book. It's really a book about how to avoid actually having an opinion on a subject that directly impacts your life. It also spends more time slamming people who are actually attempting to secure the rights of gay people because they 'might' be against the administration. It is really sad. I hope the best for Mary. Maybe one day she'll come out with an opinion worth reading. Hopefully that book will be a great work of art not fiction.
1,Boring and Bitter,The only newsworthy thing in this book is how Mary Cheney comes across as boring and bitter at the same time. I was hoping for some revelations in this book and all I got was warmed-over political double talk.
1,Self-hatred run amuck,"I borrowed the book from the Young Repubs who are mounting a campaign to give it good reviews, so I have read it. It is a peculiar book especially when read about the same time I've heard several of her radio interviews. They are painful to listen to because of her convoluted attempts to defend her father's political choices. She may love her father but to try to defend his homophobia is a marvel in self-hatred."
5,Simply Green Star.,"The best book around for instructions on how to use your Green Star Juicer. The recipes in the book are oustanding, and easy to follow and to make. The author out-did herself. When you thumb through the book, you get the impression that all you need is only the Geen Star juicer and no other units for processing or making your meals. The more I follow the ideas for the recipes in the book, the more I believe this just might be true. A great book to have if you own a Green Star unit or any unit that uses dual augers to to get the full benifits of the book. An expensive book, but worth it to me."
2,Outdated techniques,"While there are some good tips in this book, I find most of the training methods to be outdated. The conventional wisdom these days is that positive reinforcement, not physical discipline, is the most effective dog training method. I would agree with today's conventional wisdom. There are many more up to date books on the subject of canine house training available today. No need to spend your money on this one."
1,This is a 3.1 Megapixel Camera with 4x Digital Zoom,"The display name of this product is quite deceptive. This camera really only has 3.1 Megapixels (2048 x1536 Pixels) that is interpolated up to 6.0. And, even if they try to call it a ""4x Smart Zoom"", it is just a digital zoom, resulting in further interpolation if you zoom in. You are *FAR* better off buying a 3 Megapixel digital camera, in the same price range, from Kodak, Canon, Olympus, Fuji, etc."
5,NIIICE,"ok some people talk about the low quality of the HD picuture on this title...well its meant to look like that, a little grainy and grimey to set the mood, but i think the way its shot gives it a beautiful picture in high definition.as for the movie i loved it also..if your into hip hop music, i would say this is a good purchase for ya...THANX AMAZON!"
3,"yo b-----s, lets put on a show!","ok, i admit that i didnt want to watch this but truth be told its a good old fashioned ""hey kids lets put on a show in the barn"" musical transferred to our times. there was nothing great here (terrence howards overhyped performance is good but far from the brilliance espoused by the likes of fatso ebert), but its all worth a peek, if you can keep the volume down and swallow your disgust at songs glorifying pimpdom."
5,You know it's hard out there for a pimp.,"Dispite my assumptions of another ""hood"" moive I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film. Yes it is gritty, yes it had some harsh language... but the performances by the actors is wonderful. Terrance Howard is once again playing a ""bad"" guy but this time we see their is a soul with in... we understand the effects of the enviroment and the things some have to do.Futhermore, the whole point of this story is that you can dream for more that what you have... you don't have to let you life as you know it now, be all there is for yourself. Who knew MTV could make a story with a moral.***********************************************I give it ""Two snaps around the world!"" Not for those easily offended by curse words... if your disdain for cursing is so strong that you can't see the larger picture this isn't a film for you."
2,Not my taste,I really like Terrence Howard. His performance in this movie to me was sub-par. I just could not get into it.
2,It's Already Insignificant,"Just this week I rewatched 1976's Taxi Driver and was struck by how ahead of its time that movie looked. In contrast, Hustle & Flow looks like a B-movie after just two years. This movie was one of those over-hyped studio babies that had so much money sunk into it that Paramount had to push it like mad via advertising. This movie was all political campaign and soft substance. The irony wasn't lost on even the jaded Hollywood community. Remember the award presenter's comment just after the soundtrack won an Oscar?"
5,NIV STUDY BIBLE - LARGE PRINT,"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Large PrintThis is an excellent study Bible. I have used it for years and just purchased this one for a friend. It is easy to use and has many wonderful features to enhance your Bible reading and study."
2,Stand for what you believe in !!!,"The character ,Tree is a 12 year old.Who is 6 feet 3 inches. He feels that he stands out of the crowd. He spends most of his time helping people. His parents are divorsed. Tree has a hard time over this. It is very hard for him to swith from house to house each week. Tree enjoys taking things apart to see what they are really made of. His granpa has to have surgey because he was hurt in the Vietnam War. His grandpa teaches Tree a lot of lessons in this book. Tree meets a new friend named Sophie,he tris to help her with being teased at school.I learned alot of lessons from reading this inspiring book. Tree is a very mature for his age. he learns to overcome his size and think of himself as regular person."
4,"No one is ever too ""tall"" to read this book!","Stand Tall (r/i)Hey reading geeks! Are you looking for a family-based book with a nice happy ""twist"" to it? Well, this is the book for you!! A boy nicknamed ""Tree"" is supposedly 6 foot 3 1/2 inches tall (still growing!!) and is only twelve years old! What is sad, though is that he just can't fit in at school OR on his basketball team, the ""Pit Bulls."" But, the lucky thing is that he runs into a new kid at his school, an unpopular eighth grade girl named Sophie Santack, who guides him through his tall life, with much advice to help him. Basically, this book got its name because Tree learns how to literally ""stand tall"" as Sophie helps him along his middle school life."
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this video thinking it was entire music videos of their songs. I was very dissappointed when they would start with a good song and video and it would be interrupted by talking from a costume designer or their manager. It was a waste of my money and I will be purchasing ABBA Gold greatest hits in hopes of getting music videos instead of interviews of managers, costume designers and fans."
5,Through Spiritual Eyes,"Through Spiritual Eyes has as many facets as a diamond, and Carole's spirit guides, Cameron and Rachelle, touch on many subjects. For anyone who has known abuse in childhood, Carole's journey offers an awe inspiring story of healing. Under the childhood yuk, we find in Carole, a woman of kindness and love, who tore off the past's unnecessary layers to bathe her soul in the Light. In so doing she was able to forgive. The healing took some inner digging to find her true self, yet the wonder of it all is that we all have that same ability. With the help of her co-author, Cheryl Long Riffle, they have created a ""sleeper"" of a book that will stay around for a long time."
5,solid watch excellent deal dirt cheap qaulity recommend highly,great watch amazon knows good quality items at an unbelievable prices Movado watch under 300 [..] yep
2,A pain to move around.,"Other than the fact that this stand holds three conga's, it is a pain in the butt. The casters are too small and with the added weight of the conga's, it is very difficult to move around. It has often tilted. For a stationary stand, it works great, but it is designed to be moved, and in that case, this item is awful..."
3,Simple Qigong Exercises for Arthritis Relief,"This DVD is more suited for beginners- clean video picture and sound.Good explanation of Qi gong and good amount of short exercises are presented.I've found so far, the YMAA videos are too long. A lot of information is redundant and makes the viewing too long before you get to the meat of the subject."
4,"very cool, but very big","i thought this ring was very cool, but when i got it, it was way too big and i can't wear it! I see now where the sizing is listed, but i would suggest putting it much higher or maybe even in the title.the ring is awesome though!"
1,Disappointed,"This item is not as it seems. I expected it to look as it is, solid coloring. However upon receipt it is not solid in color and has holes throughout the decal."
2,My Kettle has sprung a leak,This teakettle was a wedding present 5 years ago and recently the base of the kettle has sprung a leak. It boils the water but as soon as you tip it to pour out the water it starts drippling everywhere. I would not pay $80 for a teakettle that can't handle normal use.
4,boredoms brand noise trance,"This is the best of the short time CDs (That more properly should have been boxed as a set)- this one is musical and intense, with overtures to the Mekons mixed it (and you can't go wrong with that really).Some of the others of this series (i've reviewed a couple) were little more than simple rudimentary jams - sounding a great deal like kids with new found instruments powering through 3 chords and basic rock beats.But this one - is musical.I really enjoy the boredoms brand of rock/jazz/transe/oddball recorded snippets - but they sometimes are a bit forced.This one works however."
5,Eric and Steve At Their Best,"This video has excellent video and audio quality and is well directed and produced. Eric and Steve perform not only incredible Blind Faith tunes, but they also include excellent picks from their own treasure chests of past greats. If you felt that Blind Faith had a magic quality in the past, then you will be happy to see the return of this same musical magic again today."
1,A problem!,"I have a brand new bluray and I've watched a bunch of things but, this dvd does not work. I got two from amazon and both were defective. I just got my money back. I still want a working dvd."
4,Classic but not overly ambitious,"I'm a life-long Clapton fan and was thrilled to see him get back together with Steve Winwood for these shows. The musicianship is obvious and the respect and friendship these two have is genuine. The quality of the recording, in both sight and sound, is excellent. That said, I felt disappointed that they were not a bit more ambitious in the songs they chose, from their collective catalogue and their individual careers. I didn't see the type of improvisation and risk taking for which I had hoped. It's a fine documentation of these two great artists, and for fans like me it's a must-have. However, in the end I felt they could have challenged themselves more."
5,Great Concert.,I love Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood's music. This CD was new and the priced reasonable. It arrived quickly. I will do business with the vendor again.
2,Shameful Audio - Ruins the Concert BluRay,"Trust an owner of 100+ music concert DVDs and Blurays...this one is ruined by incredibly poor AUDIO.The video is fine. The audio is a distorted mess. It isn't my system. I listen to all kinds of music and mostly hi-rez audio either in the form of SACD, DVD-A, or high definition 24-bit/96kHz or higher files. I have a great appreciation for sound.Something went very wrong during the recording or mastering. They either used too much compression (which creates terrible distorsion)or the gain was wrong. Either way it is most noticeable on vocals...although in general the Bluray sounds harsh even at low volumes. My kids even commented.So strike 1 - it is a Bluray without uncompressed audio as a sound choice (only DTS and PCM low rez)Strike 2,3,4 - the sound is compressed and distorted unlike any other DVD or Bluray I've ever heard.Such a shame. Otherwise it could have been a very nice concert Bluray."
3,decent product,this product is a decent quality. it has plastic barrel. also the building of this pump is not that great but it is good for simple use...
1,Piece of Garbage,"The metal attached to the foot pad bent on the first pump. The metal is weak, spend your money on another pump."
1,You get what you pay for,Negatives:* Lever arm has a tendency to shift to the sides as you are using it.* Metal hook that holds the lever arm down for storage points straight up while in use just waiting for an unlucky foot to come down and impale itself on it. This is made all the more likely by the previous point.* Base of the unit doesn't sit level even when there is no stress being applied to it.* All adapter nozzles are plastic.* The star-shaped plastic head inside the nozzle that is supposed to depress the tip in your tire stem ends up getting stripped by the pin instead. Eventually it would not depress the pin at all and I was unable to inflate my tire.* I tried several searches online trying to locate the manufacturer website for ordering a replacement head and could find nothing.Positives:* It is easy to use when it is functional.
1,Don't waste your money,Rated one star because I couldn't give it a zero. Bent the first time I tired to use it. Useless junk.
1,order cancelled,"I was looking forward to receiving this bag, but no-my order was cancelled ""per my request."" I merely asked if my order was going to be processed as it has been over 11days since i placed the order and it was in stock when i ordered it. They read that as ""please cancel my order"" so now i have to find another vendor who has this bag and wait another 2 weeks before i even get it! horrible service, horrible shipping, I will never order from this vendor ever again!"
5,Wow...,"I just finished reading _Other Nature_ about thirty minutes ago. I'm still in a bit of shock. It's that good.Stephanie A. Smith is relative rarity in the Science Fiction genre, an author who doesn't insult your intelligence. You don't catch the rich subtleties, tough. She isn't going to shove your nose in it until you realize what she is trying to say.The story, unlike so many science-fiction stories, doesn't depend on a nifty little idea. It's about people, and a small town.This novel will probably be rejected by many, which is a shame. If more science fiction was like this, I would read it a lot more."
2,ok,"the band has a nice acoustic sound. The first track isnt all that great, but I admit it gets better. If Natalies voice was better I'd actually purchase the album. She sounds like a sad lamb singing."
1,Wok Set,"The dishes were nice, but everything seemed ""cheap"". I returned the item because it was not what I was expecting!"
3,Interesting read,Bought this book because I love tigers and the thought of maneating tigers that are not killed is fascinating. Overall much of the book was good although it got a bit too much into religious beliefs and philosophy for my taste.
5,And the Magic returns....,"When Beauty and the Beast first came out all those years ago, I was going thru an extremely rough period in my life. It became a true to life story for me with the pitfalls and the romance of the characters mirroring some of my own life. I was enchanted and spirited by Catherine, Vincent, Father, Mouse and the others, each with their own plots, concerns, hurts and loves. I was crushed as many were, when the story came to an end. And although I taped the series, I wrote and wished for a professional copy to surface for my collection to be a great one. Now I find, that it has not only been produced for the consumer to purchase, but once again, it arrives at another rough period in my life, to help heal me once again. Only this time, I get to have a perfect copy of a wonderfully, feel good, make you laugh or make you cry of this beautiful show. Thank you so very much for releasing it after all these years."
5,Where is the 3rd/Final Season???,"Loved the series at the time and totally enjoying the DVD's. Just finished Season #2 - Vincent is down in the catacombs, Catherine followed him down.... Shreaking & wailing... Where is the final set???"
5,yep its THAT one,wvell for any DND er out there its a realy good thuing (long as yoru old enough).the 'new' magic items are great!
2,Not worth the money,"Here's the thing - The book is written ""cutely"", and with kids in mind...HOWEVER, a child in the home should NEVER be the primary dog trainer. It should NEVER teach the dog or puppy, that it (the CHILD) is the ALPHA, or pack leader. This role should always be assumed by an adult.While the premise is good, there are just too many things that are either flat out wrong, or unsafe for a child to be taking on. If you are looking for a good book for your kids to learn about dogs, this may help, but it is not what I was looking for."
5,As good as it gets!,"This product has been around for years and for good reason; it's reasonable, simple to use, and it works. I have been a fan of Just for Men for some time and will continue to use thier product. It took me a while to find the right color, but I've got it now (always go a shade lighter than your hair color.) Thanks for a great product!"
5,Tells Exactly What Muscles Are Worked!!!,"If you want to maximize a single muscle or muscle group this book will pinpoint it with very nice graphics. Aaberg stresses form as do all pros. If you are lacking technical terminology and want a well organized, easy to study book with suberb drawings and photos, get this one. If you don't know the info in this book, you probably don't that much about body building. Chapters 2,3 and 4 will allow you to learn the proper vocabulary of motion and physiology in a graphic manner. This is a very nice book to suppliment your workout programs."
1,Stand Clear of Magnavox / Phillips,"I unfortunately join the others with reviews in announcing that today my screen went black, only audio remains. Bogus that Magnavox / Phillips doesn't stand behind this product given the same recurring problem with this model. I sure won't buy another product from them. Suggest you stand clear of them and SPREAD THE WORD!"
1,Could not install -,I am sure the parts are okay but I could not remove the outer sleeve of the stem from the existing faucet. The instructions that came with the faucet were useless and I could not find any additional information on-line. I now have a right and left hand stem assembly that are paper weights. I blame Price Pfister for a poor design.
5,high quality,"""Rich and moisturizing"", smell sooooo good. after i tried it, i ordered more aubrey's soaps, just can't wait to try all of their soaps.:P"
5,I laughed till I cried !,"Gary Larson's homour is unique and incredibly funny - and this is true for all his books that I've read so far! I already start laughing when looking at the cartoon characters - they are wonderfully drawn! If cows or chickens are your favourite animals and you like grotesque situations, or you simply want to laugh, then Gary Larson should be your first choice. He's the best!!!!!"
4,"Excellent find - great price, too.","Haven't watched it yet, but item came as described - on time, reasonably priced. My wife will be very excited when she opens it up on Christmas morning."
4,Fabulous!,This is the first book I have read by Rochelle Alers. I enjoyed the poetic images & vivid descriptions of the lovemaking scenes.I was very impressed with the beautiful images of landscape & appreciation for exquisite interior decor. I was fascinated with the blending of African/American /Latino cultures & language. I felt like I was on location with the characters. It took me on a new and exciting adventure. Thank you Rochelle Alers! I'm looking forward to reading more of your books.
3,Replacement tabs for lids???,"Does anyone know where I can get more of the tabs (or the entire lids with tabs) for the glass bowls? Someone we've managed to lose all of the tabs, making the bowls/lids useless for storage."
1,Difficult to Use,I bought three small ones of these for leftovers. I've already thrown one out. I can't get the tops off and I have no problems with my hands. Not recommended.
4,Much better than plastic,"After fighting with plastic lids and containers that are mismatched and thrown helter skelter into a drawer, we bought these after our kitchen was remodeled. Very pleased; you can see what is leftover; you can pop them in the microwave or oven without rearranging the food. I wish they fit together in stacks just a little bit better, but they are not bad."
5,Excellent Introduction to .NET,"A supurb introduction to .NET. Informative and enjoyable to read. Furthermore, in a tremendous burst of mental and physical agility, I was able to actually *open* the book in the store and observe that it doesn't have a lot of code examples (see previous ""review""). It does however have a wealth of useful information, introducing the basics of both .NET, and Visual Basic .NET."
3,Classical Killer,"Pretty good album, but mostly a rehash of his early titles. The best song on the album is his cover of the Big Bopper hit Chantilly Lace. This shows how Jerry Lee could take almost any song, add his unique touch, and produce a great sound. Unfortunatly, he made this song while he was banished so it went nowhere. It deserves a listen."
1,Rip-Off,"I probably assumed that the spoon rest was made of ceramic. I men with a name like ""Pfaltzgraff Yorktowne"" who would think it was made of cheap plastic. Plain ol' every day cheap plastic. It would cost $2 or less at the dollar store. A rip off."
1,If I could give this 0 Stars I would!!!!! Worst Romance I have read!,Oh where oh where as Cheryl Holt's talent gone? The last several books have been so lackluster but this one by far is the worst I have read! I agree with the other reviewer who said this book was the worst read of 2005. I disagree with the reviewer who said the cover was the only good thing - this cover doesn't even look like it belongs to a regency historical but a cowboy contemporary.I don't want to bore everyone with the details of the book just that the characters were all a bunch of idiots - not one was likeable.I can't even believe that I finished this ridiculous book. Cheryl has been taken off my must buy list and now on my purchase with caution list.
2,2 and a 1/2 stars,"In her latest Regency historical, Cheryl Holt goes for the governess turned mistress theme. Harriet Klausner already summarized the book (even adding a spoiler), so I will tell you what I thought of it.The heroine, Emily was an obnoxious would-be governess hired by and the hero (and of course rake), Michael for his new wards.I felt no love at all between the two. There was virtually no sexual tension or chemistry. Nothing to keep you up all night till you finish. I felt the subplots with Pamela were superfulous and added just to make the book longer. I found myself skimming through because I already knew the conclusion. And I'm no mystery reader.It was a very predictable read. What saved it from being a complete dud was the hot sex scenes for which CH is known for.If you are just experimenting with CH's work, try ""Love Lessons"" instead."
1,Impractical design,"I am so frustrated with these spoons/spatulas. They are poorly designed because they are very heavy on the handle end. This leads to the spoon or spatula flipping out of whatever pot or pan you rest it on/in. I have had so many incidents where the food/sauce had been splattered all over me and my kitchen. If you are going to use these products more than twice a year, then don't buy this style. You will be as frustrated as I am. (I just got a stain on my shirt from this exact sort of incident, and this isn't the first item of clothing I've ruined as a result of this product.)"
2,Different,Not one of my favorites by Linda Howard. The male character seemed to cruel and demanded too much inappropriate sex. It did have a good ending.
1,more reluctant than ever,I purchased this book with the hope it would to give me the courage to finally have bilateral knee replacments. It was extremely upsetting and I thought very negative in comparison to all the research Ive done and all the persons I asked about their experiences with knee replacments. I really wish I had not read it. I passed it on to some people with first hand experience with the procedure and so far they all heartily agree it wasnt that drastic in their opinion. I realize its no day at the beach( as Ive been told )but it cant be as drastic as all that.
3,Badly Written,"It is missing 2 pages and some of the words are not spelled correctly, I don't know if it is the editors, publishers or whose fault. Makes you wonder if it is the original."
2,Not impressed,"I had to call the company to have a lid replace because it didn't fit right. They were good about sending me another out but then I ran into trouble with the bowl after using it, it cracked in four different places."
1,Corningware is now Stoneware,Unfortunately the beautiful durable glass-ceramic that we all came to love is no longer. The trademark Corningware is now used on Stoneware made outside the USA (Thailand etc.). The Corningware currently being marketed can not be used under the broiler or on the stove top. The broken shipments reported here should indicate what can be expected of this product during use. This is a very sad day for life long fans of real Corningware!
3,"A rainy day, the cable's out, what should I watch . . .","Although this action/adventure film is a bit cliché, I enjoyed the characters and their interraction with each other. A pleasant hero (John Allen Nelson), his potential girlfriend and an overly-exuberant bunch of Greek homeboys (including her husband!) all tangle with each other and telegraph their next move to you, the bemused viewer. It was fun . . . and the ending, albeit implausible, made me smile."
4,Great song book!,This song book has made me feel good because I can play most of it. Double Trouble is fun to play because it also has the lyrics that you can sing with it. Hedwig's Theme is in there with more rhythm and they have Buckbeak's Flight which in my opinion is the best song in this book.
5,Birthday,"This was a birthday presnet for me from my Sister and Brother in law. I wear it everyday and love the ring. It replaes a piece of costune jewelry I broke a year ago. Wonderful piece of jewelry, I adore it."
2,A complete waste of time like the other c.d.'s in the series,"Buying a 12-song ""Best of Hank Williams"" c.d. is as pointless as buying one on Frank Sinatra or The Beatles. It's like eating a small bite of a sandwich and being satisfied that you ate the entire sandwich.Williams was one of the giants of 20th Century popular music and the greatest of all country singers. Even the out-of-print ""40 Greatest Hits"" double set doesn't do him justice. Go ahead and buy the ""Complete Hank Williams."" Hank's WORTH it! Besides, prices are firming up on the set, it won't always be available, and you can pass it down to your descendents."
5,The Ultimate Programming Starter Asset,"For all those people that wonder how computer applications work, and how those big companies actually create them, this will solve your endevours. Throught comprehensive and reader-friendly writing, Dave Mark delivers the most complete basics for easy Macintosh programming available. The book/CD-Rom package contains all the needed material and information to begin creating your own Macintosh platform applications.Even better, since the C language core is the same thing on all major computer platforms, learning this language will give you a competitive edge on UNIX, DOS, and other computer platforms.If you have no idea what programming is, wan't to know how to ultimately utilize your computer's abilities, and like a good laugh, buy this book!"
4,"Great no-thrills text, easy to read.","This text is not full of fillers such as over done photos, graphs, homework questions, etc. I appreciate that I can hold this book in one hand and read it like a novel. It's well written and put together. It does contain essential maps and other graphics but they are again - the essential ones."
1,AT&T is evil,"I used Cingular/AT&T for a year and a half. Reception was okay, but the customer service was terrible. They do not care about their customers, but are entirely focused on their bottom line. This is not the type of company I would choose to deal with. I'll spare you the gory details and simply recommend you choose someone else."
3,Good Content but a lot of fluf,"For the most part this book is very through on teaching you Access, however there is a lot of fluf in some of the instructions it walks you through. For example, everytime it walks you through steps on going to the properties screen of any object it will tell you step by step how to right click, how to scroll down to the properties and then left click on 'properties'. Anyone who needs this level of detail should probably be reading a 'Windows for dummies' book instead.The actual content of the book has so far been fairly thorough as far as understanding Access. The information regarding database design is more or less satisfactory for getting you started working with access, but for a complete understanding of databases in general it leaves a bit to be desired.For the Access content of the book I give it a 4/5 but looking at the book as a whole i have to take a whole point away because of the volumes of fluf i have to sift through to get to the meat and potatoes."
3,Not too bad - not too good,"This ""Bible"" is both comprehensive and disappointing. It seems the authors were unable to reach an agreement upon the audience the book is written for. While suffering here and there from unnecessary repetitions, it is afflicted at other places by ""jumps and gaps"".In the authors' own words, the book is written for ""beginning, intermediate and even advanced users of Microsoft Access 2003"". In my opinion, a much accurate definition would be restricted to the intermediate level. Database maintaining can't be expected to be a trivial matter, neither should the first experiences be made excessively demanding.As a whole, this book does not stand by the standards of John Walkenbach's ""Excel Bible"" in the same series."
4,Good for intermediate users.,"Considering that it's only one volume, this book is about as comprehensive as you can get. Good instruction, great index, and an excellent accompanying cd with exercises and additional information. The book itself could have been more concise, though. At times it's repetative and redundant, but for no other reason than to clarify the author's methodolgy behind the current lesson. Being an intermediate user, this was a great book; however, if you consider yourself advanced, I'd skip this and try to find something more specific. This isn't really a great book for beginners either; you'd probably find it a bit overwhelming and the terminology a bit confusing. Regardless, it's a great reference tool for any user, and I recommend it."
2,Not worth the price,"Extremely long book, but requires an in-depth knowledge of the software. Definitely not for beginners nor intermediate users. Not practical nor real world."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"This book is a bit of a disappointment. I have the ""Excel Bible"" from the same publisher, which is quite good, and I expected something similar.What I understand for a software ""bible"" is a reference book which offers many direct and quick suggestions on how to use the software functionalities and solve common problems. I would also expect this book to be easy to use irrespective of which chapter or section you browse through. What I actually got is some sort of a ""course"" that only makes sense if the reader follows the chapters in order. Plus it is expected that the reader becomes familiar with the example files available in the attached CD.In summary, this book is not easy to use."
5,Microsoft Office Access 2003 Bible,I have been using the Access 2003 Bible and I am impressed. I have other copies of this author's publications and find them very well documented.And the price of the book was incredible. Thank you Amazon.Mike H.Access 2003 Bible
1,Trash,"As I was filling the carrier up I discovered that the product arrived with two neatly punctured holes on it near the top, which rendered the thing totally worthless. Couldn't pour without making a wet mess. As the holes were very neatly and symmetrically placed, I could not tell if they were put there on purpose for air flow or if I just received a defective product. In the rush of packing up our campsite, I couldn't be bothered to bring it back to return it so it ended up in the trash. Worst $10 I ever spent."
3,i didn't think it was too informative.,"I think that this book was well written but it lacked information on modern filtration systems and was generally too far back in the past to be an outstanding reference. This is the only flaw i found in the book, otherwise it is a fairly good pick!"
5,Goal Setting!,"I am a school counselor and have used this book in teaching Goal Setting and Decision Making skills. My school was hit by a tornado three years ago and I have been unable to find this book. My students loved it, it was very motivating. Please reprint at a reasonable cost! I need it for classroom guidance!"
5,I Can't Accept This Book Being Out of Print,"I bought this book back in 1994. It was very inspirational for me. Somewhere along the line I felt it would help inspire my cousin so I let her borrow it. I never received it back and she isn't sure where it is now. My next door neighbor could use some inspiration now, but I no longer have access to the valuable information this book possesses. I truly wish this book would be re-printed once again. I enjoyed it very much and I would like to own it again! It was very inspirational and made me begin thinking positively and working hard to accomplish my goals."
5,Steve Winwood,Would have loved to have had Arc of a Diver on this and it would have been 5 1/2 stars. Good stuff though.
5,living legend,"I saw him live with Eric Clapton and it was @ the best top five concerts I've seen. I've seen the Stones, Paul McCartney, etc. I recieved it fast and in great shape."
4,Princess booster seat,Easy to use. My daughter was excited to graduate from the car seat and loves the princess fabric. The little cup holders were a hit as well.
4,CHICO,"Yo, listen up. If y'all like prince, then you gone wanna cop this album fa sure. He has sorta of light-voiced singing especially on that ""give you what u want"" cut. so if you down with the artist, get down with mr. debarge."
5,"In, Chico's ""Game"", he obviously plays to win.","Chico has almost outdone ""Long Time No See"", and to do that takes hard work. You can tell the difference between the two albums, but Chico definitely makes up for it with the material he has on ""The Game"". ""Listen To Your Man"", with another good assist by JOE, tells his woman to do just that and not pay attention to all the unnecessary ""gossip"" and advice from ""so-called"" friends. ""Everybody Knew But Me"" is about a woman that he was involved with who up an left without saying a word. ""When Will I See You Again"" is probably the best song on the CD. The sophomore jinx is for some r&b and rap artists, but it's obvious that Chico is not going to fall victim to it."
5,"This CD is a perfect follow-up to ""Long Time No See.""","I love this CD and every song on it is good, but my favorite one is ""Your Way."" This song is too smooth! ""Sexual"" could get some folks in trouble. This song takes Atlantic Starr's ""Secret Lovers"" much further! If you heard it, then you know what I'm talking about. ""Heart, Mind & Soul"" with Ms. Etterlene(Mama DeBarge)is a beautiful remake of El's original song. You can also hear El in the background. I recommend that this CD be added to any music lover's collection who's into REAL soul music."
3,Legal study,"This book makes the judicial/military court system look very bad. Hopefully we have learned to react with logic and follow the law and not railroad someone to try to make right a wrong. This is written in a style of the early 20th century and is not an easy read, but sure does open ones eyes to how there can be a true miscarriage of justice."
5,A Book for Anyone with a Soul,"I read this book just as I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. The book helped me focus my energy not on ""Why me?"" but on ""What can I learn from this experience?"" It has enabled me to focus on the relationships in my life (my family, my friends, God), rather than the fact that the illness I have could mean my death in a few years. Dr. Guindon's book made me much less afraid of death, if indeed that is my near-term fate. I recommend this book to everyone, but especially to those facing a terminal or long-term illness, and their friends and family."
5,Great Hitch,The Curt Hitch Ball arrived on time and intact. Installed in under 5 minutes in my driveway. We are very satisfied
5,Can't help but be amazed with June and GLoria,"Really love this movie. SHame that Miss Dehaven was not in more pictures. SHe is one very tallented actress who has beauty, style, class and proved that even in the movie ""Out to Sea"", still has all these things and CAN STILL DANCE with the best of them. SHe really has a wonderful singing voice. Most of all...........even at this stage of her life (80 yr. old) she is just as beautiful and LOOK AT THOSE EYES and THAT SMILE!!!! It is nice to know that Miss Dehaven, Miss Allyson and Mr. Johnson have remianed friend for years."
4,Safe and secure comes with its drawbacks,"I recently bought this for my Macbook Pro, and let me just say it's huge and heavy. However, my Macbook Pro is very secure and seems near invincible in it. It has more pockets and zippers than I knew what to do with, but now I've filled them all out nicely and have room for everything. I usually care some work books, my power adapter, 360 controller, and all kinds of stuff.Overall, I'm very satisfied in its build quality, I just wasn't expecting it to be so bulky."
4,Trailer ball of the gods . . .,"Right size for my application. It's shiny. Good price. Arrived rapidly. Not a lot more praise can be heaped on a piece of formed steel. If I needed a second 1-7/8 inch ball, this would be a fine option."
3,"It's Ok - If you're towing a Uhaul, Get the 2 Inch","I didn't realize there would be such a difference between the 1-7/8 and the 2 inch trailer ball but Boy, is there...After driving home with the trailer attached, we decided to go ahead and get the 2. It really does make a difference and the trailer didn't clang like it had been."
2,TOO CATHOLIC,"We have many of the Wiggles DVD's and videos and were really disapointed with this DVD. There is the usual Wiggle stuff and child directed humor, but we were suprised at the amount of religious content towards the Virgin Mary. Too much for comfort.We understand that this is a religious time, but spend more time on Santa rather than poor quality pictures and video of the Virgin Mary that deserve a more appropriate forum.Don't get me wrong, we go to church regularly, this just seemed too much.Sorry Wiggles but this was a FLOP!"
4,"Yes, they are goofy, but kids love it!","This is one of the many Wiggles videos that we own, and it's become a favorite in our house. The songs are much more advanced, with many levels of vocals and instruments. The addition of the Wiggly dancers (also in other more recent videos) just adds another dimension.In response to those who say it's corny, or too goofy my response would be this. It's not for adults, it's for kids!!!!! That's their goal, to entertain children!!!! My three year old daughter loves the Wiggles, and it's not unusual for her to memorize the songs and dances, and participate along with the video. And if she's happy, I'm happy.I do question why Barry Williams is in this video, but for the most part, my daughter doesn't even acknowledge his presence. Her only complaint (and it's a mild one) is that Dorothy, Wags and Henry aren't in it as much. But she still loves it!"
5,Madeline - Always good,"Seeing the children run amok in a toy store, Miss Clavell decides to take them to a toy factory. The ever-energetic Madeline falls onto a conveyor belt, and is boxed up as a doll. Thinking that this will be great fun, Madeline plays the part, and is purchased for a sickly little girl named Gizelle. Gizelle has no friends of her own, and feels quite bad when Miss Clavell arrives to take Madeline home. Madeline comes to the rescue, but organizing an outing for all of Miss Clavell's girls to Gizelle's house, where they make her part of the group.I loved this movie for several reasons. First of all, this movie has the same quality of all the Madeline cartoons. Secondly, I loved the lesson that it taught. This is an excellent movie."
5,Good book for setting morning and night routine,"My son is 19 months old and I have been reading him this book ever since he was 3 months old. When he awakes; first thing in the morning we read ""Wake Up"". I usually exaggerate the part in the book where ""trees are singing, birds are winging, THINGS ARE THINGING!!"" He looks forward to that part and bursts out laughing each time. At night, before going to bed, we read ""Good Night"". I usually read it in quiet tones and it sets the mood for settling down for the evening. Both stories are short and cater to the short attention span of little ones. I highly recommend it (them?)"
2,Overrated,"Where's the heart? Where's the soul? Where's the swing?Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, or even Eva Cassidy are excellent examples of the power of female jazz vocals; Jacintha and Diana Krall are excellent examples of hyped-up marketing with no jazz sensibilities.By the way, the photo appears to show the XRCD version of this disc; the one actually being sold is the much-inferior standard CD. But even the sound of vinyl can't replace soul...."
3,Pretty interesting...!,"It has got cool new sounds and the words have diferent meanings for everybody, good buy!!"
4,A Must-Have for Fans,"This two-CD boxed set from Concord Jazz breaks its content cleanly between the two disks, the first CD containing historical recordings that the producers have obtained by permission from other sources, while the second disk contains songs that Ms. Clooney recorded for Concord from 1977 through 1998 (plus one cut taken from a Warner Bros. soundtrack). Except perhaps to die-hard Clooney completists, the first disk is not of much interest except as a curiosity, but the second is quite satisfying as an overview of a mature jazz singer with considerable musical gifts. The enclosed booklet gives a brief overview of Ms. Clooney's long career, and there are photos from various stages of her life. Concord Records has always paid good attention to sound quality, and the sound on the second disk is exemplary in terms of range and balance. For fans of mainstream jazz vocals, this set will be a must-have."
4,worked fine,the DVD was fine and in the condition it claimed to be. however my mom thought the jacket was the plastic wrap and ripped it accidentally..so don't be fooled by the shiny plastic !
2,What a horrible movie,"If you're interested in cheesy effects for the sake of comedy, this is for you. I've heard this film has been compared to Evil Dead II. But I hardly find any relations with that movie with this one. Just to the fact that you may feel disturbed by the human eating piano, the bed sheets that kill, etc. This ISN'T a horror film! This is a bizarre film. If you like Asian horror then this probably isn't for you. But if you like really messed up movies then this is definitley something new to explore."
2,Great concept. Execution drags along.,"""Hausu"" seems to try combining two 70s trends (the zany live-action Saturday morning show and the Supernatural Horror movie) with some schoolgirls fetishism. You'd think that would be a winning lunatic combination, but the movie gets the pacing wrong and drags along much of the time."
4,A Japanese Take on MANOS - The Hands of Fate,"This thing plays out like a Japanese-inspired version of the MST3K-spoofed MANOS - The Hands of Fate, but with bouncy teenage girls and a sense of humor about itself. This movie actually BORROWS from MANOS. From the cat painting on the wall to the watermelon salesman's line ""The lady will be pleased!"", MSTies will find themselves making a LOT of comparisons.Definitely a 'bad, yet fun' title. I can't believe Criterion took this on. I can't believe MST3K DIDN'T take this on."
4,Baby Pirate Costume Review-why do I need a title :P,The costume was adorable and even though it was a bit big it still worked. (my fault for ordering a 6-12 month costume for a 4.5 monther. The only thing is the material isn't very strong as by the end of the night there was already a thread bunch pucker but it isn't to noticeable.
3,"Yeah, it works, but it is a piece of crap !","I bought this bike pump and strapped it up to my schwinn, and headed out to a 3 mile mountain. about half way there, I noticed my front tire was a little low, so I thought what a great oppertunity to use my new pump. WRONG ! I could not get it to stay on the stem for the life of me ! I ended up letting out all of the air that was left in the tire ! I tried and tried, and finally after a 1/2 hour, I got the damn thing to work. Yeah, sure it works, but hopefully you will never have to use it."
1,INSANELY IDIOTIC,"I have never in my life experienced such an inept Bike pump. At no point did this pump form anything that could be considered a seal around the stem of my new tire. The tire was also a Bell of the Presta Valve variety. This pump was never able to put even a single PSI of air into the tire and instead just shoots air all over the person who is trying to use this crappy, horrible pump. I award this no points, and my god have mercy on their soul."
1,Do not buy,"This pump absolutely, positively does not work on presta valves. Maybe it works on schrader, I do not have any bikes with schrader valves. Horrible piece of junk and just found its place in the garbage."
1,Not impressed,"Well, here I am, first week in a new country, so I buy a bicycle so as to be able to get around, and being good with all that forward planning stuff, I buy this pump. And having been at it for an hour, following both the instructions on the packaging, and those given in the review above (which do NOT appear on the packaging in any form, sorry) have had to give up. A bicycle pump a) should work and b) has never before in my considerable experience of cycling required instructions. I am knackered and my tyres remain flat as pancakes. Had this pump been marketed as one that doesn't really work, I would perhaps have been armed with the information that would have prompted me to buy one that does. Deeply unimpressed."
2,Cassidy's recent album is only a half-cooked effort!,"I'm not used to his new style of music. It seems that alot of old groups from the 60's and 70's try to do a new wave of music. Cher's new album is this style as well, but hers is much better! He's remastering alot of his early tracks from ""The Partridge Family"" years and other tunes that were never released or even recorded.I like his new version of ""I Think I Love You."" I also like ""You Were the One"" and ""Let Her Go"", so this isn't such a bad album, just not the best. He's doing well I must say.He made a success in starring in the Broadway tour of ""Blood Brothers"" with Petula Clarke and his younger half-brother Shaun, and did a 2 year performance in a theatre in Las Vegas called ""EFX"" and now has a new contract with a new musical production."
4,Different,"It is not the partridge family. If you are buying it expecting the oldies but goodies, this cd is not for you. I loved the old stuff too, but this is new. You would have to break the old David ""Keith"" mold to enjoy this music. But I enjoy it and think it is very well done."
2,Won't work in my classroom,"I was hoping to use this with my junior English classes as a follow-up to reading the story. I expected it to be campy but fun. Unfortunately, it's just too weird and boring, frankly. It doesn't follow the original story at all, which would be okay if I thought my students would still enjoy it, but there's no way. Too bad."
1,Butchered and beleagured,"Poor for teaching or watching for entertainment. Changes the plot line: the narrator visitor comes to see Roderick, not Madeline. She couldn't leave the house because she has catalypsy and is dying, like Roderick, and the house, i.e. the entire ""House"" of Usher. Story is tormented by exaggeration and slow, redundant ""action."" Encyclopedia Brittanica has a better version and I thought this would be! Not."
3,Terrific collection of articles in its day,"This book was published in 1970 and was a good co0llection of essays at the time, representing a ""state of the art"" look at aggression among animals. There are a variety of subjects covered here, with individual essays written by leading figures of the time, such as Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, K. R. L. Hall, Nicholas Collias, Benson Ginsberg, and Charles Southwick himself.Among subjects covered: the evolution of aggression, the survival value of aggressive behavior, aggression in a variety of species (e.g., insects, mice and rats, monkeys and apes), physiological factors in aggression, the brain and aggression, brain biochemistry and aggression, genes and the development of behavior, and the like.It is now dated, but this stands as a wonderful picture of the state of knowledge at the time that this book was published."
3,Textbook for class,"This is a decent textbook for any political science or law class that is teaching the fundamentals on the legal process and judicial procedures. However, if I wasn't in school, then I wouldn't be reading this book."
5,Worked for us,"This book was given to us as a gift from a family that was raising their children under similar religious beliefs as ours. I read the book from cover to cover and absorbed all that it had to say. I pondered on whether the discipline would work before applying it. Boy did it. We did not have many problems out of our children since. There was a sense of control in the home, we are always complimented on or childrens behavior out in public (and we have 9 children). Consistency is the key."
1,Please Don't Buy This Book!! Advocates Child Abuse!!,"The Pearl's belief that whipping innocent babies will cause them to behave is CHILD ABUSE!!Reading excerpts from this book brought tears to my eyes. What decent human being would take a wooden paddle and beat a child on the back of their legs because they won't stop crying? The description of an infant being beaten until it ""whimpered in submission"" made me cry. All this book does is advocate child abuse in the name of discipline.Too bad there isn't a ""no star"" rating. This book should not be on Amazon!"
1,Child Abuse Handbook,"This book advocates not only vile abuse and neglet of children, but animals as well. It is heartbreaking. It is the abuser's instruction manual. How frightening to think that the children of these types of homes will be future members of society (should they survive childhood).How terribly sad. New parents, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I gave it one star because at least one was required."
1,HOW ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"That these types of books are allowed to be publised makes me sick, not to mention how sick I feel knowing that there are people out there actually treating children the ways intended in this book. These are babies, they have no concept of right from wrong and beating in into them is beyond wrong. I wouldn't treat a rodent the way that these people are suggesting to treat children. Please realize that babies need LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, NOT beatings. Anyone even considering these methods should be checked by social services."
5,What a BIG HELP,"I own all these book and they have ben such a great help to my parenting. All the questions I have, what to do , what happens when, what do I do when etc. All biblical, enjoyed VERY much. Have given to SEVERAL friends and have loved it as well. Kids are such a JOY! Thank you Pearls :-)"
4,Best Male Vocalist!,"Gary Allan has the best control of his vocal instrument that I've heard in a long while. This collection is haunting in a way I haven't heard since Alan Jackson's ""Midnight in Montgomery"", and like Jackson, Allen can't be accused of selling out to pop music. I didn't like the contrived endings to a couple of the tracks and I'm primarily a blues fan, but couldn't resist the amazing title track on this album, and was glad I gave in...it's excellent!"
5,"Great songs, great cast! You won't be disapointed","Howard Keel, Ann Blyth and Sebastien Cabot are wonderful in this version of ""Kismet."" Delores Gray is simply magnificent as the sultry Lalume, and I just loved Vic Damone's lovestruck Caliph. The dialogue is witty and quite ahead of its time. Songs like ""Stranger in Paradise,"" ""Night of My Nights"" and ""Not Since Nineveh"" are unforgettable. The costumes and sets, though not historically accurate, are lovely - the lavish wedding procession remains one of my favorite film scenes."
4,MGM's FInest!,"Reviews...reviews....what's in a review ? My unprofessional opinion may not count as well as the super paid pros, but each knows what makes him/her FEEL GOOD ! And this MGM lavish musical does make the grade.Howard Keel is as usual, his vibrant self and carries out some of the lesser known tunes quite appealingly. Both Ann Blyth - luscious and Delores Gray - superb. But my ""right for casting"" hit ( despite a few critics ) goes to Vic Damone. He portrays the sober young Caliph with more insight and sex appeal than most (including himself) give him credit. Bravo Damone! ""This is My Beloved"" and ""Stranger in Paradise"" rate MGM it's flair for musical film. But his ""Night of My Nights"" - bedazzling. You've won my Mesopotamian HEART!"
1,ok movie,some parts are so dumb i felt like a schmuck for buying it but then some parts where really funny. i would not watch this movie again.
3,"Occasional Humor, But Lacks a Consistently Funny Plot","There are some moments in the movie I found absolutely hilarious. However, the main plot failed to keep me engaged, and wasn't that funny in itself. Although this movie succeeded in making me laugh throughout the movie, it was not constantly entertaining"
1,What a waste of time and money,"Loved the actors in this film (which was why I rented it) but that was it. It was a total waste of time and rental fee. A embarrassment for the screenwriter and the director. ""Come on"" Hollywood I know you can do better than this!"
1,A Perfect Way to Squander Precious Time!,"If you happen to make the tragic mistake of watching this cinematic sleeping pill with a friend, don't be surprised if you find yourselves continually looking over at one another with raised eyebrows, in jaundiced disblief.Was DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS worth the approximately three minutes of admittedly ripsnorting laughs featured (AT LAST!...AT LAST!) toward the end of this otherwise dreary film -- where somebody's pet vulture nips off, and flies up and away with, some corporate executive's thumb?ABSOLUTELY NOT!"
1,I wanted to like this but...it's so darn awful!,"I can't remember the last time I watched such an awfully un-funny comedy. I had extremely high expectations given the talented duo of lead actors, and perhaps that fact has tainted my opinion, but this crapfest was just that: a giant festival of crap. I simply can't think of the words to accurately describe what a horrible, abysmal, and downright awful trainwreck of a movie this was. Steve Carrell obviously tried to make the best of the character he was given, but even his skill was no match for the dreck the writers came up with.I've never written a review for anything anywhere before but I felt compelled to write one here in the hope that at least one person would be saved from the traumatic spiral of festering poop that is Dinner For Schmucks. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
1,terrible.,"boring and predictable. just when you think it might start to gain some momentum, you realize you should have saved your $3.99 and bought more junk food at the 7-11. doubly disappointing because the cast is so promising. waste of money. boo."
1,"Mad I spent the money to rent it, Horrible!","I really couldn't believe how bad this movie since it has Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell but it was a bomb. There were a few times I did laugh but overall it is just poorly written, juvenile at best."
4,Better than expected,"I have to admit... I passed on this movie several times. However, I finally picked it up and watched it tonight and what a pleasant surprise! My wife, son, and I laughed out loud for most of the movie. What a great feeling. This is a much better movie than reviews indicate. Give it a chance... You just might be pleasantly surprised like we were!"
2,Definitely Carrell's worst,"It was mildly funny at times. But I have to say this is Steve Carell's worst. Not saying it was his fault but the character he played was not a Steve Carell character. It was more of a Jim Carrey/Ace Ventura character. Steve Carell doesn't need to try to be funny. He just is all by himself. The writing made him resort to 13 year old humor and it wasn't really needed. Carell is much funnier when he plays roles like he played in Dan in real life, 40 year old virgin, and Date Night. Not saying those movies were great but his roles in them were twice as funny. And in those he wasn't resorting to the type of humor found in this movie.Don't get me wrong, there were times in this movie that made me laugh but it still wasn't really worth the time I put into it to watch. Don't watch this expecting classic Steve Carell. Your 14 year old might like it though"
2,Dinner for Schmucks,This movie was kind of stupid . . . didn't hold my interest at all. I didn't think it was funny and I wish I hadn't purchased it.
3,"Cleans MAF sensors, won't improve gas mileage or HP.","After the dreaded check engine light came on, I figured my MAF sensor must have been dirty and so I decided to give this product a try. After 2-3 sprays this cleaner did indeed clean my MAF sensor, as it claims, and the light went away. Great! However, I did not notice either better gas mileage or increased horsepower on my car. And, logically, why would I? The product only cleans MAF sensors, it doesn't turn your car into a Ferrari! The only truthful claim CRC should make is ""this product will allow your MAF sensor to work at its best"". I'm only giving it 3 stars for the false/exaggerated claim CRC makes about better gas mileage and increased horsepower. Other than that, this is a good product which does indeed clean MAF sensors and which solved my problem."
3,"Entertaining, but...","I enjoyed ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" by Diamond, but much of this earlier book is developed further in ""Guns..."". So you don't gain much reading this book. As others have noted, Diamond has a highly-skilled, very readable style considering the complexity of his subject.I found some of his biases annoying: For example while calling the ""great leap forward"" unexplainable by any known change in physical characteristics of our ""ancesters"", he does not even consider the possibility that the human person has a non-physical component which may explain it.As others have also mentioned, he sometimes strays out of his field of competence and makes mistakes, eg: he says the Catholic Church teaches that the only legitimate purpose of sex is to have children, which it never has.I would suggest skipping this book and going straight to ""Guns, Germs and Steel""."
3,Blind spots,"Interesting, but flawed. Any book that tries to make such big generalizations about human sexuality and utterly ignores homosexuality is sweeping too much under the rug."
3,The print is too small,"The paperback is unreadable. The print is about thesize of your average legal document. The chain ofideas is poor. The book reminds me of a typicalcollege class required reading where the ""professor""says the same thing over and over and over, andjust never gets beyond the starting point. I learnedmore in one chapter reading ""LUCY"", and I did nothave to wade through elementary basics which assumesthe average reader knows nothing about the subject.This book needs to be cut by 50% and its line ofreasoning clarified."
2,Read Jared Diamond,"Out of Diamond's three books this one is the least attractive. I would marry Collapse, make Guns, Germs, and Steel my girlfriend, and hit and quit The Third Chimpanzee."
5,You Should Try,"If you are looking for a good, suspenseful cop story then you need to try ""Letter Perfect"" by N.H. Avenue.""Letter Perfect"" is the story of a female detective, Amanda Ross, who is trying to find the killer of a high-rolling financial advisor who was heavily into home-made movies.Although Amanda has several years on the force, she has started having panic attacks which cause her to doubt her ability as a cop. She is also an acknowledged lesbian and is being put through the test by a few of her counterparts who believe homosexuality is a bad thing.Amanda believes she can regain her footing by solving the murder of Charles Taylor, but the investigation gets complicated when she starts to fall in love with the victim's beautiful sister, Pamela, who is somehow involved.The story keeps you entertained and wondering what will happen in the next chapter.""Letter Perfect"" is easy reading and is the type of book that you find yourself halfway through before you put it down for the night."
5,Take Andrew Heringer with...,"We're all hooked on Andrew Heringer. Seriously. In our 16 year old daughter's words, ""Andrew rocks!"" Heringer's unique arrangements are a feast for the ears. His lyrics connect to our own lives. The strong narratives give us hope, and make us smile, sing out loud, and yeah--think. But don't take our word for it, take Andrew's: ""Wherever you're going won't you...take me with..."" You won't be sorry!"
2,Does not line up.,The plate will mount to it but the holes are a little too narrow to mount to the bumper by about 1/8 inch had to drill it out.
1,Missing parts,"As noted by a previous reviewer, the package contained only two screws. There are clearly four screws in the Amazon picture and the instructions tells you to use 4 screws. You'll need 2 additional screws to mount this bracket!!"
1,I wish I had gotten an iPod,I bought this because it had more bells and whistles than a similarly priced iPod. What I didn't realize that none of the things I wanted to listen to (podcasts mostly) were on iTunes--which won't work with anything but an iPod.Argh! This has been the most frustrating purchase I've made in a long time. It looks really nice but it can't actually play the kind of thing I want to listen to.
5,Great Christmas Present!,I was very happy with this purchase. A present for my Mom; she was overjoyed to find some of her favorite childhood candies that you can't often find in any store!
4,"a lot of good hip hop, a litlle of tony touch","if you, as myself, went crazy on tony touch's ""the piece maker"" cd, and want to buy another tony touch cd - this is the wrong place. tony touch is just introducing the songs on this cd - not producing them. anyhow, after the early dissapointment i sat down to listen to this cd and found some real good underground hiphop - amazing tracks by loose cannons, joefinite, drastic meassures and tony arafat, are creating a smooth collection of talents, and a fun cd to listen too. enjoy!"
1,Disappointing!,"When creating our wedding registry the first thing I did was register my fiance and I for a blender. We were in dire need of one. As soon as I received my blender I couldn't wait to use it. My fiance decided to make me a smoothie one night and to my surprise, the exact day we received the blender, once ice was added it died. The blender worked for approximately 2-3 minutes and stalled. I thought it over-heated or something. No such luck. It was dead. If I had it to do over again I would have registered for something else. But with a name with such prestige you would have thought an Oster would have produced something of better quality. Thankfully we received another blender as a wedding gift and plan to return the Oster. I would definitely not recommend this model of blender. Put out a few more dollars and buy something of better quality. Very disappointed with this blender!"
4,I love mine!,"I got this as a wedding gift. I had needed a blender forever and finally broke down and asked for one. I love mine! It takes care of everything that I have ever put in it. I use it for smoothies, shakes and juices. I have not tried food yet, but I will.I recommend it for the price. I love it."
1,Piece of JUNK,"Had blender for about a year and had trouble with it for day one. Just to make a shake, it would stall out and hum and smell like burning wires, finally would not work at all. Would leak even if half full. The drive shaft is small and flemsy, would work fine as long as the glass jar was not attached. Would advise anyone to stay away from Oster."
2,Bought one,"It may just be my setup, but high frequency sounds (cymbals etc) always have a staticy sound to them. And just recently (bought in december, it is may now) the modulator has cut out all FM stations when powered, I have to power it off to switch between radio and my omnifi."
2,Not worth the hassle,"I had to purchase two antenna lead adapters (one to adapt the antenna lead to the modulator and another to adapt the modulator's antenna out lead to the radio) in order to install this modulator in my Dodge vehicle. I don't know if it was a bad adapter, or a defective modulator, or just an expected side effect, but after installing it, I was unable to get any AM stations and only got the most powerful FM stations in the area. FM reception was probably 67% degraded (and AM obviously was 100% degraded). Furthermore the sound quality was less than my expectation (which was not high to begin with). My goal was to get a decent aux input for a reasonable cost; I ended up with unacceptably degraded radio reception, disappointing sound quality and spent almost as much as an OEM integration kit costs after adding the adapters (which cannot be returned). Recommendation: unless your radio uses the standard antenna lead connector, don't bother with this product."
4,"Great unit, beware of bad ones","I purchased two of these units, One was bad, Amazon return took a week but is was very easy.Switch, on this unit is very cheap, as is wiring.It works as advertised (this beats the crap out of any wireless FM modulator)"
3,Great Picture and Sound but no Extra Feateres,"I do not own this set nor do I plan to buy it because of the lack of extras and high price. I have seen this at a friends house and I have to say the quality is phenominal. I already own all thease movies on Vhs and thre is no reasan for me to pay for the same movie again and get noting extra. I will buy all thease movies though when the special Edition comes out fille with Theatrical Trailers, Audio COmmentaries, behind the scenes featuretts, and interviews. One thing that really bothers me is the Pinochio Vhs that was just released and a behind the scenes documantory but the dvd dosn't. What's up with that"
1,Rip-off,As said by others - just another Disney cash cow. Overpriced and poorly grouped (lion king 2 and no lion king?)
2,Not the best way to waste your money,"The only real adavntage this multi-pack has going for it is the fact that most of the DVD's are now unavaliable to buy seperately. So if you really want any or most of these Disney DVD's you need to buy this package. But if you want extras I suggest you wait. If you look hard enough you can even find these DVD's still seperately for sale at reasonable prices. Also some of these films, like Hercules, have already been rereleased in the Gold Collection. The new Disney DVD's are coming out with more and more bonus features. If you just hold out for a little while you can get new DVD's for a better price with more extras that just a trailer. Also if you hold off on purchasing this you won't get stuck with Simba's Pride. Nothing aganist the film but it does not deserve to be packaged with these classics. This is an incredably expensive product and could be very disappointing so I suggest you save you money for products that seem more promising."
4,Unbeatable at this price !!,"This toaster oven is very sufficinet for our normal needs. Unless I have to bake in large quantitis or broil something bigger, this is perfect. It toasts the bread and bagels evenly. Broils nicely. I even bake small cakes in this and they come out perfect.After buying this I have not yet used my bigger oven. It's very easy to clean and does not create lot of mess. It's size makes it quite portable. And for the price at which it is offered,I don't think any other toaster can beat it in it's performance."
2,Truly a terrible toaster oven . . .,"One half toasted. That's the story of this toaster. It does half the job.Be it bagels, toast, or warming something up you're going to need to monitor it (extremely slow) and then flip whatever you're toasting."
4,Good buy,I received the book in good condition. It is lightly used. I bought it for my cousin in South America. You cannot beat the price. I'm happy the book will have the opportunity to teach another person. Good buy!!
2,NEXT!,"Got this book as an extra resource for my organic chemistry class. It turned out not to be useful at all. First, it is kind of a very old version of organic chemistry and second every time I try to work with this book it has so much dust that I started to sneeze.Content. Well, it has a way of explaining basic concepts of the class. Yet I recommend to buy a more recent version of the book."
3,A Little Log Winded,I enjoyed the book but the main character was a bit annoying and it could have been 100 pages shorter.
4,New sort of plot,This is the first time I read that someone writes a book and somebody else makes the book a dream come true. I have to give A.B. a big star for her imagination.The book'll keep you reading but sometimes it repeat itself for example:How many times can a person say that she is responsible for all the killings?How many sex scenes with the same couple can you read in a book?How many times can a person apologize to another?Even with all unanswered questions I can recommend this book for a long flight or at the beach when you can read it or not whether you are in the mood for reading or not.
4,Great Investment!,"I purchased this breadmaker because of the express bake and extra features my current breadmaker doesn't have. My old bread maker I have been working solidly for 9 years however I work out of the home now and current breadmaker doesn't have delay bake timer or express bake so I can only use it on weekends. This Breadmaker is build solid with easy instructions, I just made an express bake loaf and it turned out great. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Not a good gift,"I had this sent to my sister as a gift, and she was not at all happy with it. No matter what she did, she could not get an acceptable loaf of bread."
1,Tough loaves,"I got this for christmas because I really wanted a new bread machine. Totally not worth it. The dough does not rise correctly in the machine, so I end up with tough half loaves with no flavor. I have tried several different recipes and they all come out awful. Selling this one and buying a breadman"
5,Takes the mess out of bread making,"I started using this machine as instructed by the manual, made a few loafs of different types and enjoyed the results; however, after feeling more enthusiastic about bread making, and reading about artisan breads, european breads (for my european wife), etc, I started using the machine for the mixing of the ingredients, the first rise and the first and second kneading only. It does all the messy work keeping my hands free to do other things, and after the second kneading, I take the dough out of the machine and knead it myself in a wooden dough bowl I brought from South America and use for this purpose only.I can make artisan breads with really good results, shape them any way I want, etc.I do not use the doug setting in the machine as it does not provide any heat while mixing or rising, I use the bread settings but stop the machine when I take the dough out to the wooden bowl."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I used two different bread machines before trying the Oster Expressbake Breadmaker. I never had any trouble with my very reliable Panasonic. The Oster machine has FEWER SETTINGS, is NOISY, MIXES POORLY, COOKS UNEVENLY, the DOUGH FALLS, and the LOAVES ARE UGLY. Additionally, the RECIPES ARE BLAND.There is a saying that goes, ""I am not rich enough to buy cheap stuff."" Invest in a good-quality bread machine that will last longer and produce beautiful, tasty loaves every time.A good example:Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker"
1,Horrible Experience!!!!! Dont Buy it!!!!,"I bought this and never worked, not even lit, totally damaged and did not receive any compensation, I felt cheated!"
4,Oster 5838 EXpress,"We purchased this item as a gift for our daughter and son-in-law. They have been using it regularly and are very pleased with the perfromance. This item has the Express Bake feature which our older bread maker does not. If we decide to purchase a new bread maker, we will definetly look for this feature as it substantially reduces timing. Love the product."
3,No manual.,1. Beware that this unit does not come with a hard copy manual although the product description in the ads says it should include one.2. The craftmanship of the metal work is coarse. The edge of the baking basket is almost sharp.3. It takes a struggle to remove the baking basket. It is either stuck to the bottom too tight or it does not get back into the position easily.
3,Slow Bread Maker,"The bread machine does a great job, but it takes about 4 hours to make most bread recipes in the book. Lots of planning ahead if you want bread with dinner!!"
3,"good bread, huge machine","This makes good bread. I did not have any of the problems of the other reviewers. However, it is really huge, and I was expecting a smaller machine."
5,great bread maker,"Great bread machine reasonable price , starting making bread out of the box ,already made about 40 loafs of bread ,I recommend this machine , Im even thinking about buying another machine to make more faster"
5,Great Breadmaker! It's better than my old White Westinghouse,I had an seven year old White Westinghouse bread machine that eventually broke. We went out an purchase the Oster 5838 because it was a horizontal bread machine. We had a vertical and I wanted to try something different this time. This machine has worked well. So far I've only baked 2 loaves of regular white bread. Both came out better than my old bread machine loaves! The bread was wonderful. We really like this one. I would recommend this one to anyone who wants to bake their own bread. I liked it so much I took a few pictures to show the product and the bread! Enjoy!
2,Not impressed,"After reading many reviews, I ordered the Oster, hoping for a machine that was durable, like my last Oster. The loaf pan is a very thin piece of tin wrapped with teflon coating on the inside. The brackets that hold the loaf pan in place nearly broke, as I had to force the pan out of the maker. I only made 2 loaves - neither raised well, but taste was okay. The lid was not too secure either, but seemed to hold the heat in alright. I'm returning this unit and will try my luck with another brand. I really liked my first Oster from about 8 years ago - and am rather disappointed with this current model. The quality seems to be lacking."
3,A little unhappy with the performance,"There are a couple of things I don't like, the first is that it frequently doesn't mix everything properly and the loaves end up with chunks of flour in the corners, so you have to watch it mix, which means you can't really use the timer.The other is the paddle wheel stays inside the bread when you remove it from the pan, and tears a huge hole in the bottom of the loaf when you remove it.The pan is deep, so it's really only suited for 2 pound loaves, but it's only a problem if all you have are recipes for 1 1/2 pound loaves.Otherwise, it's an ok machine."
4,HOMEMADE BREAD PRICELESS,"I love this machine, I really enjoy the delayed timer, to come home to the smell of homemade bread from work is so inviting. I also like the style, the bread is horizontal like a regular loaf of bread. Kansas Farmers watch out, this household is going to buy more flour to make our own heathly preserative free loaf."
4,What is the problem?,"We had an Oster bread machine several years ago but, when it ""died,"" we did not replace it until a month ago. We had a problem with the first loaf (1-1/2 pound size) but since we moved to the 2-lb loaf, and to the present, we have not had any problems producing tasty, properly formed and finished bread. We shaved the amount of salt and bumped the amount of yeast to get it more to our taste but have had none of the problems described in many of the other reviews."
3,Food Saver Quick Marinator 2 1/4 quart,"It's good for meats and veggies for right now, can't wait to eat. It's a fast cleanup and put away."
1,Buy the VacMaster instead!,"I purchased both this item and theVacMaster 87653 Vacuum Marinator 2-1/2-Quart with Black Lid. There is no comparison between the quality of the two. The VacMaster container is twice as thick and has a much better sealing system.Note - I've used both connected to aVacMaster Portable Chamber Vacuum Sealer w/ 12 Inch Seal Bar VP112 - Perfect for Sous Vide. Tonight, the FoodSaver imploded (kind of scary) and the pieces are now in the garbage. The VacMaster container was sealed at the same pressure level with no problems."
4,Great for quick marinade!,"I've been using this when I forgot to marinate something for dinner. So far just chicken and steaks. It works great. I'd give it 5 stars if you could put the lid in the dishwasher; the bottom is dishwasher safe only (top shelf of dishwasher).Also, just be sure to spin the knob to closed BEFORE removing the vaccuum tube (I know it seems obvious, but you'd be surprised...)"
5,Good Purchase!,We like to marinate quite often and I was using a food storage bag every time. This works better and is reusable. Glad I got it.
4,Not just for mainating,"I use this to store baked goods (shortbread, bars, cookies) as well as slices of deli meat and cheese. I always wash and dry this by hand. Minus one star because the bottom is not flat like the canisters -- takes too long to get all the water out of the crevices."
2,"Certainly important, but I don't like it","Jose de Alencar is certainly one of the most important Brazilian novelists, but I don't like his novels. ""Iracema"" and ""Senhora"" were the first two novels that I read in Brazilian Romanticism and I thought I didn't like Romanticism at all until I read ""A Escrava Isaura"" by Bernardo Guimaraes. But, liking it or not, this book is mandatory for those who want to get in touch with Brazilian Romantic Literature."
5,The Best!,"This is my favorite of the three Myst novels. It should answer all of your questions,and it should raise a few more. Once I started reading, I did nothing else!"
5,Better than the game,"Having played the game MYST, I found the style and feel of the game very intriguing, but the actual play to be weak. When I picked up the book, I was expecting a bit of fluff written for third graders. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the story well-developed and engrossing while the style of the game had been maintained.A book for those with imagination. Highly recommended."
3,If you couldn't get enough of the game ....,"No, it doesn't stand on its own. But it isn't as bad as anticipated.The story is somewhat pretentious and DUNE like, but that's why you'llread it. It gets interesting towards the end and is a quite satisfyingprequel to the game. It climaxes with Atrus' journal entry noting hisloss of the MYST book, the same narrative which opens the game.The book itself,e.g.,the binding, artwork and leaves are a treat."
4,A UNIQUE FANTASY READ,"Many are familiar with Myst as the #1 smash computer game hit. However, how many are familiar with the fantasy series? The first book in the Myst cycle is called the Book of Atrus. The reads like any other, plot, characters, setting etc. However what is truly exciting about this book in particular is the history which unfolds before the readers eyes.Anyone who has played the Myst games would instantly fall in love with this book. And for the others who have not they will as well. Rand Miller weaves a tale of mystery, deceit and ultimately love around the characters of Atrus, Gehn, and Anna.\We learn where Myst island comes from, who created Riven, and how some of the pieces of the puzzle fit together. This is an excellent read, not fast paced but interesting."
4,Great Book! Great Author,You can't go wrong with a book by Paul Keenan. Father Keenan makes the Stages of the Soul understandable for everyone. Do not miss this book. No kidding.
1,Failed attempt at literary success,This story is an absolute failure by an over confident english professor that should not be teaching let alone writing. Don't spend the time or the money on the book. The only reason I read it was the fact that it was assigned by the author himself.
4,Good resource.,This is a great book for Irish music but I do wish it had a better way of presenting the titles by the tunes other names. It makes it difficult to run them down sometimes but I am glad I bought the book.
3,incomplete sound track,"A very pleasant movie with a great sound track, but I am at a loss as to why the harvest scene's ""We plough the fields and scatter"" is left out and not available."
3,what a surprise,"The movie has a wonderful soundtrack, but not all the songs I loved to hear in this movie, are on the CD. The CD is not bad, but it's not the big thing, I expected to buy."
2,soundtrack at its best,The soundtrack is one of the best i have heard. I can close my eyes and be transported back to that wonderul movie.
5,Heaven on Earth!,"The beauty of the musical compositions paired with Joshua Bell's extraordinary talent make this absolute heaven to listen to. The ""Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra"" is so stirring it brings tears to my eyes. Sample it, you'll love it."
5,Exceptionally beautiful,"Absolutely the most beautiful music I have ever heard. Luddite that I am, would even consider getting an Ipod to carry it with me."
1,Burnt out on first use,"I followed the directions to the letter, and not only did it burn out and cease to function on the first batch, but the rice was sticky. This isn't my first rice cooker, so I know there are better products out there."
3,not as good as it looks,"i got this bag because im on deployment and i needed a sea bag, although i knew it wasnt the regular us navy sea bag like i needed, it looked like the closest. after getting it i found out how it only has a drawstring close, and it sure isnt waterproof. i dont think this is going to make in through the airport, dont know if it will hold up. could of been better."
1,Just a Baby Bottle Washer,Does not clean the side of the Thermos because it is too stiff and it will not even clean the bottom. I scrubbed for half an hour and looked into the thermos and the bottom only had a small area that was clean...So this looks like it will work but it won't...Automatic dish soap and boiling hot water. Shake every five minutes for 20 minutes and it will be as clean as a whistle only way to clean a thermos.
1,Not worth it,"What's there to say... I was looking for a halfway decent bottle brush, but this one simply isn't half decent.The very first time I used it, bristles from the end fell out. Because of how it's made, with the pressure from the twisted metal holding the bristles in place, once they start falling out the remaining bristle are looser and fall out all the quicker. The side bristles are still fine, but it's not a bottle brush when the bristles for scrubbing the bottom of the bottles all fall out.Maybe mine was just a manufacturing error, but I'd say look for something else. MAYBE if you could buy them for two bucks a piece to use a few times and throw away then fine, it might be worth it. At five bucks+ with shipping added in?? No way."
5,A Fork in the Road,"Found this movie on Netflix and loved it so much I had to buy it. Have lent it to friends and they bought it. It's definitely my kind of movie. If you live by Murphy's Law (What ever can go wrong, will go wrong) you'll appreciate it."
3,Was there even one redeaming character?,"There is so much and so little to say about this book. Mostly the characters, all of them were really either nasty, selfish, stupid, and all unappealing. That says a lot for me. I am actually surprised I kept reading. I expect so much more from a Cheryl Holt book - what has happened - I have not liked any of her recent books.This was not horrible - it was to a degree intersting but the people were just not worth caring about!"
2,Too Boring To Read,"I agree that this one is a dud. I couldn't finish it. The characters were flat and unlikeable.For a great Cheryl Holt read, her earlier books are much better."
1,say good by to white counter tops,My girlfriend bought this for me or I'd never use it again. It does make tea but it vibrates out of position and just makes a tea stained mess all over. Dont dare to put it in a cookie sheet to contain it or it will fill and possibly short out the heating element. they should have stuck with the regular coffee drip design and it would have been perfect. horse whip the engineer that designed this mess maker!!!
1,Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Pot 3 Qt.,I had an older model and it worked great. This model leaked between the pitcher and the machine. I had tea all over the counter and the only way for it not to leak is to hold it pressed against the machine. I went back to my older one and it works great. We tried the new one 8 times and it leaked 6 of thoes eight. Just not what I wanted.
5,Over 15 years of use and still going strong,I rec'd the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea maker as a wedding gift over 15 years ago. It is the model with the red top. It had two pitchers. One of the pitcher cracked last week (after 15 years of use). I have put the pitchers through the dishwasher on many occasions through the years. I have never had a problem with the pitchers warping. I believe a previous rater may have hit the nail on the head. The problem is likely because the user may not be filling the pitcher with iced BEFORE making the tea. This cools the tea down immediately and will prevent warping or overheating of the pitcher. I use only 1 family sized Lipton tea bag and either sugar or splenda and do not use a coffee filter but I DO fill the pitcher with ice before making the tea. It makes great tea like this. I would love to have replacement pitcher (in case my other pitcher finally cracks) but I don't know which one to order as I cannot find a model # on my unit.
1,SUCKS - Leaks everywhere,"No matter how carefully I place the pitcher under the spout, I end up having more tea on my counter and floor than I do in the pitcher."
1,not what I wanted,"I ordered 2 qt. as you can plainly see, but what they sent and invoiced me for was the 3 quart which I was trying to replace.Too much hassle to exchange. Very unhappy.."
2,Not pleased with this product at all..........Poor Quality,"This tea maker worked great the first 8-10 times, but after that, things started going down hill quickly. The pitchers (it came with a second, and now I know why)were the first to go. The instructions claim the pitchers are dishwasher safe on the top rack, but no, they are not safe on the first rack. Not knowing that my first pitcher had sprung a leak, my second made its way to the top rack too, now both are leaking right below their spouts. ""Just use another pitcher"" you say? Nah, you can't, those are the only pitchers I have found that work with the maker. And to top it ALL off, the maker itself no longer completely works either. It fails to percolate all the required water.......I am T TOTALLY displeased with this product. I gave it a ""2"" because it worked great, like I said, the first 8-10 times. I am looking into a Hamilton Beach maker now......"
1,Inferior leaky model needs recall,"Like other users have experienced, this model leaks a great deal from the machine base and makes a mess all over. To cope with it, I bought a utencil container. I place both the machine and pitcher in it to contain the mess. More tea is ending up in the container than the pitcher. A friend of mine who bought one on my recommendation (before it started leaking) has said she is experiencing the same thing.I have used the older round pitcher model with the rust tops for years without incident. They had a much longer shelf life than this one.If I were the company, I'd recall this model."
5,Happy with mine!,I had previously owned the Mr. Coffee TP30. I had a problem with the tea missing the pitcher while brewing and ending up all over my counter sometimes and then after a while the seams in the pitcher began having cracks and leaking every time I made tea. I have had the TM50P about a week now and have not had any problems with it leaking at all. The lid fits good and as long as you have the lid on when pouring it doesn't leak as others have said they had a problem with. As far as it continuing to drip after the tea makes you simply need to be sure to take the brewing basket out when it is finish and you will not have that problem. I am hoping this pitcher will not have the problem of cracking and leaking since it is double lined.
2,We loved it...until Daisy and Donald's arms fell off,"Thought product was great for my 21 month old daughter who is obsessed with Mickey and friends. Two weeks after receiving the figures, the arms of Donald and Daisy popped off, which is not safe for a little one who still puts things in her mouth. Made in China...too bad, Disney."
3,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Figure Set,"I ordered this for Christmas. The set is just ok. My daughter is 32 months old, and gets very frustrated because she cannot get them to stand. I have tried to myself and Mickey and Pluto are the only ones to stay in position. It was hard to find the characters all together so I will keep, but I would not buy again or recommend."
2,Didn't really like,These were a lot smaller than the Mickey mouse toys they sell now. They don't stand up correctly and always fall over. My kids still kind of play with them but they like the newer ones better
2,very dissapointed,"It stated it was a NEW product. NOT NEW. It had tape around the package to hold it together. The figurines were scratched, and it was noticeable. Better price @ Disney store for like 12 bucks, and if you buy 2 it comes like around 20 bucks."
2,It's OK,Very dissapointed as they didn't work with the club house. By boy is 2 and the fun only lastest a day or so. He still loves Mickey and the gang but to watch on TV not play with.
2,Age appropriate Disney Characters,"I was expecting a more durable product and the Pluto dog was broken in half, exposing sharp plastic...this toy set was intended for a 2 1/2 yr. old child and when I saw that for the price, I called and returned the damaged product. I found the same exact characters in the same clothes and style made out of durable rubber for the bath set that were 5"" instead of 3"" and cheaper. I ordered them and they are safe to include infants and the price was much lower from the Disney store, as Amazon didn't have them.I had also questioned the paint on the smaller ones as it chipped off on the broken piece. When buying items like this, please check age appropriateness, manufacture, and durablity of product...I called and asked questions and nobody knew if they were lead painted as they were made in China."
3,too small to be practical,"The colors are vivid and pretty. However, the teapot is too tiny for my taste, it's just not very practical. Good as decoration."
2,Disappointing. Skip it.,"Little of value. Sold it almost immediately. His ""Joel on Software,"" which I kept, is much more interesting."
2,Poor Quality,Lutron has not quite got the screwless plates under control yet.... Id buy the Cooper Wiring Devices plate if i where you.
4,It's ok,THIS GAME WAS MORE CHALLENGEING THAN THE REG. ONE. i'D RECOMEND GETTING THE LOOPY LANDSCAPES EXP.2 PACK IF YOU WANT THIS GAME
2,what a disappointment!,"don't listen to all these other reviews. unless you're a rollercoaster FREAK, this game get's old very fast! don't waste your money on it. the graphics aren't very good either."
5,Ended at the right time,"I'm glad they didn't turn this into a 24 and go on for 7 or 8 seasons. Superb story line, acting and suspense."
2,The Killing online is too dark!,"While I love the show and like the fact that they are shooting in a style that matches the dark subject matter, adding to the drama, I was unable to see what was happening. Almost the whole show was black and shadowy, leaving me to guess at what they were doing. Drove me mad but I had missed it on TV when my DVR somehow didn't tape the show and this was my only option. Have to make sure this doesn't happen again!!"
5,the killing season 2,This series was captivating and we could not stop watching it. We watched the whole season over the weekend. We are hooked on this one. I have recommended it to all my friends
5,Excellent!,"Well-written, dark, raining all the time--my hometown Seattle is portrayed as equally awful and stunning all in one!This is a well-written and wonderfully-acted series--wish it were renewed for the third season, but so far...looks bad for it."
3,Neither Phish nor Foul,"There are some decent oldies strewn around here, but they can be found in better suuroundings or original oldies compilations. The covers by contemporary artists such as Blink 182, Semisonic, and Blues Boy King may be of curious interest to completests.The best of the ""new"" cuts made for this Made for TV mock-u-mentory, the sweet, sweet, Chante Moore vocal with the Emeralds on ""WALL AROUND MY HEART"", beats all. That cut is as strong as anything on the Tom Hanks produced film THAT THING YOU DO.Honestly, if your heart is into remarks of oldies but goodies or you just can't pull your self away from your stratchy 45's, try the briliantly right-on GRACE OF MY HEART soundtrack (movie was ok too), or even the campy guest-fest by Shudder To Think, ""First Love, Last Rites"" (soundtrack)....on the other hand, it's better than Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart."
4,Very good but biased,"The photos and content is very good but in several instances the most relevant models are not mentioned or illustrated. i.e. Matchless G50,M.V. Agusta 750s. Ducati 750SS roundcase. It seems that the authors preferences, easy of access to a machine (for photos) or conveniences are sometimes sacrificed for the important item. In general it is a very good general info book. Shows some really strange machines."
5,Buddy at his best!,"Very happy with this purchase. Buddy Ebson does a departure from the role that made him famous, and with style only he could muster. The overall impression is very ""70's"", but I'd have to say, the way this series is put together had to have had some influence on how many others in the same venue were done. Sort of laid the ground work for how to do detective shows for tv. I enjoy it very much, in particular Mr. Ebson's performances and certainly look forward to the release of the following seasons. I like how the discs are set up, you can watch a ""preview"" of the episode or just watch each one in it's entirety. Lots of good guest stars and all in all, a very good bargain for the asking price. I highly recommend this set."
3,Too Pricey for only 13 episodes,"Shows might be great but come on, there are only 13 episodes in the 1st season so lower the price accordingly for I'm sure not paying this much."
3,Not as good as Monster in a Box,"If you are searching for a decent Spaulding Gray recording, try ""Monster in a Box"". ""It's a Slippery Slope"" is recorded mostly in a studio. At some points in the dialogue, Mr. Gray inserts the live version of the monologue. You realize when this occurs that his cadence of speech actually changes in front of a live audience. He leaves spaces to allow for the audience laughter and reaction and the effect is noticeable. He is much more interesting playing to an audience. ""Monster in a Box"" was recorded entirely in front of an audience and it is excellent. Mr. Gray's new material is interesting, but the delivery of the audio in a studio makes it somewhat boring."
4,great soundtrack!,Another great soundtrack. The theme song is very quiet yet inspiring.Track 2 is one of my favorites.
1,Vide Cor Meum,"Hi,Actually the Music of the death of the king has been composed by Patrick Cassidy. He also made a great cd called ""Immortal Memory"" with lisa gerard.Vincent(From Belgium)"
1,add me to the list.,add me to the list of owners with these problems:1) leaky.2) overflows getting grounds everywhere3) pause feature either doesn't work or it overflows grounds.4) clock/timer resets intermittently.
1,Worst of the Worst,Leaks water from the REMOVABLE water reservoir. The bottom is now rusty and it is questionable just how safe it is now electrically.
1,"problems, problems, problems","I thought I was the only one with the bad coffemaker! I see, from other reviews, that I am not alone.Bad stuff-Reservoir leaks water - very often.Flimsy plastic material peels and cracks off front controls.I followed the lead of another reviewer by e-mailing Mr. Coffee. Well, they must be tired of hearing from us because I was told to send the coffeemaker to the factory for repair. The turnaround time would be a month! What would I brew coffee with in the meantime? Shall I hold the ground coffee in my hands and let scalding water trickle into a bowl?Stay away from this machine. Too many problems for the price you'll pay."
3,The sound leaves something to be desired,"I've really enjoyed the EMI Gemini series of classical music offerings, but unfortunately the sound on this one is not very good. It was apparently recorded in the early '70's, and clarity is lacking. Still nice to listen to, but you can do better."
3,Brings out a different perspective to religious music,I could preview all the songs on the CD before buying and therefore had an opportunity to buy axactly what I wanted. I know previews do take alot of internet time and ideally would require to be not too long or short but maybe people should be given the choice if they want to listen to the whole track. It makes the product a little more worthwhile to buy. Still a good product I must say.
4,THIS UNIT FEATURES BIG SOUND WHEN PAIRED WITH A GOOD SUB..,"THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM SOUNDS QUITE GOOD WHEN PAIRED WITH A GOOD SUB.HOWEVER,THERE ARE MANY BETTER SPEAKER SYSTEMS OUT THERE...THESE SPEAKERS WILL APPEAL PRIMARLY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT BIGGER,..HAS TO BE BETTER....THE SPEAKERS PRESENT AN EXCELLENT SOUND STAGE. THEY ARE A LITTLE BRIGHT.THE SPEAKERS DEMAND A LOT OF POWER,AND HIGH CURRENT TO SOUND AT THEIR BEST. ENOUGH,.THEY DO PRESENT QUITE A !!!WOW !!!FACTOR...PLEASE AUDITION THESE BEFORE BUYING...ON 11/11/05....AMAZON WAS OFFERING FREE SHIPPING.!!!"
5,Excellence in Paperback,"Lost Angel is one of the best books I have ever read. It grabs your attention and holds it, you won't want to put it down. Cyrus has a way with words!I am sure that John Lennon would have loved this book, it reminds me of his song ""Watching the Wheels Go Round."" Lost Angel is movie material, I think, honestly.Jess"
1,Awesome,It was awesome for my kid she love this bookIt is really funny she loves to read Junie B Jones
3,just okay,"Cute and fun, but nothing extraordinary. A group of expatriate ninjas-in-training set off to complete their final exam: to reach their erstwhile castle and retrieve a magic scroll. Meanwhile, some no good types are looking for the princess who previously escaped their evil clutches when, as a baby, she was spirited away from the castle under seige. Which of the Ninja Cadets is she? Will any of them manage to pass the exam? Will evil finally triumph over good? .. nah. But it is entertaining watching them fight all those battles [It's a giant frog! Run for your lives!]."
1,"not good, no power",1st time out it did not whip hard enough for meringue mix... I'm returning it.... awful. I expect my kitchen equipment to be better than that.
3,Keeps your attention,"This book definitely keeps your attention for the simple fact that it is so strange. I really admire this woman for living in a tree for two years for a good cause. It seems like a great adventure to write about. The book was well written, and I even am a member of the Sierra Club, but this girl is different."
3,Good Read - But Falls Flat,"This was good relaxing read for me - but it fell short. While I left with a good impression of Julia's life in the tree, I didn't feel that the book had any lasting significance. While I'd recommend the book, I wouldn't run out and buy it.I felt that the book did not give enough context and really show the true importance of what happened. Likewise, it didn't create an imperative for action or serve as any kind of a guide for others in the environmental movement.The ending, especially, seemed rushed. There were several typos in the text.Julia Hill really did make a difference - but her book doesn't help one expand beyond the realm of her action into greater significance... and, for this reason, her book is interesting (certainly have much more respect for her hardships) but not a classic of environmental literature."
3,If you get one that works....,"Mine was broken right out of the box. The blades wouldn't turn, though a little twisting would loosen them a little. However if you ran it they froze right back up. And I thought the K-mart lady was joking when she offered to sell me a years warranty for it.Took it back and all they had was the same thing. Seems to work well. Customer service was good at Mr. Coffee though."
1,"Avoid, burns up quickly.","These grinders are weak, read the instructions which will instruct you to wait a minute between grinding coffee beans. If you have one, it will burn the motor out, just a matter of time. Works good if you only grind small amounts, do not grind a full lid full. Went through two of these, total junk!"
2,Avoid This Coffee Grinder,"This is not a well made grinder. From the first time I used it, I knew this was not a Krups or a Braun. Mine lasted 4 months (the motor burned out) and I make coffee only on the weekends."
4,"Tyler Perry, David Talbert...meet Kibwe Dorsey","It's great to see films that are inspiring and not just about sex, drugs and violence. Kibwe brings a timeless message to never give up and it's a message that should never grow old! Kibwe is a hidden gem, I pray Tyler Perry or David Talbert get a chance to see his work and feature him in one of their plays or movies his voice is truly unique and worthy to share with the world. I am anxious to see more from him and to see how he grows and improves on each project. I am inspired."
3,review20,Shipping and price great. The snap was slightly different in that it did not detach from the case. But it works good enough.
3,A few good songs,"I bought this for I am Free, love this song. Great one to teach the kids and dance around the living room too. Kids love it and it's easy for them to learn"
5,Great Product for on the go.,"Bought this for the camper - wanted to boil pasta and sausages while camping - With the lid on, this got up to a rolling boil quickly, cooked great. A small mess with boil over, so watch for that. The included strainer basket is very low quality - but not what I bought it for. The non-stick coating is great - it cleaned up easily with a sprayer. Great product, does just what I need it to."
3,It works ok,"The dimensions are correct and it is sturdy. However I found out the chrome layer is thin, it started rusting right away. I expected it to take a while for the chrome to wear off, for my use level, about a season. However it started rusting before I even used it. Most hitch balls will rust, it just makes me wonder about their quality control if it rusts so quickly."
2,Could Not Finish,"I really loved the idea of this novel about journeys on the Oregon Trail. But I found the prose very difficult to become interested in: neither the words nor the sentences sprang to life or lured me in. Nor did the characters. Nor did the plot. I never felt that the author was creating a story for me, the reader."
3,Punctures fairly easily,"It seals pretty well, but you'll need to protect it from rough exposure otherwise it will puncture fairly quickly. Price was a bit high too."
3,electric skillet,"I was pretty disappointed that I had to assemble the skillet after it arrived. Once I did, the skillet is terrific. The size is just right and I'm very happy with how easy it is to wash."
2,Almost a really good skillet,"The design of this skillet is really quite good. It is deep enough with a very useful control and a nicely domed cover... Unfortunately the attention in detail is very shoddy. The finish on the bottom is rough, the control is hard to insert and the glass in the cover is just silly and one more thing to go wrong. It arrived with two broken parts on the cover since Target shipped it in a box which was hugely too big for the item and it rattled around enough to braek the cover. I would not again order anything to be shipped from Target. However, at 19.99 it is useable for frying when the cover is not needed."
3,precaution noted,"We enjoy the flexibility of an electric skillet, especially during the hot summer months. Over the years we have used many brands. We purchased the Rival in the fall of 2003 and we used it frequently.This is an excellent product, especially at this price. It is one of the few electric skillets we've owned that provides an even heat across the pan. The ""simmer"" actually simmers.However, I do feel a safety precaution should be noted. Sadly, last night as I picked up the Rival by its handles, the one-piece handle/leg broke. Luckily, the skillet was not in use."
2,disappointed in the quality,"The seams on the coat ripped after just 2 or 3 uses. The sizing is good, the quality is not."
4,"Paulina Simons ""Tully""","The book was in good condition and was shipped in a timely manner.The story was not to my liking and does not compare with the author'sbook ""The Bronze Horseman""."
4,Paullina Simons' First Effort,"I had read her ""Bronze Horseman"" and ""Tatiana and Alexander"" so was curious to see how her first effort was. It was long, as are all her works. After a slow start, it was worth reading but don't expect everyone to live happily ever after. In that it is like real life, but some readers don't like that in a fiction book. I enjoyed it and was glad that I read it. Not as good as the others I read, though."
4,wonderful book,"I saw this book in a used bookstore and bought it because of it's length (I love thick books). It did not disappoint. Although Tully's childhood is heartbreaking and the way she handles her adult relationships is saddening, you never find yourself angry with her. The urge to flip to the last page to find out if Tully does or does not find happiness is overwhelming. A great book whose characters you think about long after you read the last page."
2,Read it... but don't take it too seriously.,"I cannot believe how many people so strongly enjoyed this book. It is slow, unbelievable and incredibly depressing. Perhaps for readers who have not experienced Tully's difficult type of life it seems exciting and moving, but for someone who has, it is painful and unimportant. This book does NOT present an inspirational character that can show women how to be strong and move on through terrible experiences, but rather a heroine that is selfish, wallows in self-pity and uses her unhappy childhood as an excuse to be a self-centred and manipulative woman. From a literary point of view the book is well-written but the content is waffle and at times comes close to torture. However it is worth reading simply to see for yourself what all the hype is about."
3,Frustrating,This was a good book overall. I was very frustrated with the characters in the book but to me this is what makes a book good. Tully for one was a very FRUSTRATING GIRL!!!! I wanted to put the book down but I wanted to see how everything was going to end up. I had to give this book 3 stars. Although it was a good story I don't think it need to be so long. There were a lot of parts that were really drawn out and boring. In my opinion this was not Paullina's best book.
5,One of the best books I ever read!,I loved every line of this book! I loaned it to a friend and never recieved it back however I plan to purchase again!!
1,Horribly boring and unbelievable to boot!,"This book is one of the worst books I've read in the last 5 years. Example: Her best friend kills herself because Jack doesn't love her. It turns out that Jack has been in love with Tully for several years because he remembers how sexy she was when she danced with him once? Give me a break! According to the characterizations, Tully doesn't care about herself, or anyone else, and yet the two men in the story change their whole lives just to be with her? Perhaps her attractions are that she constantly sheds her clothes at the drop of a hat. I think the people who liked this book may enjoy the fantasy contained in this book, but I though the character was so unlikeable I actually had to give up reading halfway through. The writing is atrocious and the plot repetitive. Also, all the other characters are seen as one-dimension and are only described as how they relate to Tully. They are all truly shallow!"
4,I actually like Disc II quite a bit,Not sure why people are not liking this disc - I like it quite a bit. I like the robustness of Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor. I also quite like Frank Martin's rather angular Mass for Double Choir.
4,A personal side of the president,"This book, written around the turn of the 20th century, provides a personal documentary to the life of our 16th president. A great amount of this book chronicles the early part of the president's life, and it gave me a new appreciation for what he did to preserve the union. I got a much more in-depth look at him than I had in school, and it piqued a new interest in Civil War history in me."
2,The Life of Abraham Lincoln,Did not care for this book as there was too much written about the politics in Lincoln's time. I would have liked to read more about his personal life.
4,Quick and easy,"This pot is great for making quick fondue. Unfortunately, it comes with a really short cord. I have to use an extension cord to set it on the table. Also, it seems to be either too hot or not hot enough. On the plus side, I have washed it in the dishwasher a bunch of times with not a single problem. I make a lot of fondue & it has been very reliable. It's good when you want to make a quick fondue dinner & not have to deal w/the fuel pots and all the irritation that goes along with that. I like this pot overall. Great bargain, too!"
4,Come on in the water's fine!,"This was my introduction to Atlanta's new wave scene. The guitar work alone is worth it, mainly because of Glenn Phillips - a celebrated guitarist. The hidden (or not so hidden) gem in this band is the vocals by Anne Richmond Boston. Buy this album! Your music collection will thank you and the friends you play it for will thank you for their introduction into the lesser known side of new wave Atlanta. Also look for the Q's self titled album ""Swimming Pool Qs."
3,There Is A Reason You Never Heard Of Them,The band is just as inexplicable and uninteresting as their name would imply.
2,Unpleasant Reading,"As a Troggs fan, I was thrilled to see a biography had hit the shelves. I bought it immediately. Joy soon turned to disappointment as I struggled to decipher the totally convoluted syntax filling these pages. Sentences go on and on and on, packed with references so obscure, I couldn't read it for more than a couple minutes at a time. And I'm very familiar with 60's British slang and culture. The book is still worth laboring through if you're a big Troggs fan, but be prepared for a difficult slog."
1,Bootleg DVD... beware!,"This is a bootleg of a 1989 European TV Broadcast of Pink Floyd (Mach III) in Venice, Italy. That is a tolerable show, and decently filmed pro-shot show with decent sound.Beware of bootlegs.You can download this very same show for free on several fan sites."
2,A Bit Disappointed in the Game,"Somehow I was expecting more when I saw the names Hasbro and Pooh. The game is alright, but it is very basic in nature and doesn't hold the kids' attention for as long as I would have liked. I did think it was a cute concept that the game board is comprised of several puzzle pieces that the children need to put together to form the board."
5,Edited Version of Rocko's Modern Life,"Finally, Rocko's Modern Life, Aahhh!! Real Monsters, Hey Arnold & Angry Beavers are getting released properly on DVD! It's about time Nickelodeon! Thanks Shout!The only problem is that Shout Factory has stated that Rocko's Modern Life is the edited version that's being released on dvd. This disappoints me slightly...but at least we are getting a dvd!Here is the statement left on Shout Factory's website, ""Please note that the only available masters for this show are the rebroadcast episodes, some of which contain minor edits for adult content""."
4,Not as big,we thought it would be the same size as the one we currenty own but the light itself was abuot half the size
1,Assembly was difficult for this Verilux Lamp,"The pieces of this lamp are heavy and difficult to maneuver, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, but the company did not include a necessary L wrench to secure the pieces together. The directions were vague, but I managed to put it together without securing the shafts together for now. It works, but it is not necessarily safe as is. I had other L wrenches and small screwdrivers that didn't fit the holes. In the long run, although I'm not going to return it, I feel this item was not worth the price."
1,Beware of this product and its warranty,"I purchased this lamp on August 3, 2012. It worked for the first month, but then started flickering off at the slightest motion near it. Then it started just going off with no motion or vibration in the room. The product has a ""One Year Limited Warranty"". Very limited, as I found out. Upon calling the manufacturer I was told that not only would I have to pay shipping cost back to them (expected and how it works generally), but I would also have to pay over $20 for them to ship a new light to me. According to the customer service rep this problem for this model light cannot be fixed. In order to get a replacement light for the one that only worked for less than two months it would cost me over $40.Although Verilux is considered a reputable company I have totally lost confidence in their products and feel that I cannot afford to buy another Verilux light or waste more money on this light for all the shipping."
5,Light to help with macular degeneration,This light helps my husband to see. He also has a desk lamp like it he likes them both.
3,"Good light, questionable value","I opted for this lamp over another, cheaper, brand because in the pictures it looked to be of better construction. After looking into the cost of replacement bulbs, I probably should have went for the cheap unit. Generic 27 watt florescent bulbs can be found for between five and ten dollars. Unfortunately, generic bulbs won't fit the Verilux socket. Only Verilux makes a bulb that will, and they want twenty dollars for them. Of course, with an estimated life span of 10,000 hours, the bulb could easily last ten or more years. Still, I wonder how much extra value one gets for the higher price of both the lamp and the replacement bulbs.That said, the lamp makes a good reading light, and it does look to be well constructed. It doesn't seem as bright as I would have thought for a 150 watt equivalent, but the light is very white and easy on the eyes, especially compared to incandescent. Assembly was easy enough, but would have been easier with help."
1,stopped working,"got it, loved it, week later the switch is not working. a huge hassle to pack up and send back."
5,Cool ring,I've had a lot of compliments on it. Cool and modern. Size seems true. Comfortable. Good price. Wait no more. Get it.
3,Like the others....,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I had read the true crim book of slaying years ago, but recalled enough to be interested in this movie when I saw it in the video store.It has it moments of protraying the central characthers as they were, but a lot of the moments seemed wooden or not ""life-like"". There was no passion...truly felt passion. Annette Bening and Kingly are both top notch actors, so I feel it was the direction that is lacking here. It certainly explains the murder, the case, the different sides to the story plainly enough. Just with not as much eloquence or excitement as the case would merit.I did enjoy it, I just expected a lot more."
4,"Not Bad, Books is always better",I read the book then saw the movie version. As usual the book is usually better but it was interesting to actually see the story played out by such amazing actors. Kind of jumped around so if I hadn't read about it first it would likely have been confusing. Based on a true story. The book is called Very Much a Lady by Shana Alexander and is an excellent read.
2,Not quite what I was hoping for...,"As an engineer contemplating a career change into the theme park industry, I was hoping for some good leads and background information to help me in my search. However, the book was way too general to be of much value for this. There is a listing of several companies in the industry, including addresses, phone numbers and contact names, which will be helpful, but all that information (minus the names) is also available on some of the industry association's web sites. The 144 pages is deceiving, as the type is large and there are several pages of references. It only took me about 1.5 hours to read the whole thing. If you are looking for general information about what theme park engineering is, this book will be good for you. It is written for the high school and perhaps college age student, not for the serious job searcher."
1,Disappointing...,"It stopped working after a year of occasional usage. I thought it's do to the failure of bulb. But after replacing the bulb, it didn't work again. I called the customer service and they said there is no repair center for that and they just provide the parts of this device. At the end, even the electrician couldn't fix it."
1,Amazon's Shipping of this product renders it useless,"The bulb that was included with this lamp was broken. It was very poorly shipped, with no protective wrapping. Obviously this rendered the lamp useless. Rather than replace the entire item, I ordered a replacement bulb from amazon, which also came broken. I called amazon to see what I could do about getting a functional bulb, and they recommended that I send back the lamp and original broken bulb, as well as the second broken bulb for a refund. They furthermore recommended that I purchase the item elsewhere as they could not guarantee that they could send a functional bulb. Needless to say, this was a huge waste of my time. If amazon themselves recommend that this item be purchased elsewhere, I would highly recommend you stay away from ordering this product here."
5,Easy on the eyes,"This is a desk lamp, not meant to light a room. The light is easy on the eyes and plenty bright enough to see your work."
3,Barely adequate light,"The quality of light from this lamp is quite good. The quantity is lacking. This lamp should emit a great deal more light to justify the price. Do not buy this lamp unless you only need light is a very small, defined space."
2,You're on your own,"I have an earlier version of this light. Nice for reading, but the bulb is no longer available. The company stopped making them, and now I have a fifty dollar lamp that I can't use."
2,Returned this Item,"The Desk Lamp was not what I expected. I thought it was the same asa SAD light. It was not, so I returned it. Nice looking tho."
2,Pricey and actually made my eyes hurt more,"To start, I have no doubt that many people find this lamp reduces eye strain and makes working at a desk more comfortable.That said, this lamp actually makes my eyes and head hurt even more. It may be due to the lighting in my office; something about that lighting interacts with the light from the lamp. The light in my office is a combination of incandescent and fluorescent. If you have that combination in your office, this light may not be for you.The lightbulbs that come with this lamp aren't as ""real sunshine"" as I've seen in other lamps.The lamp is also prohibitively expensive. For the price, it's simply not worth it IMO. You may want to instead try a regular desk lamp and insert a full-spectrum lightbulb."
4,fun game,This is a fun game. First played it with some friends who had it. I looked around for it and finally found it.
4,"Shouldn't work, but does...","Their English is terrible. Their music's crude. And somehow, they're endearing. It's like a friend's garage band. In spite of everything, you can't help but like the songs. They're energetic, often very funny (perhaps unintentionally), and there's a hint of Buddy Holly's ironic dorkiness. In lighter songs, their accents border on parodic, but strangely they don't interfere with the more angsty songs. I still can't believe that a good musician like Hakan Hellstrom plays with them though."
2,The adapter heats very quickly,"When the adapter arrived I plugged it into my car's appropriate socket, I selected 19 volt voltage and it started charging my Asus laptop (K62IC), but the problem is that it heats so that you can't touch it, after an hour of work the adapter's connector started to melt. In short I'm not satisfied with the product mostly because of the abnormal heat."
3,"Robert E Kowalski , R.I.P.","This book is certainly well written which is to be expected since Kowalski was a medical journalist, and his program has helped some. I use the past tense because nowhere in these reviews do I find the information that Kowalski died suddenly in November 2007 of a pulmonary aneurysm at the relatively young age of 65. Kowalski's online newsletter has been discontinued. It is curious that the regular physicals and special medical monitoring Kowalski describes in his book did not reveal this problem. Pulmonary aneurysms are rare, but not undetectable. Kowalski cited the results of those tests as proof his program worked, and it appears the program addressed the most obvious of Kowalski's circulatory problems, but it is just as obvious that Kowalski's doctors missed the boat, with tragic results. Just goes to show that now matter how determined one is, no matter how disciplined one is, fate has a way of stepping in."
1,Talk to your doctor instead of wasting $ on this book,"This book does nothing but help the author make a quick buck by playing on people's fears. I *am* a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol, but I think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor (hopefully you have a good doctor) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process. This book has some ""common sense"" information but also a lot if misinformation, such as the stuff on supplements. None of them has been shown to really work! Don't waste your money. Talk to your doctor first, and be sure to find out if your parents also have high cholesterols and let your doctor know."
1,full of fallacies,Someone recommended this. I wish I had never bought it. Waste of money and time.It was full of fallacies and facts twisted around to suit the author's own internal beliefs.He jumps from one incident to another based on the most tenuous links to make his case.I don't recommend this book to anyone.
4,unknown in chicago,"I read the book and I read the bible I went to Deuternomy the28th chapter, I read the blessing and the curse, and it wouldappear that Israel is under the curse not the blessing. And ifDaniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Jesus is to be beleived the Nationof Israel should remain in captivity untile Jesus come back toset-up is kingdom on earth. Most of the people who are proclaiming themselves to be Jew are mostly European or biblicalknown as Gentile (see Genesis 10th chapter). If this too hardto believe just compare their (Europeon Jews) history to whatto what happened to the true children of Israel. I always wonderwhy out of the 12 Tribe of Isreal meaning there is Reuben, Simeon, Levi,Judah and so on they can find only one tribe out of 12? According to history the last known tribe was taken out in 70Ad. God, said the 12 tirbes will not be back until he's coming. So, my questinion is who those people in the Holy Land?"
2,Interesting but inaccurate,"While Koestler presents an intriguing theory and a well written book, there is absolutely no credibility to his ideas. No serious historian will use his book when researching the history of Eastern European Jews. For example the vast majority of the Jews in that area were not converts from Khazaria but rather moved into Eastern Europe from Germany and other Central European countries. That this book is even considered serious to some is a disgace of history. Not that Koestler is entirely incorrect. There was a country called Khazaria and its leaders did convert to Judaism, and there are most likely Jews today who came from Khazarian ancestry, but frankly there the known facts end. This may have well been historical fiction. Hopefully one day someone with a famous name will write a book that tells the truth about Jews in the area."
4,Regardless Of All The Arguments...,"Koestler researches and documents the history and culture of an obscure but quite fascinating Turkic tribe. Arguing over who are ""true"" Jews is not only irrelevent but silly and shows an ignorance of the history and religion of the Hebrew peoples.Hebrews and Jews were a heterogeneous lot long before the Khazars arrived on the historical scene and adopted Judaism as their religion."
3,Interior problems with Samsung,I too noticed bubbling under the turntable. At first I though liquid had boiled over the plate and got underneath causing a buildup. But after inspecting the surface I noticed that the paint was bubbled. With the wheels rotating over them the paint blistered and broke open. The microwave operates ok. But I am not comfortable not knowing if further damage is being done. Or if its safe at all. I am in the process of contacting the company about it. I have had it for two years and don't think they will do anything about it. I'll keep you posted. I'd buy another if I was sure it would hold up as expected. There is a interior paint problem with these.
1,A guest,"We received this microwave as a wedding gift in Sept of 2000. The microwave had be working just great until 7/21/03 when I was defrosting some meat. The microwave started making popping noises and sparks turned into a flame of fire. The fire came from that little opening on the right upper side within. I immediately put the fire out informed my husband and the microwave was trashed. We were really shocked at this happening because had I not been in the kitchen to see this, the fire could have escalated bigger. I rated one star because this makes this microwave unpredictable. If you buy the Samsung make sure you are in the area at all times you use it!"
5,Great Little Microwave for the Price.,"I was looking for a cheap ... microwave and took an chance on this one because it had the ""carousel"" type of mechanism. There are other microwaves that I have used that don't have this and claim not to need it, but I always find annoying cold-spots in the food because of it. That said, this one has been quite good a reheating leftovers, which is my primary use for the unit. It also has some pre-programmed common settings which so far have proved to be on the money. For example, you can press the ""reheat pizza"" button and it reheats a slice or two to perfection.I've been using it for about a week now and must say that I have yet to have a bad experience with it. I would highly recommend it to people who are looking for a moderately priced microwave for reaheating leftovers (I still feel that it is a sin to actually COOK something in a microwave)."
1,Definitly NOT worth the money,"I bought this microwave after deciding to retire my old one of TEN years. Yep, ten years.It worked fine for a couple weeks, then it started shutting itself off when it overheated. So, we can use it for approx. 3 minutes at a time.I need to contact Samsung because I didn't keep the box or receipt. I never expected a microwave to this.I'll update you on how their customer service responds."

4,billy bob is KOOL!,Easy to learn - easy to play - lots of fun.Drive a boat - 4-wheeler - shoot game & fish.
2,good graphics and sound but not much else,"Billy Bob for GBC is unique---definitely tongue-in-cheek humor aimed at those redneck types. Truth be known, Billy Bob is extremely playable-----for about 20 minutes. Then you come to the uncomfortable realization that there is nothing else to the game, and you swear off buying anymore games for a 2 inch screen.Stay away from this one kids."
3,wrong colors sent,"I received the wrong colors however my dad liked them anyways for his fathers day gift, that would be the only reason i didn't complain. They are comfortable though and he seems to like them."
2,For $30 it's OK,"Just a few points. You get 2 16 meg cards but only one slot so you have to keep swapping cards. It's not like the Diamond Rio that can store 2 cards at once. FM feature is a plus. The instructions are very skimpy and poor. The software will crash Explorer if you pull the card out while Explorer is open. For about $30 net of rebate, it's a good buy but not a great one. You get what you pay for."
3,Four Bike Storage Rack,"I have 2 adult & 2 kid bikes on the rack. It does hold up, but just realize that it's a non-secured / stand-alone rack, so there are x-y-z axis movements. Hindsight, I would have built a wall mounted bike rack that would be sturdier."
3,Watch out for shipping,The product was damaged during shipping so I had to hammer the supports together with a wrench and hammer to get it to fit together. The product would have gotten great reviews four plus stars from me if the product was not damaged during shipping. .
4,Make sure you can playback a PAL DVD...,Make sure you can playback a PAL DVD... otherwise you will have to go through extra hoops to watch it.
2,"Very beautifuly written book, and yet...","I find that this novel is about a loser in life and I cannot stand reading about losers. Simply, the main character Gamliel had a ""mild"" experience as compared to others who survived the war. And yet for some reason Elie enjoys writing about losers in life who are searching for love, never happy, busy or accomplished. There is more to life than that and certainly more to Judaism.Elie is at his best when he writes non fiction about real people such as in Souls on fire, Sages and Dreamers. It is a real shame that he wrote more novels than non fiction works and yet there is still time to rectify that... and yet...BG"
5,Gardenias: A Novel,"I couldn't put this book down, as was the case with it's prequil, The Cape Anne. Gardenias is a great journey through the lives of real characters. Their dreams, loves and heartaches are made tangible by Ms. Sullivan's ability to write, with clarity, in her raw and gripping style. You will fall in love with Lark, the child through whom this world is lived. You will become acquainted with the perplexing nature of humans in their struggles to find happiness."
2,Dead weight,"It's shiny and nice looking and worked for exactly three months after which it became a shiny and nice looking dead weight. I substituted it with Hamilton Beach 80365 model and it is much better (and keeps working for the past 8 months with no problem).I initially chose Mr Coffee because I thought that manual grinding control would work better for my french press, which requires very coarse grinding. However, I found that Hamilton Beach model has just the right dial in for automatic grinding which still leaves coarseness. Besides, it is also significantly easier to empty and wash.One little advice - try looking for the coffee grinder in your local Wall-Mart. These very same grinders are on the shelves and at lower price then what Amazon is charging. And if the grinder does not work for you, it is less hustle to return it to the store vs shipping it back at your expense to Amazon."
2,Book review,I origionally thought this was a good book till I had to pay attention to the references and realized they were to a totally different book. I would have bought this as a partner to another book had I known but now it is too late and have to study from a much older version. The questions and rationales are great but the education is elsewhere.
5,A gem,"This book is perfect. It has plot, it has characters, it has science that makes sense, it has politics that makes sense, and it has one perfect moment at the end that I would describe if I could, but describing it would spoil it.Read this book and anything else Michael Swanwick ever wrote. He is that good."
5,WONDERFUL,"Just starting out using Guided Imagery for reducing stress and relaxation...and this CD is easily the best I have tried so far. The imagery and music work together for a wonderful and ""peaceful"" experience. If you want to get started with Guided Imagery start with this CD (but you may be spoiled after listening). Hope Closet Mystics make more like this... I will be sure to be in line to get another. Thanks..."
5,This CD is extremely pleasant and relaxing...,Great natures sounds and woman's voice that goes well with the sounds & music. I have been listening to this every night since I received it and it puts me right to sleep. Love it! You will not be disappointed!
4,pretty decent,"Works as expected, as easy as any similar socket to wire up.Note the protruded socket ring shown here is optional, so this can be mounted with a flush face (much cleaner looking IMHO) or with less rearward projection (say, on an RV wall) at your preference. I put mine through a cabinet wall behind a stereo, so removed the extension cylindar and don't have to have a 'nose' sticking out when nothing is plugged in."
2,Looks like the original but...,"I'm a little conflicted with this product. It is a bigger version of Ralph Lauren Blue, it even smells the same BUT this fragrance does not last nearly enough as the original. When I purchase this fragrance from Macy's I can gaurauntee that one spray will last all day. With this duplicate your lucky if it lasts a couple of hours."
2,Polo Blue By Ralph Lauren For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Oz.,"Product fragrance was ""watery""; it didn't penetrate like it should have. Scent did not last more than 30 minutes or so."
5,the price is right by zocchi666,witchfinder general is not your typical vincent price horror film . price sheds the over the top camp here for a truly twisted performance . a gritty somber tale of a traveling inqusitor bend on self gratification thru torture and accusation. while i love price in classics of the genre like house on haunted hill or masque of the red death this film should not be overlooked . price is an easy target for those throwing stones at the genre but see him here and you will truly feel the power of his acting full on. a must !!!!!!!
3,Vincent Price Fan,"I love Vincent Price Movies.He was truly a talented actor who could effortlessly scare the stuffing out of you.Sadly this is not one of his better filmsIt is however a great study of mob mentality & how fear can make you turn on friends and loved ones.The stand out actor was Mr.PriceHis characterzation of ""The Witchfinder General"" was a pitch perfect depiction of a greedy self serving amoral pompus individual capable of doing anything to further his own desires."
1,Badly engineered,As several others have stated this thing is pure junk. The bucket did leak and the instructions do advise to soak it ahead of time. Thats crazy. The process requires melted ice water to fill the bucket to transfer the cold and also to prevent the ice from freezing to the inner metal can. It will not freeze correctly with out it (also in the instructions)BUT... my main gripe is the poor design of the paddle to socket connection. The paddle shaft is aluminum and mine (like several others here) stripped out on the very first use as the connection is too short to properlly engage the scocket. The result was metal shavings from the rounded off shaft in the ice cream and hard freeze around the outside with liquid in the center as the paddle was stuck.I did follow all supplied instructions. This is simply a poorly designed product. If I could give it 0 stars I would!
1,don't bother!!,"I BOUGHT THIS ICE CREAM MAKER AND EXPECTED IT TO BE A GOOD INVESTMENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLEASED WITH ""RIVAL"" AS A BRAND.IT ""LEAKS""!!!THE 1st AND ONLY TIME I USED IT: IT DID NOT SLOW DOWN OR STOP AFTER 47 MINUTES. WHEN I CHECKED THE ICE CREAM WAS SOMEWHAT HARD ON THE BOTTOM BUT THE MOTOR WAS STRIPPING THE METAL AND THROWING THE METAL PIECES INTO THE CANISTER OF ICE CREAM MIXTURE.NEVER GOT EVEN 1 BATCH OF ICE CREAM!!!!IT IS NOT USABLE AFTER ONLY 1 ATTEMPT TO MAKE ICE CREAM!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad for the money.,"I purchased this ice cream freezer about 3 months ago, and have made 10 batches of ice cream. Everything has worked as advertised, except one time when the dash slipped out of the slot it fits in and the ice cream was frozen only around the sides of the can. The machine ran for 45 minutes, and I finally just shut it down. I wish that the motor was a bit stronger so that the ice cream would freeze a little harder. It seems to stop too soon for me. I am worried that the dash problem may come back to haunt me, but for now it is working. I do have to pay close attention to everything being down and tight in the bucket.One other thing; Forget about the recipes for vanilla that come with the maker. The old fashioned vanilla recipe is horrible. Use your own recipe."
4,Very nice,"These lights are very nice compared to what you will get at the home improvement stores for the same price. The only problem with them, as others have mentioned, is the shoddy paint work. Mine have bare spots showing. I will touch them up because I like the style and want to keep them. The wrinkled glass is a nice touch but don't expect it to hide the fact that you are using ugly CFL's. I ended up using pointed style incandscents to give them the classy look. The aluminum is very thick as is the glass. I bought seven total (post & wall) to go around my house."
4,Target honored warranty: still happy,"This inexpensive espresso machine does an impressively good job.After using it about a dozen times, it went belly-up. Why? The reservoir cap valve broke - apparently the same thing that breaks in most people's units.I took the cap back to Target with my receipt and they handed me a new one. Voila, back in business.My advice: keep your receipt, and read the warranty expiration, ONE YEAR. If it breaks, replace the broken part under warranty and ""party on, Wayne""."
4,Sometimes you get more than you pay for,"Considering the cost of other expresso and cappuchino makers, I thought that was a reasonable first time try. I noticed the reviews it had been given, many of them not so complimentary, and took a chance - what's money compared the the cost of all those frozen coffees I'd been buying! Nice surprise. Other than the incorrect directions of not packing the coffee in the basket, this little machine does good. The most important thing I found is to use GOOD expresso. Some dark roasted bean is not an option. Also, try a little cocoa in the coffee basket - binds the coffee to the water for a really smooth treat. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is that is doesn't have an auto turnoff, and my basket is a little difficult to seat."
4,Lovin it,"In the past 2 years my husband and I have gone through 3 KRUPS machines (moderately priced models). The second one went out after only 4 1/2 months. We received the melitta for Christmas this year. I have to say my first impression is ""WOW, I'm impressed"". This little machine rocks. The frothing tool is considerably more powerful than my past machines. I took the advice of several reviewers and warmed the milk in the microwave while the machine brewed the espresso. Prior to the end of the brew cycle I began to froth the milk. Within seconds the milk was frothed and STEAMING hot. I never had results like this with my more expensive machines. The machine is compact.. easy to clean and powerful. The espesso is also stronger than with my KRUPS.I know this isn't a professional strength machine but it definantly has the competition beat when it comes to price and performance.I will write again after I have owned it for several months and can give a more complete performance review."
2,Deplorable Show ... OK cd,"""We Will Rock You"" did well in London, and with my love for Queen music, I purchased this cd & awaited its arrival in Las Vegas.Let's just say that the producers were smart to skip New York ... the show was absolutely terrible!The ""live"" cd (taken from a London performance) is ok, many tracks even enjoyable.But with Queen's excellent catalog of music, you're better off buying their cds. Try ""A Night At The Opera"", ""News Of The World"" or ""Innuendo""."
2,"""I e-mail like a Baroness?""","The disc was mediocre up to this line, then the bottom fell out. I am fan of Queen, that's the only reason this get's more than one star. The music is awkwardly shoe-horned into the story, with some lyrics re-written to fit better (ie ""Radio Ga-Ga"" and the already mentioned butchering of the classic ""Killer Queen""). The vocal talents are good but sound... off with this material. While any Queen is better than no Queen sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone."
1,Don't waste your money......,"After reading others reviews, I really didn't think rock salt could be that bad. All the other reviews are correct. The rock salt in this bag is the same quailty of the rock salt you buy from your local hardware store (dirt and rocks included). If you are buying this because it says ""ice cream"" on the label - Save your money and use your left over salt from winter."
2,not worth the cost of shipping,I added this to my cart as a last minute purchase and the shipping cost 4X the price of the salt!
2,it's not very good,"it's not the stories it's just what kind of proof the author has that the stories are true or false. it disappointed me. with the other reviews i thought that it would be a really good book, but it wasn't all that good."
3,Disappointing,"We started with Clifford The Big Red Dog. This one isn't as enjoyable. It has several pages of disastrous deeds that Clifford does. Not a very positive book for young children.I would have rated it 2 stars, except the 3rd start goes for an adult clifford instead of the babyish one I've seen in other books of the series."
2,clifford's good deeds,"The description said that it was a hard cover book, but it almost the same as soft cover and it is looking dirty. Thanks"
2,Disappointing,"I wanted the entire, uncut wedding, not a news broadcast. This is interesting for fans of Diana, but disappointing to those of us who remember that day and would like to remember it in its entirety."
5,Excellent News Reel!!,"This dvd was very infrmative, it brought me back to that time of hope and inocence the the young Diana on her wedding day. ABC did this very tastefully and well documented. Its a best of...but I will always treasure it. Highly recommended"
5,Big Hit!,"I gave this to my brother in law at a family get-together, and he and my stepdad were playing the songs right away. The next time I saw him, he was practicing more from the book. They like to take this when they go camping so they can play around the fire, and it's also good for teaching his daughter how to play."
3,no free shipping,"I was going to buy this based on the great reviews, but then I found out that it doesn't qualify for free shipping because it is sold through Target. Too bad. No sale."
5,Worth Every Penny,"With four children constantly making hot cocoa and instant oatmeal, the microwave was really getting a beating. Plus it is overhead, meaning the children had to reach up to get hot items out of the microwave. I decided a kettle (away from the stove) would grant them independence and me a little peace of mind. This kettle is by far the nicest one I've ever owned. I really shopped around (my last one was a dismal failure, only heating about half a teapot full of water at a time and lacking an auto shut-off). I love how it sits easily on the little electric connector and the light that indicates it is operating is very handy too. It makes a pleasant little ding (not very loud at all) when the water reaches boiling and it shuts off by itself. The water heats up very quickly too. I highly reccommend this item!"
3,Good read.,Took a little time to get going in the beginning. Was worth it in the end though. All in all a great book.
2,My body language after reading? (Shrug)!,"The best thing about this book is that it's short, and wasn't needlessly padded, as so many other books like this would be. Even at just under 300 pages, and after needing only a couple of days to finish, it seemed longer...not a good sign.Another story that does OK with 'witty banter' betwen the lead characters, but offers no real depth or substance. Just enough predictably hokey things happen to set up the predictably hokey ending, and presumably they both live hokily....uh, happily ever after!"
2,Not up to par,"Definitely a disappointment after reading her Seal series, which I absolutely love. I hope Ms. Brockmann gets back to the Seal team soon."
4,Used Juiceman Juicer daily for the past 10 years,"I have been juicing now for 10+ years and have only used this Juiceman Jr. I have faithfully juiced daily. I find I have more energy and seem to be healthier since juicing. I have juiced spinach, kale, carrots, celery, cantalopes, grapefruits, oranges, apples, pears, and watermelon. This juicer works up to top notch standards. My only issue is that the inside of the juicer where the screen is that it stains. Otherwise my 10+ year experience with the Juiceman Jr. is tops on my list."
1,Breaks Easy - No Replacement Parts,"This is a feather weight, my daughter was using it and where you put the vegatables in broke. I have been searching for a replacement cover and can't find who the manufacturer is to get a replacement."
2,By far not the best,"I enjoyed this gadget for couple of times and now it is collecting dust! It has many problems. Juicing pineapple is one of them... the worst part of this item is the clean up, often when I want to juice I think about the clean-up and use some other method, sometimes even the blending and straining is easier!"
1,Don't Waste Your money,"This is a piece of Junk juicer. I thought since My family had used Juiceman Jr juicers in the passed that this was a nice Juicer. However, the first one we recieved from another online store the juicer came broken on the bottom. We had this since September or so however , we put the juicing up until just a few weeks ago when we wanted to have juice to get better. So I went to Juice some apples, carrots and lemon's an hour ago. The Juicer choped the white pusher thing and then my husband relised that the bottom of this one is broken. If you want a Juicer get a top of the line juicer."
3,Not really what I expected,"This book has some good information on how to introduce your new baby to the dog, but it's pretty limited and most of the information is common sense in my opinion, but I do a lot of research on subjects so this could be different for you."
1,What's up with these guys?,"What company takes two weeks- maybe more- to ship an item? Unless this item is being shipped from Hong Kong, were it was probably assembled, nothing in the United States of America should take that long, I don't care if this company is using a second, third or fourth party vendor. Amazon.com states that ""your account will not be charged until the item has shipped"" Not true, people. My account was pre-authorized-the money taken out of my account- for the amount of this product when purchased.I purchased this product on 8/17/10. I am being told I will receive it, maybe on 8/30/10 or, perhaps, on 9/8/10 (?????)Wow."
5,Double Take Leather Jacket,"this jacket looks fancy and very descent with amazing affordable prize, pure leather and perfect for winter it will really protect you from cold, a little heavy but its alright for me."
4,Good flow without much noise,"I bought this dryer to replace a Revlon Quiet Ceramic model. I am a male with short, straight hair and a new ostomy which requires me to wear a large bandage-like appliance on my abdomen. I can shower with it on, but it takes some effort to get dry.The Revlon dryer was nice and quiet but didn't have much air flow. This Conair has much more forceful flow without much more noise. It has three temperature settings - the hot and cool are okay, but I wish warm were a little warmer. I can dry my hair and appliance in about three minutes instead of five before. The weight is a little more than some dryers but nothing extreme; it feels sturdy. I haven't noticed any effect of the ionizer button and haven't tried the attachments."
4,Finally Found,"My hair is VERY thick and long, and requires a lot of maintenance. It is naturally wavy, but I find it to be more manageable when I straighten it - so I do so every time I wash it. I needed a hair drier that I could use to straighten my hair effectively as I dry it. Sounds easy, but I have tried many different hair driers and none have the power to keep my hair straight that way. This conair 213X Infiniti does the job well. When I straighten my hair with it as I dry it, I barely need to use my hair straightener afterwards - and it will stay straight until the next time I wash it. The only downside is it is still too heavy for me to hold long enough to do my hair, so my wonderful husband often gets roped into helping me."
3,A GOOD VALUE,"A great product for the price. It has performed above my expectations. It is slightly heavier than what I was accustomed to, but, that really hasn't been troublesome. The control buttons are another item that I had to get used to. Dries hair very quickly."
3,Product is ok,"This blow dryer is ok. Doesn't seem to get hot hot just warm. Also, a bit on the heavy side. It does not have a retractable cord either, which is a feature that will be a ""must"" on my future dryer."
5,Conair Ceramic Hair Styler 213XP,"Great hair dryer and styler for straight or curly hair.Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black"
4,Great hairdryer - not-so-great attachments,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. It is slightly heavier than her previous model, but getting used to the new model was easy. It works quickly, isn't too loud, but my sister says the attachments are a bit of a pain. If you need to use the attachments on a daily basis, this might not be the right model for you. Other than that - GREAT hairdryer."
3,Not the best for curly hair,"I was very disappointed with this dryer. I have curly hair (I never straighten it) and the diffuser that came with the dryer is terrible. Air still blows very hard through the diffuser and it blows my hair everywhere, creating a lot of frizz. I've ordered another diffuser to use with this dryer, so hopefully that will solve the problem.Also it doesn't get as hot as other dryers and although I like that, I can see how that would be a problem for some people."
2,Too heavy and unbalanced!,"This dryer is not for people with small hands or problems with their wrist. It is very heavy, unbalanced and the handle is not hand-friendly. While I have no problems with the way this dryer dries, the its weight makes it very uncomfortable to use. I have short hair and it doesn't take long to dry my hair, but even then I could feel the strain in my wrist. And it felt like when you were holding it, it kept wanting to fall forward, toward the nozzle, so that puts even more strain on the wrist. I don't have wrist problems, but I imagine those that do would have an extremely uncomfortable time with this drier. A shame, as I like the settings and it does the drying job well."
3,Get a workout and dry shiny hair at the same time,"PROS: Dries fast, leaves hair shiny, several setting combos, long cord.Cons: Way too heavy, cool button gets pushed accidentally because of its location.I don't think it dries hair extremely fast but then again I do have lots of thick hair. If the cool shot button was moved and they took some weight off of this big boy then it would be a great hair dryer."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair dryer!!","I had used an ionic styler in the past but was not that impressed. This hair dryer may be slightly heavy, but the results make you forget all about that. It leaves my hair without frizz even on the dampest of days and oh, what a timesaver... my hair used to take 20 minutes to dry and now it takes just 10!!!"
2,"Not for Thick, Coarse Hair","MoFarmer's Wife: This dryer's heat isn't nearly hot enough to dry thick, coarse hair. It blows too hard, even on low speed. The low speed doesn't allow for styling while drying, blows my hair all over the place, and actually creates tangles when my hair is long enough. I just bought a Chi to replace this one. Hope I can sell it at consignment!"
3,Hair dryer,This isn't as powerfull as it appeared to be by reviews. Only slightly more power then othere Conair models and other similarly priced brands.
3,A little disappointing...,"Almost all of the recipes in this book are for everyday items with mashed, pureed or crumbled tofu added; while the few things I've cooked have been good, I was hoping for some variety of method. The author only explores one way of using tofu, and for that reason I found the book a little disappointing."
4,Good Buy,I highly recommend this product. It's smells good and stands out from a lot of products out there. It was shipped promptly an recevied in good condition.
1,Not original!!!!!,"This item dont have a original wrapped and dont smell like the original perfum!!! Smell like alcohol. I used this perfum since 2008 and never have complein, im really know this frangance and this its not a original!!!! dont shop!!!"
2,Beautiful and Stunning but Missing the BIG Picture,This is a study of 5 people with very different backgrounds and they experience in the Holy Land. They go to a lot of the religious sites that we hear about in the Christmas Story.I thought this series was professionally done and the sites were just Beautiful.Never being to the Holy Lands or even seeing much pictures I so much appreciate being able to see this.I do think these films lacked a lot in the area of Scriptural Content.There were experts that would talk at times and I do not believe they were Spiritually accurate.I think it lacked a lot on telling the viewer about Jesus.I think it really missed out on showing the reality that we can have a REAL Relationship with Jesus.This film missed the BIG picture of presenting the Gospel Message and how to have a Salvation experience with Jesus.I received this Film from the Publisher for my Honest Review.
3,Too much detail?,"If you want detail this book has it; maybe too much detail. I have read over 100 books about WWII so I obviously like the topic but I found myself getting bogged down in the detail here. Pilot names, longitude, latitude - if you want to plot everything that happened you could do it with this book but it just is not that exciting. There are even times where you can see the author tried to enliven the narrative but it is not enough. For contrast on how one can be historically accurate and exciting try ""The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors"" by James Hornfischer. Or Winston Groom's ""1942"" or even Rick Atkinson's ""An Army At Dawn""."
1,Optical Character Recognition edition---full of typos and mistakes,"As you will find on the second page of the book, this edition is produced by using OCR technology on an old print. In fact, starting on the very first page you will immediately start to notice mistakes like random punctuation marks and wrong letters. The blurb claims that OCR allows cheaper books to be available, but Amazon's price on this edition is quite expensive for a 100-page paperback."
2,Bags are sort of okay,"These bags are the cheapest hard case saddlebags on the market and you pretty much get what you pay for. Installation is very easy, but that's it for this product's strengths. The locks are low quality and turn in different directions to lock for the right versus left side which makes no sense. The lids are flimsy and awkward to open if you have anything else in your hands. If someone wanted to bust open the lid they could with bare hands with very little effort. While nicely shaped from an aesthetic point of view, it is less practical for storage with some nooks and dead space in the rear portion. The screws for the lid hinges protrude and are not capped. These screws tear into your garments and scratche your stuff. If I had to do over I would have paid the extra premium and gone with hard bags from Corbin or Champion."
5,My 3 yr old loves it!!,"We checked this book out at the library and my 3 yr old loves it so much, I am ordering it for her for Christmas. She was so disappointed when we had to take it back to the library. She loves all of the jungle sounds and it is much more fun for the child if you really get into the sounds. A super book!"
1,Very difficult to control,"I bought one of these a number of years ago and have used it intermittently since then. I am now about to replace it with, I hope, a slow cooker that actually cooks food at the low setting, doesn't boil over at the high setting, and doesn't get so hot on the exterior. I will be looking for a non-Rival product because of the poor quality of this appliance. Note: I have not experienced the hardware problems of other reviewers."
5,I loved it!,"If you are a Genesis purist and hate their 80's popular music, don't get this video. On the other hand, speaking as a child of the 80's and a drummer, I think it's great. I loved Genesis's ABACAB and self titled stuff, which rocks at this concert. The dueling drum songs are way cool! The picture and sound quality seem good, certainly as good as you could expect for the time. The band is in top form, Phil Collins is an fantastic live singer."
5,BEST DTS mix I've ever heard!,Absolutely incredible audio quality in DTS.Abacab is just Mind Blowing on this dvd.Highly recommended; the only other two concert dvd's I havethat I listen to as much as this one is Peter Gabriel'sSecret World Live Tour and How the West was Wonby Led Zepphlin.I would rate this 10 stars if I could.
5,Another Great Live Show From Genesis,"Genesis, Live At Wembley Stadium is a excellent concert for the Invisible Touch tour. I usually don't but live DVD's but I make exceptions if I like the band or the songlists is really good. I like the concert in widescreen, its a good effect. Genesis is most definitly a live band, there live sound is excellent. My favorite part on the DVD was the ""Drum Duet"" between Phil Collins and Chester Thompson was excellent, it was cool to see Phil Collins just jam a little but it was cool that that made is a duet and Chester Thompson is a awesome drummer too. I also enjoyed the tour documentary, I think more live dvd's show include a tour documentary. I would like to see more Genesis DVD's be available in the future {""Three Sides Live"" and ""The Mama Tour""} and also a documentary on the whole history of the band and last but not least a video collection cause Genesis is a band that definitly deserves a video collection."
5,Good Old School Genesis!,"Sound was great on a 30,000 dollar system and video was so, so it does bounce around alot. Overall a must have for the collection. Check out Phil's Fairwell tour as well."
1,I returned it!!! I HAVE TO!,"I was so excited about making some ice creamso i ran to Target and get this little machine, it's small, but i think it's ok, im just making it for myself anywayit did not work! i can even make ice cream using plastic bags, but not with this machine that make LOUD NOISE!!!and before it really froze, the motor would stop, i guess its too hot or something, i'm not sure"
1,Worked well...3 times,"I received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times. BUT then, the base burst in my freezer, spewing foul scented goo all over. I contacted the manufacturer to ask how to get it replaced, and NEVER HEARD BACK. Apparently they don't care about backing up their product. Now I have to buy another one, and it won't be this brand."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this at a Target store and was very disappointed. The unit shut off after about 20 minutes and could not be restarted. I ended up with ""ice cream soup"" (yes, I did follow all instructions)and had to put it in my freezer for several hours to set. I will try the cuisinart next."
1,Rival Gourmet Creamery,I found this product way below standards. The ice cream didn't freeze at all. If you want a creamy milk shake then waste your money on this product.
1,Don't bother--it doesn't work well,"I did everything right and even almost froze the ice cream mix...and still only got slush. Given time in the freezer, I did get ice cream and the coffee ice cream recipe is great! But since you have to freeze the gel 24 hours, take 30 min to let it run...and then 3 hours to firm up in the freezer...forget it! Go with the ice and salt!"
4,No Hiding in The Shadows for this Lover!!,"Shadow lover was a well-written, emotionally gripping tale that had me hooked from the very beginning. It was not only romantic and sensual, but it also taught a very real lesson of life: The fact that the brightest treasure can come buried in crap and the most sparkling wrapping paper can cover the most horrendous of gifts! In other words, don't judge by appearances. The heroine of this engaging novel falls in love with the inner beauty of the hero, thereby making his scars and imperfections a non-concern.This author did a superb job with this book. I look forward to reading more from her in the years to come."
4,Even Yanks dig it!,"I discovered this band while watching ""bluetorch tv"" on fox sports net. I was immediately captivated by them. This is one fo those CD's where every track is listenable, and a few are just awesome. I reccomend it for good ""middle of the road"" listening. Not too hard, not too soft. Nice melodic rock, catchy lyrics, with an occasional edge. I REALLY wish they would come to America, but not bloody likely!!Also, check out their website: superjesus.com.au"
5,TOMTOM0NE LEATHER CARRYCASE,PROVIDES EXCELLENT PROTECTION FOR THE TOMTOM UNIT. FITS VERY WELL AND IS EASY TO TRANSPORT
4,"Sugary, Sweet, and Fun for the Family","This movie really was like something you'd get off of the Hallmark channel or ABC Family. It was sugary, sweet, and often overly simple. Still Bell had an amazing performance and I found myself really getting into the story and a little sad when it ended. This movie is great for kids and makes and excellent family movie night."
5,Very sweet family movie!,"Catherine Bell (JAG, Army Wives) shines again on another project. CB just shows that she can do it all-first action -adventure, drama, and now romantic comedy! This time she plays Cassie, a sweet and mysterious young woman who moves into a town run by a stuffy wife of the mayor. Cassie teaches about tolerance and looking at yourself in a postive way. Very strong message for kids. My niece and nephew loved it and ask when will there be a sequel! As does their aunt! Buy it- wont be disappointed!!"
5,GREAT relaxing movie,"This was a great movie. You feel happy the entire time while watching. It has a little bit of everything for any age group. Great for the entire family! Great movie to fall asleep to if you've seen it several times because it has that ""feel good"" vibe to it. I wish they would release the Good witches garden on dvd!! The latest one on Hallmark the Good witch's gift was just as good. All three movies are GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,What the heck!?!,Add me to the list of the disappointed. Nice stories for kids. Can not believe they would stop producing these movies. It would be interesting to know why. You can still purchase movies that are not 1/2 as good as these two....so what was it?
5,Fun View,The Good Witch Movies are a fun night for families. It can start some good discussion about how we can relate to each other and with each other. It is a good story without going overboard.
5,"""The Good Witch"" with Catherine Bell","All 5 movies concerning ""The Good Witch"" with Catherine Bell are fun and wholesome for the whole family. When will all of them be available for purchases? I would love to purchases a whole (5) set of this movie."
4,Easy for parent or toddler to use,"The soft tip and medium size spoon bowl made it perfect when first introducing solids. The curved handle makes it easier for parent to hold when feeding. Now my toddler likes to feed himself, and has trouble with spoons that are too short or too long-- this one is just right. The only issue that stopped me from giving it five stars is that the spoon bowl is shaped more oval than round, which can push the food easily up onto the handle when feeding. Except for that, this spoon would be perfect."
4,Fight Team Rocket. Again! Again!,"This is a fine way to enjoy playing with the Pokemon characters with small children (even my 4 year old), without the complicated trading card rules. The game takes you through a 2-3 hour scripted adventure story with lots of Pokemon battles (sort of a friendlier Dungeons and Dragons for preschoolers) using simplified big print Pokemon character cards. However, keep in mind that small kids like to hear the same story over and over -- which is important because there is only one story in the box and they will expect you to play it again. And again. Hence the durability rating."
4,Intelligent Suspense,"I would agree with the four/five star reviews in that the film was a twisty, thought challenging love triangle suspense with a largely unexpected and well acted and scripted storyline. However, with the four star reviews as opposed to the five star reviews the main criticism was ""suspension of belief"" which for them was a plot that was a little too perfect and polished, especially with all the complicated counters thrown-in meant to lead the viewer off track. It was just a little too unlikely a perfect crime storm to be believable. Entertaining none the less.The film's thoughtful plot intrigue reminded me of the very different supernatural film ""The Caller"" where, there too, you are continuously being led into asking questions about the most improbable sequence of events."
1,Not worth it,"This didn't even last a month before it broke. I nearly lost my license plate, had I not noticed that it was barely hanging on. Don't waste your money on this, I would give it zero stars if I could."
3,Easy it Install!,I bought this for the front of my 2009 Toyota Prius! It was easy to install and looks great. The only issue is it did not come with washers. I had trouble getting it to stay without them. Lucky I had some that would fit.
2,Too Long for Toast,"I bought this toaster on clearence for a nice low price, so I shouldn't complain, but I do want people to know that it takes a long, long time to make toast. I am a patient person, but when I am making toasted sandwiches for my family, it just takes too long."
4,Bagel workhorse,"We've been using this toaster nearly daily for 11 months. The morning ritual is to put the coffee on, walk to the corner for bagels + come home to toast them. The toaster does seem to take a bit longer than other toasters I've used, but it does a nice job with bagels and I'm just not in that much of a hurry in the morning for an extra minute to make a difference."
3,OK,I guess I lucked out and it lasted 5 years with this microwave oven. My parents had an old one that i originally had that lasted about 15 years. I guess they don't make them like they used to
2,You get what you pay for..we got it for free so...,My husband & I received this Emerson Microwave as a wedding present. It occasionally shut off for extended periods of time. It hummed very loudly. At times it would make loud sparking noises even when there was microwave safe dishes being heated. It lasted for 1 1/2 yrs. One day I was heating up water for tea & it wouldn't get anything hot. We replaced it with another brand.
1,Only if you want to replace it...,"After owning our last (giant) microwave for 15 years, we decided to replace it with a smaller microwave. After 3 months, it just stopped working. Their 1-800 helpline is a complete waste of time, with no service areas near (even in the large Atlanta market) or advice on how to repair the model. The lower price was not worth the hassle and I will not buy an Emerson product again."
1,"Miraculously, our house did not burn down","This microwave was used once for two minutes. On the second use at 3.5 minutes, I noticed smoke coming out. The plastic on the inside of the door was melted, as was the glass PROTECTIVE??? panel. The paint was burnt black and flaked off. The metal exterior was hot enough that we could not touch the microwave oven until it cooled down. What a freaking nightmare!!! The house smelled like burnt plastic and metal for hours. What a peice of junk. If only Target or Emerson would refund the time and gas to take this charred peice of metal and plastic back for a refund."
2,"Runs and runs, and then quits!","I got this Microwave from Target 2 years and 2 months ago and used it semi-regularly. After having it for only a month, my 4-year old even torched a piece of pizza inside of it and it still kept going. Just last week it quit heating things - no cooking, melting, boiling, defrosting, nothing. I've never heard the cracking that other people have described. My friends and family members have had their microwaves for years, even up to a decade or more! Is this one, by brand or by design, really that inferior to everything else? I was hoping that this is a case of perhaps a fuse needing to be replaced. Sadly, my daughter will end up with the fanciest ""play microwave"" in my subdivision. If you want to replace your microwave in 2 years, I recommend this item."
1,Unreliable,"Sept. 27, 2003. Took this microwave home three-months ago thinking the Emerson name would be dependable. How wrong I was. The microwave performed well for the first couple months and then one day just stopped heating. Yes, appliances do break. But after three-months? It was only used about once a day. Spend your money on a Sharp, Samsung, GE, Panasonic, Kenmore or any other top performer. This Emerson microwave is a dud. Shop around."
5,Aint This Good News,"I would like to commend Motown for this CD. At last you have an Anthology that features leads by all original Supremes. Mary Wilson does lead on ""The Tears"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"". The Fabulous Florence Ballard does the lead on ""Buttered Popcorn"" (their 2nd single) and Ain't That Good News"" ( one of the best songs on the this collection). On this version of ""Good News"" the fade out is much longer and she really blows on this one as only she could. ""Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart"" is wonderful, in fact this version With more Flo and Mary on the fade out would have charted higher. Again Miss Flo rips into ""You Keep Me Hangin On"". Lastly this version of Diana's ""Someday We'll Be Together"" is the best. The sound quality is excellent. I am satisfied. A real Supremes Anthology, which showcases them as they should be as a UNIT as a TEAM. THE SUPREMES."
3,THIS is 'remastering'?!,"It's hard to fault the music selection on this compilation, but the mono remastering of most of the tracks sounds incredibly harsh and distorted, especially on modern stereos. I don't think it's just a matter of readjusting your ears to the relative congestion of mono, either. If stereo mixes of these tracks are available it seems incomprehensible they haven't been utilised, or at least some explanation provided as to why mono mixes have been preferred; bugger the 'wall of sound'! No-one listens to transistor radios anymore!"
2,A great collection if you're not into stereo sound.,"This is a great package of Diana Ross & the Supremes (& Jean Terrell & the Supremes). It is unfortunate that only 4% of the songs have the stereo versions, even some of the Jean Terrell- led songs. I have an album of Diana/Supremes Greatest Hits in stereo, so I question why these versions did not appear on the CD."
3,"Great tracks, great package but.....","Beware - about 80% of this 2 CD compilation is in MONO (stereo versions of all the hits exist). Does this mean that all the Motown ""remasters"" of the Supremes will in future be mono (I assume taken from the 7"" single and not the stero album version)?"
5,Leaves a fresh clean scent,I've used this on my large dogs for almost ten years and really love it. Won't use anything else. The other products on the market smell too much like medicine. This leaves a fresh clean scent that lasts a few days. Never had to take the dogs to the vet for ear cleaning or infections.
5,A trip thru east Africa with Theroux...........,"""Dark Star Safari"" by Paul TherouxI confess, I got hooked on Theroux's travel books when I read ""The Old Patagonian Railway"", some 5 or 6 years ago. By now, I may have read them all. All of them are very good. This one, especially, since it is full of surprises that the world does not know about eastern Africa."
4,Nkosi Sikelele Africa,"I read this book while driving from Johannesburg to the equator and back. It was therefor very immediate for me. I normally find Paul Theroux a bit tedious but certainly not this one. His desciptions are compelling and he brings to life all the awful, sad things about Africa. I fear that this beautiful continent, with it's wonderful people will never be able to overcome their problems."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable travelogue,"Paul Theroux' Dark Star Safari is an engaging thougtful descripotion of the author's journey from Cairo to Capetown in 2000. He travels by bus, train, minivan, truck, riverboat and describes his encounters with chance meetings with people in all walks of life in each of the countries he visits. He is perceptive and often critical of the state of affairs in all the lands. He particularly chastises the aid and relief organizations who start idealized projects and often abandon them without reaching any meaningful goals. He compares the state of affairs in this trip with what he saw as a young Peace Corps volunteer and teacher in Malawi in the 1960s, and finds most institutions, including schools and infrastructure to have become deplorable in the intervening generation. His critial stance is convincing."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this vac to help pick up pet stains. If you clean the stain while it is fresh it does the job. However, the brushes are too soft and its hard to clean the lint off the thin suction bar. You have to use some elbow grease to get the stubborn stains off. Also, I have only had this for about 2 years and the the blue reservoir latch already broke. Dirt devil does not sell these parts and since the warranty expired this vac is now useless. I am seriously considering getting the Hoover steamvac jr. If the product did break so soon, I would have given it a 3."
1,THIS THING SUCKS-OR RATHER DOESN'T!!,"Has absolutely NO suction. Nada, Zip, Zilch. A worthless machine. Don't waste your money. I would rate it zero stars, but it would't let me!"
2,Good scrubber but terrible sucker....,"The unit is heavy, but nothing too unmanageable. The water resivoir is small and the button to spray the water is vaccum released. So after you press the button to squirt the water you have to wait for the stopper to gradually rise again so you can squirt again. SLOW.The scrubbing part works great and did well at working the carpet fibers to get out the stain. BUT, the sucking part was terrible. The carpet spot was very wet after several times over the spot. I don't think it gets a good ""seal"" while in sucking mode.I will return this product and look for something better.I did have high expectations as Dirt Devil has always had good products. Maybe after some fine tuning it will be better."
1,Cheap but useless,"I have bought many Dirt devil product before, and I love them all ( bagless upright vac & small hand held vac) , so I guess I was expecting too much, The machine does very little for spot or spills. it cannt even pick up the excess water that it spills. you have to fill up exact levelof water, or as soon you turn it on, the vac will ""flood"" the area near by the place you try to clean. :(..... I returned it the same day."
1,Don't waste your money......,"This machine has broken down on me 4 times during the warranty and twice on the extended warranty.Out of the 1 1/2 years I have owned it, I've had it in my possession approximately 1 month. (The other 17 months it's been in the shop!)I received it as a gift, and I can honestly say, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it!Save your money for a real cleaner, not a Knock-off of the good ones."
1,A horrible machine,"My husband and I bought this machine shortly after we got our basset hound puppy and we regret spending the money. It holds hardly any liquid, and when the tank gets full, the waste water sprays out of the vents on the side and gets all over you! It's really disgusting. It seems to me that with carpet cleaners, bigger is better. If you plan on using a carpet cleaner a lot, like we do, go with a larger machine. But whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!"
1,Shame on you Dirt Devil!,"Bad Product...poor design. Surprised that some people like this product. Broke the plastic catch to the blue solution container and this product is now useless...It never worked well to begin with. I purchased it after owning a cordless, thinking the corded would give more power...very wrong there. Very awkward to empty dirty water and fill solution. Not much power. Brushes are too soft...Pretty much everything everyone else who has posted a ""1 star"" has said has happened to us...We didnt have the problem with the wet carpet, but that is because we didnt saturate our carpet with cleaner before trying to suck up the water...Will be going out and buing another cordless type...probably will do more research than last time (wish I had read all these reviews on this one before I threw the money down the toilet) Hope this helps someone out there save some money, and maybe even help Dirt Devil reevaluate their product development :-)"
1,Threw it out!,"After totally using up two Bissell SpotlLifters, I thought I'd give one of these a try. After all, it has scrubbing brushes, right? So it should do a better job, right? Wrong! All the brushes do is swirl the spot around. The suction is horrible. I've had this thing for over a year and only used it two or three times because each time I do I swear I won't use it again. Well, it's here, and I just had apot to clean up. It just doesn't do the job... It's heavy and noisy and ineffective. I just threw it away and am ordering a new SpotLifter. It doesn't have automatic scrubbing brushes, but it has great suction and does the job perfectly! It's lightweight and coreless to boot!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This machine is very difficult to set up and use, the instructions stink, and it spits water all over the place when the tank is full! I never could get the nozzle to work properly, and that was right out of the box - brand new. I found the only way to get any use out of this think is to spray another brand spot cleaner (OxiClean or Spot Shot works WAY better than the detergent that comes with this cleaner), and then use the machine to scrub and vacuum the liquid out. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of money. I hate that I bought it."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this item over the similar bissell cordless cleaner, thinking this would be stonger due to it has a power cord. Boy was I wrong, this machine has no suction power.1. To clean your carpet you must first spray the area with the cleaning solution, this is done buy repeated pressing of the spray button (like on an iron).2. Then you can scrub the area with a rotating brush, which I found to be very stiff and not so impressive in removing the stains.3. Then you can begin your suction of the water/cleaning soloution. The suction power on this machine was horrible, it left my carpet soaked and of course still stained- actually I think the stain is now bigger, because it just spread around with all the water and no suction.Don't waste you money on this product!!"
2,"6,000 square feet...I don't think so!!!","Would someone please explain to me how this 25ft roll of tape can cover up to 6,000 sq ft??? Even cutting it into tiny pieces wouldn't cover that much space!!??"
3,doesn't work on woodpeckers,I placed 1' long ribbons to the siding area where the woodpeckers have been doing the most damage. I went out today(Sunday) and as I entered my house I heard the pecking noises and to my disappointment nine new holes. To be fair the area I placed the ribbon don't get much sun so I'm sure it won't work at all unless you have direct sun light on the ribbons.
1,"Sent without bearing screw, which is 'unavailable'","This is a nice looking router bit, but they sent it to me without the bearing screw. According to CMT's web site, the bearing screw is not available. I'm not happy."
5,good bit,This bit is good. What else can you say? It's either machined properly and sharp out of the box or it's a piece of garbage. This is as advertised. I buy CMT without hesitation.
2,"Irons well, but leaks like crazy","I paid more for this iron than I ever have, thinking I would get a ""professional"" iron. After just one year, the iron is leaking water out of the tank all the time. I would not recommend this iron."
4,Nice Iron,"This is a really nice iron! The controls are on the handle so that you don't have to reach under the handle. Does a really nice job, as close to a steam generator iron as one can get, without being one. The only problem with this iron is that it is heavy."
1,"FRIENDLY WARNING. DON""T BUY THIS GARBAGE","This iron worked only for the first four months and then started to spread brown fluid and ruined my cloths. I exchanged the iron in the store, but the next one did the same thing after another four month of use. I sent it for repair, which made things even worse since probably they did nothing to it. I called Rowenta but this people are complete ignorats and Customer Service is not helpful at all and it is pure waste of time and phone call. So if you have $140 and looking for the way to waste it buy this iron. It's real piece of garbage."
3,Not brilliant for what I need.,"Well I bought this iron based on all the other great reviews. However, I bought it mainly to iron my Calvin Klein bedding as my old iron was just awful. Anyway, this iron did a better job but the creases are so stubborn....Hence to say I am $126 out of pocket and still have creased bedding! If anyone has any tips I would LOVE to hear them!"
1,Do not buy it unless you can return it without penalty !!!,"LEAKS IMMEDIATELY FROM THE OPENING FOR THE WATER WHILE YOU IRON !!! Did anyone ever test it when it was being designed ? To make matters worse, I didn't buy it from Amazon, and can only return it for store credit minus restocking fee. And what am I going to do with this store credit ??? Buy another Rowenta iron ?"
1,Great Iron.....when it works.,"This Iron would be amazing if it was reliable. Right now I havent found an iron that compares, if I did I would switch to the competition. Ive gone through three Rowenta Perfect Irons in 6 months. All three irons had identical problems within 2 months of purchase. The major problem was the circuits shorting out. I called Rowenta and asked them if this was a common problem with these so called ""Perfect"" irons and they said that it is not a common problem and they havent heard anyone else having the same problem. I somehow doubt that I was the only one who has had this problem. Ive read in other reviews on this site where a customer had the same problems with 2 of their ""Perfect"" irons.Also brown dripping water did occur but only during the shorting out. So it only ruined one nice white dress shirt.Good luck taking a chance with this iron."
4,"Great savings, great product","This is a great savings even over wholesale stores like Costco and much cheaper than Walmart, especially with the free Super Saver Shipping. I am a little disappointed that the price has increased from $29.99 but it is still a savings. Pampers is the only brand of diapers that I use on my son because they fit him the best."
3,"Not bad, but cruisers are better","The standard Pampers aren't bad, but my wife and I like the Cruisers much better. They are a better fit and easy to put on."
1,Spend the extra money buy Nintendo brand,"Plugged these cables into my brand new receiver, and two of the pins broke off inside the receiver! Very weak, cheap quality. I managed to drill the broken pins out of my receiver (scary!!!), and replaced these with a set of Nintendo cables. MUCH better!"
3,Good for the Money But Wires Aren't Labeled,"Based on so many positive reviews I thought I'd give this a shot. I'll keep this brief: Hooked up the component cable between my Wii and Panasonic Plasma. Color was WAY OFF, not even close, there was a constant buzzing sound (maybe a poor ground or something) Loud enough that as soon as I hooked it up my 4 year old said ""Dad, whats that sound? Did you break the TV?""Edit: Turns out I had the red connectors hooked up backwards. There are two red and they don't have lables(thanks to the commenter on my review). changed the plugs and the chord works just fine. Color is correct and there is no buzzing sound. Only 3 stars because the wires aren't labeled for simpletons like myself, and the quality of the chord is pretty low, but I didn't expect much for five bucks."
4,Good golf game,The game is enjoyable to play. Since I can nolonger play golf outdoors this version more then makes up the for the loss of physical play.
1,HD Pro cables,The cables i got look nothing like the picture and they are extremely CHESSY. very disapointed but for the money.. ugh you would expect them to be at least close to the same as picture they are trash use the money you spend on better cables and add a few more dollars.[...]
1,defective,This cable is junk. The colors are all messed up (all are various shades of green) and there's some kind of low-pitched hum in the sound. Wii was working perfectly with it's standard cabe before this one. POS. Beware.
1,You get what you pay for !!!!,Garbage !!!!!! I think this cable actually killed the color that I got w/ the originals...and the loud buzzing gets old quick...You'll have more fun taking the 5 bucks you were gonna spend on this and throw it out the window on a windy day and watch it blow......
4,Good product,"This cable definitely increased the quality of the netflix streaming I was doing from my wii, however it still is noticeably worse than streaming netflix through my roku with an hdmi cable (which is what I ended up using). wii is really just for games unless you have a smaller non-hi-def tv."
4,Perfect.,"Works just as described, I've had no issues! Only problem was it took several weeks to arrive, but that doesn't have to do with the quality of the product! =)"
1,Really disappointed,"It was shipped quickly, however after plugging it in it began to distort the video games rendering it useless. So a complete waste of money wouldn't recommend this."
1,Waste..,"The cable doesn't even display in 480p, when I set my Wii video settings to HDTV - component, the video goes out. (Then I had to blindly navigate to set it back to 480i.) Just spend more money on the original cables designed for the Wii so you don't have to go through any hassle."
1,Will not use it EVER,"The product takes away half of the screen at any setting, the game looks and feel better with the SD cables."
1,Absolutely did not work,"Cables did not work at all. Tried it on 3 different setups. Just plain don't work. I was forced to give it one star in order to publish this review, but it gets zero stars."
5,WORKS PERFECTLY,WORKS PERFECTLY NOT ONE PROBLEM WITH IT PAKGED VERY GOOD GREAT FAST SHIPPING CAME FASTER THEN WAS SUPPOSE TO COME HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT
2,Don't expect much difference,"Despite what you read, you cannot get the WII to display higher resolution than 480p. It is only slightly clearer or sharper than the display using the cable that came with the console (on my 50"" plasma). Don't waste you money on cables. Save up for a PS3 instead."
1,Poor video qulaity,"The cable worked to provide an alternate source of video signal, but the video quality is very poor. The color is an off green color and as such has been disconnected and not in use. I would not purchase this again"
5,great price,"saved money, delivered quick, and works perfect, I believe the Wii is only 480p so you might not notice much of a difference with the picture quality but this cable free'd up another HDMI slot on the TV so worth the price!"
4,"light, functional money clip","This titanium money clip is a light weight and very functional money clip for those who like to carry a few cards and folding cash without the bulk of a wallet or heavy clip. I usually have +-3 cards and +- 15 bills and this clip works great for me.If you like ""bling"" or equate heavy weight with quality, this clip is not for you."
2,Do not meet the expectation,It is very light but not strong enough to hold everything. It can only hold couple of cards and it loses out easily. Do not meet my needs. Definitely this is not for a heavy duty.
2,Titanium Money Clip,I purchased the Titanium Money Clip as a Christmas gift for my husband. Upon presenting the money clip we were both disappointed in the quality. The clip did not appear to be very durable and we do not think that it will stand up to multiple uses over time.
3,Not as shiny as pictured.,"The clip came in impressively stylish packaging, but once I looked past the blue felt pouch, I was disappointed that it was so lightweight; it felt almost cheap and I wanted more of a substantial feel to it. It wasn't very shiny either. But it works."
2,Hmm...disappointed,This is a poorly made money clip. The screeches when you clip and it crunches the bills without any cards. The stainless steel hinged money clip for $13 is MUCH better. You can find this on amazon.
1,Bad Rice Everytime,Do not waste your money on this rice cooker. Spend a little more and get one that performs well. This one will cook the rice and then proceed to burn it everytime.
1,Find another rice cooker!,"Rice cookers are great...that is if you get the right one. After wearing out our first one, we bought this one thinking the non-stick surface would be nice. Bad mistake. It is easy to clean...it just doesn't cook consistently. We've tried various amounts of water and we finally decided to toss this one over the fence and buy a new one."
5,The best G Gundam boxed set,"This is the better of the 2 boxed sets currently available and will probably be better than the one that is coming out in April. I love this one the most cause so much happens in these episodes. The characters that were introduced in the 1st boxed set are developed more and you understand what is going on more and more. Plus it comes to a very satisfying end and sets up the next set of DVDs quite well. Though dont listen to me just go and buy this right now! You wont be sorry. Though buy the other boxed set too, so you will understand what is going on."
4,"entertaining, thoughtful, and quite inspiring","Dancing Barefoot is one of those books that as your reading, you take a step back and say, ""oh my god I totally understand this! This was me.""The book is a collection of stories that Wil had posted on his blog and compiled together. The stories are very inspiring and Wil shows his emotions in one of the most effective ways that humans do: through his writing. I was very touched after having read Dancing Barefoot and even inspirted enough to do some writing of my own.If you're considering whether or not you want to purchase Wheaton's book, just read his blog and within 10 minutes of reading some of his entries your mind will have been set yourself.I loved it, and look forward to Wil's next novel."
5,Who would've guessed...,"This really is a cool book. Wil lets you into his life in a way that most autobiographical works fall short of. In these five short stories, you are taken on a ride through joy and sorrow. Well, one thing I gcan definately say...he writes much better than I do."
1,Is it safe?,"I like the basic idea of the super pole, but the way the horizontal bar has to be moved is a bit scary. It is very unstable during adjustment and I am afraid it could cause a fall and an injury, which is exactly what it is supposed to prevent. I'm not yet sure, but I think I will be returning this pole. Also, when I first received it pieces were missing. I called the manufacturer and they were rude and impatient with me and refused to send the parts. I finally had to call Amazon to get the parts I needed even to set it up!"
4,Great Book,"Well written, fascinating, historical fiction about Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and especially Lydia Jackson Emerson. Author does a fabulous job of adding life and words to these characters."
3,A little shallow,"I guess I have to agree with most reviews that this book is a fun novel that holds the reader's interest. The words are very well chosen and the characters really come alive. I have to say, though, that I was a little disapointed with the lack of Emerson's and Thoreau's writing and general philosophy. It would have been a lot more interesting to tie in a little more philosophical and literary details. Overall, it's a fun but a little shallow romantic novel about Emerson's second wife and her alleged feelings for Thoreau."
1,Don't let your Catholic daughters read this one.,"As the mother of a middle-school age Catholic girl, I was very disappointed in the tone and information in this book. I suppose it is meant to be funny and to make the authors feel better about their mistakes. I, however, would rather encourage my child to respect herself and the teachings of the Catholic Church. This is definitely NOT the book to give teenage Catholic girls who are trying to learn about themselves and their faith."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"With a book that gives such litle respect to sexuality, don't even waste your time.I suggest ""Dear Newlyweds"" by Pope Pius XII, for the educated; but for the junior high or high school student, I suggest ""The Catholic Girl's Guide"" by Rev. F.X. Lasance or his ""Young Man's Guide."" The Young Man's Guide has personally benifited me greatly."
2,Very Good,This Cd Is A Very Good Cd Even Though It Is Not Recent I It Is One Of My Favorites I Would Consider This Cd A Old School Or Classic Spanish Cd.
3,Only if you love Everything Marvin Gaye ever did,"This Anthology is an excellent collection of all of Marvin Gaye's music and shows his wide range. However, I had never even heard many of the songs on it. If you're looking for his top hits, you're better off with one of the other collections."
1,Don't use ice with it,"Although it says it will crush ice, don't even bother trying. After two times of crushing ice, the blade broke and the entire bottom of the blender fell apart, leaking strawberry smoothie all over my kitchen. Save yourself the headache and spend more money the first time."
1,Not a blender,"This really doesn't even deserve the name ""blender"". Even a simple milkshake with just ice cream and a bit of milk was too much for this thing to handle. The motor just runs without actually blending anything. Don't waste your money."
1,I don't know how they call this a blender,"I was making hummus in this blender, which takes a long time since the motor is so weak, and smoke began pouring out of the back of the unit. I pulled the plug and could hear the crackling of melting plastic coming from the insides of the blender.Now my kitchen smells like a burnt motor.Buy a better blender."
4,Humorous without being coy,"This is a very pleasant book to pick up and enjoy, a chapter at a time. I am not a wanna be farmer and Marsha Boulton does not paint a perfect picture of farm life. However she does manage to convey the joys and aggravation of life in the country. I wouldn't want to live there but I would certainly like to visit. (As long as I don't need to deal with the sheep!)"
1,Blacj and Decker Can opener,"Very difficult to use...should be easier. Price was decent but not value. We may sell at a tag sale soon and buy a more efficient, easier to operate can opener."
2,Tired of shredded labels,"The can opener shreds the labels off of the tops of the cans. I even get small pieces of metal on my counter top when I use this. Every time I open a can I end up having to fish out little pieces of paper from our food. Other than these two problems, it has opened everything. It is easy to clean as well. I am in the market for a new opener."
4,likens the soccer world to that of tribesmen,the soccer tribe is an excellent insight to the parallels of soccer and the brutal struggle for survival as experienced from a tribesmen. the book is full of color pictures as well as information that can benefit the veteran player/observer as well as the beginner.
5,Love It!,"I love this steamer! I've had the larger size for years, but wanted a smaller second steamer for smaller portions. Perfect size for one to three people. Easy to use and makes great rice too."
3,Steamer okay,I bought this to cook chicken breasts but found I didn't like how they came out. Didn't seem cooked even after 30 minutes. I guess you need to use really thin breasts. Works great for broccoli and hot dogs though. I haven't tried rice. Overall great if you want to use it for veggies. I would try something else if you are looking to do chicken.
2,Small steamer with obsolete technology,"This was the first steamer I ever owned. I purchased it back in '89. I would not recommend it owing to the slow speed at which it steams and the small basket size. The newer oval syle with the insta-steam function generates instant steam and the steam is more evenly distributed. This model has a large heating element visible in the reservoir. The entire reservoir must be heated to 212 deg. before you get steam. Spend a few bucks more for the oval steamer with the insta-steam function. It cooks faster, better and is easier to store."
3,Nothing Special,"This book was pretty cheesy. I like cheesy so that really wasn't a problem. I enjoyed reading this book, it had a few good parts, I really can't say that I was scared at any point, but I haven't found any books that really have scared me.The major problem with this book has been mentioned by other reviewers. The copy editor apparently died prior to doing this book. I have NEVER seen so many problems in one book - we are talking about one every two pages. When there is a problem here and there it doesn't really bother me that much but the problems in this book managed to disrupt the flow of the book. Otherwise, this was decent, won't win the pulitzer or anything - but I don't think that was Clark's intention"
3,it looks cheap but its a really hard case,"the case is hard enough to protect your ds very well, but it really look like a metal box, in the inside, in the place where you put the ds is of cheap foam, and it smell like new shoes ... at least i fell my ds is very well protected"
1,Do anything you want with your money... except buying this.,"DBZ is one of my favorite animes ever. And it even is what got me into other anime. So I'm really upset to see its name brandished on this piece of trash. This DBZ movie is pure crud, apparently, someone spit on a movie script and passed it off as a film. The movie is so horrible, with none of the stuff that made DBZ good, with third-rate jokes, bad fighting(way below DBZ standards) and horrid music. Want to know what's really bad, though? That you know how horrible a movie is when the tacky English dub is actually BETTER than the original Japanese version! Paying some guy $25 to punch you in the face is actually a better choice than purchasing this hunk of garbage."
3,It is okay,"Not one of the better Dragon BAll z movies. However, one reviewer contastantly tries to fit the movie into the seires. One must realize, the Dragon Ball z movies have nothing to do with the series, they are not meant to occur during the actual series. This is why dead characters are alive in some movies, and some peopel do or do not have certain moves. The series of Dragon Ball Z is based on the comics, the movies are not. Therefore do not try to look for a deep correlation between the two."
5,oh yeah,"this is one of the great DBZ movies. after movie #6, they get better. this one is about three androids that attack the earth. since Dr. Gero is dead, who Could have made these killer androids? goku and the rest of the Z fighters have to respond to the call and destroy this androids"
4,More Androids!!!,"So far, this was one of the better DragonBall Z features. It has great animation, good fight scenes, and a cool story. The only aspect of this DVD that wasn't the greatest was the music. It is too bland and all the themes sound pretty much the same. Hardcore fans will be happily pleased but others might be a little disapointed."
2,Cropped transfer,These movies were originally filmed in and correctly framed for 4:3. A 16:9 pan & scan crop was shown in the theaters and is what you get in this bluray release. For me the 16:9 looks overly chopped and not polished at times. Movies the were originally filmed in a wide screen format normally have better framing. Also this release still only has stereo audio. Both the DVD 4:3 and the bluray 16:9 will get the job done but I prefer the un-cropped version.
2,Cheapo,"Having bought this bar set as a Christmas gift, I was tempted to return it. It looked really cheap, from the black plastic box to the swizzle sticks and napkins. I kept it only because of the time and expense of returning it. My apoligies to the recipient!"
1,BELIES VERBATIM'S REPUTATION,"I've been shocked at my last Verbatim purchase. Of the first 6 discs I've tried, 3 were no good. If this continues, I most probably will not use this brand again, even though my luck with it in the past has been nearly 100%. Reliability is an all or nothing thing."
5,"and if you dont knooooow, now you know","I'm so glad i got one and in the spirit of war, I hope you didn't. The book should be re-named ""the mystery of chess-boxing"", haaaaaaaaa! The game of chess, is like a sword fight You must think first, before you move. Toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon. When it's properly used, it's almost invincible"
5,fantastic!,"My husband requested this as a Christmas gift last year and far be it from me to tell him not to clean anything, so I got him one. It sat in the closet for 4 months until we moved into our first home and the carpets really looked like they needed to be replaced, but having just bought the house, we had other priorities. Then when our new puppy had an accident on the carpet my husband jumped at the chance to try out his machine. Not only didn't it clean up her mess, but it removed stains the prior owners' cat left behind months, maybe even years before hand!! I'm extremely impressed and so is my mother in law who has requested one for Christmas this year!"
2,not well made,"Although it seemed to work well for a few months, the plastic front (liquid) casing cracked overtime(out of warranty of course) so now it leaks everytime I use it. And just recently the battery has gone. Not easy to replace or cheap. Yes it did work well for the 1st year, but should have worked much longer."
2,Not the best....,"Like the other reviewer stated, I own this. It's worth it for a while, but the sprayer does break down, then you have to buy a new one. I'd really like it if Bissell made it better. There's not a lot out there for pet clean up."
1,Power-less on stains,"Purchased on Lowe's recently and am very disappointed. This unit will probably work well if you're trying to remove small wine/juice stains, but forget it on mud or pet stains. The battery life per charge is ONLY 5 MINUTES, which Bissell fails to inform you on the outside of the box. I've used many cordless tools, such as drills and screwdrivers, so my expectation was to get at least 10-15 minutes of continuous operation. I'd rate this unit alot higher if it had an AC adapter, but alas (according to the fine print in the manual) the unit is not designed to operate while plugged in, only to charge for that next 5 minutes for operation!If you're talking pet or kid stains, try a more powerful unit!"
5,Perfect replacement,"My old lever had become worn out and would no longer stay in the down position, so we were having to hold it down in order to let the tub drain. The lever on my old plate had just a simple clip on the back to hold it in the up or down position. This plate has a much stronger spring mechanism on the back to hold it in position which I imagine will last a lot longer. I'm no plumber, but it was simple to replace: just remove the screws, pull out the linkage from the drain pipe, switch the linkage to the new lever using the old cotter pin, and re-install. I just wish it would have come with a new cotter pin. My old one was pretty grimy, but it was fortunately still in good enough condition to re-use. Other than that I'm completely satisfied."
4,Late Night Fun!,"My wife and I put this on last night and let me tell you...It rocks! Fast paced action and lots of samurai blood and guts abound in this Tokyo effort from Hitoshi Ozawa from Takashi Miike's ""Dead or Alive."" My best recommendation of this movie would be to fans of recent Samurai picks, Miike, Troma and...Well, I think you get the idea."
3,Cute but things fall out easily,"The Easter bunny brought this to my daughter, along with a Googles Webkinz. She was afraid to wear him in this pouch because he fell out so easily. It may be better for LittleKinz."
3,Full size: net is very short. Not like picture,"Not a bad product for the price but pictures are misleading. I have a full size truck, so I ordered the Full Size unit. Product info says 60 -65"" bed width. My bed is 65"". I figured the netting would be 60"" minimum leaving 3"" on each side. WRONG! The net is so short that there is 5""+ gap on each side. (54"" net) This is probably a dangerous situation for something that is supposed to keep stuff in the bed. It seems like a sturdy device, the metal tubes are quite rigid, however, they were cut to length after the tube was protectively coated.... so the cut ends will rust immediately I'm sure. Also, the cut ends are rolled in to a smaller diameter when cut...this binds on the sliding tube. (The end tubes slide so you can remove the unit.) So it will not be a few seconds to remove/replace this each time you want to use it...especially when it starts to rust!"
4,Joyfully goofy,"This is joyfully goofy music, in quite a few styles. It's sorta early Elvis crossed with klezmer -- mostly upbeat fun pieces sung with enthusiasm. If some go on a little long or become a tad repetitive, their good humor tends to redeem them. ""Gypsy Heart"" is about twice (more?) as long as its material, but I do enjoy some of the balalaika phrases in it. The opening number, ""Rocketman"" is guaranteed to get this old guy up and dancing and moving, and is a nice homage to the Elton John song of the same name, to which it bears no musical resemblance. Indeed, there's a quality of Wierd Al Yankovic in all the songs; affectionate parody, earnest but never academic. Just fun stuff."
5,Belly Dance comedy act,"My Belly Dance Troupe uses ""I Wanna See You Belly Dance"" for a hilarious audience participation bit. The crowd goes crazy pushing their friends up on stage to see THEM belly dance."
3,Letters to Liesl,An easy read and quite informative. Nevertheless a bit redundant throughout. It tells the story of a reunion of the actors of the children in the Sound of Music many year later and incorporates letters received from fans.
1,I just don't get the point of it....,The problem with this one is that when your baby urinates while you are changing it the urine goes right through where it folds up and right over the sides onto the changing table itself or onto the floor. you would be better laying just a towel on top of your changing table. I would buy a regular mat for the changing table and a regular fold up mat seperate for travel.
3,"Good read, but....","Hey, I just can't believe Frank Bank could get laid by 1,000 different women. Maybe 20 tops.Seriously....most women would be hot for Eddie Haskell before him."
2,I feel disloyal by writing this,"I am not just a very big fan of Leave it to Beaver, but I am also interested in 1950's culture and nostalgia. I did like the first few chapters. Frank Bank (so I'm not calling him Lumpy) writes about some great LTB behind the scenes shenanigans that made what I paid for the book worthwhile. Chapter three is the beginning of the rest of the book, mostly about his sexual exploits and how he started every cool trend in California during his day. That's why I am only giving it two stars-- I can only recommend the beginning of the book.I worried about writing this. I wondered, what if ""Lumpy"" reads this review?? I'm such a LTB fan!!! But then I realized after reading his book that his ego isn't in danger of being injured. So, I would recommend buying this book for the first two chapters only.Now, if only Tony Dow would write HIS book! :)"
2,POOR,"Quick shipment, but picture is deceptive. Ruby color is highly variable, diamond accent point is an invisible chip, and gift note amateurly done."
2,Toooo big,It may be good for other anesthetist may be for beginners but not for me it's tooooo big u can consider it as a reference for procedures
4,excellent information!,This was very helpful in my studies. I used Jaffe to get prepared for my clinical preparation. I would recommend this book to those pursuing a carreer in anesthesia.
2,One long mumble,"I can see how the movie ""loosely-based"" on this text succeeded. By being interesting, by depicting some graphic action scenes and by developing some salient characters."
1,don't like TRO360,"I purchased the toaster oven 8 months ago, I don't know who designed the take down tray for cleanning. You have to take it off the cupboard hanger and tip it upside down to clean the crumbs out it tips down to ward the wall back and I don't have the space to do that. It is very hard to lift it up and out to clean and dangerous. I have had other toaster ovens like this but the bottom tray lifted down from the front of the toaster.ThanksJeannine"
2,Not A Great Toaster Oven,"I've had my Black and Decker for about 2 years now, and the only reason I didn't replace it sooner was out of sheer laziness. I don't do a lot of creative cooking in the oven, but I do expect it to at least produce a decent piece of toast, which it doesn't. I finally decided to replace the oven, when it started to make weird buzzing sounds, and I figured that at some point it would short out and I could have a fire. Needless to say, I am going to try a different brand."
4,Mine worked/works great,"Well I have had my classic toaster oven for 11 years without any problems, I am only replacing it now because it looks like its 11 years old, I pretty much wore it out with constant use, I can only hope this one will be just as good...."
1,only because there is no option for &quot;0 star&quot;,"we barely use our toaster oven, yet it's gotten to the point where, as in previous reviews, the toast switch has broken, so i now hold the switch down until the desired result is attained. black & decker should stick to power tools."
1,This toaster oven = a lemon,This item was very lightly used. Mostly for toast and pop tarts. I didn't have it very long before the rocker switch for toasting quit working. I wish I'd known that the toast switch was a problem point before I got it.
1,never again,"Our last toaster oven was Black & Decker and worked ok for several years. Eventually, it started turning itself on with nobody in the room so we decided to replace it. I was reluctant to get another B&D but the price was good and the other brands were too large. Our toast on/off button lasted only about ONE MONTH before it stopped working. I have never been so disappointed in a product."
2,"Too little, too little!","This disc wasn't bad as presented in the ""voyuer"" genre, it just had too few scenes and was too short. had they included another six or eight scenes and bumped the running time to 90 minutes it would have been worth the asking price."
5,It realy works!,"My son has autism and has difficulty falling asleep at bedtime. The dvd combines classical musical with videos of animals. The music starts out upbeat and then slows. As the music slows down, the animals begin to yawn and fall asleep. Evenually the screen shows twinkling stars. This video worked very well for my son. He was about 5 when he started using it and he still uses it today. (He is now 11.) He no longer watches the video but the music helps him fall aseep.I would recomend this product for anyone who has a child that has difficulty going to sleep."
3,MYSTERY BETTER THAN THE ROMANCE.,"I RATHER THINK THAT MS. STANHOPE SHOULD STICK WITH THE FORMULA THAT, IN THIS READER'S OPINION, TAKES HER FROM A MEDIOCRE WRITER TO POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING GREAT ROMANCE WRITER.THAT FORMULA IS HER ABILITY TO WRITE HUMOROUS ROMANCE NOVELS, AS SHE DISPLAYED IN HER WRITING ""MADE FOR EACH OTHER"" AND ""NIGHT TO REMEMBER."" IF YOU WANT TO READ HER BEST, CHECK OUT THESE TWO.I WILL NOT KEEP THIS ONE TO READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN; THOUGH I DO NOT REGRET BUYING IT."
5,"""I am very proud to have had such a father.""","Seibei is a poor working class samurai who doesn't want to be a samurai. He'd much rather be a farmer but there is no money in being a farmer and he has two small daughters and a senile old mother to take care of. His wife died after a long sickness that left Seibei even deeper in debt.A ray of sunshine comes to Seibei's bleak life when a childhood sweetheart moves back and bonds with his daughters. She's still in love with him, but he is ashamed of his poverty and rejects her love. Civil unrest breaks out and Seibei is given an assignment that will most likely result in his death.Very moving and beautifully crafted I was teary-eyed like a little girl by the end. It's easy to see how this film won 13 (!) Japanese Academy Awards. And speaking of the Japanese Academy Awards I was looking on imdb and very few of the past winners are available on DVD here in America. That's a shame."
5,Anti-Samurai films at their best,"The trailer and posters, and other overused and trite forms of pre-determining what a film will be like are misleading. the Twilight Samurai feels like it should be just another samurai flick where a impoverished peasant finally reveals his past and his finely tuned samurai technique to his family, enemies or a master. But there is so much more to this film. Yamada turns the classic tales of the samurai on their head, But its more than just an inversion, it separates itself from other anti-samurai films, like Sword of Doom or Sword of the Beast. The cinematography is bleak and brooding, less like 21st century Japanese cinema and more in the style of Dogme 95 or even earlier Scandinavian filmmakers. Hiroyuki Sanada is phenomenal as 'Twilight' Seibei, he portrays the impoverished retainer perfectly, allowing Yamada's film to continue to exceed expectations. A great play on the traditional samurai movie that is every bit as intense and emotional as Rashomon or Harikiri"
4,Relevant and Moving,"Most poems deal with loneliness and longing, such as, ""...The longing of lovers separated, is like the light of the moon; it pierces the clouds and rides the waters to the beloved's room"", while some make you feel you can smell the Mandarin Duck Flowers ""Their verdant splendor fills the scented stairs of stone; like little mandarin ducks, in pairs..."" or the feeling of looking out from a mountaintop, ""...gazing abroad from up in the sky, my headdress, with its trailing pearls crowns a thousand peaks."" Poems worth memorizing and reflecting on."
3,new format NCLEX-RN,"This book is one of the only one's of its kind. It is very informative but it lacks in the number of questions. I am sure there will be many more of the ""alternate- item"" NCLEX books coming out. I say if you can wait, then wait, but if you have got to see the ""alternate- item "" format for the new NCLEX then go buy it, it moderatly priced at 14.99 new"
3,"An entertaining story, but not quite the classic many reviewers seem to think it is","This is an imaginative and suspenseful science fiction story dealing with the effects of telepathy. It's short for a novel--only about 20,000 words--but the author does a really good job of creating three interesting, contradictory, and textured characters and then ratcheting up the tension with some surprising plot twists.I've read a little Harlan Ellison, because I think he is a very imaginative writer, but I can only take him in small doses. I find his writing style can be pretentious and this story was no different. He tried too hard to weave subtext about racism into a story that fundamentally had very little to do with race. He also threw in a couple unnecessary rants about religion, which (while funny) distracted me from the story."
5,indescribable,"Ok, so that's a hackneyed review title. I read this novella several years ago when it was published in Omni. Actually, a friend of mine, who I had been trying to convince to read Ellison, thrust the magazine into my hands, and with a frenzied look in his eyes stated, ""You must read this, and give me everything you have of his!""Very simply put, this is the only story I have ever read that I was physically exhausted at the end. It's that good. It's that powerful. It has that many twists and turns. Our main character can get into other people's minds. What happens when he runs into a doppleganger who can enter his mind?Take care."
5,Impressed by the technical quality of the information,"This book is not just ""why I like my dog,"" somewhat to my surprise. The most valuable parts of the book aren't really the suggestions about what people should do, but simply the factual descriptions of the way things are. The absolutely disgusting - but documented, true - information about the meat industry and lab animals was distressing, but I'm glad I read it. I admit that this is one of only 3 ""cause"" books I have ever read which actually got me to modify any aspect of my own behavior."
4,Solid.,"Although it may not be the most innovative or the most expansive game on the market, Age of Wonders captivates the hearts of gamers withits solid tried-and-true gameplay. Even if the game borrows details from several others, it just improves so much on the gameplay that it's hard not smile. While the game lacks any randomness, it captures the old-school feeling of true feudalism. The color palette is fantastic and I was surprised at the superior quality of the music - excellent, to say the least. The units are well-balanced, and despite the low number of different unit types the game allows for a fascinating amount of strategy, unlike the other games which mainly specialize in getting as many units, items, and characters on-screen as fast as possible.Even if a game doesn't fill your screen with glittering effects, or doesn't offer you fifteen billion different customizable units doesn't exactly mean that it cannot be excellent. Age of Wonders is."
5,Outstanding!,"This book is an excellent resource. After almost a year of job hunting, I bought this book, put its suggestions into practice, and within a month I had the interview that got me a job in my field. This book helps you generate a bank of success stories focusing on your experience, education, and skills, and shows you how to use them to best showcase yourself in an interview. It provides many example interview questions, and teaches you how to use your stories to answer those questions well, rather than offering canned responses that make all candidates sound the same. Finally, this book goes beyond interview questions and answers to cover other aspects (such as demeanor and attitude) that have a big impact on the impression you give a prospective employer. If you're job hunting, this book is your best investment."
1,Terrible product,Very difficult to understand and all but one tech support guy was rude and unhelpful.
4,peyote stitch,"You MUST be able to understand and use beading graphs and be comfortable doing the peyote/gourd stitch to fully utilize this book. It is NOT a ""how-to"" book. Designs are glorious and there are a goodly number of them but this is primarily a pattern book. Suzanne Cooper has one of the best websites and she will show you how to do several off-loom beading stitches on it if you need a refresher course."
3,Wallet Tan Color,"Very nice leather, but color was not as I thought from picture.. More orange than tan."
3,Cheap looking and too small!,Just received this wallet. First thing I noticed was it's cheap looking. Started to switch over my other wallet and only half of it fits. I'm chalking this one up and going to the store to get one that's not so cheap looking and will hold my stuff!
5,Just what I was looking for,I have more cards then I'd like to admit and finding a wallet to hold them all is a chore. This wallet held all my cards and then some and it's layout keeps me organized.I really love this wallet.
2,poor quality,Doesn't worth the cost. The light seems very similar to a florescent lamp. The switch to turn on/off has a poor design.
3,I think it really is working,I have been using the Verilux happy light for almost two weeks and believe it may be working.I have been waking up with a better attitude and feeling rested.I believe this product is worth the time I spend with it and think it was a worthy purchase.
5,Great light,"Verilux Natural Spectrum HappyLite Mini Ultra, SilverI use a larger scale version of this light by Verilux. I sent my sister this desktop version and she is already getting good results. If you have SAD - this light definitely works as good as an antidepressant and it also enhances the effect of your antidepressant if you have a chemical imbalance like I do.Only the summer sunlight helps SAD - so this light is great for the other 3 seasons."
2,Might be better off by,"If it is the light that is the concern for tired eyes and people with mood issues, then maybe just get a full spectrum bulb, stick it in a mini lamp and either use a frosted shade or make sure the light is frosted. It may be WAY cheaper and more efficient : ) I'm all about saving money!"
2,Good Product but not necessary for the price,"The product seems to work as described. However, I have since learned that equal value to these lights can be obtained by purchasing a full spectrum light bulb to be placed in an ordinary lamp, at a fraction of the cost. So I do feel rather ripped off. But, caveat emptor, shame on me, and all that!"
1,The worst Conan yet,"I have read just about all the Conan books, starting with the Howard stuff in the 70's, and then the assorted authors paying homage thereafter. I have not read any of Poul Andersons other works, he might have written some good stuff elsewhere. Having slogged through Rebel, this is by far the weakest effort of the Conan lineage so far, in my opinion. Howards Conan would NEVER have said ""Nice doggie, Come here I have something for you doggie"" for any reason. Complete drivel! Ol Robert E must be roiling in his grave."
2,"What, No deleted scenes?","This movie is a mess. Nothing makes sense. It seems like half the story is missing. While watching it, I kept trying to fill out the gaps in my mind, but eventually I stopped because I was nearly bored to death. If there's not going to be a good story, then you need sex and action. This movie has no action and no sex. It's all a big tease. On the good side, the acting and production values are good, but that's about it."
2,A new review from me... Rattle has come back to stay,"I have changed my opinion of this fan. After having it for about 2 weeks it started a rattle that I was able to fix, but after about 2 or 3 more weeks the rattle has come back and I can not get it to stop.The fan still works fine and moves air well, it still oscillates as it should. The rattle is not so loud we can not use it in the living room, but my wife and I can not use it while we sleep anymore."
5,Pleasant and Enjoyable,"This CD really is a joy to listen to. These songs get in my head and don't come out all day. That's actually a good thing though- these songs are incredible. The music is rather laid back and comfortable. 'Rain' is probably one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life, and the original release is on this disc. The CD is quite similar to their follow up, Thrifty Mr. Kickstar- which I would highly recommend as well. Really, you cannot go wrong with this album- it's great."
1,untrue product description,"when I ordered this dvd collection, I was very excited because it said it was dubbed in english. when I tried to view it however, it is not. it only has english sub titles. it is all spoken in japanese and since im not from japan, i am very dissapointed. If I could return it I would but since i have already opened it, i dont think this is an option. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
5,Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8,"A wealth of information is provided on the Grappling aspects of Chin-Na. The instruction is detailed and the material is easy to follow (so long as you have a willing partner). My only criticism is that the application of techniques is direct and does not incorporate Chin-na striking or distractionary measures which can be very helpful in applying grappling techniques. Still, I really liked the material and highly recommend it."
3,published in '89; for repeat miscarriage sufferers,"After my first miscarriage, I was anxious to learn what I could do to prevent a second. This book largely discusses inherent fertitlity problems leading to repeat miscarriage and barely touches on possible environmental factors. It's important to know it was published in '89. If you are looking for an infertility specialist and want to explore various medical treatments, and don't mind the book being outdated, this one's for you."
2,"Very cheap, but cheap is cheap","dont sound bad but have to move the connector to get it right, imitation os the in ear ipod headphones"
1,haha,"I got these headphones just becouse they were 50 cents. but still i was expecting a little more then what i got. when they finaly came i opened the package and took them out. When i tryed to change the rubber piece to a smaller size they broke, the whole front broke off. Still i can use them, the sound is very deep for some reason. I really think these are worth the 50 cents i gave for them :)"
1,Wish I could rate it lower then 1 star,"This movie sucked so bad I broke the dvd and threw it away so that i could not continue the viewing of this movie by others. I am going to my local video store, Buying every copy and destroying them, the director needs to either quit, or get a job, maybe working at a rest stop. He should be tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie till he dies of old age. Most boring, dumb movie ever. Even worse then ""Feeling Minnesota"" and that movie sucked, but at least had a plot."
1,Absolutely Abysmal,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. If I could rate it lower than one star I would. Not even worth the price of a rental. Stay FAAAAR away.
2,"With The Right Folks Behind It ""Rest Stop"" Could've Been Pretty Good,BUT !","Talk about lost opportunities! While it has a couple of good bloody scenes,some good ideas aswell as 1 or 2 pretty damn creepy moments ""Rest Stop"" is one of the most bogus attempts at a backwoods road movie that this horror fan has ever stumbled into. Lucky for me I got to watch it for free on the SCI-FI channel this past weekend so I definitely won't make the mistake of buying it. Words that come to mind not only after watching the movie but 5 minutes into it are(unoriginal,cliche,aweful,ridiculous,mindless,directionless,amateur)Like I said it does have a couple of up's but it has way way too many downer's to save itself. It's just an all over the place insult to the genre!"
1,good substitute for ambien,"You might think that the fact that this comes from a man who worked on the X-Files means that there could be something promising here. But you would be forgetting that many episodes of the X-Files were really not all that great, the charisma of Duchovny and Anderson aside. There are a few decent ideas lurking in this uninspired and dreary attempt at cashing in on horror junkies desperate for a fix (the conclusion of the strange and protracted visit in this film by Joey Lawrence is one; the odd family at the rest stop perhaps another) but not really enough to merit a viewing, really, believe me. Whole stretches of this film are unbelievably devoid of suspense or drama as the lead character sits around. I had to stab myself repeatedly with a sharp pen to stay awake to finish this very dull and depressing hackjob. Find something else, really.... Please."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!,"i Am just going to come out and say it but i want my money back and more importantly i want my 90 minutes back so many flaws its hard to pay attention to the plot.The acting by the main character was so bad iyou may start to think that this movie is a parody, unfortunely its funny unintentionally. If you never take advise take this one don't buy!!"
2,Rest Stop is a horrible attempt at the Horror genre!!!,"Rest Stop is a horrible movie. Sure there are many killings, some with a decent amount of gore and creativity, but that doesn't make up for a bad plotline with a less than pleasing cast. The end and alternate ending both make no sense whatsoever, and after watching this movie, you'll wonder why u wasted your money and how anyone could've thought this was a good movie."
2,Not what I expected,"Being a Religion major in the university, i thought this book was going to be about sorcery. it ended up to be some made up story about some people who was at Tantalus and some strange things happen. This is more of a Ghost story not having anything to do with Hawaiian beleif system but the story is set in hawaii. But it was a pretty fun story to read."
1,Even the cover warns you!,"Another generic 80's band. They were so bad, as bad as music could get in that decade. Even the cover photo seems to say ""Warning: bad haircut mediocre band hyped by MTV"". The awful theme from the lame Michael J. Fox movie (another icon from the era) stands out."
4,"Not the best, but not the worst Night Ranger release","This was actually a pretty good release. The intro to ""Big Life"" is a killer. The ""Color Of Your Smile"" reminds me of ELO's ""Turn To Stone"". Great guitar work from the dynamic duo, as usual."
5,Beautiful!!!,"Both:This is a wonderful movie (quality and all) that has a beautiful message attached not to spoil the movie but once you have seen this it will become very clear what life is all about. Given that this story is one that is very near and dear to me, I must say that this is a powerful movie and the information that is presented is one that will not be forgotten."
4,Good early play...,"Of course, the standard Lynn Nottage plays are _Intimate Apparel_ and _Ruined_. Those two are phenomenal, so if you haven't read those, read those first. If you want to see the early work of a developing playwright, this is for you. _Crumbs from the Table of Joy_ has the Nottage's trademark humor, and hints at the greatness to come. It's worth reading if you're a fan of Lynn Nottage's great writing."
1,Get your facts straight,"The Udjat in no way relates to Christianity's devil, or is used by ""devil worshippers"". This is an ancient EGYPTIAN SYMBOL that actually represents the Eye of Ra, or The Eye of Horus. Good job demonizing yet another sacred symbol NOT A PART OF CHRISTIANITY. It's what you're good at."
4,very elegant,"I bought these for my husband's 40th birthday and got his initials engraved. He loved them and uses them as often as he can, they look very elegant, discrete and yet sophisticated. Great buy."
2,"It's ok, but not the most engaging touchy-feely book","Each page of this book shows a white mouse and a different dinosaur, and a part of each dinosaur is touchy-feely. One dinosaur has rough horns, one has bumpy teeth, one has slippery flippers, one has soft spines, and the one on the front has squishy spots.The book is ok, but the illustrations are not particularly great - the dinos don't have any facial expressions, and they are not doing anything interesting. The mouse doesn't seem to fit in either."
5,Perfect for one-year-old!,"My one-year-old is just starting to pay attention to books and he loves this one! It's a very simple concept and not a lot of words so it can be read quickly and keep your baby's attention. My baby loves touching the different textures on the pages. We read it at least twice a day. He even takes the book on his own and flips through the pages. This was a great buy! I can't wait to buy the other ""That's not my..."" books!"
2,A copy of Zombie Bloodbath 3 and Resident Evil,"I love love low budget horror, but this movie didn't cut it. The gore was substandard without an ending. Too many zombie movies carry on instead of having a conclusion.There were parts where I didn't know if the zombies were eating intestines or a bloody whoopey cushion. The plot of being trapped in a building with zombies had been overdone. There was nothing original to add to the zombie genre. I was dissapointed. I really wanted to like it, but just couldn't."
3,Nifty little tool,This tool is pretty cool and almost useful. The hammer functions fine for a small hammer and can pull nails just fine. The pliers are a good touch and function ok. The phillips head is poorly designed because the handle gets in the way. The two blades and can opener all have blade play (wiggle when open).Overall this tool is just ok. I wouldn't buy it again though.
4,A great addition to your stand,"This shelf is a great little addition to your Manhasset stand. Will hold pencils, guitar picks, conducting batons, and the like. I've even put a flute on mine! It won't hold anything heavy, though. If you have a Manhasset stand, get one. (I even got two--they can clip to each other so I have two shelves, one below the other!)"
5,excellent wisdumb from an excellent author!!!,"I first read this book about ten years ago when I was still in high school. I continue to read it about once a year and each time I learn something new from it. The years of thinking, gathering quotations, and writing poems has allowed Jeff Haber to create an excellent book. I would strongly encourage anyone to read this book, as I believe all can learn from it."
5,Sacred Music DVD!,"This is one of the best DVDs I have ever purchased. Anybody that enjoys Christian music, will love this very heart warming DVD."
1,Bad Medicinal Dose,"Jack Benny is one of my favorite comedians. It's about a traveling medicine show that dealt a bad dose of medicine for the viewer.*The acting was so bad that I had to quit viewing it. The monologue was stiff and I noticed that when an actor was about to say a line, they would look directly at the camera before they faced the actor they were about to recite the monologue to.*If your time has no value, then by all means purchase it. It's not worth the shipping and handling charges. This movie was one of a 50 pack Family Classics DVD movie collection."
1,Game did not install on PC using Windows 8,Game did not install on PC using Windows 8...This game is of no use to me - can't use it.
3,"Good movies, not excellent","I received the set as a gift. I was very excited about finally seeing the films that are so legendary (and I love Polish filmmakers). However, for some reason all three films did not leave a significant imprint on my mind and soul. I liked Blue, but again, these were only luke-warm emotions. Upon seeing White and before seeing the other two, I even read up on the symbolism of the movie and hidden or not so hidden contexts - still, in my opinion, all three films are only likable."
3,Good but overrated.,"White was the best one. Each movie was filmed wonderfully (Artsy) but the plot lacked. I also think that these movies should have been PG-13 along with that movie Amelia. Why are they R? I know that there light nudity in Amelia but not in Blue, White and Red."
5,Awsome Restore,This Blu Ray edition is very good. Great stories. Wish I could find more foreign films this good. I enjoyed the extras included. Nothing is more pleasant then seeing Julie Delpy in high def.
5,GREAT and FUN!,"I am very impressed with these DVDs and the step by steps. I was hesitant in the beginning because I saw in some reviews the caution that she was too quick for beginners but it wasn't too quick for me. Maybe reading the reviews prepared me for the worst just to recognize the best. I feel that with any new exercise tapes, there are bound to be areas we have to practice more than once to really get it down. With these DVDs, we can rewind it as much as we want if in fact we need to. I got this along with the ""I hate Exercise but love to tap"" and I think it's a great combination to have. I look forward to learning all these dvds to perfection. Also, her tap style is awesome, reminds me also of the old-style great tap dancers of which are the best. This was exactly what I was looking for. Also, the shipment arrived quickly!"
5,useful without being alarmist,"My youngest is a preteen now, but this is still on my shelf, and is my default baby shower gift. By far the most practical childcare book I have found, with level headed advice and tons of useful tricks... really saved the day when my 18month old stuffed a wad of parsley up her nose! Unlike a lot of other books out there, this one is not alarmist, and has great ""profile of the age"" intros to each section that help you keep things in perspective. Also, medical info is filtered for different ages, so you can really tailor the information for your child's age. Full of interesting anecdotes, some of them really humorous, so that I actually wound up reading it for pleasure and reading ahead of my child's developmental ""chapter"". Very highly reccomended"
3,Could have been better,"Lucas practically raped Dee. There is no way that an independent woman like that would have been overcome by lust in that approach. Morals were a lot more important at that time. If you were a decent man, you wed the woman who's virginity you took.What he did in the name of keeping her safe was unutterably stupid. No woman with any backbone would have put up with it.I enjoyed the other love stories more than the primary one. I hope Kyle and Tilly had a good life also.This book of Howard's does not go on the shelf, but to a second-hand book store."
2,Angel Creek,"Normally, I really like Linda Howard. However, with Angel Creek I was more than a little disappointed. It wasn't very deep; actually, it was pretty shallow. All Luke could think about was sex, and I can understand that with a romance, but it wasn't very clear he even cared for her until the very end. A good time passer, but not worthy of a space on the shelf."
3,"You aren`t going to buy this, right?","To be a PC game I would expect it to be like in the xbox, I mean that you could see the person and you could see the things in the way that the character sees them. This is just as PS1 and that`s not such a good console..."
2,Boring,"I can't seem to get past the first hundred pages. The main character, Mira, goes on and on about her homeland, how no one understands her, how she's hated in England, blah, blah, blah. I just can't get into the story. For the people who thought this book was a ""masterpiece"", more power to them. I'm glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste good money on it. Yawn!"
3,Not one of his best,"Wodehouse is at his best when lampooning upper class New York and British society. He is clearly out of his element in this book. While the book's main characters are the typical young couple in love, much of the story is set in lower class New York City, and the other characters include gangsters, poor immigrants, and prize fighters. Wodehouse's attempts to imitate gangster speech are annoying, and many of his characterizations ring false."
4,A lot in one DVD,"I liked the that this showed both beginner and more advanced swing. I felt it was good on teaching steps, but not much at all on technique. You could learn the technique by watching over and over(like where should your arms be-how do you place your feet, where should you be looking)but if you had a problem doing a step, you weren't shown how exactly to do the steps. Overall it was a good DVD on swing and you got your money's worth on learning steps."
1,Avoid this Jigsaw Puzzle,"My 5-year old loves jigsaw puzzles. But this one, sold by University Games Corp. in San Francisco, CA is so poorly made that I doubt any kid would have much fun with it.The pieces are quite large, 2.5"" x 3"", but of such thin cardboard that none of the interlocks will work, therefore the pieces do not stay together. Even when the puzzle is nearly complete, the pieces will detach from one another at the slightest touch. And if it's hard for a 5-year old, how bad must it be for a 3-year old?"
5,worked great,"We had this for only a short time. Although, we couldn't verify it (because it doesn't have a counter, as some more expensive models do, to say if our dog was actually on the couch), as far as we could tell, our dog stayed off the couch almost within a couple days and we didn't notice him getting up on the couches even after the battery died and even when they weren't laid out on the couch."
1,Missing item,"I obviously purchased this item along with another different type of lighted fountain. I did not recieve this item. Instead I recieved two of the same kind. I did not have time to return the other, which was cheaper. I have not recieved a credit adjustment between the difference of the two.. Very difficult to speak with a live person....."
4,lighted fountain,Package received in good order and prompt delivery. The fountain works and is in good condition.
5,"""Grandma, was I ever that small?""","This is a hilariously charming and educational story that tells about how Clifford, America's favorite Big Red Dog was once Clifford, The Small Red Puppy! Years ago, Clifford was adopted because he was the runt of the litter -- just so little and cute. But, he began to grow and grow to great big Clifford size, and the little girl had to adjust and learn to deal with those changes.There is so much for children to take away from this story about the responsibilities of having a pet, changes in family relationships and so much more. Because the book is so funny, the message is so much more palitable, and it will be easy for parents to open discussions.Excellent book with wonderful, eye-opening lessons."
2,Nice drive but...,"It's a very fast drive!!!, I bought it after investigating on the Internet about very big and fast drives. I reached to the conclusion that I should buy an IBM or WD (performance in mind), so I went and buy the WD (despite of what I read in some customer reviews from other places about the reliability of the drive); I was amazed with the performance of it, but after I week of use it died (and by it i mean that the drive didn't start any more, it just make very ugly noises); all data on it was LOST!!!! So i sent it to WD and is has been 15 days and I'm still waiting for the replacement.If I could go back in time I would buy an IBM"
4,Very informative,The healthcare challenge is one that will take a lot to change. I think the book outlines the issues really well and makes you think about what is required to change the healthcare system. The question now is how do undertake such a massive overhaul?
5,Defines quality healthcare,Great book which is still relevant in these changing times. Healthcare is still a long way from delivering quality and this book explains the gaps
3,"good news, bad news","Good news: contains famous works of Mozart for a very small cost. The music is eloquent and perhaps stimulates the brain with the Mozart effect. It is definitly good to listen while commuting and stuck an a traffic jam.Bad news: These music are so well known that to many, it feels redundant. These are not world-class performers or conductors, so the music doesn't have a new intereptation or anything out of the ordinary. Also, I tend to like to have the entire three (or four) movements of the song, not just one movement. And practically all of these songs are the slow movement so it gets redundant.I would recommend this to any beginning listeners but for more experienced listners, try investing in a slightly more expensive but better performed recordings."
2,The music was not restful or relaxing.,"I bought this for my daughter who was recovering from surgery. I played it myself before giving it to her and found I didn't like it at all. I turned it off half way through. It's Mozart, all right but not the Mozart I know and love."
1,Don't be fooled by the description-DISTURBING CONTENT,"I like doctor stuff, I like yaoi. Seemed like a win win with this, especially since the men actually LOOK like men and not women like a lot of yaoi has. (If I wanted to read about women I would.) But this book was disturbing as he**.Kiwibird's review is spot on. The situations are unrealistic (who crawls back to their rapist?), and the characters are not likable. (You have the kid-16 I believe- who rapes his dr, and the dr-in his 20's- who acts super mousy and pretty much developes stolkholm syndrom and keeps going back to the kid and letting him rape him. It's hard to feel sorry for someone who keeps putting themselves in a bad situation.So I don't know where this series is going. Are we supposed to root for these 2 to be a couple? Seems pretty messed up to me. This book seriously freaked me out, it's nothing but rape. Don't be fooled by the description on the back!"
1,Don't judge a book by it's summary . . .,"After reading the summary on the back of the book, I was really looking forward to reading this series; it sounded like a nice little romance story and it started out just the same. It wasn't until the actual relationship started that I realized that this was absolutely not the case.The whole thing reads like a typical ""battered wife"" scenario with the younger main character raping the older and just all around treating him like garbage while the older eventually becomes convinced that he's in love with the younger. It's basically a sick attempt to romanticize rape and there are some serious ""WTF?!"" moments throughout the first volume.Besides the overall sickening plotline, the timeline is choppy and hard to follow at best and, as was stated in other reviews, there was no character development. The two main characters seem to be emotionally ADD at times while other characters just appear and disappear at random with no explanation as to how or why."
3,Disappointing after DERAILED,"I enjoyed DERAILED so much, I could hardly wait to read this new book, but DETOUR was a big letdown. As another reviewer said, it started out like a house afire, but there were just too many wildly implausible brushes with and escapes from death and that diminished my enjoyment to the point I was talking aloud, saying things like, ""Oh, come ON!"" And believe me, I'm one of the easiest readers any author is likely to find -- I will go along with just about anything if it's well-motivated and if I like the characters and am rooting for them -- so when I have a hard time suspending disbelief, you know there's a real problem. Perhaps one of the problems I had with this story is I've seen the movie ""Maria, Full of Grace,"" (also about a mule smuggling drugs from Colombia) which was so well done and believeable that anything less was certain to disappoint me. Recommendation: don't waste your money on the hard cover."
3,"Like Bounty, but prefer select-a-size","The paper is very absorbent but I preferred my previous purchase of select-a-size. I find myself breaking off pieces as I really don't like to waste unnecessary paper, and in breaking the product, there is a small amount of paper lint released. I do wish Bounty made more of an earth-friendly, unbleached, recycled product. I will either resume my use of the Bounty select-a-size or try more earth friendly brands. I am so grateful that I can order bulk from Amazon.... truly a joint saver for me."
2,Feels cheap,I'm use to the Costco packs of Bounty paper towels. These have a completely different feel to them. Each of the sheets feel thinner and more like a napkin than a towel. I'm going back to Costco. Each sheet from Costco goes a lot farther than theses guys.
1,Poor product,I would not recommend buying this product. First the battery compartment on the shark would not open. We spent hours (literally) trying to open it and finally ended up opening it with a drill. The shark worked nicely until my son went into the swimming pool with the remote (it is clearly stated on the box that the remote control is intended for use in the water). The remote control is definitely NOT waterproof! We could hear the water sloshing around inside the remote control and the product never worked after that. I expected a durable product for the price. On the up side Amazon handled the return very professionally. No problem getting my money back.
4,helpful,"Hard to follow at first. Helped me pass the nursing entrance exam, after being out of school for 20 years."
4,So far so good,"First, I am not friendly with Math. I am more than capable of doing basic functions. Where my problems lies is in Fractions, and other advanced Math. This book is easy to follow, and I have noticed that I am remembering how to do Multiplicaton and Division by hand, rather than use a calculator. Good for review, and learning. I would get this book for school children and adults."
5,The last great soul-jazz album,"Recorded in late 1974 and released early 1975, this might be the last great soul-jazz album before things went the way of disco. Of Grover Washington's records, this and Inner City Blues are the ones to get, and luckily, they're still available (All the King's Horses and Soul Box are currently out of print). The four extended cuts begin with ""Earth Tones"", a Bob James penned tune where Washington eases into the pocket with his soprano and then digs WAY deep into the funk with his tenor. ""Passion Flower"" exhibits Grover's lyrical side before the title track kicks into its uplifting groove. ""Black Frost"" actually turns out to be a slow-burning funk cut and ends the set. Washington's subsequent Kudu albums, though solid, never found him getting so gritty and souful as he does here. Highly recommended."
4,A Review,"Awesome CD. I generally don't like punk-type music much, but I do enjoy this one a lot.P.S. patrick, you only don't like Canadians because we're better than you."
2,Surprised...,"Be sure to read the find print. I was planning on using this book as a tool to help me identify and treat skin conditions in clinical practice. There are no pictures in this book, which for skin conditions you would think wouldbe a necessity. If you don't need to visually see the skin condition then you may be able to use this book, but as for me it sits unused on the shelf."
1,stay away!,"terrible attempt to capitalize on her fame and cheat AK fans. No interviews with alicia, just a bunch of nobodies giving their opnions on her."
2,Tea and Sympathy,"I enjoyed this when I saw the play and then the movie, but it is very dated and unpleasant to me now."
5,GREAT!!!,"This book has a great plot, adorable illustrations, and loveable characters. It's perfect for all kids (and adults too!). You feel like you know the characters, and even though they are frogs, they seem very real. It is very imaginative. I've read it to every kid I've babysat for, and they have all loved it!!! (The youngest to understand it was three, and the oldest to go crazy about how great it was was my grandmother.)"
3,Works well if it doesn't fall off,The snoreclipse helped to reduce the level of snoring although it constantly fell off which kept me looking for it during the night. If you move constantly while sleeping this is not for you.
2,Magnet does not work,"Mine falls off within the first hour of sleep. Everytime I wake up, its gone. Don't waste your money on this device."
5,makes a difference,I had been buying these for over a year and they stopped stocking them so I found them here! Using them at night stops snorng and has helped prevent sinus infections which I used to always get.
4,An incredibly useful study tool!,"I prefer the NASB translation due to the accuracy of its translation and was very pleased to find it available in this study Bible. The Greek & Hebrew Strong's numbers inserted in the text plus the complete Strong's Concise Dictionary and additional Greek and Hebrew helps are wonderful. The editor's notes at the bottom of some pages are also informative. I recommend this Bible to any serious student of the Bible who would like a decent measure of Greek and Hebrew help in a single portable Bible. To keep the Bible from getting overly large (it's quite a reasonable size now) it doesn't index as many words as I would have liked, but it is enough to be useful when I am away from home and my more extensive study tools. The one thing I would have definitely preferred (even at the cost of increased size) is larger type. It is set in a very crisp, 10 point (I would guess), serifed, typeface which is readable but still small for my over-40 eyes even with my reading glasses."
5,One of the Best Study Bibles Available.,"This Study Bible is a classic and in my opinion, a must own. May it never be taken off the publishing list. For anyone who is a serious student of the Word of God, Spiros Zodhiates, has made readily available an entire student's dream all in one complete edition.I have been purchasing this edition in the genuine leather edition for years (for myself and as gifts for others) and have only one area that I would like to see improved. When this Study Bible was first published, the quality of the ink printed on the pages was more rich and easier to read. However, in the recent couple of years, I have noticed the quality of the paper is thinner and bleeds through to the other side of the page and the ink is faded a little more and not as clear. Please go back to your initial higher quality. Your loyal customers will not be dissapointed."
1,Virtually worthless without the Greek-English bible,"NOTE: This does NOT have the Greek and/or Hebrew key words in the actual text, as one would suppose. Rather, there's a selected word lexicon at the end, in Greek, somewhat but not totally according to the Greek alphabet, which is virtually useless without another book: the Greek-English bible (or at least NT). This book is an almost, but not quite, complete waste of money, the only part of any value being the lexicon of selected words at the end."
2,"Boring, too repetitive","Like many of the other viewers, i found this video extremely boring . Each of the section contains literally three or four moves, and lisa keeps repeating them over and over again. After one go around, i've have enough."
1,Boring and repetitive,I read all the good reviews about the DVD and decided to try it out. I wanted to do some cardio exercises so I went straight to the salsa section. I was very disappointed because they repeated the same routine over and over again. It was very boring! I have always done step aerobics before I was pregnant and I feel that the routine is what makes the exercise fun. I didn't even want to watch this DVD again. It's a waste of money. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,"It's OK, But there are better","I was hoping for something with a little more substance. The Salsa section is entirely on your feet, so if you are experiencing any foot related issues like I am (my arches have fallen during this pregnancy), then this section lacks luster.The instructor just seems to be all over the place in general. At no time did I feel that any particular muscle group was getting attention. There were not enough repetitions at any one time to acheive a feeling of fitness.I purchased 2 other pregnancy workouts that I feel are far better than this one (if any of you are interested.) Check out ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" and ""Fusion Pilates for pregnancy"". The first gives you real challenges that are safe and the second is great for flexibility and aching lower backs."
2,Not a workout at all,"If you worked out prior to your pregnancy, this is not the DVD for you... I was very disappointed and was left waiting for the workout. Check out Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix or Niece Pecenka's Pilates During Pregnancy for a real work out."
4,Good workout video for pregnant women.,"I really enjoyed this video. Pregnant I find myself a little more uncoordinated than usual so I like that the video repeats the same moves. I did not find that I was over worked after the workout either. If I wanted to do less one day I would either do the salsa workout or the yoga workout. If I wanted more I would do both workouts. I loved the labor and delivery prep and the stretch and relax prenatal workout. This video may not be one of the videos for women who worked out everyday prior to becoming pregnant, but it is perfect for less fit women or women who only workout occasionally. I think it is a great workout and I find that after I do the workout I fell better."
5,enlightened,"I wasn't sure what exercise to do during pregnancy, but Leisa Hart really made it clear and now I feel confident with the exercises I'm doing for me and my baby. This was a spectacular workout video, i flat out loved what it meant to me and my baby. I wish I could thank Leisa in person, but if others hear my successful thoughts maybe that will inspire others to stick with it and learn more as I did, she was great and I appreciated it."
2,Good workout but really boring!,"I bought 3 prenatal exercise videos and this one is definitely my least favorite. The aerobic section got my heart pumping, I enjoyed the stretching at the end, and I like how the dvd is broken into segments that can be done on their own or as a total workout. The problem is that the aerobic and yoga sections are really, really repetitive which makes it boring to do. I did this workout once and haven't touched it since. The aerobics involve various ""mamba"" moves which are fun to do at first, but the same moves are repeated over and over throughout the 20 minute segment. The yoga section just repeats the same sequence about 6 times on each side. With so many yoga postures that can be combined in so many ways, it is a shame they chose to bore the viewer by doing the same ones throughout the entire segment. Overall, I would not recommend this video."
3,At Least the Salsa is Fun!,"The salsa section of this workout is a fun way to get moving and burn some calories. However, I found alot of the video to be very repetitive and somewhat tedious. I did not feel like I got as good of a workout as with the other prenatal videos I own. (Lindsay Brin's Second Trimester and The Perfect Prenatal Workout.) I usually choose this video off my shelf on the days when I did one of the more challenging videos the day before. I can do the salsa dance and get moving while letting my muscles recover. As far as the yoga and cooldown section, I prefer to do the yoga on the Lindsay Brin video."
2,Yawn!!,"I worked out regularly before I got pregnant, the cardio workout was extremely boring and repetitive. I would not recommend."
1,there has to be a more current dvd for pregnant women!,"now i love leisa hart, she's such a sweetheart, but this dvd is so dated! I honestly felt a little silly doing the workout. The workout itself and the music were so 15 years ago! How could they possibly make salsa lame? I think for women that were into regular excercise and fit before pregnancy there definitely has to be a better workout dvd for us. I honestly burn more calories speed walking and have a way better music selection on my ipod. I really dont recommend this dvd and if anyone would like to buy it used from me for cheap I'd be happy to oblige. Likewise, if there are more modern women out there who have any good recommendations please let me know!"
3,Only for beginners,"As an intermediate exerciser, I found the routine to be too repetitive & a bit boring. Using such few steps may be useful for beginners, though, because it is not hard to learn."
2,Less than awesome,"As much as I really wanted to love this product, the corny-ness of it kept me from it. I had hoped that there would be at least one mom who somewhat resembled me at this stage of my pregnancy, huge tummy, awkwardly large chest, and miserably uncomfortable, but all of the moms where super thin extra fit mom like the lady leading the class. It was just a huge dissapointment"
2,Salsa Dance?,"Yes, Salsa Dance is the first 1/2 of this prenatal workout video. Now, I am all for being fit, but, if you do not do much dancing prior to this, I found it a little difficult to pick it up with my belly already throwing my normal moves off. I wish I had known this was such a big part of the workout, as I was disappointed after purchase. The rest of the video shows some yoga and floor exercises that are pretty helpful. Overall, I wasn't all that pleased."
2,Not great for exercise,"I bought this because of great reviews on this site. But I was disappointed. In each segment, Leisa does the same 3 moves over and over. The salsa dance segment (cardio) doesn't give you a very good workout and is pretty boring (even for the first time you do it). The yoga segment is only 3 yoga moves; mostly just breathing exercises. If you don't normally work out (prepregnancy), then this video might be a nice way to get your body moving. But even if you are pregnant and too tired to work out extensively (as I am), I would save your money."
2,Couldn't possibly break a sweat,"I bought this DVD because of the overwhelming positive reviews on the site. I did the whole DVD, and didn't break a sweat. Maybe this would be a decent DVD for someone who has literally never exercised in their life, but not for anyone else."
3,"Good, but not great","I like this workout but I don't think it is the greatest. The salsa section is different but she only does about three moves throughout that section. I just think it is a little boring. Same for the yoga section-very repetitive. The workout is not terrible, I will continue to use it. I just won't use it alot or I will get bored."
1,Not for regular excercisers,This video may be helpful for somebody who were not very physically active before pregnancy. If you are used to excercising regurlarly this tape will probably not help you work up a sweat - not even in the latter stage of pregnancy. I get a better workout by swimming or walking than from these moves.
2,okay,"I found this video difficult. I didn't like the dance steps and I found my heart rate got over 140 while doing the tape. I really like Kathy Smith's video, easier to do!!"
5,Fun Workout,"I have been using this video during my entire 2nd trimester and I love it. It offers two different workouts depending on my mood and energy level. I do the salsa dance workout on days when I am not as energized and need a fun workout to motivate me, and I do the yoga fat-burn when I have energy and want a little more of a challenge. I also love the labor and delivery prep and the stetching sections of the workout. They are to-the-point so I can get on with my day and still feel stretched and relaxed. I would recommend this for someone who wants a comfortable, effective workout during their pregnancy. In fact, I feel that my muscles have more tone than before I got pregnant, and I've never felt like I was pushing it too hard during this workout. A great buy!"
1,Think again if you are considering this,"Aside from the steep system requirements and bad control interface, most reviews that I read fail to mention the simplistic gameplay, terrible cut-scenes and poor quality intro movies. The puzzles consist of ""explore til you bore"" and ""anything that seems out of place is important"" (yawn). The cut-scenes are no more than dialogue on top of standard playable graphics and the intro movie seems to have been done on high 8 by people who failed out of the 'blair witch project.' There is only so much joy to be garnered from watching a trenchcoat flap in no breeze. I consider this my worst purchase in years and do not plan to ever buy another product by this company again."
4,Safari LTD Great White,"Very nice toy, bought this for my four year old son, who after watching the Jaws movies fell in love with sharks. Price was fair but after playing with the movable jaw action part it stopped working the next day. luckily my daughter was able to take it apart and fix it with some ease, works good as new again. Only wish it was made of a softer plastic material instead of hard plastic. can be used in a tub or pool but does not float. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sharks. fun to play with."
1,Worst I've Ever Seen,"Purchased this kit based solely on my impressions of a different American International car kit. I was impressed with my first one, this one was abysmal. It's cheap construction will have you begging to be put out of your misery.Less than two months after installation, the light for the defroster burned out. Then, the lights for the a/c controls shorted. After removing the kit, I see that the light bulbs they use to illuminate have overheated the wiring insulation, and melted the connections.A call to the manufacturer was worthless, they basically said that they cannot do anything for me, that Amazon would have to handle it. Rather than deal with the hassle, I got a different brand from a local shop.Cheap parts - stay away."
2,Not very good at all,This movie sounded better than it was. The acting was really terrible and the whole thing would have been much better if they had used the rated R rating and shown something. Nothing really happened. It was a waste of money.
1,motion what?,I was unimpressed with this book as it deals with motion graphics that can be laid out just fine in flash 4 <without video>. It doesn't really capture what flash MX is about.
2,Very shallow pan,Pay close attention to the photo and dimensions. This casserole is much shallower than I thought it would be. It's almost like a glorified frying pan. Not a useful size.
1,terrible product - rusted in 3 days,"this product is made in china and the ""stainless steel"" is anything BUT stainless. I opened it and put it in my basement (not even outside). three days later it had begun to oxidize on the outside and inside. 5 days later it looked like an abandoned ww2 ship. I have to assume I received a faulty product, but its unexusable. The silliest $129 dollars I have ever spent. If you are looking for outdoor trash can- go with plastic---"
2,Weird,"The original mass sections are OK, but I am lost with these interventions, the first Gloria intervention sounds like those 20th century New Age experiments. What's the purpose? It really puts the CD down."
5,Fun expansion!,This expansion adds new content to the already amazing Elder Scrolls game and is a must have. The quests are more designed for fun factor and is a great add on for 25+ hours of play.
3,Not much expansion here,"The game is fine insofar as it goes with maybe one or two exceptions such as losing anything you store in one of the locations (a most unpleasant surprise), but the problem I have is the expansion is so minimal that, had I known ahead of time, I never would have bought the expansion pack. The creators of this one should have worked out a little more, pumped more iron because the expansion needs more time in the gym. Shivering Isles is a genuinely small place."
2,Disappointing,"This is a fine product, except that it was unusable. The specs say that each strip is 1640mm. One of the strips was about 8 inches shorter than the other. Another reviewer stated a similar issue. If you buy this product, check out the length before you start wrapping. Each strip should be about 64 inches."
4,pretty good cork tape,"This bar tape is pretty good. its no Cinelli, but for the price is just fine. just can't stretch it too much while wrapping, and the finishing tape is garbage. buy 3M Super 33+ electrical tape instead of using the finishing tape provided. it is stretchy and sticks great, even when cold."
5,One of my favorites!,"This is such an inspiring, uplifting, and emotional video. There's a monologue ""Go Down Death"" that makes me cry every time I watch it. It's so sweet and touching. I love every song on this DVD and the testimonies are very meaningful."
2,Too much Homecoming,"We bought this DVD mainly because No More Night, by David Phelps. That song is amazing! But it's the only one. There are many ""testimonies"", lots of Homecoming songs and NO Gaither Vocal Band. Very disappointing."
2,Great knifes...too bad they rust...,"We have had these for about a year. They are nice and simple and good for our little kitchen, but they are ""stainless"" steel and they have rust spots all over them. We are returning (hopefully) for warranty refund."
5,This game is the real reason WHY I had to buy a laptop!,"I travel a great deal for business - when I saw the person next to me on the plane playing this game , it was all over! As soon as I got home I had to go out and buy a laptop! Playing this beats writing up spreadsheets any day of the week!I have always had a love for things Egyptian, but this game is downright addictive! The MP3 music on the game is evocative of the era. Im very pleased that the makers of this game made sure to do their research AND if you turn to page 79 of the game's manual you will see a picture on the sail of the boat that they borrowed from a piece of original artwork by a very good artist friend of mine that they lifted from my site.I love the game, I've gotten alot of enjoyment and literal ""mileage"" out of it! I also recommend the Cleopatra add- on. If you get this, get that one too! ;-)"
3,Different,"Pharaoh is different, in the sense that the workers in the game tend to act randomly and can be hard to control. This game just never really clicked with me. Starcraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires, and Civilization were more enjoyable to me. But if you have played these to death give Pharaoh a try."
5,Old Reliable,"I have been playing this game for over 5 years now and I have yet to get tired of it. This game provides wonderful entertainment and allows you, as the person playing the game, to be as creative as possible. In the game of Pharaoh you are given different missions in which you have to build and maintain your own Egyptian city. Another aspect of the game that I personally just found out about is that you can custimize your own mission which means that you can choose your own guidlines in which to play."
5,Pharaoh for Windows XP?,"Does anyone know how I could get this game to function in Windows XP? I really enjoyed playing it, but I can't get it to work on my new laptop. Is there an updated version of it available anywhere? Please help!"
1,OMG ....I can't believe I bougth this book,"The mindless wanderings of a geologist who appears to be thinking about thinking about thinking about abiogenesis and telling us about trivia that happened in his lab or to some one he knew.If you are here to learn about abiogenesis,you'll love the chapter on why ther are no women mentioned in the book...pp. 187-8."
1,Tasted like sawdust,"Just starting out on the GFCF diet for my autistic daughter. She was so excited to see me unwrap this (it looks like bread!!). I had tasted it beforehand and had reservations about whether it was even edible. She took one bite, spit it out, and handed it back to me. DH asked ""how bad could it be?"". Came home, tried it, and he stuck it in the garbage bin. Yuck."
1,STALE!,I was inititally delighted with the price....but stale stale STALE! The bread was so stale could only use the 1st loaf for toast (& the 2nd & 3rd)will make stuffing with the rest. Disappointed.
1,YUCK!!!,This is the WORST tasting bread Ive EVER tasted!! It taste like crumbley WOOD chips. Im out $13.00. Everything went to the trash. I will just stick to fruits and veggies with lean meat. I know this company tried but this taste HORRIBLE!!
5,"A deep, nutty aroma of captivating example","It's like a quick shot of espresso, giving you the quality that you need without taking up too much of your time. People like me, who feel bogged down by business writing but love following stories, will connect with the small coffee shop owner, learning along the way and appreciating the story. The principles are simple, well drawn with the owner facing issues and reinforcing his ""enjoy your work and the customers will enjoy being there"". Quick reading because of likable setting, company and characters."
3,Beans,This is not a great book. It is short and sweet but general knowledge. It can serve as a great reminder but unless it is in the clearance bin don't bother.
2,Easy read but nothing new or enspiring,"Nothing new or exciting in this book. I enjoyed the easy read, but maybe I missed something as it seemed the owners of the Coffee shop were doing everything right. The consultant just told them to keep doing what they were doing. I hope they did not have to pay her very much!"
3,History,"This book is about my great-grandfather. I was talking to my grandmother a few weeks ago about her childhood and she showed me this book autographed to her by Sinnie Sinclair,her father. She is in this book as well. Being able to find this book means a great deal to me. It is a part of my family history. It is an amazing life story if you are interested in history."
5,Let's be fair,"I just read the other review & find it terribly unfair. I was given a copy of this book after the death of my son and found it very helpful. All topics concerning grief were dealt with matter of factly. As to cultural relevance, we write about what we know. I don't think Dr. Rando is saying this is the way you have to do anything. Like many things, you take what speaks to you and what you can use. It is well organized and the secions are brief. Many times you are incapable of reading long passages after dealing with a loss. It gets right to the heart of the matter. Great book."
5,buy this book,"God bless Dr. Rando for writing this book. It put into words all the crazy feelings I had after my mother's death. Dr. Rando, if you ever read this, please accept my deepest gratitude for your hard work."
2,How to go on Living when someone dies,"Fresh in my grief, I found this a hard book to read. It has a lot of text book information and probably is very helpful later in grief. But, it reads like a text book and I found it hard to process when my grief was so fresh."
5,What a relief! I'm not crazy!,"I recently lost 4 members of my immediate family. My psycholgist lent me her copy of this book to read and I quickly wanted my own copy to mark and highlight. This book, at most, may have saved my life and, at least, rescued my sanity. Upon further thought, this book, at most, saved my sanity and rescued my life!"
5,How to go on living when someone you love dies,I purchased this book for my daughters. We lost my wife and their mother about 3 years back. They state that the book has been most helpful.
4,Worth following!,"Not enough to be classifed Yaoi in Volume 1 but shows the potential in future volumes. Let's hope so. The plot has yet to be developed but the characters (the pair of potential lovers and 3 main sides) are well defined, with each having his personality and little quirks. As I look for characters more than the plot in any book, I will definitely follow this series."
2,Froggie is not a hit,My daughter did not like the big frog head..she refused to put it on..not a good buy for me...but quality was good..made very well..thanks
5,SWAT 3,"Well, I can see we have impatient child-like gamers who think that fast paced equals tactical. Oh wait! CS is tactical? Nope. Not in the pedigree of Delta Force (original) RS and RS Rogue Spear or GR. But listen, the point is that a game like SWAT 3 and 4 are meant to be played as tactical, slow paced, methodical games where the thrill comes not in killing but achieving an arm chair commando like feel to what was other wise dominated by mindless shooters.If you want K/D ratios then yeah, play CoD:YourFlavor or CS:GO other wise try enjoying a game like SWAT 3 that helped redefine the genre."
4,guide to becoming the strong person we pretend to be already,"This collection of anecdotes,helpful hints and encouragement will adapt to any form of use one wishes. It can be read cover to cover, or in a hit and miss fashion, as a research tool or all of the above. The author is not harsh, but very firmly peels away the layers of fear and self-deception we women seem so prone to. I stumbled on this author at a very low point of recovery and was immediately refreshed. The dawning realization that we are not chained to our past and we can change our future was a breath of fresh air to me. Everyone will read and interpret this book in their own way for their own situation. Some will get more help than others, but they all will be better people for having read this book."
4,This book reminds me that I do have courage,I have come to know that I am just scared of everything in life. Or at least the thought of it. Reading this book each morning reminds me that I do have some courage. This book points out ideas and reasons for courage in my life. Most importantly it tells me that I am human and that sometimes effects my ability to have courage.
4,Great management ideas!,"This book is really clear and gives plenty of examples of how and when to use his methods. Even though I have not tried it out yet since I am not a teacher yet I will just be a student teacher, it makes sense and should work. And it is very doable. It's really kind of common sense when you read it, but I'm sure it will be more difficult to break my already forming habits and practice it. But I am excited to try it out!"
5,A great book!!,This book was great! It made me feel like she was with me and made me want to help her. I felt like she was here.
5,Down to earth and simple yet insightful,"I find Stuart Wilde to be a matter-of-fact writer and he explains his thoughts and theories in plain language.It's the first book I have read of his and I think it's great! Simple messages on each page that just make you go ""oh yea!""I'll definitely look into getting other books of his."
1,"Works Great, but for how long?","Addendum (1.12.12): Ok, second one also broke within months. Unreliable product. Downgraded 1 from 4 star.I got a free one in a gift bag from a Lutron discussion panel. Worked well for a few months before it gave out (and would only dim a negligible bit). Hoping it was just an anomaly, I ordered a new one from Amazon. Like the simple iPod-ish design. Works great, when it works.Every light should have a dimmer! Just wish they lasted longer."
4,Works great,Used this to dim a small xmas tree in my kids bed room to use as night light. I mounted the switch on the wall next to the older ones bed and they loved the fact that they can control the light level. The switch has a nice red LED that allows you to quickly find it at night.
3,Nice - but doesn't include on/off,"I just bought 5 of these because a friend had given me an Ikea dimmer for Christmas lights that worked great. Lutron's a great brand and thought these would be the same. Although they seem well made, these can only conveniently be used with lamps that have a separate on/off switch. This dimmer will bring the lights down low, but not turn it off, like the Ikea did.So, I'm returning these Lutron dimmers, as I want to use them with Christmas lights, and don't want to have to unplug/replug the lights.."
5,Great dimmer works well,"Komg 6 foot cord. Quality product. Has a red led light to help you find the switch in the dark. If u need a dimmer for your lamp, this is the one."
5,"Easy, attractive and works great","Plug dimmer in, plug lamp in, and use.It couldn't be easier to turn any lamp into a full range dimmable light.We use one on each nightstand so my husband and I can have as much or as little light at bedtime.We also use these in the living areas of our home when we wish to leave a light or two on if we're away on vacation or out for the evening. It allows us to still keep the house lit and looking lived-in, without having to have lights on full power.Bonus points for the low profile, blend-into-the-background look of the control which goes unnoticed except for the handy illuminated light that helps you find it in a dark room.Highly recommended, good quality and good energy saver too."
5,Lasted about 7 years,Bought a set for our bedside lamps between 7-8 years ago. They were used daily and recently died within 6 months of each other. Not bad for the price.
5,Used for Snake Heat Pad,"I purchased this dimmer for my Corn Snakes Under Tank Heat Pad. I also used the Exo Terra Digital Thermometer with probe placed under the surface of the bedding to measure the heat from the heat pad. With the dimmer combined with the thermometer I can make sure that the heat pad is giving the exact amount of heat I want it to, no more, no less. It takes a few adjustments on the dimmer to get the pad just right, but after its set, your solid."
4,Great for bedside and the disabled.,I have one of these on the side of my bed for my lamp and for my infant son's room. Perfect for not blinding my husband! I also bought one for my disabled mother who cannot reach up to turn on a lamp. She adores it and it gives her a touch of independence! The only issue I have is there is a SLIGHT hum that emits from the unit when placed on a flat surface. I often have to place it on the side to reduce the noise.
4,These are great,"I can use a very high wattage bulb, but keep it at a low level most o the time, excpet when I'm knitting and need it very bright. Gives me lighting flexibility."
3,It's just okay if...,"Feels cheap. Contraction & design flow's:*Metal parts of the plug-flimsy,bendable.*Cable is rough, unnecessary long.*Slider/button is not fixable in position.If you've purchase it for regular lamp as a dimmer than its okay; didn't know it can't be used for a fluorescent lamps - may cause a fire! .I bought this for/as a fan speed adjuster.Well... using this dimmer with a fan - causes a loud, as a cellphone-vibrating humming noise.(Tried on 3 fans-same noise).Last option left - with 300 w halogen photo lamp;)"
3,WWE Hell In a Cell 2010 review,"The 3 way submission match for the U.S title & the Wade Barrett-John Cena match were the showstealers of HIAC. The 2 HIAC matches were boring as heck. The Edge-Jack Swagger match despite lack of build-up,was still a pretty good bout. The Unified Divas Championship match was dumb,sloppy & ruined by a DQ ending. The Biggest surprise of the show was John Cena losing thus Joining The Nexus. The PPV is not great but pretty good. I give HIAC 2010 a 5 out of 10."
5,Robert Larson Center Finder,Because it is just what my husband wanted and he uses it a lot; a neighbor man recommended this product
2,Peg-perego Tractor,It was hard too assemble.They did not even put the decals on.Also the bucket is hard to dump.It is also very cheaply built for the price. I should of bought the electric one.
2,Too much plastic,"I was disappointed, though my grandson(s) is delighted. We'll see how long his delight lasts. This John Deere tractor is made of plastic, with a few metal rods. It was challenging to assemble, as the directions were not clear. The gears only move one wheel, and are not connected to the second rear wheel.I wished I had pursued a metal version."
2,Logitech Cordless Mouse,"This is the second Logitech mouse I've tried. The first was an optical but not cordless. Both quit working after a year of use. Though I liked the way both performed while they were still usable, I have been disappointed twice by Logitech and will not buy that brand again. I have a Kensington mouse that has been working for 5 years and Microsoft opticals that go on and on. Sorry I haven't had the luck the other reviewers have had."
4,Good Quality,"This is a sturdy, excellent quality mouse. I use it together with a gel mouse pad (although it doesn't need one) and working with it is a breeze. The mouse is kind of heavy, hence you get the feeling of the mouse gliding across the pad.- You don't loose any prescision with wireless.- The sturdy construction adds weight and gives the mouse the 'gliding' effect.- USB 1.0 for a reliable 12 MB transfer speed or PS2 with the included adapter, but if you use the adapter you will loose the page scroll function in the middle wheel.- The mouse sucks up to alkaline ""AA"" batteries per month, at least. I need to keep a 10 pack in my drawer to avoid annoyances.- It's a Logitech mouse; you will only need to plug it in and the Windows system will automatically recognize your mouse and install the drivers for it (Win ME, 2000, or later).Overall I love this mouse and I would feel odd using anything else."
5,Excellent mouse,"This mouse is an excellent mouse. For years I used a regular mouse and the cord was constantly getting caught and knocking things over. I got this mouse and was amazed. It not only funtioned better, but it was corless! The buttons work great and the mouse overall has a very nice feel (and it's ambidextrous). The wheel also works well and has a middle button you can use. The batteries do NOT get eaten away contrary to what another user said. I have been using it for about 2 months and the control panel says the battery level is still good!Bottom line: one of the best mice out there. Buy it and be amazed."
3,Not exactly cordless,"I ordered this mouse after reading several of the other reviews including one or two by laptop owners. I use a laptop exclusively at home, and I like Logitech mice. I was surprised when it arrived (in just 2 days using Free Shipping!) to find that the package contained a mouse-sized RF unit that had to attach to the laptop with a cord that was as long as a regular mouse cord. All this so that the mouse itself could be ""cordless."" I immediately packed it back up and returned it and ordered another Logitech mouse (for a bit more money) that specified Notebook and showed a picture of the RF unit - looking more like a flash drive. I gave this product 3 stars because the description should indicate that the ""cordless"" mouse requires a corded send/receive unit."
2,"5 episodes of an average Superhero, average action and mediocrity that brings it down.","This motion comic is filled with an average superhero, average actions, bad writing, filler and very little movement. I didn't care for this motion comic, its too slow and boring. 2.5/10"
4,"When the ""West"" Was Fun","Last year's big-screen version of ""The Wild Wild West"" was a misguided (and miscast) revival of a classic TV series. The early ""WWW"" episodes only enhance the film's weaknesses. ""The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth"" marks the debut of Michael Dunn's inimitable Dr. Loveless - the most enduring adversary of James West (Robert Conrad). All the action-espionage elements are evident in this 1965 episode, along with the sardonic, childlike charm of Dunn's characterization. One only wishes that Artemus Gordon had an opportunity to display a few of his famous disguises (Ross Martin's talents are wasted in this particular episode). Nevertheless, ""Wizard"" remains a fine example of what ""The Wild Wild West"" was all about."
3,gift basket,Arrived in a timely matter. Not sure where went wrong but was sent to me not person gift was for.
5,CURT Manufacturing 40006 2-5/16 In. Diamet...,"I purchased this Curt ball almost two years ago, and it still looks fairly new. I was rather leary of this company being a new kid on the block, but Curt seems to make quality towing equipment."
2,Cheap! Handle doesn't stay up.,I ordered this so I could push my 1 year old. The handle does not stay up though. This is mostly a problem because you can't steer it for them.
3,Great Toy,I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he ran straight to it Christmas day. He played on it off and on all day.I like the fact you can push him until he learns to pedal himself and also use it as a rocking toy.
4,Everyone's Pretty Happy With This,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. He enjoyed rocking on it but it was a little high for him to get on and off of at first. When we switched to the 'roll' where we push him along we encountered a few problems. Thankfully, the seat adjusts but there is no way to keep their feet on the pedals or resting spot so its impossible to go very far or fast at any time. Also, the wheels are incredibly loud and get scratched up and nasty looking really fast. I am looking forward to him learning to pedal and control it all by himself. I think this is a very durable item and a great concept I would just like to see better wheels and some sort of loop or strap to keep the childs feet out of harms way."
4,Good but not great..,"We got this for our son 2 Christmases ago. I was SO excited about it. Begged my husband and finally we got it. We put it together etc. Well, our DS Loves it. He is 3 now and he is forever on that thing. The only down falls were: 1. The rocking - my son at 3 still cant rock that thing. DH or I have to help him and he doesnt like that. He wants to be able to do it and it bores him quickly. 2. The adult push handle is SO so very low. I am 5'3 and DH is 6'4. He has to stoop to push it and it even hurts my back.. ugh.. 3. We are a Military family and in the last move the pin that holds the handle on was broken. So, now DS just uses it as a bike. He still pushes with his feet though..."
2,Big wheel with a handle,"I was really hoping that this trike would be perfect for my 2 year old to go to and from the park. She hates being in her stroller while her big sister is riding a bike, so I thought this would work. It does not! If my daughter is ""riding"" the trike, peddling and turning the wheel, it is impossible to push her straight. It becomes frustrating for me and takes forever to get to the park. Plus, the pin for the handle keeps coming out so the handle doesn't stay up. This was definitely a disappointment. I have ended up taking the handle off and my girls use it like a big wheel at home. So, they enjoy it, and my little one loves having her own ""bike"" but it is not what I expected. Maybe if she was older it would work better, but for now, it stays in the backyard."
4,"Too big for the little guy, but he still loves it.","I got this for my two year old. He already has a rocking horse (which he loves!), so I didn't bother with the rocking mode of this trike. I set it up as pictured - as a trike with the tall handle. My little guy loves it, and rides it all around the house. The only trouble is that even with the seat ALL the way forward, he can still only reach one pedal at a time. When we get better weather, we'll try it outside. My biggest concern with using it as a parent-pushed, riding toy, is that I'm not sure he'll keep his feet on the footrest -- I'm afraid he'll get a foot under it, and get his ankle twisted or jammed underneath. But, I guess we'll find out when spring comes!"
4,My daughter really likes it,"Our 2 year old really likes this bike, and has a good time riding it. The design of the peddles catches her foot from time to time, resulting in a 4 rather than 5 star rating. The push handle is a great addition to prevent the bike from being carried when she gets sick of riding it!"
5,My 2 year old loves it,works great inside and out. He loves to rock and watch tv then take it out side and get pushed around the block. He almost has the pedals figured out but i would recommend this to any one with little ones
4,Durable toddler bike,"My toddler twins have been dying to ride bike with their older and brother sister, the stroller was just not as exciting. So we purchased these for their second birthday. Assembly was not terrible and the boys enjoy them already, even though they just ride around the livingroom. I love that it has a handle for me to push them, and that the seat is adjustable. The rock feature is also kind of fun! This is a toy that will be used for many many years. We had a knock off version of one of these for our older kids, and it lasted through at least 3 kids before biting the dust, this one feels much stronger, and will make it through many children, I am sure!"
4,Awesome Trike,My kid really enjoy riding this trike.You can convert into rock n roll and kids enjoy rolling on it.Remove the handle at the end and kids will enjoy more riding this trike as it becomes light weight for them to pedal and drive.
4,Must Buy,Product helps my kid to learn walking as well as enjoy while revolving around the home.Only trouble is while runing on hard surface it make noise rest all the features are remarkable good.
3,probably better when kids are a little bigger,"Right now we have it set up as the rocker but it really doesn't rock so it's more like a chair. My son is almost 18 months so maybe once he gets a little bigger he will be able to rock it. We got it on sale so i think we still got a good deal since he will be able to use it when he's a little older, it's just not so great for his age. I kinda wish I would've gotten him one of the tricycles made for 18 months and up so he could ride it now instead of having to wait a few years to really have fun with it. My neighbors' kids have one and they were riding it the other day and seemed to have fun. They are around 5-7. Their mom said that they don't play with it much anymore but I guess they were riding it because she was showing it to me to see if what we bought was the same since theirs was older."
3,Needs rubber wheels,"We have had this trike for several years. It is a good trike, except for one thing. The tires are plastic and if your child has to ride uphill or up a driveway, the wheels spin because there is very little traction on them. Our drive way is on a very small incline, but my kids have the awfullest time getting the trike up the drive way unless they use their feet to push it or get off and push from behind."
3,CAUTION: Handle Does Not Lock!!!,"My son and I spend hours playing on his Rock, Roll 'n Ride Trike and it doesn't take very long for you to see one MAJOR concern that I have for this product. When the parent handlebar is in the up position, so that you can push the child along, it does NOT lock into place. When children start to learn how to stand and climb, they tend to reach for things to grab onto, like the parent handlebar. What the children don't know is that when they pull themselves up, the parent handlebar is going to come down on them. At the same time, when they are bumping into walls and furniture while riding the trike, that annoying handlebar is constantly falling down. My son seems to love the trike, but as a parent I feel that this product is lacking safety. The parent push handlebar should have a locking mechanism (like the yellow peg on the rocking mode) so that the Rock, Roll 'n Ride Deluxe Trike is fun AND SAFE!!!Thank you,Pat Swaab"
5,Lara is a Revelation in herself!,"Tomb Raider is one of the finest action games.From the first to the latest sequel of the series interest remains alive all along.The Last Revelation is nevertheless,the most interesting compilation of elements and themes used in the past.The graphic construction of Lara is full skinned,an interesting point for all of us Lara Croft admirers! Full of action,traps and riddles that will keep your grey matter ticking.One thing is for sure:keep playing on Lara's side and you'll never grow old!"
1,Waste of Money,"I caught on to the fervor, and succumbed to the advertising blitz for this game. I was very disappointed. The graphics are good, but that should be expected for a game in 1999, when considering other 1st/3rd person games like Half-Life or Unreal. With a half-decent plot, this game could have been better, but the steep learning curve and secrets too subtle to be found without a guide turned me off immediately. I uninstalled it today and am back to playing Broodwars, out 40 bucks. Learn from my mistake and avoid this ""game."""
4,very cool game,"You know what, I don't have this game, but I played it at my sisters house. I wish they had it for Macs! I know I would get it. Anyway, it is hard, and it's definetly not for maybe 11 and under. As you can probably tell, you do have to kill things in it. So if you're a protective parent, I don't reccomend you get this for your child. But I watch my brother-in-law play it and he's very good!"
1,the headline says better reselution than a normal TV!!!!???,"how could that statement be made and not be fasle advertising, i bought this peice of junk last year before i moved to germany, i thought it would be nice to have for my many feild experience i would have in the army, i was wrong, the picture is so small, yes it is a mini tv but come on really, here is some advice go to a pawn shop, plop down 50 bucks for a used 13 inch tv. The sound, well its not that bad if you like 8 dollar discman speakers, the light on the screen is from the edges and not filterd at all so one side may get more than the other thus making a big huge white blob on your screen use your 120 bucks elsewhere"
3,It's okay for what it it !,"These screens, are good for storage and compactablity. But the game pictures it shows isn't all that great. It is usable, pictures can be grainy and dark at times. But after hooking PS2 up to a tiny TV - it's color and overall picture is so much better, for game playing. If I'd of thought of the small TV, I would not of purchased one of these screens. So,I wasted money - mini TV is better. Add'l note: It's more durable than you'd think, it was knock off a table with the PS2 system, I was worried that the screen would break - it didn't."
1,Does not worked!,Iwaited almost a month to get the product to me in Iraq and it does not work. Can i have my money back or can i have one that does work? Hope to hear from you guys. bye bye! (The sound from the speakers is great but the screen does not show anything!)
4,Best recording of Guys & Dolls,"Almost without exception, all the recordings of Guys & Dolls are very good. The most recent one (1994?) with Nathan Lane is exceptional and the original cast from 1950 also provides a great version. But, this 1976 recording is, without a doubt, the best Guys & Dolls out there. It captures all the energy and vitality of the show."
2,Missing the mark,"Black and decker really blew this one. This is a crude sloppy piece of work. It does not really do anything well but tries to do 2 or 3 things badly or sloppily. There is a much better strictly mechanical wrench sold at home depot that has all of the supposed virtues of this wrench but is of quality workmanship for the same or less money.See Crescent AC8NKWMP 8"" Rapid Slide Adjustable WrenchThe above review applies to an older model currently in stores which is improved but not enough. Grit & stuff in the work place clogs up the switch and the mechanism so that you have have compressed air to blow it out and keep it working."
3,"Black & decker 8"" auto wrench","Pretty good tool,however as a contractor my tools don't lead a easy life. I have been using this tool for several months and it has been adequate at best. It is not sturdy enough to put up with the abuse some of my other tools have survived. I feel it is more geared to a home repair situation than a professional type tool. I can only give it a limited recommendation, but it is a neat tool to have in your tool box."
1,Broke after very little use,I received this a few years ago as a gift and have only used it a few times. I went to go use it today for the first time in over a year. I heard the motor turning but the jaws didn't move. Put fresh batteries in but had the same problem. Opened the unit and found the belt that runs from the motor to the mechanism was broken. This has received very little use and yet is broken and now in the trash.
1,A Piece of Garbage,"Handle is to big to be a small wrench.Jaws don't open enough to be a big wrenchBattery died within a week.Zero stars, if I could pick zero."
4,Nice!,"My husband likes this alot! It is worth it. Only thing is don't leave it outside when it is cold, or it will not work well until it warms up."
2,Black & Decker Auto Wrench,"I bought this item for my Husband for Christmas, he said it was junk. The battery went out the first week, it was dye cast and looks cheap, I'm sorry I relied on the picture to provide a nice description of a present. Had I known it was so cheap looking I would have never purchased it."
3,Not so great for cold garages...,"Does not function at all in the winter. Like most people, I keep my tools in the garage. I'm not sure if the flaw is in the wrench or the cold batteries, but the auto functionality does not work when the wrench is kept in the cold. When used manually, the wrench is difficult to work with as the clamps move slightly making quick relocating of wrench impossible."
2,"Good idea for a beginner, but there are better options...",Recieved as a gift but found the motor too weak for my tastes. Returned it and boughtCrescent AC8NKWMP 8-Inch Rapid Slide Adjustable Wrench- much better (and stronger) one handed adjustment without using a battery.
5,The best wrench ever!,"I bought this wrench for my dad for Father's Day. He uses it for everything. And, it's so easy to use! I was even amazed at how well it works and tools don't impress me much at all. This tool is perfect for any handyman... or handywoman, for that matter. And, of course, I found it here when I couldn't find it anywhere else!"
4,Handy tool.,I bought this wrench for my self and liked it so much I gave one to my on his birthday. It's real handy for kids bikes and jobs where changing the wrench size is necessary. I haven't had it long enough to comment on its durability.
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Heck's mom is lost. She disappeared after they were locked out of their apartment because she couldn't pay the rent.

1,Pricing Error?,I have to echo prior comments. I just came to Amazon hoping I could buy candy melts by the case (as they sell many other food items) and pay much less than the $2.99/bag I can in stores locally. There is no way this $6+ price is correct. It says it's for one bag. It can't possibly be correct. Who is going to pay 2-3 more for one bag? I hope this is fixed soon as I'd love a source for these online for less in bulk.
3,"product OK, but arrived melted","I purchased these for cake balls at a party and got them through Amazon because they offered the best price. They arrived in good time, but they were completely melted and starting to ooze out of the packaging. I figured they would have been mailed with a chill pack or something, considering they came from Arizona to Texas in June. Ayway, I returned them for a refund. The product itself is great. I ended up getting them at Hobby Lobby (cost more, but they weren't melted!) and they worked out just fine."
3,We'll see...,"It's hard to say whether the ""quality"" has been sustained...I haven't used the melts yet. However, when they arrived, they had apparently melted into one big block. The biggest issue I had was that I purchased these to put in a gift basket. I've been able to break the block up a bit but not entirely and the candy looks discolored. We'll see if it melts properly when she uses it."
1,A Messy Waste of Time,"I had heard good things about Wilton Candy Melts, but my experience couldn't have been worse. I had intended to dip pretzels in one color and drizzle them with a second. They melted to a thick, sticky consistency, impossible to dip anything much less drizzle. After having trouble with the first batch, heated according to directions in the microwave, I switched to the second method, the stove top double boiler. Same problem. The second bag I'd bought went into the garbage can, unopened. I'll never use them again."
3,Digital Show Radio,"This product works fine for the cost. However, I had a really difficult time opening up the back to put in the batteries and the power/volume knob is difficult to turn, especially when your hands are wet. The clock feature is not very useful, numbers are too small. I do like the fact that you can preset radio stations."
4,great game with a few flaws,Wonderful game where the difficulty is pretty consistent with your progress although it's frustrating with some golfers that have a natural curve and you don't know how to compensate for it. Some of the character comments during versus mode are a little weird but sometimes downright annoying and repetitive. The second wave of characters is tougher and seem to get lucky breaks even more often than their counterparts.
2,hot shot golf 3,I bought this as a present for a friend. I have a prevous version (Playstation 2 Hot Shots Golf Fore)which includes two mini golf courses. I found this newer version not as much fun and it seems to have less features.
5,"Balls, Clubs, Characters, and Physics....SUPERB!!","Hot Shots Golf 3 for the PS2 is probably the best golf game out there on the market. In addition to beautifully designed courses, the physics of golfing are truly captured to provide a vivid feeling to the slopes and bumps of the green, the helpful yet sometimes detrimental wind, and even the trouble of the sand trap. Hot Shots Golf is a game worth purchasing, even for the most avid golfer. I highly recommend this game to everyone."
2,"Bright light, short life.",They produced a nice bright white light. But the first one failed on me last week after 7 months.I average 500 miles a week andmost of that is lights on but the original bulbs lasted over 3 years. So 2x's price of standard bulb and 1/4 the life = 8x's the cost. Not even close to worth it. If I knew ahead of time I would have skipped them.
2,"Horrible ""Variety""","While the price is still good for 100 Durex's, the description should be changed to a more accurate representation of the ""variety"" we're dealing with here. In my package I got:26 Regular Latex26 High Sensation24 Maximum Love26 Her PleasureI dont know what High Sensation or Maximum Love condoms are. I was expecting the contents to look a little more like the product picture, but that is 100% deception."
1,It won't let me give it less than one star.,"Stay far away from this modem. It drops your connection about 5 times an hour. Then when reconnecting it may take you 15 trys before you actually get connected. Then to top it off, the speeds are the slowest I've found. After working as a tech support person for an ISP for years, I've figured I've seen bad modems in my time, but this one is the worst. You would be better off using tin cans and string"
5,Alexandra Barreto was awesome!,People have overlooked actress Alexandra Barreto's performance in this series. She is an up and coming actress with an amazing acting ability!
4,Good but not great,"Really my rating is more like 3 1/2. This was pretty good throughout, with brief flashes of excellent prose. This won the Edgar? All I can say is that 1994 must have been a really thin year for mystery."
3,A bit old-fashioned if I may...,"A nice looking little book but frankly, I should have looked at when it was first published...1997 you say ? So maybe is Emilie Barnes getting a bit 'off' the real world nowadays...It certainly is a dream book for grandmothers who wish to get invited by their grand-daughters for a tea party...surely did not ring a bell with my own (yet adorable but within her own style) daughter. For nostalgic people only."
4,Gift for a 6 yr old girl,"I bought my grandniece a tea set and this book for Christmas. I told her grandmother about the gift and explained that there was a section in the book for a tea party for granny and Em. My sister was delighted with the idea. Growing up, my sister, my mother and I had a tea party at 3pm every Sat. afternoon. We even had pretend names. It's a wonderful memory."
2,Still waiting on results...,"I am not sure that I would order this product again. I have only been using it for a week, so I have not seen any results yet. It appears as if my product had the expiration date scratched off and the tube had been handled before (tube was bent). Hopefully I did not lack too much wisdom by using it anyway. I will follow-up in a month with any results that I may/may not see."
4,Just got it,"I just received this item in the mail. I liked the price so I thought I would give it a try. The product took a long time to get here. Although it did arrive before it was supposed to, waiting a month to get it is a bit ridiculous.When I first opened the product I was surprised how little there was, but I soon discovered you really don't need very much to apply to your face. Just a small dot in the morning and a small dot in the evening. It goes on as a darker tinted lotion. It has a pleasant smell and feel to it. So far I think it is working. My complexion looks more even. I think its a good product and I am going to continue to buy it."
5,This is the best game for the PC by far,diablo 2 adds on to the gretaness of its predecessor the original diablo. it has all new character classes and new weapons too. youll probably lose hours of sleep over it and probably a girlfriend on the way
5,It's like a drug...,"I get on the computer as soon as my kids are asleep, and when I go to bed, I still see the scenes behind my eyes. My fingers twitch all day long with the urge to leave work early for just a little more game time... The graphics are Great - a lot of imagination went into making things look interesting. The world is HUGE! and I love the fact that it's split up into four acts. I have caught a glimpse of some of the screen shots from acts II, III & IV and can hardly wait to get there myself... Buy this game - it's worth the money!"
3,Good for a couple weeks...,This game is ok for a few weeks but then it becomes a real bore and is a total waste of money
1,Totoro speaks on Diablo II,"I don't know why I bothered to try Diablo II. I didn't particularly like Diablo I so I should have known....Fortunately, I did not buy the game (only played). Very little rp in rpg. The plot is long, one-dimensional and pre-ordained. I did not finish because I fell asleep, though I heard about what happens when you do. No surprises. If you have absolutely nothing better to do, it will pass your time, but I recommend something with a little more depth. Of course, the artwork was up to the standards you would expect (pretty good, that is, in a morbid sort of way)."
1,"Fun, but frustrating!","I have to say the only thing wrong with this software is its lack of quality control. I own a TNT card, and even after the 1.01 patch and the new drivers for the card, it is still buggy. Coupled with a new save feature that respawns all your enemies when you save. Blizzard needs to fix the bugs and the save features, because after crashing every 10 min, you would be upset."
3,it dragged my GPA!,"well, what else can i say about this? my gpa this semester is only b plus. although it's acceptable in a graduate school, i really don't like it.but the game is a great fun indeed!"
1,"defective graphics, shoddy customer service","I haven't yet actually been able to play Diablo II. The installation went fine, and the opening movie held so much promise...but the screen that appeared immediately after was so garbled I couldn't make out what it was supposed to be.I contacted Blizzard's tech support, fully described the problem and provided them with the system information they requested on their convenient on-line form, and waited for the answer they promised would be delivered shortly. And waited. And waited.I wrote to them again, citing their own website's claim of their commitment to quality products and the satisfaction of gamers in an attempt to goad them into demonstrating that those claims weren't a hollow marketing ploy.I've been waiting for a reply for a month. If what they truly intended to demonstrate was their contempt for their customers, they've done an admirable job of it."
4,"Great, incredibly addictive","You will not be able to stop playing this game. I swear! I still go back and run through it, just to try out a new character, or to try another tactic somewhere, or test out the skills in new ways. The only thing that took some getting used to was the saving system, since it puts you back in town."
1,Multi player is horrible,"this game could be good but blizzard was so unprepared for the launch there servers can't handle the load so you crash, become disconected, or can't even connect. You spen more time trying to play than actually playing."
1,"What, I cant give it negative number of stars?","Actually my rating would be -5. Why? Because not all games were manufactured equal. Mine was missing several files when I put it on my PC. No matter how many bunches of times I reinstalled it, it kept crashing. Diablo II would make a great game, if I could play it for 5 minutes without it crashing. In multiplayer, when it crashes, the multiplayer game will think its a cheat...and it will reset the characters back to their normal status before they entered the game. This copy was bought legally at Target. In summary, Diablo II is 3 disks full of massive glitches."
4,Diablo 2 review,"This game has an intrguing story line coupled with an expansive world to explore. Although it is becoming quite dated, particularly the graphics, the game is still fun."
2,Great 1 player game,"If you liked Diablo 1 and you arent buying this game to play online, then you will like Diablo II. This game isnt dificult, it just involves completing certain quests. After a while you arent really playing the game as much as you are just trying to run down the checklist of things you have to do. So its a great way to kill time I guess. I tried to play online but I cant stay on long enough to complete any of the quests. ..."
3,This is a good game,"I have been playing this game for about a month now. It only took a week or so to beat it, but since then I have re-started it countless times trying to revise the way I evolve my character. Although I think this is a great game and worth the price, I feel there is something missing to the story line. The episodes that you get to watch as you progress through the game are done extremely well, and I have watch them several times in awe of their attention to detail. But besides the episodes there was no story line to follow or maybe it was just assumed (did not develop along the way). But that didn't stop the fun, and the internal desire to figure out how to evolve the greatest charter and try out all their abilities, with limitless possibilities (I'm gonna be awhile). Which has caused me to lose a lot of sleep and start this game over and over. It's a good thing I don't have a life, :)."
3,a good miscellany,"This little anthology offers a good introduction to the Celtic saints through a combination of sketches of their lives, excerpts from the writings of the saints themselves (stories and prayers), stories about them by commentators such as Bede and others, and many prayers from the Carmina Gaedelica and other sources. The introduction treats of the early Christian history of the British isles. It would make a good first read in this area, and thus would be a great gift for birthdays, graduations, and other holidays. It has a durable cover for lots of handling, and it should be handled often!"
2,"Music is a little flat, Back cover is not original.",Music is not as sharp as the original album. Also most important if you are looking for the back cover notes then this is not the disk for you. I have the original album and it is one of the first burns of this artist. The back cover has the original notes from John Small from WKNR-FM Detroit. The back cover notes are extremely important to anyone who wants to know the whole story on this group. I suggest you look else where for the true sound of Rare Earth. If possible the 33 1/3 album is a must for any collector and the music is extremely sharp and clear. Better than any digital disk will ever be.
2,"Not bad, but what happened to the old Hiram?","A good Latin style release, but I miss the early Hiram, the Hiram that made scorching yet melodic guitar leads like no other and had a fusion bent that was jazzy and rocky. I am desperately searching for a copy of ""From All Sides"", but can't find it."
2,Could have been better,"I recently gave a 1-star review to this book, but some sort of guilt hit me and I decided to look through the book again to see if I could find some way to up my rating. Well, the author could try putting in a CD with pictures that are included in the book so the buyer could practice the lessons; and a different layout that would be more pleasing to the eyes wouldn't hurt either.So does this book have some merit? Yes. Is it the best book on Photoshop retouching? No.This book is going to have trouble competing when so many other books include hands-on tutorials via a CD. The positive behind this book is it's not lengthy, and how I hate buying a book the thickness of the Yellow Pages.So who would buy this book? Someone who is heavily into using Photoshop and has purchased just about every book there is on Photoshop.It's not the best, but it's not the worse."
1,Not for the professional or the beginner,"From the title of the book, you would expect some useful information on what is, a specialized subject. I found this book: 1. Poorly laid out - Printing very large, little or no content on the particular subject under discussion 2. Oversimplified - To the extent that you are told of a function, and asked to press the button and see what effects you can get! 3. Poor quality examples - No colour 4. No CD rom (to follow examples) 5. No advanced techniques covered, in fact no discussion at all about history brushes, adjustment layers, curves, tonal adjustments, very limited on layers, masks, etc.A very disappointing purchase to the point where I have returned the book and intend to purchase another. Buyer beware!"
1,Not the best at all!,I have had photoshop for about a year now and I seen this book and thought that it would help me a lot more with understanding the different aspects of the program. When I recieved it I was extremely dissapointed! It was all stuff I already teached myself and the different ways they pictured what they done after they worked with the photo was poorly done! If I would have known that this is what it was going to consist of them I would have never wasted the time and money in trying to get it!
3,Buyer is absolutely on time,"I received the book in time with a personal note from the owner and I think that she is absolutely nice. Though the book did not carry it's CD, (which I am hoping to be able to get it still in the mail), I think that she was a good seller. Thank you Amazon.com for such a good deal."
4,"Good, but many errors","This book is a great general introduction to NLP, covering a broad range of topics. Unfortunately there are many errors in the mathematical formulae and the algorithm descriptions, so do make sure to download the errata list from the book's home page."
3,Looks like a good book,"I'm almost a quarter of the way through this book and am very happy with it so far. It covers a lot of territory, including both text and speech. Which means it cannot go too deep, but in most cases I have another book available to give the nessisary depth (Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)is a good companion."
4,"older edition, cheap and helpful","The only problem I have with this book is that a bit verbose. I also wish that it would get a bit more into the mathematics of HHMs and provide better examples.Hopefully the new Edition, has taken care of this short coming."
