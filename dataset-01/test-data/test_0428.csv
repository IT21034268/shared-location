5,Must have for anyone interested in Medieval and Crusades History,"If you are seriously interested in the final days of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Crusades, then you should read this one. The so called ""Templar of Tyre"" is a contemporary witness of the fall of Acre in 1291 and the trial of the Templars.This is real History. If you look for holy grail, royal blood lineage, hidden treasures or similar matters you won't find here..."
5,You are a goddess Ms. Austin,"Even though I usually shy away from anything labeled 'romantic'. What a great novel! I am on my second copy due to an unfortunate bathing accident. Jane is witty, smart and her writing never gets tiresome. Wherever you are Jane, thank you!"
4,pretty good,"I would have been much happier if the manufacturer had packed this in a roll rather than folded up, leaving rows of wrinkles. I hosed it off, which helped only slightly, then bent each fold in the opposite way, to further remove them. I don't want my little 4 & 6 lb pets to trip on the liner's wrinkles."
3,just ok,"pretty good deal, but it is square rather than rectangular. this means that it really doesn't cover the entire back area if you put your seats down. I've used and washed mine a number of times since I transport rescue pets from shelters. There is velcro tabs on two ends to help keep it in place."
1,No good,"I was very disappointed with this product. It did not meet my expectations at all. It claims to be ""waterproof"" but it is not. I had this liner in the back of my Tahoe after receiving it, and a few days later I went to the store to get groceries. By the time I got home, the milk sweated and the condensation had went clear through this liner, soaking the carpet beneath it. I would. OT recommend this product."
5,Fits good,"I purchased this along with a pet barrier. It is water proof and works well for puppies. My intent was to save my carpet and this cargo liner does the trick. the liner has velcro tabs which allow it to be placed on the back of the seats. I like it, good product."
5,Great for car backseats too!,"Bought this for the backseat of my Ford Focus because I can't use the ones with hooks in the backseat, and I love it! Has velcro on the outer edges so it sticks to the seats and stays in place. Has had 2 rowdy, mudcaked mutts on it and not a speck of dirt has gotten on my seats. Absolutely perfect, love this product!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"With all due respect to the author, this book shouldn't have been published in the first place.1. The author is mistaken about the basic concept of data encapsulation, and insists on using accessor functions to access class data members in class member functions (copy constructor, operator=, etc.).2. The author uses lengthy (yet trivial) programs to illustrate the concepts, when a code snip would suffice."
4,Solid Unit But Only Comes With 40 Watt Bulbs,"The fixture itself is well built and works as advertised. The speed and sound adjustments work very well. The only flaw with it is the bulbs. The unit I received only came with 40 Watt bulbs instead of the advertised 60 Watt ones.I also have a Chauvet Color Bank which came with the 60 Watt bulbs. The Chauvet bulbs are a little more deeply colored than the Eliminator ones, and the light output is just a tad bit brighter.Overall I would recommend the Chauvet Color Bank as it can be found for the same price. If Eliminator were to upgrade the bulbs then I would consider it a 5 star product too."
2,not great,"I bought these for a trip down the Grand Canyon - I didn't even take them, borrowed a couple of thermarests instead. Although they are very light, they have almost no padding and I imagine they'd be useless on a rocky surface."
1,still dont have parts dont know what happend,i would like to know how come i have not gotted parts yet call me 805 896 7330
3,Could have been better..,"Its good for the price but its a lil misleading in the picture..the silver beads which are in between the ink bue beads really stand out as compared to the displayed picture,the shell cud have been finished better, but i guess in the end u get what u pay for .."
3,Ok book on great subject,"Wonderful topic, but I found Rosenberg's writing oversimplistic. There were too many generalisations for me to really enjoy this book.I recommend Remnick's Lenin's Tomb and Funder's Stasiland instead."
1,Doesn't Work,"Item was shipped promptly but would not work. Called for assistance and was told it was my drivers, the cable can't be bad. The drivers they supplied didn't work and I downloaded many different drivers and none would work."
4,not yet,"neat cable, good connectors, but haven't established communications between PC and cellphone with cable yet."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I ordered this based on reviews. I have tons of Celtic CDs and this is simply bland, bland, bland. Pretty songs, pretty voice, but NOTHING remarkable....definitely a waste of MY money."
5,5 Star Look at Learning the Game!,"Bench imparts his knowledge of the game well in this book. Each chapter is devoted to a different aspect of baseball and is full of informative tips. I'm a casual fan and I learned so much reading though this book.I learned about different pitches, offensive and defensive strategies, what each player's important jobs on defense and offense are, and how the manager tries his best to win the game.There are also sections at the end of the book containing a glossary of baseball terms, all-time records, and a list of Hall of Famers.I always admired Bench as a player; now I realize Bench is an excellent student of the game as well."
5,Great knife!,"The knife is well built, high quality, light weight, and sturdy. It has a fine sharp edge. The handle feels and fits well in my hand. It's the best pocket knife I've owned. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or buy another one."
5,Good value,"This item was made in China. However, the steel, and the fit and finish is quite a bit better than other ""bargains."" Recommended."
5,THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE,"Of the few things I can remember loving as a kid, this was my favorite.I grew up around Fort Campbell, where Apaches and Longbows are an everyday sight. I loved this game. Realistic, Fun, Challenging and the Music was amazing.Read the instructions other users put to play it. It may be old, yes. There are games with better graphics. But graphics don't mean a thing if the gameplay sucks."
1,"Terrible heater, Super Super loud","We actually want to buy this heater for our baby room. But when we turn this heater on, our baby wake up and crying because it's so loud. Don't recommend to buy."
1,super noisy,"i have no idea what makes the heater so noisy. i was using a different type heater which was pretty quiet. This one turns out to be a whole different noisy heater. furthermore, even if you turn to the low power the noise doesn't decrease at all. although it does provide reasonable heat i don't recommend any of you buy it."
1,no good,This heater did not last a month (with minor use). Don't waste your money. It began making loud rattling noises and then died. A one star rating is generous for this piece of junk!
3,Flatfoot Fox's case,"I just read a great book called Flatfoot Fox and the Case of Nosy Otter, written by Eth Clifford. It was a good book. It had a lot of funny parts in it. Did you know that Flatfoot Fox is the smartest detective in the world? I would recommend this book for ages 7,8,9,10 If you like mystery books you would like this book."
2,Infant mortality a real problem,"I have had a huge problem with early failures of this unit. If they last the first couple of weeks they will work for years. I recently had to replace 3 at once due to an internal clock deciding they all had to be replaced. Since they were all installed on the same day, they all failed on the same day.I ordered replacements. Two are still working, one failed a week later. I replaced that one with another, it failed a week later. Third time may be the charm. We'll see."
1,Cannot remove unit from base,"Prior to installing the smoke detector I wanted to make sure I knew how to put it on and remove it from the plastic base that mounts to the ceiling or wall. It was very easy to put on the base, but impossible to get it off without breaking the base. Which is what I had to do to separate the pieces. I review the instructions to figure out what I had done wrong with this extremely simple process. I found I had done nothing wrong. It's just a poorly designed product."
4,Easy to install,I like that this is a smoke detector & carbon monoxide detector in one. It was easy to install. I am glad it takes batteries because I did not want to deal with wires & having to have someone install it for me. I do wish that the battery compartment was on the front of the device. You will need to twist it off the ceiling/wall mount to access the batteries on the back. But it does twist on & off easily
3,Died With Its Warranty,"Previously owned (same) model quit working almost to the day its Warranty ran out. But for the money, this one seems... ""OK""."
5,No wiring required,"I have replaced all the smoke alarms in my house with the combination alarms from Kidde but most of my alarms are wired and the battery serves as a back-up in case of a power outage. I bought this one for my utility room since it is adjacent to a bedroom, that has no detector, and no power source to which I can connect it like the kind I bought for the rest of the house. It works well -- loud; one can test it easily and reset it. Like all carbon monoxide detectors, it needs to be replaced after 7 years but it is worth the peace of mind to have this detector monitoring the furnace and water heater to ensure there is no danger."
1,"Not reliable, not recommend","After reading a few reviews on Amazon, I went for Kidde (smoke & CO) in Jun 2010. Unfortunately, it start to chirp every 30s in Jan 2011, only 6 months from first use. And nobody respond the inquiry of replacement. Won't go for this brand any more."
4,Works well so far,"It should have been manufactured within a year of purchase. Not sure if Kidde will replace one within the 5 year warranty period because the sensor's usable life has ended. Product works well, but the usable life of the sensor is 7 years or less. That appears to be normal for this type of detector, but you should check the date it was manufactured to estimate how long it will last."
3,Kiddie KN-COSM-B fire/CO alarm,"fire alarm very sensitive and loudhush feature button is also button for test.The directions didn't specify how to press the button to activate Hush feature, (i.e. press and hold until activated, quickly press and release to activate, or some other way). Three out of four times I tried to activate the hush feature for the fire alarm when the alarm went off from using the oven, the test feature activated instead of the hush feature.No CO alarms yet, that's good, but no safe way of verifying it will work when I need it to."
5,great protection,"Easy to install, protedts family with both fire and carbon dioxide detector. Long lasting battery helps keep it working longer."
2,Problem with early model?,"I purchased 4 KN-COSM-B alarms in 2005, not realizing they were ""old stock"" manufactured in 2001-2002. I was not too concerned about the batteries not being fresh, after all you are supposed to change your alarm batteries frequently. However, after 3 years one of the alarms (mfg in 2001) began to chirp without the ""low battery"" message, indicating a failure. New batteries and a reset did not help. I contacted Kidde and they sent me a new replacement. Now a second of the original alarms (mfg in 2002) has the same chipring problem and Kidde again offers a replacement. No telling yet how long the replacements will last, but at least for the early models, about 7 years from manufacturing date is the useful lifetime."
1,Can't be any worse...,"I only watched about 1/3 of this film. Extremely boring with episodes from different ages about women flirting with men. No story, just fragments all on one topic. Nothing funny at all.Michelle Mercier fans watch out: she only appears in the first episode for about 15 mins and that's it. This movie isn't about her."
1,Not what I expected at all...,"This step sucks. If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step. I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it. It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step. It ends up being VERY close to a basic step. I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout. DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club. I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor. If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one. Otherwise, don't buy anything."
4,great little knife,I agree wholeheartedly with all the other reviews. I have actually bought 3-4 of these (they r small and ez to lose). I only wonder why Amazon has a $25.00 price as this knofe is on Amazon and others for $10-12.00...
5,EDC,"Sharp out of the box. This knife is thin and lightweight, perfect as an every day carrier. I can get the blade out with one hand. It holds an edge for an eternity. Great knife, I'll buy another one eventually."
2,Disappointing !,"The majority of the information in this large book is already published in this authors EODR: Essential Oil Desk Reference. Very little new information and thus it should have been printed in a small volume or pamphlet as an addendum to the EODR. Much better to spend your money on the origianl and very valuable reference manual (the EODR) for all those using the Young Living Essential Oils. Only the ""true believers"" and followers can or will use this current volume."
4,Gerber Microlight LST Fine,"This item was exactly as described, I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
4,Nice little keychain knife for the price,"Nothing wrong with it at all. It's a tiny little thing (about as big as a mini swiss army knife when closed) and it doesn't cost very much at all. Anyone that is disappointed was expecting too much.It weighs almost nothing at all, and at the very least makes a cool little addition to your keychain or a low-price gift."
4,A good source in combination with other texts.,"Considered outdated by some, this book by Steele helps me in a nurturing capacity for understanding IDL lisp (ICAD Design Language by KTI). When used in combination with books by Graham and others, a good reference work when attempting to find specific keywords and constructs to solve isolated coding problems. It may fall a little short on examples but this is expected due to the original purpose of the text. All in all, a must for your lisp library."
3,good moisturizer,"very rich and effective moisturizer, but takes a while to melt the gritty texture and has a very strong perfume-y aroma."
2,it worked great for about 4 hours,This light worked great for about 4 hours then a couple screws came loose inside and pulled some of the wires apart. I purchaced is several months ago and didnt use it until out Christmas house party. Wish I had a recipt and did a good test right after I got it.
3,Good item,"This lighting is good for the price. It has a good hard casis, but the LIGHT is very poor. Don't work very fine in shinning places."
1,WRONG ITEM,The item received was 1/2 Inch cut instead of what was ordered - 5/8 inch cut. The order receipt and invoice on the shipping package stated 5/8 inch but the item in the package was 1/2 inch.
5,An essential component for a perfect manicure!,"I got a small sample of this for free and absolutely adored it!! I bring it to the salon with me; it works MUCH better than that can of so-called ""professional"" nail spray that nail techs normally use. No more smudges, weird ripples or seatbelt imprints that I usually get when I leave the salon too soon. I haven't had any problems with it dulling the shine of my manicure so I'm not sure what that other reviewer was talking about. I will say however, that it tends to try the skin above the cuticle (like, after spraying and waiting, there's a whitish pall to wherever the spray hit). But I think that's easily rectified -- since my nails are totally dry, I can put lotion on with no worries!Overall, an awesome product."
2,best smelling top coat option,"I really liked this spray at first, but like some other reviews have mentioned: it hasn't been working as well with passing time. For the price (around $10) I was hoping for a better product. It smells great and I still have 1/2 a bottle left, however I find the rapid dry polish to work better for me these days."
2,Failed,I am a DJ and have used this product for a year and half and the nine pin plug failed. You have to wiggle the end to make it work. I would not recommend this product.
3,Cute Cow,"This little cow is a nice little stuffed animal that makes ""mooo"" sounds. While it doesn't walk, it's cute."
3,creme brulee torch,I had a little trouble at first getting it to work. Now I love it. It is hard to see the fuel level though.
2,too big a flame,"this torch works, in that1. it lights2. safety features work3. the lock on worksbut the flame is too big, even when adjusted to the lowest level.It is so large as to be unsafe.this is not overfilled, but usual fill volume operationalso the air mix adjustment requires you to hold it in position, so it is not useful"
5,Great addition for the kitchen,This torch is the perfect size. It has it's own built in stand which makes it convenient for displaying on counter. It's easy to fill and the gauge is a nice added touch. It fits good in the hand. Easy to light and regulate the amount of fllame. Good quality and the price was right.
5,Hit the Afterburners!,"I ordered this torch because it looked like a quality piece that it would produce a nice fat, hot flame. I did not order it to make creme brulee, but ended up making it the second day I bought this, because it is such a joy to use. On its highest setting the visible flame extends out a good 8-9 inches. The flame this thing produces is serious, folks! I find that somewhere in the middle is best for creme brulee. The quality appears to be fantastic and it really feels great to hold in your hand. I saw a few people seemed to have complaints about ignition in the reviews. I have yet to have mine fail to light a single time. If you have this issue id imagine it could be an issue of the quality of butane you are using. I am using ""Benzomatic"" brand butane and I know Zippo brand butane is also very good. Love this thing!"
4,Works Great! But doesn't come with Butane,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas, since she is getting into the whole fire and baking craze. She absolutely loves it, and it really does work great. The only problem, which others have mentioned on here, is that mine did not come with butane. Now, I've never bought butane before, and I couldn't find any decently priced Prime options on Amazon, so I went to Home Depot to find some. What, a, mess. I finally found where the Butane was supposed to be (after asking customer service who had no idea), and the one package of it they sold was out of stock. Luckily they had a neat stick lighter for sale with a refill of Butane, so I bought that to use on this.So, in summary: great product, but make sure you know where to find butane! (Or Amazon, get some nice options on Prime!)"
5,Easily one of the best...,"Easily one of the BEST flamenco movies I've seen in a long time. Top knotch sound production, etc. I enjoyed it all. Cheers to the Carmona family, and Michael Mert for a job well done"
5,Great thumb ring for someone whose not a fanatic,"I really like the ring. I am not a jewelery person, I've always hated earrings and rings. I never wear anything that I can't wear with everything, all the time. But. . . I put this on and I think it fits perfectly. I googled ring sizes to figure out mine. It is loose enough to move up and down, but it doesn't go slip past my thumb joint. If I need to remove it the easiest way is soap and water. I like thumb rings because I box and do martial arts and when I punch, the ring doesn't get in the way. The design is pretty as well. It goes with everything so I never take it off. I recommend."
4,A great entry level home theater package,"I was looking for a small system for my master bedroom. Thought I'd be buying something cheapo until I discovered the YHT-150. I never thought I'd get Yamaha quality for such a low price.I have not been disappointed. It has plenty of inputs, looks handsome, and the sound is great. The remote works my Sony TV, JVC DVD, and JVC VCR without a problem. If you are looking for an inexpensive home theater, I don't think you can beat it.I only rate it 4 stars because it does not switch S-Video, and the sound (while very good) is not as full as the Bose speakers I have in the family room. OK, maybe that's really not a fair comparison given the price difference. The fact that I dare draw a comparison should tell you how good this system is."
5,The Bosses,"""The Bosses"" is an informative and entertaining book.This book shows the ""hidden stories"" that these power brokers rarely revealed to the public from Huey Long of Louisiana to Frank Hague of New Jersey."
2,Good knife until the blade breaks!,"I had this knife on my belt everyday for 3 months. I used it frequently to cut rope, vines, sharpen sticks, etc. It was a great knife and I even worked it enough where I could flip the blade open one-handed. Then I dropped it onto a 2x4 from waist high, and the tip of the blade broke off, half an inch worth, rendering it mostly useless. I have not bought a Gerber since. If you want a multi-tool, Gerber is a good option, but if you want a trustworthy knife, I'd look at Spyderco or maybe a Kershaw."
4,great knife,"I just got my Gator and it is awsome, felt great im my hand, pirfect size, easy to open and close."
3,Too gaudy & too heavy of an ornament,"I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this. I was looking for a good LA ornament since my boyfriend's is collecting them. When I got this in the mail, I thought of returning it. I decided to keep it and will be giving it to her and will let her decided what she wants to do with it."
1,fan from the old days,"On CLIFF 'EM ALL they say they don't want to release a typical s**t home video. THEY LIED, this dvd is proof. Their albums kinda sucked after ""JUSTICE"" anyway. And they really sucked after ""THE BLACK ALBUM""."
1,no Closed Captioned included,"No Closed Captioned, or subtitles, for this DVDSome of my music DVD's from almost 10 years ago have it.Flat no more excuses anymore, its 2007 now!!F+ on this DVD just for thisThanks James and Lars"
5,"Great book! Common sense, easy to comprehend!",This book works! I bought the first edition years ago and just bought the 3rd edition as a gift for a freind. The advice works! It is written in clear language. The author does not try to intimidate the beginner. He is trying to make the reader feel confident that they can do this too!This was my first investment book. Many more have followed but this one influenced my life the most. Great book!
5,History rewritten,"As you read this book, you might think that Kamal Salibi is a police detective rather than a historian. Employing his sharp analytical skills and his perfection of semitic languages, Salibi provides an interpretation of parts of the Old Testament that is by far, different from most of the versions that we've read or heard.This is the second book based on Salibi's hypothesis which has it that the events of the Old Testament did not happen in Palestine but rather took place in the slopes of Hijaz and Assir (in today's Saudi Arabia).His first book in which he unveiled his new theory is the Bible Came from Arabia, which appeared in the early 80s.Unlike what a reader might expect, the style of the book is attractive and contains a lot of Salibi's wit, which draws the non-historian reader away from boredom.The book is a classic. If you plan to buy it and read it, it would certainly be a good choice."
5,Great tool for every job,I have been a Gerber user for years and have found this model to be a great combination of tools. The additional toolkit has been very useful in the small amount of time I have had it. Scissors and knife work very well.
5,DEVILS RULE BABY!!!!!,I love this tape. I became a Devils fan about 2 years ago. I will continue to route for the Stanley Cup Champion Devils!!! This is a great video. If you're a hockey fan like me than this tape is for you! A NEW JERSEY DEVILS fan for Life!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"Sorry, but I cannot agree with the other reviewers. The video misses to capture the magic and thrilling moments of the series, is full of boring interviews and does not show enough ice-hockey (why not showing a few scenes in slow motion or show some goals from different angles?). This video does not live up to the great expectations you had if you followed the series. Compared to the other nhl-videos (Detroit, Dallas) it is therefore for the objective viewer (maybe not for the die-hard Devils fan) a disappointment."
4,Bead Cutting Chisels,PSI Woodworking LCBEAD4 4 Piece HSS Bead Cutting Lathe Chisel SetFun to use. I keep two in Florida and two in North Carolins. Lazy mans way to make a bead. They cut sharply so you need to sand carefully.
4,Great Westerns,This book arrived on time as described. I haven't had time to read it yet.I am looking forward to reading it & I thank you for making the purchase of so many books so easy.
1,Not worth the money - higher tech snake oil,"Doesn't work any miracles, but it provides a nice, soothing break. Allow me to save you a couple hundred dollars: learn to count your breaths--breathe in to 4-6 beats. Exhale for 10-15 seconds. Do this for 20 minutes and it can lower your blood pressure maybe 10 points (on top). But drop it below 120/80? I haven't experienced that."
5,No Doubt About It Now!,"I cannot believe this product works as well as they say it does! I noticed a difference right away. Both the top & bottom numbers have gone down back to normal (that's right, NORMAL!) in less than a month (my HBP was attributed to stress, despite the fact that I'm in terrific health). If you're willing to commit the time (approximately 12-14 minutes a night), you too will get dramatic results. My only wonder is why this product is not prescribed to every single person in America with HBP."
3,Take time and Breathe!,"I have only been using the product a short time, but I recognize the value of taking the time to relax and breathe deeply. I think the device is overpriced for what it actually does, and I have not been using it long enough to know if it really does lowers blood pressure. If you can afford, it buy it. If not, read about Yoga breathing and buy some nice New Age music and take the time to relax. You could accomplish pretty much the same thing over time."
1,Don't waste your money:(,This machine is a big waste of money! It is an interesting concept that allows some peaceful time but does NOTHING for Blood Pressure! It should be sold as a meditational aid for $25.00!!! They should be ashamed for advertising it as a medical device:( I sent it back after 6 Weeks of devoted use.............
1,Resperate Device,Expensive...and after three months of daily use I can't say it has helped my blood pressure.I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from nights sleep.I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises. Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.My blood pressure hasn't changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.The Resperate Device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule hasn't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent.I continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but wouldn't consider buying it again.
2,Don't see much benefit from this machine,"When I started using the instrument, my breathing rate turned out to be already below 10 breaths per minute. What the machine does can really be accomplished by simply concentrating on your breathing. However, I don't feel that just by slowing your breathing rate you can control your high blood pressure. If that was the case I would not have high blood pressure with my low breathing rate. Maybe someone has a breathing rate of 17 or more per minute might benefit, but I feel I wasted money on quite an expensive gadget. The only benefit that I gained from the machine was to become more aware of my breathing rate. My mistake was that I should have measured my breathing rate before ordering."
3,Almost A Detective Story,"Almost. But then Packer didn't write detective stories. Her lead character, Buzzy Cloward, returns to his hometown in New York's Finger Lakes. He's just outof prison where he was sent for the murder of Carrie Burr. He ran her downwhile he was drunk, driving her husband's car. Slater Burr has since remarried.Now questions about this murder are provoked by thoughts like ""How did Buzzylearn to drive a foreign car (Jaguar) so fast that night?"" Buzzy's returnto Cayuta, New York, starts people asking questions that perhaps Slater Burrcould do without."
3,a few good songs,"i thought he made more and better hits....anyway """"you win again """" is an all time great....."
2,"""letdown'","I rented this expecting hot guys. Well the 1st guy was young, great body, very cute, and shows everything. The DVD went down hill fast after him. The others were a joke. If they sold this DVD for under 10.00 showing just the 1st guy I would buy it."
1,How can they be so cheap?,Simple. They're fake. A simple google search reveals how to distinguish between real and fake brush heads.The product matches exactly with the description of the fake brushes.
1,Gimmick,"Love Oral B, but these seem to be more of a gimmick than anything else and my dental hygienist agrees. Even after using these heads, real flossing still picks up gunk left behind. In fact because the flossing paddles take up so much space on the head they brush less efficiently than the regular Oral B round sensitive heads. Don't throw away your floss just yet."
1,counterfeit brushes,"I ordered four 3 packs of these brushes because they were such a good deal. I received six 2 packs. We have used 6 of the brushes since September 2010 and four were defective. After only a few weeks use, the head of the brush is so loose it pinches the inside of your mouth. The one that I just started using keeps falling off the handle. And none of the brushes have the fading of the blue bristles that indicates when It's time to replace. I have never had this problem before and am convinced they're counterfeit.I've emailed this company twice and have got no response. I would strongly suggest not buying from this company, particularly not these toothbrushes."
5,worth the purchase,I chose this because of the floss action and I would reccomend this to everyone. My dentist is very pleased with my teeth.
5,Best Checkup Ever!,I am 30 yrs old and got my best checkup ever from my dentist after using these for 6 months.
3,too rough on my sensitive gums,"I started using this about a month before seeing my dentist, having switched from Sonicare because I ha dtwo of those break in three years. My dentist noticed immediatly that my gumms were irrtated and recommended that I stop using this and switch back to Sonicare, which I had used for nearly 20 years until their planned obscelence ticked me off. Any other suggestions?"
5,Best and cheapest place to buy these,"This is my third set purchased here at Amazon, because it is the (see title of review). They're OEM and not cheap imitations from Taiwan."
1,Pass!,"These did not look, feel or perform very well, bristles felt like they were fraying almost immediately, would not purchase again."
4,Great Product,I was worried by the fact I could get a fake brush head refill... fortunately I get the original refill and I'm happy for the performance of the product.
1,hard on your gums,"Be very careful, these are much harder on your gums, would not recommend, does not go between teeth."

5,Nice.,"These toothbrush heads are awesome! They are slightly larger than the ones I had before, so I imagine they have more brushing power. My mouth feels fresh and clean. :D"
2,Too rough for everyday use,"The ""floss"" in the brush is quite stiff; it doesn't seem to help flossing much, but rather makes brushing less effective. Don't like the idea of this product. Better keep flossing and brushing separate. Will buy the regular brush heads next time."
4,A very good product,Pros: I choose this product for the affordability and flexibility and comfortable to use vice flossing and it is working just fine since I do not have to floss as much I used to.Cons: Not noticed any problem so far.I would recommend this product to my friends.
1,Fell apart while brushing after few uses,"After a few uses (about 10 or so), the brush head started coming apart. First the rubber pieces on the head starting falling apart in mouth while brushing. After a few more uses the whole head feel apart as the small metal pieces came unscrewed. Same thing happened to all the 3 heads in the pack. I don't have any proof, but felt like counterfeit material."
2,Genuine but keeps falling off,"I checked and these appear to be the genuine Oral B. There may be some misleading information in the pictures. They show ""Oral B"" in Blue as the genuine ones, but mine that came with the brush have the gray ""Oral B"". These replacements also have the gray, but pass the genuine test.The problem is that this first of the 3-pack falls off the spindle during brushing. It doesn't fit tight enough. I inspected the original and this new one and they are alike, so there must be a product quality control problem, as the new one falls off quite easily. It doesn't click like the original one."
5,Best price on refill heads,"I bought these to go along with an Oral-B Precision 3000 brush so my wife could use it as well as me, and I'd have refills handy in 3 months when the original heads wore out.I wasn't sure which head came standard with the brush so picked these based on description. The floss action head is a bit larger than the standard precision clean head but I like both of them. If your mouth tends to the larger side I certainly recommend trying these replacement brush heads."
2,No,These things are too hard and make my gums and teeth sensitive. I think the wal-mart knock off brand is better in that the bristles aren't has hard.
3,No Match for Flossing,"The heads seem to work OK and are lasting pretty well, but if if you are thinking this is a replacement for real flossing, think again, unless you have big spaces between your teeth. If I use this head and then floss, it is obvious the floss was still needed. I can't tell if it is any better than the standard head."
1,got the fake ones too!,"Like many others here, I believe Amazon sent me the fake ones.At first I didn't notice much difference, but after extensive use, it didn't trigger the change-head reminder on my electric toothbrush. Then I looked at customer posted pictures and notes on genuine & fake comparison, pretty sure I received fake ones.So I contacted Amazon, was told to send them back on my expense for partial refund, I say NO! I'm keeping them and let all my friends know, I thought we deserved an apology from Amazon but apparently they don't think that way, very disappointed!"
4,pretty good,"they don't seem quite as well constructed as the original, but they work. better than paying more elsewhere...trust me I looked."
2,Battery loss,"The moment I put this head on my Braun toothbrush I had the feeling there was more drag and I expected less battery life. The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head. I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days. 3 days is the new norm. That's quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger. It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference. After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it's smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."
5,Great edge & handy companion!,"This handy pocket pal holds a sharp edge, opens easily, feels light and comfortable, and is well crafted. I've carried one for years."
4,Very light and convenient,"A good knife for everyday use. The polymer handle doesn't scratch your cell phone or wear a hole in your pocket. Good quality blade and easy to sharpen. So light, sometimes you forget you have it."
4,great little knife,i love it. super sharp and useful. only downer is it is small enough to misplace easily.
4,Good Pocket Knife,"This is a good, simple, durable, and light-weight pocket knife with a keen edge that doesn't dull quickly. Overall a great buy for the price."
1,Plastic trash,"This was an unpleasant surprise. It looks cheap and it feels cheap. The blade is coarsely ground and has a slight wobble. The rivets that hold the body together are loose and you can see daylight if you look through back edge. I was going to give it a two, but on second thought, fugeddaboudit."
5,heatwave,"excellant movie, love the 87th precinct books, so movies are even better, I wish they would made more of them"
2,"CUT VERSION , NOT FULL LENGTH","Although I found this to be a reasonably priced DVD I was disappointed to find out this IS NOT a full length uncut version of this movie. Obvious disclosure of this should be mandatory when selling a cut movie. The movie, though old, is interesting and would probably rate at least a 4 star if uncut."
4,Moving and thought-provoking,"This book finally clinched it in my mind: I like Card's writing.This collection of works (a novella and short stories) examines what is important in life, the impact our mortality has on our lives, and what it means to be human in a way that is touching and thought-provoking. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Was happy at first; now seems to interfere with Wireless LAN,"Bought this phone in July 2007 at Target - the base station + 1 additional handset. I was really delighted with it at first - I especially liked the speaker phone and mute buttons on the handset - those are hard to find. I found the talk time to be quite adequate, would use it for 8+ hours of conference calls from my home office and it would still be going strong. However, I noticed the batteries starting to lose their rechargability in the fall of 2008, and replaced the batteries on both handsets in December 2008. Since I replaced the batteries, there is terrible static on both handsets, and the talk time is now about 1.5 hours before the handset starts beeping low battery. I believe I am experiencing interference with my Wireless LAN, but the strange thing is, I didn't have this problem before replacing the batteries."
4,GE 6.0 Digital Accessory Handset,This is a very inexpensive phone that has all the options you could ever want with the ease of cordless functionality.
2,not for senior citizens,"Lots of nice features on this phone with an excellent price. But the volume is much too low, even when turned up to the max, especially for us older folks who don't hear very well. We are constantly asking our callers to speak up. We just cannot use these phones. Anyone want to buy them?"
3,good and not so good,The products I recieved promptly and had no problems with shipping. When I recieved the additional phone to go with the base one phone registered beautifully and the other did not register at all. I then sent it to the closest repair place the beginning of December and have yet to hear from them regarding replacement or repair. Needless to say on one hand I am happy that one unit worked but on the other not so happy as I have already paid for the unit that doesn't work and have no idea when I will recieve it back!!!
1,Not a drop of black ink in it!,"You cannot do any worse than this cartridge. It is three colors only; cyan, magenta, and yellow. Yes, you may say, ""mine prints in black."" However, when printing black it squirts all at once. That's why one reviews said the black looks gray.If you print text, think of this is a big ink-sucking Hummer."
3,Doesn't last long,"Amazon is great in delivering items. I have no choice but to use the Lexmark 1 cartridge because that's all the printer will take. It has a very short life and needs to be replaced often. But until I get myself a better printer, that's what I'm stuck with."
1,Poor Quality / Short life,"The cartridge will not even print black -- it is more like gray. I print just a few pages and the printer says ""low ink"" I get 50% more out of the cartridge and in two weeks, I have to buy a new cartridge. That is just printing about 15 pages a day or so. I've hated this printer since day 1 -- I wish they at least made high capacity cartridges or something!"
1,Useless,"These Coleman machetes are essentially useless. They are so lightweight and flexible, I don't know what they intended them to be used for. They will cut some weeds, but they won't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1/2 inch. I have used a few of these, as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where I live. They also rust badly.You're much better off with an Ontario Knife machete, or another better machete."
1,damaged item,Order the item based on the review. But item arrived with damage and inappropriate packaging. It is not in the original box. Someone wrapped it in two boxes with package type. No instructions like a open box item. The base is broken.Really disappointed. Waste my time and energy.
2,"Alright product, questionable packaging/distributor","The packaged arrived in poor condition, like so many other people have reported. The base of the lamp was scuffed and dirty and the plastic torn, as if it were dragged in the dirt or tossed/handled roughly. There is a big dent in the base, which is fairly impressive :POne of the plastic rings that you have to unscrew and then re-screw to attach the lamp cups was a HUGE PAIN to get off, because whoever had packaged the lamp had screwed it on so forcefully that the ring was jammed crookedly on the grooves.And finally, the bottom plate of the lamp (where it attaches to the base) is so poorly welded (or perhaps it was broken to begin with) that it snapped right off when we tried to screw the lamp to its base.you get what you pay for."
4,Good,It took over a week to arrive but it was worth the wait. No damage on ours. Lights the whole living room. Looks great behind the couch!
1,poorly packaged product = damaged lamp,"From my past experience, problems with products purchased on Amazon are usually quickly resolved. This lamp has been the exception. The lamp arrived in a cardboard box with no protection for the arms but a plastic bag. Needless to say they were damaged, badly scratched and a plastic nut used to secure the lampshade was broken and unusable. Currently I am still waiting to get this resolved but given the response so far I am losing any interest in a replacement and I feel that I will be better off if I just get my money back and go elsewhere for a lamp. The seller did not respond as expected so now we had to open a claim with Amazon to get this resolved. All this aggravation and we are still looking or a lamp. What a waste of time!"
1,ONE UGLY LIGHT,THIS IS ONE UGLY LOOKING LIGHT. EVEN STREET LIGHTS LOOK MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN THIS.DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT.
2,be forewarned,"I bought this lamp thinking each of the 5 arms were easily adjustable gooseneck material. Wrong! When bent to your personal use, the arms have a permanent bend. When fully assembled and when you've discovered its shortcomings...good luck taking it apart for return. I had to use a hammer and screwdriver to separate the 2 halves, rendering it unreturnable. Amazon might have honored a return, but I would have felt very guilty returning an item I damaged trying to return. Nevertheless, the lamp is well-made, but I can't think how anyone would use it. Maybe if the arms were gooseneck..."
2,It works but not as advertised,The box arrived completely broken open due to very poor packaging design. Nothing was damaged inside. The base weighs about 15 pounds and is in the shape of a brick with a large steel half circle support. Had to disassemble the base completely to take the plastic wrapping off. It was assembled wrapped in plastic and bolted together that way. The light bulbs are not as advertised. Small nightlight type bulbs. I do not recommend this purchase online due to the irregularities.
2,One of the least essential CDs ever,"Ok, if you want to hear Arrested Development's greatest songs, buy their first CD. It's catchy. It's fun. It's socially conscious if that's a value you seek in your rap albums, but not overly so if you don't.The rest of their work is garbage. Their acoustic CD. Junk. Their cover of Revolution - almost as bad as the original. Their followup CD - or don't make me choke on my own bile. And that Marvin Gaye song adaptation - like Wild Wild West proved, not everything goes better with rap."
1,Hated them,This was horrible.....ruined my whole dinner......smelled so bad even my son had to take them right out to trash outside.....
4,video,This was recommended to me by new parents. I sent it to my daugter and soninlaw. They love it. Compact and easy to use. I get a new video of my grandson daily. Just put it in your pocket and go. Very simple to use.
5,Litttle Wonder is truly a wonder.,the RCA Little Wonder produces great pictures for such a small camera. The movies are easily stored on i-Photo and edited wiith i-Movie. The images viewed on a lcd TV are really great. At $75 this is really a great buy!
2,Don't know what was expected of it,"I thought it to be funny and interesting but the CD content is more of a complain and regret of the people. Bought it as a present for hubby and it turned into a complain and negligence and incapabilities pointed.I will say it has nothing positive in it,so better not buy for yourself also"
4,Pretty okay pads,"Doesn't feel as strong as the oem brakes for some reason, but they're ceramic so there's very very little brake dust compared to the oem pads. Also, only two of the pads come with the clip, which is kind of weird, but installs and works just fine."
4,Pino Grande,"A well-written and photographed history of a unique logging operation in the sugar pine forests of California. The Michigan-California Lumber gained access too the rich stand of Pine timber between the North and South Forks of the American River by using a unique 2600 foot overhead cable-way system which spanned the 1600 foot deep American River Gorge. The car, suspended from cables, was capable of, and routinely carried fully-loaded log and lumber cars, and even complete steam locomotives. In its two decades of life before being lost to a fire, it carried millions of board feet of pine and fir for decades."
4,Great movie,This movie had some parts that were unexpected that kept your attention like the hammer scene. This movie is a must see i even thought of some changes in my life i could make.
5,Just what I ordered!,I was so happy to find that this video was available at Amazon on DVD. It is an excellent movie that I use in my 6th grade science classes before they move on to junior high. It is SO inspirational. I appreciated Amazon's prompt delivery.
3,Shrinks,"Shrunk terribly after one washing. Don't put this one in the dryer! Better yet, order a larger size."
4,Great read,"I'm about halfway through the book and find it very insightful. The analogies Dr. Wilson presents are so powerful. They really helped me understand the emotional side of my life and to understand why life events can be hurtful. It is helping me to see the ""why"" behind the ""what"" of my life. I encourage anyone who is struggling to find healing for painful events in their life to read this book."
5,A good watch,"No, this is definitely not ""Barney Miller""! If you are looking for a dark-ish gutsy police crime drama with plenty of action, this one is for you."
4,"A Great Book, but confusingly titled","This is the same book released under the title ""The Truelove"" in the US. ""Clarissa Oakes"" is the title used for the British release."
3,Everlast-for a while,I purchased this item a while ago. The sand will sink to the bottom. I raised the bag higher so I will still get in a good workout without hitting soft bag. I recommend spending more money and getting more bang for your buck. I rated this three stars because it was so inexpensive. It has held up to the workout I have put in on it.
3,Check the Date!,"This book seems up-to-date until you see the original print date. It hasn't been updated much since the '70s, and although some procedures haven't changed (e.g, fixing an electrical connection) that much, others have (eg, electronics equipment)."
1,Don't buy it,"I bought a Dynex external kit out of necessity late one night. It worked once, thats right, once. The next time I hooked it up the HD wouldn't spin up. The power supply it came with had lost the 12 volt output, as it turn s out its more expensive to replace the power supply than to just buy a whole new set up. I've since replaced it."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Unit does have a great enclosure for durability. No Heat dissipation though. It fried the PCB on a 120 GB drive of mine. Replaced that one with a 300 GB Seagate Barracuda and it worked for about a month. (No need to set the dive to Master, Cable select works just fine.) Then the power cable lost a contact. I had to take the unit apart and twist the cable the right way to make contact as I couldn't get to the connection with a soldering Iron to fix. Bad design on the power supply connection to the board. If you do buy it, keep it flat and have no tension on the power cable or you will be replacing it sooner rather than later."
1,broke,the part of the earring that goes thru the ear broke off after only 2 days. i loved the earring before that.
3,review,"item is good, but i thought i'd be able to plug this in from my laptop to tv with the vga cord and watch and hear the movie over the tv. i had to plug this cord into my stereo to hear sound."
5,iPod Touch to car stereo,"I got this wire to connect my iPod Touch to the input jacks in my 2005 Honda Odyssey. The jacks were next to the 3rd row seats ( for the kid's video games, I guess), but I connected this 12-foot wire and ran it under the seats and floor mats to the front so I could listen to my iPod. Works great."
4,Belkin audio cable,"This is not the one that I was intent to get for my macbook. But it turned out that this is not a fit for my mac and HDTV. So for those who are going to buy it please ready the TV manual first. But I plug it into my Bose speaker which brings a fairly short (<5in) audio cable, and it works just fine. But the material looks really cheap. You get what you pay for, plus a free two day shipping. It's well worth the money!"
4,Not for HDTV audio,"I buy this one to hear my Pc on Tv, I have a Lg HDTV and the audio work on AV2 not on RGB-PC, on the side of the connection for the VGA cable is a connection for the pc audio and you need the audio cable with the same both plugs, like the one you connect on your PC for audio not the red and white."
5,Works great for RCA connectors,I use this for the audio hookup from my laptop to my television. The cables are tangle-free and the sound is very good. Everything I expected.
1,Do not Buy it,"As I understood that this cable can be used to connect PC (Labtop) to TV. However, It did not work for me. No Audio."
3,Cheap. You get what you pay for.,"You really can't beat the price of this product. There are soft drinks more expensive than this! That being said, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a temporary or short-term solution, I definitely recommend this product. As far as life expectancy goes you can expect anywhere from 1yr to 1.5 yrs.Pros: Super cheap.Cons: Slightly diminished quality of sound (but it's composite anyway so it doesn't really matter).Short product life."
1,not recommended unless you just like to spend money,"I got my toolset today. It is a cheap knockoff of the gerber and wenger swiss army knife. Not all tools work. The can opener on the pliers is too short so the angle doesn't work and the one on the swiss army knife is so dull it hardly digs into the can. The file made as if someone just scribbled a bunch of scratches on a piece of metal. The fish scaler on both tools is too thick to dig into the scale. The leather hole puncher is not sharp. I can tell you what works: pliers, bottle opener, scissors, knife, screwdriver, corkscrew, and wood saw. Assume the rest is unusable. If you are buying this set especially to use those tools, I recommend getting a genuine article. If you just like buying things, then these can be had for cheap."
2,Received used pieces.,"I've read reviews about people getting used set but anyway I wanted to try my luck. And it turned out my luck was bad. I bought this set and get the Sheffield WH58003 2 Piece Antique Tool Set as a gift set. Out of the 5 pieces, 3 were obviously used. And the other two also have scratches on the medal but I'm not sure if they are used or new."
3,"OK....not bad for factory ""seconds"".","This tool and knife set is heavy weight and can be functional. However, the brass was scratched and second rate which lead me to believe tha the set were factory ""seconds""."
5,Beautiful Set,"The tools I received were brand-new and in mint condition. They are quality tools, and the wood and brass handles set them apart."
5,Love this dress!,"This dress is so pretty. When it first came it was a bit too tight, but the sizing is correct. I was just in the process of dropping some pounds. Now it fits really well. The slit in the front makes it more interesting than just a plain, linen dress."
1,Waste of money-dried out-won't replace,"I purchased a two-pack of Stanley FatMax xtreme Chisel Tip Markers model 47-314 at a Lowe's store recently. This was the last pack and was discounted due to it being a clearance item. When I got home and opened the sealed package and tried to use the markers, they were both completely dried up. I called the Stanley company and was told they could not send me any replacements, because ""they come from a distribution center in Connecticut."" I was told to return them to the store.(contrary to the website warranty instructions) Unless I find the receipt, which is doubtful, I'm out the cost of these. The markers look 'heavy duty', but are useless unless they contain ink."
2,If only I'd saved my money ...,"I don't normally read straightforward romance novels but I was in a hurry to catch a plane and it looked kind of interesting ... The blurb ""Love Story for the Nineties"" should have warned me off, but having read the book I realise that this was a compliment to it - in fact it doesn't even reach this level. This portrayal of two young people in love never rises above a Hollywood-type fantasy where two beautiful perfect people share a series of corny romantic moments - including (so help me God) making love on a beach - you can fill the rest in yourself from any stock romantic comedy. There isn't a single character in this book who isn't a cliche and I found it impossible to feel any sorrow when tragedy strikes these cardboard people. This saccharine romantic fantasy trivialises the reality of HIV infection and never rises above a sentimentalised cliche. Not very impressive"
5,A CRACK IN FOREVER,I have read this book in 2000 and i got hooked unable to put the book down and i finished it within a day. I cried so much while reading and also read again 3 times. i passed the book around to my friends and they too liked it. i should have put up review long ago but just can't remember the title of it.i would read it again and again
4,GE RO filter,Very fast shipping. Great product. However not sure if buying on-line is the cheapest. Do your research and shop around.
5,Safe and easy to use,"This product is very nice, the handle is great size so your hand don't slip easily. It is safe to use around the kitchen."
5,Great carry knife,"I have owned several pocket clip knives over the past 40 years. Puma, Shrade, and Buck to name just three. This Gerber E-Z Out Skeleton is the absolute best knife I've ever owned. I have owned the serrated edge that I carry clipped to my pocket for about 3 years and just ordered the non serrated blade for my backpack. These knives are very easy to maintain a razor edge own and they seem to keep that edge twice as long as other knives I've owned. They carry very well clipped to my pocket and they are so light and THIN you cannot tell it's there. This knive is very well made and the blade is tough as any knife I've owned. I'd HIGHLY recommend either knive, serrated or non-serrated, to everyone."
4,Any true Slayer fan should like this,"In case you didn't know this is a tribute to the allmighty SLAYER. Many underground death/black/doom metal acts attempt to recreate the unholy wrath of Slayer's classics in this compilation. Some do better than others while nothing is quite like the original(s). None the less it is refreshing to here these different takes on these classic melodies.Of course, Hanneman and Kings guitar works are not rivaled, particually on ANGEL OF DEATH and SEASONS IN THE ABYSS, but who in the hell could?! Some other songs like DIE BY THE SWORD, HELL AWAITS and READ BETWEEN THE LIES are given a good run for thier money.Any true SLAYER fanatic should check this CD out. Pretty damn good."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I purchased a director's chair. I was very surprised to receive the product and discover that there were no covers. I looked back at Amazon to see if it was my error but I don't think it was. No where is there an indication that I was purchasing just the frame and that covers are sold separately. When I called customer support at Homevisions they had no excuse for the error. In fact, they didn't seem to know anything about how the product was advertised on Amazon. I now have to purchase covers. I will not do business with this company again."
3,Disco Queens Unite!,"I find this video to be very entertaining, but I have to admit that personally it is really hard to follow the choreagraphy. Richard Simmons does a pretty good job calling the steps but the camera angles flying all over the place are dizzying. I'm not good at dancing - frankly, I'm horrible at it - so not being able to concentrate on the trainer from one direction makes this work out a bit frustrating. I've watched it, tried to follow it many times, and still can't get it right. Sad! None the less, its still pretty fun even if you wind up marching around instead of doing the steps."
2,Healthy should not be this difficult,"I ordered this cookbook based on the reviews and have also done research on what macrobiotics is. Turns out I already knew what it was, had tried eathing that way only to quit because eating healthy is too expensive. I took a websites advice and ordered several different cookbooks so I could get new ideas. The majority of ingredients listed in this book are hard to find. The closest whole foods store to me is over 50 miles away. For example - a lasagna recipe called for mochi,tofu,and umeboshi plums. Come on, seriously? I am Italian and know how to make a healthy lasagna without those ingredients and ingredients that are easy to find. I will give her credit for one thing, she tells you in the back of the book exactly what everything ingredient is. Other than that, being healthy and eating healthy shouldnt be this difficult."
3,It looks nice...at first.,"This MP3 player is quite neat and useful...but that only lasted for a month or 2 because it scratches way too easy. The interface is great and the sound is awesome. It does get slugish if too many songs are in its memory. All in all, mine worked for about 9 months before it decided to stop working. I sent it in to RCA 2 months ago and still am waiting for some type of response from them. So if you are looking for an MP3 player that will stay looking nice and have a long lifespan....then this one is not it (especially at over $100)."
3,What a story,"To hear this woman's life was incredible, and it truly shows the strength and courage by writing her story down."
3,Packaging Could be BETTER!,"I love the Mission Impossible series older and newer versions. I was excited to complete my collection of the series. However, this is a review on a return and replace item. The first set of dvds I received the container for the dvds was crushed. This allowed the dvds to move around during shipment. I sent that set back and was sent a replacement set. Wouldn't you know it...the same thing. It occurs to me the packaging is just gonna suck no matter how many times I return and replace. Packaging construction is shoddy. Other than that no issues."
4,Works Fine for Me,My 12 cup glass carafe identical version works fine. The quality of the brewed coffee is fine. Like my last Krups Coffee Maker it will leave a dime sized dribble of coffee when you pull out the carafe while it is filling it. The comparable Braun unit is more aesthetic however it does not have a timer. The unit is large. I prefer the 10 cup coffee makers because they use less space.
2,not good,"this product is not worth its high cost. The bubbles in the water gauge is a hassle--I have to ""burp"" it with almost every pot. The spring on the filter basket spout broke almost immediately. I also have to agree that the coffee is not very hot. I have used this for 18 months or so. This product needs work."
3,Good but not perfect,"I bought this coffee maker to replace a Zojirushi Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker, not because it didn't make good coffee, but because it was inconvenient to use. This new Krups solved all those problems, but adds two new ones. The coffee doesn't stay hot nearly as long as the Zojirushi, and you must turn the carafe upside down to get out the last cup of coffee. I haven't noticed the complaints listed by others about a plastic taste or poor tasting coffee. Mine tastes just fine."
2,a disappointment,"We have used Krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them. This coffee maker has two problems. (1) Its spout is badly engineered. It is impossible to pour out the last 3/4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid. (2) It is a thermos; so the machine does not heat up the coffee, but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed. I like hot coffee. After the first cup, I find that I have to heat up the remainder in the microwave. This is inconvenient. I would not buy another of this model."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I received this coffee maker for Christmas 2009. It died on me yesterday. I loved this coffee maker until it failed. The display no longer lights up and no activity. In fairness to the product, my wife and I make 6-8 cups of coffee a day, sometimes twice a day. It did get a lot of use.The coffee in the thermal carafe is not extremely hot like some might like, but it stays luke warm for several hours. It also has a setting for small runs that seemed to make it hotter for 2-3 cups. The filters worked reasonably well in the unit."
3,OK but some things could be better,"This is a nice well constructed Coffee maker. We decided on it because we thought the thermos would keep the coffee hot, but it is not hot enough to stay hot long in a cup and the pot is heavy and has a flat bottom so for the last cup you need to turn the pot upside down to get the coffee. Some people in our house can't do that."
1,You'll be sorry,"Saw this at the hardware store, Made in Mexico. Bought one at BBB, didn't look (didn't think I had to), it was made in China. AWFUL COFFEE, tasted like plastic and chemicals. Controls are confusing, returned it. Went back to the hardware store and bought the one made in Mexico. It wouldn't even hold water, it ran all over the counter from underneath."
2,"Design of the controls is unintuitive, confusing, poor","The best one can say about this Krups is that it makes coffee. Whether the coffee is ""worse"" or ""better"" than other brands probably depends more on the coffee than on the coffee making machine. For anyone accustomed to, or a fan of, good user-griendly modern design this Krups is poor. As the Krups' designersmoved from the good old ""analog"", i.e. physical, controls, to ""software"" controls (i.e. "" first push button A then button B for 3 seconds, etc."", thethe usability plummeted. It's ridiculous that the customer has to continually go back and consult the (good old analog) paper manual to remind ones selfwhat buttons to press when. Finally, there is nothing graceful about the object itself; It is a big, chunky, squarey, black-and-stainless steel, lump.I am comparing it to the previous graceful Krups slim, curvy, graceful, mostly white designs."
4,Superior German Manufacture,"I was a little nervous with the bad reviews on here on this item, but this has been a fantastic coffee maker! I have owned a Krups Expresso maker for over 12 years with heavy use and it works everytime, and that is what made me want to get another Krups product. I have had no plastic taste (the built in water filter is great!), no water spilling out, no bubbles in the measure tube, no steamed over digital readout. No problem getting the coffee out of the caraffe. The only thing I dont like is the blue LED turns off after about 15 min, it would be nice if it stayed on all the time. After going to Kohls and looking at the coffee maker with the glass caraffe, I chose this one (the glass just seems so thin and fragile) 2 thumbs up!"
3,What a pain to clean the carafe,"The Krups FMF-5 makes decent coffee, but the stainless steel carafe is very difficult to keep clean. So far filling it with vinegar and then scrubbing the inside with a Dobie pad is the only way I've found to remove most of the coffee stains. Also, the programmable timer clock loses time--about five minutes a week. The only way to reset it is to unplug the unit; then, plug it back in after waiting for at least two minutes."
2,Disappointed in Krups current quality,Purchased the KRUPS FMF54 as a replacement for an identical product that I had purchased several years ago. The quality of this product was very disappointing to the previous one. The basket does not close without extreme effort. The timer must be set every day instead of remaining in memory. The Carafe lid does not fit well.
3,Design flaws,"This machine makes perfectly serviceable drip coffee and has the standard stainless steel appearance. As the person who makes the coffee in our house I find it has 2 annoying flaws.First, the water holder is rather narrow (a flat oval, rather than more round), so if you're not paying careful attention and pouring slowly, water drips on the counter when you're filling it. Second, it's hard to read how many cups of water are in there without my glasses. On our previous machine, it was clearly visible without my glasses. Having to hunt around for my reading glasses in order to make a pot of coffee may seem a minor annoyance, but it's an annoyance nonetheless."
2,"I equated ""Krups"" with ""quality""...","I purchased this coffee maker for the following reasons: 1. 10-cup thermal carafe, 2. Cool stainless steel look, 3. Krups name. Three weeks later, I returned it for the following reasons: 1. Weird taste, 2. Difficulty pouring, 3. Much-less-than-10-cup carafe. It was my first--and possibly only--foray into the Krups coffee maker domain."
2,several flaws,"I have a white Krups with a glass carafe that is not programmable..just a coffee maker and it makes great coffee with no problems. I bought this one because I wanted a stainless steel one to match my appliances. Well, I got my old Krups back out after using this one. First of all, the water gauge on the side does not work so you don't know how much coffee it will make. I took a measuring cup and poured in 6 cups of water and when it brewed, it overflowed. I thought this was a 10 cup coffee maker unless they mean the teeny expresso cups! It doesn't keep the coffee hot enough either. The carafe is hard to pour and sometimes it comes out all over the place! I can't get it to program for 1-3 cups. Sometimes the latch to open it up to get to the coffee filter will not unlatch. It's just a poorly design coffee maker!"
1,Drives me crazy,"When everything works well, it actually makes good coffee. Now what doesn't work: There is a tube on the left side that shows how much water you have poured into the machine. This will typically get air-bubbles in it make it worthless. Next it beeps at you for all sorts of things. Yes the beeper can be shut off, unfortunately it can take several frustrating minutes to do this simple procedure. The thermal carafe does not do a very good job of keeping coffee warm. The biggest problem has been with the door that hods the coffee filter. There is a spring that holds the door open when the latch is released, this spring occasionally pops out and it is extremely difficult to put back. And finally the latch that holds said door shut will pop open during brewing. You can guess where the scalding water goes. Lot's of nice ideas that just don't work."
2,Nice But Fragile,"This maker has a nice quick brewing time and overall good coffee but there are other problems. The swing out basket snapped off on mine and now occasionally flings the hot ground out onto the floor while brewing. The spring also is broken due to a poor design. The coffee also stay ""hot"" for only an hour before it needs to be microwaved. Not for a person who makes coffee every day."
5,Couldn't be better...,"This coffee maker is the best--perfectly brewed coffee every time with a carafe that keeps the coffee hot forever. The automatic turn off means you don't have to worry about a thing. I wouldn't own another, in fact I own two of these."
4,Generally pleased,"In general I am pleased with the quality of this product. It makes tasty hot coffee that stays hot for hours in the carafe. My only complaint is small; air bubbles get in the filler tube on the side so it is guess work determining how much water you have added to the reservoir. I tried removing the end plug like one reviewer suggested but it did not help at all. Much cheaper than the Technivorum coffee maker, probably the benchmark for drip coffee makers."
1,Krups coffee maker,"This machine lives up to the poor reviews we read before purchasing it! We were looking for a replacement for our old Krups coffee maker and learned that it was no longer available, and this model replaced it. The reviews we read were iffy at best, but we bought it anyway, trusting the Krups name. The carafe leaks all over when you try to pour it. The water level column is prone to developing air bubbles, so it's impossible to judge how many cups are being poured into the chamber. Krups Customer Service was not helpful at all, so we were stuck with a crummy product. It's put away in a closet and we are still using the OLD coffee maker instead! Don't buy this product."
3,"Decent coffee, good thermos","My husband and I enjoy the quality of the coffee, programmable features and thermos, which keeps coffee hot for an hour and warm for about 2. I agree with the other reviewers that the pour spout design on the carafe causes water or coffee to spill if you're not extremely careful, and the water holder on the machine is impractical, as it is hard to pour water into it without spilling. These things are mild annoyances which we generally ignore. At one point I poured water into the machine, accidentally spilling some around the pot, which is easy to do given the awkward design of the water holder. I did not notice/wipe it up right away, and the water under the machine caused the coffeemaker to short circuit for 2-3 days. I was about to toss it out and buy a new one, when it dried itself out and came back to life. Over all a good, but not great, coffee maker."
1,Junk - Keeps overheating and breaking,"I just threw mine away. We were having the issue where the coffee maker would not start and would display the ""Water Tank Empty"" error. This error is caused by the thermal fuses tripping in the coffee maker (bottom of coffee maker, under the white plastic tubing - make sure you use the same/right temperature thermal fuse). I replaced the fuses two seperate times, each time the coffee maker would run a time or two and then break again. The last time I replace the fuses the maker clearly got over heated and made a burnt plastic smell.This maker is cleary not safe so time to get a new one. I am really dissapointed that this only lasted us a year or so of infrequent use (only 1-2x per week)Also, the other reviews about poor door design, and water level indicator issues are accurate."
4,This was our first thermal karafe coffe maker.,"I was a bit worried about the coffe being hot enough given some of the reviews I read. The morning I made the first pot, it came out a little better then luke warm. I went back and read the directions carefully and it suggested that I pre-warm the carafe. Like I want to do that every morning! Instead, I tried using a different pot to fill the maker and left the carafe at room temperature. This did the trick! I really like this maker now. I find that if I set it up the night before, letting the carafe warm back up to room temperature works great. It brews quickly and the thermal carafe really does keep the coffe tasting great much longer. The only thing I do not like about this is the fact that they have a warming plate under the carafe. This make no sense except for the fact that they probably use the same maker for the thermal and the glass carafe version."
2,Lasts about a year...2nd one to fail,Makes excellent coffee. Hard to pour in water without spilling. This is the second one I've had fail because the low water indicator will not allow the unit to turn on. Will not reset.
1,Problem,"Regretfully, this is the wrong item. I ordered the English translation of the above work. However, the bookstore sent me the Hebrew edition, which I already have. I fear that this could have been Amazon's fault. I searched for the item using the ISBN, which should have give me the Brill edition in English. But Amazon referred me to a bookstore that only have the Hebrew edition: and thus, Amazon's database referred me solely by the English title of the book (giving me the Hebrew edition), and not by the ISBN, which would specifically have given me the English edition.For me, that was a very expensive error on the part of Amazon. I still need the English book, too, but now, I don't have the money."
2,Wouldn't fit on 92 DA WITH ABS,Wouldn't fit on 92 DA WITH ABS as others have said it would. Backets looked really cheap. I ended up getting a moroso strut bar off ebay that fit with my ABS reservoir.
1,Rapid Reading? More like Skimming. SAVE your money!,speeding reading faster will not make you a better reader. It's a waste of time. Be careful and read the other reviewsand be aware of those 5 star ratings that don't have a name.
4,Solid and simple,"Love it, solid and simple. Dosent shut off via timer. The temp sensors dont seem 100% accurate but it works good enough! We bought two of them."
1,It came used and broken,"The heater was bought new, it came used and broken. The cord was loosely wrapped not from the factory. Heater also came with human hair on the bottom of the unit, looks like it was used in a bathroom. Had a screw missing from inside the grill and it rattles. I'm one mad customer at Amazon.Larry Bailey"
5,Kristin's Incredibles review,"After fifteen years giving up his career,Mr. Incredible as a crime fighter in the future.He faces the challenge of his life. So he desited to do hero work on the side. He finaly reaializes that he has fallen into a trap of a new super villen. Mr. Incredible's super family realizes that he is in truble so they deside to go find him. While they were out suerching he was fighting a robot. Since he beat the robot they became super hero's agen. That's when the Incredibles learned that working together is most important."
3,Burning all but up the charts!,"This was originally released in 1981 on Charisma Records (don't know if it got a US release then; ""1984"" didn't; mine are UK LPs). Later reissued by Varèse Sarabande with a different cover. Mostly instrumental with film dialogue. This movie had elaborate prosthetic makeup, I've heard. Recorded in Douglaston, Queens for tax purposes. Rick didn't think this would be successful, so he opted out of a cut of the film profits. It was big in Japan, and helped establish Miramax, so he may have regretted that! I don't listen to instrumental albums much. Rick even said this is more for collectors."
2,Not quite good enough-,"We bought this vacuum because we have dogs and cats and were looking for a vacuum cleaner to really get the floors clean. Early on we had a repair issue which the company did handle. The main problem is that one of our dogs is a Collie and the hair wraps around the brush and we have to spend A LOT of time cleaning the brush. Second, the vacuum really doesn't get my area rugs clean. I go over and over the rugs and still have to get down and manually brush up some of the pet hair. Nice concept but it just doesn't quite do the job. And it's performance doesn't justify the price, in my opinion."
2,Not as inclusive as the title might indicate,"Looking for an overview of the history, cultures, ethnic groups, etc, circling the Mediterranean in ancient times, I found too much emphasis on the religious traditions of those regions over the ages. It would have been helpful if that had been made clear in the title."
2,Only lasted 18 months,"Nice toaster - but only lasted 18 months. Toast will only stay down if you hold the plastic lever down. Pops up when you let go. Other than that, the size and warmer are great."
2,"Four Slices, but Only Two Coils","Unfortunately I had the exact same problem that so many have reported here: after 3 months, the center coils stopped working. Called Haier who offered exchange under warranty. However I had to pay $14.99 for the exchange, which hardly seems fair given that this is obviously a manufacturing/design defect (look how often it apparently happens).You should also note that the Haier America website no longer lists toasters under small appliances -- apparently they've decided to get out of the business. I'd recommend looking to other brands.On the positive side, it looks pretty and when it worked, it worked well. Especially liked the blue display lights which ticked off a ""countdown"" to toast."
3,Haier 4 slice toaster,"This is the 3rd toaster we have recently tried.We were having trouble finding a toaster that would evenly toast on both sides. We missed having a toaster that you could toast long slices of bread in so gave this one a try. It is certainly not perfect, but compared to the other toasters it does a fair job at toasting both sides of the bread. The pros are that the unit is clean looking, can toast two long slices of bread or 4 slices of normal bread slices. The con is that it isn't the fastest at completing the task."
4,Nice toaster,"It is large, easy to use,does perfect toasting, quality not known (I have had it only for a few weeks). Price was reasonable. I like the heating feature of the toaster. That is my story and good luck."
5,Haier Stanless steel long slot 4 slice digital toaster,"Had been looking a long time for a 4 slice long toaster. Really like this toaster. It's the best thing since ""baked bread"" (sorry for the pun). But I really do like this toaster, it looks good works great, easy to clean, what more can I say. I would give it 5 stars."
1,Don't buy it,"Bought this in Dec...it never toasted well and finally died by Sept. Been given the stall for the return of a replacement...I was told to phone back every week to see if it arrived from ""China"". Finally after I asked to speak with the Supervisor, they told me that they couldn't guarantee if they even are still making this model. I asked for my $ back and they agreed but they told me the check would be in my hands in 3 weeks. Today three weeks later, I phoned to see where my check is....they now tell me in 6 weeks.It is not just that it is a piece of junk but the company is obviously unethical and I plan to phone them daily, write a bad review on every site I can find them on, put it on my Twitter and Facebook since that is my only recourse. Would NEVER recommend them to you. Sorry for my rant."
3,"A toaster that does its job, but can be better.","I never realized that buying a toaster would be so hard. I started with a purchase of cuisinart classic toaster. Unfortunately its look did not match its performance as it toasted only on one side. I then settled on this Haier model. The good thing about this toaster is that it toasts on both sides, but I am not too thrilled. The toasting is of uneven quality. It leaves the edges untoasted or burns them."
1,Garbage,"The first one of these worked for about a week and then then center elements stopped working. Amazon paid for shipping back and quickly sent me another one. Incredibly, the replacement toaster was defective as well. Same problem, right out of the box, the center elements did not work. Amazon again paid for shipping back and I await my refund. I would not suggest buying anything made by this company. Amazon, so far has been great. However they should not offer this product for sale."
3,Nice while it lasted!,I bought this toaster from Amazon 18 months ago and whilst it was working I was very happy with it. It toasted evenly and the long slots alow you to toast bread sticks and ciabatta bread. Unfortunately it just stopped working last week for no apparent reason. I have had toasters in the past that have lasted years so 18 months just doesn't seem long enough.
1,Broke after 3 months,"This toaster seemed to work brilliantly at first. I liked the stainless steel and long slots. Then, three months after purchasing it stopped working. The toaster handle wouldn't press down thus it wouldn't toast :( I called Haier customer service and they said they'd send me a new one . . . a month later I still have no toaster and they are supposedly issuing me a refund (I'll believe it when it gets here). Really poor customer service (I had to call 3 times in order to find out that I wasn't going to get a toaster back). I will not be purchasing a Haier product again, it was a headache dealing with them."
3,looks nice... makes toast,If four slices of toast is all that you need this toaster is fine. If multiple batches are required problems arise. We can only toast two batches before the toaster starts to burn things. On the lightest setting a third batch will turn out O.K. after that the toaster needs time to cool completely. One of the reasons we bought this style of four slice toaster was the capacity for oversized slices (I love bread from the bakery) of which only two slices can be toasted at a time... we are a family of six... this toaster just barely meets our needs. It is an attractive design and may be perfect for a smaller household.
2,Doesn't last long,This is a great toaster. I like that when the toast pops up you can lift the handle which raises the toast just a little higher making it easier to remove the pieces.Update: the toaster only worked two years. At first the lever wouldn't hold down then it stopped turning on completely. Disappointing for an expensive toaster
1,Was toast after 6 months!!! It is a joke of a toaster.,"I have changed toasters before after years of use just because I wanted something new. This toaster pushed me into something new but I prefer to make my own decisions...In short, piece of junk."
1,Been two weeks,"Well, its been two weeks and still no shipment or tracking number. I agree with the other guy. DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH NUTRICITY."
3,Plenty of Action,This is an enjoyable time waster. Nice to see Mel Gibson trying to get past his troubles. Lacked the gratuitous nudity you expect from an R-rated movie but that is a small quibble.
4,Brainless fun.,"If you like action films, really don't want to think too hard and actually care for some of the characters, this film of Mel Gibson's is a lot better than the critics made it out to be.No, there is no deep message. No it doesn't tug on the heartstrings (unless you're really gullible). Yes, you can answer the phone and take a short phone call and really kind of figure out where you were/are. So, not a deep film, but a fun film with a very interesting concept of where it takes place.Just a fun film to watch on an evening when you really don't have anything else to do, had a tough day at work and just want some mindless entertainment with lots of action.Highly underrated film."
3,Mel being Mel.,"If you like Mel Gibson you should like this. I had never heard of ""Get the Gringo"". But being a fan of Mel Gibson I felt like I should see it.Enough action and suspense. A slightly different storyline. Criminal does crime. Goes to prison. Typical prison stay. Then gets out of prison and gets women and lives happily ever after. With the loot that got him in prison."
3,Mel Gibson is still good,"This is Mel Gibson being Mel Gibson. It's up to you to decide whether to believe this is an unofficial prequel to PAYBACK. It certainly has the same feel, bad guys are bad, some badder than others. In this case, he winds up in a Mexican prison that is more a city with the warden being the mayor and alot of enforcers doing whatever they want to whomever they want whenever they want. No one is safe in there but to be fair, there are no real innocents either, even the children are hardcases through no fault of their own. Betrayed once again by his supposed friends, Mel does what Mel does best..gets to know what is going on and uses it to his advantange. And as in PAYBACK he gets even. Not the greatest Mel Gibson movie but certainly not one of the worst."
4,Really liked this.,"I have enjoyed most, but not all, of Gibson's movies. This one was surprisingly good with a bit of humor here and there. Plot was believable and acting was good. Gave me the shivers as we have lived close to the border and have had numerous opportunities to travel into Mexico."
1,Don't Get The Gringo,"Waste of time and money. Mel must really need money after his troubles and divorce if this is what he is reduced to. I did not expect such a bad, bad movie! I only gave it 1 star because I had to for the review. In reality, it's a negitive 5!"
3,Get the Gringo,"The trailer was good, but the video was not what I expected, although I think Mel Gibson has made some good movies."
4,Want to see it again,"If I could believe that any prison could be that corrupt, this would be 5 stars!There is action, and strong diabolical planning in this movie, worth watching again."
5,Mexican Guy Ritchie meets Midnight Express,"A gritty action packed crime caper with several plot twists along the way. Sort of like a Mexican Guy Ritchie flick with some vintage Sam Peckinpah spaghetti western style action mixed in for good measure. If you are a Tarantino or Coen brothers fan (think ""No Country for Old Men"") or happen to like prison break tales like ""Midnight Express"" then this film is for you!"
4,Quirky Fun,Mel is back in Payback fashion in this quirky and fun movie. I find these action packed good bad guy movies highly entertaining. Recommended.
3,It's what you would expect,"Nothing to rave about here. It's quite simply a Mel Gibson action/revenge flick. Gibson's character is reminiscent of his remake of Point Blank (60's Lee Marvin movie). He's a likable, irascible sorta-bad person protagonist who rises to the occasion. The movie is enjoyable, of an appropriate length, and has a happy ending (for some of the characters, the ones you will end up liking). Nice way to pass an evening."
1,buyer's remorse,I purchased the video while out of town for a conference and assumed that the video would remain available until viewed. I learned a $4 lesson the hard way. The Internet at my hotel wasn't reliable so I had to wait a day and a half to watch it at home. It had expired.
4,entertaing!,"I am not much of a Mel Gibson fan but, this was actually really action packed and a funny, quirky movie to watch. I enjoyed it and did not look at my watch once during the movie.."
3,Works but smells,"After reading all the reviews, I decided the try the Indus for myself. As expected it keeps my feet warm and toasty, but it does smell of hot rubber. I've had mine for a few weeks now and I use it everyday. The smell doesn't bother me too much, but boyfriend finds it toxic. I think it comes down to if you can stand the smell or not."
4,Cozy feet!,If your the type of person who has poor circulation or always cold feet then here's your solution. I use this beneath my desk and am very pleased with it's performance. Takes the chill away!
3,"It works, but it stinks","That's the whole thing.. I have a basement office and it does cut the chill, but it also cuts the rubber cheese so bad that my wife won't let me use it.... she says the smell ruins dinner served in the dining room (over my office)... ahh it does stink."
4,Don't fear the smell,"Add me to the list of those who've purchased and used this product recently without encountering any odor problems. It works well and is a bargain if, like me, you sometimes have a problem with your feet getting too cold. The one minor complaint I have is that the side of the mat that's closer to where the power cord is attached gets noticeably warmer than the opposite side.Regarding purchasing the on / off switch, that probably depends on how you use it. When I keep my shoes on then this mat definitely isn't too hot -- in fact, I could stand for it to be a little warmer. With bare feet or only socks, though, it's definitely hot enough to become uncomfortable. So if you plan to use it with your shoes on then you probably don't need a ""low"" setting, though you may find it handy just to keep from having to unplug it when it's not in use.The bottom line is that this product works well and the comfort it provides is well worth the money."
2,Good lord - the smell!!!,"Have you ever seen that Seinfeld where Jerry's car is attacked by BO that doesn't go away, and lingers on anything that crosses its path? This has the same disease. Plus, it was clearly a used item - the packaging was repacked and the foot warmer was dirty. Gross, but it's a foot warmer so I thought I'd give it a chance regardless. In its defense, it *does* work - my terminally cold wife liked the warm footsy feel; unfortunately she has a sense of smell. The room we had it in is still stinky! Get this thing outta our house!!! :)"
4,Great Heater!,"I ordered this foot warmer because my office is usally about 68 degrees or so. Everyone else seems to be comfortable at that temperature but I'm freezing. I had a space heater but that was taken away because I was told it is against policy to have one. So in an effort to keep from getting frost bite at work, I ordered this foot warmer. There is a slight rubber smell when it is on, but it's nothing like some of the reviews I have read. It doesn't smell like a skunk or burn my nose or eyes. The odor is very slight and since it's under my desk, it doesn't seem to bother anyone else around me. I love this heater!! Maybe if your nose is really sensitive, you would be bothered by it, but I'm just happy to not have to sit indian style in my chair all day."
1,did I purchase a skunk?,"I never recommend this item. Go get a skunk, at least it is free. I washed, wiped off, sprayed. Nothing changed, it smells like what I said."
4,"Warm Feet, Warm Heart","It's hard to be cold when your feet are toasty warm. This mat lacks an on off switch, so you have to plug it in/unplug it to turn it on or off. Other than that, it's fantastic. It's even large enough for my feet and the cat simultaneously, which is good as we'd be fighting over it otherwise."
5,Cozy!,"Lives up to all its claims. A great value for the price. Time will tell how well-built it is, but for now it performs fine. (The cat seems to like it!)"
1,dangerous,"This worked fine for a couple of days. Then, terrible smell. It burned the floor, and melted a pair of sneakers, costing me hundreds of dollars."
1,THE SMELL!!!!!,"This will definately warm your feet and if it weren't for the smell I would recommend it, but good lord! the smell! I'm not overreacting. This thing really smells. Kind of like a skunk. I would definately not buy this, but look for a non-rubber alternative. I've had mine for a few years and thought maybe it's not that bad I'll give it another try. So I fished it out of the back of the closet, BIG MISTAKE. This smells as bad as Day 1. I'm throwing it out today."
5,addictive,"I'm confused by the reviewers who say this is just a cheap ripoff of a Soft Cell song, 'Tainted Love'. Sure it uses the same electro-funkiness effect but it doesn't sound at all like that old 80's song. They make me wonder if we're even reviewing the same song here. This new 'S.O.S.' song is simply addictive... it gets in your bones and you find yourself pulsing to the intense beat and wanting to hear it over again. It is SUCH the tune for a club-- picture the entire crowd on the dance floor PULSING to the beat. I love this song. I will probably wear it out by overlistening to it and get tired of it in about 6 weeks, but I'll sure enjoy it until then. Cheers! LUV this song!"
1,"of course it sounds like soft cell,","For your information, SandyC, SOS was not the original song. It was ""Tainted Love"" and I'm pretty sure she just took the original background track, spliced and diced, and the final product is a lack of imagination!! Anyway, this song is like most stuff today: catchy, annoying, and un-original and anything but creative. By the way, this person calling themself ""SandyC"" says she is ""in her 40s."" She should know better by now that this music is [...]. You look at Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and even Dave Matthews Band, and all of their ratings are higher than this. No wonder!"
4,Magical Realism,"First a warning...to really enjoy this story you must totally suspend disbelief, you must not expect clean explanations, you must be familiar with magical realism.The first time I saw this film, I actually found it boring and confusing, but upon a second viewing, I saw all I had missed the first time around. This is a truly enchanting comedy about a young girl and her struggle to escape the grasp of her abusive grandmother. Few words are spoken by the girl, but she conveys her feelings with the haunted look in her eyes. It would seem that this movie was meant to be a drama, and it is, but it is also a bittersweet comedy that is ironic, satyrical, and deeply satisfying. Best understood when viewed twice."
2,bulky piece of tool,"I still haven't used it myself....the piece seems fine, but I wouldn't have bought it if it weren't on sale."
2,Missing piece,"This was a great price, though the stem to the screwdriver was missing when I got it. So, it's useless without it."
5,Solid and cheap,"I was quite impressed even though I got it in a buy x get y deal as a freebie. The wood grip on the screwdriver doesn't slip in the slightest. I would almost claim it slipped less than a rubber grip handle. I also put the screwdriver to the test when I lost my hammer, so I used the brass butt of the screwdriver handle for that job. I wouldn't recommend that if you don't want scratches on your tools, but it was handy for that. I care very little for aesthetics myself. I also love the lockback utility knife for having less chance of slipping and cutting through your pocket. Just fold it up like a regular pocketknife and it's ready to go."
3,Paying for looks; heavy,"These are useful tools for anyone doing any type of work around the home. The wood grips may get 'slippery when wet', but for the price, not a bad deal. They are heavier then comparable items (probably due to the brass content). Just wait until they get scratched from hard use!"
1,Sony Projection TV,"Sony 57"" model: KP-57WS500Very poor quality; Started having problems after 1 year. After 1-1/2 year, the technician came out and charged me $200 to adjust two screws and tell me all the CRT tubes (guns) were going out. I can't even find reference to a warranty in the owner's manual. I tried the Sony web site, and that was a joke. In closing, it seems that Sony products are suffering substantial quality issues, and I whole-heartedly would advise anyone interested in electronics to avoid the Sony namebrand. Calls and E;mails were not returned. Sony did not stand behind it's product."
5,A Must have book,"like all Meyers books, More Effective C++ is a must read for all serious C++ Programmer.If I would have to point out, what are the most profound ideas presented in the book, they will be:1.the 80-20 rule.2.Exceptions Handling (particularly exceptions which arose in Ctor/Dtor).3.the Reference counting Technique.another advantage of the book is, that it's well written, and fun to read.read this book - it will make you a better programmer."
3,10 years outdated,"This book is supposed to be an extension of Effective C++(Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs (3rd Edition)). However, the most recent edition of Effective C++ is 10 years more modern (1995-2005). Effective C++ already covers a lot of More Effective C++, and with more current details. Additionally, More Effective C++'s comments on efficiency may no longer be as relevant with advances in compilers and computer architectures.Just a warning. The book is by no means a waste of time, but perhaps your time is better spent finding another resource, providing you already read Effective C++."
1,Awful Kindle formatting for code snippets!,"UnlikeEffective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs (3rd Edition)this book is poorly formatted on Kindle (standard size). Code snippets are barely readable! The comments are put on the same line as code and because of line wrapping they are intermixed. This was somehow done right in the ""Effective C++""."
5,very nice,This grab bar looks great and went up very easily!!!!!!!!! I am very pleased with it. It has a wonderful finish on it and it still looks like brand new too!
5,Excellent book for beginners,"I read every chapter in this book as part of a Medical Terminology class I just finished. I was able to correctly answer every question in each of the 14 quizes and the final exam required by the class. The descriptions in each chapter are well written and the artwork showing body parts is very clear. The chapter exercises are also helpful in reinforcing the vocabulary. I briefly checked out the website for potential careers, which includes brief descriptions of several popular careers with excellent links for more information."
4,Oldies but Goodies,Even though these are old songs this is a good CD. I like it mostly for the love/sad songs. She can really get to you with her voice. Worth buying.
1,deceptive,"The multipet name and picture showing 5 dogs, and the fact that I can buy 5 dogs for $6 at petsmart lead me to believe that I was ordering 5 dogs. The picture is deceptive. Especially since you aren't asked to choose a color, as I assume would be the case if I were ordering only one. The material is cheap and is easily torn apart by a chihuahua. The older ""bobo"" toy that I purchased from petsmart 3 years ago is much better quality and stil in perfect shape. I doubt this one will survive through the week."
1,Rip off!,This ad makes you believe you are getting all the toys not just one tiny one.. Misleading and not worth the money.. Shame on you!
2,Once again i received this book and no words,"It seems that the paperback version is a picture book and the hard covered version has the words written. It did not state that anywhere, it took two tries and speaking to an amazon representative to finally understand what was happening. I don't know why anyone would want a book with mo words while they can have the written version. Amazon was great and kind enough to take care of the problem. I appreciate that but the fact that there are two different types of books should be clearly stated."
1,teeny tiny,this is a very small book that can fit in the palm of my hand. not worth the money. i should have payed closer attention to measurements
3,not what I expected!,"Being a huge fan of Eric Carle and a kindergarten teacher, I was fairly disappointed with this book....it needs words! The only words found in the book are in two speech bubbles. At one time, these pictures were published in a Big Book that included text entitled ""Will You Be My Friend?"". Early readers need simple text they can follow - not just pictures."
3,"""Do you want to be my friend""","This book is about a mouse that wants a friend so he goes asking other animals if they will be his friend. He asks alligators, giraffes, elephants, and other animals, but they all said no. So now maybe you can figure out the rest of the story.I think the lesson that this book teaches is that everyone needs a friend or you not going to get anywhere in life. I would say that the age level for this book is for three to eight year olds because it has mostly pictures and only eight words. It was an ok book and the good point of the book was that the artwork was really nice."
1,do you want to be my friend,I love Eric Carle books but did not realize how small this book was. I thought the price was too high for this size of a book
3,"Fun, little naughty book!","This is a fun, light, day at the bench read. The book is not to be taken too seriously, however, it does talk discuss a topic that hits home to some women in their 30's. ""Playing Away"" is Adele Parks first novel and I would safely say if she writes another one, I pick it up."
3,A golden oldie that doesn't shine anymore,"Well, when it was published in 1967 it might have caused a stir, but nowadays there are books as heavy as bricks about this plane, and they come in a six-volume package as well.Most of the books in the Aero Series stand out for having original photographs of good quality (mostly from plane at the Air Museum), but the recent hausse in Me262 books has swallowed all of them in those six blockbusters, as well as in most other references published since 1990.My advice: If you come across this book when you are on the lookout to complete this series, buy it. If however you want a good bookabout the Me262, spend your money on another book. To buy that six-volume blockbuster: bring lots of money, but you'll have everything about the Me262 you can think of, apart from the original plane itself."
1,Terribly awful,"I went for this CD in the dark. I had heard about BRide and, since this reissue comes in a very good package, with clearly visible lyrics, band line-up and a brief comment by the guitarist, I went for it, hoping to find some good heavy metal here.I was in for a negative surprise. Yes, it is heavy metal. And, yes, it's terrible bad. Bad production, annoying vocals, songs that go nowhere.I know this was their debut back in 1986, and probably there are better Bride releases after that, but the shock was so great that I do not intend to find out... ever."
4,Scrap book travel mug - a great gift idea,"I purchased and decorated this mug for an office secret santa party. The person I made this mug for loved the mug and the photos of her children I took off of facebook.She got a gift she would use, a beautiful momento of her children, and a way to display her own photography! All I did was arrange her photos in a computer program and print.It was an easy and very personal gift and she loved it! I still see her using her mug around the office, and it does not seem to have suffered any damage or wear in a couple of month's time being used."
2,Roswell: Case Not Totally Closed.,"Okay, let's say it was a bunch of dummies which were mistaken for living, breathing, fleshy, alien corpses. Let's say that the nurse at the hospital who drew sketches of strange beings actually saw dummies. Then why has the government made such hoopla over this case for 50 years? I mean, why have they kept on changing story after story when they could have simply stated: ""Look, it wasn't a UFO and the bodies weren't aliens. It was this and they were really this."" I'm not a firm believer in the existance of extraterrestrial life, but I'm certain something did happen at Roswell and we still don't know what."
4,Got it within expected time range.,"Not often, but I sometimes purchase thru online especially for the item that we should pay too much at the stores (like BestBuy, RadioShack, etc.). I ordered this item because of the price trusting the quality as normal cat 5 ethernet cable is almost same brand to brand.Got it within the expected time range, and it works alright with my son's laptop. I had to put some controling mechanism to block the wireless functionality of that laptop and I needed a long ethernet cable like this (50ft). I disalbled the laptop's wireless internet access by disconnecting internal antenna wires inside the laptop's lid (display I mean) physically and also disabled from the control panel as SW level.Hooked up to the home router the cable from the laptop, and it works great!"
3,good product but verry late shipping,the product is good but when i buy they promise to deliver with in 5 daysbut it comes after 15 days
1,NO stars for this NON Big Button Phone,"When they advertised ""big button"" I believed that they meant it. But this is NOT, I repeat NOT, a big button phone. If you are buying for a visully impaired person, or even just because you don't see as well as you used to, you're making a mistake!"
1,Not healthy popcorn,Jiffy Pop seems like a fun product and is easy to use but I would NOT recommend it due to the fact that partially hydrogenated oils are used in it. That's very unhealthy and not something you want to be feeding your children. You're better off popping your own popcorn and adding your own non-hydrogenated butter.
4,Good for its price,"It is a very beautiful coat for this price. The material is light yet very warm (though it's not a cashmere blend like it says on the site) and the cut is flattering. I did find the size of the coat runs a little big. I normally wear a small but I probably should have ordered a XS for this coat. For the most part, I'm happy with the quality of this coat. Only thing I can complain about is that one of the buttons fell off within the first two days of wearing, but other than that, the coat is very solid. Overall, I'm happy that I bought this coat."
4,Works but not well built,This product is obviously of low quality. The socket is not well aligned. It works well.
5,Great Read,This book is written by an experienced oilman. He is very accurate in his discriptions. I have worked in the oil industry for more than 30 years and Mr. Hooper has done a great job.Book has a very suprising ending. I highly recommend this book.
1,Never received ink! Amazon gave refund.,Not sure what happened with this amazon order from Bigg Supplies but I did not ever receive my order. Amazon gave me a refund.
1,HP 21 black ink cartridge,"I compared pricing to get the best deal on replacement ink cartridges. Amazon is the way to go. Excellent pricing, quick, fast shipping."
3,As good price as can be expected.,But took much longer to arrive than I expected. HP tries to ask a reasonable price for there ink cartridges ... but all manufacterers really shaft you once you have one of their printers.
4,Practical Advice,Good practical advice to set teh worried adoptive parent at eae about a lot of things.
2,knife nut,"Got this knife at[on] sale...not worth it (will return soon)the main problem - it feels so cheap. there are no blade play, and lock hold for a time beeing bet action isn't smooth. It came well oiled, but still opening feels like there are some sand in it.Bottom line not the best knife for a price."
5,Go Hawk!!!,"This high performance brake pads were great, i just wish that next time when i ever purchase this, it will come with the rotors too."
5,excellent,excellent service and exactly the product I was looking for. Will probably order from this company again.
5,It works well,The membrane (in conjunction with the carbon pre- and post filter) brought my water's dissolved solids down from 99 p.p.m. to 26 p.p.m. and eliminated the foul odors (chlorine and iron) and tastes from my municipal water supply.The price is competitive with what we have seen on-line and at the local big box hardware store. The shipping was free and more convenient than a trip to the store.
4,Good phone for elderly people,"I bought this phone for my grandma and she likes it! It's a simple basic phone, has no fancy functions to confuse her. Big buttons and lighted keypad are very handy for her arthritic hands and bad vision. The speaker and the headset volume are loud enough for her to hear clearly. It's light and comfortable to hold, the belt clip is a plus. It's a little expensive for a basic phone, but there are very few alternatives to choose from for elderly people."
3,Wenzel Oversize 5-Degree Sleeping Bag,"This product is very well made and the extra leg room is wonderful. The 5-Degree temperature rating is ridiculous. At 34 degrees I needed to add heavy blankets. Since I like the leg room and will only use it car camping, I will just add the blankets."
2,Dull,"I watched the first two episodes.The narrator's delivery style gets old very fast.The use of quasi techno pop pounding music, as if it will make the dull interesting, wears thin within minutes, and creates headaches thereafter.I really do not like this series."
1,Warning- choking hazard- not intended for children under 3yr.,"I was just about to buy this for my 3 month old when I noted a warning label-it stated that this toy is not intended for children under 3 years of age. Generally I LOVE the manhatten toy company...but, I don't know why they would create a book that is obviously for a baby but allow for a possible choking hazard.So, be forwarned about it. I do appreciate that the warning label is listed for this product; however, it would be very easy for someone to not see the warning since you have to scroll down to see it....Next time I suggest it being near the price of the product!"
4,Works great,I was happy to finally settle on this item directly from Amazon. The first one came in damaged and I had to send it back. The next one was fine and the exchange was fairly simple. I was easier that trying to return a similar item to a local home improvement store.
4,Completely addictive,"Being a friend of one of the composers, I am a bit biased. But Dana and John have put together every cheesy B-movie cliche imaginable. You feel as if they have watched ""Reefer Madness"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" one too many times. It harkens back to a simpler time when musicals were meant to be just FUN! These songs are going to stick in your head and the characters haunt you. I truly believe that this show will become a cult hit like ""Rocky Horror"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors"". This is a must have for true fans of B-movies and musical afficianados alike."
2,Interesting but....,"I would have to agree with the person who previously wrote about this cd. This musical could have had it all! It has a great sci-fi storyline, interesting characters, and an intriguing name, however, the cd drags on and on, leaving you feeling like, ""There has to be at least one good song here!"" If you love sci-fi musicals, buy the Starmites cd, or Little Shop Of Horrors. If you are into cheesy High School melodrama musicals, buy this. Don't be fooled by the title, its just not worth the money."
4,A very well done little show - fun and zippy,"This is a great score, with excellent casting on the recording. The melodies are consistently catchy, the lyrics quite serviceable (and occasionally very funny). and the vocal arrangements outstanding. An over-the-top, campy little gem. Very enjoyable - I hope it gets more productions."
3,Disappointing,"Just bought 5 Summer Stories and while we enjoyed the film clips, much of the orginal music was gone. What a dissapointment as this is 1/2 of the 5 summer stories. My husband is a surfer (40 yrs now) and has a lot of memorilbilla, and looked forward to getting this DVD, but was really let down by the music used (modernized). Bummer! Definately not one of his favorties in his DVD surf library."
1,All this over a couple pounds,"I exercised and dieted while taking this product. During the first month I lost a couple pounds; thereafter, I lost not an ounce more. Disappointing!"
1,does nothing good,"Horrible product! Should be taken off the market. The only thing this crap does is to make you crap. I tried for 1 month watching what I ate etc. Did nothing, but since I do not eat fatty foods at breakfast I skipped the 3rd pill. Just this week, I had a horrible accident while I slept and ruined my new King size mattress and sheets. (oil base stuff is very hard to get out) So please don't waste your money. PS not ONE pound lost."
1,New ones are not working like the old ones did,"I also have the same experience, new ones don't work at all. I also heard that they are really bad for you. Do some research about this and get your money back.Update, I got a ""bad bach and contact their co. they sent me an envelope to return them, I went ahead and purchase a second bottle from Amazon, first one was from Walmart online, so this second one is also not working. You know Alli works when you see the oily discharge when you go to the restroom. Apparently after been off the market for a while, they came back with a NON WORKING PRODUCT, I am sad SINCE i DID LOSE weigh THE FIRST TIME i TRIED THEM A FEW YEARS BACK."
1,stomach pain,"I heard from a friend that this diet product worked for her friend, i decided to try it. I had the worst stomach pain that didnt go away for a few hours, I couldnt move."
1,Dreadful Customer Service,I ordered this product from the United Kingdom and did not receive it even though I was told it was delivered. This company have refused to give me a full refund as they promise to do if you do not receive your goods. I have found Customer Service to be very patronising and always finding excuses. They do not seem to have set up safe delivery methods to the UK so I would strongly advise not to use.
3,"Works well, but what happened to the price??","5 star performance. 1 star marketing. I accept all the benefits and effects that come with use. Remember, it only works when you eat 15g or more of fat in a single meal, so save your capsules for when that will be the case. Two capsules (120 mg) is the prescription dose of the exact same medication and is even more effective. I like these and they do help with weight control, however, what happened to the price? About a month ago everywhere I looked it was sold out, and now it has gone from ~45 cents a capsule to $3 a capsule! Any ideas on why, or where to get it at a reasonable price? update - I have given up on orlistat and switched to lecithin granules now. Much MUCH less expensive, does the same job without being a drug (is natural) and does not mess with your bile. I read about it on earthclinic dot com. They are not a sales site and don't compete or sell vitamins, they are a [fantastic] health forum."
1,alli,I have not received it yet. I contacted you recently. Thanks for looking into it. Mary cecere. I will review it when I receive it. Have not received my face cream yet either.
1,Hmm..Here's a thought....,Don't you think that the low-fat diet you are on is what is causing you to lose weight!?! Save yourself $50 and oily farts and stick to that diet and exercise....
5,GREEEEEAT,I have been on this for 4 yrs and I love it. I will go off and on it but I have no side effects. It really works-especially if you just walk 30 min. a day.
2,Got sucked in again,"I took this product when it first came out. I did not lose weight. Since then I went to weight watchers and lost 30 pounds. I was on a plateau. Not losing anything for a month. I saw a commercial for Alli, and thought I would try it again. Third week and haven't lost a pound. Don't waste your money. I decided I have to get back to tracking what I put in my mouth.That seems to work best. I have always exercised, and might step that up abit."
3,it's ok,"I have been using Alli for three weeks I think, I have seen fat or grease coming out, and also I have noticed less fat around my waist , but I don't think this product is as great as other people rated."
3,looking elseware,"Alli 120 Caps Refill - Weight Loss Aid, 120 caps., (GlaxoSmithKline)tried the product for two months. i didnot notice any weight loss from the product that produces gas , etc."
1,Warning Fake Counterfeit,"I've tried the real alli and the current amazon supplier is distributing counterfeit pills. Avoid at all costs, contact the FDA since amazon is unwilling to resolve the issue."
5,Great Product,"Alli really works! I've been on Alli since September 18 and have lost 27 lbs. I tried losing weight before, I'd watch my calories, and fat intake, also would exercise but would not lose weight. I lost 7 lbs. the first week I was on Alli. I recommend this product highly."
1,Does not work anymore !!!!,"Started using this product last year with great results, then it went off the market due to the main ingredient shortage. Then about 2 months ago found it at Walgreens. Started taking it with no results, by that I mean no oily discharge after eating bad. Thought it was a bad bottle so last week bought another bottle at Costco, same thing no oily discharge. Sounds gross but that is the way you know if its working. Something has changed with this product and will no longer buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY. PRODUCT HAS CHANGED. DOES NOT WORK,"Alli was off the market for a while and is now back on the market. DO NOT PURCHASE IT. I used it for years and it was wonderful & worked great. Now it is being made by a different manufacturer and it DOES NOT WORK. I have wasted money thinking it was a bad batch, but it wasn't. After researching on the Alli website, everyone agrees that it no longer works as before. You do not see it working as before. I am so angry that Alli does not do something about this and warn everyone it IS NOT THE SAME! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED, DO NOT PURCHASE! I am hoping they will go public and revert back to the original maker. Until then, they just lost a dedicated customer."
4,Helps you lose weight even when you eat bad,"Alli totally helps lose those extra pounds. Even on a bad week (and a bad week means A LOT of side effects from the pill) I will lose a little weight. Taking Alli helps me stay away from the fatty meals like Chinese, pizza, nachos and hamburgers because I know that I will have side effects and if I am in public that is all the more embarrassing.If you eat within the peramiters of the instructions you will not have side effects. It is easy to take and I do not have side effects (orange coloring in the toilet and ""wet"" farts) unless I eat badly. I have not experienced any headaches or stomach pains like I often do with medication."
1,Only if you like oily discharge,"I was prescribed Orlistat by my Doctor(same thing as Alli), a bit horrified at reading stories where people claim they had watery stool all over their blankets and had to change their clothing. I was very careful not to eat burgers and fries, basically anything high in fat. Even with my special diet, I experienced oily discharge. Definitely controllable, those who mentioned it was all over their sheets must've ate fried foods at every meal. Ridiculous! I hated the smell of this grease and not experiencing ANY weight loss, I quickly stopped taking it. What a waste."
5,great,"i am just starting on these eating supplements,everything i have read up on them gives them a favorable review, so i am hoping they work for me."
3,Why is it different?,Two years ago before this product disappeared. I can say it worked. But now Alli is different it didn't work.
1,i received an expired bottle from DAB manufacture,"I am so disappointed, i was soo excited to purchase alli online. But DAB sent me an expired bottle of ALLI 120 CT...expired 8/08. So if your buying from this manufacture make sure you call them and ask them for a new bottle. and no i will not continue buying from them because i took 3 of the expired meds before i realize the date:(..."
1,One more comment,"This worked for me a little, taken 1-2 times a day, with all the ugly symptoms described, but when I went to have hormone screening done (peri-menopause), my vitamin D was extremely low, such that I was prescribed a super D supplement for 6 weeks. Vit. D is oil based, and Alli interferes with vitamin D absorption...which is necessary for calcium absorption; they work together. Definitely important for women of some age (or any age!). Not worth the depletion of D and calcium in the long run.Also, regarding fakes, don't know if I've ever received any fakes when I ordered from Amazon, but there's a website to help identify fakes through the FDA (fda.gov). There are pictures and clues to help identify."
3,Alli,This is a good weight loss program that works slowly over time. You do need to read the directions and watch what you eat.
1,Boycott Luxottica! Poor Quality! Poor Customer Service!,"Ever since Bausch & Lomb USA sold Ray-Ban to Luxottica Italy, owners of optical brands Bolle, Revo, Killer Loop etc., the overall quality totally sucks! I have a pair of Ray-Ban Aviators manufactured by Bausch & Lomb that consists of a sturdier, thicker frame. What really ticks me off is the lens quality! Ray-Ban sunglasses WERE known for their unique heavy, but not too heavy, tempered glass lenses. They are still tempered glass, but much lighter and cheaper quality. When I tried Luxottica's Ray-Ban Aviators on, I almost felt like I was wearing cheap sunglasses with plastic lenses. I would rather the nose bridge dig into my sinuses due to heavyweight lenses than wear cheaply made drug store quality sunglasses for $100!!! It is quite apparent that they are trying to starve the traditional Ray-Ban market and introduce new CRAP! I'm not buying it. To Hell with Luxottica! They can stick their inferior sunglasses where the sun don't shine!"
3,Of historical interest - original training films.,"This is not a ""Produced"" documentary for consumers. The film ""Trinity and Beyond"" is recommended for that purpose. These are original military films produced by the armed forces for internal use, documenting the effects and deployment of nuclear weapons. They should be viewed as such, as a historical relic of a terrifying time in our past. The quality is that of a typical 16mm film, and some show significant wear. This is to be expected, given their origin. If you have an interest in this aspect of our cold war history, these authentic films are for you."
2,Typical military video but full of cool information!!,"This video is a good example of a DOD or military documentary, a bit on the dull side but chock full of interesting information. If you plan on only buying one video about Nuclear Weapons then ""Trinity and Beyond"" is the one of choice. However, this video fills in many holes that Trinity leaves untouched because it talks to a different audience. Not a great video but one that is a good addition to your nuke collection."
4,"for those there ,lot left out","I got this for my Dad who was actually there for Operation Tumbler Snapper. Of course, the government left a lot out. Like how they did not have protective gear on, and swept the radiation dust off of each other with a broom. But it does show the bomb going off, and some tests. For those who were there and are still alive, they may want to watch this or not. Anyone who thinks this is a ""movie"" you are wrong! Real soldiers were in these tests. Remember who the heroes are here. Most who were there died of lung related illnesses. If you are interested in watching the real testing of atomic bombs , this is it. If you want a movie, go to Redbox."
3,Call,The book is very good and is very concise upto the requirement and relates to all the common aspects of the call centers.Our company has planned to open up a call center in India so this lead to exploring the contents of your booklet.The books is extremely the best among available.
2,Pretty dry for a travel book,"I'm a huge fan of travel books plus a Moroccophile, so I thought this book would be just the ticket. Unfortunately the author's style is quite dry. He spends a great deal of time visiting tombs and non-existent shrines to saints. Really, it's quite boring. What about the food? The people? How the author (completely fluent in Arabic) manages to travel through such an interesting part of the world and not have daily random travel adventures is beyond me. I've had more adventure walking down the street to the produce shop.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they were really into shrines or liked Arabic poetry.If you're looking for some great travel writing, try Bill Bryson's ""In a Sunburned Country"", Anthony Bourdain's ""A Cook's Tour"", or any of the short travel story collection books by Lonely Planet."
2,Ha!,"Mr Rollins, with this album, hereby proves that which me and every other sworn anti-man already knew-- that hostility and bitterness breed a very good sense of humour. I can't say I'm a fan of the second CD at all, and there were some parts that were so short that I wondered why they were even there (Vegas). Regardless, this CD was good enough that I almost felt a stab of regret for hawking it. Almost."
5,Family Matters,"I ordered this pendant for myself and was very pleased with it. It is lovely - the design is fluid and graceful. The weight is substantial, yet not overpowering for almost any necklace. I would suggest this as a gift for anyone who is observing a special occasion or for those who need solace during a loss of loved one."
5,Scholarly history at its best,An absorbing and beautifully written biography by possibly the leading expert on Equiano today.Caretta's revelation that Equiano may have been born in South Carolina rather than Africa only serves to make him an even more intriguing figure for those who are familiar with his autobiography. This is scholarly history at its best.
5,helpful aid in mother-daughter discussion group,We started our mother-daughter book discussion group 1 year ago and have found this recent publication to be extremely helpful. We pass the book amoung the members to aid in the next month's selection. The discussion questions are great and the activities help us get a start.
5,A great story for boys AND girls alike!,This is a great book....after I read my first 3 Investigators story I had to read all I could find in my school and public library. Don't be fooled folks...girls will like these stories as well as the boys. I always wanted to build a cool clubhouse like they had! This story has it all...action! adventure! plus a little brain work!
5,This will hit the best seller lists!,"Nurse Pauline Sokol knew she was burned out. Needing something new, her gay roomie, Miles, gets her a job at a company that investigates insurance fraud. Being somewhat accident prone and knowing less than nothing about how to be a private investigator, Pauline is in over her head and she knows it.Then Jagger steps in to teach her the ropes. In exchange for Jagger showing her how to be a decent P.I. and crack her first case, Pauline agrees to go undercover at a local health clinic to find evidence of medical insurance fraud for Jagger's case. Sounds easy until co-workers start turning up dead.***** This mystery will have you chuckling aloud as you try to figure out ""who-did-it"". This is the author's first debut in the mystery genre and I believe she has found her little niche! As the first book in a series, this colorful cast of characters looks to be on their way to the top of the best sellers list! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,Great .... But...,"Well, I really enjoyed this product but it broke quite soon after I started using it, maybe a week or so in - I was working as a stocker using it repeatedly for 8+ hours a night. I was impressed with it enough that I had amazon exchange it for a new one. I do not work in the same place now so I have not used it the same way, but the second one is still in good shape. I would not recommend this to the heavy user, but rather the occasional user."
4,Fun and easy,"We have had a lot of fun with this product. The recipe for the bubble solution is easy and can be stored for weeks and it only takes a little practice to get the hang of making the big bubbles. Granted, I haven't had luck with making the 10 ft. bubbles they mention in the book, but you can get some really big ones! Keep in mind that humid weather is essential for these bubbles, if it's too dry it gets frustrating. We have had ours for a couple years and it still works great (just rinse the solution out of the wand when you're done) so I've started buying them as gifts. We love it!"
3,bubble wand,"I purchased this item as a gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Although the weather on the day of her birthday party was too windy the kids still had a good time trying to make bubbles. Later when the wind died down we were able to have fun with the wand. We couldn't make bubbles ""as big as a school bus"" but my granddaughter had a blast chasing the bubbles that were as big as basketballs."
3,Interesting,"This activity book comes with it all. The book includes the amazing bubble thing with instructions on how to assemble and use it and step-by-step instructions on how to make the best bubble mixture including which dish soap to use from around the world. There is also a history of bubbles, and also instructions on how to make super bubble toys and tools with common household items. It also has a chart on what are the optimal conditions for creating bubbles. Should provide hundreds of hours of fun."
5,Great for those humid but not hot days,"We live in a valley where it's hot and I can say we've tried this in all types of weather, and have made our own bubble solution as directed in the pamphlet, and have had limited success overall. However, on a 'perfect bubble day' we have had some really great bubbles. If we lived in an area where the climate was not so dry, I am sure we would have great success. Foggy weather seems to have the best effect.We do love the product, and found the booklet to be extremely useful, just wish we had a better climate so we could make the monster bubbles we see in the pictures.I love the reviewer who is an engineer - that is another area I wish there were a little more info on - the physics and chemical properties of bubbles. The science of it is a touched on but not expansive enough."
1,"Survival in Auschwitz, Primo Levi author","The author surely did not intend that his experiences in Auschwitz would be so ridiculously and carelessly translated into English. This period of author Levi's life is filled with horror and fear and should have been treated with the dignity and respect it deserves. But, countless spelling and grammatical errors, paragraphs ending without completion of a sentence followed by a new paragraph opening with the remainder of the sentence from the prior paragraph crucify the flow and meaning reduce the story to unintelligible prattle. The Translator and/or Orion Press should apologize to the author and reprint the book in proper form."
3,Pretty good read,"Levi is sufficiently unbiased and honest in his depictions of Auschwitz. His account is not as graphic as most, and the book moves along fairly quickly. Pretty good."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I bought this book after receiving a recommendation from a store clerk at Borders, when I had initially intended to purchase Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning."" Now I wish I'd bought the latter because I just couldn't finish this book...I tried, and I really hate quitting on books, but it just felt like a very dry, tedious read. I read about 2-3 books a week, and I was struggling to read 10 pages at a time when reading this because I was just so phenomenally bored. I'm finally calling it quits on page 101."
1,Its complete crap,"This is yet another book where anyone who passed a high school bio class will know is crap. [...] he seems to have found a devoted crew of morons who believe that he really can cure all. If you ever go to one of their conventions, you'll know that its AMWAY for stupid soccer moms with allergic kids."
4,Minimal EBM !,"After purchasing the second Proceed CD (Neusprache) I picked this up too on the advice of Pontus Stalberg of Spetsnaz. He produced these two albums from Proceed and they sound Great! This disc is a bit darker and more melodic than Neusprache. Still has that minimal Ebm sound. Proceed still have that Orange Sector vs Spetsnaz vibe on this disc and I love it. I don't want to take it out of my disc player. My only disappointment about this disc is that it's too short! More like an E.P. Kinda Like Pontus Stalbergs Turnbull AC'S project. LOVE IT, but too short. If you like bands like Ionic Vision, Orange Sector, Spetsnaz, D.A.F. & Nitzer EBB, You'll Love This Disc!"
5,Excellent Fan,"Purchased 2 of these Lasko WindMachine fans back in Feb. 2012.I have been using Lasko WindMachine fans for the last 10 years, never a problem.MAKES A GREAT CIRCULATON FAN FOR A FREE STANDING OR WALL MOUNTED NATURAL GAS HEATER.Just place the fan aprox. 6 inches from the front of your heater, and swivel to the ceiling.HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN HEAT CIRCULATION THROUGHOUT THE ROOM!Enjoy"
5,Perfect!,"I own a Cafe Uno which I purchased several years ago. I bought it as I have a job which involves a lot of travel and I wanted something lightweight that I could easily pack in my suitcase. Cafe Uno was the perfect choice. I have used it almost every day since I purchased it and it has been a durable and reliable product for me. Using my favorite coffee and making it to the strength I prefer is a big plus. I'm back on-line to buy another, either to save for myself or give as a gift at a later time. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to brew one cup of tasty coffee to your liking, you can't go wrong with Cafe Uno. ps...I've been through several other one cup brewers that take a pod, they are all at the Goodwill!"
4,pleasantly surprised,"I haven't been in the market for a new cordless phone in awhile, and this is a great one with an answering machine. It was easy to set up. I love the internal phone book and light-up antenna. I have had no problem with static. And the speakerphone on the handset comes in handy. Another great phone/answering machine from Panasonic."
5,Works,"Works and functions as expected. No problems with no great expectations. When hanging from phone the coil extends down almost to the floor, but I have not pulled the cord to its full length. The coil could become looser with full length use."
4,Belkin 25 feet Telephone Handset Cord,Is ALMOST as long as I would want. The wall mount phone this is attached to is in the kitchen at the back of the house and I would prefer that it were about 5 feet longer so I can answer the front door while talking on the phone. This is the longest I could find.
3,Gets tangled very quickly,Decent if the phone doesn't get used too often. gets kinks and tangles very quickly compared to other cords I've bought. You get what you pay for.
5,Delivered as advertised!,"These cords are getting hard to find now-a-days. This was a great find, same quality as the one replaced in every way."
3,A Good Book about Cuba,"This is a good book for the ""armchair traveler"", and represents the Havana experience. For real adventure, Havana-style, read ""Holiday in Havana"", by Malcom Massey, 0-595-09466-X. It will rock your socks!"
4,Scooby Doo Fan,"My 3 year old loves Scooby Doo and Jeeps. I have washed the comforter several times and the color is holding up. I do put it in the washing machine and then air dry. It is average quality, like most kids comforters. It is a great addition if your child likes Scooby Doo."
3,Looks nice but questionable quality,"My son loves it, and the colors and style are very nice for a boy's room. The quality is questionable, however, it is already coming apart at the seams. It's also definately made for warm weather use."
3,Perwoll Black kinda works.,"Perwoll black works very well for the black part. Even makes slightly faded black look blacker. However, I found that it does not clean very well. With any spots or dirt, it is necessary to add something like Woolite to ensure the clothes are really clean. Also, it is inordinately expensive, I think."
1,These stink,"Don't buy these!! I bought this set of shower curtain rings and the rolling balls don't stay at the top of the ring. More importantly, the rings bend very easily and once they're bent they won't close again. There are way better shower rings out there for less money."
5,Nice Waffler,"I recommend this farmyard waffler. It has worked well for the last two months, turning out golden waffles with little effort. I have young children that really enjoy the fun farm shapes, and since it makes four at a time it does not take long to turn out enough for the whole family. Overall, it seems well built and I think it was an excellent value for the price."
5,Worked for my application,"I purchased this for my 1998 Chevy S10 4.3L. Was the right part for my vehicle, but I ended up not needing it since one came with my clutch kit (didn't know it did or I wouldn't have ordered it separately). Guess I just have a spare $15 bearing."
3,Bible comics,"Great idea with uneven results. Some superb art in places, but not always as an appropriate counterpoint to the accompanying Scriptures. The parts that do succeed are worth the cover price alone."
4,Gator GR-4L - 4 Rack Spaces,"Great For My QSC AMP & Furman Conditioner. I will buy again.Durable , Sturdy & Light Weight... And Minimize space in my SUV."
4,Counting and Sorting,"Who knew counting and sorting could be so much fun with the children. I purchased this item to use with some very gifted infants and they loved the toy. Not only were the children able to count the number of animals, but also knew where to store them. I could not use the sheep as they were a choking hazard (too small) but the others were just the right size. The children did place them in their mouth which was fine because they could easily be washed. The items are smaller then they appear in the picture. The children even enjoyed playing peekaboo with them. This item was a great buy I would recommend it especially since it is considerably cheaper here then anywhere else I had priced it. Only wished the exact size of the individuals animals was disclosed before purchase."
1,Displeased,I was not pleased with this product. Smaller than it appears and the child has to cram the animals into the containers.
2,Son never played with it,I bought this for my 18-month-old son. I don't think he ever even looked at after he unwrapped it Christmas morning. It is very cute but it just did not interest him at all.
5,"Simply put, buy this book!","Absolutely incredible! Buy it for all of the women (and men) in your life. This book is long overdue, and well worth the wait! --Lloyd Boston, author of MEN OF COLOR"
2,WW II,Good book. Very detailed and lengthly. Does help me to understand the events leading up to Wold War II especially with Japan.
2,"If you already own Electric Eye Dvd, this album is worthless","Seriously, Metal Gods is the only extra song on this version (although you can hear it playing during the credits, which pisses me off. Why didn't they put a clip of that performance?)."
3,Meh.,"If you even twitch this cable ever so slightly, you will hear the static coming through your headphones. Not the greatest thing."
2,okay but for lack of stereo,"There is disagreement about whether this splitter preserves stereo separation. In my case, it does not. I wish I'd been one of the luckier ones, but do you want a splitter that requires luck to work properly?"
5,Doubled my audio out on my computer,I need more than one audio out from my desktop computer so that I could connect my speakers and a set of wireless headphones for night listening.This did the job and I am very pleased with this purchase.
4,Satisfied,"I want to say thanks to Amazon for doing the right thing. The splitter that I received from an outside vendor was a cheap good- for-nothing piece of crap.I wrote a review, and low and behold Amazon sent a replacement no questions asked.This time I received a Belkin splitter. I have found no fault with the genuine Belkin product, it is sturdy and the plugs fit perfectly. Sound is OK too."
1,"Misleading picture, misleading reviews","I was specifically looking for a left-right channel splitter, just like the picture; one regular stereo 3.5mm jack to two separate 3.5mm jacks - one red and one white, for the left and right channels. Many reviewers complained about this cable only splitting the audio into the two separate channels, and that is exactly what I was looking for: a left-right splitter.I ordered this assuming I would receive the pictured product, the same one the reviewers were complaining about. What I got was a simple stereo Y-splitter, which isn't what I needed or wanted to purchase.If this seller actually has any 3.5mm left-right splitters, I would love to know and would gladly purchase one."
2,does not work with windows 7,windows 7 does not recognize this as an audio device there for it will not put out audio threw it.i bought this to be able to use my desktop speakers as well as my monitor build in speakers on my pc.does not work. not worth sending it back for $2.50
3,"It's a good jack splitter, however amazon still needs to change the picture.","This is a jack splitter, works fine, and though i do have a use for this (thus the 3 stars), this is not what i intended when i ordered it.What i was looking for was a 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Female Cable, which is what the picture details, this is not one of those, this is merely a jack splitter, which in itself is fine, however if your like me and aren't overly experienced in tech terminologies, you might look at the picture and purchase the wrong product like i did, so be aware of what this is.The product is 5 stars, however amazon get's 1 star for not showing the actual product, and thus the 3 stars."
4,Works as expected!,"There is not a whole lot one can say about a device so simple. It is compact, pliable, inexpensive, and works well. Yep, that's what I needed! This is a great option for portable devices such as DVD players, iPods / MP3 players, and the like when more than one person wants to use them simultaneously, but headphones are a must.... Just take care not to misplace it!"
1,did not work,It did not work. When I hooked up two headphones one sounded ok and the other was all garbled.May be just bad item.
5,Perfect!!!,Super cheap. My wife and I use it all the time to watch movie trailers on our phones. WE NO LONGER HAVE TO BUMP HEADS SHARING A HEADSET.
2,"Disappointed, not as represented, would not order again","I was disappointed in this order when it arrived. The seeds were packaged in individual paper envelopes which showed no information on planting depth, germination, sun, soil, watering needs, etc. There were also fewer seeds than the pictures shows in the plastic bags. It is too early to know how well they will grow."
4,Good product but not for clumsy hands,"This is a good solid product. Nice big handle and easy to clean. I like the design and the cover. However, the bottom-narrow design makes it easy to knock it over. Since the cover doesn't provide a spill proof function, you can have a big spillage. If you have clumsy hands or a cluttered desk, I wouldn't recommend it. This is also not microwave safe."
1,Silly creationist comic book,"A terribly wrong-headed book trying to prove creationism through fossils. Which is impossible to do in the first place, but even the attempt here is feeble. Don't waste your time with this waste of paper."
5,"Slow delivery, great product","First of all, it took several days for the product to ship. Once shipped it arrived in a timely fashion. Secondly, this is a fantastic product. It really keeps the sweat off your face and out of your eyes so you can keep riding. It is not perfect but with the amount I sweat I can't imagine anything could be."
5,SweatVac Ventilator Cap,"I have been using the SweatVac cap several times over the last couple of weeks and I am very happy with it. It does a great job of keeping sweat out of my eyes while I am biking. It is very comfortable and fits under my helmet with no problems. I wondered if it would make me feel a little hotter with something covering my head, but it really doesn't seem to. As I said, it is very comfortable and I would highly recommend it."
3,"Some Good Discussions, Often Poorly Illustrated","The book contains some good discussions on overpopulation, food supplies, water pollution and other environmental issues. However, more detailed introductions are required on plate tectonics and soils so that novice readers may better understand earthquakes and food production, respectively. Each chapter contains a number of useful math problems and thought questions. There are also numerous tables of data, which are interesting, but may overwhelm some students. Some of these data may be more understandable if they were graphed. All of the photographs are in black and white, but are usually satisfactory. However, many of the illustrations are only rough sketches and do not adequately illustrate important concepts for beginning undergraduates (as examples: plate margins [Figure 3.3, p. 75] and active and passive coastlines [Figure 3.21, p. 109])."
4,Rock Solid Camera,Have had this camera for over two years and it has functioned rock solid. I have no problems with it dropping the connection and the setup only took about 15 minutes. I have the camera sitting in a window and I am able to read a license plate a block away. I have the camera set up to cover my cars in my driveway at night and the low lux ability allows for really good viewing with only a street light as illumination. Price is a little steep but the lower priced D-link units are a big drop in quality and features. Not sure if the problems were with early units but I have no issues with this camera (other than Price).
3,"Promotes kindness, but...","Perhaps this book should have been called ""some nice and diverse things to do and help the earth while you're at it book."" My kids are 5 and 7 so perhaps they're too old to enjoy the simplicity of this book; for me, most of it just didn't translate as peace. For example, ""Peace is traveling to different places"" - uh no, that's just traveling. If a 19 year old goes to Aruba for spring break, that's not peace, it's a 19 year old going to Aruba for spring break.I gave the book 3 stars because I don't want to be harsh on a book that promotes kindness."
5,Finding the heart of the Bible in the spirit of the liturgy,"In ""Letter and Spirit"" Dr. Scott Hahn shines a bright light on what God does at Mass, especially through the proclamation of the Word. The proclamation of the Word in the Church's liturgy is something far more than reading scriptural texts. As Dr. Hahn writes, ""God's Word... when it is proclaimed in the liturgy, establishes the kingdom of heaven on earth."" This book helps us recover the real significance of the Church's Lectionary and the liturgy of the Word in the liturgical renewal of Vatican II. What power -- for individual believers, for the Church, for the world -- lies within the liturgical proclamation of the Word of God."
3,It's a phone cord.,"I bought this to replace my old cord which would twist endlessly. This was better for a while, but now, months later, it's the exact same as the old. Mr. Twisty McTwisty."
2,Fine but too short,"Good quality, but too short for the kitchen phone, unless one were to stand right next to the phone. Bought another that was twice as long. I think the length indicated must mean when stretched to capacity, not when relaxed and coiled."
3,12 feet is 4 Feet,"I read the reviews, not a bad product but my choices were1) Keep the 3 (2 feet at initial stress) foot Panasonic original cord2) 12 feet3) 25 FeetThis one starts to stress at 3.5 feet maybe and is pulling the phone around at 4 feet.I gave it 3 stars since it's probably my fault for not believing the reviews."
4,Decent 3 foot cord.,"As lots of other reviewers noted, 12ft is the full length of the cord; coiled/real use it's about 3-4 feet. Thanks to everyone who mentioned that!However, since I wanted a 3-4ft cord, it's worked perfectly fine for me. I just wish the official description had been more clear."
1,Avoid like the plague,"Ate the first tape, second tape played, third tape is now stuck in the machine as the eject button won't depress. Returned. The build quality is poor for a tape deck built in the 80's, I haven't seen something so cheaply made in some time...Don't buy this tape player."
4,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this inexpensive unit solely for the purpose of using it to record individuals that I would be profiling in the local newspaper. Since the purchase this summer, I have been satisfied with the quality of the unit's performance.For those seeking something of a higher standard, then money should be spent. However, for a basic recorder/player, one can't pass this one up."
1,Disappointing...Don't waste your money,I felt so compelled to save others from this headache that I decided to submit my first review.I purchased the tape recorder to use as a listening center for my classroom.The product is so cheaply made that the buttons stuck and froze from the start.The volume from the headphone jack was too low to be heard with a headphone.Don't waste your money. Spend a little bit more to get one that will work properly.The packing slip that came in the shipping box was the wrong one. It belonged to another customerin a different state.
1,"Oh, the agony of it all....","I am a long-time fan of Panasonic products and when (here it comes) Consumer Reports recommended it, I bought it as a gift for a friend. The friend and I don't speak as much as we did before I got the phone for her, because the thing doesn't stay charged. Shame on you, Panasonic."
1,What Battery?,"I concur with all comments concerning the battery. What a piece of [...]! Although I don't have this Panasonic model (I have a Panasonic KX TG2215 - unfortunately, a much more expensive model), the battery is equally worthless. I'm on my second (and LAST) battery within a year. I'm giving the phone to my girl friend's elderly mother who doesn't usually spend more than 15 minutes on the phone at a time, which is the absolute outer limits of the in-use-battery charge. I seriously doubt I will ever buy a Panasonic phone again."
4,Funny Show,"I absolutely love Ellen Degeneres, I think she is so funny and seems so nice and this complete first season of her hit show ""ellen"" is very funny. Seeing that I was too little to even remmember when ""ellen"" was on, it is great to see a show that was popular when I was younger on DVD and get to remember what the time was like back then. I only gave this show 4 out 5 because it doesn't really seem like it sticks true to Ellen Degeneres's funny side, but that all changes in the Second season of ""ellen"" when Ellen Degeneres seems to help write more of her own lines."
4,Great Buy,"Ellen- Season One does not have as many episodes as the other seasons so I went through them pretty fast. I like this season, but I missed the character, Spencer, who does not come in until the 3rd season. Of course, every episode is funny. Ellen is soooo witty and down-to-earth, you can't help but identify with her issues. I had a ton of laughs and am now watching the next season of the show. Ellen is one of the funniest people I've ever watched!!!"
2,Now I don't know what to think!,"I wish I had read all of these reviews before I purchased the book. I recently bought the book and went on a spree at the health food store! Then I started thinking about some things that don't add up. For instance we need protein, but her suggestions are to eat tuna, sardines, and rice and beans. Some options! I have been pleased with the recipes I've tried so far, and I intend to keep using many of them. However, they weren't written by a chef so they can be a little vague and hard to follow. I've decided to get a couple of other more highly rated books. I'll let you know how it goes!"
3,Fertility Diet,This book was good but could have been more detailed and i fealt it only hit the surface of this subject. It's a easy read.
3,The Infertility Diet,I found a lot of useful information in this book. The only thing is that it was missing the page on Red Clover page 239 and that was the thing I was most interested in after several treatments that didnt work I am looking for a natural alternative. This book does offer a lot of great diet information most I had never heard of.
2,Well intentioned but unsubstantiated,"I purchased a number of ""natural"" infertility books when my husband and I decided against fertility treatments. Although I think Fern may have some good ideas, it is dangerous for someone with no training whatsoever to put forth her ideas as facts. Don't eat soy? Soy is a great alternative to pesticide laced meat and poultry. I suggest books from people with SOME training. I found that most of her ""don'ts"" conflicted with the suggestions of professionals. Also, I found much of her suggested supplements advice worthless, as she never gives amounts/dosages. With that said, I located the yams (what could it hurt?) on the web at Frieda's, which is an African market. Good luck to all of you and stay strong."
2,View the difference between a sweet potato and yam,"I don't think this book does a very good job a describing the difference between a ""sweet potato"" (almost did a Dan Quayle) and a yam. Some pictures in the book would have been helpful. ... There are several sources, one in particular with illustrations. I was quite surprised to see that a real yam is black/brown. ...I'm very curious to know how many people have been eating sweet potatoes while thinking they were eating yams."
3,I love the oldies cartoons,"I love the old cartoons, but my childern want the new ones so I ended up watching most of it by myself. I enjoyed it."
5,Not Your Average Self-Help Book,"This book is magnificent...I read it in one night,because I couldn't put it down. If you are feeling lonely, unsure of yourself or where you are in life right now, or even just going through a grieving process, you must buy this book. I have anxiety & depression and have read many books in this genre. After reading this one, I felt as if I was not alone in my grief. We all struggle with our own demons, and this book teaches you how to battle them and learn to be yourself. If you are a person who is always the one who has to be ""sorry"" or take the blame - trust me - buy this book and you will learn how to assert yourself & finally say ""no"" tho those who use you as their doormat."
3,"Interesting designs, but overall disappointing","The book includes interesting and unique designs, but the level of complexity is high and overall I suspect that I will not try out any of them. I really wanted to see the entrelac design, but again, it is not really worth trying. I was also disapponted in the 'used' quality of the book."
5,Great valve for the price,We shopped the industrial catalogs for similar vavles. All were priced way too high for our little irrigation system. These valves are quiet and seal well. Do not leave them outside in the winter. Even with all the vents and drains open they retain a small bit of water in the solenoid. It freezes and ruins the solenoid. We have built a manifold using 6 valves. We lift the whole assembly off the house and bring it inside in the winter.
2,not s good as expected,"i have purchased other Nag Champas before and this is slightly weaker, and less ""champa-like"" than I expected. fast shipping though."
5,Enjoyed it,"Much like the first season, the second season of XPW was more shock and awe for me. XPW was a return to the raw and gritty nature that ECW used to be before TNN/Spike wanted it to be more upscale and glorified like WWE/WCW. XPW fans proved to be just as rabid as ECW fans. The matches were more of the same: crazy, violent, and unpredictable."
4,WaterCraft Mirror,This was mounted to a SeaDoo Sportster jet boat.It is a great product and holds up well with all the bumps and waves.I mounted it to the plastic storage cover above the steering wheel.I see now that it has cracked the area that I have mounted it to andI would advise that some care is taken to select a thick area of theboat to drill into and secure the mirror.
3,"Nice, but returned them","Tried these out for a few days, comfortable, nice sound, just didn't have as much noise canceling as I thought it should, especially for the price. really could hardly tell the difference with the power on or off, most of the noise canceling was just the ""ear muff"" effect. While the inline volume may be helpful for some, when connected to iphone/ipod it's just redundant and gets in the way. The batteries go in a funny compartment that seems like the door could break easily, the cord is a little thicker than most which seems more durableExchanged them for the Sony NC60's and couldn't be happier, much better noise canceling IMHO, just as good sound, slightly smaller/less bulky, the case is just as nice/sturdy, and for less than half the price you can't go wrong."
4,Vintage Sci-Fi!,I liked the story. Greg Benford is a favored author of mine so it was good to read some of his earlier work.The book was aged but stayed together. Well worth the purchase price.
3,Count of Monte Cristo retold,"As the title says, this is basically a retelling of Dumas' _The Count of Monte Cristo_ with some variation and dragons thrown in. Does this mean it's a bad book? Nope...still enjoyable. I've been a fan of Lawrence's works since his first Ethshar book and The Cyborg and the Sorcerer. Lawrence is a master of character driven (as opposed to plot driven) fantasy. Dragon Weather reads just like his Ethshar books: it is light, fast moving, and you want to turn the page to find out what happens next. Some may cringe at me calling it ""light fantasy,"" but that's what it is. There is nothing deep here except the development of the main character Arlian and all the situations he finds himself in (and gets out of). I have yet to find a book of his that has not entertained me. I look forward to the two concluding volumes (Dragon Society & Dragon Venom), as well has his new Ethshar books."
2,Most overpriced boombox ever,"Lucky for me that I didn't waste my money like my friend. The sound quality that they brag about so much is just a hair above your average Walmart boombox. With that said, this is probably the loudest system I have seen of this size. The lack of buttons on the actual unit is a huge annoyance - everytime you want to do anything with it you need the flimsy (and easy to lose)remote. This little overpriced boombox has trouble with certain CDs - especially RWs and burned CDs. Overall, this unit would be decent if not for the price tag. With the small space it takes up, and the overwhelming volume of this small unit - it does have a couple of perks, but not enough to justify the price."
2,cost of the wave system,"this little box may sound good, but when i buy a good sounding stereo, i pay for the actual components, not for the technology. i say from looking at the inside of the bose wave system, it should sell for less than 150 dollars. they would sell millions if it was priced to its actual value."
2,"just okay, I miss the old Bose","This is not a good product. This is nothing like the old Bose. The CD player skips most CDs. There are NO buttons, you need to use a remote (stupid design). Save you money, buy something else. And I am a long time fan of Bose speakers, but this upgrade was a big disappointment."
5,Bose Music System is Great,"This will be short. The Bose Wave Music System is everything that they claim and MORE! It's the BEST!REGARDS,DKFossum"
1,Bad Value,"For $250-299 you can get the Sony LBT-ZT4: a shelf system that plays both CDs and DVDs; has a multi-disk CD changer; has a USB port as well as an IPOD dock; has the controls on the unit as well as on the remote; has a graphic equalizer; and has a more full, powerful bass response; all features the Bose lacks. What more can I say? The Bose is a nice table radio but a bad value at $499. At best, it's worth about $150."
1,Silly and thoughtless controls,"I love my old Bose wave. Fantastic sound in a small perfect package. Unfortunately, the new wave DOES NOT have controls on the unit itself. Instead, one is forced to use a remote to manage functions. For parents, the cluttered or the absent minded, forget it. My kids would eat the remote for breakfast, and I'd end up with another piece of useless plastic. For my son, I just purchased a Tivoli instead. Both Tivoli and Boston Acoustics produce a fine product that doesn't require a remote. I don't think that Tivoli or BA produce the same sound quality, but what good is great sound if you can't access it? Whoever made the choice to 86 built in controls is a fool or an obsessive compulsive. Did they even bother to test this silly idea with their demographic?"
2,Was great in 1995 so so now,"The Bose radio and CD player sure sound great but sound is where the features stop. When I bough my first one (2005) I though it was pricey but it sure sound good. It lack, at minimum a battery backed clock. It really would have been nice if it had a radio controlled (atomic clock) but that may have been asking too much.I purchased the second one about 6 months ago for my father in-law who was turning 85. It was and received as a special gift and both my mother in-law and father in-law like the it. Where I find it falling short, at $550 is it lacks a HD turner and RDS to display song titles. Pie in the sky would be adding a USB port to plug in your flash drive with your music. I purchased a portable HD radio for only $39 and it has both features, and sounds really good. Come on Bose it is now 2010 soon 2011. Kick it up a notch on the tech side."
5,Love it!,Amazing device. I had a chance to listen to this music system in Las Vegas at Red Rock Hotel. Simply amazing. Back to NY I ordered one from Amazon. A little expensive bur once I received it I forgot about the price.For people that complain about the lack of buttons did you know that there is a Integrated Controller sold for $39 by Bose?http://www.bose.co.nz/site/images/store/groups/pg_00071-MANUAL.pdf
2,disappointed,"What a waste of money, and to think I sold my little AIWA CD player at a yard sale and bought this. The sound quality is just not there."
3,Nice but not $500.00 nice...,"My wife and I have other Bose products and wanted this radio for our bedroom. Amazon had the best deal with free shipping and a free Bose lighted deluxe remote but it still came with the hefty price of $499.00.My radio arrived quickly and I was excited to fire it up. I expected $500.00 sound but instead heard $350.00 sound. I tried AM, FM and CD with CD sound as the obvious winner but it still fell short of my expectations.Don't get me wrong, it fills the room with sound however it's just not $500.00 sound. I'm a believer that you get what you pay for but Bose fell short by about $150.00. Maybe that's why they threw in the lighted deluxe remote?"
4,"When the Remote Control fails, Bose steps up","I've had a Bose Wave II Radio for a couple years now and it has very good sound and it worked just fine until now when the remote started acting up--sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't work there's nothing to be done because there's not an on-off button on the radio itself.I had earlier posted a rather agitated comment here, and Bose found out about my problem because they monitor comments. They contacted me via email--twice--and offered to replace the remote free-of-charge. I'd already ordered one from their web site ($10.80 including shipping) so I declined their generous offer.Here's what I think. One, the Bose Wave Radio is a good product. Two, Bose sincerely cares about their reputation and their customer's product experience. Bose Customer Service is superior to many of the other companies whose products I've purchased."
1,A Triumph of Marketing Hype,"Make no doubt, this system looks beautiful, but Bose sells what they make, rather than make what they sell. This unit is basically a stylized boom box. Try a blind A/B test with a competing system and you will see why. If you like the sound - great. But you do not get your money's worth with Bose."
1,Adding my voice to the naysayers,"Like it says above...I've had this thing for less than a month and a half, have taken care to use it exactly as specified, but the problems with playing CDs mentioned in reviews below (not just CD-Rs, but full-fledged CDs) started not long after getting it out of the box, and by this point it won't play a thing without skipping, freezing or both. And I will say it has some nerve claiming in the booklet that failure of the unit to play CD-Rs is probably due to the recording process, when all of them play just fine on every other player I have. The sound quality wasn't bad when it did work, though not enough, I'm thinking, to justify the price tag. At the moment I'm thinking of just abandoning it by the road somewhere, but I don't want some other poor soul to find it and have to suffer as well..."
3,Great sound when it plays...,"I gave this system a try and the sound quality is great, however, the system stops playing CDs at ramdom times. I tried many differenct CD's, new, old, mp3, regular cds, no luck, I am on my third unit now and I will return it. All my other players play the CDs no problem. I am loosing faith on Bose equipment. 500 dollars for a system of this quality leaves a lot to be desired. If you decided to buy it, take advantage of their 30 day satisfaction guarantee just in case you need to return it. I have no coplains about Bose since they have been great with customer service but I simply can't go past the fact that I am on my third return and the problem is still not solved. I trully wanted to keep this machine but at a tag of $500.00 and cannot and will not overlook such a flaw.Manny"
1,American value: plastic junk at hundreds dollar a pound,"It seems that I am far from alone among those who find this plastic box doesn't work for many cds, some of which are even brand new by majors such as EMI, and all of which play perfectly in my much cheaper, Chinese made Sony cd players. After all, it is 21st century and cd player making has never been rocket science. Now this shameful $500 piece of junk even cannot get that right. Turning the box over, one finds ""made in USA"" on the bottom. No wonder! Such products will certainly become extinct in the near future and have nothing else to blame."
4,Don't buy as a suprise,"The sound is great, the look is sleek, but it looses a star for indescretion. The box is labeled boldly ""BOSE WAVE SOUND SYSTEM"" and even has several pictures of the item announcing its arrival. Maybe they could add on the box ""HERE IS YOUR ""SUPRISE"" BIRTHDAY GIFT!"" or maybe ""STEAL ME WHILE I WAIT FOR MY NEW OWNER TO COME HOME FROM WORK"". Enough sarcasm-I was deeply disappointed that my husband's suprise gift was a dead give-away when he got home from work before me."
4,Usefull,"As a therapist, I found this book useful to improve client's understanding their own unconscious process through the examples and metaphors."
1,85 minutes of nonsense and terrible acting,"The worst movie I have ever seen is Abandoned. It felt like a bad tv show or a really, really bad Lifetime movie. Plus have you ever heard of a feature film that is not animated that is only 85 minutes?Terrible script, terribly predictable story, With a cast of about 15 people total (including extras), it does not feel like a Hollywood movie.Do not see this movie."
3,"COuld be better, could be worse","Some of the songs on this CD are excellent (Radio Waves, The Tide Is Turning and Home) and the music for most are good (and far better than the horrendous music on Pros and Cons of Hitch-Hiking), but overall, the plot is fairly weak (something even Waters admits to these days). Definitely not among Waters better lyrical albums, but it's not among his worst, either."
1,"Radio Kaka, from the man who brought you ""Dark Side Of The Moon"", The Wall"" and others...","From the opening track, which is not only quite lame, but also the best one in the album, you can't help but wonder if his ego ever allowed him one second of regret for leaving Pink Floyd. Roger Waters' best days are way behind him. His constant bullying of the other members of his former band as well as technical assistants finally gave fruit when he was left alone to pursue his dreams of grandeur. For a man who despised his former mates, he sure milks ""Dark Side.."" and ""The Wall"" every chance he can, as no other artists or bands are breaking down the door to cover his later works. This album, s well as ""The Cons and Pros of HitchHiking"" deserve a worse and more humilliating death than that of the Soviet Empire."
2,"Too much message, too few songs","In thel latter days of Pink Floyd, Roger Waters turned his attention from proper songwriting to delivering his own political and ethical messages. In short, writing decent, cohesive SONGS was set aside. Which is a shame. Radio KAOS doesn't suffer from this as much as Amused To Death, but still lacks memorable melodies, catchy choruses and punctual playing. Instead, we get an album's worth of political and sociological commentary & criticism. Which is fine, but not on a rock record. Unless you want to delve deep into this modern-age protest songmanship, this record is a disappointment."
1,Do I HAVE to give this one star?,"Who here hates having root canals? Well, you'll hate this cd even more. Listening to it, one suddenly wonders how Roger Waters has made it this far. Life is simply not fair to have Syd Barrett end up how he did, and have Waters, a fat old geezer, dishing out this pseudo-intellectual garbage.As for the story line? It (...). Rent the movie ""The Boy in The Bubble"" and you'll be FAR more entertained. Better yet, to put it into terms of the era in which this was released, rent the movie ""D.A.R.Y.L"" (about the robot-boy-wonder-long-before-A.I.).Stay away from this one like the plague. It's not worth the cd it was printed upon, and certainly the liner notes aren't worth the paper they're on.However, if you're into collecting cd's as coasters or extra little ""somethings"" to prop up that wobbly leg on the couch or dining room table, then by all means, get it."
1,"what happened to you, rog?","I feel that an album of such trivial nonsense as this is beneath even Rogers contempt. Did somebody acually tell him this concept would be well received? Please, Roger, think (like you used to be able to do) before you act."
5,Preminision,Hard to beleve this album from 1987 includes the follwong passage.When the cowboys and Arabs draw downOn each other at noonIn the cool dusty air of the city boardroomWill you stand by a passive spectatorOf the market dictatorsWill you discreetly withdrawWith your ear pressed to the boardroom doorWill you hear when the lion within you roarsWill you take to the hills
1,Beware of the Kindle edition...,"I was excited to have something worthwhile in the realm of a harmony of Kings, Chronicles and Samuel. I eagerly downloaded this eBook and was immediately disappointed. It simply contains the text of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. Nothing from the author at all. I am not sure if this is an oversight on the part of the publisher/author or if it was intended. The hard copy edition may be very useful, but the Kindle edition is nothing more than the beloved Scriptures (including only Samuel, Kings, Chronicles) that you more than likely already have in every room of your home. I would not suggest it in it's current form."
4,THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE,I found the story thoroughly enjoyable but something was lacking -- Love the cover -- The characters are great -- the twist of the villian's identity was great --What can I say -- read it! You will like it!Maddie Griffin was possible -- but would her brothers get away with their antics?Tanner Blackburn and his family leaves you wanting another story -- Lauren could cause him some sisterly trouble and his brother Ronnie is ripe for another story [grin] I definitly like family stories to continue.
3,Not a good fanatic of it,The chapters are ok.I had to carry this book almost everyday to class!; its so big and heavy. And I also didn't like the examples and excersises of it because you can't barely understand them.
2,"If you're trying to teach yourself, do NOT buy this text!!","Although the reading level is extremely easy, the text glosses over or omits critical details. This lack of information makes it extremely difficult to complete the exercises.If you want to teach yourself, I recommend Intermediate Accounting by Dyckman, Dukes, and Davis."
3,"The book is good, but hard to understand","This book is well written. I like Intermediate Accounting because it is very specific and detail. However, the authors made the course very difficult because it's hard to understand without an explaination of instructor; plus the lack of solution made me very difficult to understand this book. I don't recommend to buy the book to study without an instructor."
5,You can't beat it,"When I got it in the mail I thought, ""Oh my God! Look at the size of this thing!"" However, coupled with an outstanding professor this book is great. I'd say that this book is truly readable and understandable. The exercises actually relate to the examples. Yes, in some exercises, you are often thrown a curve ball that isn't explained in the book but it makes you think. I'm very satisfied with the content and structure. This is a great reference as well."
4,"IT'S NOT LISZT OR CHOPIN, BUT IT'S FUN","I have always been a fan of Offenbach's operettas and cello music, as well interested in the composer himself (he was a fascinating character). I bought volume 1 of this series, having seen that it contained ""Zimmer's Waltz"" which was bequeathed to him by Rudolf Zimmer, according to Offenbach's biography, ""Orpheus in Paris."" I enjoyed the pleasant and melodic music so much that I bought the second album as well. This volume also has a transcription of the ""Galop infernal,"" which is a lot of fun. It is not 'tour-de-force' music, but both albums are delightful, and are excellent background music for reading or housework, as you can pay as much attention to the music as you want."
3,Used to love this show,"This has got to be one of the best shows created. Unfortunately for me, the last episode of the series ruined the show for me and I have not been able to watch it since (which is why what should be a five star show is getting a 3 from me).I do, however, recommend the show and may one day get over the disappointment of the last episode (last line of the closing, actually) and buy the series myself."
2,Scott Bacula at his best,What can you say? I loved the series and I am so happy the DVD's are available. They are well put together and the second season is jammed packed with episodes.Dean Stockwell in his prime and Scott couldn't be any sexier or funnier if he tried to.Well worth the money and worth watching over and over again.
1,Another music complaint.,I've heard about the music replacement and managed to cancel my preorder before it was shipped.This is absolutely unacceptable.Why do they even bother releasing the set if they mess it up like this?I was so happy when they started releasing the show to DVD - what a shame.
2,Love the show- hate the DVDS,I have to side with the rest of you- the shoddy reworking of the soundtracks for this presentation is not worthy of the show. SHAME ON YOU Universal!Guess I will be taping these from Sci Fi on my own DVD recorder and editing out the commercials later - I don't mind fast forwarding either.Fox did this to an extent with Roswell as well which is why I have taped a full set from broadcast TV. I believe that was due to Warner Brothers owning much of the music which was ok to use while on the WB but not for DVD release without paying royalties. Hey music execs and TV execs- why not offer a special original broadcast special edition set for more money? Fans who want it will buy it- other more casual viewers will buy the second rate soundtracks. HBO charges big bucks for their series and they are worth it- you get to fully enjoy your show as you recall it.
2,The music issues blew it for me,"I am yet another fan of QL that has a problem with the music. I was disgusted when I got to the episode ""Good Morning, Peoria"" and found music of the music altered. The replacements sound so generic, that it just blew it for me. Music makes the scene and it is something Universal didn't even bother with. If they couldn't get the rights, then they shouldn't have bothered.I even sent a complaint to Universal to tell them that as a fan of the show, I felt like my intelligence was insulted.I know it has already been said, I just wanted to add my two cents."
2,Isn't worth buying.,"My main complaint is the double sided DVDs.So far the first ep doesn't work right. Around 32 mins in, it stops working. I usally try to put movies on my Zune Media player. So with this problem with the DVDs, it's not possible. From reading other reviews, other people are having this problem. So far the music edited isn't a huge thing for me, since I can't remember much about the show with the music. I do think the music editing was a very bad idea though.I hope in the future, they will release the seasons on one sided DVDs, and with the music included.I'd buy them in a heart beat."
5,dodgy leaps,i loved quantum leap but for the life of me i cant remember .why at the end of 3 of the episodes i have seen so far on the season 2 boxset .sam leaps back into the colour of truth twice .and as the mobster from season one .does anyone know what has happened
1,Great disapointment on this DVD release,"I couldn't believe when I read that Universal had edited QL music on this DVD boxset. Music has been EVERYTHING for the atmosphere of QL since its first episode. I remember when I saw the first episode on TV, so many years ago, and went after the soundtrack of Picnic and my old Pat Boone's albuns just to hear those songs again. I did that all over the series and even put a lot of the original songs on a tape to listen in my car. I LOVE this series and can only join all the others that urged here for a real COMPLETE release with all original songs. I bought the first season box and liked it very much but fortunately I've read these reviews before wasting my money on this ridiculous edited second season. WHEN or IF Universal releases a real COMPLETE and ORIGINAL QL second season, I will surely buy it, even if it costs the double."
1,These are NOT the original episodes!,"BUYER BEWARE; music replacement at its most harmful... the dramatic impact of several episodes, notably the brilliant ""M.I.A."", have been dealt a blow with the removal of the original music tracks. They have been substituted by muzak. Universal thought they could pull a fast one and are ripping off the core fans. This show has an impassioned following and slapping artificial versions of QL on DVD doesn't cut it. Boycott this DVD and future releases until Universal treats Quantum Leap with respect."
2,Not what we originally saw,"Just to add to the music gripes...missing ""Glory of Love"" from Good Morning, Peoria...a truly well-placed song. I could have continued watching my old vhs tapes if I wanted to see the show again rather than think I'm getting the original series on dvd. And no bonus features!"
2,"Hey, Can we demand our money back?","I haven't watched season 2 yet (on dvd), but after reading all the reviews, I had to go to the last episode to see what everyone's talking about. What a dissappointment having ""Georgia on My Mind"" gone.Season 1 has 3 dvd's. Some actual thought was put into it. Then season 2...what were they thinking?!. I would not be upset if this was indicated on the box that music, editing etc was ""played"" with. But the box said ""COMPLETE"" second season. It does NOT say anything about taking the original music out.So is it false advertising? Can we get our money back. Should I wait 4-5 years for the un-edited version of ALL the episodes?Oh well, back to finishing Season One."
2,rip off,"I'd send it back but I've waited too long to get all the shows on DVD. They changed the music. Yuck. They used two sided disks which don't want to play in all the dvd players. And they say right on the box there is bonus material on Disk 3, side b and there isn't any. It was like trying to watch those rip off dvd's from asia."
3,not want you expect,it is okay if you like a more artistic form of horror. david bowie as a host is excellent No vampires in this one
2,wrong description or wrong product........,"The product was fine if they were trying to sell a Hellraiser 4-disc set instead of a 6-disc set. In which, was what I thought I was purchasing. I would return it if my kids did not already open it. As for the product, it was a brand new 4-disc set of Hellraiser. What's not to like about that. I won't buy from this seller again."
1,Elimate Captioning,"Speaking for this Hellraiser series except for new DVD release Hellrasier 3 by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment production. Previous Miramax DVD productions have closed-captioning or English Subtitles but almost all of Echo Bridge Home Entertainment DVD productions has none. Sucks to be deaf, eh?"
5,Magnificent,We were thoroughly delighted with this flatware and we are going to order more pieces. It is a simple pattern and fits any decor.We gave away our old flatware to Charity once we set eyes on this Ovations Oneida Islet. Thank you for the swift delivery
3,Solar Lab,This lab was purchased for my grandson. This father said the solar panel didn't work. But that he could replace it easily. The remaining parts of the kit were usable and my grandson and his father enjoyed it. Not sure if I'd buy it again.
3,"$160 definitely not, $69.99 May by, $49.99 OK but not great","I got this set for $49.99 [In fact I got this set + oneida 20 piece set i.e. set for 12 for $63 shipped]. Same week a 93 piece set (for 12) went on sale in Cost-co for 69.99+tax (Original 79.99). I bought that one too so that I can compare when I get the Oneida set. After comparing apples to apples, I can confidently say that this is a great starter set but not even close to the one i purchased from cost-co.Quality and finish are nice. I like the dune finish which is sort of dull chrome. Some pieces are showing dot of rust here and there (though its all stainless)."
4,Delicate Beauty,"These simple earrings are a great gift. They are suitable for younger girls, but also for grown women. I get many comments each time I wear them. They are simple, but very well done. Very very nice."
5,good book,I liked this book very much and it was a pleasure to get through it. I have taken other english courses in the past however this book got me to understand so much more.
1,Couldn't Finish the Book,"Ugh! Another book where the heroine is flat-chested. Even the hero commented that she was the flatest female he'd ever seen! Could NOT picture this guy, who LOVES women with big breasts being even remotely attracted to this prude. I couldn't even get halfway through the book."
5,Great product as always...,"I've been buying these for the longest time. Although you do have to put them together yourself, it's well worth it, in comparison to the price that you pay for the fully assembled ones. Only other thing I could recommend is that they add an extra frame since they seem to get worn down a bit after a while. I keep my old frames so that I can pre assembly my filters before I change them out."
2,fall apart !,"after first use, it starts to fall apart . after second use i throw it away . not worth it ! with a brand name like this,i thought they could last longerr."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this mobile, and we assembly all the parts with the batteries and it doesn't work. Also we read all the instructions, and we wrote an email to fisher price costumer service. Bad product, we don't recommended."
2,"Too heavy for the crib, going back","This mobile is way too heavy and big for myBabyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone, which is by no means a flimsy crib. The whole thing feels top-heavy and leans towards the inside of the crib when installed. The clearance between the bottom of the mobile base and my 6.5"" mattress is also less than the 7"" minimum required according to product instructions. On top of that, the music is way too soft even on the highest setting. Therefore, the mobile is going back."
2,Doesn't fit on my crib,"This looks like a very nice product, but the bracket to attach it to the crib didn't fit on our crib. Its small and leaves only a narrow space for the railing it sits on. If you have a convertible crib with a thick top railing this probably won't work for you. Instead we got the Fisher Price Precious Planet mobile with the projection, which attaches with straps and is more flexible to the size of your crib."
3,"Not the best, but definitely cue","Mobile is just as described, matches the bedding set I purchased, so that is why I bought it, going with the theme. Not the best quality Mobile, but definitely cue and will work."
5,WILL BUY THIS MOBILE OVER & OVER AGAIN,My son is now 3 months old and since he was born he has been fascinated with this mobile. He does not take his eyes off it. He finds the movement of the leaves intriguing and he is attracted to the bright colors. I highly recommend this product to anyone no matter what theme your nursery is...like I said my son loves it and it's been the best product we have bought for him.
1,Don't waste your money...,"We bought this even after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I sure wish i would have listened to the reviews instead of wasting my time and money. Like the other reviews stated, the music is very low, hard to hear unless you have a completly silent house (and who does), the light is very dim, to dim to even see the mobile in a dark room in the middle of the night, so what enjoyment does the baby get if they can't even see it. And the remote doesn't even work very well, in the middle of the night you have to activate the mobile manually first before the remote will work, doesnt that defeat the purpose of having the remote in the middle of the night. I will be returning it and getting something different."
5,love it,"My son is 3 months old and he can watch this mobile for hours. It's bright and colorful, i like the selection of music. It has the right volume for a baby. I even catch myself watching at it sometimes and it comes with a remote so you can stand outside the room to start it up. Love it!!!!"
5,loooove it!!!,this thing is awesome!! my 3 month old son adores the mobile and the music is very soothing!!! love the remote too!!
1,Stopped rotating,"After using for just one month, the rotating part stopped working. Just the music box alone is working. Called the service center people but was not helpful. Waste of money."
2,"Stops moving after a week, gets stuck!!",Length:: 1:16 MinsI Bought this Mobile and it stopped moving in two weeks per the attached video. It works fine if you remove the fabric leaves that come with it. I would recommend this if you are ok this happening as a couple other people have pointed it out in reviews. However the fact that it stops working deserves low marks.
1,Cant hear the sound/music,I bought this product because of the high ratings but the sound or music is very low. I can hardly hear it. I am exchanging it for a different one.
4,"quality baby mobile, only a few small complaints","overall i'm very satisfied with the mobile. it's coloful and eye catching, the leaves oscillate up and down as the animals rotate.the way it attaches to a crib, it would work best for level top rails, that don't extend solidly down too far (< 4"").it's a little quieter than i expected, but that's good and bad."
1,Not Star Worthy! The worst mobile EVER!,"This is by far the WORST crib mobile I have ever had! (As a NICU RN I have worked with many babies who had crib mobiles.) This is my 2nd mobile of this make and model. The 1st, and now the 2nd, do not work! I followed the directions to the 'T'...and the music sounds as if it is dying...and the motor worked for all of 2 seconds (with both #1 and #2)! Now on my 2nd mobile (bc I returned the 1st)...and this mobile does not even work..AT ALL! Brand new batteries...and the mobile will not function! No music! No motor function! The same batteries work in the cradle swing... I am sending this mobile back and never purchasing another product from Fisher-Price! My daughter is 3 months old and we are on our 2nd FP cradle swing...and 2 mobiles later... I am D O N E with FP! FP needs to improve on product quality...to say the least!!!"
2,Not worth more than $25...,"Pros: The songs are soothing, you can choose a combo of lights/music/both, there is an option for white noise (forest noises), remote control, 2 volume settingsCons: To attach the mobile to the crib, there is a long peg that comes out the back of the music box part and then a plastic washer that is supposed to be screwed onto it. The tension is not enough to hold up the mobile portion-it immediately tipped forward. Rather than return it, we just secured the mobile by tying a strap from the bottom of the mobile pole to the peg. This is a pretty major design flaw, which is why I don't think the full retail price is fair.I was able to buy this on sale for less than $30 and that seemed a fairer price."
1,"Cheap feeling, uncomfortable to the touch","This is an example of an item that is best purchased in a bricks and mortar store. It looks so nice in the pictures and description. I was expecting a classy, modern flatware set. Instead it feels too light, and is awkward to hold (the pointy handles make it uncomfortable in fact). At $.., you can do better at a Bed Bath & Beyond or Macys."
5,The best book ever.,"I am the scandinavian renderer of this, the gre-atest, book on earth.Would just like to say that since Koontz's bookswere occupied by a larger publisher in Sweden, andI found Her Majesty the Great Violet Mary Firtha.k.a Dion Fortune, I was not the sorrier forthat.And this is the first, and this is the best,I've ever read!A great casting and a series on english TV...How can they (UK) have missed it???They are visionary (as expected of a visionary)to the maximum, and pure manuscripts, maybe toogood for Hollywood..."
1,Broken Emerge Retractable Mouse,I had a similar product for over 3 years - excellent quality and comfortable for small hands.The new one I just bought in 2009 doesn't work.Too bad. The store doesn't honor the warranty. Probably best to buy this one directly from the manufacturer.http://emergeretail.com/ProductDetails.php?RECORD_KEY%28Products%29=ID_Num&ID;_Num(Products)=90
4,Small but fine,"Nice and compact. Keeps out of the way when I travel, yet easy to use without the bulk of a regular mouse. There is enough in my brief case already. Why add more? Does not cramp up either. Not too small."
2,So cheap!,My daughter did not like this DVD. It is really cheaply made. It sounds like they used a computer generated voice to say the spanish pronunciations. We had fun repeating the monotone voice. But I am guessing that is not the point of the DVD. It is really bad. Save your money and let your child watch a small amount of TV in Spanish.
4,WATERPROOF MP3!,"Well,I've had this product for about a week now and I havent had any problems with it. When i first pluged it in, it turned on and then went off but I soon found the problem was I had not inserted the USB 2.0 cable far enough in. This fixed I have so far had no problems with it. The radio works great, I use it at the gym where they have TV's on radio FM broadcasters and its fine. I used to have a sony sport armband radio for working out and it was a lot bigger with no storage. It also had a hard time picking up the signal in some areas of the gym and the cord was really use. The oregon has had no problem with this and I am happy with the product. The 256mb is plenty of music for a workout, but if your looking for stricktly an MP3 player check somewhere else. I would rate it a five if they supplied an arm band or something for running but all in all I am happy with it."
2,Gave it away,"I got this for swim training. It works fine out of the water, but in the water the sound quality is horrible. Plus the earbuds kept coming out. I gave it away (to a non-swimmer)."
1,terrible scale,"Scale has four sensors in its legs. If a person puts more pressure on one side or the other, the scale cannot get a good reading. The remote readout is screwed up and does not give a good reading."
2,Not as reliable or simple as it should be.........,"I am an electrical engineer and am very comfortable setting up electronic products, simple and complex.This scale and wireless remote is just too complicated for the average user, and really doesn't work that well besides.Both the weighing platform and the remote display have reset buttons. Until they were each pressed several times, the base and remote did not communicate at all.The display setup is cumbersome, and worst of all, the remote display does NOT consistently work properly.Half the time the weight does not get displayed on the remote display. Getting off the scale and starting over usually fixes it the 2nd time.On the plus side, the scale does seem to be accurate and make consistent weight measurements. Since I am near sighted and wanted the much larger and easier to read remote display, the fact that it only works half the time makes this scale a very big disappointment."
2,accurate weight watcher,"I bought this item to check the weight gain or loss for my daughter, She is a heart patient and needs to keep a very close check to see if she is retaining fluid, I was very disappointed with it because it was very hard to use and did not give the same reading twice in row in successive weighs. Was unable to use it for this purpose."
2,Large crystals; expensive shipping,"I purchasedPestell Clear Choice Crystals Cat Litterto use with theScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box. We found the size of the crystals to be too large to work effectively with the ScoopFree. The crystal litter gets pushed to both ends of the litter box. This is not a problem with FreshStep crystals.The litter is also fairly pricy, especially when shipping is included."
2,Odor Deal Breaker,"This product seemed like a good idea, but I would buy a more expensive brand. I bought it to use with my automatic litter cat litter box. It wasn't as good as the stuff that came with it. Also the crystals were bigger, but that was minor. It did a far job absorbing urine. What was the deal breaker was, was the odor. I came home 1 week after changing the cat litter I smelled a stale odor in the house. Specifically the smell of cat pee. As soon as I went downstairs, I knew what the problem was. Don't cheap out. Buy something better."
2,Don't get too excited about this one,"The most valuable part of the book is the product reviews; the recipes, however, have little or nothing to do with the products or with ""baking on boat and trail."" I mean, I don't know about you, but I don't need a recipe that makes 3 loaves of bread when I'm camping. The product reviews are available on line; save your money."
1,"I really wanted to like this cookbook, but can't","This cookbook should have been useful to my husband and my camping way of life. While the product reviews are useful, the recipes are awful. I am not going to be making 3 loaves of bread in my little portable oven. It is clear that they did little to establish a systematic approach. I found at least five different names used for what I believe must have been all-purpose flour. The recipes are also poorly organized. Usually the ingredient list is in the order that each ingredient is used, so that when you get to the last item, you know that you have used all of them. Instead of their recipes, it would have been better to have a chapter on how to convert recipes from traditional kitchen recipes to camping recipes with the use of dried ingredients."
4,The Moses Story Revisited?,"The hero myth didn't begin with the Moses story of the Israelites' slavery and liberation from Egypt, and it won't end with Way of the Pilgrim. Humans have been telling this story since the beginning of time, and let's face it, we love the tale. If you want to read a riveting story about enslaved humans and a flawed hero who finds that his true mission in life is to free his people, bad guys who get their come-uppance from one they have ""adopted"" and trained, all woven into a science-fiction tale complete with 9ft tall aliens, this is your book. Be patient -- you will have to weave your way through a lot of words, but I think it will be worth your while."
4,great replacement,"Very easy to use, great price, works efficiently, and easy to replace and swap out the old"
5,Essential Fun For Fleming Fans,"After you've read all the Bonds, there are two books you should read: ""Colonel Sun"" and ""The James Bond Dossier,"" both by Kingsley Amis. The former was the first of the official Bond novels authorized by Fleming's estate, and the latter is the first serious study of the Bond books, written when Fleming was still alive. The dossier covers the books' themes and commonalities and flaws, always with a loving eye.If you love the Bonds as the light entertainment they were intended to be, Amis shares your enthusiasm and adds some insight and perspective. Well worth perusing."
2,bland and simple,"I read this book as a child so it was good to have a chance to read it again. The difference is that now, I have airbrushed for over 25 years and my knowledge of airbrush is far more advanced from what this book talks about. For an experienced or even novice painter with an airbrush there is no knowledge to gain. As a collector's item and item from the late 40's the book is interesting - it has a nostalgia value. Some of the illustrations are good but unless you have a craving for vintage mechanical illustrations, this book is boring and not worth the expense. I wanted to like it a lot more but my memory was different from the reality."
2,Yawn!,This book was better than Ambien. It was very predictable and not at all what I expected from such a great storyteller.
3,Not one of his best,"Even though I'm a big Dean R. Koontz fan, I have to say that Icebound was a big disappointment. He should have made this one a VERY short story. He took too long to get into the plot. Usually, I can read a Koontz novel in 2 or 3 hrs. because he draws his readers into the story from the start, but this book took me a week to read & only because I was determined to finish it once I had started."
1,Farfetched and dull,"In this novel's defense it moves very quickly. On the other hand the whole concept of drilling an iceberg for freshwater (though intriguing) in my mind falls on its collective rear end. The characters are all very cardboard, you feel like you know them within the first few pages because the author describes them and they behave according to stereotypes.Finally...the rescue with the submarine? Please. I also was quite surprised the bombs did not have a fuse that could be set off by a pulse or whatever...but I suppose it becomes more intriguing this way. I had not read any Dean Koontz before this novel and it is not encouraging me to start. Please do yourself a favour and avoid it."
1,Unbelievable!,"In reading the reviews of this so-called, awful novel, I don't see where these people get off stating that it was a good book. I could'nt even get past the 2nd chapter, cause I did not understand the message Koontz was getting at. Very, very confusing!"
5,"Icebound chills you to the bone, then warms your heart.","Icebound is true action-adventure to its depths. This thriller pits man and woman against the ferocity of nature, bad luck, evil, and even the weaknesses of human character. The narrator John Glover is gifted. The description is breathtaking. The players that overcome gargantuan odds against them will warm your heart and convince you that the human spirit is imbued with spectacular strength. These characters live and breathe"
3,"a good job,but displays some ignorance",Smith does a good job in refuting the dualistic god. But this is not what is meant by God. God is existance. God is another name for reality. How can any atheist refute that? All religions believe in this God. I wish authors such as smith got their theology straight.
1,Lean Not To Your Own Understanding,"There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. Proverbs 14:12The LORD confides in those who fear Him, He makes his covenant known to them. Psalms 25:14"
2,A view of atheism,"I think it's interesting how Christians AND atheists feel as if it can prove one side to be right in a space as small as a book review. The issue of an existence or non-existence of God cannot be explained away through definitive statements. You can't just say PROVE IT because you can't prove to me that there isn't a God. It is important to read GOOD representations of both sides. Read this book on atheism, but also read a book on apologetics, perhaps by Geisler. Neither side is going to be able to PROVE anything (or else there would be no debate), but I've just found through investigation which side I find to be more probable, which is the existence of God. It is possible for intelligent people to believe in such a thing, and also to not believe such a thing. Let's try to meet each other on equal levels."
2,"No Real Problem, Except the Insults","Ok, now I have nothing againts Atheists (I am a Christian), but as I looked into religious books in a bookstore, I saw this and was curious so read a few pages. Quickly I learned that many of George's points are insulting God-believers, saying Christians are irrational for believing something so absurd? Being Christian, yeah I shouldn't have looked at it in the first place, but not only is this man trying to prove points about Atheism (and even though he says he is not, he is trying to turn people into Atheists) but he insults God-believers on many levels. This is a Christian-cruel man who may or may not realize what he is saying. I could write my own book on proving points in Christianity, but he shouldn't talk the way he does. I'm not giving it one star because he does have some good points for you Atheists out there."
1,Logical and rational?,"Hmmm. What do we have here? A rational book? On page 17, our friend George H. Smith asserts that ""the existence of God is impossible."" Later, on page 61, he says ""We may state, with certainty, that God does not exist.""Here we have a man, who many people believe to be rational and logical, asserting that he knows the answers to the eternal philosophical questions - that ""God does not exist"".I think it's time we sent Mister Smith to the loony bin. Open your minds please."
3,http://www.infidels.org/infidels/products/books/,"_Atheism: The Case Against God_ is one of the most popular books on atheism ever produced, no doubt because of its non-technical style. If you want a thorough case against theism, go with J.L. Mackie or Michael Martin instead, but if you are after a readable starting point for studying atheism, Smith's book is well worth the price"
3,Returned it,"I wasn't happy about the fit with the First Years True Fit Car Seat I had. The web site said it was compatible, but I did not like the security of the attachment on the bottom where the car seat attaches and having to turn it upside down to get the seat attached was not acceptable. It may be that it fits fine with other car seats. I elected to get the Britax seat with the Britax car seat traveler knowing that they would be compatible."
2,Poorly executed guide to writing critical film reviews.,John Moscowitz poorly executes a mini-textbook on how to write critical film reviews. He takes a series of student papers (presumably from his own classes) and presents them with repetitive commentary echoing what the writer has just said.A better idea would be to read an actual book of reviews by a single author such as the Roger Ebert ones or any of a number of other critics.
4,Saves money,"I've used this for the past 3 + years. It's saved a bunch of money and time since there's no more taking the car our for the oil change. My only complaint is the tank will tend to collapse with warm oil and some ambitious pumping. The pump itself shows no signs of failing at this point and the check valve on top still works without flaw.When finished, I raise the tube up to drain into the tank. I wipe it with a rag and then stuff a paper towel into the tank end. I haven't had much trouble with drips. Good product"
4,Does what I need it to,"I bought this case for my iPod video 30 GB. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had a problem with the fit--it seems to fit snugly in the case. It's also true that there is no plastic covering where the screen goes (and thus no extra protection, but I'd rather avoid the potential glare there and am content with my iPod's screen cover. The headphone jack hole is nice, as you can listen to the iPod while its in the case, and the product also features a belt clip. It does have a tendency to lock my iPod when I pull it out of the case, but that's a minor issue. I've been happy with this product overall, and it hasn't scratched my iPod like I've seen other cases do."
3,Seems familiar,"This was a fun book, and if you are a fan of Janet Evanovich, you should like it. That is because there are some striking similarities,especially the incredibly handsome and sexy mysterious man in black with a single name. There are numerous character parallels.But it was an enjoyable read."
4,"Not her VERY best, but a work of art none the less","I'm a typical fan of BS, but that doesn't make me aprtial. I know thsi is NO masterpiece by all means, but it's a nice efford the the best cd she had cut sine the mid 60's. This cd is a good pop album, nothing too artistic, but it's not as shallow as many of her other more commercial releases from this perios. A ncie album, with a nice flow of song.Bottom line: Don't go out of your way to acquire this, but if you are a FAN-atic of Barbara's, go ahead and indulge yourself, in one more slightly better then mediocor releASE"
1,A Barbra Fan- but this one's a stinker,"I am truly a fan- but I recently listened to an old cassette of this album and struggled to get through it. Except for a few tracks (On My Way to You and All I Ask of You), this album is embarrassing. It has not aged well and ranks, in my mind, as one of Barbra's worst efforts. I actually threw the tape away- a first for me!"
3,Pet crate meets airline requirements but is still rejected by airline.,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with this product; however, the airline decided it was too small. Although it meets their exact specifications for containing your pet, they would not let it be used and the flight had to be rescheduled."
1,Kennel Junk,I cannot believe that anyone who had actually purchased this piece of JUNK would actuallygive it a good review....Does Amazon pay people to give good reviews ??
4,Compact and Cool,"This mini Zen Garden is definitely something for people interested in the gardens. It is a great way to have the beautiful garden on your desk or bedside or anything! Although the box is cardboard and they really aren't rocks, the Mini Zen Garden kit is something lovers of Zen and Gardens will enjoy!"
3,Should have option for hard wire,"The functionality of this device once setup is great. I'm using it for a disposal and hot water dispenser.However, I don't understand why ISE makes this as a plug-in only device. Almost every existing disposal is hardwired to a Romex cord coming out of the wall. In order to use this device in an existing installation, you would need to install a new receptacle from the existing Romex wire and then plug this switch into it.I would prefer the wiring for this device to be like their disposals where you can easily hardwire it or wire in a regular power plug."

1,excellent ear buds...FOR ME TO POOP ON!,"Instead of just griping about the Maxell ear buds' deplorable sound quality, permit me to recommend a superior alternative.""Customers who viewed this"" set of Maxell ear buds would be better off listening to music/podcasts by pressing a stethoscope (check this website for availability) against the outside of any mp3 player.In a side by side comparison:Appearance - Stethoscope winsComfort - Stethoscope againDesign - same as aboveROI/value - give it to the 'scopeAudio quality - STETHOSCOPE, BY A LANDSLIDEBonus suggestion: Have your small children use these awful Maxell ear buds just for listening to music you want them to hate."
1,Save your money,"Worst sounding earbuds I've ever heard! NO Bass and very tinny! The crappy earbuds that come with the Ipod are of much better quality than these things! Seriously, I have bought better sounding headphones at the dollar store! NO LIE! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A BETTER PAIR!"
1,Worthless,"I bought these from a neighborhood Walgreens, and not only the sound sucks, the earbuds are not comfortable. They'll scratch the inside if your ear, you could end up with an ear infection. Either get Sony or Bose, much better sound, earbuds are comfortable, and actually fits in your ear!!"
1,Like putting nails into you ear,"Maxell sent these ear buds to my friend as compensation for a prior product of theirs which had died (though in retrospect it was really doing him a favor)He happily received these buds after a series of heated emails with Maxell about the inferiority of their products, after 5 minutes with the product they sent I can officially determine they were trying to kill him"
4,lp cylinder tank cover,very good fit but very light material that is why a four but it looks great and fits great just hope it will last a while
5,Excellent bottles!,These are great bottles. The drop-in system rules! So easy! An added bonus is that buying them off of Amazon.com is cheaper than two other major retailors I checked locally. The only draw back is you have no control over the color of the bottles. So if you spaz because your son has a purple ring on his bottle then this isn't the best bet for you.
3,Crystalize Your Tongue with David's Pumpkin Seeds!,"I am glad I'm not the only one who thinks this product is ridiculously salty. Never in my life while eating any product, even the saltiest potato chips, have I ever consciously thought ""Wow, this is REALLY salty."" But after consuming just a few handfuls, my tongue and lips literally started to burn due to the high levels of sodium.I realize this is the most popular item in the Trail Mix section on Amazon because it is really tasty, but PLEASE make a reduced sodium version for those of us who still have taste buds not yet etched from our tongues."
2,disappointing,"This was purchased for my daughter, who is an absolute stickler for keeping her cat's litterbox clean. The liners did not sift very well, and the box still had to be cleaned by hand, making the liners useless. I will not be purchasing these again."
4,Work great,"I really like these cat liners. They make cleaning the cat box so much easier. The only reason they do not get a 5 is I wish I could get them in a bigger size. I do have to use several layers because my male cat likes to see how many big holes he can put in them, but honestly I clean my box a lot more often and it is less work on my back."
2,Jan R,"I was very disappointed with this product. After not being able to locate the brand of stiffing cat pan liners that I normally use, I tried this brand. I found that my cats would tear through 4 to 5 sheets of this product between cleanings which means the whole pack would only last for 1 week. The liner sheets are too thin and messy. A pack of higher quality liners will last for at least 1 month."
3,Good size,"This purse is the size and style I wanted.But it is stiff and the handle does not look like leather.If you are thinking of buying this because it looks like a coach purse,it wont fool anyone."
3,Kids who love robots and Star Wars will enjoy it,"My 4-year old daughter fell in love with the Star Wars droids, so she was thrilled to find this movie at our local video store. She thinks it is great! I enjoy watching her reaction."
3,Its pretty good!,Droids was good but the plot is to melo! I think this film should have been more action packed like that ewok one. But the droids make it worth while for me. But two main low points the really scary scene when the droids are in trouble. The other is the uneccissary use of foul language throughout the film. Otherwise its not bad.
4,Book review,"Don't let the fact that this book is entirely in black and white even though the cover is not,deter you. It is well thought out and presented. I think any level of fisherperson can glean some worthwhile information to improve their on-stream skills. Style of writing comfortably presents the details."
4,"Where's Bougie, Bougie???","This is a very good greatest hits showcasing the pips and gladys' work of the 80s. I would have given the cd 5 stars, but Bougie, Bougie should have been included and that would have made it 5 stars for sure, but I still enjoy listening to this cd, especially when cooking and/or cleaning. It still gets you in the mood to move and sang along!"
1,sizing entirely wrong,"I made sure to get the size I need, but this is not even an ex lg. mens size, let alone a 3x. We love the shirt and it is made well."
5,It's Great!,"This is my first camcorder. At this price I had no choice but to finally break down and buy one. The camcorder is small and lightweight. Instructions are simple. After charging the battery I was shooting right away. The picture quality is outstanding, the auto focus works great. The zoom is great too, providing you don't zoom in too fast...it takes a second or two to catch up to you. I love how easily it connects to my TV set for easy viewing on a big screen. I'm getting ready to go on vacation and looking forward to taking some great footage without lugging around something big and heavy."
1,VL-Ah150U,Brand new camcorder has 3 large dots on the screen. Sharp authorized service centers in New York are taking forever to fix it. I am fed up.
4,Good Interpretaion for kids.,"I was happy that there is something available for kids that would introduce them to Shakespeare. However, I still had to use my own words even for narrative. You really can't do much about Shakespeare's words and you would not want to, but the narrative and other explanations should have been made easier to read. They read more like narratives for operas with ""dote"", ""sprite"", ""vowed"", ""disdainful"", ""enarmored"", ""braying"", ""loathsome"" etc all over the place.My kids are under 10 and I was hoping that with my help they will enjoy the book. They did, but I had to really work on it."
4,Wrong Statement,Actually Home Depot sells them for $12.73 for a two pack. You must be thinking of the cheaper ones (there are 4 grades). So this is cheaper but once you put shipping in on top it is about the same unless you buy a lot of them
3,small format book,"if you still didn't decide, which ""book of logos"" to buy for your library collection, this one is a good choice, so FIVE stars to the content. but be careful buying this book (ISBN: 1592532241), even thou it is cheaper for 5$ than a previous edition (ISBN: 1592530877), this one is a ""small format"" book (only 6x6 inches, comparing to 2004 edition, which is a full size book), so i found this book hard to keep open with ""one hand"" ;)"
3,Size does matter,"The larger format of this book, hard or soft cover, deserves 5 stars. This new pocket size (5.5"" x 6"") proves to be awkward and detrimental to the viewing and appreciation of the graphics."
5,"Logolounge series, a must have for Graphic Designers!","I just love the logolounge books, this is the first book of the series and it's not my favorite of them all but it does have a lot of logos that you can browse for inspiration. As a graphic designer I would recommend the logolounge books. Besides the beauty of pages and pages filled with logos it also let's you know the designer or the firm who created the specific logo. Also on the last pages it gives you specific information on each of the firms included in the book first by letting you know on which pages of the book their logos appear on and also by including their website, address, phone numbers etc. I also own logolounge 2 and 3 and will keep buying future series."
5,Good book. Well worth reading.,"I liked this book. It is written in a an everyday conversational style, and it gave me a lot of food for thought. It also provided exercises to help you get examine your spiritual relationship to your evolutionary ancestry."
4,Good read!,Well written and most enjoyable. What a cast of characters! Truth IS stranger than fiction. Good insight into Seattle history.
5,use on all my whites,"this stuff is amazing i buy it a case at a time, I use so much of it.....much better than bleach, better than oxihave never had a problem, people here that have must be using it wrong.....follow the instructions...."
3,ipod,"a good unit but i didn't realize that you cannot copy your ipod music onto another one of your computers.I travel and want my ipod music on my other computer which i cannot do. Also, while the ipod has a category for audio books i cannot store my books there; i have to store them with the music. Audio books are only recorded there when you buy them from Apple on line. Also, Apple is no help if you want to talk to a HUMAN...it's impossible, or if you try to e-mail them with a question."
2,Would have been good,"The quality and creativity of this mp3 player is unsurpassed. However, the navigation is a major pain and it is very difficult to get the player to do what you want when you want with the wheel design. I'd take buttons any day. My wife, on the other hand, loves it but i have noticed that she often appears to have difficulty getting the wheel to behave like she wants it to.Now if they could just get rid of the wheel and add more different kinds of format support I'd be much happier but as it stands, if i hadn't recieved it free it would have been returned."
2,Battery won't last,"I bought an IPod Mini for my son for Christmas 05' and now it is Augustand the battery will not take a full charge. It workedgreat for 7 months and then the battery goes out. C'mon Appleput in a decent battery, I would expect at least a year of usebefore the battery dies. Not cheap to replace either. I own a ArchosAV400 which is more expensive but it blows the ipod away!"
4,IPod Mini Rules!,"I don't know why Apple discontinued the IPod Mini. It is the most durable and best looking IPod. The 4GB version holds 50-75 cd's, and the 6GB version holds at least 100 cd's. For most people, that is plenty of capacity. The sound is superb, especially if you upgrade the headphones. And it's small enough to wear around your neck, like the new IPod Shuffle. I use it with the XtremeMac iPod Mini Accessory Kit (Xtremity for iPod Mini)and a pair of Sony Headphones. I know the new Nano is very popular now, but I think the Mini is better."
3,Apple iPod 4 GB mini,"Sorry, haven't had time to use my iPod. It looks good and came quickley, but I can't give a review until I have more time to use it. Other things have prevented me from working with it."
4,I'm hooked,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday, but couldn't get it to work on Windows ME so I kept it. I download books, magazines, music, podcasts. Bought a charger, car stereo unit, heaven help me. Don't know what I would do without it."
5,"A 'must' for any serious Jewish history collection - and many a general interest holding, as well","The updated, expanded edition of The Last Album: Eyes From The Ashes Of Auschwitz- Birkenau is out, and no less hard-hitting than the original. These black and white photos were not supposed to reach the world: the Nazi order to destroy all personal photos brought to each concentration camp was meant to destroy memories as much as evidence. Despite this mandate, author Weiss uncovered an archive of over 2,400 photos brought to Auschwitz by Jewish deportees across Europe - photos hidden and saved, at great risk to their owners. These photos accompany a traveling exhibition which is making its way around the world, presenting over 400 of these photos and how the deportees arrived at Auschwitz - and how Weiss came to discover them and to research their roots. A 'must' for any serious Jewish history collection - and many a general interest holding, as well."
4,The Characters Come Alive....,"Last month we had a vicious snow storm which dumped 2 feet of snow on Illinois with sub-zero temperature and howling winds. While spending all day scooping snow I kept thinking about early polar explorers. I, like many, had seen the old black and white 50's movie about the Scott party and the PBS series on Scott and Amundsen several years ago. So, I decided to learn more about Robert Scott and ordered the book. I was not disappointed. It was a fascinating character study of the early explorers at the turn of the century. The mental and physical isolation and hardships which Scott and his crew endured is a tale that still haunts me."
5,"Balanced, not by an apologist.","One thing I found interesting about this book was how the author used the experiences of present-day explorers to help explain Scott and party's emotional responses to prolonged contact with each other in difficult conditions. Another example: Scott was fixated on man-hauling, something which the author shows has come back into fashion with the same romantic fervor about it. This brings some balance into a situation in which previous authors have reacted with disproportionate scorn towards Scott's flaws -- Huntsford's dual biography is a classic example, Huntsford is obsessed with putting a (very) negative interpretation on everything Scott did. Explaining Scott and trying to understand him is not being an apologist."
4,Touching,"This is the saddest Kaya book. It shocked me to the point where I just sat and stared at the pages in disbelief. It had an ending that I never expected, and I'm personally not completely sure that I wanted. It made the book more interesting, though. This book is about Kaya's admiration for Swan Circling, who I mentioned in my review of Book 2. But Kaya fears that Swan Circling will not like her if she finds out how irresponsible she truly is. The characters in this book are memorable, and, as in the other books, the art is well-done. Each chapter is rather long, but the book itself is rather short, in my opinion.Overall, I would say this is a good book to continue the Kaya series, and I recommend it to Kaya readers."
4,Kaya's Hero,"This book had a very unexpected ending, one which practically took my breath away. Though not the happiest of endings, it made the book more emotional, and memorable. That's what I like about American Girl, they're not afraid to add a little sadness to their books. I recommend this book to any book-loving girl, although she might enjoy it more if she read the first two books before it."
4,It's fancy enough for company but also great for everyday,"I love this pattern. I did notice that the new silverware I just recently purchased from here felt lighter in the hand than my old stuff that I had gotten approx. 20 years ago, but it's not super noticeable. The pattern is exactly the same and very pretty. I love it. Even being 20 years old you would never guess it. We must've thrown some of the spoons out since I was missing 4 of them and decided to just get a whole new set for 4 people. Amazon shipped it right away and in perfect condition. I highly recommend the pattern as it really looks nice and like I said, is fancy enough for company but just right for everyday too!"
1,Over-Descriptive of Places than it's characters,"This is the only book in my life of 40 yrs did I not complete finishes a book. I have to force myself to read it & had to have great endurance & patience too ! Finally, I had to give up reading at the last 30 pages of the book. The key reason being there's no in-depth plot of the characters. A new character just pop up every few pages & went off site. It's really frustrating thinking there will be some development of the characters but disappointing, none ! Never in my life did I not finish a book as I always respect the author's earnest work but unfortunately for this book, I SIMPLY CAN'T FINISH IT !!! Sad to say............."
4,Power cord Adapter,This adapter with its bright yellow color and flexible cable between the ends fits our needs to a tee. Cost was within acceptable range. Good product.
2,Miserable book,"I could overlook all of its weaknesses that other reviewer's have discussed, but I can't get past the fact that Jenna's life consists of nothing but pain, fear, betrayal, grief, anguish, etc right up to the very last page. The whole point of it seems to be for the author to make the heroine's life as unbearably miserable as possible. For those who like that sort of thing the stories of Stephen R. Donaldson are much better written, on a whole other level."
4,They work but a little uncomfortable,"I bought both the thumb and the finger guard. I find that they really do work quite well, but I find the thumb guard has a stich line that is uncomfortable."
5,Beautiful cookbook for fans of Charley Harper's artwork,I adore old cookbooks. Sometimes it's fun to see the changes in the kitchen technology over time and often it's the dated references to the woman of the house that make me laugh. But this one is a gorgeous page turner because of Charley Harper's artwork throughout. It arrouses a nostalgic affection for the 50's and communicates a distinct feeling on every page. This book is a great addition to any cookbook collection and belongs in every mid century modern home!
1,Not funny,"This joke, and this kind of joke, ceased being funny a long time ago. When does the hatred and contempt stop?"
1,Super Man? Super Bad.,"""The Fog"" has got to be on the top 5 worst movies ever made. It definately makes the short list! The first 20 minutes were borderline interesting, then it just got REALLY BAD. Selma Blaire seemed like she was on something, her voice sounded like she was hagging out, all raspy and lethargic. She even utters a line ""can someone beam me out of here"" and it looked as though she was looking right at the camera. Tom Welling is a one trick pony. You need more than the ""hot"" factor to be a credible and talented actor. He's a horrible crap actor, and they just had to get him with his shirt off, ok! who cares. The minute he opens his mouth you just want to fall asleep. Then the fog rolls in.......WHO CARES! This film is borderline unwatchable, I turned it off half way through because it just didn't interest me. Next!"
5,Great comfortable sweatshirt,"Good weight , full fit , nice to look at basic sweatshirt . Ash color pretty light not as grey like your basic grey ."
4,"So simple, so sweet, so accurate!","I bought this for my boyfriend (now soon-to-be husband) for Valentine's Day 2 years ago. When I stumbled across it and read it I couldn't believe how well it suited the 2 of us down to the smallest detail. We both love the story! The illustrations are irritatingly simple and crappy, but, hey, everybody's got their own style. It's not life-altering, but if you're looking for a sweet love story for 2 jaded people with issues... you'll enjoy this."
1,piece of junk,This iriver T30 mp3 player was a piece of junk! Nothing more to say. What a rip-off!!!
5,Amazing Affordable MP3 Player,"I have this MP3 Player and truly love it. It has the same quality as any IPod that I've ever listened to. The fully adjustable Equalizer Allows you to create just the type of sound you like hearing. I typically like having pretty strong treble my music and it replicates it fantastically! With just a quick browsing of the manual you can easily figure out how to maneuver around the menu like a pro! It does have one minor drawback that was not really a factor for me, but for my sister. I bought her one of these for Xmas and didn't realize that she didn't have Windows XP but 98 SP2 and it simply won't run on it. As I said before, it's not a problem for me though! She'll just need to upgrade to XP and become current with the times!I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive MP3 player. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"
3,Good Value,"This flatware is a good value. Except for the knife, the handles are quite thin, but at this price, it's unrealistic to expect the heft and balance of expensive flatware. The finish has been very durable and this design is classic and simple without being boring. A great starter set for a new homeowner!"
3,"Beware...you are not buying 3, only one","I bought this as a Christmas present, so I can't comment on the fun factor. However, before payment is made, no where does it state that you are only buying 1 of the 3 bikes, not the entire set. This means you have no idea which one you'll get and from what I can tell (since the image is small) I didn't receive any of the three bikes shown. Hopefully my nephew won't care."
1,Pretty Pictures Do Not A Book Make,"A picture book for dreamers. Unfortunately, not much else of substance (e.g., how does the house work and why ?) Avoid this book especially if you have read Country Houses of Sweden. All in all, a poor effort."
5,Nice Late 60's Romance Movie!! A Groovy Little Known Gem!!,"Marlo Thomas stars as an unwed expectant mother with Alan Alda,as a young filmmaker trying to avoid being draft so they marry for convenience at first but the relationship starts to blossom otherwise, in this Groovy 1969 Vietnam Era romance movie.The movie is beautiful,man!!!It should be a cult classic!!!"
5,An Overlooked Classic,"Alan Alda plays a draft dodger who marries pregnant Jenny (Marlo Thomas) to avoid being drafted. Unfortunately he still seems to be more interested in his former friends and party lifestyle than in his new bride. Very funny in places, especially when he meets Jenny's parents. Jenny's father is a dentist and shows off his collection of teeth, which is extremely funny. It's very dry humor. Another great moment is when Jenny, feeling very alone and deserted by her new husband who is partying, goes to a bar. In the bar she meets a geeky creep (a plumbing salesman) who is in town on a business trip and is looking for some company. It's a great scene with the creep doing most of the talking and Jenny just listening. The music in the movie is great; I believe Nilsson sings the title song. Too bad they never did a soundtrack album of this. Charming period piece that never disappoints. It's a light weight romance, which is not everyone's cup of tea."
4,Class Act.,"This exceeded my expectations as I had understood this concert to be one of Diamond's, could it be said - 'failures'. This man doesn't seem to have failures. He did get a bit raucous sometimes, hence my not giving a five star rating. However, he may have been driven by a little over-enthusiasm. I really purchased this to hear him sing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and it was well worth it. I also enjoyed his professional introduction to the song. Good versions of many of the Diamond 'standards' and a strong rendition of ""September Morn"". ""Back in L.A."" is also a beauty. Four and a half stars really."
1,Abysmal Research,"Historical research doesn't get worse than this. I countedover 200 major errors, starting with the cover. McCoyclaims that ""Witta"" is the ancient Irish Gaelic word forWitchcraft. In fact, Gaelic doesn't even have a letter ""w""in it!The rest of the research is on the same level. Most of thebook is generic Neo-Paganism masquerading as ancient""truths"". It contains absolutely *no* accurate informationabout ancient Celtic Paganism.McCoy's etymologies are completely random -- not onlydoes she routinely mistranslate words, she frequentlydoesn't even know what language they come from! Thehistory is almost too abysmal for words, a combination ofout-dated research and pure fantasy. Simply put, this bookis amazingly bad!"
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BOOK","This book is just awful - not only does McCoy bend the facts and make up information, she takes a fine religion like wicca and mucks about with it...and then calles it Witta. I'm surprised that this book is still in print, especially with all the people who dislike it. It is unfortunate that people with an interest in Celtic traditions may stumble across this mis-mash of erroneous statements, terrible research and made-up statements."
2,"Nope, get something else","Now, I enjoyed this book immensely though it is, in my opinion, quite feminist. I always strive for a balance and this appears to be a bit out of balance but if that's your thing you may dig this book.On to the bad stuff... There's absolutely no historical data to back this book up. As near as I can tell it's a total lie. Wicca (or if you choose to disguise it as ""Witta"") is not 1000 years old. It's not even Celtic. It's barely 50 years old and wasn't founded with anything to do with Celts. See my website www.linesofthedragon.com"
1,Pathetic,"Many reviewers have mentioned the fact that Witta isn't even a word in the Irish language as evidence of the author's pathetic attempt at research.My favorite historical blunder is when she states that potatoes were an ancient Goddess symbol for the Irish.I laughed my head off at that one. Potatoes are -not- native to Ireland: they came to Europe with the Conquistadores from their colonization excursions in South America. They were not widely eaten in Europe until the 17th century, because they were considered poisonous. They were not widely planted as a food crop in Ireland until the end of the 17th century, and they did not become a staple food until the 18th century.The 18th century, while it was a long time ago, hardly qualifies as ancient.Oh, and by then, the Irish were all converts to that ""new"" religion, Christianity. Not many Goddesses in Christianity, now, are there? Certainly not ones shaped like potatoes......"
1,"Irish, this is not!","To start off, there is no 'W' in Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge) so attempting to claim this is an ""ancient Irish tradition"" using a word that isn't remotely Irish should give the first clue to the authenticity.Anyone looking for insight into Irish paganism should look to the history and the mythology (Tain Bo Cuailgne and Cath Maige Tured). There is plently of literature about the history and archaeology of Ireland (Pre-Christian Ireland and The History of Ireland). Your best bet would be to stay away from new aged ideas of what Irish celtic culture should have been and stick with what it actually was. One can not base a religious choice on 'shoulds.'"
1,abject nonsense,"As many reviewers have noted, this book is full of historical errors, and outright falsehoods. Some have written that they think such things don't matter in spiritual things, but I'd ask you whether you want to work a religion that is based on innacurate information and ungrounded speculation.If you're looking for Celtic Paganism, this isn't any..."
3,Interesting thoughts on Irish paganism.,"McCoy's book may have been panned throughout the entire ""pagan community"", but this says little about the quality of the book itself. The ""pagan community"" has also treated some newbies poorly because they didn't posess the ""right"" tools, like elaborate alters and ceremonial tools that are far from the origins of paganism. Ms. McCoy's book is a good read for people who are begining to explore Irish religion, but lacks the mythology that makes the religion so special in the first place."
3,Entertaining read.,"Witta doesnt exist this book covers a modern neopagan magical system but I would encourage people to read the book because it has value.Yes the author makes mistakes when she discusses history but this isnt a book about Irish history it is a book on a neopagan system of magic working... thats all. Anyone who goes reading books on neopaganism to learn about history is in the wrong section and their mistake is their own not the authors imo.If youd like to see what the celticism of the 90s is like when combined with neowicca or if youd like to see how secular folk traditions can be combined with modern neopaganism this is an entertaining read for you. There is no ""Ancient Potato Goddess"" mentioned in the book and any celtic reconstructionists that dont like my review are free fly to Ireland for a chat with me about the importance of my cultures heritage."
1,What a piece of ...,"""What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god!""~ William Shakespeare, ""Hamlet"", Act 2 scene 2Thus speaks the greatest of poets. Having seen Jackass Number Two (doubtless in expiation of some hideously appalling crime against humanity committed in a prior lifetime), I can now state definitively that WS never, NEVER saw a Jackass movie."
4,Wow,"I laughed, I vomitted a little in my mouth, and despised myself for laughing so much during this film. Not for the serious, sane, or those easily repulsed. The most insulting aspect of this film is knowing that they make a whole lot more money than I do."
2,Not As Good As Number ONE...,"Here's why:- The bits are less creative, and some (like Bad Granpa), go nowhere.- Bam sounds like he's chewing tobacco for most of the movie. Its really annoying.- Except for one bit (that has a CENSORED bar covering the stunt), Pontius does next to nothing. There three seconds of his defining character, Party Boy, in the closing credits. A waste of talent.- The beard bit goes on FOREVER.- There are some great laughs to be had. Wee Man (!) is the star of this movie. The bit with the fat guy as Phil is hysterical."
5,"New and improved, still too crude for most people.","I started laughing 4 minutes into the movie and never stopped.This is the kind of movie that you will keep talking about.Here are some highlights... suitable for Amazon:Toro Totter - four members of the gang climb on a massive rotating see-saw and try to dodge a bull.Firehose Rodeo - one of the gang tries to hold onto a firehose suspended from a crane, while it is spraying water.Do not watch this movie if you are offended by nudity and drinking."
5,Great safety glasses,"I have been using these glasses for 5+ years as an engineer. I have been through a couple pairs. I have always been partial to metal frame glasses instead of all plastic designs. They tend to last a lot longer. These are by far the most comfortable safety glasses I have ever used, and they look good too."
4,Good safety eyewear.,"I have a big head, and the safety glasses provided at work are uncomfortable. I buy these because the frame is bendable and I can adjust them to fit. My one complaint is that the finish on the inside of the frame wears quickly when exposed to sweat or moisture, causing them to leave marks on your head. Fortunately the are cheap enough to replace every couple months, so this does not become an issue."
2,"Failure, repeatedly","Bought two. One was defective out of the box (three chirps). First Alert mailed me a new one quickly and without questions. The other failed in a month. Again, mailed me a new one. I think they are used to these things failing and are ready to mail new ones out all the time. Didn't have to return the old one, little paperwork. They were then doing ok for a while, but then one failed at a year. The other just failed at three years. The problem is, each time it fails you have to remove the batteries or it keeps chirping. Which means you are without a smoke alarm till you get a new one. Which could be a while. I don't have time for this trouble."
1,Stopped working within 3 months,"Bought and installed one of these in my upstairs hallway.Within 3 months of installation, the alarm began intermittently emitting the ""3 rapid chirps"" alarm, which means that the entire unit is bad and must be replaced. Extremely unreliable!"
4,Chazown your life,"There have been quite a few books recently about finding your passion, and learning to do what you love, but there are not too many that have a God-focused perspective. This Book* talks about finding your passion, not only so you can find fulfillment because following your passion will also help you to accomplish your purpose in this life.You have been put on this earth for a reason. Isn't it time you started accomplishing your purpose? Chazown (pronounced Khaw-Zone) will help you and guide you in this journey.*Waterbrook Multnomah provided a free copy to review"
4,Gerson Diet,"Sorry, I have not read this book yet. I just wanted to let others know that my father-in-law used the Gerson Diet when he was diagnosed with his 2nd round of prostate cancer and was cured or his blood work showed cleared after the diet. Just thought I would add this to the mix. About 10 years after the diet he eventually died from pneumonia not cancer."
3,Note that it requires your USB cable,"Buyer be aware that you have to use your zune usb cable to plug into this wall charger. So, if like me, you want to leave your zune usb cable plugged into your computer (because it's a pain to reconnect later) you'll have to buy another usb cable in order to use this AC wall charger. Again, I am thrilled to have a Zune, but there are so many things that they didn't think through well that maybe Ipods weren't so bad?"
3,Allergy and Dust Lights?,"I'm beginning to wonder if these lights actually serve a purpose or if they're just there for marketing. I know I have some sort of dust or allergy in my apartment, but the only light that ever comes on is ODOR. Do I need to reset it or something ? I've emailed the company and haven't heard back.I also can't run it with the ionizer thing on... it gives me a sore throat. I've done research and this does in fact give people health issues."
5,This book is a wonderful coming of age story.,"A must read for any teenager that would like to get a glimpse into life in the ghetto, and at Brown University. An interesting study in characters and contrasts, the main character is someone you cannot help to care about. You find yourself cheering for him at the end. Get out your hanky, this one will make you cry and laugh."
5,Awesome book,"The book came in just in time for school. It was in great condition, and also an awesome book. Must read"
4,Being Different,"The book A Hope in the Unseen, tells the story of a young blackkid growing up in a low class family of Washington D.C. Cedric LavarJennings has to overcome the struggles of being a teenager in a school where no one cares about going to college. He had to rise above everyone else and make a difference for himself. His dream is to make it big at an Ivy League school. Cedric scored low on his SAT scores which made it hard for him to get into a college. I can relate with Cedric, because I also scored low on my SAT's. Just like Ceric, I had people telling me that I was never going to make it at college. I was afraid of not getting into a college of my choice. Cedric relied on his faith in God to help him believe in himself. He knew that he was going to college and no one was going to tell him otherwise. END"
4,A Hope in the Unseen,"Gripping, wrenching, a clear concise description of growing up poor and black and very very smart."
4,"Excellent Soundtrack, too bad its not all there.","I have th LP version of the soundtrack that has all the extra motown songs on it, unfortunatly the quality is poor. This Cd is a very good representation of the movie, even with the missing songs."
4,Top-notch Who,"This is a highly multi-faceted album, released at the height of Townshend's conceptual jiggery-pokery period. Musically, it has a stunning versitility, and the narrative and story move along a little bit smoother than Tommy. Also of note is the fabulous late-'70s British film based on the album, and it's accompaning sound track, which, if you can find it, contains many different versions of these songs and some outtakes."
1,Waiting for TRUE quality...... an SACD,All the pretty packaging is fine but what I want it incredible sound. And that's not going to happen until they start releasing more music on SACD.CDs are low-fi crap.
5,True Teenage Wasteland...,"I was a young teen when I first bought / listened to THE WHO's QUADROPHENIA. No other collection of songs by any other band ever captured the frustration, anguish, and insanity of my youth. The mood and atmosphere are cold, desolate, and dislocated. Some of the songs (THE REAL ME, DROWNED, etc.) are masterpieces of depressive music. The instrumentation and vocals bring QUADROPHENIA up to a level that THE WHO would never reach again. Listening to it now, I am thankful that it was around when I most needed to hear it. Fantastic stuff..."
5,Best concept album ever,"Some people seem to think that angst in music begun with Nirvana. Never has a purer expression of angst and teen despair been penned than ""The Real Me"". Probably never will be. If you haven't heard Quadrophenia, you've got a massive hole in your musical encyclopedia."
2,Then Original Recording is Better! Warts and All,"The original recording of Quadrophenia was a bit muddy in places. The remastered version seems to downplay Moon's drums and turns up Daltry's and Townsends's performances. I didn't enjoy the remastered version. The original soared and roared. Moon was great on lead drums; John Entwisle simply was the best ever-Bass player. Townsend's lyrics, synthesizers, and guitar make this one of the best ever.I don't understand why they fooled with it. The original was magic. Go find yourself a used copy of the real thing."
1,poor UMG Poor,"the problem of this albums is Universal Music Group. Check versions of some girls, queen and the who. So Poor. So Sad,. compare with beatles, floyd, crimson...."
1,Another money-making scheme from a washed up rock and roller,"The Who do not exist. They died with Keith Moon. Everything else Townsend has released under their name since then has been a cheap imitation culminating with that pathetic Super Bowl performance. When it first came out Quadrophenia was an album that the critics hated - especially Daltry's vocals, but I sort of liked. My main criticism was that there was not enough good material for one album - let alone two. Then after Keith died the Who released The Kids are Alright and the Quadrophenia movie. Of course the movie came with yet another soundtrack. All of the sudden this was classic Who. Now Townsend is looking to cash in one more time by further padding this album with demos? How many times do you go to the well. I'm sure he will want to do a Quadrophenia tour now. Rip off. If you want to hear and see the Who in all of their glory buy the Isle of Wright video from the early 70s'. Skip this."
5,Easily one of their best,"As good as Who's Next and Tommy. This album captures them while they were still at the top of their game in the studio. After this album, they started to slip a little, but were still better than most other groups at the time. I always thought the original album mix was not quite as crisp as it could have been."
5,Another Who's Masterpiece,"This double CD is one of Peter Townshend's (and the Who's) most ambitious projects, concerning identity crisis and the need to belong and be accepted. One doesn't have to be a ""mod"" to understand the complexities of growing up. The music here is also some of the best the Who has ever produced, too (""The Real Me"", ""I'm One"", ""The Punk And The Godfather"", ""5:15"", ""Drowned"", ""Bell Boy"", and ""Love, Reign O'er Me"").This double CD has been remixed and remastered and is sonically superior to all other editions."
5,Astonishing,This is one of The Who's best albums 100 times better than Tommy. If you like an album that has a real story-this is for you. If your intrested in the English/mod scene-this is for you. If your into a truly great CD-this is for YOU.
5,One of those albums...,"I started getting into the Who? when I was about 19 and this is the album I listened to most. I know I'm not the only person to identify with ""Jimmy"" but I sure felt like it at the time. So if you're young and feeling out of place in the world and need an album to put things into perspective for you, this is the one. Think of it as cheap therapy, it worked for me."
4,Teenage Wasteland Opera,"The Who / Quadrophenia (The original recording...no bonus tracks): Being from the States, the first thing we Americans have to overcome is the lack of understanding concerning the whole ""Mods"" verses ""Rockers"" phenomenon that is the basis for this teenage opera. This recording does little to clear things us. However, beyond that, the opera does deal with some basic teenage angst themes that everyone can (or could) relate to. Why grownups would even want to revisit that angst with this opera is another matter (you will have to answer that one for yourself). As to the music, it is very good, if a bit overblown. This is no `Tommy', but still an enjoyable album. Four StarsAs to Version: I suggest you get a CD with the original album and forget all the bonus drudgery. I have the MFSL Gold disk and the sound is very good, but these days that set is very overpriced as used and is Not worth the money being asked for it."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT,I NEVER RECEIVED IT I PURCHASED IT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED NOTHING. I ALSO CONTACTED THE PERSON BUT IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. I AM GOING TO REPORT THIS PERSON. I WANT MY REFUND...
5,Great New Indie Band,"Saw the White Rabbits live after hearing most of their CD. Rare occasion where I enjoyed each equally and immensely. Great Album. IMHO, one of the best of 2007."
3,No ratings for Ms-64/65 grades,"If I'd known the book did not track the higher grades, I would not have bought it."
2,"Works, but fragile","I like the overall idea of the system, and the razor itself works well. However, the base wears quickly. The latch holding down the charging arm breaks in a year or so of use. Given how expensive replacing this is, I'd expect it to last a much longer time. Say, for the average life of the razor itself. Problem is, the latch is made of soft plastic when it should be made of either a hard plastic or a metal. If buying a new razor, go with one that doesn't have a push down arm on the cleaner base."
1,3rd time.....and I'm done,"Yep, the charging handle broke again.....so this would be my third replacement.....I was hoping to see a price drop, considering my razor is now 10 years old. But then again, why would Braun sabotage a perfect system of ripping of the customer. You pay out the nose for a great razor....$200 + when I got mine. Well, I guess since the razor will last forever, Braun will just gauge us $70 a pop from here to eternity. So you're essentially buying a new razor every 6 years, since these things only last about 2 years. From now on, like my grandfather used to do....straight edgde. I'll use the Braun when I travel and clean it manually. Braun can kiss by behind."
1,Save your money,"Don't buy it!!! Solution : I drilled a very small hole in the side of the arm and inserted a small 1/4 nail and it works great. Use a black magic marker, color the nail and you can hardly notice it. Works great Save your $65.00. This is a poorly made item."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, EVER!!!!","I have owned a few different braun electric razors in the last several years. the good news is that the razors are GREAT!!!!!!! the bad news is that on the models with the push down button that holds the razor for cleaning/drying, these units are NOT GOOD AT ALL. well, they are untill they break..... that is the point, they break way too easily. i started buying PANASONIC ELECTRIC RAZORS. they DO NOT HAVE the stupid push down button like braun does. this obviously eliminates the problem of the push down button breaking!!!! some of the newer braun models do not have the push down button. however, they are more expensive. check out PANASONIC ELECTRIC RAZORS. they are awesome!!!"
2,okay product,it is okay...just it was not contained to brew. But I did buy it as loose tea. I do use it occasionally.
2,misrepresented display,"This clock radio is shown with a black background with blue numbering. The actual item has a bright blue background with small black numbering. The blue lighting is so bright that I could not make out the numbers from the otherside of the bed. My wife likes a night light but this was even to bright for her and had to block the clock radio to sleep. We like the temperature and projection features of this radio. The setting of the alarms were somewhat difficult. Even after we unplugged it and had the alarms turned off it would go off at a previous set time. I finally had to take the back-up batteries out to silence it. We replaced this item with an Emerson projection clock radio, it has large red lettering that isn't bright at all and very easy to read even across the room."
3,"Good product, but Aux Input needs more juice","The main reason I bought this clock was for the MP3 input jack so you can plug in your mp3 player or Ipod into it and set the alarm to whatever music you like or to just listen via the clock's speaker. That all works, except that the sound is about impossible to hear even though the volume is turned all the way up. I liked all the other features like the outdoor and indoor temperature, projection, dual alarms, and radio, so I kept it. Your mp3 or whatever external device will need some type of ampliphier in order to hear it though the clock speaker, other wise the Aux input jack is useless."
3,Revival from the 80's,I remember liking more of the songs on this album when I originally got it way back when. I guess my tastes have changed since then ... I will have to take a listen again just to be sure. But the product itself was in perfect condition ... so no problem there.
5,Classic - in the very best sense of the word!,"Ten years after its release, ""Diesel & Dust"" has held up well. For those of us for whom this album as a soundtrack to our lives in 1988, each listen brings back memories and yet still very much exists in the present, with the message of each song still powerful and relevant today.It still remains a mystery how such a dead-on song like ""Beds Are Burning"" managed to climb into the top 20 on the US singles chart, but the world is a better place for it. Such a shame that such could not happen today.If you are bothering to read the reviews posted here, you are interested in this album. If you don't have it, what are you waiting for. WAIT NO MORE!!!!!!!"
3,Great Content But...,"The program itself is excellent and I found myself watching the entire trailer collection in one sitting. Quality better than expected also. However, Passport (a company I have never liked) has not the company name but the DVD title ""Destination Earth: Alien Invaders"" superimposed in the lower right hand corner during the entire program. For many this is a deal breaker and lowered my rating by one star. The extra content is lame but the trailers are entertaining..probably more than the movies themselves were."
2,Nice GPS but the maps are kind of old,"I got this in June and it has been really helpful; gives good directions. Some of the features you have to pay more to use, and they don't tell you that.The most annoying is that the maps are from last May and they won't be updated until November next year. So if you live or travel where there are new or changed roads, be prepared to watch your Nuvi show you are driving through the fields !! Also, the map updates will cost about $[...]."
2,The Portrait Book,This book is not exactly what I expected. Firstly it deals exclusively with film cameras. This book also deals primarily with how to open a studio and run a photography business.
2,Pararid/sweep or not?,"OK, I just don't like the strog herbs in Pararid--yah, it might do the trick, but you can also just take the herb thyme and make tea out of it. That also gets rid of parasites for those who need something more gentle.Now, the Parasweep it agreed with me fine and I plan to finish the bottle because sometimes constipation happens and it helps to have this for that. So, if you can stomach strong herbs then this product should work for you. I just don't recommend it for people that are sensitive to them."
4,Excellent historical novel,This second book in a trilogy is so good because of the quality historical elements.
3,clothespins,"I don't mean to naysay. The group is good; as instrumentalists, they are top notch. ""Marty's Kitchen"" is an amazing piece of virtuosity. Their two guest guitarists (Bryan Sutton and Pat Flynn) are in some ways the highlight of the album--they play as beautifully as Tony Rice, with a lot more inventiveness. And the songs are pleasant enough, if lacking in lyrical depth and interest.But Carol Young's voice is unpleasant; she sounds like she's wearing a clothespin on her nose. She has little vocal range, and the reedy, nasal quality of her singing is really a drawback. Indeed, there isn't much good singing on the disc. In that, they are most reminiscent of Nickel Creek: great musicians, indifferent singers, and decent but not overly memorable songs. A mixed bag. Which is too bad--because they are wonderfully talented. They should import some decent singers and hire some better songwriters."
5,fabulous romantic suspense,"Six years ago in Split Creek, Texas, an unknown assailant killed SandyPowers, fiancee of the current Police Chief Jared Morgan. The murderer was never apprehended. Now, a message on the local high school wall announces that the killer is back.LOST is a fabulous romantic suspense with the emphasis on suspense. The thrilling story line never eases on the throttle as two major subplots tie back into the prime tale. The lead characters are a charming duo and many readers will empathize with Michaele's plight. With novels like this one, COME SUNDOWN and MORE THAN YOU KNOW, Helen R. Myers deservedly becoming a fan favorite."
2,Similes,"Lost had an interesting plot--full of suspects, twists, and turns. However, the two main characters, Michaele and Jared, were underdeveloped. The minor characters were much more interesting. As for the steamy love scenes, they're all alike from book to book. However, my main complaint about this book and author was the ridiculous similes occurring on every page. They were contrived and wordy. The only reason I finished the book was to find out ""who done it""."
3,Did I read the same book?,"Being on spring break, I only have so much time to read and I want to read the best in what time I have. I read the reveiws on this book and though, ""Oh wow, this has to be a great book!"" That isn't how I would characterize this book. It's not bad, but frankly, it's not that great. The plot goes something like this: Six years ago a young woman was brutally killed in her home. Flash to the present, another young woman disappears and a message is left on the school's walls ""I'm back! 666."" Sounds good. The book doesn't play up on this to the point that I'm fascinated with the suspense. The heroine did have a different twist with her occupation and dysfunctional family. All in all, this book is ok but it's nothing to get excited over."
3,It's okay?,"Everyone raves about Jullian. Most of her DVD's are great. This one is okay. I am a very symmetrical person. I like to do the same exercise and reps on both sides of my body - especially with arms and legs. This video confused me. She tells you that you are going to do repeat a sequence 2 times in the 20 minutes workout. The first 20 minute workout was correct, but the next two are all over the place. She does one side of the body, but not the other and then she does it again in the next 20 minutes. Not sure if she repeats the other side in the other 20 minutes or not. Just got confused. I have been doing kickboxking for years, so it's not because I am not familiar with kickboxing. She either forgets her sequence or she is doing something that I haven't caught on to. I am going to continue to do the DVD, but with a lot more awareness."
3,So not my favorite Jillian,"I love, love Jillian workouts. This one not so much. I don't like the pace, the workout or anything about it really. I was really hoping for more of a kickboxing type of workout but while it does some kickboxing moves, it's not really all kickboxing. I like her other workouts much better. I would not recommend this one."
5,Love this!,"Been doing Jillian DVD's since November of 2012 lost 26 pounds so far. This is another one to add to the collection though. It's a nice workout, not as intense as I would like, I felt like I had a lot of energy afterwards usually with Jillian I'm about to fall over. I did workout #1 though. Maybe the other ones will be harder. It was VERY fun though, I like the pace, she goes right into each move. I DID sweat a lot! Feels good! Just wish it was longer than 20 minutes. This is a good workout though, something great if you're fitting your workout in between things."
3,It's not bad for 20 mins,"I wouldn't spend a whole lot on this video, but I like the 20 minute aspect. I think that Chrus Freytag's Cardio ickboxing video that is a part of the XTreme 10 Pound Silmdown is more effective."
2,"Eh, Jillian has better workouts","I got this with instant on amazon, so they did not think a tutorial was needed I suppose. Personally, I find it very hard to follow along as it moves very fast and doesn't provide much time to get the moves down. I've done this workout twice now, 1 and 2 back to back, (20 mins is NOT enough!) but I think I'll stick with rotating other Jillian videos."
2,Too Fast,"I bought this DVD to try to add a little variety to my workouts. I have done kickboxing DVDs before and was excited that Jillian had one too. I guess the title says it all and I should have been more aware that ""Fast fix"" meant fast paced! The tutorial section is great, but I like it better when Jillian gives instruction while she is working out, not in a separate section. I had a really hard time remembering the correct positioning and trying to keep pace with the group. The transition from move to move was way too fast for me! This is not one of my favorites."
2,Disappointment,I love Jillian but this was not her best! For the 2nd workout she only does it on one side!!! I bought this on a whim & wish i read the reviews first. It gets you sweating but it's jus not balanced! Her ripped in 30 is soo much better!
1,All the negative reviews you read about this product (and its predecessor) are true,"After researching wireless FM transmitters to use with the Zune in my car, I had serious doubts about all the negative feedback that these Monster units received. So I bought this unit from Amazon to try it out for myself.The negative reviews are true-- static interference even on the clearest channels. The sound quality is awful given what this thing costs. The product feels and looks cheap as well. Not to mention, the clearest channel I could find for the use of this product was 87.9 MHz, but the channel memory on this unit doesn't go any lower than 88.1 MHz! Ridiculous.Believe the reviews. Don't waste your time or your money on this unit. After testing it out for about an hour, I had mine packaged and ready to return to Amazon for a refund.(Brand new CD decks with front auxiliary input are available for as much as this unit. Might as well just upgrade your deck)"
2,Too Much Static,"I purchased this product for my 16 GB Zune with high expectations since many of the Monster FM transmitters received favourable reviews. However, I was a a bit disappointed. There is constantly fluctuating static in the background. I assume this is due to the fact that the device carries an electrical current to charge the Zune while transmitting simultaneously. It seems that the underlying electrical current interferes with the FM transmission. This is very noticeable with music and especially with podcasts. Now, I use an Aerielle i2i Universal FM Transmitter which provides perfect, static-free reception of my Zune"
5,GREAT VALUE!!,"These are wonderful cards, high quality and very well worth the price. Just check the price of cards, even at the discount stores. Thank you for providing a tasteful, quality product at a reasonable price!! I love sending cards, but it gets expensive! Not with these options."
3,Eventually An O.K. Mystery,"I say eventually because this book is way, way too long. The plot is not that complex, but somehow Tursten manages to get lost in minutiae and turn this cozy little family mystery into a behemoth of boredom.The translation is superb, and little problems of flow are handled extremely well. The characterization is a little simplistic, and it is not very realistic to suppose that, even in socialized Sweden, Mr. Huss will be happy cleaning house and being second fiddle to his absent wife.This particular plot and set of characters, even in a pared down form, could at best have been given four stars. But due to all the meanderings into DI Huss' boss' blood pressure problems (for example), I was just relieved to reach the end of this journey through the Sahara. When key plot details are finally revealed and resolved, the reader is just too numb to find them thrilling. I doubt I'll try another...."
2,"Here's a mystery, how did this get published?","I purchased this book after a glowing review on NPR. Big mistake. Perhaps it is the translation, but there are, no joke, 2 or 3 exclamation marks per page! The writing is stilted and filled with stereotypes. The central mystery lacks any major surprises and Tursten even fails to capture the omnipresent chill of a Swedish winter. If you want to try some international crime fiction, try the excellent 'Shape of Water' by Camilleri or 'A Very Long Engagement' by Japrisot."
1,If you are thinking about buying this book - don't!,Strozer offers no new insights - most of what she says has been argued elsewhere more convincingly. Her style is rambling and unappealing. If you are looking for an informative text about language acquisition after puberty I would advise you to turn to a different source.
2,Bought for my Houdini,"My dog, easily broke from wire cages. I bought this in anticipation he would stay in with the lock. A no go-he got out in minutes. I guess he uses his body weight to pop it open."
3,Vari Kennel Door dial latch does not last,"I bought the PetMate Vari Kennel Giant size in 2011. This model has a ""dial"" door latch that extends and retracts four pins to secure the door. This closure is not sturdy enough to last long when opened and closed several times every day as we do. Eventually the dial will start to rotate too far and the pins will all fall out of their guides. Putting them back is a pain. Replacement doors are sold separately ($25 to $30), probably because they are not very sturdy in the first place. So expect to eventually need a replacement door if you use it frequently."
2,Disappointing,"We've had a lot of plastic crates over the years and this one is one of the worst. It does not have ventilation in the back as shown in the picture. It also has a new turning type door closure that I don't care for - also not shown in the picture. The way this new door is installed, it narrows the crate entrance by at least 25-30%. The measurements list it as 48"" long, but the interior floor where the dog lays is just under 40""! Would not buy this crate again, but it's size and weight make it difficult to return. This was an expensive mistake."
5,Used to ship a macaw,I bought this to ship (airline) my Greenwinged Macaw. I screwed a perch through the side and she fit great. She arrived across the country safely. The crate held up great.
3,"Small Kennel has no holes on rear, unit is NOT IATA compliant.","Should have air vents on all sides, there were none on the rear. I have the medium size cage that DOES have holes in the rear, customers should note that the small kennel does NOT have holes in the rear, and that makes it NOT IATA compliant.Due to the lack of time I have I have had to drill holes on the rear face to be able to transport my cat internationally."
3,Vari Kennel medium,"I have the vari kennel model 100 or small and am so dissapointed the company has decided to stop making the traditional vari kennel in the size 100. They do still offer the model 100 in plain cream color but why are none of the new ones made in the size 100 anymore? I liked the shorter length but wider opening of the vari kennel over the other all plastic kennels as getting a pet out of it was so much easier, and the 28"" long would be really quite huge for a cat! The 100 is perfect for a large cat I wish they would make them in colors and without the big lug things on top and the floor the unsmooth floor of the traditional model is not the most comfortable for the pet. As for quality the vari kennel is tops and the finest around."
2,Petmate Vari Knnel,"The kennel came broken in the edges where the screws go. It is very difficult for me to return it, but i wanted it to let you know so you can better monitor future shipments,"
3,"A little more variety, please.","I was introduced to Caedmon's call two years ago when I saw them in concert with Jars of Clay. I was hooked! I got Chronicles because I only had the 40 Acres CD and wanted a sampling of their earlier work. I was a little disappointed when I found that six out of seventeen songs were from the 40 Acres CD. And most of the older songs they chose to put on this CD were ""new studio recordings"", which I didn't like as well as the originals. Although I still love their sound and message, I would have liked to see a little more variety in song choices for this album. I would recommend that you buy the individual albums instead of Chronicles. Plus, there are some other great songs that you will miss if you pass up their other albums!"
3,Hot and cold,"This long-time fan finds LAP OF LUXURY among the least impressive of Cheap Trick's albums. The CD runs hot and cold, the former being songs written by Rick Nielsen, the latter songs not by Nielsen. In other words, program LAP OF LUXURY for ""Let Go,"" ""Ghost Town,"" ""Wrong Side of Love"" and ""All We Need Is A Dream."" Cheap Trick's best includes ONE ON ONE, STANDING ON THE EDGE, AT BUDOKAN, and their self-titled debut album."
5,I Love This Disc!,"This is an excellent disc. I have a lot of Dylan discs, and while this isn't the best, it sure is great. It's an essential part of any collection, not just a Dylan fan's."
3,Grovvin' with Bob,"Strange collection of songs. Plenty of rockers like ""Ugliest Girl in the World"", ""Silvio"", ""Dream About You Baby"". The dirge-like ""Death Is Not the End"", featuring rap band Full Force on vocals and some of Bob's best harmonica playing in awhile, and ""When Did You Leave Heaven?"" are prefect melancoly reflection. The vocal arrangements on ""Ninety Miles an Hour (Down a Dead End Street)"" are reminicent of classic gospel, country. And of course, only Dylan can interpret a classic like ""Shenendoah"" and make it sound brand new."
1,An abysmal beacon of boredom!,"Forget valium, Sominex, nyquil or any other chemical tranquilizer. All you need to fall asleep because it's so darned dull and lackluster is the album ""Down In The Groove"" by Bobby Dylan."
1,Down In The Dung!,How dare Bob Dylan take my money for this disaster. Don't this again to me Bob. Please dont!
1,"Down On The Lack Of Groove, you mean.","It's ironic that an album with such a hip title, could be so unhip. Bob's great, but this album is a disappointment."
1,I Hate This Disc!!!!,"One of Dylan's supremely overrated cds. I bought it, listened to it once and gave it back. ""Sally Sue Brown"" and ""Let's Stick Together"" are jokes. His version of the Stanley Brothers classic ""Rank Stranger"" ain't worth trouble. Just awful"
3,Don't Judge the Man too Harshly,"Most people who purchase this CD are die-hard Dylan fans who've already bought all the really good albums and are timidly sampling what's left. ""Down in the Groove"" is not the stinker it's been made out to be. I bought it for Senandoah and Rank Strangers, and to me it's worth it just for those two songs. The rest aren't bad. But face it, if you're a die-hard Dylan fan you're going to get around to buying this someday, and it's not the piece of garbage that's been reported. Just average. But Dylan on an average day is better than most anyone else at their best. And if you're a fan I don't have to tell you that."
1,I'd rather listen to 12 hours of non-stop Barry Manilow,Than this terrifically bad album by an artist who obviously was in a state of decline when he recorded it.
1,Essentially a failure.,"Like it's predecessor ""Knocked Out Loaded"", this album fails to hit the mark. Full of what are essentially throw-away songs in which Dylan sounds uninspired and going-through-the-motions. This album is an essential failure."
4,Easy Listening,Considered not one of Dylan's better albums yet I quite like it. The album has a good variety of differing catchy tunes and is easy listening to relax to.Enjoyed the messages in the songs as well.
1,Bad album mates!!!!,"Hello mates! I'm a Bob fan from down under. Austrailia mates! I spend a lot of time in the outback, and I've seen plenty of crocs from up close. Before I throw a prawn on the barbie I play any other disc on the old player than this one, I hated it. I drink a cool Foster's and forget about the heat. Bob sure is usually great, but not on this mess."
1,Oh Bob???,"Sometimes one wonders why Dylan can't be just a little more selective (okay, a lot more selective) with his recorded material. If he were, ""Down In The Groove"" could have been prevented. If there's anything good that came out of this recording, it's that it amplifies what Dylan can do when he's on his game (as he was with the following ""Oh Mercy""). A good portion of ""Down in the Groove"" doesn't sound like Dylan because it's not. Only four songs were written or co-written by Dylan. Since his songwriting is one of his strengths; that's a shame. Instead, we're treated to mostly nasal covers of folk and gospel. Skip this one."
4,good stuff,"I did not actually read this book, but listened to it in audio-book format during a drive to D.C. I enjoyed it so much, I listened to it again soon after. Markoe delivers laugh-out-loud commentary while still being smart, articulate and witty. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the finer (annoying) things in life. Markoe narrates the audio-book, which gives you an even better feel for Markoe's personality."
4,"They call Vern ""The Voice."" Here's why.","""Set 'Em Up Joe"" (a honky-tonker about a man wearing out an Ernest Tubb 45 -- remember them?) was the hit, and sounded just right coming out of a jukebox at 1:00 AM. But the prime cut here is ""Chiseled In Stone,"" which to my mind rivals Jones's ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" as the most heart-breaking recording of all time. In between there's lots of filler, but Vern Gosdin's filler beats out just about anything you're likely to hear on country radio in these benighted times. Stone country -- snap it up while it's still in print."
5,Amazing Midland quality.,"Stop researching already and buy these now. Great quality and Great brand well known Midland. I bought these because I'm in the Security field, an executive protection agent aka(body guard). These work great for traveling in my line of work. They are comfortable for 12 hour security shifts. Five stars all around. Remember microphone is not meant to be worn on sleeve of shirt but by your chest area. To clarify earlier comments. Love the quality for the price Midland put on these."
4,Pretty nice headsets!,I use these headsets backstage at my local theater. They work great in quiet conditions. The only complaint I may have is that it's a bit confusing figuring out how to wear them most efficiently and without cables dangling around my neck.
5,Don't leave Amazon without 'em!,These are essential to using our radios in a noisy environment. Takes the Midland radios we paired these with out of the toy category.
4,Really good,This product is really good if you have any radios it is worth getting these headsets because all the audio output is so clear I work as a door supervisor in a club and it's difficult to hear what is being said but for some reason this product helps a lot better than some headsets I have had in the past!!!!
5,Secret Agent Man!!!,"We use these with our Midland radios for the security team we have at our business. The security team are never more than 200ft away from each other and through three floors of building. They are well constructed, lightweight and unobtrusive. The team loves them over the old ones we had where they looked like Britney Spears in a concert (boom mic, etc). Now they can be like Secret Service and can watch our patrons in a bit of cognito. They are well worth the money and we plan to buy more for the other radios."
4,Great,"No problems - it works as expected. Ear buds fit inside the ear canal and allows me to hear perfectly fine. Only gripe is that there isn't a volume control on the headset, as sometimes I think it's too loud even after I've lowered the volume setting on my radio."
2,Mics do not work well,"These headset do not work well unless you are speaking into the mic at normal volume. I bought a cheap set on Ebay that work great even if I barely whisper. With these, if you whisper you can only be heard on the other radio if it is turned up full blast and the listener is concentrating and expecting you to say something. If you do not need to speak quietly I suppose these will work fine."
3,Low expectation for specific use,"I puchased this set thinking it may work for use in a racecar and fit comfortably under a helmet. The headset fits fine and works, but the volume output is too low to make it usefull for what I needed it for. The push-to-talk switch is also difficult to use, but again, my intention was to use it in a racecar. I'm sure the set works great for what it was actually intended. Not good for a loud racecar. Too bad, because it fit very well under a helmet."
3,Spader Speaks Koontz,The Strange Highways Collection is not my favorite Koontz book. What saved this audio version was Spader's deep throaty reading.Spader's voice commanded me to pay attention.Movie Taster
5,"evil, murder, monsters, and a little romance","Koontz has done it again. His stories are ablt to send you running for the streets if not send you into pschic shock from the stories becoming too real for you. He puts you on the edge of your seat and throws you back. Koontz is able to write to and for hi audiance and also for people who have never read him before. He knows what the people need and how to get every aspecxt of fiction into one story. He has the evil incarnate, monsters with pumkin heads, aliens from space, men from parallel universeses, and even romance. Koontz's stories and novels are by far more outstanding than 98% of all other authors. He gives stephen King a run for his money. If you like King you will love Koontz."
4,Some really great stuff.,"This is a collection of stories that will make you laugh, cry , or be so scare that you lose control of your bodily functions (don't worry it happens to all of us at one time or another). Some of these stories flat out kick. For instance, ""Strange Highways"" and ""Chase"" were both hard to put down. However there are also some very poor stories as is the case in most such collections. Over all though, I would say it is most definitely worth reading"
3,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"THE LABEL SAID COLONIAL BOSTON ,BUT SOMEBODY MUST HAVE SWITCHED THE CONTENTS,HOWEVER THE DESIGN IS OK AND WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH IT!STILL A GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this set and the teaspoon set, to go with the 53 piece of the Oneida s/s flatware. The flatware was a nice heavy stainless flatware. This set and the teaspoon set is lightweight and not the 18/10 stainless like the 53 piece."
2,Not satisfied,"Overall, the cable does it job, but the constant sound drops/pops you hear while listening to music is irritating. I know none of you wouldn't want to be listening to music then all of a sudden you hear a small disturbance in your music. It's just really irritating because it doesn't stop. These cables look like Belkin replicas so be careful when purchasing them."
1,"Wow, this is bad","Don't sit through this movie, it's much more barable to sit through with Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Anyone agree? This is like the film the matrix ripped off, but guess what the matrix was good, this one totally sux! This is not a ""movie"" (I use that term lightly) for anyone human being to see. Eraserhead was easier to follow than this. Boring, stale, and lame. The only highlight of the film was seeing glimpses of casablanca. That's a great move, show a really great movie in your terrible movie. A man refusing to submit to the mindless monotony of his world punches up endless re-runs of ""Casablanca"" on his video display terminal until, in a strange mechanical mix-up, his identity and Rick Blaine's become fused within Novacorp's computer bank. Now, what was just a flickering fiction on his screen, becomes a reality. Yet another entry in the bizarre ""people getting lost inside computers"" genre. This one isn't even coherent. See the MST3K version instead, it's much better!"
1,Bankrupt at the Mind Bank.,"Who could imagine that PBS would sponsor such tripe? The script had to have originated in the mind of a high schooler: the plot is plotting, the acting aching and the production values nearly worthless. That Raul (a Puerto Rican-born actor whose character's name sounds Jewish and whose mother looks Scandinavian) would stoop to being in this futuristic soap opera cum sci-fi braindrainer is a sad commentary on his ability to choose a script. However, the concept is a good one. Buy Total Recall instead."
5,Just what I needed,I find that ink using HP original cartridges for my HP printer makes a big difference. I tried refill cartridges in the past and found they don't last anywhere near as long. I am very pleased with the originals and would recommend them.
1,Color ink cartridge was did not work.,"After installing ink cartridges, printer did test page and everything look ok. When I went to use the printer next day, the color would not work and I had already trashed the packaging. Will not buy anymore ink cartridges online."
5,Good Product,This is what I need for my HP printer. The price is less at Amazon than at HP. That's the main reason I get it from Amazon.
5,Monopoly,I love this series but these sellers monoplies on the fact that there are not a lot of dvd avaible. Its trully asame that they all have to put there prices so high! Some are even over 100 dollars what the heck!
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"The actual facts regarding the layout of the cathedral are total fantacy.A little research as done by De Mille for his book -Cathedral, would have been nice .The story was also total fantasy.I expected better but it it looks like burnout has set in."
2,BIG disappointment,"Another hero who's wife dies a tragic death, do I see a pattern here?,leaving him with a housefull of children, this time 10.....oh please.I found the bad guys in this book more interesting than Patterson's new hero."
1,Could't even finish it!,"I usually devour James Patterson books and I particularly like his collaborations with other authors. Tried as I might, I could not finish this book. I can usually finish his books in a day or two...I would read three pages and have to stop. I got to somewhere in the 200s and decided it's just not worth it. Huge disappointment...but I do recommend The Quickie and You've Been Warned."
2,George Carlin would puke!,"I have been a big fan of Patterson. I even like his flying kids. This book is way below his standards.1. The hard core characters say ""friggin"". One of things I liked most about Patterson was his real dialogue. This book reads like he's trying to sell to a fundamentalist junior high crowd.2. The main character is a fallen devout Catholic, who is angry at his Irish qrandfather, a priest. His wife is dying of cancer and he has 10 adapted children of every race.3. His villains are the strength of this book. The plot is decent and the bad characters are real, except for the ""friggin"" speech. The plot saves this work from a ""one star"".Patterson is better than this. I hope this is not a sign of deterioration with age."
1,What Has Happened to James Patterson???,"Ever since James Patterson has teamed up with co-authors, his books have been on a down-slide. This book is just plain boring - entirely too many characters. What does ten kids, a dying wife, a nanny, and an Irish priest/grandfather have to do with the plot?? I waded through this book, and am reticent to read any more of Patterson's books. The last few have been disappointing. He is no longer a best seller."
5,Step on a Crack 10/07,Another outstanding book from Patterson. You CANNOT put the book down when you start reading it....Trust me!!!! I read the book within 48hrs. Ha! Ha!
5,Could not put this book down,I really enjoyed this book. Excellent fast moving plot. It is not like Alex Cross or Women's Detective Club a different style for James Patterson.
3,Kind of confusing and over-dramatic at times,This was the first time reading a James Patterson book for me. It was alright but at times there was too much drama and confusion. I didn't like how a whole scene was just skipped with the hostages were released and the bad guys got away. Still don't know exactly what happened but it could turn into an action and suspense movie.
5,Excellent Excellent Excellent!,I could not put the book down period! It was suspenful exciting and you never expected what was going to happen!
2,Dissapointing ending,"I'm generally a fan of Patterson, but I found this novel sadly disappointing. For one, I couldn't help but draw parallels with a Nelson DeMille novel which follows a very similar premise. More significantly, I felt like Detective Benett's actual role in the events of the novel is minimal, particularly in regards to the conclusion. It seemed like a lot of time was spent on scenes involving his dying wife and kids, but, while I felt bad for him, it didn't endear me to the novel or Benett as a character.There was enough in the story to keep me reading to the end, but the climax was a major let-down. The way the case is eventually solved has literally nothing to do with Benett's detective work. A much larger roll is placed by happenstance, and the ending felt tacked on, like the authors just picked the easiest segway into a dull final reveal. Hopefully with his wife out of the way the Benett novels can trend up from here."
5,"Although Lite Reading, an EXCELLENT story","It's discouraging to see people not liking this book. The hostage scene was incredible, the action plenty to keep a person moving forward, and between the Irish humor and the heart the writers showed when writing the main character's family story, I just couldn't lay it down."
4,Great read,"Loved the characters and the relationships being developed among them. In addition to the action and intensity of the bad guys, the Bennett family situation really pulled at the heart strings."
4,More of the series,I don't know what more to say about the series. I have them all. I love them all. They are a great read. Get them in order.
4,Good read,"A quick read. Bennett is a good new character for Patterson. Can't wait to read the other Bennett novels. Good, but not great."
5,loved this book. Quick Read. Page Turner.,I loved this book. Could not put it down.the characters were just like today's hollywood.
5,A new character,I thoroughly enjoyed this book...another nail-biter...about a real man who exists as a healthy person amidst a terrible situation and displays great love for his family.
1,Almost unbearably formulaic,"Fans of James Patterson, beware! I love his earlier novels, but this was a bad imitation. It seemed to me as if Patterson himself had probably developed the character and outlined the plot and then had his co-author do the actual writing.Whatever the process, it was mind-numbingly bad. Chapters of just a couple of pages for those with flickering attention spans. Unbelievably simplistic, cliched writing. It was like Patterson badly reproduced by a computer program -- formulaic, cliched and an utter waste of time and money."
4,Loved it!,"I did not read the book, but instead listened to the audio book version.I must say I loved it. The plot may be a little weak, but I fell hard for Mike Bennetts character. I hope there will be more books in the works with him as the lead. He is my kind of hero.Write on,Petra LozanoAuthor2UBooks.ning.com"
1,Unable to suspend disbelief,"This read like a late book review completed to avoid an ""Incomplete"" in a compulsory English class; there must have been a deadline from the publisher to keep the advance. I found the Women's Murder Club mysteries entertaining, but this was popular writing for hire -- a reputation for sale to an aspiring co-writer. The plot reminded me of the incredibly weak ""Armageddon"" movie from 1998 with Bruce Willis, because I was also unable to suspend disbelief for that project; throughout the book, I reacted with ""Come On!"" Maybe it's time for me to give up on Patterson."
1,So bad!,"As good as Patterson's early books were, this is the worst. I read at least a mystery a week. There are no redeeming qualities to this book. The characterizations are grade school level, the side remarks of the characters are so pathetic. I don't begrudge him selling out his rep by using unknown authors.......in fact good for them. But this is drivel. How unfortunate for persons who are drawn to him by his ""Best Seller"" history."
2,Step On A Crack,"I used to enjoy coasting with Patterson's novels. This one, even with a collaborator, just didn't create much excitement for me. Parhaps it was because it followed Patterson's old tried-and-true patterns. At any rate, it's not a too-unpleasant way to spend a weekend beside the fire."
4,wonderful gift for the clueless,"after my sister got this I got to read it and it is the ultimate beginners cookbook for anyone on a budget or anyone wanting to learn how to cook who has no experience in the kitchen, wonderful for dorm/minimalist cooking or cooking for a small group."
1,Bad Service,"The show is great if I could get the product. 34 days and counting, order not received, refund not given, Amazon has not responded to the claim."
4,Interesting Results.,"A friend recommended this to me when she learned I was trying to get pregnant. She had it recommended by her family in Mexico, took 1/4 bottle, and got pregnant that month. It tastes like compost tea mixed with alcohol, in a fruity kind of way... but if you down it in a shot glass and drink water for a chaser, it's not that horrible. For me, this did improve my menstruation symptoms - I didn't notice much cramping, and my period only lasted 3 days instead of four with no extra spotting afterwards, which I had gotten used to in the last six cycles or so. That suprised me. As far as pregnancy, I'll have to wait and see. I only took one 16oz bottle last month and have not purchased a second one yet."
3,not working yet,Ive been taking Lydia Pinkham now for almost 2 weeks and nothing yet. I have had problems conceiving or even having a normal cycle for as long as I can remember and after reading reviews I decided to try this product. Im not saying it doesnt work but Im saying its not working yet so im getting skeptical. If anyone has any idea how long i have to take this before my cycle gets normal can you let me know. Thanks
2,"A nice idea, but its time has passed","I do like the idea of a book that approaches webcasting in the same way that one would approach short-wave radio, and in 1998 perhaps that approach made sense. But now, in the year 2000, it seems a bit quaint and unnecessary, like a 1995 Internet how-to book.Instead of purchasing this book, I would suggest popping over to Broadcast.com. Browse the wide variety of content there, and consult the Help pages for assistance with installing media players. Sites like Yahoo Broadcast, RealGuide, and WindowsMedia.com provide more than enough introductory material for the novice, and countless media streams to choose from."
3,Interesting but not much practical help,"I purchased this book hoping to get some help with my 7 year old son... He has suddenly developed fear of a number of things and I wanted some ideas of how to help him cope... This book was interesting, but it didn't really give me any specific ideas on how to help my son, which was what I really wanted.."
3,Starts simple and stays simple,"This is a good starter book as it claims to be.. but as I leafed through it I realized that anyone who has had even some remote experience with origami or paper crafts will find this book ... perhaps too basic.I was hoping for at least a couple of more 'exciting' or slightly advanced projects at the end of the book, but the book stays simple till the end. Also, paper with both coloured sides looks better even for some of the basic designs.Other than that, it offers exactly what it says on the cover."
2,Difficult to use,This is called Easy Origami but my granddaughter and I found the instructions difficult to follow.
5,A Wonderful Book!,"I found that, not only was Ms. Schenone's book entertaining and educational, it made me feel good about being a woman in a way no other book ever has. As I read the book, I kept thinking how interesting it is that no one has ever looked at the critical contribution that women have made through food, to the success and building of this country, in quite the same light!I enjoy cooking so I found that aspect of the book enjoyable. I also like history and Ms. Schenone's book does a superb job of tying the two together.I liked it so much I sent copies to all of my girl friends as well as female family members. I highly recommend it whether you are a ""foodie"" or a history buff."
2,"A Fascinating Premise, But....","Worth a read but be prepared to be annoyed by the writer's frequent unscholarly historical assumptions, woolly thinking and sloppy writing. It would have benefited greatly from the assistance of a competent copy editor who might have (among the many, many, other errors) pointed out the difference between ""scion"" and ""icon."""
4,Wonderful Tales at an Affordable Price,Great tales of Ulster and the warriors of the red branch. The story of Deidre and the burden of her beauty is one of the greatest tradgedies of mythic Ireland. Also the stories of Bricriu are some of the most entertaining (the irish Loki). These tales far exceed the price tag.
1,"Too many bugs, glitches, unplayable",I installed the American Version for this game and had nothing but problems. The game would crash repeatedly. It was not my comupter or graphics card(ATI Radeon9800 Pro. It fact my system exceeded the requirements in everyway. There is practicly no technical support for this game so if you have a problem your out of luck. The game just does not work.
2,Frustrates Me!!!!!,"I got this game the first day it came out. By the third day I was on the second level. I was so excited because I had one more mission untill the third level. Well they don't explain in the directions how to save, so I came backk and by accident pressed new game. Therer was no way out so I exit out of the game and pressed resume game. My game was deleted. I warn you before you buy it is a fun game but not fun enough to start over. Listen to me and just play the demo."
5,Rich Dad Cashflow 101 Game,"Everything it says it does - it does. I did get much smarter about my finances. This game opened up my eyes on a lot of things and showed me what I was doing wrong with my budget and why I struggled. It also shows and teaches how to fix those mistakes I did. Thank you, Robert!"
3,Definetly for the Anglophile,"For lovers of classical guitar and London, this album is a great addition to a good CD collection.John Williams plays many of the songs on this album accompanied by full orchestra and chorus, and while the album does not bring out the extent of William's talent as one the world's best classical guitarists, it does evoke whimsical memories of London and is very well crafted. Let me put it this way, this album is best enjoyed on a rainy afternoon with a hot cup of tea. It is beautiful relaxing music that will not be dissappoint you."
1,Unit stolen from packaging,Received Garmin Navigator Package card product without card in clear blister package.Package opened and data card removed.Amazon immediately issued credit to account when empty package was returned and issued a coupon for my inconvenience.
2,Fitting guide is incorrect,It is a nice pad but is too small for the 1100 I have. Maybe it fits the 870/11-87 better.
3,tomarrow comes todat...love it!,"gorillaz are one of my new favorite bands and i think this album rocks, not just becuase im a fan but because i think they have some pretty fresh music. This album also has latin simone in english(latin simone is one of my favorite tracks). so if your a fan or just lookin for some new good tunes this is the album for you!!"
2,Camo watch,I bought this for my grandson. He was very excited but it did not work. The battery was dead. Cost me $18 for another battery.
5,Good timepiece.,"Another Christmas gift for the grandsons. I personally like the Timex brand, so I expect I got a good item as a gift."
4,Ideal Fit,"Great looking and perfect for my 12 yr old. The best is, it is not digital. Hurray for analog technology."
3,Battery Was Dead,"This was a christmas gift for my son. The battery was dead upon arrival. I am just going to have it replaced, rather than deal with the hassle of return/exchange etc."
4,Handy item,"My husband is a novice carver so I bought this for him. He doesn't like using it as he loses the ""feel"" of the wood but it is a good idea as a protection"
3,sound quality,"I am a huge fan of Nightwish, but I agree with the person who said the sound quality was poor. The more recent ""End of Innocence"" DVD has far superior sound. However this is a superb concert and performance by Tarja, the highlights for me are Swanheart and Beauty & the Beast."
2,Poorly authored,"The performance itself was very enjoyable, but the every 2 second jump cuts that are standard in modern music video was very annoying as usual.My major complaint is the disc itself. Whoever authored it was an idiot. Rather than doing the right thing and deliver a disc in anamorphic widescreen, they delivered a 4:3 presentation matted to 16:9. If you're going to deliver a 4:3 disc, don't screw the customer by cropping the top and bottom of the image, wasting vertical resolution on ""black"" bars rather than viewable image. On 16:9 displays you get side bars too, so the actual displayed image is perhaps half of the available viewing area."
2,"Nice mug, but...","I purchased this mug for my husband, and purchased 4 of the Dragonfly - Just Believe Ceramic Travel Mug from another seller. Except for the design on the mug, the mugs appear identical. What puzzles me and stops this from being a 5-star review is that the lid for this mug does not fit tight; its so loose you cannot tip it to drink from it without the lid falling out. So much for a travel mug."
2,I found this very difficult to read,"With all the fuss over whether this book was fact or fiction, I found it very difficult to read and accept. Since it's presented as non-fiction, I couldn't accept it as philosophy or parable, and found myself wondering whether it was really *true*. I don't think that's the point. It distracted me, and I found myself doubting the rest of the concepts."
4,Fundamental Issues in Strategy: A Research Agenda,"This book is not recomended for undergraduate, you must thinking hardly to understand the ""soul"" of this book. Read it carefully, once you read it, you will understand why the titled is""Research Agenda"", but anyway, this is usefull book for a reference in research or comprehensive analysis in area of strategy."
4,My son loves this poster,The item arrived on time and my son loves it. It's posted on the side wall next to his bed. He looks at it all the time. The picture quality is not perfect but for the price it's okay.
3,Pluto is no longer a planet!,"It's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. The poster is nice though. We didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot!"
3,Good as a beginner,I purchased the microscope for my son's science project and overall it was good. I found that using the Laptop componet was very combersome and extremely hard to use... so I gave up on that part...The only thing I would have liked is the ability to be able to adjust vertically and horizontally using the turning knobs.
4,Well made,"Well made microscope. Not plastic, like others. Wish the magnifying power was greater, but I knew what it was when I ordered it. For the price very good."
2,It could be better.,"First of all, it should be more user friendly. The directions are completely lacking and even with common sense it is difficult to figure out. I usually can not focus on the highest power because the lens is touching the scope. It took me a long time to figure out how to put the digital piece on the the microscope. The software is not intuitive either. I have used my digital camera on top of the regular eye piece and zoomed in to get a better look. I wish I had not waited so long to decide if it was worth keeping. I should have sent it back and tried something better."
1,Might be great,I tried loading the software on my PC to use the Microscope USB so my class could see what was under the microscope. I've had nothing but problems. When I emailed the software company they said they couldn't give me support because they don't support their software when it is packaged with an outside vendor's product. To date I have a $155 microscope I still can't use with my class because the software won't let me uninstall and even try to reinstall. What a drag. If someone would help me solve this problem I would surely change this review!
2,My First Lab Ultimate Digital Microscope MFL-85,"My First Lab Ultimate Digital Microscope MFL-85We had problems with the CD Rom included in the microscope. The program would not load onto the computer, we complained to the manufacturer and were told they would send us a return shipping box to change out the defective CD Rom. This was over a month ago and still we have not received any kind of help from the manufacturer for the defective part of our order !"
3,One-sided,"The author gives both the US and the South Vietnamese establishments severe slappings for their respective roles in this grim war.However, he fails to give the North Vietnamese establishment what would probably be an even more well-deserved kick up the backside for its role.In the end, this work, which is otherwise most impressive in its scope, detail and narrative, leaves you with the uncomfortable feeling that you have heard only half the story."
3,The book is funny and entertaining.,"I thought that ""Rich In Love"" really showed a realistic situation that many families experience today. I thought that Josephine Humphrey's explanation of the feelings that the characters were going through were thought out terrifically considering how many different views they were coming from. The way that the characters interacted with eachother in so many different ways was very entertaining. Humphrey also did a great job on focusing a certain amount on each character giving the reader a full understanding of where the characters emotions were at with all the stuff that was happening in their lives. I wish, though, that Lucille hadn't been such a witch to Wayne, he seemed really nice."
3,Interesting view on adolescent life,"I think this book did not mention an everyday's adolescent lifestyle, but it was an interesting view of a young girl. The title of the book summarises what the book and the character are all about , but it gives you explanations on how she finds that she is rich in love. The main character, Lucille, is an adolescent who seems like is 40 because of all her worries. She is not an adolescent who seems to enjoy life but rather enjoys having to save relationships. Overall, it was an interesting and at some times exciting to read. I wouldn't say its a book that will inspire your life but it is a book about finding yourself in the character."
4,"an interpretation on ""love"" as viewed by a teen","Rich in Love is a wonderful book on what todays teens interpret love these days. The main character, Lucille, shows us what it's like to be a teen in society. Love can be interpreted in many ways. Lucille's definition is based on the experiences she has been through, and once she realizes what love is, she finds out the other meanings it may take on."
1,Worst Book I've read in 5 Years,"This book is crammed so full of errors and simple mistakes I could barely finish reading it, in fact I am surprised I did. You can tell that the author is a far right-wing wacko just by how he structures the whole plot."
3,The Jury is still out,"I have an older streetpilot colormap. In order to be compatable with this card you have to make sure that you have updated firmware (just download it from Garmin), and a current copy of mapsource. Upgrades are available on Garmin's web site(mine was way old).It turns out that you can load more than 8 metroguide maps. You can have as many maps as space allows. Since they aren't all 8MB this is a real plus. My unit limits you to 50 maps, but you can get a lot of Roads and Recreation maps in since they vary from 64k to 400K. Garmin has very good phone support.I am having issues with my card though. Depending on where I am in the map set the unit will hang and sometimes shut off while navigating a route. I might just have a defective card. I will find out how Amazon handles these issues soon.Oh yes downloading nearly 64MB takes nearly four hours. The USB interface is looking very attractive (even if it is expensive)."
4,Classic Collector,"Troop 54, atten-hut!Over the years, I plan to collect as many series from the golden era of TV (1960s) as possible. The Jetsons' series is just one small step for me in a longer plan to acquire the classic shows from that era."
3,Good Book but not the best,"This book is not bad nor the best one.I found that dictiionary was best point of book it was nice to put the list of fay and give ya a guide to mythology to do the reseach why 3 star rating well forcing any elemental and spirt to do anything i do question,still had some nice things on it i just do more reseach and ignore the opinion this is mainly a guide to work with fay but by far not complete.I use the book for dictioary in back and add and new infomation that i discover. Good luck.Blessed Be;"
5,Great Message,"I saw this book at a friend's house, but did not have time to read it in its entirety. I was drawn to it by its beautiful illustrations and was not disappointed when I received the book and was able to read it and savor the artwork and its message of love and acceptance.I purchased this for my yet-to-arrive grandchild and am looking forward to reading it many times with my grandbaby for years to come."
4,Could this really happen?,"""Overshoot"" is a novel about global warming and other unexpected results of modern society.What is ahead of us in the 21st Century? This novel gives us one possible scenario. Eighty-year-old Moira Burke shares her experiences, past & present, and her actions as a result of thes experiences. The good thing about this book is that it's easy to follow even though you jump back and forth between the 20th and 21st centuries. A diary-style storyline improves the readability greatly. What's interesting too is the fact that much of the 20th century part of the book is based on real hapennings of the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's of our current century. Now that I have aroused your curiousity, get the book, think about the happenings and guess about how it comes out in the long run.""Overshoot"" is an enjoyable read but it's not a ""can't put it down"" type of book."
3,Rules Change,Played this game twice now with my 9 year old daughter and wife. The fundamentals of the financial learning are sound. But the rules make the game incredibly boring. For example if you offered a liability you must buy it rather than having the choice. And you can't always pay cash. Assets are only available to the player that drew the card. Where in real life there are almost always additional bidders. There are a lot of extra parts that don't seem to be needed (i.e. stands for cards). Stands for A few rule changes would fix this game to make it playable. With some testing the game could be great. It has the potential to be up there with Life and Monopoly. But it's not there yet. I'd love to help work on the game if the publisher would contact me. John at historic future dot com.
2,Read This Before Buying,"Although the Tai Funk Dance moves are fun to learn, this video is not what it promised. Camera angles make it difficult to learn the dance moves for one thing. Next, once you do manage to learn the routine, they only do the whole routine three times before the video concludes. Most exericse videos, such as Tai Bo, teach the moves individually and then have a 20-30 minute routine encompassing all you've learned. I didn't even work up a sweat doing this workout. Therefore, if your only interested in learning some new dance moves, then purchas this video. If you are actually wanting to exercise, purchase Tai Bo."
1,Save your money,This is a terrible workout video unless you like to learn the moves and then do them on your own. First of all the moves were hard to pick up because the camera is viewing at terrible angles and half the time an information screen blocks out the whole picture.I spent a lot of time jogging in place or doing my own thing while C note stood around blabbing. The program is very disjointed. If you appreciate the fluidity of going from move to move like Tae-Bo then you'll be bored out of your skull with this video.There are many better videos out there. Don't bother with this one.
2,Too Complicated,The only thing I like about this video was the beginning warm up with Chi Kung. That part was something to learn and use regularly. The workout is just a group of people teaching us one section at a time of a dance routine which is kind of complicated. After finally getting it down its not something you would want to do again. I was really dissapointed with this video.
2,Worse than it looks,"I bought this workout because it was one of first dance-aerobic routines available on DVD. It looked fun and intense. From MTV, I expected something very up-to-date with good moves and better-than-average music.It wasn't as good as it looked. Strange camera angles make it difficult to learn the moves. Often, the camera cuts away to an info screen and there's not enough verbal instruction to keep up without any visual input.Some of the instructors were quite good, giving clear explanations of how to get the most out of the steps they were teaching. However, many of the moves were taught by CNote members who, while fun to watch, obviously didn't really know what they were doing.I would have expected the workout to be a bit more intense than it was, but with practice it's probably possible to funk up the moves enough to make it worthwhile. Overall, the DVD may be a worthwhile investment for CNote fans, but probably not as a fitness tool."
4,Mr.,"Been using this machine commercially for 10 months and it works well enough that, being in the position for the acquisition of a second, I am buying a another. Don't stuff too much all at one time or it will freeze up. Otherwise, all is good!"
3,A good warm-up for an imminent classic,"If you haven't heard At the Gates, this isn't the one to start with. That would be their next album, ""Slaughter of the Soul"". However, once you've absorbed that one, make sure to get this one, too. At the Gates set a standard for Swedish death metal bands, basically breaking the constraints of traditional death, for a more melodic, exciting sound. This is sort of an EP, padded out with a few live tracks. Good stuff, but the band's masterpiece would be it's next one."
5,ONE OF THE VERY BEST,"AS ALWAYS, ANY MATERIAL WRITTEN BY HENRY BLACKABY IS AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE AND SO VERY HELPFUL IN THE DAILY WALK WITH THE LORD."
5,"my 60 "" sony t v",from start to finish this was the best purchase i have ever made. i love it.super bowl here i come!!!!
5,"Amazing picture, great value","My Sony KDS-60A2000 Grand WEGA 60"" SXRD 1080p Rear Projection HDTV was delivered 2 days ago and it is incredible. The picture is excellent and the controls are very usable. I did a lot of research before choosing this television, and am very happy with my choice."
4,"Xlnt for DVD, but SD was disappointing","I really like this TV, but the Standard Definition was not all that great. I adjusted some of the picture setting and it looks better, but it's still not great. My father in-law has the XBR1 and his SD looks fantastic. But I do want to add a caveat, that this may be a problem with my SD source. Others have reported xlnt SD. Also, the XBR2 will be coming out fairly soon, so if you're not in a hurry, you can wait for those, but watch out, these will be much more expense..."
2,We will not buy another Sony,Our picture is completely yellow and we only just learned that this tv has optical issues and has been close to recall. We have done all the due diligence on our part but we are 2 years past the deadline to act . We were never notified about optical block issues.
2,works but junky,I bought this to replace an ATT trimline that stopped working after more than 30 years. It does the job so far (2 days) but is in every respect feeble compared to the old one.
3,"Not like the ""old"" AT&T phones.","Still a nice phone with good sound quality, but without the weight in the cradle and handset, which was partially what I was looking for when ordering AT&T. Also, the keypad light is dim and uneven, unlike the previous evenly lit AT&T models I pourchased in the late 90's and early 00's."
3,"great for incoming calls, terrible keypad","The sound is clear, it works during power failures, it can dial from memory, the keypad lights, it's easy to see and pick up in a dark room, and it seems sturdy.The keypad is cluttered. When you glance from the phone book to the keypad, you have to pick out your digit from an array of 18 identically sized and spaced buttons.The buttons for fire, police, and medical help shouldn't be there. They add clutter and could easily be pressed inadvertently. If desired, the numbers could be stored with other numbers in memory. When every second counts, most people dial 911.The bottom row has flash, redial, and memory. These keys should be set off from the ten digits."
4,trim line phone,It is a perfect replacement. Works better than the old one and is lighter and has more features.
5,Extension phone,"Attractive, modern phone. Received promptly. Multiple items from this seller do not show up on the tracking list. Only the first shipped one does. Otherwise a good transaction."
1,Terrible Sound,"I have four children who consistently leave cordless phones off the base with dead batteries, so I decided to buy some good old-fashioned corded phones for my house. I bought two of these AT&T models and two from Uniden. Now the two kids who received the AT&T models in their rooms always have to use the phones in their Uniden siblings' rooms, because these AT&T models basically suck. And indeed, every time I've tried to answer the phone in a AT&T kid's room, without fail the caller asks me if I there is another phone I can use since they can barely hear me. Every time. If you're looking for an inexpensive, corded phone, go with a Uniden."
4,"Good phone, great price","I finally got tired of never being able to find my cordless phone when sitting at my couch. So, I decided that a couple of corded phones would be a good addition. Based on the number of reviews, this must be one of the most popular phones. I've found this to be phone of good quality. It sounds good, and it has a satisfing weight and the sound quality is good, probably better than my cordless phone. I'd happily recommend this phone. Keep in mind that this is just a phone. No answering machine, no caller-id, no batteries, no muss, no fuss, and no complications."
2,Phone Frustration,"I bought this phone a few years ago when it was manufactured in Mexico. And it was a pretty good phone. Lasted about five years. But now that it's manufactured in China, it is not the same quality. For example, the number keys don't light up completely. And this is right out of the box! Then the phone kept falling off the receiver on the wall. (My boyfriend fixed it for me, so that the phone will stay on the kitchen wall.) ... I'd like to just go to a phone store and pick a nice land phone out! But those stores are hard to find."
1,Believe the reviews. Don't even bother buying this phone.,"This phone is a joke. If I had a grandchild, I'd give it to her/him to take apart and learn about electrical stuff.I was purchasing this for use as a regular landline phone (unlike the rest of the world, I still use my landline 99.99% of the time). This phone gives you nothing except static interrupted occasionally by a dial tone. It is a hopeless item & I should have believed the other bad reviews, but I thought I'd be able to get it working.Skip to next item."
4,Basic little phone,"What can I say. It's cheap, looks OK, works - voice and dialing are fine.Your basic by the bed, hard wired phone.We have LifeAlert so you should have a hard wired phone in case the batteries go down on the wireless phones."
1,Rubbish.,Defective - loose handset connector creates static. This is the second one I've purchased over the past few years and the problem is only getting worse.
1,Unusable,"I have purchased several AT&T 210 corded phones over the past several years and have always been satisfied with the product. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has recently changed the design. If the only negative design choice was the use of a very light weight plastic, I could live with the consequences. That however is the least of the problems. The sound quality is so severely degraded that conversation is nearly impossible. I have experienced far greater clarity on international calls from third world countries. The 210 should not longer be referred to as a ""phone"" and should not even be offered for sale by Amazon."
3,Interesting but needs a less biased point of view,"This book fills a void in the history of the state of Nevada. But the author spends much time blind to the factors that devealop the state as a whole and their impact on Nevada's hispanics, and rather focuses on how the hispanics were just sufferers of white majority's whims. Nevada has a rich history of many races (Including many Chinese) and the facts presented in the book are befitting of Nevada's Hispanics. But the writing is choppy at best, and a second edition is sorely needed. The book seems as if it was very rushed towards it's finishing pages."
3,Make Sure You Know What You're Doing,"I bought this tv stand from Circuit City, for 50% off. Very happy with price. But, assembly has been a nightmare. I stripped the screws, and chipped the wood. Right now, I'm on my way to Home Depot to buy wood glue. Next time, I'll hire someone to assemble."
2,Who knew it had 1000 screws to assymble?,"Its built like a tank, with a enormous amount of screws. If yah like assymbly this is the cart for you. I also don't like that fact that the wheels are soo small, so its difficult to move around. To move on carpet and rough flooring yah need larger wheels, , kinda like the ones they made in the good ole 30's. Get an antique one, , you'll be a lot happier.Jim"
5,I love this item!,"I love these cards. They're beautiful. The illustrations are very,very pretty and I like that each one has a scripture reference. These are appropriate for all my family and friends. I would order these again. :)"
5,"Something Will Come Along, December 20, 2003","Malcolm and Jackie, your card arrived as I was well into Malcolm's book ""Something Will Come Along."" I loved it and hope it sells well. The logistics of your fequent moves took my breath away. I had always thought of Jackie to be extremely capable, but now! How you kept abreast if clothing styles for the children and yourselves due to changes in climate, cultures and ages is mind-boggling. Then too I found myself far beyond my usual bedtime laughing at Malcolm's humor. Thanks for sharing your unusual experiences and inspiring approach to life. I had come to a plateau in writing my memoirs for family and friends, but Malcolm's book has spurred me to plow on after Christmas. May your book appear under many Christmas trees."
4,Good stuff,"This EP is a nice addition for any collector of Pearl Jam, some rare cover tunes here and a surprised audience as well. Also when purchasing this you are supporting independent record stores as this is not on sale at Best Buy etc."
4,Quite Helpful,"In my early years in NT Greek I found this volume quite helpful. Every so often I still refer to it, if my mind seems to be playing tricks on me."
5,Garmin 32MB Data Card,Garmin stuff just works. I have it to add detailed map info to my GPSMAP 178C GPS/Sounder. It works as advertised. What more can you ask for?
2,essential disappointment,i was very disappointment with that book.ther is not enough monografs of oils.it is not for professional enough for healers.
5,Essentials Oils Desk Reference,"A must have in the home library. We refer to ours on a regular basis, not only for our own use, but to look up information for family and friends."
2,She's pretty but she drools,"I've been looking for a teapot where the handle does not get hot and that my tea cozy fits. This teapot met those requirements. I should have had a few more requirements to aid me in my search.Teapot lids traditionally have bumps on the bottom that correspond with notches in the top of the pot. Together, the bumps and notches--when used correctly, keep the lid in place. This pot has badly placed notche: the direct front and the direct back. These notches should be on the right and left side, or 9 and 3 o'clock if you prefer. This creates 2 problems: the tea dribbles out of the top of the pot if the pot is less than 3/4 full, and the lid falls off easily. Not acceptable for any teapot.For now, I've given up on using my tea cozy and am using a teapot from Bee House. It's not as pretty but it doesn't drool."
2,Fame can be manufactured by commercialism.,This is a typical case of a famous player receiving too much praise from uninformed public for a mediocre performance. Williamsfs rendition is mechanical and lacking elegance. Better phrasings would have resulted from stretching the guitar technique a little more (It is a myth that Williams is the best guitar technician). There are a number of better recordings of Bach Lute Suites: the definitive one is that of Goran Sollscher. There are many better classical guitarists than famous ones.
2,Very confusing,Very confusing. Each cube has different letters on it. Also the picture on each cube does not march the letter shown. Sorry but it is confusing. I am not happy at all.
2,Nothing in here on Boston,"The Boston Wedding Planner, unfortunately, does not live up to its title. There is really nothing here about Boston except 5 or 6 pages of various vendor listings in an appendix at the end. Do not buy this book if you are looking for Boston information. Better to just use the phone book."
5,Tunnel of Greatness,"If you are lookin for an album with rockin tunes than this not the album to get. This is the type of album that makes it a risky move on an artist who just had a lot of hits on his previous record. He still had two top ten hits. Brilliant Disguise and the title track. A couple of the songs he does by himself. Aint Got You, My Happy Valentine, Cautious Man and One Step Up he does byself, well, One Step Up does have backup vocals by his future wife. It is also the last album he used the E Street Band untill the 2002 album The Rising. Me personally, This my favorite bruce album. The song WALK LIKE A MAN is a song about a long obsession with his father, Aint Got You self-consious look about being a rock star. ONE STEP UP, TWO FACES, BRILLIANT DISGUISE AND TUNNEL OF LOVE ARE ABOUT reflections of his trouble marriage"
4,Key Issues addressed,"This was a bold and honest aprroach to a delicate subject. I particularly appreciate the perspective, for those who are not married, in not banning things which scripture does not address.It was confronting too; placing responsibility right back where it belongs with the reader. This book really helped me."
5,This is a must read for men looking to lead a Godly life.,"This book really hit the source of the problem for me. It did not give any self help methods or other 4 step success theories, but gave me the REASON I do the things I do. Revealing the source reveals the problem and brings us to our knees before God-the only one who can fully change us.I was impressed with his vulnerability and his tact. He made me want to tell others and let the healing process begin.Don't wait if you are dealing with the temptations of society, this book can help you be a different person tomorrow!"
5,When Good Men are tempted,"This is an excellent read for any man struggling with sensual lust. Looking, thinking or acting out, this is meat in due season. It is biblically based and shows the steps of how to tap into the power God has provided for us to become the men in Christ He wants us to become. Thanks Pastor Bill"
1,Not extremely biblical...,"To all men who are seeking to stay pure:While I did find some information in this book helpful, there was one major problem. The last chapter was practically pornographic. If nothing else it was explicit. I will simply say that I didn't buy the book as a ""how to"" manual for sex. Instead of helping me combat thoughts this book put new ones in my head. Half way into the last chapter I tossed this book in the trash. It was very unwise for the author to do what he did considering his audience... shame on you Mr. Perkins.I would ask all men to be extremely careful if you decide to read this book. You may be doing more harm than good. I implore those who purchase it anyway to skip the last chapter, in the name of Jesus. For an AMAZING book, purchase ""At the Altar of Sexual Idolatry"" by Steven Gallagher. That book was solid in the Word and full of wisdom! It really helped!"
4,An effective treatment of an amazing woman,"This is a well written and effective biography of one of America's most amazing personalities. Mary Beth Rodgers tells Jordan's story with the advantage of being an insider; her access to those who knew Jordan well shows in her insightful and complete telling of Jordan's life.Jordan is widely remembered by her public persona, the booming orator from Texas - the intellectual constitutional scholar who presided over Nixon's impeachment. But element that makes this biography compelling is Rodgers' depiction of the wheeling and dealing that allowed Jordan to cross barriers and operate effectively in the good-old-boy white male backrooms of the Texas Senate. We get to see Jordan the idealist armed with the constitution in our nation's capital, but we also get to see Jordan the pragmatist cutting deals over a scotch in Austin Texas.An effective biography of an amazing American figure."
4,Excellent illustrations,The book has great detailed illustrations and helps with gaining familiarity with the Japanese terminology of each step. Covers key points as well.
1,Bad Switch,"This steam-iron system was a great ""idea"", but poorly built. The switch went out on mine too. It gets up to pressure but the sole plate will not get hot. It was great while it lasted. Not sure I'll buy another one."
3,Okay!,I'm not really a big fan of spicy cinnamon flavored candies and I usually hate cinnamon flavored jelly beans but this Sizzling Cinnamon flavor from the Jelly Belly Candy Company is okay and I would recommend it to anyone who likes spicy cinnamon candies but there are other flavors I prefer over the Sizzling Cinnamon!
3,Looks over function,"I replaced a B&D Iron with this model and was somewhat disapointed. It leaks, there is no question about it. I also have found while the iron is hot, heats quickly, the shot of steam is weak and doesn't recover quick enough to make it a useful feature. I had the iron replaced under warranty, and the new one did the same thing, leaked. The B&D out performed this one!"
1,"Overpriced, cheaply made iron","This overpriced iron was horrible! First off, it has a tiny little water tank, good enough for about 2 of my nice heavy cotton dress shirts.I dropped it off the ironing board, and the PLASTIC base shattered. I only used it a few times, but since it was past the ""1-year warranty"", the company felt obligated to do nothing.So, I bought a Euro-Pro Professional Iron!! This one kicks butt!"
3,Holly,"I must agree with Hope's review. I bought this iron approximately 2.5 years ago and loved it until it began to show signs of electrical shorting: The iron turns on and off depending on the angle of the power cord, which makes me suspect that the cord is severing at the connection point to the iron, somewhere beneath the protective rubber housing. An iron this expensive should last longer than 2.5-3 years."
2,Won't last long,"I purchased a Rowenta about two years ago and it will be my last. This iron was impressive out of the box but quickly became a less than stellar performer. I followed all instructions to the letter and after 3 months the iron produced less than half the steam it did when new. I used the self clean function but to no avail, the iron simply stopped producing steam like it had originally. Then came the infamous Rowenta water leaks and now the iron no longer heats at all. I will never buy another Rowenta product based upon my experience and the support from their customer service. Two and a half years from a sixty five dollar iron is less than acceptable. If you are enamored with the name buy one, but your money will be better spent on another brand."
2,Hmmmm...,I'm not sure what to make of this movie. I'm all for avante-garde cinema and this had a bit of that. But something just wasn't right. The film had a look of one of those cheap BBC crime films. I think the movie had the right idea but it just wasn't executed well. I'm gonna stick with the book.
5,Super Digestaway,Some years ago my physician suggested I start taking Super Digestaway for my digestion problems. I've been taking it ever since and have never regretted it.
4,"Weak legs, but cool design","There's a lot to love about this figure. It's so unique in the Star Wars universe. In fact, it looks like something out of a 1980s sci-fi flick. The blade on top actually rotates like a helicopters. The wires are very well done, giving this figure a ""used droid"" look. My only complaint is that, because the legs are so thin, the figure doesn't really stand well and might stoop. One way to address this problem is to open its mouth wide enough so it acts as a ""third leg."" However, I wish Hasbro had used a harder plastic for those legs. Overall, this is still an awesome piece for any Star Wars figure collection."
1,Pure opinion,"If personal opinion and biases and subjective thought are worth reading, Perrucci is worth a read."
1,disagreeable,I found all the sex without love sad and distasteful. The protagonist was overcome with loneliness and had no self-respect.
1,An impressionistic portrait of despair,"I came to this book with a lot of excitement. It has been so well reviewed, and I've liked Mary Gaitskill's previous works. But this book disgusted and frightened me. It must be one of those critical darlings that repel the casual reader. It isn't that I'm not interested in prose poetry, which this, at times, becomes. It is that I can't stand sloppy sad prose poetry. Impressionistic prose on the subject of violence and despair and cruelty and wasted life is unbearable to me. This is a portrait of a woman with a moral disease. A disease of the consciousness. And the prose takes you right into her interiority, a mute place that lacks insight into anything but the force of despair and terror on the surface of things. Maybe it is a social comment, but I couldn't stand the sensibility and, in fact, I didn't really connect with the most poetic or ""original"" parts at all. This book gave me the creeps."
1,Boring Book,"I read the review for this book in People magazine some time ago. It was a favorable review, and the idea of a model, heroin, AIDS, and hepatitis sounded good. Yeah, I like those twisted drug books. I purchased the book and read about a hundered pages of it. It was so boring I put it down. I just didn't care for any of the characters or their storylines. In the first hundred pages there is not much about the heroin or AIDS and the book is only a little over two hundered pages. There is nothing worse than spending time on a boring book. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Lived a reasonably long life.,"I don't think this iron is any longer available. I bought mine in 2001 and it finally died. It stared when the auto-off device started kicking in far too soon. Now, it won't turn on at all. For those of you who own this item, be forewarned."
1,Rowenta's poor customer service,"I owned this iron for six months when I started having problems with it leaking excess water on my clothes. I called Rowenta, and they had me send it in for service. Most people only have one iron, so this was a real inconvenience. It was repaired; three months later I had the same problem. Rowenta's customer service representative was extremely rude, complacent about my recurring problem, and gave invalid excuses for the malfunction. He told me to send the iron in again. It would cost me another $10 to do so; and, again, they were not going to pay for postage. So, after deciding I did not want to go without my iron again and investing a total of $20 in postage I opted to throw it in the garbage. I now own a Euro-Pro and am extremely pleased with it."
4,Magical Musings,"If one is going to get swooned by anyone, it certainly should be by this emerging delight.Her style is fresh and her lyrics have depth.Lullaby has what many strive for. The ability to fill her amazing voice with sweet tenderness and love, giving the listener more than one needs to fill the body and vibrate the soul.She knows what she has to offer. One wonders, do you? [vivian dean]"
5,Garmin is the best,"This works as advertised.It is easy to load the new map data onto the card and, when finished, simply insert into the Garmin 196 Aviation/Land/Marine GPS."
2,American Tribute,"The CD had a defect right on the song we needed. We were disappointed, because Amazon has been very good with everything elsed. We would love to have a replacement."
1,Can't see what all the fuss is about,I bought this after reading the reviews and frankly what a load of tosh......it was instantly off the CD and felt what a waste of money.I've been following prog since 1971 and have a fair amount of experience but this does nothing. Still only my opinion.
2,Time To Retire!!,"Why does every time when Fates Warning release a new album, most of the tracks are slow???? I just cannot understand them. So many slow materials ever since A Plesant Shades Of Grey till this album... Can't they just blast the damn %&^*ing music full volume???? I rest my case you go and figure it out.. Just so frustrated!!!"
5,Excellent CD,"After seeing Fates Warning with Queensryche and Dream Theater in 2003 I purchased Disconnected and A Pleasant Shade of Grey also. I love these 3 cd's, their current one being my favorite. It's mellow, yet very progressive and every song is just a great listen. For the earlier Fates Warning fans I'm sure this doesn't compare to those operatic vocals going on, but these cd's show a mature Fates Warning and I'm sure that's what you need to achieve as time goes on. Each cd needs to be different and this one differs from Disconnected as Disconnected differed from A Pleasant Shade of Grey. If you're new to Fates warning pick up this cd, you'll be glad you did."
3,Covers some basics,"This DVD gives a cursory overview. I expected more detail on technique. Maybe the DVD's in this series (I purchased three) are a little over priced for the content, but seeing proper technique displayed is very useful."
3,Good basic knowlage,"This book gives the reader a good basic knowledge of French wine. An excellent introduction to the field. The references are very good and information is good, the only critisism is that it comes across too silly. I got the impression that the author was almost ""talking down"" to me. Good overall."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FAN!,"I was tired of the cheap metal Wal-Mart fans and decided to purchase something better this time. Well, I paid $44.00 for this fan and it could not have been more poorly made if they had designed it that way.The construction of this fan is inferior to the least expensive fan I've seen any where else. The motor and handle were shifted off to the side so it was out of balance and it did not work any way.I ended up ordering an Air King, which is made in the United States and appears to be much better. I know one thing, no matter what the new one is like it would have to be better than this thing.I normally don't leave negative feedback, but this required it. If I had paid $4.99 for this fan I would have thought it too high. Thank you."
5,super drive center,"Nice tool (lathe center) for the price. Well packed in a hard plastic slip case for future keeping when not in use! Bagged and oiled to prevent rust, very nice tool! Very nice labeling and packing, well made.1/3 the price of name brand and for woodworking lathes it is just as good as far as I can tell."
4,Very secure,"This center has a very nice imprint when engaged and without undo dig, it holds very securely. I like this one a lot for small items that don't have much depth tolerance."
5,Dated but worthwhile,"M.P. Hall was quite a guy. He was obviously very well read and quite a popular writer. For those who do not know who this guy was, read ""Master of the Mysteries: The Life of Manly Palmer Hall."" He was the leading figure in comparative religions before Alan Watts and did groundbreaking work in the ""spiritual entertainer"" profession. Many of Hall's books are well worth reading. By far the one most worth owning is Hall's ""The Secret Teachings of all Ages."" Go for the hardbound version with color illustrations B001EWLTHG ."
5,Great entry level speaker,"The sound coming out of this speaker is crisp, clean and clear. I even lowered the master volume on my Pioneer AV system since the sound coming out of this speaker is so much better than my speaker in a box. I highly recommend this speaker for anyone not wanting to break the bank."
2,kiss your delicates good buy,"I bought it based on consumer reports great ratings, and all they said was true. I did not liked that it was really heavy, it took for ever to cool and even on the lower setting it was really hot and burned my delicate shirt after that the plate had to be cleaned with a special product since the fabric staked to it. I returned it and got full refund. As another reviewer said if you are a man or someone ironing male shirts this is the iron for you."
4,A Wonderful view of Newfoundland,"I found this book while staying at a B&B in Newfoundland, and it was such a wonderful read that I had to run out and buy a copy to take home with me. With wonderful insights into the people of Newfoundland the authors use powerful images and the words of the Newfoundlanders themselves to tell the stories of the place. Alternately powerful and fun, this book is a must for anyone wishing to understand the lives of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and their place in history and Canada."
2,Hot Sounds,Bought this because of a review in an audiophile music mag. I have dropped my subscripion to that mag. The sound is nothing special.
4,A great book to add to your floral crafting collection,"This is another wonderful floral craft publication from Leisure Arts. To avoid repetitition I invite you to view my reviews of ""How to Arrange Dried Florals If You Think You Can't"" and ""How to Do Wreaths If You Think You Can't"" as both of these books follow the same format as this one. The only reason I have not rated this book as well as the others is that I prefer the finished look that only high quality ""silks"" can achieve and not all projects in this book achieve this look. Still, there are nearly 90 projects for your review and the vast majority of them deserve credit."
3,Gran Voyevode,"Claudio Abbado el genial director italiano tiene un conjunto de grandes grabaciones, lamento decir que la quinta de Tchaikovsky no es una de ellas, falta fuerza y lo mas importante la orquesta suena vacia, falta sublimidad, sutileza y vigor, los intrumentos no brillan como cuando dirige a la Orquesta de la Scala, Abbado sabe de direccion y es querido y reconocido por su capacidad, pero siento que la Sinfonica de Chicago no alcanza el nivel del director.Para esta sinfonia Karajan es la opcion comun, para lo mejor Ormandy y Bernstein estan incomparables.Respecto del Voyevode, al igual como ocurre con la Tempestad junto a la sinfonia N2, los poemas sinfonicos sobresalen respecto de la otra obra suenan mejor, este CD tiene ese logro pero no alcanza para alabarlo mas, el Voyevode de Inbal en Philips es genial."
5,A Great Cast of Characters,"I loved Saffron, the main character in this fantastic new book aboutmotherhood in LA and life beyond it. She was funny and fallible, slightly overweight, and was totally not politically correct. What a breath of fresh air. Mothers here are constantly being told what to do, how to look and what to say--it was fun hanging out with Saffron for those three-hundred and twenty pages, I wish there were more women like her out there!"
2,review for schaum's outline serires on Fortran77 programming,This book is too elementary to be helpful for anybody with any experience in programming.
2,joust,while i usually love her writing this was too discriptive causing it to move way too slow. sadly i bought more in the series and cannot talk myself into continuing on a great story line.
3,Repetitive,"As the first book I've read by Mercedes Lackey, I'm not too impressed. First, as some others mentioned, the action is incredibly slow with way too much description bogging it down. Some of it would actually be interesting if the author didn't launch every five paragraphs into a comparison to Vetch's former life with Khefti. Most readers understand after the first few pages that Khefti is the stereotypical cruel master. Enough said.I enjoyed a few of the moments when the book showed some of the character's memories of his family, but then it would simply lapse back into Khefti, who, after ten pages, seemed rather trivial. Throughout the book I felt that the main character should just get over it and MOVE ON. The idea of the dragons is interesting, but it could be done with less cliche and in about 50 less pages."
5,Great!,"i really enjoy all of this author,however i dont like the homosexuality in it. it is written like its for 12 year olds yet they probably shouldnt read it. when is the next one coming out! i cant wait!!"
1,Disliked it,My four year old begged me to buy him power rangers....and i bought two of these and I was really disappointed. They are all in peices now. I didn't know that ever body part came apart to you can do whatever you want with them. I think my son would have perferred an action figure that didn't come apart while he was playing with it as what it should be intended to do.
5,Novus Plexiglass polish,"I am a pilot and have used Novus as a plexiglass polish for aircraft windshields for years. Novus doesn't scratch or craze the surface of the plastic, and it can even polish out small scratches. I have also used two other grades of Novus containing fine to coarse polishing grit to remove fairly severe scratches from damaged windshields to good effect. I highly recommend the stuff. I haven't found anything better yet."
4,Works fine,"This kit fits well, and seems sturdy enough. I like that this one has a pocket. Some don't. However, there are some strange plastic ribs inside the pocket that can sometimes get in the way when you try to put things in it. Also, the plastic is a passable match to the factory parts in color and texture, but it's not exact by any means."
5,"Informative, insightful, and well written.","This book is not only a superb source of practical information for professionals working with patients afflicted with dementia, memory loss, and/or Alzheimer's, but it is also a great source of hope and inspiration to the patients' relatives and caregivers. The blend of expert advice with compassionate care motivates me to highly recommend this book. I think all people involved with caring for those with dementia will benefit from reading this excellent book."
5,fundamental book,"I needed information after my dad was freshly diagnosed with dementia. This book was a great guide, sadly absolutely correct in every aspect. It helped me prepare for what was to come and I highly recommend it. It's better to be prepared and this book is the one to do it. Well-written, practical and true."
2,This book is a killjoy,"As a longtime Julie Garwood fan, I buy her books as soon as they are available. I wish I'd saved my money this time. This book was a total disappointment. The story rambled, the characters were so boring I was cheering the hitman on instead of the hero and heroine. Everyone has a miss now and again, this was Garwood's. She was so caught up in the elaborate plot and subplot she completely lost her way and her reader. My advice to readers, if you want to read it, borrow from a friend or the library, don't waste your money."
1,Laughable,"I really wish Ms Garwood would stick to historical romances instead of contempary, at least then the heroine in the book is in context to the language. I am sick and tired of reading a woman in this day and age speaking like some goody goody girl in times gone by. Who in this day and age says ""Goodness"" repeatedly? And I sure there is not one woman alive on this planet that yells ""Heavens to Betsy!"" when she orgasms. Either stick to historicals Ms Garwood, or bring your contempary heroines into the 20th centuary."
4,Great book!,"I like the way Julie Garwood writes, this book kept me interested the whole time and had an interesting twist at the end I didn't see coming. Just enough romance and suspense, I would recommend it."
4,Showcase,"This album shows Gershwin, Grofe, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in characteristic form. Exemplary. Bernstein conducts with swagger and bravado. While I prefer Leonard Slatkin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""American in Paris"", I have lived a better life for having heard Bernstein's, too. I've listened to this recording many times."
4,Great general bible overview,This book provides a good outline / general overview of the books of the bible based on a literary view. Definitely helped as an introduction to the bible. If you are looking for indepth study of each book of the bible you will want to find another study material but this is worth having in your bible study library.
2,Through the Bible In One Year; A must for the serious studen,"When I had the privilege to study this work under Dr. Stringfellow, I was fed by a true student of the word of God. Dr. Stringfellow made the Bible come alive which made me want continue studying after he completed thre study. I was able to go through the study a total of three time with this magnificent man of God. I came out with a great knowledge of the word of God which led me to further studying of the word of God. I would highly recommend this study to any student of the word of God.After going through this study, one can feel blessed by God."
1,Too general,"This book is too general. It's like a 'review' of techniques used, methods in robotics etc. Furthermore, you need other books to be able to help you to understand what it's talking about."
4,"They are OK, but not as good as the ones that came with the boots.","These laces OK, but they aren't as good as the original laces that came with the Danner Boots. They aren't as ""solid"" feeling. There were only 2 laces in the pack too, not three."
4,Great lesson for all ages!,"This script may not live up to the book (I can't answer that as I haven't had the pleasure of reading the book...YET), but in itself, I think it's a winner!We ran into it be accident and have watched it at least 4 times since Saturday afternoon. My 6 year old LOVES it. Some mild violence and peril, but all turns out well in the end. For a second I thought the ending would be too much for a 6 year old. Maria jumps into the ocean to sacrifice for her family, but within seconds, she is rescued by a beautiful unicorn and the end is magically and nicely tied up. The music is beautiful as well.As a parent, I loved the lessons of forgiveness AND being able to say you are sorry. Excessive pride can lead to ruin, as this movie shows.I plan on purchasing the book and reading it with my daughter. I am sure she will enjoy it as much as she did the movie."
3,The Secret of Moonacre,the secret of moonacre ..it was ok. I did not check far enough and though it was a Terry Pratchart movie. my bad. I admit that this review process it a bit picky.
1,Useless without MA-LFQM multi-location fan/light control,"Bought this as it said it was compliant with ""virtually all existing wiring"". What it fails to mention until you scroll down into the product description is that this item will not work without the MA-LFQM multi-location fan/light control. So essentially, it's useless unless you have the other component.The description needs to be updated - it's very misleading."
4,"Practical, common sense thinking","This book has a religious basis, though I believe its principles are useful to anyone regardless of his religious beliefs or lack of belief. The book talks about having confidence and persistence toward achieving a valued goal, pursuing the means toward that goal ethically, and trying every ethical alternative to achieve that goal. The book talks about God, but there are many definitions and conceptions of God, other than Christian. The book talks about the Bible and its stories and there are many ways to interpret the Bible other than literally. The point is this to me: Peale's advice is common sense and practical for those looking to improve their attitude and approach to life whether they are traditionally religious or not. Browse through the book and decide for yourself. It's well written and an easy read."
1,Really won't fit either end,"I have a regular shop-vac and a 10"" hitachi miter saw. This converter has exactly the same sizes on both ends. They won't fit for any ways. You will need 2-1/4 to 1-1/4 converter and I have ordered it to see."
1,"Stale coffee, no expiration date.","This coffee was very stale, it had no expiration or product date.The coffee had no body, no aroma,very harsh tasting.The company refused to replace it or give a refund.We had this same coffee once before and it was verygood. Just must have been a bad batch or old."
2,Really?,"One phrase by Evert Vedung on the definition on evaluation should be enough to clarify my review title: ""Evaluation is retrospective assessment of public interventions. Prospective appraisals (...), are not included in my definition.""(p.7).Even considering the narrowest interpretation of the term ""public policy cycles"" as solely formulation-implementation-evaluation phases, it doesn't seem to me that most writers in the area cope with the idea of an evaluation phase so reductionist."
5,Light and Happy,"This perfume smells amazing! I don't like heavy perfumes at all. I get compliments on this one all the time! It's not too flowery or fruity. It's just a very light, fresh smelling scent.My favorite scents include: DG Light Blue, Fresh Brown Sugar, Tocca Bianca, DG Rose The One, B&BW; Sweet Pea, and Burberry Brit. If you're a fan of these scents, you'll probably like Omnia Crystalline."
3,Just o.k.,"While I found some parts of the book to be quite enjoyable, there were whole sections that I found to be extremely tedious and the ending left me disappointed."
3,Interesting read,"Written in the ""oral language"" style, this is a great read. Madeline Solomon is an Alaska native and bilingual teacher who shares her life experience with the reader. This is only one of a series of books, I highly recommend if you plan to teach in any of the areas that the books cover. Mrs. Solomon's book covers the Holy Cross, Koyukuk and Nulato Region. It is a quick and easy read as it was ""designed for upper level elementary students living in rural Alaska"". This book may be difficult to find due to the limited publication in 1981."
5,"Hardcover ""Vintage Style""","Since I loved the ""Vintage Style"" pattern collection enough to commit right away to three different projects, I couldn't resist purchasing this new hardcover edition. It has at least one important correction, because it includes the yarn color key to the chart for the Kaffe Fassett vest that was inadvertently omitted from the softcover edition. This is not a book for brand-new knitters, because the patterns use light- to medium-weight yarns, include shaping, and may utilize ""advanced"" techniques like intarsia. However, the finished garments are well worth the effort! Many of the patterns can be previewed on the web sites of Rowan yarn retailers that carry the ""Vintage Style"" pattern collection."
4,great cd but miss the old crew,"pat is a master guitarist..great jamming on pat's part. the trio setting gives pat plenty of room to manuever. as a drummer i do enjoy stewarts playing . i do admit since gottlieb stopped drumming with metheny i've lost some interst in the groups work . the interplay with egan, mays, and gottlieb in the early years was pat at his best. i do believe that pat is a much greater player today than 20 years ago, but the older records had more of ensemble feel to them. i would be interested to see gottlieb in a trio setting with pat, his drumming fits with pats sound the best."
4,A long-awaited release,"Just glanced at a website that dismissed this Oliver Nelson reissue, which I've long awaited, saying that ""nothing exciting happens."" I'd dare anyone to listen to the band's version of ""Milestones,"" with the dueling saxophones of Nelson and, I believe, Tom Scott, and not become excited. Check out Nelson's soaring poignancy on ""I Remember Bird"" as well...Now his fans need ""Black, Brown and Beautiful"" released from whoever owns the defunct Flying Dutchman catalog."
3,Basic book,I found this book to cover just about the same information as all the other Family Reunion planning books. It really did not give me any new ideas. I was looking for fun and interesting things to plan for my family reunion but it did not have any. It just talked about the basic planning but did not give ideas. It would be an ok book if you never planned a reunion before.
1,pointless,I purchased this DVD based on positive reviews. I think that the quality standards of this supposed educational tool are embarrassing- the graphics are rudimentary and there is very little useful content. My son scorned it. I found it painful to watch.
4,Great,I found that this book address issues dealing with inter racial dating and under age relationship very well. It was written very well.
1,Oh God help whoever has to read this!,"After about 200 pages of redundant descriptions of the working class conditions things start to happen, and they aren't worth reading either. I'm in college now, and would like nothing more to castrate my professor who assigned this tortorous assignment."
3,Another Bland Version,"of this wonderful music. If you want a straight ahead version, you'd be better off with Grumaux.Stern has always been overrated."
1,ZZZZZZ... by M. Boucher,"What starts as a good soap opera novel turns out to be sudsy-less. The characters aren't appealing, the pacing is slow, and the story is uninterested. Jacqueline Birskin is off of my reading list. Sorry, Miss Birskin, wherever you are..."
3,Not what I expected.,Reading the title of the book I expected that it was one of those books that described the actions to do along with a song (or Psalm). But it just lists the scripture verse and a simplified version of the Psalm. He doesn't give suggestions on HOW to sing it. I suppose you just make up your own melody. I have a toddler so I thought it would be another resource to help me teach him scripture to my kinesthetic learner. But that's not the case. I like that the author simplified the ideas of the Psalm into language that a young ears can understand. It just wasn't what I expected.
2,Gator G-Shock is cheap copy of Thermodyne RackPack,"The Gator G-Shock is poorly made and flimsy, although I'm hoping it's good enough to get my equipment safely through airline baggage handling. It is a cheap copy of the Thermodyne RackPack, which costs almost 4 times as much. An advantage of the G-Shock is that it weighs less than the Thermodyne, important in my case, since I need to stay within the airline's 70 lb checked baggage limit."
2,Good DVD if you can find a valid copy,"I bought this NEW and SEALED from a reputable seller, problem was, the words ""FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY, NOT FOR SALE OR RENT' appeared splashed across the screen in bright yellow letters as the DVD played. You cannot get rid of it as it was burned into the actual video footage. I returned it and bought a NEW one from a different seller. Same thing, ""FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY..."" showed up on the screen. I finally had to buy a used copy and asked the previous owner if it had these words. Finally, after a third attempt, I got a valid copy. I am not blaming the sellers because the DVD's were sealed and there was no indication on the covers that it was not for resale. Just want to make potential buyers aware..."
5,Brilliant,"As an older audiophile (in my 50's) I'd thought the fidelity of our flat screen monitor was satisfactory until I added a pair of these (running through a Parasound Model 275 amp). Now I've been thrilled to go back and watch all my favorite movies (Das Boot/Gladiator/Matrix) and be absolutely stunned at the explosion of sound that was hidden there all this time.Exceptional clarity, beautiful ability to create a sense of depth and imaging without using that fake 'Surround sound' setting on the TV itself, and the dialog is all back where I can hear it, in the right location.By comparison, my brother purchased a typical home theatre set up for about double the price (Surroundsound amp, sub, satellites, center speaker) and the result is novel for the 'behind the head' effect but disappointing for the lack of clarity and imaging. The bass even isn't as good as a single pair of these NHT's.Give me fidelity any day. A great product!David"
5,Ok,"Again Barrons keeps to its style of writing review books that are somewhat more difficult than the actual test. Overall I think they have a good book here. Unfortunately there are some noticeable typos, wrong answers in practice exams and that sort of thing. However if you are decent, they won't be a problem and you'll benefit from the 4 practice exams in the book."
3,known music,"I think the song you are thinking of for the trailer is 'The Dolphins Cry' by Live. I heard it when I saw the commircle, it's an awesome song"
5,"Care-free, Dreamlike Mixed-Music Album.","This is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time! It starts off with a wicked,techno-dance-inducing song,Snakeblood. Then from there, it goes into some very beautiful, trancelike dreamy enigma-esque songs: Pure Shores, Porcelin,Voices and 8 Ball. These songs are just awesome for reflecting-time, or as background music to conversation.I also loved the fun,jazz-sounding 'Return of Django'. All the songs just impressed me. The movie was awesome as well.An excellent album to keep in your player at all times for any occasion!"
4,Good Mix,"I haven't yet bought the c.d. but have heard different songs off the radio and such. It seems to have a good mix of electronic type music (since a lot of music is electronic nowdays). The songs from the trailers are Porcelain by Moby (remixed I believe) and Touched by Vast (awesome cd, highly recommended). I hope that this helps"
5,Danny Boyle always gets the best music for his movies,"In the traditionn of Trainspotting and The Acid House, Danny Boyle once again gets the best music for his flics...If you dig the headier side of electronic music-this is the stuff. Also, the movie is just as good as the book! Layered with themes of honesty, freedom, ""civilization"", commerce, etc. Like, Trainspotting, the book was great on its own, but, the movie was darn good as well. For those who liked the book but not the movie-its a matter of knowing how to interpret a visual and audio experience versus the litterary one..."
3,Song from trailer,"The song played in the trailer was ""Touched"" by VAST. The song is not available on the soundtrack but is available on the self-titled album, VAST (Visual Audio Sensory Theater). The rest of ""The Beach"" album is ok, but it was a mistake not to include the VAST song."
4,"Listen to the Music, Read the Book, Forget the Movie!","Unfortunately, the soundtrack is the only good thing about this movie (and the music IS great and perfectly fits the story -- moody, dreamlike, and pumped full of adrenaline). But do yourselves a favor and avoid this Hollywood-pureed, condescending piece of junk. Flex your intellectual muscles and read Alex Garland's amazing book instead!"
4,Just Because I Rated it 4 Stars Doesn't Mean It's Not Great,"As many of you might already know Keith Jarrett plays classical music these days. This album features a great four-piece group and the jazz they make is wonderful! Lots of inventiveness and interplay. Most notable is the playing of Charlie Haden, such a sweet tone and note selection is just great.I had this on cassette, so this was a replacement purchase. I must say that I'm enjoying listening to the songs. This is progressive jazz, lots of straightahead pieces with some other moody tracks for lots of variety. It's not for everyone--but for those who appreciate the kind of jazz this is will be rewarded for buying it."
5,Great value for the price!,"I don't know why this product isn't advertised more.It's a great light stand!!!Lightweight, but stable. And I looove the fact that it's air cushioned!"
3,Learning to Fish again,"We purchased the Go Fish Study Guide to accompany the Go Fish DVD. Our Bible Study group uses the 20 minute DVD to have a common knowledge of the materials before we begin answering the questions at the end of session. We find excellent interaction by all participants. We have a range of backgrounds, ages and knowledge in our group. This study format bridges the differences and helps us to understand the importance of our personal experiences in witnessing to others.Andy Stanley provides an excellent sermon on the topics each week. A longer version of the Sermon is available on the DVD and that is viewed by some individuals in the group as well."
4,What's not to like?,I have no idea how to sew these on. I think ballet foot/leg wear is awkward & strange. But it seems nice..from where it sits on my 3.5 year old daughter's shelf.
5,VERY NICE,I received my solar lights when they stated I would. Easy to put together. I really like that they have 7 different colors not just 4. I have been getting manyu compliments about them from my neighbors. I will probably order more if they are still available.
4,A good value,"Don't believe all the whiners here who left negative feedback. I owned an exerciser like this some years ago with nylon rope and plastic pulleys. It was a great, quick workout at home and I lost the thing in a move. I was glad to get a similar item with elastic bands for only $10. As far as using it, just bind the doorhandle loop with a rubber band or tape. To move away from the door, just add a length of nylon 3/8 inch rope. What the heck do you expect for $10!"
2,"Great Idea, POOR MATERIAL","This is a great idea if you want to exercise at home BUT it's a shame they use such CHEAP material in order to make this item. The rope wears off VERY quickly. In the first few exercises your face will already be full of black shredded pieces from the rope which gets in your mouth and eyes and drives you CRAZY. So stupid!! Also, AMAZON sent me an used one which is so obvious once you look at it. Shame on Amazon. Item was supposed to be brand new. The rope is also damaged. It really shows it has been used. Ridiculous.The reason why I will not send it back it's because its not worthy the headache and time wait for another one for the $11.99 value. Shame on Amazon, Shame on Ballys for making such a cheap item. I guess you get what you pay for..."
5,Great.,"If you are a fan of the one and only Sonny Chiba, then I suggest you add this to your collection of Sonny Chiba movies. This movie has everything you would expect from a Sonny Chiba movie. Action and more action. I am a Sonny Chiba fan and I would recommend this and just about anything else Sonny Chiba did to any fan of Grindhouse action movies. Two Thumbs Way Up!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This drive not recommended,"I had one of these. It worked for about two years and then died. I lost all of my data. (After searching the internet, I found that there are known issues with this model, and others experienced the same problems I did.) I called Maxtor tech help. They said nothing could be done. And, they recommended I buy a new one. I would not recommend this product."
1,Intel GMA950 no workie,"After much work, I cannot get this to work with my configuration. I have a Mac Mini with a Intel GMA950 board, the video card is DVI-I not DVI-D, however, at any resolution, I tried at least 100 different ones, each with refresh rate variations, and cannot get sync with my Samsung 1080i CRT TV. I imagine the cable is working correctly, but not for me."
1,rewritten books? Why?,"It would seem that this author has taken it upon herself to re-write all of the Star Wars books. I don't know how she got permission, or why. I was about to buy this until I noticed that these books were not the original. George Lucas originally novelized A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Now I admit, they weren't more than taking the scripts and making them prose, which was a bit dull, but they were the originals. The second trilogy was novelized by three different authors. Phantom Menace was written by Terry Brooks and he did a wonderful job.Now tell me why I would want to buy this series when they are not the original stories? Are they junior novels and edited for a younger age group? It doesn't say so in the information given. If that's the case, then I would understand and maybe even buy it for my kids."
3,challenging and bizzare,There is one track on this CD that is easy on the ear 'LA BAMBA'It shows what might have been. The rest ( all 20 + tracks ) are trying so hard to be unconventional ( which they are ) that they are not always a pleasure to listen to. Others have done similar CD's without trying to break every musical convention and have created more accessible music without compromising themselves or their music.The backing is unconventional and sometimes machine generated. I would rather hear musicians any day and think this detracts from the CD enormously. There are far more accessible CDs in the same genre and I am not sure how often this will get a play.P.S. This is my personal opinion and 2 friends of mine who share a similar musical taste absolutely love it.
5,George B. McClellan,Stephen W. Sears proves once again that he is a master of Civil War histories. A must ead for students of America's greatest conflect.
5,Powerful piano playing!,"I found it especially great to hear him play some of the classic Chopin pieces on this album straight from the musical score without the super smaltzy arrangements. His style and personality still come through clearly, and he is, as always, very entertaining and compelling in his performance."
4,"A significant addition to the literature, but beware!","I found this book to be well worth reading. The editorial reviews accurately describe the contents. Many of the events documented by newspaper and photographs must be brought to our attention to remind us that patterns of settlement don't just happen. I must, however, admit to a certain queasiness about some of the ""factual"" material. Although Mr. Loewen acknowledges that there is a dearth of written material about sundown towns, he does not finally hesitate to designate a town as such based solely upon census records showing either no African Americans or a declining number of African Americans. Additionally, I have some doubts about the accuracy of the quoted memories about the town in which I grew up and spent many years. The ""fact"" that police met trains to warn away unwary black people stikes me as highly unlikely, to say the least. I think that it is always wise to be skeptical about otherwise undocumented recollections."
5,Great book for my Library!,"I do Antique Restoration and Repair work, and often do more common, less valued pieces for my clients also as a result of my skills. Its good to know all I can when it comes to tackling all kinds of repairs, and this book covers many different approaches to gluing with different products and methods. Very handy resource for my business. Thanks."
4,"Quite Informative, but it's not really music.","This album taught a lot of intresting things about synthetic compostion, but at it's heart, all it consists of is Wendy Carlos describing the ""Secrets of Synthesis"" and using small music clips to accentuate her points. If that doesn't sound like it will interest you, then I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Not a turtle,"Two old school aircraft types, though upgraded with modern FMS and GPS. Cockpit and cabin flight views. Great scenery. Interesting airports whose runways sometimes seem to drop off into empty space. And spectacular scenery. You get the Andes on one side of each flight, peaks that look as though they are so high they are a menace to navigation (and some of which are clearly volcanic), and then ocean, beach, and sand on the other end at the islands. Good cock[it presentation on the 737-200, but not on the 727.The only negative is that much of the cockpit chatter and a lot of the ATC chatter is in Spanish, so you may have trouble following it."
5,Good network cable,I bought it for my kids Xbox to connect to the internet.It is more than long enough to go almost anywhere in a 4 bedroom house. Shipping was quick .Also Amazon has the best price around for a 100foot cable.It works and no lag time as compared to a wireless xbox connection.
2,Pilsner Glasses,Breaks way too easy - not worth the cost for the set. Have only had for a few weeks and already down to 3 and just through normal use.
4,A Brief and Insightful Read,"Betty Lundsted succinctly shares her knowledge, thoughts, experiences, perceptions and feelings without one speck of high-faluting terminology or mumbo jumbo, which seems to pepper the pages of many astrology books I've read over the years.I consistently refer to Betty's little gem of a book, which has been most helpful to me on my journey.I believe Betty is a gifted astrologer with an amazing grasp of the genre.Ultimately, I adore her down-to-earth style and wanted more, more, more!Thank you, Betty."
4,Too Short,I try to get my hands on anything about Joan of Arc to read. This book although written for young adults was very informative and an easy read. I only wish it had been longer.
4,Bureaucracy Run Amuck,"I read this excellent book in preparation for my first trip to Glacier and Yellowstone. From page one, I was mesmerized. Nothing could have torn this book from me. After Grizzlies, I read everything I could find on bears. I also returned from Montana with ten copies and assigned them to my staff to read. Why? Because this is a classic tale of bureaucracy run amuck. I am a conservationist, a naturalist and a lover of wildlife. But I am also a manager of a large operation with many employees. Grizzlies taught me I must always pay attention - always watch for the danger signs - listen to what people are telling me. Not that I must manage in fear, but that there are always signs of impending disaster. We can avoid that disaster if we pay attention. This point was clearly and brilliantly made in 1997 by Gavin DeBecker in Gift of Fear. I recommend it too."
4,screenwriting secrets easy to read,The book contained lots of great ideas for writing a better script. Hollywood should read this book again!
3,"OK, but there are better versions","Perahia is much better suited for Mozart, Schubert and other pieces which do not demand strong playing. He clearly has superb technique though I'm not crazy about his dynamics and interpretations.For a strong version, try Pollini with Berlin Orch or Kempf"
1,Hate it!,Way to far out for my traditional taste as far as Christmas Books go.I found many of the ideas in this book outlandish and having absolutely nothing to do with Christmas.
3,It's not about Christmas and only 20 min long,"The case say 60 minutes long. The actual segment relating to Christmas is only 20 minutes long and only talks about Harod. Ray Vander Laan's audio tapes are much better- not scripted, faster moving, and packed with historical/cultural information."
5,This is the BEST!,I am huge fan of snowboard movies in general and this one was a great choice for release on the PSP. Travis Rice is amazing and they do a great job of transitioning from one segment to the next. I liked the Alaska segment the best.
2,Did not help smell,"We bought this pail for our first son. It was easy to use and easy to load new bags. It was also great that it just used regular kitchen trash bags. However, it did not contain the smell of diapers hardly at all. You could walk into his room and smell the diaper pail. Would recommend trying a different type."
4,Refill Discs Can be Found at....,"You can get the refill discs at Babies R Us, I just bought several packs. Just ask if you don't see them, I did and was directed right to them.This diaper pail does not keep all odors out, but it is easier to use than the Diaper Genie and uses standard garbage bags. I would suggest using Glad Odor Shield garbage bags, they do seem to help a little. I usually change bags twice a week, even if the bag isn't completely full."
4,Better than Diaper Gene,"We got this pail about 3 or 4 months ago. Even when we weren't using the deodorizing chip, this pail kept the smells in the pail better than the diaper gene (my husband didn't know there was a deodorizing chip) we use to have. My daughter is 18 months old and has some smelly diapers. The only lesson learned was don't use cheap trash bags, they tear easily when removing the bag from the pail."
2,You get what you pay for ...,"When my baby was soley nursing this pail worked well, but as the solid foods took over - so did the stench. It is the cheapest ""odor free pail"" I've seen, uses regular trash bags and it works well for what it is. But, I've found the only way to keep the smell out of the nursery is to remove the pail, or change the bag every day (as if that will happen.) I believe if I had followed the instructions to ""twist"" the top to seal off each diaper it would work better, but I'm too lazy, and I've found the bag usually untwists anyway. My other problem is that the springs and plastic contraption inside pop apart all the time, so I've lost half the springs. I've decided to invest in a more expensive pail and use this one as my kitchen garbage. (It works well keeping little hands out of the garbage.) My advice, spend a little more money and you'll be happier in the long run."
1,Not Satisfied,"I was initially pleased with my purchase, and felt the diaper pail was functional for all sizes of diapers and met it's claim of being ""odorless."" However, over a couple of months time, the deodrant disc did not provide any deodrizing effect, and other discs that I have purchased are worthless. This is my major complaint. I also have had repeated problems with a metal ""wing"" on the hinged area of the lid opening where the diapers are entered through. I am needing to put this together almost every time I change bags."
1,This pail STINKS,"I hated that this diaper pail smelled all the time. I suffered with it for 6 months, then I discovered the Diaper Dekor. I suggest spending the extra money for the Diaper Dekor it does not smell at all."
2,Not worth it.,"I also purchased this pail hoping to avoid the cost of refills. Unfortunately one day I walked into the babies room and it just reeked of his diapers. He's not on solid food yet. The odor disc doesn't seem to be good for anything but making a rattling noise in the middle of the night, and the spring loaded mechanism doesn't close all the way if the bag gets bunched up at all. We are now looking into a different pail."
3,Not a long term solution!,"Shortly after we started using the diaper pail, the lid kept popping up and wouldn't stay closed. This wasn't a problem for awhile because the &quot;deoderizing&quot; chip in the lid masked odors, and my breastfeeding son's diapers weren't that bad. Then he started on solids and now our nursery, to be blunt, smells like poop. With the lid not staying shut, the odor escapes, and the deoderizing chip no longer deoderizes. (I looked into buying one of these chips separately, and it is not possible.) If you're looking for something to get you through the first few months, it will work just fine. It's a snap to change(just uses regular garbage bags) but once your baby is on solids, it just won't cut it anymore. We are now shopping for a new pail."
3,Not odorless,"We have used this safety 1st diaper pail for 13 months now. The ease of use and the fact that it uses standard kitchen size bags is a plus. The odor still comes through and often fills the room. We are currently looking for another solution. I do not recommend this product, spend a few dollars more and buy something that actually keeps the odor inside."
2,"Not really odor-less, or child proof","This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink.And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail.The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken."
1,DON'T BOTHER,I had a number of problems with this diaper pail. First: Smells were evident right away. Second: I had to push the diapers throught the top with my hand. Third: It doesn't fit anywhere coveniently. Finally: The spring for the interior mechanism kept detaching so it didn't work properly and I constantly had to undo the top and fix the inner workings.
2,I Wish I'd Bought a Different One,"This diaper pail has a lot of negative qualities. (1)It doesn't hold very many diapers. (2)The springs break on me all the time. (3)It stinks.It is good in that it uses regular trash liners, but.....I wish I'd bought a different one in the beginning. Now I'm going to have to try a different brand.:("
2,Not up to par!,"Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided.Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down. If the smell isn't a problem for you, go for it. But if you're picky with the smell, research something else."
4,This is a great diaper pail,"I really like this diaper pail. It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless. As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper. I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery. There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky. This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors. It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor. It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money. It isn't very expensive to begin with."
1,Odor-More,"I bought this product to save alittle money and boy, was THAT a mistake. In just a few hours, this pail would stink up my daughter's room. Don't bother buying this product. Get the diaper genie. Too bad I could rate this product in the negative numbers.Very disappointed!!"
3,What you should do...,"I have not bought this item but I am a mother of a four year old and helped out in a children's second hand store. For any diaper pail you have to dump the solids in the toilet. That will help reduce the smells coming out. Just a suggestion. I used cloth diapers for most of my child's early life and if that is what you are planning on using then you might try putting some of a vinegar water solution in the bottom of the pail,and when washing the pail try some simple green. Simple green is GREAT stuff for cleaning up kids items. Good Luck!"
3,Not that bad...,"I bought this pail instead of the diaper geenie and I am pretty satisfied...let's face it, for the price what do you expect. It worked problem free for the first 6 months than the spring kept popping out every so often, but that was easy to pop back in. Once my daughter was on solids, the smell did get out of hand, but using deoderized garbage bags and tying the pooh-pooh diapers in a plastic grocery bag before disposing did the trick. Also washing it out every weekend with a little bleach helped. There is no completely smell free diaper pail on the marked so don't go broke trying to find one, with proper care, this one will do the job. Also using the toilet deoderizers is a good idea worth trying...thanks for the tip!"
1,Wate of Money,"I received this as a baby shower gift and needless to say it broke before the month was over.The latch sticks, then no longer works and stays completley open exposing you to the full odor, this puppy went in the trash right away.Save your money and get another product"
4,Nice diaper pail,This is a nice little pail. It uses regular trash bags and it does a nice job of blocking out the odors. It also is very inexpensive.
4,picnic table,The picnic table is sturdy and durable. The cardboard wrapping it was delivered in was all mangled and the table top was dented in two places. Also there were little or no instructions on assembly.
4,nice tables,"shipped fast and the product is just what i hoped for but the package was very poor it was coming apart as we tried to move it and it had a few dents and scrach as if it was lifted by a fork lift and dropped that would explain the box all messed up but its livable but can,t be bothered to send it bank because we put it together and it looks okay."
4,Enjoyed this Danielle Steel,"I have been reading Danielle Steel's books for over 15 years now. Sometimes they do get a bit ""all the same"" with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in ""stately homes"" and wear ""important jewels and furs"". Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written.This story is involved around the fashion industry which I found really interesting. I didn't think it was as bad as some other reviewers thought (have they read ""The Klone and I"" I wonder - that's her worst book by far). If you are a Danielle Steel fan you will enjoy this one."
3,ok book,"Used with three other books for class on the black child. book was ok, others were better...a little boring."
3,decent,"bought this watch in switzerland, only problem is that one of the pins holding the bracelt together get loose and every one or two weeks i'll have to fix it...other than that i've actually gotten a lot of compliments about the watch, and would still recomend it.."
4,A perfect fit,"I installed these myself on my 97 LS400 and the installation was pretty easy. The connectors were facing opposite directions, and the manufacturer advised me to rotate the body 180 degrees clockwise (basically, you don't want to unscrew the connector on the shaft while rotating the body.) I asked the manufacturer because Lexus states not to rotate OEM lifts, as they will fly apart. So I wanted to make sure it was okay.They work really well, and after lifting the hood a short amount they will lift the hood on their own. Hopefully they'll last a long time.They lose a star for not having the shaft oriented the correct way and for not having instructions that cover this possibility."
5,Fast Service,The items (2) were delivered within three days of ordering. They arrived as described in record time.
5,Best mug ever made!,"I've been drinking my coffee and tea exclusively from these cups ever since I bought one many years ago. Occasionally I knock one off the counter onto my stone floors, or some such, and they crack, and I head right back online and get several more.I have never found dripping to be a problem, like another reviewer. Sometimes, however, if you overfill, liquid can get trapped in the rubber sealing threads when you put the lid down, and you can get some dribbling. But otherwise, they're perfect."
1,Purchaged by mistake,"Yes, I am Abu Alam. I did not know that this does not have audio with it. So I do not use it."
4,A good read,"I also stayed up until 3 AM to finish this very enjoyable book. Nichols writes about his nautical journey with a wry humor, and his personal one with a fine honesty and lack of self-indulgence. By the end of the book you're just about as attached to Toad as he is, and sad to see her go.As someone who has recently taken up sailing, I also found his writing on techniques and attitudes of sailing and cruising to be interesting, quite apart from the very enjoyable vicarious journey itself.Finally, he makes reference in his tale to other authors who sound like a good read in their own right. Can you ask more of an author than to write a good book and give you ideas for your next readings? Borges would be proud."
4,A thoroughly engrossing personal memoir,"Here's a man who distains the daily grind, fills an engineless sailboat with books by his seafaring heroes, and sets out solo across the Atlantic, navigating by sextant, and listening to the BBC World Service on short-wave radio. He thinks about the past, tells tales of ocean races, studies photographs of skies for weather warning, meets an Azorean scrimshaw artist, and much, much more. This man writes well, is perceptive and intelligent, and confronts his troubles honestly and simply. Got to go now, my sailboat is gathering moss and mildew at the back of the garden; ""I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied."" (John Masefield)"
5,Beethoven the fantastic.,I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this CD. It is fantastic. Beethoven is wonderful and could not be played by two more proficient artists. It is a must have for any music library!Beethoven: Complete Sonatas for Piano & Cello
3,"Close, but no cigar...","Well we finally ""bit the bullet"" and ordered a burr coffee grinder from Amazon. We decided to get some of this coffee to start out our home grinding experience. Yesterday morning, the mailman arrived with our package. We have brewed 4 pots so far.First, no complaints about the caffeine. You can get quite a buzz on a couple of cups. And the beans are beautiful.It is not bitter or acidic - it's nice & smooth. I was disappointed with the the almost total lack of the wonderful aroma noted by other reviewers, though. It just seems to lack any outstanding flavor or character. Tastes similar to many better grocery store blends I have used in the past. Although my wife liked it better than I did, when asked if she would buy it again - she said: ""Probably not.""I'm not encouraged to try any of their other blends based on this experience. We will probably stick with Howe's, which is sold at our grocer. At least you can smell it before buying.Maybe my expectations were just too high."
1,AMAZON DOESN'T FULFILL,"I ordered two copies of ""La Resistencia"" on November 1st and last week I still had no news regarding this order.I had to contact Amazon via telephone, only to be informed by customer service that AMAZON was not going to send me the book.When I asked for a date when Amazon was going to tell me this, they had no answer for me, none at all.I find this to be very irresponsible and rude, that they were never going to tell me that they cancelled my order without mi consent, without my authorization and without informing me about it.And no apology was given to me. The girl that answered the phone only told me that Amazon had cancelled the order and that if I needed something else.And as of today I haven't yet received an e-mail from Amazon letting me know that the decided not to send me the book, or at least apologizing for the inconvenience"
1,Don't let the price fool you,"This battery was used. The product info made no mention of this. It will not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. If this company makes it's business of selling useless products, my question is why are they still in business?DO NOT BUY THIS PRUDUCT!!!"
5,Everything I was hoping for.....,"This is an excellent product. It was very easy to ""install"" - really nothing more complicated than inserting batteries (included) and pressing a connect button on the mouse and keyboard. They are both very comfortable and intuitive. I had been using Mac's cordless keyboard and mouse but find that these are much nicer - especially since I use a PC at work and it makes transitioning at home to my Mac feel more seemless."
4,Good with workarounds,"I'm generally pleased with the consistent performance of this keyboard/mouse combo. It is the best wireless setup I've used (although that isn't saying a *whole* lot -- I've only used a few, and they've all been poor).The issues I work around:- I have to adjust tracking speed every time the OS boots- The keyboard is a bit ""klunky""... my typing isn't as smooth as it was with the stock Mac keyboard- USB slot is occupied by proprietary antenna (onboard Bluetooth does not work)"
4,"Works great, but quality seems to be fading","I've been using this keyboard and mouse for two years and I find it very comfortable and well designed.But after two years, it seems like the wireless is deteriorating. I have to move the USB base closer and closer to the mouse and keyboard. The only design flaw I found is the existence of the mouse wheel tilt clicks. I don't use these, but find that their existence makes the wheel click (which I do use) have a firmer resistance. A mild annoyance on an otherwise great product."
1,NO Functionality,"OK, the keyboard does work, the mouse does work, the bluetooth does work. That's great, BUT NONE of the Apple specific keys work with the latest version of OS10....Including the Apple key!! What is even worse is if you go the the Logitech website, they are aware of the issues and offer absolutely no solution or timeframe when they will have things updated.If you are looking only for a keyboard, and don't care about the Apple or shortcut keys working, then buy this. Otherwise, go for the true Apple keyboard that you will know works"
4,Great keyboard but software kind of sucks,Nice keyboard with pretty good feedbacks from the keys. I agree with other posts regarding its software and it is kind of flakey. It's best to check Logitech's website for most updated software/driver.
2,"Decent hardware, laughable software, sad technical support","This desktop set is pretty nice looking but thats about it. The layout is awkward to make room for the media keys on either side. The printing on the keys themselves looks pretty bad-too bold and too small. Some keys wobble more than they should as well. A bit loud when typing fast, but acceptable. The driver software provided by Logitech is inexcusably bad. Crashes too often to make use of the configuration utility. If you actually have the patience to finally customize your mouse buttons and keyboard media keys the software confuses, ignores or forgets many of your selections. Forget about having unique actions tasked to each button for different applications either. Logitech's software can't remember what key was assigned to what application. Tech support had no one to help a Mac user at the time I called. Very disappointed."
4,Very satisfied,"I was pleasanty satisfied with the book. I only wish that it had come with the cd, but other than that, it was in excellent shape and couldn't beat the price. Thank you!"
5,Good book on anothet trendy and false mental disorder:,"There is no such thing as MPD, but it certainly was a fad in the 1980s, after a few imaginative sorts came up with yet another way to escape punishment for their crimes.Ross Michael Carlson did kill his parents. As one of the policemen said, they thought that it was a case of religious toxicity. Poor kid, how he suffered."
4,Good Fortune Predicted for This Book,"I don't know how she does it, but Ms. Myers has written yet another truly entertaining book in this - her 5th in her Penn/Dutch mystery series. Her new marriage ends in this one, which is an important reason to read these in order (so why doesn't the publisher put the Number on them?). Each page is engaging; her writing and wit superb. However in this book I found it to be somewhat weak in plot (that's why the 4 stars). The book is not a disappointment, though, as she carries it thru with her unique sense of humor and just plain talent. Don't miss it!"
2,Magdalena Deputized!,"As in the other books in this series, this book is really thin in the plot area, and in this one the motive for the killing is not plausible, but it's still a funny story in it's own way. Readers must be die-hard cozy fans to enjoy this series, and they must be willing to give the author a lot of latitude since Ms. Myers really needs an editor for her books. This book is about what appears to be a hit-and-run murder, and at first glance it looks like it might be local Amish boys that did it. That is why Melvin Stoltzfus deputises Magdalena to help him solve the mystery. I'm really not sure about this series. Each book seems more disjointed than the last one, and they make less and less sense. But I do finish the books, even though it seems like an almost guilty pleasure."
1,Disappointing Customer Service,I purchased a Performax 16-32 from Amazon and now need a part. I called the telephone number in the manual and reached WMH Tool Group. The circuit breaker that protects the drum motor is bad on my tool. I was told by WMH Tool Group that the circuit breaker was not available by itself and that I would have to buy a new motor at a cost of approximately 1/3 the purchase price of the tool. I have tried to find the circuit breaker on-line from the manufacturer in Taiwan but I have not been successful. It is much easier to replace the circuit breaker than the whole motor and a fraction of the cost. I think it is inexcusable that the circuit breaker is not available and I would never buy another JET Tool.
5,The Best Guide to Opening Your Own Store,"This book is the best guide to opening your own store that I have ever seen - and believe me, I've read most of them! In The Secrets of Retailing, Marc Joseph skips the intellectual theories that make most business books so boring and focuses instead on practical solutions. He shows you how you can live the American Dream by working for yourself - even if Wal-Mart opens up right down the street."
3,"If you're mathematically competent but lazy, get this book!","This book is not a tutorial or self-teaching guide, it's more of a reference book. If you are not familiar with intermediate algebra and trigonometry this book will not be useful to you. But if you know the basic concepts of alg/trig you will find this book useful for that one difficult problem that is in every workset of your textbook. So, if you don't want to spend time concentrating on one problem, you can spend time searching for a similar problem in this book that will get you started on the original problem. But if you need the entire problem worked out with explanations this is not the book for you."
1,the sun ate it,I had this seat cover in the car for one summer and the sun destroyed the weave part. It fell apart like straw. The only thing left was the wood beads and the fishing line. The beads are not wide or long enough to cool you off.
4,Does the Job,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive beaded seat cover that would allow me to ""scoot"" in and out of the driver's seat easier. I just bought a new vehicle that has cloth seats and I found it somewhat cumbersome to slide in and out of the driver's seat. I've been using this seat cover for about a month now and I have no complaints about it! It's durable and comfortable and fits on any sized car seat. I would recommend it."
1,Falls apart,"The title says it all. Inside of three months of moderate use, the plastic edging disintergrated and I had to throw it out."
3,Comfy but fragile,This was given as a gift. I beard that it was very comfortable but that the elastic that secured it to the seat back broke within two days of use. We opted to repair it by hand rather than return it.
3,for completists,"While ""LIVE"" enjoys a dedicated following, it is one of Bill Frisell's weaker and less accessible albums. The earlier part of Bill's discography is uneven. This 1995 recording is no exception. Frisell has always been a guitar visionary. That written, his music didn't really bloom or mature into consistent greatness until the late 1990's. This disc is down there with ""Have a Little Faith"" (1993) and ""Before We Were Born"" (1989). While such recordings are high in artistic integrity, they're just not very 'listenable.' ""LIVE"" is a good album with serious highlights, but with so much phenomenal Frisellian fare out there, this is for completists. The dominant sound on this album is rock meets jazz. If you seek Bill Frisell's jazzy rock (or rockin' jazz), get ""Bill Frisell with Dave Holland and Elvin Jones"" or the Ginger Baker Trio's ""Going Back Home."" If you want live Bill Frisell, go with 2005's ""East/West."""
3,Moisturizing,Maybe it's just my hair type but my hair seems courseand has a build up from the leave in conditioner. Willgo back to rinse outs.
4,My Son Loved It,"Whenever we go to Hawaii with our almost four-year-old son, we try to buy him a topical book there. This one has a fast-paced beat that allows for a quick, yet amusing, read. It also contains some ethical situations that are good for children to learn about in a light-hearted way. The only thing that detracted for me was the plethora of recipes in the back of the book. One smoothie recipe would have sufficed. I thought the rest was gratuitous. But we talked about this book all the way home on the airplane and for days after. Hope you enjoy it!"
3,sturdy protector,"I really like this holster. It offers really great protection and I love the belt clip, too. It's nice not to have to put it in my pocket or carry it in my hand while walking my BIG dog! I am considering ordering a different type however, only because it's kind of 'manly'. I'm looking for a little more 'girly' case that will offer the same protection."
4,30 G Zune Holder,This holder is great protection for my Zune. Would like the belt clip to be more user friendly.
2,Go for the cheapo!,"While this potty worked for my daughter, we weren't overly pleased with it. To empty it, you lift the entire lid & empty the cup inside. If any spills happen from this cup inside the unit itself, it's difficult to clean. The lid doesn't stay on securely over time (designed to be able to fit on regular toilet)Save yourself even more $ by getting the basic model from Baby bjorn. Simple molded plastic, comfortable, one piece, easy to clean. Trust me, when they're ready, they're ready. No special potty is needed."
1,not so good for boys!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this potty for my son to start potty training him. I thought this would have been a good potty. Boy, did I think wrong. My son has only used it twice. The first time he used it, he went to the bathroom all over the floor. The second time he did just fine, but every little move he makes, the sheild always falls off, which was not only frustrating him, but me as well. I wouldn't even waste your money!!!!!"
4,It worked for us,"I bought this because it was cheap and I hate gimicks. My daughter used it fine and didn't have a problem other than getting up on to it by herself, but I think that was only a matter of it's relative height and I think most of the seats were similar in height.I never used the seat only portion on an actual toilet for my daughter, she went from using this to sitting on the big potty using a stepping stool so I can't comment on it's usefulness there.I did notice that it was somewhat of a pain to keep clean, but for the price I felt it was a good value."
1,Do not buy this potty!,"This potty is no good! My 20 month old boy has had more trouble with this potty! The pee guard is useless, the hole is too small, if he lifts up the potty by the handles to carry it the top comes off of the base, the lid falls and hits him on the back as he is trying to sit down, etc. Do not waste your money with this potty! I recommend the Graco soft seat potty and step stool."
1,Not designed well,"We tried....and my daughter who is really taking to potty training keeps getting hit in the back with the seat lid while going. Plus the seat is so light weight, it keeps tipping forward while she tries to get up off the potty. (she isn't a big girl, so it isn't her weight causing the problem) I am looking for another seat tonight."
1,Not Sturdy and Poorly Built,"My twin girls had this thing busted apart the first day I brought it home. The hinges were the first things to break off and because the lid never fit on right, they would fall off when they tried to use it as a step stool. They were getting hurt on it and wouldn't use it as a potty so we threw it out. I bought another one for $10 and it works great and is very sturdy."
2,Uncomfortable,"We bought this seat thinking the side rails, ability to plant feet on the floor, and flexibility to use the seat topper on the ""big potty"" were good features. While it works fine for the standing position, my son (2+yrs) complained almost right away that sitting on it hurt his bottom. He also gets frustrated that the lid won't stay open and taps him on the back when he goes to sit. He resists this seat, but has successfully tried others at relatives and daycare. We are going shopping for a different seat so we can resume potty training at home. NOTE: The Baby Bjorn soft topper met with my son's approval and seems to be the frontrunner. Though it is more expensive, we would have saved money, and possibly expedited potty training, by buying it in the firstplace."
2,Buy another potty!,"This potty is terrible! It was acually the first one I tried, thinking that it looked the best, but looks are decieving! The potty container and seat were so small; I can't see a average size child even sitting on it! It also was such a pain to clean, too many parts. Plus, to convert it into a step stool was so complicated! Take my advice and don't waste you time with this potty; there are better ones out there. Happy training!"
2,Not a great potty...,"I received this potty as a gift for my daughter. We both hate it. The base isn't wider than the top, so it often tips forward when she sits on it. You also have to lift the ""toilet"" seat up to take out the container that actually holds the mess. The only good thing is the conversion to a two step stool. I'm thinking of trying the graco brand."
1,Splash Guard does not stay put,"Maybe this potty would work for a girl, but it is useless for a boy learning to sit to potty. The splash guard comes off with the slightest bump. If the splash guard isnt there then nothing makes it into the potty. I have to hold the splash guard in place until I get a replacement potty!"
1,not for boys,"The flimsy shield falls off as our son tries to sit down on it. He seems to like sitting on the actual seat, but I think this potty would be a better choice for girls."
4,Great on the Potty,"While I admit this potty has some drawbacks as a traditional small potty seat, neither of my children wanted to sit on a small potty anyway, they wanted the ""real"" potty so this product was great for us! The potty seat fits so well (very secure)on the toilet and my kids use the steps to get on the 'big potty'. Both of my children really liked this potty seat and it made potty training so much easier. The kids felt so big and proud that they were using the big toilet and they were so stable and secure on the seat - the handles are a great addition. My only complaint was that the steps needed to be more stable - but I bought mine in '99 so they may have improved since then. I would definitely recommend this product!"
2,Other potty's better,"In-laws have this potty. It is a pain to use. My son is constantly getting hit in the back by the potty top. He tries to open it and if he opens to fast, then it slams shut again.Other difficult part is that you lift the whole blue/green seat part off to get the bowl to clean. It's flimsy, and not well made.The reason it got stars from me is because I have never had it leak, and my son (26 mo) enjoys holding the handles."
4,question,I bought my copy used and wonder if the noise that sounds like the cd is scratched at the end of the last song is supposed to be there. or is it something wrong with my copy?
4,The Only Source for Information about the North,"While this book is short and fails to provide an exhaustive examination, it is the only book I can find that contains any information about spiritual movements in the Northern Army during the Civil War. Sadly, many of the footnotes refer to unpublished dissertations in the Harvard library. To his credit, the author has made a rarely mentioned subject available to a limited degree. I need more and hope to see additional works published to balance all of the works done about revival in the Southern armies during this same period. The whole point is to document that God worked mightily in the North and South during this period. We just need the documentation to get this message out!"
3,Huh?,"Eight years ago, when she was 17, her boyfriend/fiance/lover (never really clear) was sent to prison for killing her father although he was innocent.Since then Lilly has gone to college, graduated from law school, was married to Hugh for two years (not clear on that either),got a divorce, moved to California, got a job in the L.A. District Attorneys office, blown a major case, had a meltdown, was put on leave, moved to a new apartment, worked part time at a suicide hotline and she'd ""hit the peak of her career"". This was all done pretty much consecutively and she couldn't have been more than 26!This wasn't a horrible book but not a good book either. The whole book was disjointed and didn't move along well. I'm not sure I'd try one of her books again."
2,100% Polyester,"I had no idea what microfiber was, but if the add had stated that these pants were made of polyester, I would not have bought them. They are good pants, but I was looking for cotton pants."
2,eh.. i don't know..,"I'm not sure what was wrong with this release, but I didn't like it at all.. I felt that a lot of the music was very dry and repetitive. And it could be because of my taste in techno music. I prefer a ton of melody in my techno, but this to my ears didn't have it. Welcome to the Technodrome 2 was MUCH better, and I love 70% of that release!"
2,Rotten foul odor. Not worth the money,"I also purchased this plant and have quite the green thumb. After not even a week of receiving the plant the beautiful purple flowers died and the plant has this rotten smell to it and is looking dried up and dying. Looks nothing like the picture entails. I'm so sad I wasted the money on this item. I purchased another plant at the same time and it is either dead or dormant after a week as well. A person is better purchasing locally unfortunately so they can show the seller immediately and get the problem resolved. I followed the instructions to the ""tee"""
2,"beautiful, but...","beautiful and well-made, but holding screw (keeping keys on ring) keeps coming loose. thus, keys fall off with great regularity."
2,Same Problem,"After 8 months, threads on nut seem to be stripped and won't stay tight and hold keys on. Trying to figure out if supplier can replace nut."
3,The middle of a story arc always suffers,"This story is the middle of story arc that concludes in the NA ""No Future."" Like all story arcs, there comes a point in the plot were nothing really happens, and that's exactly what happens in ""The Dimension Riders."" The characters are thrown about through time and space (literally), with very little being resolved. If you can find it used, pick it up."
3,I wanted to love this,"I've used the pyrex glass containers with plastic lids for over 10 years, and although they've held up well, I wanted a no-plastic solution for refrigerator food storage.I ordered this from Amazon, despite another review noting that the lids don't fit properly. Yup, they don't. I ordered 2 different sizes, and neither lid fits right, leaving my leftovers to dry out in the fridge. I could put up with that, but the darned things are also so heavy, and I'm not old and weak, but I'm getting tired of the weight of these things, especially when filled with food. The glass is so thick...On the positive side - they are better than plastic (any glass or ceramic container is), they look retro-cool, and they stack well in the fridge.But for me, I'm going back to using my pyrex with the plastic lids (I wash the lids by hand to prevent the plastic from breaking down)."
5,"Excellent, versatile storage","These are excellent storage to cook to table pieces. I put salsa in them to serve and save in frig. I keep granola in them on the counter. I keep peanuts on the bar. They go in microwave, oven, frig but are pretty enough for serving. I have these 2 cup and the 12 cup sizes (the 5 cup looks like a bread loaf pan). Crateand Barrel sells these as does Walmart(for half the cost)."

2,-,"For sixty dollars, I was expecting much more than what I received. Maybe I was just reading the editorial review wrong, but I assumed the collection would be more images than text, and if that's what you're looking for, I recommend you don't buy this collection.I only found one of the books mildly entertaining, the rest will probably end up in the trash before the end of the week. One of the books was an actual calender, which I guess is useful, but not exactly what I was looking to buy for sixty dollars.The editorial review also says something about overdesign. Now if you consider overdesign to mean a big plain silver heart on a red background or a book full of nothing but a word spread between every two pages in different colors and plain fonts as ""overdesign"" then so be it. But I sure don't.Overall, I'm glad I now own that one book in the collection, but if I had to do it over again, I would keep my sixty dollars to buy on something else."
5,"Gift for my boyfriend, he loves it","This is your basic pocket knife, has all the basics plus some cool extra tools too. The pouch is a nice bonus and will go on a belt, or straight on pants without a belt."
5,Oh come now !,"It is very humorous to me that there are those that think someone other than the creator of a great work could conduct it better ! This is the best version period. I heard one version that was very lyrical. It was interesting but not what Stravinsky intended; not what he heard in his head when he wrote it. If you can have only one version of this masterpiece, then you have found it."
2,Worst CD To Nap To. Ever.,"I mean, come on, how on earth are we supposed to get a good classical music nap with all this ruckus? And what's with the cover? How deaf is that old man that he can't hear all that noise going on? Crash, Boom Boom, Whap, Sproing, Wonk. For pity's sake. Give us a few bars we can snooze through, please? That opening bassoon in the super high register is a nice start, almost a tease, but after that, you're on your own. No rest here.Robert Lewis"
2,So-so,"This book wasn't all that I thought it was. It was a classic story with a ""I-don't-know-if-it-should-be-called-an-ending"" story.It's about a girl who lives with her mother and has to move to Edmonton. When she finds pictures and belongings of her long lost father. She builds a fantasy around the memory of her father, that he was some kind of a hero, until she learns the truth. It's very ho-hum and I expected more from Monica Hughes."
4,Jay Dee is NICE!!!!!,"Okay the rhymes are not the illest but the man gets his point across. His beats are the incredible. He makes a little boombox turn into a 5 star multi-rack system!!!! Man, he has got to be one the best producers in Hip-Hop right now!!!!! Get this album!!! That is all I got to say. If you are into production, this Beat Generation CD is for you!!!!! That's it!!!I'm out!!!!"
5,"I agree with everyone else, amazing work","Originality and your own style, the attributes all producers and rappers go for. This album is true Jay Dee style. I would even go so far as a new sub genre. The beats are so smooth and flow with a subtleness, but amazingly the tempo of each song is different, the beats retain they're character but vary from song to song, thats just pure brilliance. This focus on beats hasn't effected the rapping either, a lot deeper but less undertone meaning than the rhymes from Slum Village 1 & 2. Some great artists that never really hit the big time, but are worth their weight in gold such as Elzhi and Beej have done a good job also. Buy it if you would like to hear Slum's work with a touch more variety."
1,Chase This One Away,"I found this book to be fraught with factual errors, and was most notable for the omissions of inconvenient facts. This book is intended to give us the picture of a gentleman who is a moderate, and a voice of reason against eco-terror, but instead what I found was a thinly disguised argument in favor of clear cutting - but the author cannot even remain consistent with that argument, as most of his examples of sustainable systems are drawn from areas where selective cutting has been practiced. Many of the misrepresentations that are evident here are easy to spot if you are willing to research the vast array of literature available on this subject, but the majority of his audience is not going to be able to take the sort of time to thoroughly research both sides of the question. Don't waste your time."
5,Wow,"Billy Gilman is extremely talented. Though he doesn't write his own music which often turns me away from an artist, he is only 12 and has a way to go to reach his potential. The messages he sends are powerful, he may not understand some of what he sings but he can sure make you think he does. With songs like ""What's Forever For"" and ""Spend Another Night"" he convays a message of love with one of the best singing voices around. In his hit single ""One Voice"" he tells of a story about a kid witnessing things that trouble him and how he sees god not helping, but one day coming home he sees a kid dispose of a gun in a river after school and he knows that god is helping. With a message like that what possibley can make you not want this cd?"
4,... and he's only 12?,"Before I get into this ... keep in mind that Billy is 12 - and I'm 31 (soon to be 32) so I'd never heard about this kid until I was flipping by some videos a week ago and caught the last verse of ""One Voice"". I knew that I'd have to get the whole CD.Ok ... so it's a little odd hearing ""little"" Billy Gilman singing about love - and if you can't get past that while you're listening to ""I Think She Likes Me"" or ""Spend Another Night"", you may not like this CD.But, before you give up, you really owe it to yourself to listen to the energy he puts into ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" and the feeling in ""One Voice"" ... or some of the notes he hits on ""The Snake Song"". (Wonder if he's gonna be able to still do that in a few years?)All in all ... if he sounds this great at 12, I can only imagine how incredible his voice will be at 24!Quite a talent ... he should be very proud of this effort!"
1,A real waste of time,"I am actually dumber for reading this. The writing is awful, and Hirsen spends most of his time beating the horses that someone else killed. (He couldn't put together a strong enough argument to inflict much damage on his own.)If this is a subject you have any interest in, I'd suggest Neil Postman's ""Amusing Ourselves to Death."" The book is a bit dated, but still a powerful, engaging read."
1,A Great Disappointment,"This is not a scholarly work, and not truly a biography (although it does have an elementary review of personal details about Sharon). The presentation is a flat monotone with no attention to relative importance of events discussed. It's as if the authors had daily news bulletins spread out before them, and then give us a synopsis. There is no analysis of significance and import of the events, or background explanation of Israeli and Palestinian personalities, politics or issues. What commentary that is given is by way of quotations (or paraphrases) of recognized authorities in the field, and often this material is without source attribution. Unless the reader has some significant prior understanding of the Israeli/Palestinian situation, much of the book will be confusing and of low informative value."
1,Shame on you Mr Shandling,"Do NOT waste money on this bad, bad book. I did and it is the most dissapointing book I have ever read. Very poor effort indeed."
2,Odd,"How could this work? What made the Larry Sanders show funny was it's cutting satire in allowing us to see the flip side of Hollywood. This book, as it is designed, could only let us see the phoney side with none of the backstage & behind-the-scenes hilarity that made the show what it was. The result is a puzzling product that will rightfully fade away while the memory of the fantastic show remains fresh."
4,Great chair for traveling!,"I can't imagine not having this chair!! We keep it in the trunk of our car and it has been incredibly useful MANY times! It makes going to family and friends' homes that don't have highchairs a much easier visit!! We like the fact that the seat of the chair can be flipped over...giving two height options.There are only two 'not-so-good' things that I can think of: 1)the armrests of the chair are a little high for a few tables that we've encountered, making it impossible to push the chair up to the table and 2)the tray can be a little difficult to adjust smoothly...but nothing too bad.All in all...we love this chair!!"
1,Parents of Active Babies Beware,"My husband and I thought this booster seat was a great choice because of the obvious small size and convenience. However, our son is very active and is constantly on the move. We could never get the booster seat strapped to any chair tight enough to keep it from sliding around. One evening, our son managed to throw himself off balance by rocking in his booster seat as we sat near him. The chair he was in fell forward, and he landed on his mouth on the floor. He lost his first tooth that night and had his first trip to the emergency room. Unless you have a very docile child, do not trust a booster seat. Invest in a real highchair, sacrifice the space and convenience and put your child's safety first!!"
1,Tray is awful,"I purchased this item 3 days ago and it is going back!! The overall quality of the seat is okay, but if you plan on using the tray it is awful!! I placed my 11 month old daughter in this and was unable to get the one side of the tray to fully latch. Well after I finally got this thing to fully latch guess what.......I couldn't get it to unlatch to get her out. The tray slides on and off REAL hard and the levers for the latch are small which make it hard to pull on them. I have an older model of the same chair which is probably 6 years old and love it, but the new and approved is WORTHLESS!! So back to the store this one will go and I will look for something different."
2,great for grandparents house,"My son needed a chair to sit in otherwise he would not eat, so I bought this chair when we were visiting the grandparents. The chair is adequate but unless I pick a faulty one I find the tray very difficult to get on and off, the plactic levers are very small for those with arthritis. I don't know if there are any chairs that are better."
2,Ehhh,"I'm not impressed. My baby is only 7 mo old and it is cumbersome to get him into this seat. Other revewiers are correct when they say that the green portion of the seat it much, MUCH larger and it takes up half of that open space where the legs go. I wish it was more like the picture shown because then my baby would have had no issues fiting. I don't see how this will fit a baby at 16mo like it states. The ""toys"" on top are a bit hard with a very pointy and unfriendly way about them. I don't want my baby chewing on them. The product would have been next to perfect tho if it weren't for the green portion of the seat taking up too much space. UPDATE THE PICTURE!!!!"
2,its ok,"I like this chair but it does move a lot in the bathtub when baby moves around the chair tilts a little. for the price, I dont recommend it."
