5,the tape is great,tape met my expectationsDoes not stick well if tape is cold.But it says the glue is heat activated so...Would recomend to others.
2,No stick if you sweat,"Dear next consumer,I researched kinesio tape for 2 weeks before making a purchase. I settled on this one after reading its reviews. If you are an athlete who sweats when you work out, then this is not the product for you. I have an outdoor job, and after taping my arm for ""golfer's elbow"" the tape only lasted for approx. 1 hour. I am disappointed to say the least.Good luck"
1,"""New"" version of Kinesiotape?","I don't know if I got a bad batch or if the manufacturer changed something, but the tape doesn't stick beyond 20 minutes or so, vs 4- days. This totally defeats the purpose of the tape and makes it absolutely worthless. I'm glad I only ordered 2 boxes. I don't feel like it's worth the effort of trying to get my money back, but the tape totally didn't work like the previous orders we used for years, from a different supplier."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I found this product useful in treating minor overuse injuries in my feet and legs. It certainly seems like it helps improve recovery time and aids injured areas. It stays on fairly well--you can shower, swim, and even apply ice cups right over it. However, it's not a miracle, and it's not an instant fix. Remember, each application is supposed to stay on for about 5 days. If you have a serious injury, it's not going to allow you to compete injury-free, nor will it cure a long-lasting chronic injury permanently. It is a very good recovery aid, but you still have to address the cause of your original injury. I have less experience using kinesio tape on acute injuries (sprains, bruises, and the like) since my sport (distance running) involves relatively few, so I can't comment on the manufacturer's claim that it can reduce swelling and edema."
5,Well worth the investment,"This tape is an athlete's best friend. It should never be confused with cloth medical tape. You actually can do more with less. If its good for Olympic athlete's, you'll love it."
3,Kinesio tape,"After two weeks of constant wear, I'm not feeling any difference. Maybe this isn't long enough."
5,Kinesio Tex Tape,This is a great product. I have been using it to relieve pain from plantar faciitis. It works and truly is water resistant.
1,NO DELIVERY,"I have had this product used on my leg multiple times by my PT and would swear by it for reducing swelling, however, apparently I need to order it elsewhere since Amazon can't seem to get it shipped to me. I ordered this on the 13th of December and here it is the 23rd of December and still no tape and they can't tell me where it is. I'm done with Amazon!!!!"
4,Good price for standard product of it's type,"Use to tape a shoulder, works well, stays on for at least 5 days. Would recommend, but need to use it longer to see if the adhesive is as good as others."
3,I think I'm allergic to it,"I tried the tape on my shoulder/neck area and left in on overnight. By the next morning, I had blisters along the edges of the tape. When I removed the tape, the blisters formed a red line that showed the outline of where the tape had been. I have had some problems with rashes from adhesives before but was surprised by how big these blisters were. I like the tape itself and am able to use it on my foot without any problems so far. Just caution to anyone that has sensitivity to adhesive to buy only one roll until you see if you will be able to use it.M in Colorado"
5,It works good,My therapist used this for me every time I visited. It works amazing. It s popular for any sport when needed. I have seen in 2012 summer Olympic.
3,Ok,This is a product recommended by my therapist but it does not last more than 12 hours. I found myself going thru the roll very quickly; not sure it's worth the price.
3,Not An Alternative to a Brace,"I haven't used other brands of tape, so I don't know if it's this particular one, or all of them in general, but I was somewhat disappointed. My doctor recommended I try kineseo tape as an alternative to a brace for severe carpal tunnel in my hand/wrist, so I gave it a shot. The second it gets wet (or rubs on your clothing for a few hours), it will un-stick and peel off with the ends fraying terribly and collecting every possible hair/lint/dust particle within breathing distance.That said - before it's wet, it works REALLY well, with just the right amount of stretch and support. So if you don't plan on washing your hands or showering for a few days, or if you're just using it for sports, this may be for you - it was super effective when freshly applied and dry. As an alternative to a daily/nightly brace, I wouldn't recommend because removing the old and re-applying each day ends up being a somewhat temporary and expensive solution."
2,Meh,"This product didn't really do much for me. I bought it because everyone uses kinesio tapes on the olympics. I thought it might help my plantar, but didn't ."
5,kinesio tape,I have used this tape for my mother for 3 yrs and I am so happy that I am able to purchase it online-works wonders for her!!!!
3,Heavenly Bodies,"First off all, let me start off by saying that this isn't a terrible movie like said by some. I will say that it does have a fairly weak storyline and that some of the lines don't help much either. But fine performances (most notably from Cynthia Dale) and some good moments of humour, romance and feel-good fun help this to become a pretty good movie. Dale plays Samantha Blair, a woman who is tired of office work, and decides to open up an exercise gym where aerobics is the thing they practice most often. When they are threatened to be closed down and sold, the staff and members of the gym decide to face the club buying them out and compete in a dancing marathon. Some interesting camera work, sexy 80s costumes and a nice little rock music score also add to the overall cool feel of this little-known ""Flashdance"" similarity."
2,Not impressed. Directions says to make a slurry,"Not impressed with the flavor.There are others with much better flavor.The grind is very very small.It may be okay for soups and stews but too powdery for sprinkling onto anything solid like a rub.In fact the directions says to mix with the broth of what you plan on adding it to first.I will probably use what I have for a brining solution for pork and chicken, along with salt and sugar."
2,Unsatisfying,"Dead bodies are inexplicable moving around the London area, and Scotland Yard is on the case.Mixing mystery with science, the book ultimately leaves much unexplained. It makes use of the statistical analysis and the scientific method in the earlier chapters. Then intuition, and latching onto the 'possible but unlikely' in the later chapters. The moral is 'some events don't have a conventionally scientific explanation, but life goes on'.An unsatisfying novel which takes great mental energy as the reader attempts to use the multitude of details to puzzle out the case. The book is dense and rich in minutiae, for example pages 151-155 are a single paragraph.Only read if you love both mysteries and unexplained phenomena, want something different, and don't mind half-hearted resolutions. Reminded me of reading Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""House of the Seven Gables""."
2,Would be allright in its proper place,"The blurb says ""The essential buyer's guide for the DIY or trade renovator, woodworker and student"" and this is fairly accurate, although the ""essential"" will only be true for a limited group of users. This booklet is a pocket guide bringing together basic terms and names: information offered is quite limited, mostly just enough for a quick check on the basics.This is quite a modest booklet, illustrated with a few black & white photographs and a few drawings. I have been given free booklets for promotional purposes that looked better than this, and thirty dollars is wildly overpriced. The claim that this is ""the most comprehesive guide to the Australian retail timber market"" is incomprehensible, since this book reaches only to kneeheight when compared to the book by Keith R. Bootle.Still, a pretty decent booklet, that might be quite useful in the right dashboard compartment."
4,Disappointing,"Tamia's voice is stronger on the slow ballads. Sounds like she's screaming on the faster, hip-hop sounding tunes. I'd love to see her in a small, intimate supper club; she's not ready for the big stadium/arena."
4,TALENTED AND GIFTED,"I THINK THE CD IS JUST WONDERFUL. TAMIA WAS A GREAT FIND BY QUINCY JONES. SHE HAS SHOWN HER TRUE TALENT BUT SHE IS NOT GIVEN HER JUST REWARDS IN THIS INDUSTRY. TAMIA IS OVERLOOKED JUST LIKE CHANTE MOORE, OLETA ADAMS AND SEVERAL OTHERS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TAMIA."
4,"Not groundbreaking, but well done","Tamia's self-titled debut is a smooth collection of soul-pop songs. Musically, the album isn't too different from much of the contemporary R&B flooding the marketplace today, but it is well-crafted and performed. Tamia is an undeniably talented singer. Whether reaching deep into her register on ""Rain On Me,"" or soaring passionately on ""You Put A Move On My Heart,"" her voice never fails to mesmerize. However, like Whitney Houston, Tamia has a tendency toward vocal gymnastics, and sometimes over-embellishes what is better left simple. But since she has such a good voice, this is a minor fault, not a major one. Likewise, though several of the album's songs are mediocre, Quincy Jones' immaculate production and Tamia's stunning vocals usually conceal this weakness from the casual listener. All in all, this album is a solid start to her career."
4,the beginning,"This is not one of the best rnb record that I've heard. They are not the best songs but Tamia's voice is lovely, one of the better voices in the industry. Buy itÂ¡"
1,Dumbest story I've ever read,"This book rates a ""1"" because .2 was not an option on Amazon's scale.The book's title is a misnomer leading to great disappointment for anyone hoping to read about the Snake River. Billed as ""historical novel,"" these words rely on name dropping of only two historical figures as very minor characters in this story.Missing a great opportunity to tell of dangers and adventures (geographic, social and political) faced by pioneers traversing the Oregon Trail, the author studiously avoided anything exciting and/or intellectual.Stuffed with comic-book cliches, and romances with predictable misunderstandings and resolutions the reader is caused to discard this writing as the work of a frustrated student of English 101 who prays the prof. will at least count the number of words as worthy of a ""C"".This is a real page-burner."
4,Great Food,This is a great food for any Lab. The pieces are big and makes them chew the food rather than just swallow it. I buy this at Petsmart ($50.99) as it is cheaper than Petco (53.99). The shipping costs to order from Amazon ($22) basically makes buying it in the store cheaper.
4,Music for Egyptian dance,"Mohktar Al Said has worked as a musical director and composed pieces for famous Egyptian dancers such as Fifi Abdo and Dina. This CD is a collection of dance compositions played in the modern classical, and baladi (country) styles. Violins and a synthesiser/accordion are used on some tracks along with the traditional drums, flute, and strings. Two of the baladi tracks - one traditional and one by Said - use a mizmar(Egyptian folk oboe). Good dance pieces, including an instrumental version of Lissa Fakir, and 2 drum solos played by Khamis Henkesh. Keyboard is featured in many tracks, 3 of the pieces composed by Said explore the use of sounds made possible by synthesiser, this may be less attractive to those who like acoustic arabic music."
4,Kinesio Tex tape,The exact tape the hand therapy clinic uses on my wrist/hand.Works miracles. A little pricey! Check to make sure you order thecorrect width for your application. Not too easy to cut to half size.
4,German quality,"good starter set. really sharp. My wife and I use them a lot. No steak knives though, have to buy those separately but right now too expensive."
4,self-destruction or self-redemption?,"Vera Farmiga won a Sundance award for her portrayal of Irene, a blue collar checkout clerk, mom of two boys, and compulsive cokehead. Irene is a survivor of sorts who is easy to admire. She clearly loves her boys Ben and Jason, finds another job cleaning houses when the grocery store fires her (""I was fast because I was high, but when I came clean I slowed down.""), and even checks herself into rehab. But she leaves rehab early, spends her kid's birthday check on crack, and leaves her dead beat husband for a recovering addict named Bob. Their emerging love devolves into relapse, co-dependence, and new spasms of self-destructive choices. Writer-director Debra Granik also won a Sundance Director's Award for this film. Befitting the despair and depth of Irene's problems, the entire film takes place in the dead of winter, and at the film's end the plot remains open and unresolved. Rated R for drug use and some nudity."
5,Vera is great in a well made movie.,"It seems to me that addiction, in the media, is usually portrayed unrealistically in one way or another. Either addicts are vilified, or portrayed as helpless victims, or are perhaps portrayed in some other extreme way. This movie provides what appears to be a very realistic version of what addiction is like on a day to day basis for real people. Vera Farmiga is the center of the movie, and the story, while there are other important characters, revolves around her character's journey away from drugs. Nothing is sensationalized. Nothing is blown out of proportion. If you are looking for excitement and thrills, this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for something down-to-earth, engrossing and, really, educational - done in a manner that makes you actually CARE about the characters, this may be what you're looking for."
3,Worth the money,"Good deal for the money. Labels that go on bins are cheap, but work. I would definetely recommend for the money."
4,work horse,"This drill is light weight, yet very powerful. When you have to hold a drill all day, you want to make sure it's as light as possible and the battery lasts. The fact that it recharges in 30 minutes is another great feature. Highly recommended."
4,Great small job drill,"I got this as my indoor drill, for jobs typically in smaller places or working in tight spaces. The drill is nice and light and very well balanced. The battery doesn't last ultra long, but I have to remind myself its just a 12V battery, not my 19.2V."
5,Nice Little Drill,"This drill is a champ, I had an old stick type 9.6v Makita that served me well for 8 years. When I finally lost the last battery I decided to buy a new drill. I never really wanted more power than the 9.6v Makita delivered so I didn't see the point in getting a huge cordless drill. This drill is light, incredibly comfortable, all the power I need in a cordless and for $80 with a flashlight and a rebate for a third battery it was a no brainer."
1,you get what you paid for,I bought this set for my wife since she wanted some tools in case she ever wanted to do something around the house. The flashlight went out on the first day when we received it. It's not the bulb. the light just stopped working. The drill is weak and I don't see it lasting much longer either. If you want decent tools I guess you have to pay for them.
4,A Triumph of the Human Spirit,"This novel is not only about the conquest to defeat Mt. Everest, it is about the strength of the human spirit.While attempting to top Mt. Everest 10 climbers come to grips with their weaknesses and strengths. They come to understand about morality and the things that are truly important in this life.This novel was a good read on several levels."
2,You get what you pay for,"With this you are getting a controller (with turbo feature) a 4mb (small variety) memory card, and a controller extension cord. I found the controller worked fine for some games but other games were more sensitive and the controller did not callibrate properly. I ended up trading the controller in for a couple bucks. The memory card is too small to be useful.. nintendo even stopped making them of this size. The extension cord is the only thing I ever use from this pack now and better ones can be had cheaply. Don't waste your money. Stick with the genuine nintendo controllers and memory cards it's not worth the minimal cost savings buying this as it's not high quality anything."
5,A great book for people who want to learn about 737-300-800,"I personally love airplanes and I bought this book because it is simply the best book specifically on the Boeing 737. It has tons of details that an aviation enthusiast like me, would want to see. I like the whole series of books called Airliner color history. I am planning on getting a copy of 737-100 & 737-200 as well. The detailed writing and great information as well as very good beautiful color photos makes this book great. Underneath every photo, there is a caption with great information. I also like the production list at the end of the book so that you can look up any 737-300-737-800 and find out when it went into service and other interesting info. I recommend it to anyone who likes airplanes and especially someone who really knows a lot about them and/or wants to learn a lot about them."
5,Yes it is that good,"I came across some fairly brutal reviews for this album. Ah well, every man to his own. This work is impossibly subtle, daydream for a second and you miss a mindblowing transisition. If you think I'm joking try finding the twenty-something transistions my midi program detected on track 2. The theme is middle easternish which is the perfect atmosphere for Gerrard's impossible voice. What I like most about this album, and the reason I am writing this review is becasue of the way each track ends. No seriously, even if you don't like the track in question, you have to admit.... I mean I haven't seen such stunning fade offs since Tony Gonzalez's ""Unrecorded""Highly recommended for electronica, ambience lovers and aphex twin fanatics."
2,Mid-eastern melancholy just did not intice me,Read all the 5 star reviews and expected a 5 star album. Production of album was good but I have not found many mid-east music albums that I've kept. I listened many times but the songs never grew into anything I looked forward to hearing again.
2,Not Karen's Best,"Karen is a no-nonsense instructor who is very good about teaching proper form. I find this video very uninspiring, though. A dark, rather dreary set with background exercisers who strike poses and seem to have vowed not to show any pleasure or enthusiasm in the workout. I enjoy the thorough warm-up and often just used it on its own to warm-up for other activities. But from there the video goes downhill. The aerobics are speeded-up low impact and I found them to be jarring and poorly transitioned. The toning section is better but after doing the Firm and others, it was quite a bore to me. I have since gotten rid of this video. My advice is to check out other videos by Karen, not this one."
2,Misogynistic and Shallow,"I found the heroine (ZD) so flatly written that she could only come off as a selfish, flightly idiot. She never has a chance to be a real person nor to have any real character. To anyone reading today, with any smattering of enlightenment, I believe Zulieka Dobson will be frustrating and annoying. She's set up to make a mean-spirited point. I suggest picking up Evelyn Waugh or Nancy Mitford to get some fine writing on the society of the between-war period and the English upper classes."
5,Uproariously funny,"Zuleika and the Duke are two towering caricatures who will keep you chortling. Bring a dictionary along for the ride (preferably the OED, in which you might find some words you look up cited for Beerbohm's usage), but you can still let the magical prose flow."
1,a book never understood,"i dont understand this book.. but its about an emperor's death which then jindigar the dashau and his human friend krinata knew they must find their crew to hide before the allegiancy Squadron pursues them.. Stranded in a land aswarm with creatures that saw them as enemy or prey , only the power of a Dushau/human mind cud show them the path of safety.. But the last time Krinata and Jindigars Dushau team had linked minds.. they had generated only death and madness.. i dont know who survived da dare risk linking agen;.."
5,a gift,They loved it. good deal for the price. I don't know what else to write about this. It's okay is all I have to say.
4,I'm a student of IIR,"I decided to learn Reflexology from the pioneers of Reflexology ... the IIR (International Institute of Reflexology). This is one of the required books for the home study portion of their courses.It's boring as far as reading each and every page, but VERY informative with a rich amount of information. I usually just read the first and last sentences of the paragraph. Skim and scan - that's it for me. However it still sits on my bookshelf so I can reference it at a moment's notice."
5,Awesome book.,This book is great. I am working toward my reflexology certification and my instructor calls this book The Foot Bible.
4,Good coverage of e-Government scene in Asia,Comprehensive coverage of the e-Government scene in Asia. A useful guide for someone looking for a snapshot of the e-Government development in most major countries in Asia. A study into the Japanese market or perhaps Australiasia will make it more complete. Highly recommended!
2,Lots of Articles - Little on Firearm values,"Lots of articles on topics related to shooting from A to Z. I was looking for a back up for Gun Traders and Gun Digest for research and value information. I was disappointed with the Shooter's Bible in this respect... however, should you need information on ballistics, reloading, some history and many other items, it might be for you!"
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get such a great deal on this combo set. Now I see why it was such a deal. The scrubber does NOT have the removable ""versa pack"" battery that allows you to charge one battery while using one. When the battery in this one is dead, so is the scrubber. Ugh"
4,"A little extra protection, Billy","My camera often rides shotgun with a set of keys, credit cards, and any number of other things in my pocket that would scratch the screen given half a chance. This is a simple, inexpensive solution. Very easy to install with excellent results, and provides a nice extra layer of protection. It won't hold back the ocean, but then I'm not asking it to. Recommended."
2,The content was what I expected but I thought that it was either new or like new.,I thought that the book was either new or like new.A previous owner wrote comments on the pages. The spine had damage to it before I received it.I like the content however.
1,Printed Anesthetic,"Absolutely no laymen, and few lawyers (only those nerdy, dweeby law professor types) could or would read this book. I was required to read it thirty years ago in law school. I was surprised to see it still in print. Granted, a lawyer should know what the ancient English forms of action were, but not in this detail (even with charts!). Only thing I can imagine worse or more boring would be to have sat through Professor Maitland's lectures, from which this book was derived. On the other hand, we have too many lawyers as it is. Maybe all would-be law students should read this before they applyy--could cut down on applications!"
5,Pleased with Purchase,"A little of this product goes a long way. There is virtually no smell and it absorbs into the skin giving a matte finish. I am very pleased with this product.We all pay the price, sooner or later, if we don't protect our skin from the sun."
3,fun stuff,"These are movies from my youth, fun to watch on rainy afternoons and you want to get lost in simple style movies."
5,One of the best glam records.,"This one is an old favorite and somewhat little known gem. These guys are actually back together and their new album, As It Is on Earth, is out soon. Most people are familiar with the first album and its huge hit but this album is leagues better. This is glamy pop rock done right. Damn near every song is a great addition to the record. Melodies and singing and lyrics are all far above the normal. Mungo City, Almonds Kisses w/Stipe, 2nd Avenue, Skylark, which will have you seeing Beatle vision, and Lucy's Shoe are among the best songs and really damn fine songs in their own right. I would urge people to at least check this underrated album out. It's a throwback to Bowie and T. Rex of old but done in a less crazy and more commercial light akin to some of Bowie's later records. I think it stands the test of time."
4,Awesome,"This disc is fun and creative. A genuine attempt to explore other aspects of rock. A fun trip from beginning to end. I picked this disc up on a whim when it first came out, and though I was surprised at first becuase I didn't know what to expect, it grew on me. A quick pointer: try and listen to a disc more than once. We all just need to be put in the groove. Music has a magic, just different types :)"
5,Yeah...I like it.,"This is a great album for the car...it's the kind of album you get obsessed with...really cool stuff on ""Carry On"" and ""Goodbye Violet Race"". I had to break the record in before I could really get into it...it seems like that type of album.Moped Williams"
5,"This is good, fun music.","To much of nineties rock is whiney or depressed or whatever. The Chinese Album shows what fun music can be. From the wacky lyrics, great hooks and plain absudity, Spacehog represents a worthy successor to all that was good and fun in the British Invasion."
4,good value,"they're inexpensively made, but are of pretty good quality. At about $2.50 per harmonica it's a really good deal if you're curious about a multi key set."
2,Very Dated Boys Entertainment,"I bought this for the superb title only, So, aside of the name, what merit does it have? Little for a 32 year old man who does not revel in military prowess, and I feel unable to don my 12 year old boy's cap and enjoy in Rifleman Dodd's extraordinary capers. One man against the entire French army may seem like steep odds, but with the authors considerable existence, there was no sense he was even in danger. This is the book's biggest flaw, along with the dubious morality of such celebration of warfare. Otherwise harmless; not challenging reading but nor is it particularly rewarding."
1,Please save your time,"This ""book"" takes the least possible information that you could source and still call it a book. In fact, the publisher has done the history of income tax a disservice by foisting this material on us. Neil Boortz with his Flat Tax and Steve Forbes with his Fair Tax, for their diatribes, depend on the public staying uninformed about the matters that determine public policy. Mr. Federer has not enlightened us at all. He has taken two or three statements made by John Kennedy and tried to stretch it into a book. Save yourself the time and read any financial history by Steele or Bernstein or the Wiley Investment Series and you'll learn more about income tax and other historical matters of interest. This is about the only book I ever returned to Amazon."
5,What can you say,Jane Ann KJrentz did it again. Love the fantasy and the story line kept me through til the end. I read every thing of hers I can and if you are a fan you will remain one!
3,Convoluted story..........,"Not having read Stanford for awhile, I recalled more character development and fewer twists and turns. The story line was interesting but a bit hard to follow."
3,Not the best Naxos CD,"Mostly, the German Wind Soloists play well, reserved, perhaps. But in the Adagio, the trill from the clarinet is all off. I don't know if it is a difficult trill to play. The rest is OK, not really jaunty enough for this type of Mozart, a bit heavy handed.I like the sound though, quite close miked, a little muddy in the lower register instruments."
5,The Best Album,"Around the Campfire is one of the best albums we've purchased in years. We have three preschoolers in our house, and sometimes the only way to get a little quiet is to put this album in the CD player. It seems to sooth the savage beasts. The harmony of Peter, Paul & Mary is as good as ever. Mary's voice has changed over the years, but she has the voice of a woman who has experienced life and raised children. I hope this album brings back as many old memories and makes new ones for you and your family."
3,Good book but need to revise for a newer version,"I just purchased the book. And I think this book is well organized. But, this book is based on version 17(I guess) now we are using 20-> 2000 and the environment is a lot different. The author have to revise this book....Really."
2,Fireplaces (What's in Style),"Not a complete work. Covers almost no construction details, and the styles shown are in no way a complete work up of mantels."
1,There was a mummy in this mummy movie??????,"I am probably one of the world's foremost biggest fans of the Mummy genre. I have damn near every one available on VHS and even a few recorded off of that old show Saturday Night Dead. But this film was the biggest waste of money, time and energy I have ever encountered. I guess they thought that if they marketed it as 'Bram Stoker's Mummy' that it might have the same shelf appeal as the Dracula re-release. It doesn't. It is trash. The actors are trash. The script is trash. The special effects would have been trash too if the production crew had decided to pool a few bucks together to give the film any. Read what others have to say and take it to heart. Rent Howling V instead, you'll be much happier, you know what I'm saying?"
1,Terrible!,"First, I would like to say to who ever said that Bram Stoker did not write The Mummy is wrong! Bram Stoker did write the Mummy, I finished reading it in January of 1997! And this, although faithful to the book, is lame, and violent, with bad acting. Whoever made this was trying to copy the brilliance of Bram Stoker's Dracula (which is indeed ""brilliant""), but did a poor job. If they wanted a good movie, the director should have been Francis-Ford Coppola, the director of Bram Stoker's Dracula."
4,Worked GREAT,"My husband purchased this DustBuster for quick clean-ups in the van. How is it that mini-vans can get so messy so quickly? It worked beautifully from the carpet to our son's booster seat.In fact, our son LOVED to use it when there were crumbs on the floor from eating snacks in the living room (sometimes I think that he dropped crumbs just so he could use it!).The suction on this DustBuster was impressive. I have had several before this one and their suction level was far less than that of this Dust Buster.The battery life is also worth mentioning. The battery remained strong for the cleaning of the mini-van. The DustBuster's charging unit can be mounted on the wall or placed on a flat surface.This DustBuster really does deserve a 5-star rating but ours stopped working after about 4 months. I think that we just got a defective unit. Those things happen sometimes and I'll follow-up with Black & Decker soon."
4,Works well for me,"I bought this several months ago, for small jobs around the house or vacuuming out the car and have been very pleased with it. Seems to be a lot stronger suction than other models I used in the past. I don't really use it enough to comment on how long it goes between charges, but I can say out of all the ones I researched this was the most affordable and seems to be of high quality."
3,Good at first....,"I purchased this in August 2005. I have been impressed for the last couple of years. It is powerful and worked for our purposes (mostly quick touch ups around the kitchen/dining room floor.) Used it on quick cat hair dust bunnies for a year or so too. It has a wall mount and the tool attaches to the bottom, so storage was terrifically convenient. However, the battery won't hold a charge anymore. It starts out powerful when we turn it on, and in 3 seconds kicks down, little by little, until it is barely sucking in about 2 minutes. It worked great while I used it, but I wish the battery pack would have lasted longer (maybe I'm asking too much?) and I wish I would have been able to replace the battery to keep using it (can't find a replacement anywhere) so now the whole thing will fill a wastesite since I have to buy completely new. That lowered it a star."
5,The Best DustBuster,"This DustBuster has great power, it really works. I have tried 2 other models and this is the best one yet. Highly recommended."
5,"Powerful, convenient, looks good!","This is much better than the other hand helds I have owned. Do a good job with powerful suctuion, especially in the bathroom for picking up loose hair. Looks good, does not take up much space. Very happy with product."
1,Motor Problems on a Black and Decker Cyclonic DustBuster,"Purchased a Black and Decker Cyclonic DustBuster, worked for a few weeks then it would not run except when held upside down. Looked like the brushes on the electric motor were messed up. Threw it in the trash. With all the good reviews written about this item, it appears to be one of the best small vacs, I might just try another unless I can find a better quality one. The wife likes hand vacs."
1,START PRAYING AS SOON AS YOU BUY THIS DUSTBUSTER,"Pray that all the parts are in the package.First I e'd in asking for the missing parts and they didn't reply.Days later I called in. The operator didn't have the part number, so fora good deal of time I waited while she polled members of mis-management;no joy. End result, I was on my own, as you could well be.And for awhile, the phone person maintained that the missing part was Amazon's fault - their sealed package came within an Amazon box: No wayit was Amazon's fault.Nice looking unit though, although heavy and 'way complex to work with.Unfortunately, I'd tossed the packaging and the returnwould've been sucha hassle I'll make do.Famous name, infamous customer serviceand quality control.Caveat Emptor, folks."
2,Author very important but not a good book for learning.,"John Wolff is a very important figure in recording the Bisaya language. He was instrumental in creating perhaps the best Bisaya (Cebuano) dictionary to date. ""Beginning Cebuano"" was a product of his extensive work throughout the 1960s and early 70s. It is a very extensive text suitable for classroom instruction; however, it is very lengthy, uses odd notations and spellings that can mis-inform new students who do not have benefit of an instructor, and the book is both hard to find and very expensive to purchase. There are more effective learning texts available, particularly for self-study, so this book is better suited to the scholar, qualified instructor and collector."
2,More like a huge advert for proprietary software,"I applaud the goal as stated in the book's title, and we very much need such a book. For me, this isn't it. I felt that their synopsis claims were not entirely honest: not only is this book based entirely on a proprietary operating system, but the learning version included with the book has been hamstrung to protect the full version. This makes sense, but their chosen method was to prevent you from being able to save your programming to disk or ROM; in other words, so that it can't be embedded. Seems difficult at best to learn embedded programming with software that can't be embedded. And the retail version of the tools on which this book is based cost a fortune. I suppose you could filter for more generally applicable information, but for me it just wasn't worth it. If you were going to pony up the dough for their OS, it would definitely be useful, but in that case they should give it to you as a manual!"
4,Greatness,My Aunt gets 'Bento Beat Box' which plays Jpop/rock etc music vids. I loved this song and the video. Quite pleasing to hear even if you don't speak the language.
3,Preschool Book,"Splash! is a cute ""learn to count to 10"" book, very nicely illustrated with photos of penguins in Antarctica. Everyone loves penguins, so learning to count with them is pure fun! Recommended for preschool children."
4,An All Star Cast!,"The production quality isn't the greatest...but an early great mix of talent. I was suprised to see C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and John and Joan Cuzack in a movie together."
2,"Wanted to like it, but . . . (SPOILER)","The 80s were hard enough to live through. Watching friends die of AIDS was hard, and shaped the lives of all of us who lived through the early days of the epidemic. I personally remember the mental struggles of the fear before we were even able to test for the disease. But to throw a suicide into that mix was just too much for me. I wanted to like the movie, but in the end felt frustrated and that I had wasted time watching the movie. More than that, it disturbed me later and I definitely needed something lighter before ending the day."
5,Has it all,"This CD has it all, from Jimi Hendrix's Red House to SArah McLachlan's Angel and everything in between. It's made up of a variety of different music styles which make the CD truck along at an exciting pace. The tunes tie into the movie perfectly, especially the cuts by Alanis Morrisstte, Paula COle and the Goo-Goo Dolls. From old '70s rock to the newest artists around, this Cd is definately one to add to your collection!"
4,Very well done...,"I got this cd after seeing the movie, for the song ""Iris"" By now, it is not one of my favorites. Contray to most reviews, I do like Jude's song on this. Also, Gaberial Yared is amazing! He can take one theme and vary it so much. This cd is worth buying just for those five tracks."
5,I absoulouty love it!!,"If you ask me Sarah McLachian is one the most moving artists that I have herd in a long time, probably in 10 years. I would do any thing to meet her and to see where she gets such insperation to produce such wonderfully, immensly moving work! God Bless her!"
2,Not that good,"The only reason I got this CD was because I needed another CD in a buy one, get one free deal and I liked Iris by the GGDolls. It's the only really good song on it. Most of the other stuff I just skip over because its so bad."
2,"""Iris"" is ok, but the rest of the CD is very boring !",I think this CD is very boring and I wouldnt recommend it. But if you like CD's that just contain one good music you should buy this but I certainly wouldnt recommend.
3,"Some Good, Some Average, Some Bad","Let's start off with the Average. While Gabriel Yared's score for The English Patient was dramatic and brilliant, his score for City of Angels is less interesting. Also on the list is ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls. The Bad: Jimi Hendrix (Great guitarist, but not a great work), John Lee Hooker (Haven't heard much of his music, not that great), Jude (Boring and pointless), Eric Clapton (A great guitarist. This song is upbeat, yet slow). The Good: Peter Gabriel is back in prime form with ""I Grieve"" (Smooth and stylistic). Sarah McLachlan (Not my favorite artist, but I could stand to listen to this one). Paula Cole (Her songs get old after awhile and this may, too, but for now it's fresh). U2 starts the album off with a stylistic peice that almost bookends with Gabriel's. The best on the album, however, is ""Uninvited"" by Alanis Morissette. If the song is heard well enough in the film, look for a possible Oscar nomination in March."
5,Makes you think about life!,"This music reflects the contents of the movie as nothing else can! The best album to go with a movie up to now. If you actually listen to the lirics (Goo Goo dolls and Peter Gabriel and even Sarah McLachlan) you start to grasp the idea that you just can't take life for granted! And about shooting Alanis and others, ? Buy this and take it with you on long drives! Start thinking!"
3,So peaceful...so tender,"I like the ""Angel"" by Sarah the most. Secondly is the ""Iris"" by Goo Goo Dolls. The ""Angel"" song is very great, it brings along with passions, something that deep inside your mind,it remind me a lot.This song makes me miss a person that already passed away a few years ago. I don't know whether it good or not...."
2,Mixed feelings,Two traps only caught one mole. I had better luck drowning with drowning the little buggers out with the garden hose. My neighbors cat also offered some assistance.
2,Hasn't worked for us yet.,"We've had the trap set (in various locations) for a month or so now and haven't caught one mole. I'm impressed by those who have caught moles but it's not that easy. We've tried the stick that makes a pulsating noise, moth balls, grub killer and the trap with no success. I've asked friends and the only success they have had is with rat poison."
3,Not for Florida yard moles,"This items looks to be quality and the operation seems to work, but the moles in my Florida yard are much smaller than the moles this items is designed to trap."
3,"ok, but several typos","The content is pretty good, but expect several typos, especially in the practice problems."
5,Excellent Book,An excellent book. Fom the time I ordered it to the time I received it was just a few days.The book was in excellent condition and I highly recommend it.Using Amazon in the past has always been a great experience. They stand by their word.
3,A new view of the DCU,"Never before has there been a more perfect blend of story and art. Darwyn Cooke is able to take all, I mean all, the charaters of the DC Universe and put them in the '40s and '50s and make them fit extremely well. Sadly, the layout of the book and certain scenes were plodding along and slowed down the book a lot. There were too many cut aways that don't seem to fit with the overall story. I'm sure, knowing the work of Cooke they will in the last volume but as of right now they seem very seperate. Also, the book has so many characters and many of the males, not being in costume, look alike. Overall, a decent read that will probably be better read together with volume two."
2,Less is less,This is less than Shakespearian. The book never makes me wonder if Caesar will live or wonder why he should not
5,Simply awesome.,Brad Mehldau is one of the biggest talents in jazz today. This cd clealy marks his journey into new territory.
4,Irene WOEFULLY miscast!!,"This is a beautifully designed production! However the casting of Gina McKee is dreadfully wrong.It would have been like casting the young Katharine Hepburn as Irene. Just wrong. Mckee is a very intelligent thoughtful actress but projects all the wrong qualities for Irene. Even so, Galsworthy's material is so brilliant and this production so strong, that The Forsyte Saga is STILL worth owning or renting. I'm currently watching the late 60's version-truly superb--and , actually looking forward to the second installment of the newer version, despite Ms. McKee"
1,Certain Tragedy.,"Let me take this awkward saw, run it against my ears, cut some flesh away, so I can't hear this crap anymore."
1,Hard Critic,"One question. Is this really STD? I have all the previous recordings and I am sad to say that ""In Reverie"" will not be part of my STD collection. For a minute I thought I was listening to Weezer."
3,the right direction with excessive vocal vibratto,"Yeah this cd is definitely not as bad as some of you haters say (the worst cd ever? c'mon!), but the vocals do get a little corny and weak at times (excessive vibratto, like he's singing lounge or something). I appreciate their movement away from powerpop, powerchord ballads and I don't blame them for moving away from pop-punk after the Blink 182 fiasco. This album has some great songs and their sound has remained original. Alkaline Trio does suck."
5,new sound; same great music,"ok, so a lot of people are saying that SAVES THE DAY have taken a whole new sound, and they're right. IN REVERIE is a much lighter sound than previous albums, but it works extremely well. catchy hooks, emotional vocals, and perfect lyrics. if you like STAY WHAT YOU ARE, you'll like IN REVERIE. and who can't like great music?stand out tracks:anywhere with youdriving in the darkin reveriewaking life"
3,A Letdown.,"Saves the Day, in my opinion, reached their peak with Stay What You Are, and now this follow-up shows that. Most of the songs on it are pretty good, but they aren't the same as what you'd normally expect of a Saves the Day record. Which would't necessarily be a bad thing, but in this case it's not a particularly impressive difference. Then again, the melody, catchiness, and general goodness of the songs is undeniable. My biggest problem with it is that it's lost the edge it had, even with Stay What You Are. I miss the speed, intensity and fun of pop-punkish songs, like ""Firefly"", which was hard and fast. But on this album, you have, say, ""Tomorrow Too Late"". Decent song, great musical qualities, but isn't the Saves the Day I know and love. I'd say the best songs on here, the ones that redeem it, are ""Monkey"", ""Anywhere With You"", ""What Went Wrong"", and ""Morning in the Moonlight""."
1,A BIG Disappointment,"Is this a joke, why does Chris now sound like Big Bird. I love Saves the Day, and I heard that this CD was so aweful but I could not believe it, then I heard it and I actually laughed...this CD is a joke right, I am hoping STD will release a real album and tell us all April Fool even though it is not April. I am still a fan, but damm after hearing this stupid CD it is kind of hard to tell people that, if you are a true fan of the STD style, you will hate this CD, don't listen to these other idiots that rave about this CD, it is probably the first time they heard of STD, trust me!"
2,a major disappointment,"I am really disappointed in this album. I have always been a huge fan of saves the day and i love their first 3 albums, but i didn't even find myself able to listen to this whole album. Hell, i didn't even buy it, my friend (another huge Saves the Day fan) gave it to me because he didn't want it sitting next to his other Saves the Day albums. Maybe if i listen to it a little bit more it will grow on me, who knows, its happened in the past. For now however, i am going to have to say that this cd is really awful. DO NOT BUY IT SOLELY BASED ON LIKING PREVIOUS SAVES THE DAY ALBUMS!!!"
4,very good album throughout,"i'll preface this by saying that i can see why fans of older saves the day material might not like in reverie. it lacks the immediate emotion of their previous efforts (mostly due to the more mellow vocals throughout). however, the music and melody itself is much matured from stay what you are, and that's a good thing. any time that a band decides to do something like this, it's met with mixed reviews. if you can put aside any pre-conceived notions as to what you think saves the day should sound like, it's a great album. every track is good...and yes, it's better than stay what you are, through being cool, or can't slow down."
1,what the hell happened?!,"I absolutely LOVE saves the day. all of their previous albums were pure genious ('can't slow down', 'i'm sorry i'm leaving', 'stay what you are', and 'through being cool'), and they were something anyone could easily relate to. well, this new album disappointed me so much. he changed his voice, which is ok, but if he sang the same way as before it would be much more enjoyable to listen to. so i popped the cd in, first track was pretty cool. the second track, i swore i had hit repeat or something. all the other tracks on this album are the same!! they all sound way too similar to each other and the whole album is incredible boring. if you know saves the day and have been a huge fan of all their old stuff, stick with the old stuff. i'm sure some people will like this, but if you like who saves the day was, this is NOT an album for you most likely."
3,Disappointing,"I hate to say it but this CD is certainly not high quality. Of course, maybe I am expecting too much since there is no possible way they could ever top their previous one, Stay What You Are. I don't know why but this CD just doesn't seem to be Saves the Day material. I would much more suggest Stay What You Are to all customers thinking about buying this CD. If you are a die-hard Saves the Day fan then maybe this is good for you, but I was only able to find one song I liked... ""Anywhere With You"". I give this three stars only because Saves the Day is one of my favorite bands and I went to a concert of theirs and it was awesome. But Stay What You Are is my suggestion to Saves the Day and to all customers. This CD lacks the musical intensity that ""Stay What You Are"" had."
1,Deserves to get no stars,"The only other CD I have of Saves the Day is Through Being Cool. I bought this CD thinking that it would be along the lines of Through Being Cool and boy was I wrong!!! First of all its sounds like a whole different group of guys. The singer sounds totally different and trust me, change isn't always good. The singers vioce is high and whiny kinda sounds like weezer but higher. Almost like a girl. The music is mellow so don't expect any fast beat uptempo punk rock tracks like in Through Being Cool. I listen to the CD once and tossed it into the abyss that is my CD holder. Never again will I waste my time on it. Download a couple of tracks before you buy to see what I mean. I'd rather put 14 bucks in the gas tank than to buy this cd. Junk."
1,I would actually give this album ZERO STARS!!!,"THIS ALBUM IS THE BIGGEST PEICE OF CRAP I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE.THEY SOLD OUT, THATS ALL I CAN SAY. DOES THE LEAD SINGER EVEN SOUND THE SAME ANY MORE? NO!! BECAUSE THEY ARE BUNCH OF PUSSIES THAT SOLD OUT. I did have respect for their older albums when they sounded original and good. BUT THIS ALBUM IS CRAP!!!!!DEATH TO ALL WHO DISAGREE(capital letters mean I am yelling!!!)PS THIS IS ALBUM SUCKS!"
3,"Saves the Day, 4th album, what a disappointment.","My favorite band since 1998 had been the beautiful, the wonderful, the deep, sincere, Saves the Day. Chris' under developed voice, the thrashing instruments and the vengeful lyrics got me everytime. Then, they come out with this wanker cd. What a way to ruin a freakin' great career! I was so sad, I almost cried when i listened to the cd. What happened to anger? The heartache? The sadness? What in the hell is wrong with this picture?!"
1,what...what...what!?,"In Saves the Day fourth album they blast through their old sound and find something that we all knew they had inside of them. Really bad music. Not like bad like Michael Jackson, but bad like running over a cat. The vocals are a high pitched attempt at singing in a soft beautiful manner. Basically the vocals [are bad]. Well I have good news, if you can't stand the vocals you still have the music to lsiten to. Oh wait, nevermind that [is bad] too. Here's a recap, Saves the Day used to rock the party that rocked the body but now they just [are bad]."
2,ehhh,"Honestly, I had better expectations for this album. It's nice how it's somewhat of a change from its previous albums, but it's not much of a change for the better. I really don't like the change in voice either. It almost sounds like he doesn't know how to sing. I'm hoping the CD will grow on me, but as of now, it's not at the top of my ""CDs I love to listen to"" list. Another thing that bugged me is that there are 12 tracks at a total of only 33 minutes. There could've been more play time, in my opinion. It's not too bad, but I'd recommend all of their older albums over this one."
5,Catholic? Want to understand God? READ THESE BOOKS,"Great books for Catholics and Christians alike. Catholics find great comfort in the Lord's Prayer. The Great House of God likens each part of the prayer to a room in a house -- and brings God alive for those who may not understand how he truly works. Just like Jesus explains the heart of God's Son (aka ""The Word"" before he came to earth as a human). And when Christ comes gives us hope for eternity. Doesn't get much better than this Trifecta."
5,Essential for any writer's bookshelf,"Whether you're just getting started or a veteran writer, you'll turn to this invaluable resource time and again."
4,Complete US Rules of Chess,"You will find a very good index and table of contents making everything you are looking for easy to find. This book is a must for very serious tournament player, chess coach and required for tournament directors who run tournaments under the United States Chess Federation.I agree that the book is so huge it is hard to pinpoint what rules are more important than others to focus on for a chess player. Most scholastic tournamnets use a ""sudden death"" time control but with digital clocks having time delay it is complicated to understand for a beginner to chess tournaments. There are a couple of books that do explain ""chess tournaments"" in a more simplified way already published. But no book can replace owning a copy of the ""United States Chess Federation's Official Rules"". My suggestion is for them to do a future edition with a chapter for the beginner to point out which sections are most important, especially for the scholastic player."
3,"It's a necessary product, so why not get it here?","The book is a necessity for every tournament director or club president. If you play in a tournament, it wouldn't hurt to have it either. Those are the reasons to buy it. So the real consideration is where to buy it.There are the usual choices, the most obvious being the US Chess Federation. Amazon's better, cheaper, and the product's easier to find here than anywhere else."
3,I'm glad I have it.,"It is, after all, just a rule book. It is something that atournament player needs to refer to, but it isnot a thunderbolt."
5,Lots of nuts.,The apricot n' nut bars are really good. We love that the bars have a generous amount of nuts in them and that the apricots aren't too dry. We've purchased apricot bars in other brands and have found them hard over-dried hard to chew pieces versus the apricots in these bars which are moist and chewy.The only warning I have is to hide them if you're just intending them for lunch bags. They seem to disappear!
5,cooking mama,Nice to have these organic granola bars. My kids love them and they are a healthy snack. I give them at their lunch for an extra cookie treat.
4,Review From Mr. Ronto's CCG and RPG Page,"This book is a good mystery, in a nutshell. It's got a good and slightly complex story line, with many surprises along the way. Even though some surprises were expected, others were a big surprise. This story is not a comic FR novel, as some are, but more serious, and terror and surprise are the big attractions here. It's kinda like Sherlock Holmes or something, but the main part is played by a pretty nasty character. Unlike other FR novels, the main character of this one are aging and not in so good shape, which is nice to see one in a while, to know that not all people in the Forgotten Realms are hulking barbarians or mystical mages, it adds realism to an already perfect world. Entertaining as it is exciting and well written, you should definitely ""pinch"" this one up next time you want to read a good FR novel."
3,King Pinch,I am about 3/4 of the way through this book. It is very slow going and I can't wait until it is over. Not as good as I thought it would be.
1,Nano Cover,"Well to start off, the positive about this product, the material its made out of is really durable, and i like it, it really does protect your nano, they were easy to put on and the screen protecters are great, but the negative,and why i gave this product one star,but if i had to give it no stars for being such [...] than i would, it doenst fit the nano right, it doesnt cover a great portion of the bottom of the nano, you really have to fight to get to the hold button, part of the cover hangs over on the screen so its hard to see what your looking at and since its too small for the nano the cover also hangs over on your selector which causes it to push the buttons on it, so u could be listening to a song and then it shuts off because the cover is pushing the button! honestly i will be returning this item, it is durable to make it thu a year in in iraq, but the bottom half of my nano will be ruined! dont waste your money on this product"
3,It's a little different,"Well it is not the classical Agatha scheme and it doesn't have a ""central"" character as Poirot or Ms Mapple but nevertheless is interesting, the end is unexpected as usual."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","If you buy this on an impulse because of the price, it can do no harm. But it also won't convince you of Berlioz's greatness if it is your first encounter with him. The sound isn't great, but nothing too bad. My ultimate complaint is that is a tad too short. Steinberg drives the performance a little too fast, and there is very little fantasy that is part of Berlioz's trademark. A little pale in interpretation. Definitely don't buy it if you want to hear Berlioz for the first time, but as I say, the price probably won't hurt."
4,It's alright....,"A story of a boy who tries to live in the shadow of his dead father. The main character lives with his mother as he tries to figure out who he is. His best friend is a whiz at math and helps him to learn and understand the angles of pool. An old friend of the boy's deceased father comes back into the picutre, much to the dismay of the main character's mother. Toward the end of the book the boy enters a local pool tournament and has to go up against some stiff competition. The book's end is so predictable that its like walking outside to see clouds in the sky. Still a fairly good read with a handful of boring sections. Get through the boring parts for a good book."
2,"Great for dancing, but not for listening","This album is almost a musical recapitulation of the stereotype of Latin machismo. You can love the boy's body, but when you wake up in the morning, thinking of what he said, you shudder."
3,"It's an OK disc,but not as good as A TYPICAL AUTOCTONAL BAND","This disc has some good tracks, however, it does not compare with their first CD, A TYPICAL AUTOCTONAL VENEZUELAN BAND. That CD has to be in your collection. It relates more with the dance and ska scene, you could find it at the official website of the band, you won't find it anywhere else, not even here."
5,Very comfortable,"Wanted a pair of slides, took a chance on buying these shoes in my average size. Very pleased with the softness of the leather and love both the color and fit. Only wish was I would have got a pair in white. Now I'm looking at all the Duck brand shoes."
3,"well made, but very narrow","had to return these, which was a disappointment, as the Duck Head brand is a well made show. However, even ordering an extra wide shoe a half size larger than usual, they were so narrow that I had to return them."
3,I liked the concept of this book,"The concept of this book is good. You can't change other people, and you can't always avoid them. The most realistic option is to have some coping strategies. I think the author outlined them well. I gave the book three stars, though, because the reading got to be tedious and boring. I've read similar books that are more enjoyable, either because you can identify the different personality type with humor, or because they explained the personalities more realistically with better situational examples. This book seemed a little dry."
1,"""Waste of Time""",Unfortunately I found this book simply ridiculous. It mirrors the standard self help genre books which make up their own terminology and further cite examples of supposedly real individuals personal experiences which are not believable.
4,Another very good cabot book.,"I didn't think I was going to like this book at first. I really didn't like some of the characters, namely ross and georgiana. But after i got use to the bickering etc. in the beginning, and once Payton and Drake were on the ship, I loved it. I have not been disapointed yet with Ms. Cabot. She is on my must buy list."
4,Fun story,"Payton Dixon has loved Connor Drake for many years but when he is about to marry another woman and her father has given him her ship as a wedding present, she must take action. Unleashing a scandal in her own way, Payton stops the wedding but can she win Drake's love?Connor Drake has always thought of Payton as a little girl, a tomboy. But when he glimpses her in all her finery he is shocked. Payton has grown up into a beautiful young woman.Patricia Cabot has written a fast paced book set on the high seas and exotic locations, surely to please the reader. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent follow-up to the Ragged Astronauts,"Toller is back as a restless, well known legendary figure, 24 years after war and calamity on Land made him a hero. After escaping to Overland, the twin planet, he has settled down to a quiet life. He welcomes a new chance for adventure when a small band of survivors that remained on Land, have come to Overland to claim it as their own. The story reveals what they have become, and how an alien race from a third planet helped to create them. The book is taken up with the new battle between Land and Overland, and then with another adventure to Farland, the mysterious third planet in the system. It is not as exciting or as suspenseful as the first book, but it is still filled with great visual scenes and memorable characters. It is well written and entertaining to the end. These books were a great contribution to the field by Shaw."
4,great album... FATA comes out strong again,"this album is, from start to finish, simply awesome. I still can't believe how much these guys have taken off, and even though their new label does make them sound more polished (vagrant does that to everyone), they still totally rock out. Only reason i give 4/5 stars is cuz Fran needs to give the mike more to Ben... he's gotta have one of the sickest screams in music today, and to me, that's really what makes FATA shine. While Fran's vocals are cool, there's a billion bands out there that sound like that; more harmonizing or something. All in all definitely worth your $$ though"
5,Mind Blowing,"This is a masterpiece from front to back....i just saw them live with atreyu and they rocked....Francis is a god of a drummer..i mean he is just drop dead amazing at the skins....although this isnt as hardcore as TBYB that doesnt mean it isnt as good..i actually liked ""Autumns Monologue"" its still FATA and i am looking forward to there next cd....Best Tracks:""Milligram Smile"", ""After Dinner Payback"", and ""Autumns Monologue"""
2,its alright....,"i bought this cd after hearing the song ""take her to the music store"" off of their first album, and let's just say i was disappointed. i mean some of the songs on here are alright, but the soft ones are horrible. save yourself the trouble and just buy their first one ""too bad you're beautiful."""
1,Dissapointing...,"i really was excited about the release of this, beecuase i loved ""too bad your beautiful"" but i was sorely dissapointed in this album...its boring and monotonus. its just run of the mill emo-core, and it is no fun to listen to at all. listen to some a static lullaby, alexisonfire, or some underoath insted of this, theres so much better than this out there."
3,sophmore curse,"ok....this cd doesnt necessarily SUCK, but i must say their first cd (too bad your beautiful) hardly does this cd justice...the fiction we live has heavy (ish) music, though, nothing compared to their first cd, their lyrics are not so original, nor is the actual music, they have 2 songs on the fiction we live that sound just like ""chloroform perfume"" from their debut album...obviously it was intentional, as one of the songs is called the response to autumns monologue..but its not as unique as what was hoped for...i wouldnt say dont buy it, but its definitly downhill from their first cd"
1,Dreadful band.,"FATA sound like one guy giving another guy head while getting raped by a cheese grater, set to music. Only with worse lyrics.Thank you."
1,dissapointing....,"f a t a, is one of those bands that all the songs sounds pretty much mediocre...Especialy the singin its terrible---the lirycs are dumb andvery boring sound put together. I even regret having to waste my time listining to this crap. Don't buy it!"
1,more like From Autumn To....... TRASHES !!!,"the drummer is a girl, the singer is fat and has a stupid beard, i dont like this."
5,LOVE IT,"If you are just getting into Age of Empires, this game is great for starters! This is how I started. And I have loved it ever since! :D I love the third better though and hope they come out with a fourth soon!"
3,It's not THAT bad,"This collection showcases some of the most sparkling music of the last 150 years. However, this recording has no sparkle. It is pleasant. Nice. Hummable. Eminently familiar. Even fun. But listening to this makes you realize that a great orchestra and a great conductor have a role to play. And this CD has neither.There is nothing wrong here, and it is a wonderful packaging of a number of Scandinavian tunes, but for definitive recordings, you'll have to go elsewhere. It lacks the zip and charm that this effervescent (and, let's face it, not great) music needs."
3,Older than the woods.,"When I ordered this book, I expected something new and up-to-date with great illustrations of types of traps and methods of doing things. Little did I suspect that what I would receive would be a book published in 1895 with one of the main focuses being on a trap-type that is currently illegal where I live: the steel-jawed trap. Also, there was not much depth or illustration given to the real intent of my purchase: snares and snaring. I guess it really is true: there is nothing new under the sun, and my expectation of new methods was unfounded precisely because there ARE no new methods for trapping. If you're looking for detailed explanations of things you can do to take game (and which might still be legal) look elsewhere!Dominic Ebacherebacherdom.blogspot.com"
5,Excellent product,Simple installation and so minimalist that it looks like an expensive light. Throws a lot of light and great for our basement because the finished ceilings are kind of low.
4,Good Catalog,"This was a very fun ""coffee table"" book and I've had lots of comments on it. Also, several friends liked it and purchased one."
4,Nice Driver,"Nice driver, perfect size, not to heavy, powerful, gets the job done. Make sure you have at least two battery's if your using it a lot."
4,Good storage unit,It is a little bit smaller than I thought it would be but it still works great and holds enough xmas decorations for me. The other reviews about the cardboard are true too. I put some bubble rap on the bottom of each section and it works great. It adds just enough cushioning that I really am not worried about anything breaking.
1,Broken when received,This item was broken when I received it. The product was in the box without any packaging pr protection. So it seemed to me that it would break every time I would have to order it. I decided it was not worth it and just got my money back.
4,Great storage box,I was very pleased with the storage box. I ordered two and they easily stack together. The snap is a little hard to open but you don't have to do it often. Very fast shipping!
5,Great movies,"Great set of dvds, made my friend very happy. If you are a Gardel fan, these are the movies you must see."
5,Too cute for words!,"You know how kids want you to read the same book over and over and over again? Well, with this one, you'll actually enjoy it!"
1,Don't Purchase From Nutricity,"This company, Nutricity, is totally uninterested in providing explanations or customer service. I placed an order through Amazon on June 3rd. It is now June 17th and I still have not received my order. I recommend using Vitacost.com, their prices are lower and you can rely on the fact that you will receive your order in 4 to 5 days. I will not use Amazon if they continue to do business with this company. The product is fine, I like it."
2,Eh,I didn't notice any difference after taking this (four a day) for a couple weeks. I got it because I am cold all the time and this is supposed to increase circulation. I will not reorder.
2,Not the Concert!,When I bought this I thought I was getting the concert.WRONG!!!!All this is 3 disks of album reviews up to Back in Black.
4,so far it's very interesting,"My GYN recommended that I pick up this book. I am skipping around, reading the sections that interest me, and so far I find it very interesting, humorous, and good information. It helps me to think of questions about supplements, hormones, etc. that I can ask my doctor about next time I see her."
2,I Do Believe I'm Feeling Older Every Day,"It will be a shame if Chicago will be remembered solely for their AOR songs of the 80s. This was one of the most innovative bands of the 60s and 70s, particularly with the incorporation of brass into rock music. This collection is a mixture of all periods of their music. The big question for this group is, are they still capable of writing another 25 or 6 to 4 or will they become part of the county fair oldies circuit? Unfortunately, I think I already know the answer."
4,Good Starting Point,"I like this book. It was a big help for me to get started with Weblogic Workshop. I found it to be organized pretty well and the information extremely helpful.I would recommend this book to someone that wanted to get started quickly with Workshop. But one problem is by the time I got this book and created Web Services with 7.0 then Weblogic 8.1 hit the market.Also, the BEA documentation is very good and I could have probably gotten by using their resources. However, the amount of documentation and detail is overwhelming. I found this book helpful as well as an excellent starting point for WebServices and Workshop."
3,Not as great as people say,"This WCW PPV from 1994 is good but definitely overrated. The tag team title match with Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan challenging the Nasty Boys is a spectacular streetfight that is the best match on the card. Vader vs. Sting and Flair vs. Windham are both good but nothing really all that special. Other matches are Steve Austin vs. Johnny B. Badd (Marc Mero) -- a good but overlong match that is way too slow at some points, Steven Regal vs. Larry Zbysco in a pretty boring technical match, Terry Funk vs. Tully Blanchard in a ""legends"" match that is starting to get really good before it ends in a double countout, and Dustin Runnels vs. Bunkhouse Buck in an absolutely awful brawl. Overall, Spring Stampede '94 is not as great as many people say it is, but it is still a good show and definitely worth buying for 10 bucks. So if you are a wrestling fan and you have 10 bucks, there's no reason not to buy this tape."

1,Too Many Errors,"I bought this hoping to brush up on my Chem before continuing with my degree. However I rely on answers being CORRECT - otherwise how are you supposed to know if you missed something? I ran into several issues within the first 2 sections and thought maybe I misunderstood something. Then when I saw the ANSWER claiming 5,000,000 / 6.02x10^23 = 8.3x10^23 I knew this book had not been checked for errors at all. How can you miss a change in exponents? I have found MANY, MANY errors in this book in only the first 2 sections. I could excuse these if Barron's had an errata page I could print out, but alas I can't find anything. It's a well written book and I'd rate it much higher if the answers were correct. If you are unsure of your math or chem, look elsewhere. If you are certain of your skills, then you probably don't need this book anyway."
4,Playwrights at Work Succeeds,"This book is excellent for teachers of theatre, or really for anyone who is interested in the inner workings of a playwright. Its only down-fall is that the playwrights themselves were sometimes less than forth-coming with answers we all want to know: HOW DOES THE PLAY GET ON THE PAGE??? However, it is very interesting in that we get into the heads of some very famous playwrights and shows us a personal side. I could barely put it down because I've read and taught these playwrights for years, but now have personal insight into their work and lives."
3,Unseemingly Williams,The service and quality of the dvd were excellent. Viewing Robin Williams in anything other than a comedy is a little disconcerting.
3,Engrossing but ultimately disappointing,"As others have found, I was quickly drawn into this novel, turning pages and staying up past my bedtime to make headway. However, I finished the book wondering, ""is that it?""Several key things seem implausible to me. For an admittedly overprotective mom to drag Shane to the Dark Continent not once, but twice, was completely beyond belief. Malik is key to Helen's movement through Congo, yet no money exchanges hands. The Congo is full of generous people, but Malik would hardly abandon his family and his business to help a white woman without significant financial motivation.I was also disappointed that the book ended so abruptly, though I don't want to spoil by commenting on the scene.I feel a bit like I ordered Haagen Daaz and got lowfat fro yo instead-- I expected more. Good premise, though."
5,Dream of Me/Believe in Me,"I could not put this book down! Wolf is the hero of every womans heart! Believe in me is not as great as the first, but it still kicks butt! So far no book by Josie Litton has disappointed me! I would recommend this author to any woman who truely loves a great romance novel!"
4,Ooohlalaah...is this Viking hot or what?,"of course im referring to Wolf in Dream of Me. he's just the sort of guy that you'd want to cuddle up to. actually, he reminds me so much of the heroes in julie garwood's historical romances--gruff, dangerous to his enemies, but such a lily-liver when it comes to his wife. and Cymbra is simply adorable. they are perfect for each other.Dream of Me is such a beautifully written story. There's enough passion, romance, and humor to make it a keeper in your shelf.Believe in Me is somehow eclipsed by the former story. there were times when i was left wondering where the tender humor has gone. the hero is somehow more subdued and not as compelling as Wolf. i felt too that this follow-up story was written in haste. BUT, all-in-all, it still aint bad. the tumultuous emotional quandary that the heroine feels driven to overcome was wonderfully depicted by Ms. Litton."
5,Amazing!! It doesn't fall out of your ear,"I really like this unit. It hangs nicely in my ear. It feels like it'll fall off, but it doesn't. Good connection, easy to use. I can hear the other party very well, and they can hear me with no problem neither."
3,I'm only doing this for homework,"The scene that I liked the most was when Cyd fell in love woth Louis. It was realli cute in a way on how Cyd flirted with him and made him attracted to her.The characters in this story...from what I think was well thought of.I have no kind of personal connection with any of these characters...none are really like me.The only thing I didn't like about this book was on how Rachel had talked about the GAY situation. The gay part just bothers me.I don't get on how gay people are accepted, like as a part of life. If I had a gay brother, i would of probably of murdered him.Cyd is a funnt (well,sort of) and attractive girl."
4,great book,Gingerbread is a great book about a girl who hasn't seen her dad since she was a kid. when she finally does see him again every thing is different. Read this book
5,Gingerbread for all,This was an incredibly amazing book. It was well-written and very relatedable. I can understand by some of the other reviews that adults tried to read it and didnt really like it. Well guess what? it was meant for teenagers to relate to not older people. I've told everyone i know to read this book and now im telling you- yes you- to buy/read it too! It told the lives of very interesting characters (w/ extremely strange names) and the challenges they face along the road of life. I have added this book to my list of must reads for teenagers! but i warn you now that anyone under 12 and over 23 should probably steer clear of this book!!
5,This book has sat in the back of my mind for 20yrs,"I read this book about 20 yrs ago. I can remember checking it out at the library. I can remember being totally engrossed. I can remember the stairs and the food machines. All of the details are gone, but I can remember exactly how it felt to read it. Whenever anyone asks me for a young adult recommendation I think, ""I wish I could remember the title of that book.I'm remodeling my home and I did a search for ""stairs."" There it was. It must have been a great book if I can still feel it 20 yrs later."
3,Better construction than cheap models-it still broke.,"This adapter appears stronger than the cheaper units I tried earlier. Some broke the first time I used them. The 1/2"" male part snaps in like a socket extension, so I hope it is replaceable if it does break.EDIT- This one broke, also.I would be happy to buy the removable male part, that is where it broke. If those are available, please post message."
3,Nice but rather heavy...,"I bought this watch, it was advertised as unisex but unless you are a big girl it is way too big! It weighs over 200grams, which is about a half pound. It is spectacular! Very impressive and a compliment getter. I figure that it is like lifting weights and looking good at the same time. I would buy again but next time it would be nice to know how huge it is before I buy."
1,Do yourself a favor and....,"burn this CD. whatever you do, don't believe the hype. it's really not a great CD. nor is it even good. calling it fair might even be an overstatement. 30% of the album consists of actual music with vocals while the remaining 70% is primarily underproduced experimental instrumentation not at all worthy of being called a ""perfect pop record"". lest we forget that there are two kinds of pop: pop[ular] pop such as Stacie Orrico or Justin Timberlake and real pop, the latter basing itself around melodies, harmonies and relatively catchy rhythms which this album doesn't come remotely close to any of those. it is boring and not even in a satisfying way. I bought this CD on a whim cos I was a sucker for the hype that surrounded it. the buzz is defintely unwarranted. the pretentious title also seems like a lame attempt to promote democracy. thank you."
1,A breezy tone of voice makes even epithets appealing!,"Give me a break. Just the name ""Broken Social Scene"" hints at how this music is artsy fartsy bullsh*t. And if that doesn't hit you over the head like a ton of bricks, just look at the snobbish, trendy song titles. With a song like ""I'm still Your [...] on this album, I see that homophobic epithets (as long as they're spoken in a breezy, wispy tone of voice) are unfortunately still OK to use (just make sure you lie and call your homophobia something like a ""valid artistic statement of expression"").Go buy some music that has the balls to admit it's nothing more than something worth enjoying (and no, [...], I didn't say ""savor the flavors""). Broken Social Scene is for people who like to turn their noses up at everyone and whine about how ""miserable"" their lives are. Chew on this while you sip your expresso lattes annd smoke your cancer sticks."
1,Instant Record Collection,"..inasmuch as every song could be by a different band. You know how when you listen to a college station and you hear some great stuff, but you have to wait 30 minutes for the dj to tell you what it was? Well, this is like that, only it's one of those segments in the show where you didn't change the dial, but you really couldn't give a toss who the bands were you just listened to. All the comparisons with other bands made by the other reviewers are spot on - just this isn't as good as any of them. A reminder of the downside of the indie revolution, and a reminder to myself of why I don't buy too mnay records out of curiosity these days. Watch out for it in the ""used"" section soon!"
5,Sorry I waited so long to listen,"Amazon kept on reccommending this album to be, based on other stuff I have bought. I always kinda blew it off, because they have been wrong, very wrong before (i.e. Mercury Rev's All is Dream). I got the Wicker Park soundtrack which is pretty good, but the ""Lover's Spit"" song on that album by Broken Social Scene as more addicting than heroin (...). I quickly got this album and reget not getting it earlier. It is very good. It is pretty mellow and over half the album is instrumental, but nevertheless it is dominating my life's soundtrack rotation as of now. It isn't perfect, but the genius on most of the songs make us overly generious on the others. I think there is still the possiblity of many people not liking it, but I think most open-minded folk will fall for this album."
2,This book wasn't right for me,"Although there is a vast amount of information in this book, I didn't feel that this book was going to be very helpful for me. The main problem for me was that this book is too grounded in a western medical background. For instance, the author states the standard western position that multiple sclerosis is incurable but with symptoms that can be controlled. In my opinion, when someone says that something is ""incurable"" what they really mean is that they don't understand the root causes of the disease. In my further opinion, it is irresponsible to declare that something is ""incurable"" as it closes people off to the possibility that they could successfully cure themselves. Returning to the example of MS, there are many people who have successfully cured themselves by treating and clearing their underlying toxicity problems. Because of this fundamental disagreement in philosophy between myself and the author, I returned the book."
4,A great book for young revolutionaries.,"I am glad that I picked up this book. I was interested in learning about the BPP, so when I saw this book I bought it. The book gives an interesting account of what the BPP was about, and who the ""cadre"" were. I must recommend this for any revolutionary"
4,Great -so many choices,"This video has a customize option that allows you to choose 1 mile- 5miles & also different specialty sessions (abs, arms, etc.) I like that each mile is separate with a increase/decrease....it makes for a bit easier of a work out for me. If you're looking for a full on 5 mile work out I think you're better off with her other videos that treat the 5 miles as one session with increase/decrease once. On this video if you choose 5 miles it's like 5 1-mile workouts with increase/decrease 5 times."
4,"Good, steady sweat!","I thought this DVD would be a breeze and a nice break from my Biggest Loser collection but I was mistaken! If you only complete the 1 mile then it's not very difficult but your heart definitely beats. Now, if you do 2-3 miles then you're seriously breaking a sweat (at least in my case) I enjoyed the simplicity of this DVD and I enjoy Leslie's voice and motivation."
1,"This is cotton, NOT flax","Flax is the plant to produce the material linen. Most modern ""linen"" is actually made out of cotton, as is this. The term flax in the title is just silly."
2,It is an OK toy,"I bought these for my daughter because I read so many wonderful things about the toy in terms of development. While my daughter (now 4 months) will look at the shapes, she doesn't seem all that interested in them. She will hold one for a few seconds and then just throws them aside. They are too big for her to do much with. She has been more interested in the other Manhattan Baby toys that I purchased for her, such as Mr. Whoozit. She likes to grab and reach so big shapes just don't do it for her."
1,The worst game in the history of games!!!,"DO NOT buy this game, don't even take it if it's free. I have a computer that is 3 times as better as they listed in the requirements, and the game is almost unplayable (laggs way more than the first one). The game has more features comparing to the first one, but it's worthless when you can't even play it. The menues are fine, all the options are fine, but when you try to take a ride... you're screwed. I lowered the resolution to the least that I could (538 x 340) with low texture details and shadow settings off, it still lagged. It's not worth the furstration. In this game I see so much potential, but no results; I'm very dissapointed."
2,Most unsubtle,"I'm afraid I must add a resounding 'No!' to this most unsubtle of Beethovens which not even some fine piano playing by the young Stefan Vladar is able to save. The orchestra seems to want to cover its manifest weaknesses with sheer volume; the acoustics are so awful that I wondered for a while if the CD had been recorded in an empty swimming-bath rather than a concert hall; and the BÃ¶sendorfer grand piano is somehow superimposed on the orchestra in a way that makes it sound bigger than the whole orchestra, the balance between the instruments thus being totally ignored. A comparison with Melvyn Tan and the London Classical Players directed by Sir Roger Norrington showed that there is no comparison, i. e. Tan and co. are incomparably better."
2,"weak story, disappointing art","I am a big fan of both azzarello and lee, but this book disappoints. The story is a weak story that tries to be profound and significant. At the end, it offers nothing new to the Superman mythos and in time, it will not stand out at all as one of the better stories. Lee's art is good, but very average here. Nothing jumps out at the reader, but just simple poses and misleading snapshots. Lots of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Also, this is definitely the comic industry's tactic to sell lots and lots of issues. The story could have been easily told in 6 or eight issues, but ended up being 12 issues."
3,"ARTWORK IS GREAT, just about it..","JIM LEE ROCKS!! However, I am sorry to say that the story is lackluster. I have the original collection in comic book form and the art is what saves this collection. The story kind of starts like a ""LEFT BEHIND"" then it ends loke a bad sci-fi flick. The ending was weak even with Zod's appearance.Note to publishers: STOP MAKING MULTIPLE COVERS TO MAKE MORE MONEY."
4,"boring, but incredibly useful","When we were planning our trip to Japan, we purchased The Rough Guide to Japan and The Lonely Planet Guide to Tokyo. Reading through the Lonely Planet Guide, I found very little that sounded worth doing or seeing. The same items described in The Rough Guide were much more intriguing. So I chose what to see and do based on The Rough Guide.Close to the time of our trip, someone who had just been to Japan recommended The Time Out Guide to Tokyo for the maps. But when it came time for planning the details of the tour - where the chosen attractions were located, when they were open, and how to get from here to there, the maps and the details in the descriptions in The Lonely Planet Guide were far more useful than those in the other two books. For practical use, I have given this book four stars."
1,I don't recommend it,"Not only have I had the drive fail after a crash, losing all data, at this point a gig HD is so cheap, I can't think of why someone would buy this today."
3,useful but must be taken with a grain of salt,"Somewhat disappointing for a LP guide, lots of text but not as much ""meat"". After travelling in the Solomons and talking with others one gets the impression that the author did quite limited travelling throughout the islands and largely relied on other's reports. The hike to Mataniko Falls is way more strenuous and dangerous than hinted. (It is still an awesome sight, especially if you're a caver) Likewise a hike along the Weather Coast is more challenging than one would gather from the text, there are places where villagers go by boat because of the vertical exposure. Makira Island is only marginal habitat for salt-water crocodiles according to a Conservation International report and not as abundant as stated in the guide. Given the dearth of information about the Solomons it is still worth buying, but prudence is recommended."
5,Best Value for your dollar...Ooops I mean penny,I brought the bundle for $0.67 because my better half can't find the original items that came with the Creative Zen Vision M unit after our move. I have no complaints about the sync charge cable or the travel wall charger. Haven't tried the car adapter yet. Shipping was on the high side so buy the bundle. It actually balances out less than getting a single replacement part from Creative.
1,This is NOT a data cable!,The information listed in this review is incorrect. This cable is a USB charger ONLY. It is NOT a data transfer cable.
5,Finally!,This is the cable that should have been included with the Creative products to begin with. It fits my Zen Vision M much more snugly that the original adapter piece.
1,Awful,"I struggled to read Easy last summer and I hated it. The main character just seemed too desperate and I didn't like her at all.Comparing this book to Jemima J and Bridget Jones is completely wrong because Jemima J and Bridget Jones were both likeable, funny characters and Easy had none of that. I recommend that you skip this book and read a Sophie Kinsella, Jane Green, or Helen Fielding book instead."
1,Just An Abstract,"This is only an abstract of an article, nothing else. It lists the contacts and departments involved in arranging the JV, but nothing else of note. 1688 words total."
3,how can a diary be rated as a bbok?,"the basketball diaries is nothing more than the story of one man and his hardships. There are thousands of stories not unlike Pete Carrol's and although this was well written, is is nothing more than a diary. true writing can be more respected when it is fictional, showing there is an obvious creative process. this is not creative"
5,Superb Interpretations,"I usually have short lapses where my mind wanders when I listen to chamber music. Last night, rather late, I played this CD. What a revelation to hear such beautiful music. My mind did not wander but went from one beautiful movement to another! I listened to the complete trio and noted that the second movement was music that I had heard and enjoyed from the movie soundtrack, Barry Lyndon. The musicians who make up this trio are excellent. Well integrated sound. The CD has a middle of the hall perspective with well balanced instruments. This group has another Schubert Trio and some Beethoven Trios CD's which I ordered the morning after. strongly Recommended!"
4,Henry and Mudge's Review,I think this is a very good book because it describes the fun-filled adventures Henry and Mudge have in full detail. What I mostly liked about the book was the vocabulary the author uses. The author uses simple words that everyone can understand so that people of all ages can join in on Henry and Mudge's good times.
3,Different Drifters,"At first I felt ""ripped off"" when the lead singer gave a whole new sound to the Drifter recordings I had been used to hearing in the 1960's(not too different so it still had a Drifter feel);however,I grew to like the new sound as much or more for some of the selections.If you want pure Drifters,order""The Very Best Of The Drifters.""Don't order""Best Of Ben E. King""which has a total of 10 songs,most of which I never heard of."
4,GREAT SPEAKERS FOR THE PRICE,"For the price I paid a year ago (maybe $10 TOPS) these little speakers are awesome. You can recharge the battery, it comes with two sets of cables; one for connecting it to a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and another for connecting older phones with those smaller jacks (don't know the size). Can get decently loud considering it is the size of a second generation LG Chocolate. Did I mention they cost barely anything? I use them at work in the dining hall dishroom and at my outdoor summer job, both of which are loud. SO if you're looking for portability and and ability to listen to your music (not looking for excellent high mid or bass) these are great."
2,portable speakers,"although these speakers are easy to use, their sound quality if fair, at best. i like the idea of very small portable i-pod speakers, but i am looking for something with greater sound quality."
4,great basic info for eating well on the trail.....,"I enjoyed this book very much, and after realizing that some of the images(suggesting one hold a piece of friut leather up to the sun to form a pretty,natural stained glass window)are meant to be more aesthetic than practical, I was able to glean some great advice and guidance. One note of caution: The item list for emergency backpacking food rations was good, provided you can employ six husky Sherpas to carry it all. All in all,a very good book for anyone interested in delving deeper into the art and science of eating well on the trail...."
5,Well-fed,"Of all the sources of backpacking recipies that I have found, this is by far the best. Not only are most of the recipies reasonable, easy and tasty, but her many suggestions regarding saving money and easy planning are terrific."
5,The Hungry Backpacker,This is a must have book for the backpacker. It is full of great recipes and cooking hints. I would recommend this to anyone packing thier own food.
5,"You cook, I wash","We have a great time with this gem of a book. When backpacking, you normally avoid additional weight. This book is worth carrying. Each of us has favorite recipes we cook. I am no longer head chef and the pride my kids have in making a great meal is very rewarding. Highly recommended."
3,Expected for price,"It is a fairly good hatIt had a funny smell though, had to febreze it acouple of times"
2,"Not ""long"", not durable","2 weeks of use and the seam has worn off. I mean, not that i care very much,its a freaking 2 dollar hat, cmon, but uh... just so you know. And well i didntfind it that long, but again, whatever... 2 dollar beanie, man."
2,Don't waste your money,"I received these bags as a shower gift and they looked really cute in the package. When I took them out, they had a very strong chemical odor so I washed them in cold and dried them on the counter in my laundry room. They completely rolled up and I could not get them to flatten out or fold to put them in my diaper bag. In their current state, they just take up too much room. I haven't used them at all, ziploc bags are just so much more convenient. I gave them two stars instead of one because I think I might use them when we travel this summer, maybe in the beach bag. I feel like I should find a use for them because they are not cheap. Bottom line, save your money and just buy a box of gallon Ziplocs."
3,baby enjoys mobile!,"My son didn't really enjoy or even notice the mobile till about 2 mo. old. I think if I had a mobile in his crib that played music or moved he might have enjoyed it sooner. But now at 3 mo. he stares at this mobile, giggles, smiles and really enjoys it. It gives me 10 min. in the morning to shower and get ready which is much needed! I started out with just the black and whites and added the colored cards in recently."
3,Difficult to change pictures,"I like that this mobile is not over-stimulating like most mobiles. My daughter really enjoyed it from about one month old to four months old at which time she became disinterested.A major drawback for me is that it is very difficult to change the images. It takes time, effort, and sore hands to interchange the pictures.Overall, I would still probably prefer this mobile to more traditional mobiles that have loud music and less stimulating objects to look at, like small stuffed animals."
5,Great,"This mobile is classically beautiful without the use of overstimulating, ugly toys spinning around making obnoxious music! It creates enough of a stimulating experience for baby to entertain without creating sensory overload.The hanging pics can occasionally fall off if the mobile is bumped, which is annoying sometimes, but it is nice to be able to switch out the pictures."
3,Wish it had more,"I wanted to get a mobile for my 1 month old and after doing a little research I decided to get this one. She is now 3 months old and likes looking at this mobile, but it will only hold her attention if we spin it.I have 2 complaints about this mobile:1) I wish the parts were more durable.2) I wish the company had thought to make a version that spins slowly. I like the fact that it does not have music, but a little motion would increase the appeal of this mobile for our child.If you are a new parent you could skip the mobile altogether. It is not an essential."
3,Baby became bored quickly,"I was initially intrigued by this mobile's low-tech simplicity, but it did not keep my son's interest for very long. I ended up clipping the WF art cards to another electronic mobile."
3,Wonderful product.,"I love this product and so does my baby. It has lots of different pictures, so you can always change it so you're baby doesn't get bored. My old complaint is the picture cards seem like they could eventually break. The cards have a tab on the edge that slips into a slit in another card, the tab bends very easy and it seems like after lots of bending and changing of the cards it could come off, but that's the only complaint I have. I sometimes hear my daughter cooing and ""talking"" to it when she's laying her her crib."
4,Great,"I didnt have any issues with the cards wripping, and thought it was a great product. My little newbie LOVES looking at it and I would tell every mom to get one of these. My only complaint, I have to ""Jimmy Rig"" it to stay on the side of his pack and play or bassinet... It would be nice if it wasnt built just to go in between slats on the crib."
2,Broke while putting it together!,"Straight out of the box I wasn't impressed by how completely cheap this product is. What a shame too, it definitely looks like a neat thing for a baby to look at. Upon constructing it (and trying very hard to be gentle while getting badly cut pieces to fit together), it snapped with little effort. The plastic used on this is so thin that it really worries me what would happen if the baby just happened to grab this thing. It would quickly become a chocking hazard.The cards are also very cheaply made. I considered just keeping the cards for the baby to look at in some way (haven't figured out how yet), but I don't think I'd just hand them to the baby to play with. Again, they'd probably break just as easily.I'll be looking for a similar style mobile and hopefully I can find one that is much better quality. This thing isn't worth the money, unfortunately."
2,A Skipper,The enjoyment of listening is interrupted constantly by skips in the CD's. I was looking so forward to chillin' with the Nitty Gritty but the pleasure is not to be had with this set!
2,Major-label package is only sporadically brilliant,"Sporadically brilliant, yet frustratingly inconsistent, Nick Cave's eleven albums bury flashes of bleak inspiration amid stretches of unconvincing Southern Gothic posturing and dreary crooning. BEST OF privileges ballads like ""Straight to You"" and pop misfires like ""Deanna"" over scorching essays in domestic depravity and spiritual despair like ""Jack the Ripper"" and ""City of Refuge"" (from HENRY'S DREAM and TENDER PREY, respectively). The radio-ready schmaltz of ""The Ship Song"" (1990) and ""Into my Arms"" (1997) marks the descent of the former Birthday Party screamer from an agent of chaos to a sort of Harry Chapin for aging Goths. A proper retrospective of Cave's most raw-boned demon blues could stun a mule at twenty paces, but this major-label package ain't it. 1993's LIVE SEEDS captures Cave closer to his prime. --Michael Draine (first appeared in Vendetta #11)"
4,Nick is nick,"Nick is no holds barred in your face with whatever the diatribal story he wants to throw down.Having said that, I like his work very much. My issue with Nick is that he never leaves a pie in sky/pastoral/dirty context and becomes something else. I mean it's either over the top or under the bottom.The mood issue with Nick fuels his ability. He is certainly incredible, and worth it. Will he ever change enough to put out something that changes the world, not just himself and malcontents? Time will tell... This greatest hits shows where he has been for a time.Matthew Hahn, www.movingtracks.com"
2,Bad Seeds,THis music takes a very specific flavor. Takes many listens to get used to. Not like anything else.
5,BUY IT!,"This CD is just perfect! ""The weeping song"", ""The mercy seat"", ""Tupelo"" and ""Do you love me?"" are just some of the amazing songs on this CD. I kinda miss the songs ""Up jumped the devil"" from the album ""Tender prey"" and ""There is a kingdom"" from ""Boatmans call"", because I think that's some great songs, but the album is great even without them! If you don't have it, BUY IT NOW!"
2,Not a classic,"Someone called this ""classic BNL"". No it is not. There is nothing that makes this memorable. It is no stunt. Heck, it is no Maroon. I find myself skipping thru tracks often. I can't say I do that with any other BNL records, except the sister cd to this.I hope that they get back on track on their next trip to the studio. Maybe they spent too much time on this one, and screwed it up by thinking too much."
3,This is Companion Album from Downloaded BLAM,"This disc has some interesting and playful tunes on it. For those who bought BLAM online through iTunes, this is the ""bonus"" disc that was included at the time of that purchase. If you already own that, no need to buy this one again. If you don't and are a BNL fan, this is worth owning (but not up to the caliber of ""Maybe You Should Drive"" or ""Gordon"")."
3,Track Listing Information,1 I Got The Vibration (Lelewel Freak Mix) (2:56)2 Positive Vibration (Kamasutra Funky Club) (6:09)3 Positive Vibration (Lelewel Summer Breeze Mix) (6:20)4 Positive Vibration (Miami By Night Parts 1-2) (7:43)
4,Great drumming holds together this trippy Art Rock delight,"I had just been listening to some 60s stuff when Broken Spirit arrived: Small Faces, Pink Floyd, Spirit, The Who, so I was ready for new sounds in a similar vein. The drumming was particularly powerful, elegant and articulate, holding the songs together. Lazy drummers can break a band. Lead singer takes some getting used to; he sounds strained at times (hence, 4 stars not 5). Reverb and other trippy effects vibrated my whole house, very lush, lots of fun! Glad they are exploring a genre which surprisingly still holds a lot of promise. I would consider this to be Art Rock, definitely homage to Pink Floyd. I look forward to further efforts."
1,The Mantle of the Prophet,"This book is a piece of crap. I am currently studying the history of Iran and using this book as a main textbook. I have not met anyone who has enjoyed this book so far, and this book only makes me appalled by Iranian history. How can a country's history be so boring? Or is it just the stupid author that makes it insipid? With all the revolutions that happened in Iran, I think the latter. I was really excited to learn more about the history of Iran, for it has become such a controversial nation last few years, but now, I am very much disgusted by my stupidest decision. Also the author mumbles everywhere and does not focus. He needs to find a big goddamn idea and weave everything together. With these being said, I give the author credit because I sincerely believe that no other writer can write something this tedious than he can. I should have taken Chinese history class when my friend told me to. I knew Kung-Pao chicken always tasted better than falafels."
1,Lacie's are BAD NEWS,I had a 500Gig crash on me within a year. I bought this 250 as a replacement. Out of the box it was unfunctional and made the weirdest sounds I've ever heard. I sent it to Lacie and they sent it back to me no different. I'm not using Lacie anymore - too much is at stake. I loved the way they looked and stacked but I'm WAY OVER it. Lacie no more.
4,So edible they are incredible!,Nature's Path Toaster Pastries are worth every bite. I selected the blueberry and strawberry and have not been disappointed. I have even shared them with some of the people I work with and the results are in:'Excellent'!!
3,Wow!! The price sure went up!!,"I did a subscribe and save on this in Dec. 2010, and paid $16.29. They are good, but not good enough to pay more than double the price!!! Yikes!!"
1,Phair fan...run and hide!,"A complete train wreck. Whip-Smart and Exile in Guyville to this? Don't beleive any of the good reviews on this album...rarely does a sell out make it so apparent to the world. Liz, I never thought you would be the one to take the dive."
2,"The Self Titled, but No Liz","I never knew who Liz Phair was before ""Why Can't I?"", but I was hooked to her since. I did get the self titled, but along with her debut album Exile In Guyville. I loved the self-titled, but the debut album just blew for me. But after a while I started to like Exile more and more, soon I got her other albums and got the rarities on the internet, but I soon realized something. Liz wrote excellent songs in the beginning, but her ability was slowly declining with each record.The self titled strays so far from any of the other albums that is should not even be considered part of the same family. The album would be good if Liz had not decided to suck up the lyrics babbling on about sex and etc. She did talk about these things in earlier albums but she was much smarter about it. Her clever lyrics run dry in this album. The only reason you should have this album is if you need to complete your Liz collection, or if you are obsessed with ""Why Can't I?"" and ""Extraordinary."""
4,"expected more, but still great","To be honest, i've expected more from Liz, as many others out there did. however, just because Liz changed her music style a bit, and some even say similar to Avril Lavigne, it's not fair to say that her music isn't worthwhile. Her music is still somewhere above Lavigne (though i have to say that this album sounds like a debut). Personally, I like the first half of the album, and the best track i think is Extraordinary. Rock me is another great song, Red light fever as well. though the first single Why can't I was a bit of a disappointment. Favorite is a chic song and little digger's great too. So even Liz has gone mainstream, it doesn't mean that this is a bad album. it's worth the money buying it, and Liz is still rockin'."
4,Liz Always Rocks,"By far Exile in Guyville was my favorite CD that Liz ever made, but I also love all of her others! It just seems that no matter what Liz does, she can never do wrong. This new CD is by far milder than her past three, but still what I consider great music. I wouldn't give it five stars because it still isn't her best, but I would recommend it if you are a true Liz fan."
1,OVERRATED ARTIST,WHY ANYONE STILL CARES ABOUT LIZ PHAIR IS BEYOND ME.. SHE MADE SOME MINOR HEADWAVES WITH HER FIRST RECORD.. IT SHOCKED SOME WITH HER EXPLICIT LYRICS.. SHE IS AN OK ROCKER - WHIP SMART WAS A PRETTY GOOD RECORD - BUT HER VOICE HAS ALWAYS SUCKED.. SHE IS DOING THE SAME SCHTICK SHE DID YEARS AGO ONLY NOW ITS OVERPRODUCED.. IRRITATING THAT THERE IS NEW HYPE FOR HER ONLY BECAUSE BIG LABEL IS PUSHING HER - WOULD NOT RECCOMEND UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY SOLD ON HER..
2,Garishly overpainted,"As a long time Liz fan, I've been looking forward to this album since 'Whitechocolatespaceegg'. And while it took me a little while to warm up to that album, I don't anticipate warming up to this one at all. It is entirely overproduced. The clever, insightful lyrics typical of Liz have been drowned out by a heavy dose of Pop-formula studio tricks. The most frustrating aspect of the album is that you get a key for an online EP called 'Come and Get It' that does not suffer from expensive studio time. Instead you get the lyrics, voice & guitar work of Liz raw, like we're used to. But you can only listen to the songs on an internet-connected computer. Release the songs as-is & I'll pay for them. Though I'd rather trade in the 14 song 'Liz Phair' release straight up for the 4 song EP."
2,Liz...Liz...Liz.....,"Liz's latest album is practicably intolerable. Such a fine artist has chosen now to wade in the end of shallowness. A huge admirer of her previous work, this album is pathetic. Only a handful of well written tracks that resemble the talented Liz that we know of are present out of the 14 on this record. The rest sound like the worst 1980's metal band you could ever imagine. Very sad indeed."
2,I gave it away to my friend...,"This album was my introduction to Liz Phair (I was in kindergarden when 'Exile In Guyville' was released, okay?) and at the time I bought it, I thought it was pretty good. I guess it's because I didn't have any of her other albums to compare it by. It interested me enough to make me go out and buy 'whitechocolatespaceegg' with which I was only mildly impressed with. When I got my hands on 'Whip-Smart' however, I was blown away. I loved 'Whip-Smart' and thought that this CD was pretty weak in comparison. I admit, it's catchy at times but here's the thing: I like her older stuff better because it's different. It stands out. Her song arrangements and her way with lyrics were so much different from the mainstream. It was really refreshing. Now she sounds like everybody else. It's kind of a shame, really."
1,Whip-Smarm,"It is great for an artist to evolve and to branch out. It is a welcome thing to see them attempt new styles and embrace new influences. However, it is not ok when they lose all their dignity, sense of humor, integrity and common sense.Sorry, Liz. It is indeed better by far to get paid, but to churn out dull, contrived, manufactured, bandwagon pop is a slap-in-the-face to the fans and to oneself as an artist."
2,another assembly line model.....,"reminds me of the same camp Sheryl Crow attends. I'm sure sheeven gave Liz some tips. You both have to live with yourselvesnow. Grow up and play and record to people who made you in the first place?Like Sheryl Crow you have a great voice, and talent, listento your own head and not your record label exe's"
1,Only thing extraordinary is the body,"Just a news flash, theres nothing extraordinary about you. Your songs are bland and predictable. You wouldn't sell records if you werent so searing hot. But thanks for making me listen to your crappy song 50 times a day in the office!"
4,The Matrix Revelations,"Wow,what a concept.Let's take an indie goddess and make her part of the hit-making machine. We'll remove the bad arrangements and tuneless vocals and replace it with the sheen of Avril Lavigne. But we'll actually let Liz write some of the words.Of course we'll leave some of the vocals off key just to prove it's her.If only we could've gotten Avril to sing H.W.C.,now that would've been something."
1,Anything but....,"I own all of Liz Phair's other albums plus quite a few obscure collaborations, bootlegs, etc. I find this latest album unlistenable. The songwriting here is really not up to her usual standard and the extra production just serves to make me miss the old Liz more. I guess I can't blame her for trying to make a few bucks but, like some years of Saturday Night Live, I don't count this as a ""real"" part of her work. I can only hope that Liz will get a little more exposure and people will go on to explore her other albums (I recommend Exile in Guyville for starters)."
5,wow....,"This is one of the most awsome Cd's ever!! I got this CD as a gift, and I wasnt sure if it was going to be any good, but i was way off! This Cd is so not pop and so anti-avril ish, and its a good CD just to listen whenever. Definitley buy it!"
4,Calm Down...,"Yes, it's not ""Exile In Guyville"" but what will ever be that again? Maybe I'm getting too old, but I find this formulaic pop fun to listen to, and I really don't have a problem with it. The songs are great, and granted some of the lyrics are cringe worthy, but enjoyable. Hell, I even like ""H.W.C.""If you bash this simply because she's selling out, you yourself are selling out."
2,"Departure from her previous works does not mean ""dreadful"".","There have been thousands of reviews written about this album by rock critics way more qualified than I, so I'll just make this simple:* If you're looking for an album that sounds like Phair's first record, ""Exile in Guyville"", you will be disappointed.* If you're an avid Phair fan, you'll be a little confused by her new direction, but this album is worth hearing. (One could argue that it's the next point in the trajectory started by ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"".)* If you love top 40 pop music and have heard 'Why Can't I?' on the radio, you'll probably love this album, or at least most of it.Good news for longtime Phair fans who are a little iffy on this record: buying this disc will unlock the magic electronic key to allow you to download another EP online, which is quite different from this album and well worth hearing."
1,Stunner,"I usually write well thought out reviews of the lastest cd release. But after listening to this cd, my mind has melted and I am asking someone to type this review because I can't. This is a horrible, horrible cd, I still love Liz Phair's early stuff, this release is [bad]. What a waste of my money, I have already given away the cd to a eight year old neighbor who seems to like it when she is not listening to the latest Jewel cd."
2,Where's the Edge?,"A long time fan of Liz Phair, I was ecstatic to see a new album. whitechocolatespaceegg was not my favorite, so I was hoping this would restore my undying love for Liz's music. But it's not our Liz Phair of old! She could join ranks with Britney on this one. I am disappointed in the over-produced feel of the album, the pop-overtones and the seeming disregard for those fans who like her music because it's generally so much different than mainstream. I would suggest listening to some tracks before purchasing this CD - make sure it's Avril you want, not Liz Phair."
5,How Did I Ever Live (and work) Without This Awesome Light?,"I will only take the time to rate a product in order to warn fellow online shoppers about what I perceive to be inferior products (junk) or to spread the word when I find products that exceed my expectations (exceptional value). The eGear Luxeon HL 1-Watt LED Headlamp is the latter. If you're in the market for an incredibly bright, comfortable, and easy to use hands-free light source; give this awesom product serious consideration."
3,Enjoyable,"Net Force was at it again, using their most sophisticated technology available & the cumulative mental & physical skills of the whole team to capture two evasive drug dealers, whose product would transform an average Joe into a Superman. The pharmaceutical company was hunting them down due to the drug's marketability, the Government was doing the same thing too for it poses major security threat to the country should it fall into the wrong hand. A highly enjoyable pulp fiction as long as we don't take it seriously, & enough twists to keep us guessing till the very end."
5,exciting,I don't usually read mystery books but this one caught my eye. Really makes you think about the future. What an unusual hobby for Toni to try...scrimshaw ? Had to try the web adress to see if it was real...and what a surprise !! it IS !!
5,This CD is the best,This CD is awesome. It's hard and very good. It is the best I have listened to along with Limp Bizkit and Korn. I suggest this CD to anyone who likes hard-alternative music. They are the best.
3,............,"Ok, I own 3 deftones cd, Around the Fur, The White Pony, and Deftones (Self-Titled). My own summer (shove it) has to be the greatest Deftones song ever. Then there is Headup, wow, awesome. And then there is the rest of the cd......... Not creative, their creative juices weren't really working for them there. There is no depth to the songs, really good heavy metal wise, but i know local bands who write better stuff. Deftones (Seft-Titled), and the white Pony is really were I became a Huge Deftones Fan. The album really hasn't grown on me, and there aren't enuff songs on the cd, aka not enuff variety. I was going to give this cd a 2, but because they have really grown to make better music I gave this cd a 3"
5,Classic!,"A classic, nuff said. Every song is amazingly written, you never get sick of it, at least I don't. It's tough to pinpoint any certain good moments because the record is awesome pretty much the whole way through. But the long outro on Be Quiet and Drive is probably one of the most climactic musical moments ever, you can just feel it building up in your chest every time. Dai the Flu is my favorite however. Anyways, if you don't have this, you need to. I think it's the Deftones best."
4,Sweet sweet screaming in my ears,"This has gotta be the hardest, sweatiest CD I have had the pleasue of listening to. While their debut CD, Adrenaline, was a showcase for the metal talent Chino and the boys had, thisCD shows that they can more than hold their own in terms of musicality as well. And while the first one was a never-ending purge of anger, this one broadens its scope in terms of lyrical content, even attempting the occasional love song (Mascara, Be Quiet and Drive). The results are quite surprising. Look for the same thing to happen on White Pony, their follow up (somebody tell me when this is supposed to come out! ). Many songs are still very abrasive and furious, such as Lotion and the title track, but these pale in comparison to their real songs, Be Quiet and Drive, Dai the Flu, and MX most notably. Don't forget to listen to the hidden track, Damone!"
5,DEFTONES ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!,"DEFTONES ARE THE BEST BAND RIGHT ABOVE KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT. THE MUSIC AND LYRICS ROCK IN EVERY SONG!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD, YOU SHOULD!! ANY OF YOU WHO DON'T LIKE THE DEFTONES, DON'T READ ANYMORE REVIEWS BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE LIKES IT!!!!"
4,Handy and accurate,I bought this book for a vacation to the Smokys. I used it to pick the trails best suited for my ability's. I found it to be very accurate on its trail ratings and descriptions. A must have for improving the quality of your hikes.
4,A Painter Passing Through--Beautiful artwork,"Gordon Lightfoot added another chapter to his long recording career with the release of ""A Painter Passing Through"" this May. With a baritone voice that is perfectly suited for the album's rustic imagery, and his longtime band playing on all the basic tracks, this work represents one of Lightfoot's best efforts. The new release includes 10 songs which show off the artist's versatility. From the bluesy Boathouse, to the country flavor of ""I Used to be a Country Singer"" and ""Red Velvet"" to the classic, acoustic Lightfoot sound from the title track, this delightful album offers something for everybody.Lightfoot purists should love the autobiographical nature of ""Drifters"" and ""Much to My Surprise."" The title track, outstanding in lyric and sound, is a poignant reminiscence of his life as he recalls his ""walk of fame"" during his heyday of the 1970s. Whether you are a casual listener or a longtime loyal fan, ""A Painter Passing Through"" is likely to please you."
1,I want my money back!,"I am a hard-core fan of Gord. But this cd is terrible! It was the only time I've ever written to a music company asking for my money back (of course it was ignored). Then I tried giving it away to my father-in-law, who is also a big fan. Last I saw, it was being used to balance out an uneven chair leg."
5,Excellent!,"If anyone wants to know why the Council Fathers enacted the reforms that they did, this is the book for you. I strongly reccomend that every minister involved in Catholic liturgy carefully read this book so they may have a deeper appreciation for the reforms Vatican II instituted."
3,Cool Case,Nice case but I've had it for about a month and the case stopped un-buttoning from the belt clip.
5,BODY LANGUAGE,"I LOVE IT!! BUT THEN AGAIN, I LOVE ALL HIS CD'S, HE IS THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES! HAVE SEEN HIM SEVERAL TIMES IN CONCERT, AND IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM, DO IT !! IT WILL BE WELL WORTH THE $$$"
1,Not up to Boney James standard,"I'm a big fan of Boney's. I started with Body Language, went with Shake It Up, and stumbled on a used copy of Trust. Those are 3 incredible CDs, especially Trust. But Sweet Thing is a disappointment: there is one really good track, the rest have vocals and don't sound like Boney at all. At least, the vocals don't let Boney come thru. I love the way he has the guts to really slow down, to dare you to be that cool. But Sweet Thing is off on a tangent."
3,THE CAT WHO TALKED TO GHOSTS,Ordered for my Mother & she has not read yet. I found it cute but not my type book. Will not order thisauthor again.
4,Pretty Good,"This was my first ""Cat Who"" novel.The book was well done.It was full of suspence, Mystery,and history.The characters were well drawn.It even scared me a little.The book just didnt have an unexpected ending like Agatha Christie,but I still recomend this book."
1,Poor service,Initially I was pleased with how quickly my book arrived. Upon further review I realized that the wrong edition had been sent.
5,I love this book!,"This book is a ""must-have"" for administrators! It is easy to read and includes all the information you need to know to be well-informed about current legal issues. I also ordered the Pocket Guide to take to school so I have one available for quick reference.G. Buermann, Middle School Principal"
4,Fabulous Military Science Fiction,"I thought this book to be very well written. Both the plot and characters are well developed. I particularly like Rosenburg's attention to detail in making his characters REAL to the reader. This allows us to become more fully engrossed in the story and ensures a more enjoyable read.The idea of a mercenary world is not new, however, Rosenburg tops all others that I have read. Read this book, then read it again"
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"Ok well this is one dvd that everyone should have. Scary Movie is, without a doubt, the funniest DVD of the year. It combines humor from many movies and mixes them together. There was only one scene which i did not find that funny and that was when Buffy (shannon Elizibeth) dies. Its kind of stupid how they killed her but o well. It has some great cut scenes that are funny, especially the clip with shorty and his ""movie"". If you have seen the cut scenes you know what im talking about. overall a great movie. My second favorite dvd behind GLADIATOR."
2,A steaming hot pile of crap,"This film is largely unsuccessful, even as a parody. I will admit, there were some moderately shocking parts (like the breast implant scene and the semen scene), which were sometimes funny, and the brief parody of The Usual Suspects was well-done, but these were few and far between. None of the characters grabbed me in any way, particularly ""Doofy"" - who seems to have walked right off of the bar napkin of some drunken writer. I might give this 3 stars if I was 11. For a 90-minute movie, it was 80 minutes too long. At least rent it before you buy it."
4,The Wayons At It Again!,"Coming into the theatre to watch Scary Movie, I thought this was going to be yet another Leslie Nielsen somewhat funny type spoof (i.e. Spy Hard & Wrongfully Accused) BOY WAS I WRONG! From all of the comedies I've seen this year so far, Scary Movie ranks high along with Jim Carrey in Me, Myself & Irene as the funniest in my opinion. From the opening sequence to the very THRILLING, yet funny finally, Scary Movie delivers your $9.00 worth of entertainment. If you liked ""Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood' or Fox's In Living Color, then you'll love this new movie brought to you by the talented Wayans Bros."
2,"Ultimately Disgusting, and only Occasionaly Humerous","This film was a definately different twist to the gross out comedy genre. I will give the film that, it is different, but comedies like these lack substance and are ultimately pointless. Scary Movie was sick, and not entirely funny. The script, the idea, and the concept were not worth putting on film. It may have raked in some cash, but if the movie industry is not going to care about film quality and greatness, and only about money and box office revenue, the film industry may has well stop making movies all together. Do not see this movie if you like films that are serious and potentially could be a classic. I would reccomend this mmovie for any fan of gross out humor. Trust me there is plenty of it in this film."
2,"Why Spoof Horror, Any Way?","Why spoof a horror movie, any way? Those teen-scream flicks I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... and SCREAM (plus sequels) practically spoof themselves. What can be added by making this flick?Alright, so SCARY MOVIE was funny in some places. And I can appreciate some vulgar humor in the SOUTH PARK vein. But unlike SOUTH PARK, SCARY MOVIE doesn't come off with the same success. SOUTH PARK tries continually to outdo itself, but it pulls it off with a certain level of ""class"".SCARY MOVIE ultimately fails because it tries to hard. Hence resorting to flashing the male anatomy several times for a chuckle. Please! If you want to do toilet humor, fine, but at least make it funny... something more like Mike Myers drinking ""poo"" in AUSTIN POWERS, as he says ""It's nutty!"" and grins.Shawn Wayans fans will enjoy his performance. It's great stuff, there's just not enough of it. I wouldn't feel bad if you fast-forwarded through the rest."
4,INVENTIVE AND FUNNY,"I really liked this movie. The humour is black and extreme with some really funny scenes. The pace is quick with no slack or bad bits. It cruises along effortlessly with good performances, scripting and acting. It reminds me of just how ridiculous and formularised these horror movies really are. Some of the jokes are really bad taste ( think Me , Myself and Irene) so if you like that sort of stuff this ones for you. It takes a swipe at almost every stereotype, the virgin, the jock, the homosexual, the cheerleader and the ejaculation scene is unexpectadly wild ( as is the dick in the ear scene). Laugh yourself silly."
3,Who let the crap out?,This movie is funny in some bits but not in others it crap and full of sex that doesn't need to be in there
1,Terrible movie,This movie was funny the first time you watch it. But after that don't waste your time. This movie has no replay value and to me that makes this a pretty damn bad movie.
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"Although this movie is worth a few laughs for ADULTS, it is basically a glorified porno flick and should not be shown to young children. This would seem to be obvious, but in the movie theater I went to see this sub-standard film, there were quite a few idiots there with their young kids (at an R-rated movie? Couldn't you find a sitter?) and the kids seemed confused and disturbed much of the time. Yes, I laughed a couple of times at this movie, but it was not easy with little girls watching the same thing. If you have a young child, especially a little girl, and let them watch this film with four ... scenes and an adult ..., you are a disgusting piece of trash who should be thrown in jail for child abuse. That was my experience with watching this film in a ""family"" theater."
2,"Not so good, but not as offensively bad as some think.","As you can see, this film elicits very extreme reactions: people either hurt themselves laughing or were appalled. I'm in the middle. I have no problem with the raunchiness of the humor (I mean, it can't hold a candle to early John Waters films which I find hysterical). It's just that most of it wasn't all that funny. Granted, there were some big laughs for me, but they were throw-away gags, not big comedy set pieces. But, you've gotta admire any film which portrays David Arquette as the bonehead he is. I just wish it were funnier, though it WAS watchable and good-natured (all the actors are game and lively, which helped a lot). If only Keenan Ivory Wayans had been responsible for the script and not his absolutely no-talent brothers Shawn and Marlon, we might've gotten a five star comedy."
1,Disappointing,"Maybe I'm having a conservative reaction to this film but it wasn't exactly the funiest movie. If you have seen the previews to this movie, you have seen all the good parts. Its not worth seeing the rest. They could have done a much better job if they stuck to making fun of Scream, Matrix and all of that. The sexual humor was just simply discusting. Maybe my problem was that it was male nudity."
1,Garbage Movie,"This movie is simply a movie of stupid humor. I must admit that I enjoyed the Naked Gun movies, but this movie takes that premise and makes it ridiculous. The Wayans brothers seem to produce stupid comedy, as their hosting of the MTV music awards was a disaster. In closing, Scary Movie attempts to be funny by relaying scenes of ridiculous actions, such as a girl being shot to the ceiling by an orgasm. Some of the scenes may be original, but anyone off the street could think up trash like this."
2,"They Shoulda Called It ""Stupid Movie""","Oh, man, were the Wayans brothers way off the mark with this one. Slapping together parodies of ""Scream"" and the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" flicks, and even the whole ""Whazzup"" catch-phrase, I guess they thought it would make for humorous cinematic fodder. The bits were tired, perhaps because they were so lame in the original movies, and the whole deflowering of the Cindy character was handled in such a tasteless, unfunny manner. The one good thing about this whole waste of celluloid was that the Carmen Electra character got killed off way before she had a chance to annoy us with any further character development. Oh, yeah, she totally had to be in her underwear when she got slammed upside the head with a car windshield. I guess that was pretty funny. Save your money. Go in a different direction. Far away from this one."
1,Scary Movie,I can't see the movie on DVD. Same problem as others have had. It starts with the FBE warning and stays there. You can't get past it. Only way out is to eject the DVD unseen. Stupid. I've tried 4 copies from Blockbuster and Hollywood Video with same results. I even tried it on my computer DVD and it hangs up.Somethings wrong here.I going to return the DVD and get the VHS.
1,Tacky poor parody,"I was very disappointed in this movie. There were only two funny parts and both appeared on the TV teasers for the movie (facial expression of the scream monster). This is a very poor parody of scream, with a little blair witch and exorcist thrown in. My simplest analogy would be an extremely tacky Mel Brooks type of film, but without the humor or the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like tacky, I like tasteless, and I think Mel Brooks and the Airplane/Naked Gun series are all great - but a movie has to have some humor about it. This one didn't."
1,Don't waste your time...,"The trailers made the move look absolutely hilarious for one reason: they showed ALL or darn near all of the funny scenes. During the entire movie, you expect and wait for them and there is no comical pay-off; You have already seen them and know the outcome. In between the known gags are terrible, terrible ones. They do produce a laugh just because of their utter stupidity and gross-out factor. Bottom line: Haven't seen the trailer? Rent the film. Seen the trailer? You've seen the movie."
5,I still love this movie,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I loved it. And since I want to see the second one I rented this one to see it again. and it is still as good as I remember it to be, and I still rememberd half the movie. I say this is a must see movie."
3,"Pretty Good, In Fact","Thinking about it, it is not really ambitious making a parody on Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, since these are parodies on themselves. And maybe that's why Scary Movie somehow does seem to work out.The recipe is the same: Some gorgeous chicks and a lot of (in this case overimposed) geeks'n'psychos. Nobody, least of all the viewer, knows who does what and why, and in fact, it doesn't really matter.A lot of this crazy humour works pretty well. Only... there's too much stupid humour about sex... and as usual, you don't SEE anything!"
5,Good for those with a sense of humor,"It was a great spoof movie. I was cracking up all the way through. Much much better than ""Not Another Teen Movie"". If you don't like spoofs,vulgarity, drug references and the like, then you won't like this."
5,Funny from beginning to end.,"This was very close to be the funniest movie ever made.Every part of this movie was wonderfully written.The killer was very funny,and the Matrix spoof was hilarious.This was a very good movie,but not as good as Scary Movie 2."
1,I didn't like this movie at all,"I can sit through most movies I rent and even if I don't really care for them, I still think of them as ok. But I really didn't like this movie at all. I wanted to stop watching it about 1/4 of the way through. The only reason I didn't stop watching it was because from the previews it looked like something I would really like. I thought it was tasteless, disgusting and plain old stupid. Maybe some people like this type of movie, but I definitely don't. It's not often that I get fooled by previews of a movie. This time I did. I had to give it one star because that was the minimum. I would give it zero if I could."
4,very good,one of the most hillarious movise i've seen in a long time this movie has lots of explicit humor. the reason why i find this movie funny is because i like it how they make fun of scary movies. there was only one thing i found really gross and felt like puking but lets not go there and any way great movie worth watch ing and buying horror:4 violence:6 gore:6 humor:9+
3,Semi Funny,"Scary Movie, definitely cleaner than its sequel, has its funny parts and its idiotic parts...The first 15 to 20 minutes is hilarious, but the rest of the film just has bits and pieces that are funny. Little of the raunchiness is funny, but you kind of have to laugh for its failed attempt...Scary Movie rates 3 out of 5 for its effort and its 15 minutes of fame...otherwise this film is poor..."
1,Ugh!...,"Okay, maybe there were some funny parts. But that still doesn'tmake up for the two hours of complete stupidity and crude humor that filled this movie. There were maybe about two minutes of good jokes about every thirty minutes, and that doesn't nearly make up for even ten minutes of that completely awful movie. It's the basic plot to the Scream trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer, filled with toilet humor. I walked out of the move half-way through ... If someone happens to tape it for you off of the TV in about eight months, I don't even suggest watching it then. It was a complete waste of money and if you're looking for a good comedy you should go somewhere else."
1,Nothing but trouble..........,"This camera has been nothing but trouble, I will never buy another Cannon Camera again. It started with the dreaded E18 error where the camera just won't turn on and now its a lens that opens when it feels like it. This camera is so unreliable. I hate it."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"My mom recently recieved this camera as a gift, well to say the least the picture quality is so poor. They usually all come out blurry or disfigured. I would not recommend this camera."
3,Problems with the wide angle lens attachment,"The Cannon A75 is a great little camera, but the zoom lens at its widest is about equivalent to a normal 55mm lens on a 35mm camera. If you're planning on using the wide angle lens attachment you may be in for a disappointment: The add-on lens blocks part of the optical viewfinder, so you have to rely on the lcd screen. The screen is fixed and sometimes impossible to see in bright light. On the other hand, when using the lens attachment in low-light situations you'll find that the lens blocks the built-in flash. If you need a digital camera with wide angle capabilities, this is not the one for you."
1,Waste of a warrante,Almost exactly a year after I bought this camera the LCD screen broke and Canon refused to cover the warranty. The cost is almost $150 to get it fixed. I didn't drop the camera but it had scratches due to normal use. Heaven forbid you spend $400 on a camera (including additional memory and extended warranty) Canon give you a case to carry the camera in so it won't get scratches on it. This is probably so they can use the excuse not to cover the warranty. I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone. It's not nearly as durable and easy to use as Canon claims.
1,"It's broken again, even after being repaired","We initially thought it was a pretty good camera. However, it fell from 18 inches to the ground and shattered. We spent $100 to repair it through Cannon. Six months later, it's got the same problems that were supposed to have been repaired. In fact, on the last trip, it actually started smoking! I'm not kidding. Now, it won't focus at all and Canon says the repairs were only good for 60 days. After this experience, I cannot recommend Canon or this camera."
4,Nice Camera,"handy, nice picture quality but batteries don't last long...I would suggest rechargeable batteries with it"
1,Canon PowerShot A75 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3X Optical Zoom,the canon powershot a75 3.2mo digital camera with 3x optical zoom is not working the rigth way it will not stay on more than 30 seconds can't take pictures i am not happy with this camera at all no matter with batter's i put in the camera it will do the same thing so i am dealing with a camera that is not working the rigth way.
1,E18 Error - Do not buy!!,"I have a Powershot A70 that stopped working within a year because of the E18 error. Because it arrived at the Factory Service Center just after 1yr, the repair was not covered by warranty. The charge is ~$115 for repair but the repair work only has a 3month warranty. This is obviously a design flaw which has been carried over to the A75 and several other models. Search the internet and you'll find out how common it is. Instead of fixing the problem, they are using it as an opportunity to make even more money off their customers. DO NOT BUY A CANON CAMERA WITH E18 PROBLEMS!"
5,"Loved this, it was a hard to find item.","Love this, saw the movie a few years back, wanted to watch it this past Christmas,none of the networks or Netflix showed the movie. Was glad to find it at Amazon."
3,The Christmas Spirit,"If you're like me, you're one of those year 'round Christmas people. Our planning starts right after Labor Day! This movie, like many made-for-tv Christmas comedies isn't meant to be deep or profound; it's simply a funny and enjoyable story about what Christmas should truly mean in this crazy materialistic world. Love, family and an appreciation for what really matters is explained in a way that isn't condescending. You'll laugh at the silly jokes and want to watch it again."
1,A Little Too Close To Another Band For Me,"I am from the Mid-West, and there is a band here that has the same exact sound and most of the same lyrics to their songs, they are called the ""Persistant Ducks"" the name of their CD was ""Addicted To Quack"" I personally know that the Ducks have been around since 1996 and have been singing te songs since them. They just sound really close to me and I can smell a copycat, even with that it is a really good sound and great songs, they just cannot capture the energy of the Ducks."
2,"Interesting, but...","...extremely poorly written.The author has little talent beyond paraphrasing previously-published reports and official documentation.Indeed, he did so little actual editing of his own work that the entire volume is filled with repetitions.I was extremely disappointed and I do not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Cassette Book on Tape,Would have liked to know if all tapes worked...three of the tapes needed to be repaired before using...but all is fine now. Unfortunately this book never made it to CD.
4,sub fan must have,"This book is an excellent source of WWII American submarine's greatest hero and many behind the scenes look at how the submarine force waged it's battles. Author divulges some little known facts on how poorly the admirals ran the silent service initially, until a few captains changed their minds. A little frustraing to read in that O'Kanes exploits are interspersed with other anecdotes regarding the navy and it's issues. Hard to follow the book's hero's journey, when author continually jumps around. All round a good source for sub fans though."
5,Awesome and inspirational story!,"God will place you in the most amazing situations and this book is proof that God will take you out of your comfort zone. Awesome story of Love, giving and more.. It shows the true meaning of ""Love your neighbor as yourself."""
5,Definitely Recommended!,"Now that the swing revival seems to be over, Royal Crown Revue seems to be the only group left standing. And for good reason. This band is great, and this being the album that introduced me to them, I think it's great, too. The Contender and Walk on Fire are also solid investments. Great band, great CD."
3,Does what it's suppose to do,"Just from looking at it the quality is not good (cheap plastic), but it does the job. Not sure how long it will last though since it doesn't seem very durable."
5,One of the funniest movie,"i believe Indian Cinema has never had another Director as brilliant as Priyadarshan to make u go nuts......The Comedy in his movies never stops....one funny bone after another the story keeps hitting all the parts of our body that can laugh....And Secondly,Indian cinema has found its own pair of Comedy Geniuses...Paresh Rawal and Om Puri....the new Rawal-n-Puri duo has given such a commendable comic performance that i believe will give any comedian in World Cinema a run for his money....the pure Innocence of the Village-People of India is portrayed beyond perfection by the Duo...And,at last but not the least....Kudos to all the Cast of this rib-tickling comic havoc....Keep up the brilliance people...heres awaiting more...still a good Timepass. Do watch!!"
4,This is the best chinese medicine book for laypeople...,that I know of but as always please let me know if you know something better.The best spirit of chinese medicine will all help us break free from the bad habits we picked up in western medicine (too numberous to enumerate here)and return to the truer roots of a truly healthy and spiritual life.Ephraim Jeffrey Geltman
2,Still a Mystery to Me,"For the last several years I ended the winter with coughing fits and lung congestion, for which I sought and received the usual western remedies, which proved somewhat useful. But the congestion usually remains, with my coughing and hacking provoking my wife to nag me into seeing her herbalist/acupuncture practitioner, who invariably succeeded where my western medicine had failed. I finally asked the herbalist/L.Ac. to recommend something which explained the workings of Oriental Medicine, and he recommended this book. Although I'm now familiar with concepts such as qi, yin and yang, I find that, even armed with this book, I'm still mystified, and find I still must uncomfortably rely on simple belief that my L.Ac. knows what he's doing, since the logic of these treatment protocols still eludes me."
4,For those studying for the California State Board...,"This is a classic book for acupuncture in the U.S. In many places, it uses specific different terminology from other books. The appendixes contain a large amount of info on diagnosis and pattern differentiation. I had to pull out the patterns with unfamiliar names like ""heat poison in the Liver and Gallbladder"" to make sure I wasn't stumped on the test. Apart from the appendixes, however, the rest of the info is covered in other books or is too philosophical or speculative to be tested.It's not a bad first book for those new to chinese medicine, but it assumes you want to know a lot... and you may not!"
3,Good Ideas if You Want to Warm Over Someone Else's,"I returned this book. It is possible that I rated this book a tad low because it didn't fit the artistic place I occupied by the time it arrived. The author should not be penalized for that; decide for yourself if Kiteley is a good writing coach for you. I have several other books of idea prompts, and I also journal. In the final analysis, if a person can't think of anything to write about, writing may not be the optimum medium of self-expression for him or her."
4,good,"the Product was new and shipment was quick, the only problem was the disk was loose in the case and the middle insert to hold the disc in place was broken."
1,The League Of Extraodinary Crap,This movie was so stupid.The only good thing about this movie was Stuart Townsend but even he couldn't save this movie from getting more than one star from me.What were they thinking when they released this pile of trash?!
3,charming,"There's a classic comic book feel of this movie that makes it enjoyable, but also makes it an easy target for the snide. Oh well. You can tell from various descriptions if this will appeal to you. I give it three stars."
3,good fun,i liked this flick. it's cornball but that doesnt mean its not enjoyable. reminded me a lot of movies i enjoyed as a kid.
2,They used the title but forgot to use the story!,"This is just a butchery of H.G.Wells' classic story. There seem to be two extra characyers in it, too. I wonder why! They jusy HAD to make surethere was at least ONE American in the movie, because, shallow as it may seem, a movie without an American will not sell in the US! It's as simple and as shallow as that.I quickly grew tired of the turgid literary references that would almost certainly be wasted anyway on the sort of audience this film is designed to enthrall -""Call me Ishmael"", for instance.It is a watchable movie, all the same, but if you have any love for literature I suggest you stay away from this, as you will almost certainly be enraged by this film."
2,Pretty Bad,"If you loved ""Doc Savage - Man of Bronze"" you'll love ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" 'nuff said."
2,Fake... very fake...,"Perhaps I would appreciate this movie more if I had read the comic beforehand ... I didn't, I read reviews of this movie instead. I came in without expecting much, and in return I didn't receive much. All of the special effects in this film seemed to scream ""fake."" The storyline did not excite me one bit... I kept thinking to myself ""is it over yet?""I will say this, for such a pitiful role, Sean Connery did add a bit of redeeming quality to the film."
4,fun movie,"Want a life changing event? Climb a mountain in Tibet. Want something fun to watch for a few hours? Try a movie. I did and I had a good time viewing League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It lived up to my expectations and entertained me. More of a showcase for the heroes and villains than anything else but you can't beat the characters in this, and the casting, for a fun time."
1,"Sad, just sad",This movie was one of the worst I have seen in along time. The story line was absolutely terrible. This movie made no sense what so ever. It was a pathetic attempt to match up to the rest of the super hero movies out there and felled miserably.
1,Absolute Bollocks,"The worlds largest sea bearing vessel (by atleast a thousand times) floating through the canals of Venice, F@%K OFF. What a waste of talent, this movie thoroughly blows goats."
2,Ugh. Just awful.,"First off, I adore the comic. The characters are each well thought out and you really do learn to care in a certain way about each one. The movie, however, was awful. It was obviously made for a quick buck, focusing on the action part of the movie, they made the villain absolutely ridiculous, and because the Great 'I'm so awesome and need to play the male role' Sean Connery funded the movie, he was made into the leader of the team, and in a disgrace to Mina, she was thrust into the stereotypical female of the group that every other male needs to be attracted to. The effects were awful, and nevermind breaking every rule of common logic of the Venice scene(I won't spoil). Don't waste your time on this movie, it's just not worth losing time that could be done doing something more productive."
2,Eye candy only.,"Not a bad picture; however it's not a great one either. Nothing but eye candy and some decent action sequences. Unfortuately, the plot has some blaring holes and the action is shot way to close to see what's going on. Naseeruddin Shah is great as Nemo, Peta Wilson is hot as Mina Harker and Jason Flemyng is touching as Dr. Jekyll. This movie is for visual lovers only."
4,An extra star for effects ...,"I would have put this at a 3 but the effects were amazing enough for another star. I enjoyed the movie and found the characters riviting BUT the ending was missing something. I cannot really put my finger on it but I was left with a puzzled look on my face. I think the most intriguing character is Jekyll and Hyde. Overall, it was not a disappointing buy, but I don't see it as one I would watch over and over again."
5,League of EX Gentlemen,"I know the title of my review may sound a little odd, but for the record, the offical title is 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. I just used EX Gentlemen just to save myself from typing out extraordinary. Anyway, I saw this movie in the theatres and enjoyed it. I used to have another form of this dvd, but I lost it somehow, so when it came up here on amazon, I decided to go after it again. Anyway, if you like action and are familar with Sean Connery, you should enjoy this since it gets active right at the start."
2,Uninspired Crap,"Alan Moore is a genius, but this film doesn't capture that - instead it captures all the childish flaws of the comics story-process and magnifies them until they're unforgiveable.First, the enchanting feminine allure of Peta Wilson is thown away when she rips into a guy's neck and gets splashed with his severed artery. So there's no sexual tension at all - she's just a monster in the shape of a woman.There's something about using the buildings of Venice as dominoes.. Something unbelievable.. Or is it just ridiculous?Then there's Connery, who is not a deep enough thinker to make gold out of this wooden, paint-by-numbers script. He was phoning it in. I don't blame him - what else could he do?This was to be a summer-weekend blockbuster but it sank without a trace last August - and deservedly so. The plot is a pile of rickety Rube-Roldberg tricks and there's just nothing here to sustain interest - it's dead on arrival. Stay Away."
2,Fun if your standards are low enough,"It's a pity that yet again the movie industry decided to not risk confusing us. They took a very intriguing premise and turned it into a glitzy piece of fluff. But it is very pretty fluff, not brilliant but pretty.As long as you don't try to think about the movie and just go with the ride, it is enjoyable. Any thought, and the movie just falls apart. (For instance, consider the time this movie is taking place - early 1900's, I think - and the fact that Tom Sawyer was a teenager before the Civil War of the 1860's based on the book by Mark Twain, and that Mina and Jonathan Harker were young adults when Dracula came to London in 1894 or 1895 based on the original novel of Dracula by Bram Stoker.)"
2,What a disaster.,"I was looking forward to seeing this, but I was highly disappointed when I finally had the chance to do so. This movie has a messy plot that I wasn't even into. I was thinking that maybe as the movie went on, I would be more interested, but I wasn't. Stuart Townsend couldn't even save this movie. His part wasn't big enough. (he's too good to be in this movie) Boring production, drab colors, nothing to hold one's mind at all. This is going in the back of my collection and probably never coming out. Avoid this at all costs."
2,The league of extraordinarily quick and muddled productions.,"I rented this flick with the expectations that all the negative press and word of mouth was a little exagerated due to the engaging premise. Come to find out the negative press and word of mouth was dead on, this flick is a letdown. It seems this movie was rushed due to the gaping plot holes, average fx, and blindingly quick action scenes (so much is happening all at once you can barely tell WHAT is going on). Given maybe better direction and a lengthier script and production, this could've been a really neat franchise. Another in the long list of 'no brainer' adaptations (comic book or otherwise) that if the filmmakers had stuck closer to the source material, should've had a fun and entertaining blockbuster. When will Hollywood producers realize that if they meld great fx with an exciting, smart script and make a good movie they will make a lot more coin than they will with the likes of THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN? puzzling."
1,What were they thinking???,"This is an awful movie. I love Sean Connery but he had no business being in this movie! I wish I could get my money back! I would give this a ""0"" rating if one existed!"
4,pure popcorn escapism,"i've read the reviews saying that lxg is ""too slow"" and ""too fast"" and ""too confusing"" and ""too simplistic"" but no matter how much some may hate it i find lxg to be a groovy good popcorn movie that hits the spot when you are in the mood for pure escapism. mark anderson said it all in his review of lxg on this site: if there ever was a movie made for filling up the cracks in the sofa with jiffy pop it is lxg. that's just how i feel about it too."
1,One Of The Worst Films Ever Made,"This film is so abysmal that words defy explanation. Alan Moore is the greatest creative mind to ever grace the comic industry and unfortunately for him, with the exception of CONSTANTINE, none of his creations have survived the adaptation to the big screen with any dignity or grace. This is by FAR the least of them. THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN (the series) is designed with class, intelligence, and style; all of which the film is completely bereft of. Those of you who have not seen this film, I beg you, do not waste any precious time or money. For those of you who have not read the comic, please search for that here at Amazon.com, and buy it. You will be extraordinarily pleased. Forget the movie."
4,A little Hackney but cute,"Yes, this movie is soeme what uneven, a bit far fetched (The Captain's car, sub, and escape pod) and sometimes a bit silly ( Zane Grey Chaacter and the Vampiress Love/hate relationship, it was still cute and very funny. Sean Connery presence adds a certain class and all the actors except the young guy playing the Pinkerton agent do a great job."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"The leaguye of extraordinary men may like a fantastic super-powered action punched film...but dont let the trailer fool ya.The L.E.G is a movie that requires alot of attention and u feel like your in a classroom learning. Yes the trailer showed cool scenes... But when you watch the movies all those cool scenes go by extrememly fast every single action (no exageration) zooms by so fast you don't know what happens. The story plot is good but once again there are too many things to follow and you get confused and start asking questions like...""wait what happened?, who's that?, what is he doing?"" This is not a good film at all it is not worth renting or buying. Please don't waste your money! For this I give one star."
3,decent action,"there was some decent action. the sets also looked pretty good. the dialog was really stupid. connery's character said that the american way was to shoot a lot of bullits without aiming, but with five round clips if you were lucky, firing indescriminantly wasn't an option in the beggining of the 19 hundreds. and he forgot that sharpshooters were a big reason that america kicked his country's a$$ and became a country."
2,"Stuipid Plot, Stuipid Movie","When I first heard of the idea of this movie I was intrigued and thought that any director who would try and tackle such a complex plot would know what he was doing. Apparently, I was worng. It seems as if the characters are thrown together in some chaos that is a confusing as it is irritating. Looking at the idea of the movie though I am not sure that anyone could have done much better. The idea is still original so I recommend a that you watch it, but don't waste your money on buying it. It isn't a movie that you will want to watch again."
1,dont waste your money!,"LoEG (the movie) has about as much in common with LoEG the serialized graphic novel as ""Shakespeare in Love"" (again, the movie) had to the real life of Shakespeare the playwright. It is merely an interpretation rathern than an addaptation, and it is a poor one at that.If you want to know what the adventures of these victorian supermen (and superwoman) *please* get the graphic novel (now compiled in volumes 1 and 2)."
1,Incompetent,"One of the most interesting and innovative comic books in the last twenty years reduced to a television level script and acting/directing that will be prime fodder for some future incarnation of Mystery Science Theatre. Has to be seen to understand how really awful it is. It's yet another example of Hollywood buying a popular property, then ditching everything that made it a success in the first place."
3,"not the worst movie ever, but not the best","The positive reviews on here are right, but so are the negative reviews. This movie is all over the map. Some of it is great, but a lot of it is sooo hokey. Take a good look at all the reviews on here and you'll get a pretty good idea of what a crazy movie LXG is. It's like a b*stard child of X Men and Plan 9 From Outer Space. This movie thrilled me when it worked, but when it was off-the-wall I smiled and laughed so hard it hurt. I enjoyed the ride, but you may not."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Being a HUGE fan of Sean Connery, I have been looking forward to this movie for months. I could not have been more disappointed. I thought the acting was great but the movie and the plot [bad]. For example the bad guy was trying to get the world to go to war but it never explained why. What was his reason? There was also a lot of jumping from scene to scene and not explaining where they were or why they were there. Mr. Hyde was another HUGE disappointment. It was just as bad as the hulk. There was very little character development; I never grew attached to any of the characters. They also left some things open ended. The movie was over and you go ""wait a minute. What happened to that guy?"" Or ""What was going on here?"" Very poorly done and it is a shame to waste any money to go see it."
4,worth your time to watch,"Great plot, amazing action scenes, totally cool modes of transportation and decent acting! I enjoyed this movie experience and left the theatre wanting more. My only complaint is that it was too short. Some places in the movie needed more detail and to be played out more. Also, there are some scenes that are difficult to watch because they are so dark, but otherwise a pleasure to watch. Go check it out!"
3,It could have been really good!,"When I first found out about this movie I thought it looked like it would be a really fun movie. I got a little worried when I saw it getting such bad reviews, but I thought that maybe people had to high an expectation, and the movie wasn't all that bad. When I finally went to see the movie, I actually enjoyed it a little, but I would never see it again. It had some great characters and actors, but the plot was so pathetic, they should have just left it out! It had a few small twists, but they were not very well thought out and fairly obvious. If you like action movies, watch this movie, but try and get it at the library. Anyone who likes movies with good plots, do not watch this movie!"
3,"Somewhat inferior orchestra, dreadful acoustics","It was a good idea to record all of Dvorak's 'Slavonic Dances' (both series) with a Slovakian orchestra under a Czech conductor, and taken superficially the resulting CD is a pleasant enough affair. Kosler takes the individual dances at a fair pace (Naxos has completely misprinted the track timings on the back cover, making them look quite a lot longer and slower than they actually are), but he was faced with two problems: one was the somewhat inferior quality of the orchestra (a comparison with Rafael Kubelik's superb 1975 recording for Deutsche Grammophon with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra shows up the difference quite starkly!), the other was the dreadful acoustics in the Bratislava Concert Hall which produce a sharp, echoey sound (noticeable especially when listening via headphones). If you can get the Kubelik, you will find it much more pleasing to the ear."
5,Excellent filtration and aeration,"I have a hexagonal three-gallon tank that is home to my grandson's carnival-won goldfish year after year. I don't have the heart to flush these fish away, probably because I don't have to regularly clean or replace the water.The unit attaches to the inside glass with two suction cups and always stays in place. The filter is excellent for providing the necessary aeration and filtration to keep these fish lively and disease-free, and one cartridge keeps the tank crystal clear for three months. [If you have a smaller tank or bowl with fewer fish, the cartridge will last longer.]Two of our ""carnival fish"" are four years old and still lively.I'm hoping my grandson will stop winning these fish so I can purchase the fish I actually want.With no moving parts, the filter lasts forever and is powered by a small air pump outside the tank and connected to the filter with flexible tubing. The cartridges are easy to replace by just snapping them into the unit."
3,It's Ok,"So I bought this thinking it would be great and it is, kinda. I hooked it up and it sounded like someone was making soup. It bubbles and it's pretty loud. My male betta didn't like the water movement so I just took the carbon and stuff out of it and put it in one of my Tetra filters. The noise made me do it. Ps. If you do but this, rinse the cartridge very well with cold water! other wise it will cloud the tank because of the carbon."
1,"Not happy, not happy at all","I am not happy with this camera for many reasons: first off it has no optical zoom, it takes forever to save a picture, so you can not take a series of pics, it gives alot of red eye even when they option has been chosen for no red eye, the batteries run out quickly even the rechargeable, and about 70% of the time I can't take a picture at all. I called and was told that I had to hold the button down half way to focus, then all the way. Well I try and try and try and try and miss so many good pictures!!! I will never buy anything Canon again."
1,nice camera but didn't last,"i owned this camera for a little over 2 years, hardly used it and it still displays saved photo's but the ccd went out on it and the only pictures it takes now look like scratchy lines, my mom bought hers the same time i did and it has the same issue. so as long as you don't expect this camera to last you should be fine :("
1,don't buy it,"John Gilstrap should be ashamed. First of all, the Utah mountains are named correctly, however, there is no Arapahoe County in Utah, nor a town named Eagle Feather. Any ski resort where it would be necessary to fly over the Wasatch Mountains to get to Salt Lake City would only be about a 30 minute drive and not require a plane.Perhaps Mr. Gilstrap should have put a disclaimer in a blurb at the front of the book saying that the places were fictitious, or perhaps he should have done a bit of research!The characters were shallow, the story was unbelieveable and it was a disappointment. I'd read his previous books, ""Nathan's Run"" and ""At All Costs"", but he lost me as a reader with ""Scott Free."""
1,This will make short list of worsts movies of all time...,"This is the perfect movie to show in a college film/ screenwriting class on how not to make movie. The clichÃ©s, the bad acting, the terrible direction of all its moving parts, and the ill-contrived rushed plot. I stopped this movie a little after the 1-hour mark after it almost made me physical/emotionally ill. Anyone who likes this movie cannot be trusted to even take my trash to the curb. Some movies are bad, but they are made to be corny (i.e ""Transmorphers: Fall of Man"" or any Ed Wood flick) but this has no excuse becuase its supposed to be a serious suspense-drama. The producers and creators of this should seek work doing something else...maybe removing roadkill from the streets.Im not one to suggest ticket sales as a barometer of a good or even quality movie but this one at THE U.S. Box Office took in ticket sales of only $17,164 (stat at IMDB)...they generally find that much in between theater seats for Disney-pixar movies."
1,This a TV movie,This is a typical Lifetime/Oxygen/ Womans Network kind of movie. Very boring.Thank god it has a twist ending or I would have changed channels.
2,Does not cut hair short,"I ordered the identical clipper from hair products but in the blue color. I had to send them back as they did not cut anywhere close to the listing's claims of:""blade adjusts from Size 000 (1/100 inch)"" instead it will cut at a minimum of 1/25 inch and that only on vertical hairs. Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.I decided to send it back since aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff."
2,poor technical quality,"The concert footage is great but the editing is terrible. About half way through the show the sound goes waaaaay out of sync. It is almost like they took decent quality bootleg footage with multiple cameras, and tried to sync the sound from the CD. Its cool for the die hard Iced Earth fan to have the concert footage, but be aware that the production is not very good. Most people should buy the CD instead."
3,Ehh...for die hard fans i suppose,"I am actually a really big iced earth fan and as much as i would like to say this video is awesome, it really isn't. The songs are fantastic! Don't get me wrong, but the camera views and shooting make this concert look like it was taken from a bootleg dvd at a nightclub in some obscure place. Just buy the alive in athens cd and be satisfied..because you won't be with this dvd."
1,Don't Waste Your Eyesight,"Not only does this book win hands-down for the most boring story ever written, but the translation is SO BAD it's not even funny. Where did they get this Jacinthe Leclerc, anyway?? As far as I can tell, she didn't make it past either English OR French 101!! Bottom line, the story reads as pleasantly as a bad rash. Save your money."
3,the Point,"No offense, but I think these readers missed the point. It's not supposed to illustrate a Hollywood-style drama with all kinds of twists and turns. The art, which has a similar pastel tone to Chris Ware, is soothing and slow. ALl too often in a lot of these slow dramatic graphic novels not much happens; however, in this book some interesting things do happen."
2,A neglect of the dark side,"A review of the birth of Turkey without the dark side. Scant or no attention paid to the annihilation of the Armenians (which continued under Ataturk), the widespread massacre of the Greeks of north and western Turkey and the unprecedented oppression of the Kurds.It is like writing a history of the Soviet Union without mentioning the Gulag and the Siberian concentration camps. Or writing a history of the Third Reich without mentioning the holocaust."
3,Outdated,"This book was long considered the classic description of the recent history of Turkey. The author has a beautiful writing style, and the book is a pleasure to read. It is by now fairly outdated, however, and the more recent history of Turkey provides reason to question some of Lewis's assumptions.The book has largely been superseded by Erich Jan Zurcher's ""A Modern History of Turkey"", also available from Amazon, which can be seen as more reliable and covering issues which Lewis neglects. Professor Zurcher, of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, has written an appreciative but nonetheless insightful commentary of the Lewis book. Readers considering purchasing the Lewis book would do well to read this commentary beforehand."
4,a needed update for this book!,"Please write and update for Turkey....the government is now an islamic leaning government which has jailed journalists and military brass!No longer is Turkey looking westward as Ataturk wanted, but Turkey is now looking eastward!Ataturk is slowly being removed from Turkish society whereas the Ottoman Empire is being glorified!Izmir province seems to be the last remaining area of modernity of thought! They celebrated September 9, even though the Ankara government advised against it!Looking forward to reading Mr. Lewis' thoughts on Turkey since September 2001!!!"
1,AUtomatic ignitors constantly fail,"This product is poorly designed. The electronic ignitors on our unit failed 3 times in the first year and had to be replaced. When I called customer support, he admitted they are outsourced and made in China and haven't been reliable. Furthermore, when they were functional, it took a long time for the grill to light, causing combustion and minor explosion. Other problems: tThe heavy duty grill plate cracked twice from the heat.I thought I was getting top of the line product when I purchased the grill. The $300 weber I had was much better"
1,Tom Browns Science and Art of Tracking,"This book should read Tom Browns Fairytales, I wanted a book to gain some practicle knowledge of tracking, this book was a rambleing monolog about his indian mentor called grandad, only have of the book was dedicated to any details of tracking, the rest to be a fairytail about his boyhood friend, himself and grandad. If you want to learn about tracking principles forget this book, I tried hard to focus on his thoughts but he's up there with the faries I'm afraid."
2,Metal Spring Clip Broke,The metal money clip (not the magnetic one that someone else speaks of in their review) broke on mine after about 2 months. I had a very similar Tommy Hilfiger wallet for about 5 years before the metal spring clip broke.Beware if you plan on using the metal clip.
4,Amazing photography,"Absolutely amazingly beautiful video captures. As a nature video- superb. For relaxation purposes, all the rushing water- white water rafting type movement- made me anxious at times and a little dizzy. I found myself craving more still shots and more plants and flowers."
3,"Fair price/quality, but arrived with a layer of rust.","The durability of the wrench seems good, but my main gripe with this item is that it arrived with a layer of rust on the all the parts except the handle. The handle (gray part in the picture) is apparently aluminum, but the reminder is not. I understand most tools containing iron will rust if exposed to the weather or not well cared for, but to arrive that way new is a disappointment.After disassembly and a couple minutes with the wire wheel on the grinder, the rust was gone. It would have received 5 stars if not for this issue."
4,Powerful,"Another one of Shreve's great works, the character of Eden Close is one I found myself feeling sad for many of the characters. It is a haunting book, and one that will effect the reader for days after its completion. It is beautifully written and compelling."
5,really good.,Hard to put into words-but truly a great book and a must read.You won't regret reading this book.awesome and spellbinding.
4,Just ok -,The book was fine -- good condition -- arrived promptly; just never could get into the story line. Perhaps I've read too many by A. Shreve and need to move on.
2,Disappointing look at Custer,"I found this a very disappointing book. I had little knowledge of Custer before I read this book (and that was the reason I picked it up). After reading it I found I don't know much more than I did before. Huge chunks of his life seemed to be glossed over and there was way too much information about his wife for my taste. Because the only survivors of Little Bighorn were Native Americans there wasn't much known of the actual battle itself, so it is not surprising nothing new was exposed regarding that, however, I was really disappointed I didn't learn more about Custer himself"
4,Entertaining ---,"I enjoyed watching Jacque Brel portray a lonely shirt salesman. After failing to commit suicide over his lost love, Brel attaches himself to a hired gunman becoming a PAIN IN THE A.. The events that happen become a comedy. The gunman doesn't want the police involved in his business or Brels and the two get connected in outrageous circumstances. A very entertaining film."
5,it lasts,Although it makes the ipod nano a little bulky it's worth the buy. this thing lasted me for two years. Eventually it stretches out but it takes a while.
4,A fundamental book for the randomness.,"Knuth talks about the applications into informatics of the theory number.This book , written several years ago, is today the best about those facts. I have studied recently the random numbers and I have read the algebric theory of this book . It's interesting as a solutions of algebric equation must verify statistic conditions for effective randomness."
3,Fine book if you are into that kind of thing,"This book was fine, just be sure to note that it isn't the actual book, it is the study guide to help supplement the actual book. I did not really enjoy my physics course, so I don't have anything wonderful to say about this study guide, other than it might have helped had I looked at it more. No issues with the seller nor the shipping, all good in that regard :)"
5,"Useful, straight forward","This book is very useful for studying for tests, exams, and just general homework problems so that you know the material cold."
2,smells like a man's cologne!,"I tend to like about every perfume out there, unless it smells like a man's cologne.I have no idea who thought this is really a woman's scent? I had to decline the present due to the fact that I dont want to walk around smelling like a man. There was another lady that sampled it too, she made the same comment, it just amazes me how this is not something people talk about in here.Its too musky to feminine."
2,too masculine,"My husband bought this for me on accident (long story). The scent is too masculine for my tastes. Smells just like the Light Blue men's cologne. If you actually go for the unisex scent, save your money on this and go buy the CK One or imitation."
1,Conterfeit seller. No response from seller after complaint.,Perfume was clearly not real. Counterfeit. Just to verify I went to a local department store and bought some of the same perfume. The perfume from the department store smelled very different and the bottle was clearly different. I emailed the seller for a chance to fix the problem and never heard back from them. This was a gift for my wife at Christmas. Do not buy from seller. I will also be Leary of amazon purchases in the future. Don't get ripped off like I did.
5,call off the dogs...,"..the hunt is over. This is without a doubt, hands down, my all time favorite fragrance. Literally gives me a burst of sheer JOY when I spray it on myself. Its light, summery, crisp, clean, and reminds me of being on top of a windswept Italian Villa....breathing in fresh air. It's very versatile: I love that I can wear it out for a night on the town, or just spray it on in the morning to hang with my kids, go shopping, or even walk the dog! I have the perfume, the cologne, the lotions, the gel.....its lemony-soft and light and I can't recommend it enough. SIX stars!!"
5,PERFECT,"EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FASTER THAN EXPECTED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND PERFUME ONLINE THAT ISN'T A ""KNOCK OFF"" BUT THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WEARING FOR YEARS. THANK GOODNESS."
4,Clean and light,"Just as the name implies, it's light, fresh, clean and lovely. In addition it is not overwhelming or cloying. I just wish it would last longer than it does on me, although it has a better lasting power on my sister; it's her fave. Recommended."
3,My Daughter Loves This,I ordered this for my daughter who is away at college. This is her favorite scent and Amazon is the best place to purchase it because of its reasonableness of price.
2,scent was mostly alcohol,"I returned this product twice - the scent was mostly alcohol, which means the testers are either really old or the fragrance somehow separated from its alcohol base, perhaps due to poor storage and/or the hot temperatures....... very disappointing"
1,BEWARE!!!!!,"The product was a fake. Dolce & Cabbana doesnt sell a 3.4 oz bottle and the box and bottle were different colors. It had no smell to it, basically water. I confirmed this at Macys, and bought a bottle there. They were completely different. The company did credit me my money after I threatened them with consumer affairs, and ironically, they never even asked for me to return the bottle. Obviously an admission of their guilt"
1,Stinks!,Didn't care you this scent. Too overpowering. Smells like something an old lady would wear. Had to give it away.
1,Perfume did not smell like DOLCE GABBANA LIGHT BLUE,Perfume was delivered fast and packaging looked good. However I sprayed perfume and it smelled strong and not like the original LIGHT BLUE DOLCE GABBANA. I ENDED UP BUYING A DOLCE GABBANA LIGHT BLUE PERFUME AT Macy's and the smell was different and was the original smell LIGHT BLUE. I contacted seller and no response.
5,Light Blue review,"Wow, this stuff smells superb! It was very inexpensive compared to in store prices, and it got here on time and in great shape. I am extremely satisfied."
5,It is a great gift,"I love this fragance, my girlfriend ask me for it and she uses it all the time, very soft and fresh, recommeded 100%"
1,Dolce...Is that you?,"I am an avid user of Dolce & Gabbana, Light Blue. It is my signature fragrance and for some reason the product I ordered here totally missed the mark! It did not wear like the usual product I wear (purchased from high end department stores) nor did it smell quite the same. It carried a much much lighter bouquet and it evaporated like pure alcohol into the skin. It had ZERO body to it.Mind you, even in it's ""knock off"" form, this is a great smelling product so people who don't intimately know the product may not be able to tell the difference but me, aah, I am a connoisseur!"
1,Not authentic D&G Light Blue...,"I would not recommend this seller--The Perfume Spot. I truly believe the perfume I received is a knock off. The box was poorly designed--letters off center, etc...makes me think that this is not authentic D&G Light Blue--I gave it to my niece today for her birthday. She said it smells fine, but we shall see if the scent lasts etc...I should have stuck with Lord & Taylor or Nordstroms....I've learned my lesson:("
1,a fake,"there is no way this is'nt a fake i use this all the time ,had a bottle for a year and it never smelled like this.i feel this shouldn't be sold even with a somewhat lower price its too much to pay ... for the smell of alcohol."
3,Is it authentic?,"Hi, after receiving the order of D & G Light Blue, the product was partially damaged and logo letters on the bottle were peeling off. Also, once I opened the bottle and sprayed, it seems like a very much watered down version of the ""real"" product that I have used since it was released."
1,Bad product from supplier,"The scent is lovely, it is the company I purchased the product from, they sold inferior product, I think they know it was not good from the start. Will not give credit unless in original packaging, this was a Christmas gift. Hard to tell someone leave in the packaging don't throw away the box! Took 3 weeks to get delivery, couldn't cancel order in less than 24 hours after I placed the order. Company doesn't seem to be on the up and up. Now the product leaks because of bad sealing and can't return it I don't have original packaging."
2,Light Blue is tooooo Light,"This smells like nothing! I cannot smell it on me (just the faintest suggestion of citrus? Here I was expecting, OK I finally found ""fresh, lasting"" and I have got Zero.)Next time I'm in a major dept. store, I'm stopping by the D & G counter and spritzing on Light Blue there. I simply cannot believe this is without any fragrance at all! My first time to order a fragrance online that is totally a dissapointment to me."
5,Structure and Experiment,"This is a nice little book covering basic crystallography. Weighing in at a paltry 165 pages, Sands covers crystals, symmetry, groups, and experimental crystallography. Although brief, he is not overly concise (a good thing for an introductory text). He goes into enough detail to get you the basic idea with out bogging you down in the details. For example, most scientists and engineers could care less about group theory; Sands gives the rigorous mathematical definition of a group and then steps immediately back into discussing how they help us as crystallographers. The explanations are, for the most part, lucid and easy to follow. The diagrams are thought out pretty well and help the discussion. The chapters are speckled with short exercises for you to test yourself.I would strongly recommend this book if you need a crash course or refresher in crystallography, or as a supplement to other books."
2,A poorly written book...,"that goes on and on without really saying anything. Why, for example, does the author not address the real issues like SLAPP lawsuits that the powerful corporations Varian Medical Systems and celebrities Johnnie Cochran, yes the OJ attorney, use to silence reporters or as this author calls them, bloggers.A waste of money, this book."
4,"Maxine, Cincinnati, OH",This is a very good CD! I was introduced to Maria de Barros from a compilation CD that I purchased from a gift shop at the Smithsonian Institute. The song featured was Riberonzinha. I went on the internet to learn more about her and was moved to purchase this CD. She has a beautiful voice and the songs are a good representation of Cape Verdean music. I especially like her version of the song Manha de Carnaval. I recommend buying it.
3,"Good manga, but not to me!","I like anything related to detective and stuffs, but this manga is totally boring (to me). Probably, I am not into ""fantasy"" much when investigation need some help from ""zodiac."" Also, the cases are totally suck. None of those cases are interesting enough to make me keep reading. However, stand in the opposite view, this manga is quite fun to read. If you want to relax and read something to laugh, then this is a good book to buy."
2,too light and bright,"'light and bright' may suite STRAUSS WALTZES ,but i think BRAHMS HUNG.DANCES call for alot more 'gypsy lust'. some more prominent cello and even some double bass would be more appropriate. the tempo choices and changes are too weak. this is no worse than 90% of other HUNG.D cd's. if u don't mind light dance classical, then its good. but if u want gypsy flavour whilst still being in the confines of classical genre, its not here."
3,Decent book,The story line here is simple but great for kids to understand the power of not giving up. However the ending is a little weak and I thought the emphasis on yoga a little odd in the title & in the book itself. However the illustrations are great. Overall not a bad book for a young girl to understand how to get some self esteem.
3,What I didn't like about the CD and the AC adapter for said,The CD supplied with said camera didn't install in a computer which has the required software and hardware.The AC adapter didn't work with a notebook computer which has the required hardware and software
1,Cheesy Sci-Fi,This is a horrible movie. The plot is something about a killer alien that can't be stopped or something. We've seen this before. The stars of this movie no one has heard of and the dialogue was laughable. Watch the scene of the alien being chased in a hotel and laugh your head off. Don't see this movie unless u have 2.
1,What a disappointment,"I read so many good reviews of this camera that I was horrified when I saw the pictures it took. I have an old Kodak 260 which I wanted to improve upon, and this has failed. Pictures are either out of focus, 'bleached' looking with too much white, color reproduction is poor, red eye reduction fails to work - in short it fails on pretty much every criterion I wanted to improve upon. I thought at first it was me, so I read and re-read the manual, tried all manner of settings, and still each picture needs brightness and color balance, is out of focus and needs red eye reduction half the time. Also very annoying that it only warns you of low battery just before it runs out. It was a complete waste of money - only gave it 1 star because there didn't seem to be an option for zero. My five year old Kodak tank with 1.6 mega pixels is way better."
1,E18 error,"I haven't received an E18 error with an S500, but I did with my prior powershot, and that experience was enough to convince me not to purchase a Canon again until they've fixed this problem - or at least taken responsibility for it. I was able (after months of writing letters and sweet-talking customer service agents) to get it repaired under the warranty, but it's not a process I'd recommend to anyone. I'd had my camera for 6 months and been thrilled with it, and then out of nowhere the E18 message popped up. I simply have no faith in Canon digital cameras anymore (although I just bought an i960 printer and it's fantastic), and would caution anyone considering purchasing one to consider how important your investment is to you. The probability of getting an E18 seems awfully high, and Canon's utter unwillingness to deal with this problem despite years of complaints is too disconcerting to merit the risk."
1,Junk! Do NOT Buy It!!,"Over 90% of pictures I took by this Canon are blurry. No way can you fix it. I really got fed up with it. Waste your money. Waste your time. More important, waste your precious moments!"
1,Do Not Purchase this Camera!!!!,"After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight!Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again."
1,E18 Error Strikes again,If only I had known about this error before getting the camera! I received this error while on vacation several weeks ago and it rendered the camera useless. Do a search of the internet on this issue prior to purchasing. This issue has come up on several of Canon's point and shoot models and their is currently a class action lawsuit being investigated by a California based law firm.
5,I love this ultracompact cameraA wonderful small camera,"Canon have done it again and produced this year another great ultracompact camera. The Powershot S500 really hits the mark for me. Small, and well designed it is also a well-rounded performer in the digital camera world. At 5 megapixel resolutions you can take very good quality pictures. The camera itself is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It comes with 32 MB compact flash, so you may well want to upgrade this capacity. Also, a case is not supplied in the box. Still these are small minuses. Like a lot of the newer ultracompact digital cameras the S500 has a movie mode, and can capture 2-3 minutes. Outdoors it takes some very nice pictures, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by its indoor performance with flash. It is possible to take some good photos without red eye problems. You cannot really go wrong with this camera if you want a good high performance compact."
1,LCD Screen Broke Within about a Week,"While the camera worked it took great pictures.8 Days after I purchased it, however, the LCD screen no longer functioned at all - it just showed strange colors, but no images (in both the shooting and viewing modes). I can not link the problem to any event (I did not drop it, etc., I handled it carefully). I brought the camera back to the retailer who said I must have placed too much pressure on the screen and so it's my fault. I am about to send it in for warranty repair, but from what other reviewers suggest, Canon will NOT repair it for free. I had a Pentax Optio for over 3 years and I never had this problem. I do NOT recommend this camera."
4,re-animated classics.......,"When the multi-ego'd, self proclaimed ""Beat Konducta"" Madlib is grantet access to the golden vaults @ Blue Note Records, the end result is sheer brilliance. Although each song is uniquely in variance to it's origin, Madlib some how holds congruent to the original pieces. Tracks like ""Stormy"" & ""Montara"" are funky and invigorating... A dusty show of retrospect, brought into the light of the twenty first century by the only one who obviously could do so."
1,Total Junk,I just returned this. it was dirty inside and the top had a bubble in the laminated surface. The item had obviously been sitting somewhere for ever since it was filthy inside and out and the interior sides had separated from the glue holding them in. i'd expect to find this at the dollar general for $20 bucks.
5,Perfect for Family Poker Night,"I bought this set as a gift although my husband was jealous that it was going to my uncle rather than staying at home. We play ""family poker"" about twice a month; so these chips will see a lot of use. The price was excellent for the quality case and nice, heavy chips. It is not easy to find a set with enough chips for our games, and most sets this size either have numbers written on them that never correspond to our betting amounts or there are too many colors--four works great because there are far fewer black than the other colors, which allows us to use those only for our larger bets. I was very happy with this purchase, and my uncle was pleased on Christmas Eve."
1,Doesn't do what Package says,"This company is Terrible. I bought one of these things wanting a min/max temp reading.The package says ""Min/Max Temperature"" This unit does NOT display it. The instructions (on the inside after you buy it) makes no reference to it. When I get online to look at the instructions, It shows a thermometer with Humidity. I have had these devices before from ACURITE And they all had ""gliches"" Never again. I've alwayshad good luck with ""SkyScan"""
4,This Train Is Bound For Glory,"This is an excellent history of the railroad chapel cars used in the United States in the latter 1800's & early 1900's. It is a good review of how the gospel was brought into newly developed railroad towns that had no established churches and in many cases wild & wooly towns. There are many wonderful old historic pictures and bibilical quotations. You will find out how the Episcopalians, Catholics, and Baptists had these chapel cars built. Anyone who likes trains, actively involved with the church, or has lived in towns where the local railroad brought in chapel cars will really enjoy reading this book!"
3,"Nasty, nasty, nasty",The book is about a convenant of nuns which some are very lustful for one another. When one of the nuns is tragically killed they stubble upon a hidden door they do not recognize. As they accidently open the door they release a lustful demon who possesses and also has his way with all the nuns in the convenant. Is anyone safe from this unspeakable evil?At first I was getting used to this book. I don't really get off with dirty nuns(I try to keep religion and sex separate) but it did get sexy when the demon got a hold of them. Though I was disappointed because it lead into direction I didn't want it to go.
3,Best of what is available but not that great.,"This collection is the best of ornament collections.Considering the limited number of ornament collections around, this seems to be the best choice.Many ornaments are ok and many usage areas can be found.On the other hand many of them are rough, some are even ugly.Especially the ornaments with human figure and face are not good.You can not edit the art bits using a vector based software, all are in tif and jgp formats, making it hard to use them or change them.Other missing thing is an index, you have to go through the whole 270 pages to find what you want. I was looking for some fluffy sheep and couldnt find them after 30 minutes of searching.If you are looking for floral ornaments this book will do.But as an art director or graphic designer keeping some little goodies like these in this collection under your hand wont do any harm."
4,A great soundtrack,"This spectacular film of Jules Dassin reaches an accelerent with the compliment of this music. It brings into mind pictures, not only from the film, but also from the common life of the director with his Greek wife, actress Melina Mercouri, who wins the interest of the spectator with her icredible interpretation."
4,Collapsible top,Amazon sent me a second one which worked after 1st one kept collapsing but it works good!
3,could have been better,"Blows sounds essentially like an old JA album and a pretty good one at that. It's highly emotive and an obviously sincere and genuine work compared to today's era of disposable nonsense lyrics and non-melodic electronic/machine rhythms. The unfortunate thing is that for such a haughty concept as universal truth and worth the writing, both lyrically and musically, could have been something they put a little more work into. That's not to say I don't like or appreciate the concept because I like it a lot but as a package the lyrics don't flow particularly well and too many of the melodies sound forced (ie. Mau Mau the opening track).I've always liked JA and Kantner both but this album has some fabulous bright spots and really did deserve some serious reworking and polishing before putting it out."
4,Radiohead's family tree,Yeah I said it! Read my actual review on the 1990 release page. Love how cutting edge this is.
5,"QUITE POSSIBLY THE ""BEST""","THIS C/D, AND I DO HAVE THE ORIGINAL VINYL, IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST GUITAR/PIANO ALBUMS IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK & ROLL. STARTING WITH TRACK 5 TO THE END, IT'S THE BEST. ONE LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES YOU WILL BE CONVINCED. YOU CAN HEAR GRACE SLICK A LOT IN THE FOREFRONT AND THE BACKGROUND WITH LOTS OF HIDDEN GUITAR STRINGS. BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
4,memories renewed,"The album brought back memories of the vinyl days and college atmosphere. The digital format and a good set of earbuds made the music sound better than before. One play was enough though. Times are different now, and the tone of revolution is a dated theme. It would still be nice to go on A deck to look at the stars, if we only had a government that was capable of building a starship!"
5,Finding an Album from my youth,I have been searching for this album for the past year and was unable to locate it in stores or on other web sites. I found it without any problem on Amazon
3,"""Wig in a Box""","Wig in a BoxI saw a documentary on cable about this CD benefit project for a school. I really enjoyed the music and put my order in. The tops on this CD is ""Wig in a Box"" performed by The Polyphonic Spree. It is an upbeat, uplifting, slightly silly, what-the-heck, pop tune that gets into your brain and makes you sing along. At the least you will smile while you listen. Another plus is the raucous rock of ""Sugar Daddy"" performed by Frank Black. Lots of off beat stuff and some big named musical talents like Cyndi Lauper contribute. No matter what your musical tastes you will probably find something on this CD to rip an MP3 and put on your player."
2,Can't capture the original,While I love the music of Hedwig. I don't think these artists can't quite capture the magic of John Cameron Mitchell and Stephan Trask. Some are ok. But for the most part. It's just bad. The artists who contribute are excellent artists but their attempts to recreate the Hedwig magic is either mediorce or just plain bad.
5,"Haunting, thrilling, satifying story and lovely pictures","This book really stayed with me, I bought at a school book fair just because I liked the drawings on the cover, and the art inside is magical. The story is also very satisfying to children, although a little scary, because the bad scary character gets his comeuppance. A classic book that I'm sorry to see out of print."
1,Adults-Read This Book Before Reading to your Children,"Absolutely horrible book! My granddaughters love owls and I was so excited when I found this book. However, the Man Who Calls Down Owls gets killed by a bad guy and then the bad guy is killed by the owls!!! Whoever said this book is for ages 4 - 8 certainly didn't read it first. Pass on this one!"
1,"An ego trip for Majerus - an overweight, overrated coach.","A pleasent book to read only if you enjoy reading egomaniacs like Majerus espouse how wonderful a coach he is, and all that he has done for those ""fortunate"" institutions he has coached at. Not recommended."
3,Lovin' the Tyler Series,"I like the Tyler Series, just couldn't really get into this book. I don't know, I liked just about all the rest of them, though!Personally, I didn't really feel that much chemistry between the couple. I felt they had more chemistry in previous books when they were secondary characters, then when the books was written about them!"
3,"Jacket is huge, pants fit fine","I bought a size small. I'm a female about 5'9''. The pants fit great, though I have to roll over the waist once. But the jacket is quite big. Think of a guy who normally wears a size large and this jacket will fit him perfectly."
1,Do not buy this camera,"I have had this camera since April 05, and in half the time I have owned it I have been unable to take pictures. In August, it began having problems with the lens, and over 100 pictures I had on the memory card were deleted. I sent the camera back to Canon for repair, which cost me $120. It still did not work properly after Canon returned the camera, and I have sent it in twice since then. Canon will not offer replacements or opportunities to upgrade until they figure out the exact problem.I was happy with the Canon I owned previously, but this particular model has a lot of bugs and isn't worth the hassle."
2,E18 !!!,"I have owned the S410 camera for almost two years, when on New Years Eve I pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the E18 error message appeared! It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! Beware of this flaw that Canon doesn't seem to acknowledge."
2,Problems with camera's screen,"After using this camera for a mere 6 weeks, we had problems with the screen displaying wierd colours. I carry the camera in it's leather carry case, so no damage to the camera can occur.However the screen has now completely frozen up with what looks like an internal 'bruise' It's very odd and totally unusable."
1,erases memory cards,"I bought the previous model Canon Elph S400 just a year and a half ago. It worked for about a year. Now it has started erasing my memory cards so that all the pictures on it are lost. I called the Canon support number and they said I could send it in to be repaired for $155. I plan to but a new camera instead, but not a Canon."
3,"Expect more out of a 4mp camera, especially canon","I ordered this camera as a replacement/upgrade to my 2.0mp Nikon Coolpix 2500 camera. It is on its way back to Amazon for a refund. The Nikon camera takes much better pictures than this 4mp camera.The color on the canon pictures was fantastic, saturated and beautiful. The sharpness left much to be desired.Maybe my Nikon has spoiled me, but I'll stick with the 2.0mp camera for now and save my money!"
1,E18,"I own one of these cameras. It worked well for 2 yrs. Recently, after no apparent reason it stopped working. The lens is half-way out and makes a horrible noise when you turn it on. The screen shows E18. I have been looking for information on what this means and apparently is a very common problem with these cameras due to engineering flaw. If I were you, I would not buy one S400."
3,Disappointed,"The screen has been acting up since I bought it, unable to take photos... I did buy it used. However, I've been happy with this product before for multiple reasons."
2,door to compact flash broke only after 1 year,"I liked this camera a lot, bought it for $299 when new, a year ago. I never dropped it. But somehow, a piece of plastic broke on the door to the compact flash department. Took it back to the camera store, and they said it would cost $200 to repair it! What a waste of money! Now I'll buy used on Amazon or ebay next time for far less..."
2,fatally flawed,"Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use. Very nice compact size.However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again. There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced. We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed. But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon."
4,Canon coach S410,It is really good one. I am using one and bought the same one for my parents. I think they can really enjoy it.
4,Good album,Not quite the same as the vinyl.... but awfully close. Minor editing changes... very minor.A must have for Doors fans.
1,ok,"When I was younger I was a fan of this book, so I bought it again to see if it still interests me. It is not a great book for my age, and I am no longer interested in it. Elementary school boys may find it interesting. -D. Chiddix"
4,It's good,"just how fine it is.The auther word is perfect.And It is need deep thought after read it.So I buy it,no regrate."
1,"Poorly written, trite and unbelievable.",Characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. Dialog is ridiculous.Writing is clouded by digressions on pseudo-philosophicalmumbo-jumbo.
4,A Good Once A Year Read,"The Bridges of Madison County is certainly not the most well written book of our time, and there are more than a few cliches, but the love story is strong. I tend to pull this book out about once a year when I just need a good, simple love story. It takes just a couple of hours to read the book straight through, and it's worth the time.Francesca and Robert have a life-changing week together, when her husband and children are away. At the end of the week, she must decide whether to stay in her routine, predictable, life that is lacking in passion or run away with the hippie photographer. Whichever decision she makes will lay plan for the rest of her life, and both have painful consequences.This book reminds me of the power love has over each of us, and what we can and can't live without. It reminds me of promises made, and how we all rank our priorities differently but that doesn't necessarily make us right or wrong."
3,The book is not that bad!,"It seems that all the cynics and pseudo-intellectual types have a hard time with certain people who have enjoyed The Bridges of Madison County. I agree it's not F. Scott Fitzgerald or Tom Wolfe, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. The story has some merit and millions of people have enjoyed it. Not all of us read for cerebral stimulation. Some of us read for pure entertainment, and we don't care what the snobby esoteric types think. One of my friends who considers himself the ""tolerant"" type is very narrow minded when it comes to literature. Face it. Readers like different things, and it doesn't have to be great literature to grab someone. I liked the book and I will probably read it again."
2,Two-Dimensional Characters,"This book seemed so ""engineered"" -- my word for the author proceeding with a plan, then inserting cardboard characters to move through the plot. Neither character seemed more than a cutout: perfect, intelligent, witty, accomplished, talented, blah blah blah. At no point in this book could I lose myself in the plot or the characters. A disappointment."
4,A great romance for the housewife,"I thought the book was wonderful. It was easy to read, and I couldnt put it down...I had to know what would happen to Francesca and Mr. Kincaid. I read it over the weekend. I wouldnt advise reading it, if your spouse is about to go on a business trip though. Great movie too!!"
2,Great Hype Ends in Disappointment,"I decided to read this book after seeeing it on the bookshelf at my dads house. I've heard a lot of great things about this book. After I started reading it, I realized it was only a big erotic love story, not a well written drama as it was portrayed to be. I was very disappointed in the way the book turned out."
1,"The ""dumbing down"" of literature continues","Try not to laugh when Kincaid says ""I am the highway and aperegrine and all the sails that ever went to sea.""This book was highly recommended to me by a co-worker. I read it in an afternoon (Thank God that I didn't waste any more time than that on it.) and was just appalled. The dialogue was absurd, the characters pathetic. It almost read like a National Lampoon parody. I had always considered my co-worker to be reasonably intelligent (she has a doctorate for God's sake) but after I read this I never looked at her quite the same.This book should appeal to those who consider ""The Young and the Restless"" art."
3,simple beauty and romance,"A delightfully poetic work. A romance in the truest sense - not only the passionate stirrings of the heart, but a delicate and thoughtful romance with the beauty of nature."
1,"Ah, fer cryin' out loud...","I don't mean to sound insensitive, but if this book were a horse, I'd have to shoot it. No, really; it's that bad. I don't know a single English professor who ever read it. It was smarmy and pretentious. When I read the line about a ""star creature on a comet's tail"", I was groaning out loud. And when I read ""I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea"", I found myself hoping that those sails would be capsized by a hurricane. And the part where Francesca's children read about her lovemaking really creeped me out.""Yes, kids, nothing says healthy like reading about your mother's adulterous sexual escapades.""Overall, despite its hype, this is nothing we haven't seen before. You read one romance novel, you've read 'em all. Kind of like Stephen King novels. If you're truly curious, pick it up at the library. You'l laugh until you realize that it's not a comedy."
4,The Bridges of Madison County,"The Bridges of Madison County, is a touching and inspiring book that teaches you to go for your dreams but also to accept your responsibilities and then take action. The love that Robert and Francesca have for each other is so strong you can almost feel it while you read the book, (which i could not put down). The story is just so sweet because its about a one of the last cowboys and simple farm wife that fall in love under the covered bridges of madison county, there are some twists and turns along the way, but you'll just have to read it for yourself to find out, it is a great book that I would suggest to anyone looking for a good, sweet love story. That is why I give this book four stars and I cant wait to rent the DVD as well."
2,This is a parody of itself,"There are a couple of other hilarious ones, including the Butches of Madison County and the Fridges of Madison county. The latter is my favorite"
3,I recommend it!,"It's not a bad book. I think it's well written (a little on the ""artsy"" side). It's a book about ""chemistry"" between two human beings. The kind of chemistry that you can lose yourself in."
2,"Don't give up on Waller, just rent the movie!","I had read Bridges before I'd ever seen the movie, but after doing a Tearjerker marathon DVD night with the girlfriends, I was struck by how much better the movie was than the book. I think Waller really did make an effort to reflect how these two people feel and what they meant to each other, even years later, but failed miserably to do so. Maybe it was the challenge of trying to put it all in words versus watching the romance being play out on screen. I have not read his other books, but I certainly am looking for them now (that's why I was on amazon.com today). I'm not giving up on him, but I would recommend the movie over the book any time!"
2,Compare and contrast the two books.,The Fridges of Madison County was laughably simple. This book is simply laughable.
2,Soppy,"I love romance novels. I love reading Mills and Boon as well as Avon romances. This wasn't a romance novel. It was pointless. Let me save you from having to read it:-* The first 20 or so pages detail the main hero's life. I will sum it up for you: he is a photographer. He travels. He has no one in his life.* Next 100 or so pages detail four days he spends with a middle aged married woman. They cook dinner. They dance. They have sex. Then the story goes on about how they never see eachother again, yet pine for each other alot. They die.* Last 30 pages detail her children discovering about her affair, and about a musician who met him.Thank goodness the book is only short!I would recomend this to middle aged women who feel like they are in a rut."
1,Romance Novel With a Yuppy Cover,"After having heard a lot of the women I know just gushing excitement over this book a few years back, I finally decided to read it. Boy was I disappointed. This book is nothing more than a run of the mill romance novel with a yuppy cover. The character development is shallow and the story is boring. I found it difficult to finish and am glad I got it from the library instead of spending good money on it. So, unless romance novels are your thing, I'd advise you to look for another book to spend your hard earned money on."
2,"OK, I admit it....",I stayed with this sappy book.... but it really was a loser. The family book discussion lasted only about 20 minutes.
1,"This book defines ""overrated""","After hearing all the hype, I picked it up. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This has to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The dialogue is forced, unreal and just plain boring. The storyline is less than romantic, simply another re-hash of the old farmer's wife and the milkman story. I'm astounded that people are actually reading this drivel, never mind that so many actually find it remotely interesting"
5,A Touching Story,This novel is the most beautiful novel I have ever read. The use of imagery is outstanding. Throught the whole novel I was constanly on the edge of my seat because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I will have to say that the best part of novel has to be the last 2 or 3 chapters because it was so moving I was crying almost non-stop.
5,Bitter sweet love,"I'm a romantic at heart and this book makes me weep. It is just so heartwrenching when two people love each other the way they do and can't be together. Francisca will forever be haunted by her guilt if she leaves her children and husband. She did the right thing, but it was so painful to see her choose between the man she loves and her duty as a wife and mother.I just wish they can be together. What is even more sad is, they never met again. Yet that love remains. On the other hand, upon reflection, would that love still remain if she did choose to be with her lover ? The answer to that we will never know."
2,Rather silly,"Waller is a good essayist but a poor novelist. He has taken the old traveling salesman-farmer's daughter routine and tried to con us into thinking it is a real romance. Why did the woman keep a secret for 25 years and then feel compelled to blab the whole thing to, of all people, her own children? What is glamorous about a four-day roll in the hay with a man she knows she will never see again? If he is such a hotshot photographer, why does he toss his highpriced equipment into the back of a pickup where it will get dusty and unusable, and worse yet stolen? Give me a break."
1,Unfortunate waste of potential (and paper....and your time),"This book is essentially worthless drivel. ""He moves like a gazelle.."" ?!? Is the author serious? To say the book is cliche ridden is an understatement. The writing is sophomoric and the characters are developed not in action, but in ridiculous cliched descriptions like the gazelle simile. The saddest thing is that this could have been a great story. The plot has potential. A long lost forbidden and passionate love affair, discovered after the two main players are deceased. The woman's children having to figure out what happened years ago based on their dead mother's diary. This book could have been brilliant and instead its like a bad passage from the Song of Soloman. Don't waste your time reading this rubbish."
1,Ego stroking and maudlin,"When this book showed up on everyone's must read list I stepped out of character and read it. In the opening section of the book Waller compares himself to the hero, who he has been following/researching in order to complete the tale. He believes that he and the hero are now practically the same person. He then portrays a person with no faults, complete self-reliance, who is strong and sensitive. He lovingly strokes this character all throughout the book. There wasn't much more to it besides some very sad people who made some difficult decisions and didn't want to live with them anymore. Poor babies. I couldn't get over the fact that he was essentially writing this story about what an amazing person he himself is. By the time I was through with it, about a half an hour later, I resigned myself to never read a book off the best seller list again. Waller is not a literary author, he is a trashy romance novelist."
1,This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read,"...and I have read some pretty bad ones in my lifetime! The only way I was able to get through is was on a Thanksgiving day drive to my cousin's. Everyone in the car took turns reading it aloud. It's a maudlin, unrealistic, hideous piece of garbage. The melodramatic readings made it merely palatable. I fear for the fans of this book."
1,don't let him write a sequel,"Why is this book in the ""Literature and Fiction"" section? It should be considered a Romance - and a very poorly written one at that. The plot is mawkish but vaguely plausible. With compelling characters, it might have been interesting. However, the characters are unbelievably flat - they never do anything unexpected, they have no faults, and as a result, the reader has no interest in what happens to them. Waller's florid text does not improve matters. I have not read such a poorly-written book in years. The ""2"" rating is generous.If you're looking for something romantic, don't read this book - it will turn you into a cynic. Read ""A Room with a View"" instead."
3,Don't Give Up On Waller After Reading This Book.,"Okay, so maybe this Romance Novel slips over the edge of mushy sentimentalism. I read this years ago when it came out and promptly dismissed the writer. DON'T DO THIS. You will miss reading the thought-provoking insights and well-crafted writing of an author who possesses the story-telling skills and lyricism of Wallace Stegner. I urge you to read One Good Road is Enough (essays). One essay in this book is the best summary I've read on how to write well. Some of the later fiction is better than ""Bridges"". This is a gifted writer."
1,Worse than useless!,"Avoid LaCie drives at all costs.The build quality might be impressive but the performance is terrible. I made the mistake of buying two LaCie drives and after a very short time, both failed. These things are bought for protecting data and long term storage. If you love your photos, never trust them to a LaCie.Avoid at all costs."
5,I Simply Love this CD,My niece purchased a copy of this CD for me a few years ago. I totally wore it out by playing it so much. I had to purchase another one. Maybe I should have ordered 2!The worship music is superior and the upbeat music makes the heart rejoice!
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"I think that this is the best Vicki Yohi CD ever, to me anyway. Her voice is so annointed. The songs on this disc really spoke to me. I ended up on my face humbled by the annointing in this music. All of my friends say the same thing. My children know akl the songs. Very powerful. My sons 3rd grade class loves it! I highly recommend."
2,Not a good choice - even for its price!,"This is the worst Bolero I've ever heard. I could hardly believe this is performed by a professional orchestra! From the very first note (well, beat in fact), the drum is lifeless and boring. Drums are supposed to make this song go forward, no dragging behind. But that was exactly how I felt.Also, most of the solo are just plainly BAD. They basically sound like some high school students doing it for the first time. I also think they got some jazz saxophone player doing the solo, for they totally ruined the smoothness of this classical composition.As for other songs in this CD. They are not really much better, the whole orchestra is very dull. But I address heavily on Bolero because I hate to see when someone ruin a classic piece!!!"
3,Don't bother with the thicker casing,"I bought these because for some reason I thought it would be better to have a durable lining. Chances are, and in my case I didn't, need such a strong cable. It just makes it very difficult to snake around in tight spaces. Unless it is an application that will really demand such overbuild; stick with the cheaper, more flexible stuff. Picture, of course, was cumpletely fine."
5,Experimental Cute Music,"If you want extreme cute, try Yann Tomita's project called The Doopees. Talk about strange! This is the first example I have come across of this experimental cute music style, and I think that's because Tomita invented it. The album is narrated by two squirrel-pitched girlbots who throughout the album are questioning the true meaning of love. Full of strange chirps and sine wave loop de loops, samples and oddball covers, anytime is a good time for Doopee Time. I like to put this on right before I go to sleep because it's sort of soothing and then it gives me some really bizarre, wonderful dreams."
2,Tedious and repetitive,"While the author is obviously a competent writer and excels at description, he is overly reptitious. The pacing was slow and tedious, which did litle to create tension or anticipation. The only thing I anticipated was the end of the book. The characters seemed one dimensional. I never felt like I knew them or particularly cared about them. Whereas we are subjected to lengthy observations of the settings, we are seldom exposed to the emotions and feelings of the characters. We are told that John falls in love with Josie, but nothing other than proximity even hints at the reason why. I didn't like Cold Mountain either but will admit that it was technically well written, as is this book."
1,Lacks suspense and credibility.,"Mostly an excuse for the author to play out his fantasy of gorgeous women falling in love with him for no good reason. The narrative wanders into his background of compulsive gambling, also for no good reason except that his past interrupts whatever small narrative flow there is (and there isn't much). The victims are relentlessly uninteresting (who cares if they live or die...not this reader). He has created possibly a most boring and unconvincing set of serial murderers with a paticularly petty excuse for their deeds. Give this one a pass."
2,Ok book I say don't get it.,I think this book is ok. There are some parts where it should be more interesting. Very boring at times.
3,Still relevant today,"Out of curiosity, I chose to read some of Himes' work to get a feel for what has been written about him. While this book contains some valuable insight into the racial climate on the West coast during the war, some readers may find the writing stiff and overworked. Luckily, the book is short (less than 300 pages) so you can just go through it."
4,Adonis with issues,"The first few pages are written in a glitzy, sophomoric style that is grating. Fortunately the book straightens out into a well-researched and well-written history of LA, the LAT and the Chandler/Otis families. Otis Chandler is the most interesting person in the book, a driven, hollow man. The book misses some opportunities to delve deeper into Otis. For example, in the sections on deer hunting it comes as close as anywhere to approaching the mind of Otis, the way it was tormented by killing, and yet driven to kill. Couldn't the author have worked with this more throughout the biography?"
1,mistake,this book was not what I thought it would be its not historical takes place between the present and the future which I hate as a conseqeunce I cannot give it a fiar reveiw it is about poeple from the futre who travel back and forth to the present and the future. cannot recommend
2,This is The Specials???,"This is The Specials? It's nothing in comparison to the 2-Tone band we know and love. I am going to review this album as another band, say The Sputniks. The Sputniks have a very good blend between horns and vocals. The tunes on this album have a the great traditional sound of the 2-tone era with a kick ass edge. Of course the album doesn't do justice to seeing The Sputniks. The energy put into the album is great, but seeing them live just doesn't compare. The Specials have officially sold out; hearing ""It's You"" played in Applebee's, just ruined it for me. So now, they are going to be referred to as the band formally known as The Specials"
4,Good. quite good,"I think this album is closer to the old Specials. SOme of these tracks are worth constant spinning. especially ""No Big Deal"", ""Tears In My Beer"", ""Fearful"" and many others on this album. Also, the CD and our music addiction enabler, Amazon here, dont list the 3 bonus tracks on this CD. BONUS FACT! In the Smashmouth video for ""Allstars"", during the scene where they play in the garage, there is a *SPECIALS* poster on the wall, which has ""THE SPECIALS"" removed, presummably due to copywright/royalty conflicts. check that video out, buy this cd, and stay Rude"
4,I'm still impressed,"Enough said about the old vs. the new. I'm happy to own this CD and anyone who knows anything about the band should be able to realize that The Specials are able to illustrate their particular point of view and their current frame of reference better than most any band recording today. They aren't 20 anymore (though judging by Roddy's exploits in Buffalo this summer you might think they were) and their music reflects that. It's still us against them, working class upfront take what you will, and still pretty danm good."
2,CAN'T STAND A WAFFLING MAN,"It started off good, I was looking forward to reading it but as I continued to do so, it became tedious. I forced myself to finish. It had all the makings of truly good read. The plot was great and the characters were interesting. Or so I thought. The Blake character waffled too much, sometimes he loved her, sometimes he didn't. A very irritating trait in any man. Melinda was somewhat interesting but her accepting attitude towards Blake's indecision reminded me of a floor mat. I really enjoyed Ms. Forster's earlier books and this one will not stop me from reading any future ones, however, I'd skip this one and go read ""Against the Wind"" were I you. It's one of her best works."
2,I couldn't finish it,"The ambivalence drove me crazy. There were paragraphs were Ms Forster wrote how much Blake loved the woman at the beginning, then at the end he couldn't stand her or didn't want to be with her or thought the worst of her or some such nonsense.The Heroine was just as bad and believe it or not they'd both had feelings for each other for 5 years. Ok so she was married so they didn't act on those feelings etc and he thought she was a gold digger, so I understood where Ms Forester wanted to go but she didn't get there.The plot had some substance but I ran out of patience with the characters.This is the second book of hers that I've found disappointing. Not sure I'm going to waste my time with another."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I am sorry, but this was the worst I have ever read. The characters were difficult to follow. In 1 sentence they were all over each other and then in the next sentence they were upset and outraged with each other. They were too wishy washy. I didnt understand why Melinda was so outraged about Blake trying to protect his client in regards to the foundation. I think she was over the top with her reaction. I think the writing style and the dialogue were too old fashioned. It was almost like the characters were stuck in a time warp. The plot was pretty good but the deliverance was not."
1,Disappointing,"Even though the product claims to be compatible with Windows and Linux, it has 1/ no drivers for any Linux system and 2/ does not work with Vista."
3,Mostly flat Mozart,"I have owned this CD for a very long time but for some reason I never reviewed it. When I saw 4 five star ratings, I was somewhat shocked because I really cannot stand these performances. I gave it three stars only because the playing is quite precise and their is nothing really bad about the interepretations. However, the performances have very little spontanaiety or passion. The 34th, one of my favorites, is the dullest of all while the 39th is the best. Number 35 ranks somewhere in between. All of these symphonies are available in far superior performances. I would look elsewhere."
3,"A Little ""Quiet Man""","How can a movie produced by and starring Pierce Brosnan at the height of his James Bond fame not get a wide theatrical release? This is the sweet story of a young Black man from America who journeys to Ireland after his mother's death to complete her last wish and winds up caught in the events that drove her away decades earlier when he starts a romance with the daughter of his mother's former love (Pierce Brosnan). Better than Brosnan's other Irish effort, Evelyn, that's for sure."
3,"Starts out good, but disappoints at the end","At first, I thought that I was really going to love this book. The main character was funny and irreverent. I particularly liked the passage where she told her maid where the children were (""oh, one's out back playing with knives, another has been kidnapped by Indians, and the third is in the living room playing with the scissors). But once she goes from her life into the forest to search for the lost little girl, the story really does ramble. I was quite bored with it. I finished the book, but only because I wanted to find out if they ever found the lost girl. I was glad to be through when I did finish and could move on to something better."
5,EXCELLENT,"If you are a fan of hockey, this is a must! I couldn't put it down. One story after another, after another. Next time you see the Cup, you'll think back to all of the hilarious things the Cup's been through. Five star, double thumbs up!"
5,I want to join the Cake Club!,"I loved both the recipes and the stories in this sweet little book. The retro pictures are a nice accompaniment to the funny and sometimes bittersweet tales of these women. The Brown Sugar Pound Cake is absolutely sinful! I also tried the jumbo sugar cookies with lemon icing, wonderful with a nice cup of tea. I would love to have met these women...they sound like true ""steel magnolias"". I hope to see more from this author."
1,A Lefty Polemic,"I only need to read the description of this so-called documentary to see it's a polemic that won't let facts get in the way of its agenda. For example, the bald assertion that Cheney steered defense contracts to Halliburton flies in the face of audits that found to the contrary. The acquisition officers themselves complained to the press that the Halliburton contracts were handled via the normal government process and that it slandered them to say otherwise. I am even less impressed with the assertion that follows this slander that this polemic reveals nothing new because everyone knows it's true. That's a pretty tired rhetorical trick: Strongly assert your case has already been proven and move on. The people who actually handled these contracts know otherwise. I doubt they will be featured in this propaganda piece."
1,What a bunch of lies!,"I quit watching after hearing the outright lies from a so called expert who said Japan had been trying to surrender for the last year of WWII. What a bunch of crap. Any history book will tell you this isn't true. The worst battles of the war were fought against Japan the last year of the war. Many civilians committed suicide rather then surrender when the US won a battle. That's a funny way for a country to try to surrender. Watch Ken Burns ""The War"" to find out why we needed to drop the Bomb. No one alive at the time disagreed with that decision."
2,Contains good characters for beginners but lacks something,"This book contains good Kanji for beginner level learners. But it does not have much examples of how to use the character. Definitions next to characters are very confusing and not clear. One of my biggest concerns is that definitions, pronunciation, and kun(meaning of the character written in Japanese) are all written in English instead of Kana. I would suggest that you choose another book. If you still want to buy this book, then consider once more and read other customers' reviews carefully."
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful book; I couldn't be happier with it. I've got the ""Yookoso! A Guide to Contemporary Japanese""'s workbook (it's for my Japanese class), but I prefer this book much more. It not only enables you to learn the Kanji, but it even has a section at the front giving you instructions on how to test yourself; how to cut an index card so you can test yourself on either writing the character itself, it's on/kun readings, it's meanings, etc. The characters are written in awesome calligraphy in both brush and pen; all this said, I love it ^_^."
1,not useful at all,"This book is essentially a listing of 2000 Kanji with two examples of howthey are used in compounds. There is no kanji lookup system, no discussionof radicals, and no order to the list. So if you find a kanji that you do not know, there is no way to look it up in this book. My Kanji Learner's Dictionary is much more useful. I'm confused as to why someone would publish a book like this - it is really not useful at all."
2,In need dire need for update,"My bad, I noticed too late that this is a 1987 publication... let's do the math..yeap that's 25 years Outdated.I'm a month into studying japanese for personal trip, I,m studying on my own and I already learned my kana (both hiragana and katakana)Why romaji... it would have been far more helpful to have kana. If you already made the decision to learn kanji, romaji is a waist of space.what's with the handwritten kanji, the book waists valuable space by repeating kanji for no apparent reason, mostly illegiblethe main kanji is hard to read as it uses a less than appealing font and has the stroke numbers included taking away from having a clean view of the kanjiand the index didn't correlate"
4,"Interesting, but has some index problems","First let me say I am not studying Japanese. I study writing systems and letterforms and I bought this book because I wanted to see how the characters for various objects differed (like tree versus branch, and so on). For what I'm doing, I need to be able to look up a word in the index and then go to the page with the Kanji character. However, several things I tried to look up had the wrong page number* referenced.* I've since been informed by a reader that these are not page numbers, but another type of indexing system. How silly of me to expect numbers in an index to be page references! I still vote for adding a traditional index of meaning-and-page-number, which is NOT unfeasible to add to a book of that size. Tedious yes, but not impossible."
1,worst training pads ever,These were supposed to be extra thick?? They leaked all over my floor with just one pee.I have a 6LB puppy and would not reccommend these to anyone.
4,Order review,"I was very happy with the Book The Good Old Boys, that I ordered thru you. Very good condition and fast delivery. But also ordered the movie of the same and it did not work at all so probably wont be using you again."
4,"A helpful book, but far from easy.","Compared to Wolf and Mandel's tome ""Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics"", this book gives the reader a lighter job on math without him reading over 100 pages on probability theory and fourier transform. However, this book has two major drawbacks:1. The author keeps refering to later chapters on some important concept. When I read the first two chapters, I have many undefined concept and unanswered questions, whose answer may be put in chapter 16! For those who are already familiar with this field, it may not be a problem. But a rookie may want a lucid and detailed introduction in the beginning.2. Some calculation should be elaborated because the result is far from obvious."
5,AWESOME,"I bought this CD when it came out, after DCB was the worship band at our church camp in Colorado Summer '03. They're awesome. Their music is very unique and powerful. I love being able to worship with them."
5,Illuminate is one for the ages,"David Crowder Band steps it up another notch on this new CD. The music is absolutely amazing. The originality in the lyrics and arrangements of the songs is inspiring, making this CD an incredible one to listen to over and over. This is definitely the best worship CD of the year and one of the best ever in my opinion. From the rockin guitars on ""Open Skies"" and ""No One Like You"" to the intimate ballad ""Only You"" to the musical tidal wave of ""Coming Towards"" this CD has it all! If you don't have it, get it today and spread the word! And if you haven't let David Crowder lead you in worship, then you've missed out. His worship leading is exciting and led by the Holy Spirit. I appreciate his heart. Oh yeah, buy Illuminate now!"
5,Strong album with great diversity,"I like this album because it presents the full range of the David Crowder Band's talents. There are some great upbeat songs such as ""Revolutionary Love"", ""Open Skies"", and ""No One Like You"". All of which are very strong musically and lyrically. The album also offers some slower, more thoughtful songs such as ""O Praise Him"", ""Only You"", and ""Deliver Me"".The David Crowder Band continues to impress me. I like their sound, their lyrics, and abilty to bring a fresh sound to the modern Christian music movement. I highly recommend this album to any fan of the DCB. You will enjoy this album. For those who are unfamiliar with the band, this album could be a great starting point."
1,AWFUL!,I've used a lot of different types of potty pad and these are by far the worst. I shouldn't be suprised as they were so cheap. They claim to be leak proof--NOT TRUE! I might as well let my puppy just wet on the floor. They do not distribute evenly and make a huge mess. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!
1,"Another lousy book by a ""smart"" theologian","Written by someone who thinks he knows better than 2000 years of theology. I verified the heresies denounced by a previous review dated March 27, 2003. Well, it's your money and you're free to waste it ;-)"
4,Sixties novel about a nuclear war,"This is a dated but fascinating novel about an apocalyptic nuclear war and a group of Americans in a millionaire's elaborate nuclear shelter who deal with various issues of survival as weeks, months, and eventually longer goes by.The psychological plot inside the shelter is balanced by a narrative of events in the world outside, sometimes brought by TV or radio reports from onlookers in the southern hemisphere, sometimes narratives of actions on surviving American ships and Russian bases.Some of the behavior is well-plotted and psychologically apt, as when the know-it-all multi-millionaire who 'takes care of' his 'weak' alcoholic wife realizes that everyone knows that he had been hiding a mistress and goes into a funk. Although this is about a future that never was, it is still a book worth reading."
5,Mystery of the Ages,This book was an eye opener. It was not written by a man but it was inspired by God. If you read this book with the Bible next to it you will understand the Bible more and have a better understanding of life and God's way of life.
4,Pure brit pop,"this soundtrack was a surprising winner for me but I am sure that most people will buy it for Aqua - that is a shame as there are other songs on this album that deserve as much (if not more) praise and recognition. Standout tracks for me include Miracle by Olive (trippy and soothing), thankyou ( a legendary track from the brilliant vocal talents of Dido), the uplifing On My Own (covered by Peach Union), Have fun Go Mad by Blair (brilliant britpop mayhem) and Amateur (by the wonderful Aimee Mann - for another stand out song, listen to You Could Make a Killing' on the soundtrack to Cruel Intentions).This soundtrack is both a party album and a relaxing afternoon listen. Get it. You wont regret it."
4,A very good resource,"I use this book in my qualitative methods class for EdD students in a school of education. The book covers a lot of the topics that I want to cover, and I think the students find the book to be relatively accessible and jargon-free."
5,it's about time.......,"I've grown tired of modern worship bands that are geared to the 30+ crowd. Finally, a good band has come to save the youth of America! Telecast is extremely catchy brit rock along the lines of coldplay, travis, etc. But it also is 100% pure praise music that goes straight up to glorify God. Every last moment of this cd is praise, unlike most other contemporary christian rock geared to youth which is lacking a real message and is really just modern rock without sex and profanity. A must own cd for the young, or young at heart christian."
3,3 star for CCD problem but 5 stars for a superb camera for about 3 years,"Superb point and shoot camera, bright and colorful pictures, excelent movie mode (with zooming and sound), but on November 2007 begins with the ""flickering lcd screen"" and about a week later no image, no photo, no nada (nothing), i was able to review my taken photos and movies but i can't take new pictures, i was a victim of the infamous CCD problem for this model, you can read about it at :http://www.imaging-resource.com/badccds.htmlthere under the ""Canon"" section you can find this little Gem (what a pity and waste of money)."
4,good deal for the price,"This camera is a good deal for the price. You get a lot of features. However, focusing in lower light seems to be a challenge. Also, in video mode the focusing is always adjusting. The zoom is great and otherwise the videos are great. Pictures are excellent quality. Would buy again because of all you get at this price."
4,Very aggressive.,Super fast stock removal for when you want to re profile a dull or damaged edge. But be ready to spend some quality time with finer hones to remove the DEEP scratches this one leaves.
5,An Excellent Quality Chair,"I was looking for another one of these chairs, so I thought I would leave a review. We bought our first one exactly like the one picture (without cushion) about 20 years ago. It is still very strong and the adjustable arms still work well after all these years and we use it frequently. The chair is for my husband, who is a very tall and large guy. It has no problem holding his weight of over 300 lbs. I want one for myself, because it is very comfortable even without a cushion. You can't go wrong with this chair. Since we paid $30 20 years ago, I'm having a bit of price shock at today's rates, but it is worth it. We do keep it in the garage when no one is using it, so that helps with the longevity instead of leaving it out in the weather all of the time."
4,bruckner 4th symphony,"This recording has been praised in The American Record Guide for many years. It is a well executed performance with the Vienna Philamonic orchestra.Those glorious horns so suited to Bruckners music.Boehm shapes the structure well. He builds tension slowly. Very important in this composers music,I Would prefer a little more urgency. That doesnt mean fast. Good early Decca sound.Add the Boehm to your collection.Especially at its decent price..."
3,"Just OK, not outstanding...","I guess I didn't like this CD as much as some others. Maybe it's just not my brand of techno-dance music. It wasn't bad, but only a couple of the songs grabbed my interest much."
4,Good beginner book,Good book. However it is mainly aimed at the beginner crowed. Seasoned J2EE developers will find little use for the examples and material. It does however introduce a beginner to implementing and deploying a end-to-end based J2EE application in Jboss and other Application servers for that matter. For the price it is not bad; on the shelf in the office for those learning.
1,Should be called JBoss Out To Lunch,This book is cringingly useless.I have had this book for two years. It has never solved any technical problem. Google is a better resource.
1,Not a jboss book :-(,I bought this book to gain some knowledge on JBOss - instead what i was getting was a book with lecture on how to code J2EE or ejb! Not a book for JBoss!
3,straight-forward bland performance,"although (i think) the orchestra and the conductor must have worked hard on this, as a lover of classical music and having heard some of the better recordings of this symphony (bohm and vpo for one), i am compelled say this is just a not very interesting text performance of the symphony (not text in a sense that karl bohm displays but rather just a not interesting performance) so... not recommended at all... if you want a budget price, any 6th from eloquence series should do better than this"
5,Corey Haim's rump is what makes this movie,"Despite being a below-average thriller, ""Blown Away"" was made entirely worthwhile with the well-choreographed nude scenes between the beautiful Nicole Eggert and the always-hot Corey Haim. Corey's nice behind is the biggest plus of this movie, but Nicole's beautiful naked body is also well worth it. The blue lighting during the nude scenes shows a cinematographer who knew what he (or she) was doing. Well Done!"
4,Great for intuitive understanding,"The book places more emphasis on an intuitive grasp of the complex mathematics involved, though this must mean giving up rigour to an extent."
3,Good but...,"Very good introduction book, but with some typos. I had read it first from my friend when I was starting up in finance. But bought it anyway because I thought it had some nice coverage on certain topics that are not well explained on implied in 99% of other books. For a startup person who is familiar with PDE and some probability theory the least can understand most of the subject matter. I would call this more of an ""introduction book""."
5,great cd,It is a great cd as it was a present to my wife. The cd is in the car cd player. This cd is excellent quality.Thank You
4,The mamas and papas,This collection of old songs brings back memonies of when I a teenager and listen to this music. This collection of songs are one of my favories.
2,Disappointed,"I should have stuck to what I know is good and that was their album ""If you can believe your eyes and ears"". This CD has a lot of music on it that I wasn't familiar with and the some of the ones I was familiar with were not near as good as the original recordings. Note to self don't waste your money on this CD."
2,The Mamas ans Papas: Greatest Hits,"I was so looking forward to receiving this cd and going back, in fine baby boomer fashion, to the 60's. Well, what a disappointment. The songs are just fine and did indeed bring back fond memories, but the quality is horrible. If this thing was remastered, it was done very poorly. Not worth the trouble of ""iPodding""."
1,Difficult read,"I feel like the odd one out here, unlike the other reviews I was not impressed by the writing in this book. It took forever to read this because it was written poorly. The beginning is slow and the author throws so many names, dates, and sub-plots into the story that I found my self rereading several pages in order to figure out who was who."
2,"Same Book, Different Author........","Although I didn't finish this book, the book, ""Whatever Mother Says..."", is this EXACT story written by Wensley Clarkson! However, in Wensley's book, Teresa had THREE sons and THREE daughters. The oldest son had left home and wasn't involved with the crimes, but was involved in the majority of the abuse. The only thing I didn't like about Wensley Clarkson's version is that you never find out what happened to the mother! There should be an updated book written including the outcome of the trial. And to ""tonlo from Pembroke Pines, Florida"", ""Whatever Mother Says..."" DOES have pictures of EVERYONE!!!"
3,"Sorry, but I had to tell you...","Sorry, I haven't watched this movie yet, so no review. But I'll bet this was written by an Iraq war vet. I was there in Desert Storm and we stayed at a place that was crawling with camel spiders. They were creepy!! Guys would catch them and have camel spider fights at night. These spiders were Huge, ugly, and aggressive. I saw one eat a bird! I kid you not! We were a tough Aviation unit (oxymoron?), but we were more frightened of those spiders than any enemy forces."
3,A very mixed bag,"Constructed as 'an alternate history of the Who' by Entwistle, this grab-bag of outtakes contains quite a few gems amongst the chaff. This remastered edition adds a slew of off-cuts and is all the better for it. 'Naked Eye', 'Water' and 'Pure And Easy', to name but three of the tracks here, all deserve classic status, and I've always loved John's mordant 'Postcard'. For the dedicated fan, perhaps, but when is it possible not to be a dedicated fan of the Who?"
4,Some Lost Who Songs!,"This CD is a nice expansion from the original album, and even if it deviates from the original running order (it's presented in chronological order), it's still an enjoyable listen. And there are some classic songs here; ""Young Man Blues"", ""Pure And Easy"", ""Long Live Rock"", and my personal favorite ""Naked Eye"".Soundwise, this CD blows away all previous editions."
5,CD purchase,"Very impressed with the service, the condition of the item and the trouble taken to protect the goods."
1,CONFEDERATE EAR POLLUTION,"I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR GROUP X'S CD....AND IT TURNS OUT ANOTHER BAND HAS A SONG CALLED BANG BANG BANG, SO I HAD A LISTIN.AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST BAND I'VE EVER HEARD. THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE THIS SORT OF CACAPHONIC GARBAGE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP IN GUANTANAMO BAY WITH THE TERRORISTS AND NEVER GET A TRIAL. IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO GOOD SOUTHERN MUSIC, GET SOME PANTERA.PS AMAZON YOU SHOULD SELL GROUP X'S CD."
1,Modern Hype,"I couldn't pass their look--so masculine, no waist or hips! They all had squad, highly muscular bodies. I like to maintain my curves, so will stick to the older ""Firm"" videos and DVD's, where real women guide you through real exercise. I rather stand the 80's music than this! (You can judge the style by the cover of this DVD: her bra strap showing, vulgar fashion trend that American women have adopted and is extremely tasteless.)"
2,impossible to follow,"While I do think this video could give you a great workout, there is no way to burn 500 calories or even get through it when you have to stop and figure out what is going on. She is impossible to follow and does not give cues that you can understand until she has already moved on. It is ridiculous!I have tried it a few times and repeatedly have to stop and watch to figure out what she is actually doing, then restart, by then I am behind. And....I am not a beginner.I really wanted this to be a great video, but it just isnt worth the effort."
2,Its ok but be careful on some of the transitioning,"I got this workout to see if I'd like them before buying their new slim in 30 series. I have done kettle wox, Zumba, P90X, and Brazilian Butt Lift series. I found that it had some good moves but some segments were done so quick it was hard to catch onto what she was doing. I also found that some of the transitioning between weights and non weights was too quick. I actually strained my left back muscles doing this workout and that has never happened with any of the harder programs. I like changing things up and will do this occasionally but not as often as some of my other programs. Just wasn't impressed by it."
3,Not my favorite Firm workout,"I own about a dozen firm DVDs and do them almost every weekday morning. This workout and the other one that Kelsie leads are my least favorite. Her moves are easy enough to follow but the quality isn't the same as the rest of the Firm workouts. The studio is different-- it looks outdated and the other Firm workout girls aren't the experienced ones you usually see. This DVD is okay, just doesn't have the overall great feeling I get from the rest of the Firm workouts."
4,Sweaty!,"This is a pretty decent workout. Kelsie keeps you moving the entire time, which is great...prevents boredom. I enjoyed her personality. It's a solid workout, by the end I was drenched in sweat. I would recommend this to intermediate exercisers and up.There are some negative aspects ,that IMO, could make or break your decision on purchasing this. Her cueing gets ahead of itself, which causes some confusion. The choreography can be a little complex at times, so if coordination isn't your strong point...skip this workout. Also, if you have knee problems, definately steer clear of this.Overall, I enjoyed the 500 calorie workout. For me, some of the lunges seemed dangerous on the knees. Other than that, this is a keeper for me! It offers an excellent whole body workout =)"
1,I Don't Get It,This CD is not for people who are not familiar with the firm. There seems to be a variation of 100 moves at any given moment. I couldn't keep up...not because the workout was hard but the directions and the moves were to many at one time. I used this dvd once and haven't looked by since. I love the idea of a 500 calorie burn workout in one but I just don't get it.
3,Moves too fast!,This video was ok. But this woman moved way too fast to do the exercises properly and with good form holding weights. It was crazy. I slowed it down to focus on my form but then had to keep rewinding to catch up and not lose out on reps.
4,Effective,"A very good workout. As others said, there are a lot of lunges. I like that she combines a lot of moves so you really maximize your work out. It's hard but achievable. The only area for improvement would be the music and a little more creativity in the moves. It's not a fun workout but it is an effective."
3,Tough workout made tougher by lack of instructions,"I was excited to try this workout because I usually love Firm DVDs. I exercise at least five times a week, usually with a blend of cardio and weights. This workout seemed to fit that bill perfectly. Five minutes into the workout, I was excited by my increased heart rate, and I thought it would be a great addition to my schedule.Unfortunately, the instructor's lack of direction quickly frustrated me. She would give a two-word cue, then begin the move without any instruction in form or execution. By the half-way point, my feet were tangled up, and my heart rate was rising only in frustration. Maybe if I were more familiar with step aerobics terms, I would've done better, but this style of workout just isn't for me. Looks like a trade-in is coming soon."
1,Disappointing & waste of money!,"I don't consider myself a beginner, but if you have never watched a video with this trainer before, you WILL be lost! I gave up on it less than 10 minutes in, b/c the directions were horrible. She calls out moves without explaining as if you already know what they are, and does things so fast, you have to keep rewinding the video. By the time you've figured out her pattern, she's already into the next move. And that's not exactly what i call a workout. My idea of a great workout dvd is something that anyone could do, never having to feel out of synch w/ the trainer, and still see results. Luckily, I got my refund!"
2,While you might burn 500 calories......,"This workout is insane.I've done plenty of work outs (my personal favs. being those of Jillian Michaels.), but this one is poorly cued. Most instructors at least give some explaination to each move. This isn't the case with this workout. I was missing a lot of moves because I didn't know what the heck to expect. The instructor pretty much just yells the name of the move out and they do it VERY fast.You would seriously have to watch this video at least 4 times (if not more) to get a concept of the video so when you actually do it you are getting a work out and not just staggering trying to keep up without having proper form.On that note, if you can't keep up with the ladies of the video then it's doubtful you'll burn 500 calories. If you can, then you may...but otherwise...No.Would be a great workout if it wasn't so poorly cued. Also if you aren't an avid exerciser you will more then likely get injured if you are not careful."
1,"Fun game, enjoyed alot, but copy protection is an F-","Quite a bit like HoMM3 with graphical and skill improvements. The feel of the game is alright, and while not quite as enjoyable as No. 3 its still very entertaining. Unlike most people I enjoyed No. 4, but this is still a good version of HoMM that you will probably enjoy if you liked the previous titled.The reason I give it 1 star overall is the copy protection. I own the box version of this game. 3/4 of the time I stick it in the drive it asks me to insert the regular disk and not the back up. I absolutely HATE this crap - like that stardock garbage from a few years ago. UBISOFT - if your idiot programmers can't come up with some better version of copy protection then you should stop making games."
1,Heroes V,"The game is great, but if you have a windows xp other than 2000 (which I do Windows xp 2002 home edition) one cannot save any games. This is awful, not being able to ever save. REALLY BAD"
2,Heroes of might and magic V,"I've played all the HMM games and was really looking forward to this one too. I was extreamly disappointed with it. I did not like the new graphics, they seemed too cartoony to me. They did away with caravans which I enjoyed in HMM4. I enjoy playing the side quests more than I enjoy the Main quests and HMM5 didn't have very many of them. An OK game but not worth $49.99. If you're a HMM fan - wait for the price to go down."
1,So not ready for prime time,"Really liked the pc HMM3 version so was delighted to see an iPad app, but this totally sucks. Difficult controls, can't get heros into the castles, crashes every other turn and displays upside down. Save your money."
2,Unplayable,"This is a great game, but lag/slow jerkiness makes it essentially unplayable--and I have WELL above the minimum requirements in regard to my system."
1,Don't Waste money.,"It's heroes trying to be world of warcraft.I lost all faith in this series due to this bloody product.I beg of you, don't buy this, don't contribute to disappointment in this world!"
3,no no no NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have never been so angry!!!!!!!It is easy to see that this game has lost its former owners, because the people who have made number 5 has no idea waht they were doing.The story is one big questionmark, and the more you play the more confused you get.There is nothing that tells you where you are, or what happanded afther the last gamen and the rockening.where is Emilia or Halfdeath?There is no clue.The graphic and the creatures look great, but the people who developed this game have totaly forgotten about game-play."
1,don't buy if u need maps for mexico - has 2 pages out of 130.,don't buy if u need maps for mexico - has 2 pages out of 130.

2,Spanish review,"It is in need of a spelling review.Spelling mistakes are found quite often, altough it is reedable.Also, the footnotes found at the end of the chapter should include, at their begining, the word they are describing. It would prevent one to be in need of searching for the words.Thank you :)"
4,THE ONE SONG (FOUND ON THIS ALBUM) THAT PUT B.B. KING BACK ON THE MAP!,"Thanks to the Billboard #3 Hit Single: ""The Thrill Is Gone"" (Which has taken B.B. King around the world, and back again!). This Album also included another Billboard Top 20 Hit Single ""So Excited"" that was a favorite in the R&B/Soul Market. Although the other tracks were decent Blues/Rock/Pop flavored tracks Bluesway/ABC was quicky grooming B.B. for a whole new market with future releases and from that point on B.B. has NEVER looked back and has made it to his 7th decade...WOW!!!"
3,Didn't work for me...,I'm a fan of B.B. King's work and have plenty of his albums. This one simply did not measure up for me. I give it three stars mostly because I am a fan. I would suggest instead getting either Live at the Regal or Live at Cook County Jail. There was a CD available with both on it but I think it may be out of print.
5,Excellent condition,Very pleased. Book in excellent condition. Prompt delivery. Thank you. Would definately purchase from seller again.
4,nice starter bike!,"I bought this for my wife, and it's her first bike.the FREE shipment arrived within 5 days in a big box. Assembly is quite easy, done in less than 30 minutes, not bad for the first time.For the price I paid it beat the dept store bike.She said it rides better than the Trek that we had when we were at the resort."
3,Heavier than my expectation...,"Overall printed status, pictures were perfect. But, for children's book, it was somewhat heavy to carry every sunday..."
5,Perfect for normal/dry skin.,"I love this cream. It makes my face glow. Perfect face cream for normal/dry skin. The glycolic in this cream is not too strong, but strong enough to help with exfoliation. It is a must have for dull looking skin."
1,Not effective,I tried this brand after Glytone reformulated their products. Glycolic concentration in the Facial Cream II is not strong enough to make a difference.
4,Not Your Typical Football Flick,"Very effective film of the sports world. Nolte is terrific, even if the romance is a little cliche and unbelievable. Very talky, and not much action on the field, but gives an excellent counterbalance to the usual ""feel good"" sports films I've grown tired of.DvD picture is superb. Audio starts a bit shaky (with music and background noise overpowering dialouge) but eventually evens out."
4,classic,"the grimy side of the NFL back in the day... Those guys were a different breed... If you love football, you must see this."
5,One of best blues CDs of All Time,"B.B.'s best and maybe the best ever. This CD never gets old. Can't believe someone reviewed this and said ""overrated""?! Wow."
2,informitive but QBASIC is no longer in Windows 98,This book is very informitive in nature but it based everything in it's contents to QBASIC. QBASIC is no longer in Microsoft Windows 98. So if you are running 98 do not get this book; unless you have no idea what you computer is than it is a very informitive book.
1,Please don't buy for serious play.,"This is a toy. Period. It can be fun for a student to play with who is not serious, but is not playable as an instrument for someone who really wants to learn. It is not fitting properly and will never play right. The bridge and pegs are not carved for each particular instrument, and they need to be. You will have to keep twisting hte pegs so hard eventually you will either crack the peg box or make the peg holes too large.If you are considering playing, or having your child play, rent an instrument from a reputable shop or have a trained strings teacher help you shop for an instrument at a fair price. I am an orchestra teacher and students who come in with these factory line painted violins almost always end up quitting because of the extremely low quality of their instrument (and most end up falling apart)."
3,not bad,"This product had some advantages, but keep in mind it is not a high quality instrument. I bought one to see how interested my daughter was in playing and once she progressed half way through the year it became apparent this instrument would not keep up. It required constant tuning, and when I went have the pegs replaced, I found it would cost more then the violins worth. To get started it would be fine, but if you are serious about playing by a serious instrument."
1,Horrible Condition,"I recieved my violin today for my daughter. I read the reviews on this product and I was really in the middle. Well after recieving a broken violin today I am convinced that I should have gone done to the local music store and rented one. It was horrible, light wieght - yeah like 8 oz, not 8 lbs. I think that is why it showed up broken. The strings will not stay tight, the neck was broken, the chin rest was broken and the back had a long split. I was horrified. I buy a lot online and this is the first time I have felt I was taken. I am trying to return the product now."
3,Student violin,"I bought this violin to maybe dabble a bit in it as a student but, please be aware that this is a student violin in the sense that it is for little arms, little hands and little chins.Otherwise it sounds pretty good. I had no problem tuning it. The hardest part was getting the string ends through the tuning pegs. The bridge is not steep enough but anyone can make a new one out of balsa wood. Although the pegs are not geared, they seem to hold well by friction.The bow is better than I expected.All in all you get what you pay for and it is worth the fifty bucks, but not any more."
2,you get what you pay for,i bought this vioilin because i wanted somthing I could beat up when I was learning. Within the first 5 mins of having it 2 strings popped when I was tuning it and my bow arrived broken! i had my friend look at it an said it must have broken in shipping and that the strings were very cheap but not to expect too much becuase of how much i paid for it. I rated a 2 because of the first impression of the condition it arrived in and the strings being so cheap. Also they didn't even include instructions on how to set up the bridge. If I hadn't known how I would have been very frustrated.
3,a lot of hassle,"Don't get me wrong I was expecting cheap but there were some things that were a little much. First, the violin does not come with the protective cloth. Second, The back of the neck is NOT finished. And third, you may get a dowel rod rattling inside the body of the violin.The hassle part was having to return the violin twice. The first time was with the first 2 problems mentioned above but it was a question to the company if it was supposed to be like that. The second violin had all three problems with it and I learned that the company uses an automated system to send you there apologies and delivery forms to replace your violin. This was very frustrating because the violins that was sent never had any fix with them. They never really took the time to figure out what was my problem.Other than that, the violin does play rather nicely for a cheap violin."
4,From where I stand.,"This violin is a decent violin I have not played that many and am learning and it is as good of any other, though I am a guitarist foremost; but it has good resonance and and was not that hard to put together the only problem I had was tuning it because of my novice I assume so yea. So if you are a beginner then this should be a good violin."
3,POS,"I cant get the thing to make a sound Ive spent three and a half hours tuning, applying rosin, and tensioning the bow, and the thing will barely whine at all. Ive also watched mutiple videos on bow technique to make sure I dont just suck at playing the violin"
1,Misleading,"The product advertisers as a ""student"" violin, it is a toy. It is completely incapable of staying tuned. My daughter has played for 3 years & we wanted something to use as we travel vs. her classic violin. This is strictly a novelty item & not for someone serious about learning. That being said, my daughter does love the soft sided case for short travel."
1,Just a toy,"It's not a god violin for a binger! When I was trying to put rosin on the bow, the bow broke into two pieces!!"
1,what inlay,"Violin is not what they say it is. There is no inlay around the edges, and the top and bottom are heavy for a violin. A bestler at it's best!"
3,Strings,"I received this product in a decent amount of time and it included everything it showed on the description. When I opened the box, the violin strings were not all attached how they were supposed to be. Otherwise, it was a decent deal."
3,Ok book.. Good be better,I think that Liz like someone else said is oh-so-very pathetic.. Yes she is level headed and everything BUT she needs to quit hanging on to Todd like he's some saint or something. Todd had to come back and destroy a wonderful friendship that was blooming. Personally I think at least in SVU it would be really cool if she gets back with Jeffrey. Because she even dropped TOM!!! Thank you for Reading.
2,She Power,"This book is about a girl who dresses up as a boy and has to delievers a secret to Americans. The little girl gets on the wrong ship and Guess What, it is full of BRITISH SOLDIERS! She gets scared and doesnt know what to do."
5,Toliver's Secret - Historical Fiction With a Good Lesson,"I used this novel to teach a summer reading class for fourth and fifth grade students. Our theme was the American Revolution. Toliver's Secret is about a timid girl who is asked to help the Patriots by delivering a secret message, hidden in a loaf of bread, to a courier. As the simple plan becomes complicated, she learns to be more self-confident and to believe in herself. Even though the story is set in the past, young readers can relate to her emotions in a timeless manner. I would use this book again to enhance discussion about the American Revolution and to learn about the importance of overcoming fears that get in the way of accomplishments."
5,Great Historical Fiction for Kids!,"This book was a perfect novel to illustrate the perils of war, and the American Revolution for my fifth grade class. I used it as the middle level novel for my American Revolution literature circles. It worked extremely well, and I felt my average readers got as much out of our studies as my advanced readers who were able to read a more challenging novel. I highly recommend this book."
3,Predictable,"I love Sister Carol O'Marie's characters and her books. This again is a good book with warm characters, but it was so predictable. I could easily turn back to the appropriate page and see where and when and how the person had the opportunity to do the murder. It was all too obvious. And an enclosed murder is rather old-time. I found this one boring, though I would read another of O'Marie's books anytime. She needed to work a better plot."
1,Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 ( Surround Records),Beware ! This clunker lacks much sonically. As far as I able to discern there is NO piano ! The entire thing seems to be produced by a synthesizer and there seems to be signal compression.Don't waste your money and avoid other products by the charlatan who did this.
3,pollyanna,"I was disapointed with the book because I had to do a review on it for college, but there was no information about the author, the publisher, and when/where the book was published. Otherwise the print was clear and easy to read."
3,movie is better,Usually the book is much better than the movie. That is not the case with the story in this book.
5,Inspector Lynley and Havers' first case together,"I just read this first of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley mysteries in order to compare it to the BBC television version, which was shown in the US on PBS's ""Mystery."" It is more complex than the movie, even though the movie was allotted 2 90-min. episodes instead of one. Also, it is a more harrowing experience than the movie, which considerably softened the story for tv. George's writing is top-notch. I found the scenarios hard to digest, emotionally, even though I thought I knew what was coming, more or less. Despite the difficult motivation for the crime(s), I am already into the series' next book, without my vision being colored by the companion tv movie. That can wait."
4,Great Series- some books alittle gruesome/hard to read,"This was one of my book-club books. I really love the detective characters! I think that if you are a classic mystery lover you will love these books. They are as addictive as ""Law and Order""! My only problem was this book, and some of the others in the series ,have crimes that involve children. I personally find those hard to read, just like I can't watch a lot of the ""SVU"" Law and Orders-- I like the ""who-done-it"" aspects and everything else is prefect about these. I know the bad guy will get caught in the end... but it's still hard to take some of the more gruesome scenes/crimes."
2,Not that so great,"I am a huge fan of mystery novels and this book was my first Elizabeth George novel. I was extremely let down. I thought the pace of the book was extremely slow and the plot was too simplified. Granted, there is a nice twist at the end, but thats it. I also thought one of the main characters, Barbara, was annoying and stereotypical. I know there are a lot of people who love this series, so maybe it gets much better. However, I would not start with the first one."
2,"Chips OK, Case Sub-Par, Not Good Value For Your Money","As others have mentioned, the chips that arrived are good quality for the price-per-chip (<$100).The fact that I have to drive home is the sheer weight of the chips + case. The case becomes VERY heavy with the chips inside it, and its large square size makes it awkward to carry in any other way other than by the handle.Therefore, to me the handle is a key feature that lamentably cannot be trivialized as suggested by other fellow reviewers.It was the primary reason why I returned the set.A secondary reason is that the price is not exactly a ""bargain"". After going to a local sporting store, I found a 500-chip set for less than half the price of this set - and that one included dealer buttons and 2 card sets. So I bought 2 of them. Yes I now have to haul 2 cases, but they're infinitely sturdier and saved good money by buying a set with dealer buttons and cards already included."
3,so-so,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. I have just sent it back. Here are his complaints. It is not thick enough, hence warm enough, he thinks. The fabric is not a ""slippery"" nylon, so it doesn't slide on and off as easily as his old vest. It is cut somewhat wide across the chest so it sort of binds his arms in front. The vest LOOKS good, and appears to be well made. It may actually be warmer than he expected. He didn't ever wear it, he only tried it on."
1,waste of money,"The Easter Bunny brought this plane for our son. We charged it up, took it outside. After it's 4th flight, the propeller nut came off followed by the propeller. It crashed. Took a small chunk out of the wing. Remarkably we found the propeller and nut. Put it back on. Tightened it and the other one. Next flight the opposite nut and thus propeller came off. Crash. Nut and propeller gone. DOES NOT COME WITH SPARE NUTS. 5 flights (about 10 minutes of play) was NOT worth the money.Oh, but if you call the company they're sell you a set for only $5 after shipping."
1,Skywinder did not work,"We put the skywinder together, put batteries in, but only the tail control surface would move occasionally when given a command from the controller. We took it back to the store"
5,"Durable, Fast, and agressive.","I was skeptical with this toy, at first I thought it would be like many of the toy planes out there, slow response, and less flight time. I was actually surprised when I had purchased this item. This plane flew very fast, responded to controls quickly. It is fun to fly out in an open field. Only con is, it take alot of practice to control this plane."
4,"bad luck,and it only gets worse","i like murphy's law.it'a a fast paced movie from the 80's.framed for murder on top of having a crazy woman trying to kill him maybe a lot to handle,but add a rebellious teenager and jack's troubles have just began.i love this movie."
5,The Best-Ever Book on the MUSIC known as Southern Rock!,"Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down, it's that simple... and it's that great! The author, Marley Brant, has interviewed a veritable Who's Who of Southern Rock and asked all the right questions. Their personal recollections and musical opinions are interwoven with a finely tuned chronological flow. The triumphs and pitfalls, the real people and their human experiences are all there for the reader, both fan and serious music student. While I am a fan of all music, especially Southern Rock, without a doubt this is the most important and insightful music book I have read to date!!"
1,Strap problems,Strap broke and is practically impossible to replace. Strap is not a standard replacement and it is almost impossible to find a replacement that will fit. Save yourself some trouble and find a watch with a standard band.
1,DON'T BUY CASIO!!!,"I bought this watch on October 17, 2009. The case broke on June 16, 2010. I took it to where I bought it and they said that since it was the casing that broke I had to contact Casio. I contacted Casio and they said to send it to them AT MY EXPENSE and they would let me know if the repair would be covered under the warranty. Well, you guessed it, it wasn't covered. Can you believe that? 9 months and they wouldn't repair it! Casio said that they don't cover the case under warranty. Well, gee, what is a wrist watch without the case? I will NEVER buy another Casio watch again."
5,A treat,CD arrived in excellent condition and George Strait is THE performer. period. Love his music and especially the not so new titles
2,Adequate,The product is exactly as described but I found that I preferred a small loop & hook carpet mat that I could also throw into the wash machine. I found that the carpet absorbed the water and made it easier for my older dog to stand.
2,Disappointed,"I have only been using Zenmed for two weeks and although the zenmed website says results can be seen after the first use, i have yet to see any results. I didnt break out or have anything worse but i havent seen a difference, my skin is exactly the same. Its like i didnt even buy these products for $65 -.- Can someone who has gotten results explain how to uae it correctly please?Overall, i would say dont spend sixty bucks on this, not worth it"
5,Best Results So Far,"I took a chance at this product after using a few others (used mederma, dermatix, and got ok results), but with the zenmed kit I noticed significant improvement after the first week of using it. Glad I tried this stuff!! Great results so far, i am very pleased."
2,did not work for me,"I am a Latin woman with olive skin, I had a severe acne breakout that left me with dark brown scars on both cheeks, this did nothing for me, very disappointing to pay good money and get no results. The Maxi-peel exfoliant worked miracles for me and is a lot cheaper"
1,WORTHLESS,"Inexpensive, but worthless. I purchased three 25-disc packages and more than 75% of the discs were defective. When held under bright light, dimples and, in some instances, even scratches, were visible on the recording surface. I replaced these with Panasonic DVD-R discs and the difference in quality is amazing. No more Ridata discs for me."
4,"good keyboard, great heat","My partner uses this with a heated mouse and wrist-pad, and the combination has nearly made his normally bone-chilling hands almost warm. He likes it and has had it for a week, I hope they are more reliable than other reviews have suggested, time will tell. For now, his hands are warm and he stays in a better mood."
5,great album,"grew up listening to her and she is awesome, one album definately worth buying for her fans to check out"
4,Helps with KP,"I have had keratosis pilaris all my life, and using this lotion for a month daily has reduced my KP by about 50%. I don't think it will get better than that, but it's something! Don't use this on super sensitive skin like the face, but otherwise this moisturizes skin pretty well."
2,AmLactin Lotion Review,I got AmLactin Lotion because I have a skin condition where I get little bumps and red patches on my upper arms and thighs. It does a great job moisturizing these areas and leaves skin feeling great and smooth. However one big downside is it has a pretty strong scent and it's not a flowery smell...
4,So far So good,"My esthetician recommended this for me to deal with an acne-like condition on my arms. I've been using it for a couple of months and it gets the job done. It also has helped slightly with stretch marks. I notice if I use it a lot it softens my skin, but I have to be regular which would take a lot of the product (like everyday after a shower) and since this product is expensive I don't use it as much as I would a regular body lotion. I am acne prone and can only use this product on my arms and places I don't get acne. Not on face, back or chest. Still good product for the $ and my arm skin is smooth. This stuff does what coco butter should. One downside is the weird amonia smell but it goes away pretty quickly."
3,Terrible smell!,"I have KP, and after using this lotion for just a week, I am starting to see some small improvement. It does sting a bit upon application, but not terribly, and just for a second. The real draw-back is the SMELL. It's very mediciney, which I suppose is to be expected from a medicated lotion, but it is pretty bad. It's bad enough that I won't use it twice a day -- if I use it in the morning, the lingering smell throughout the day drives me crazy. I only use it at night, so I am only getting a partial effect. It's the best I've found so far for the bumps, though, so I will put up with it until I can find something else."
3,Beautiful but annoying,"First off let me say that I've played and loved all the Myst games, including URU. That being said, Path of the Shell was just to odd to be enjoyable. If you play this game plan to spend a lot of time linking, counting lines in books, waiting, linking, waiting, counting lines in books, etc. None of this adds to the game play or the experience. I really don't think it is possible to finish the game without looking at hint or a walkthrough, unless you have an extremely high end gaming machine and a whole lot of free time. My recommendation: Buy it for the experience, but be prepared to consult a good walkthrough or be eternally frustrated."
2,Fun but Overly Difficult,"It's tough to pick on the Myst team(s) for making a game that is too difficult...that's always been the appeal of Myst to me. However, the main puzzles in this game, while fun to play, are not likely solvable by most logic-puzzle gamers. The solutions are not very intuitive, and there are often few if any clues leading to the solution. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that you need to be patient...VERY patient...not just with yourself but with the puzzles themselves (i.e., be prepared to do nothing at times). I don';t know how I could have gotten through this game without looking at a walkthrough for at least 4 of the key puzzle solutions. A mediocre effort by UbiSoft. Hopefully, Myst IV will be better."
4,Of course better than the movie,I read this book years ago and was actually disappointed when I got to see the movie. I found the movie somewhat lacking because they don't fill you in where the psychic comes from (the book does) and so much more.The only thing I did not like about the book was the ending seemed like a sequel was on the way. I would rather it just ended.
1,Do Not buy or read this book!,"Any serious dresser or gentleman would know that the author of this book knows absolutely nothing about fine mens' dressing. Within the pages of this book you will discover why so many men do not know how to dress... because we have people like this author writing books about fashion. If you are serious about looking good, go buy Alan Flusser's 'Style and the Man.'"
3,Bought 2 HP LaserJet 2100 printers,"One of the two printers wouldn't feed more than 1 page out of the paper tray without jamming. It is sitting on the floor in my office. The other printer is just okay, nothing special."
4,While you were sleeping,Cash Money and Marvelous were a dynamic duo that were the victims of poor marketing and timing. Marvelous has a flow that is a cross between early L.L. Cool J and The Fresh Prince. Marvelous has a great flow and D.J. Cash Money was one of the best of late 80s. It is unfortunate that most mainstream rap fans will remember Parents Just Don't Understand over ugly people be quiet. If you were sleep when these guys were making noise know that they need to be heard.
4,WELL WORTH THE WAIT,"This CD is the true essence of HIP-HOP. I have been looking for this CD forever. Now that I have found it, It's on!"
4,Scholarly Research Anyone ?,"This is an excellent book, which should not be undertaken for an entertaining read. It is detail to the extreme, and I am sure it has value as a reference. However, do not expect to be entertained unless you are an extreme WWII buff."
3,unremarkable stories by the remarkable Highsmith...,"'Mermaids on the Golf Course' is a disparate collection of stories which really lack the notable elements found in Patricia Highsmith's novels, ... particularly suspense and psychological deconstruction of central characters. These short stories are mostly mild character studies of lonely people. However the key short story, entitled 'Mermaids on the Golf Course', is rather clever and bizarre. Not a classic, but certainly memorable.Bottom line: a collection of uninspired stories. Not recommended."
2,Way off their best,"Don't judge the Doughboys by this album- their last. It does have a few decent songs on it, but way too many drift into Goo Goo Dolls style mediocre college rock. The energy and originality of previous albums is sorely lacking and it's probably a good thing they broke up when they did. Yes, it's got fantastic production and probably worth a listen for completists, just don't pay too much."
1,wee wee pads,"These pads are ultra-thin and if you have a dog larger than 10 pounds, I would not suggest these pads. The liquid spreads out and the dog's paws get all wet. Yuck."
2,"Great as Always, but LOSE THE ""DESIGNER"" SCENT!","I love jockey underwear. I've bought this brand for years, because of the great fit, the long wear, and the fact that it's 100% cotton (I love natural stuff). I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming ""baby-powder"" scent to the product (what's the point of 100% cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric?). Repeated washings have not removed the smell. I will have to dispose of the underwear. I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented. MAYBE JOCKEY CAN LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS ""SCENTED,"" OR ""UNSCENTED?"" (Regular bathing is a better alternative to ""scented"" underwear, anyway.)"
1,Shame on Jockey!!,What is it about companies thinking women want harsh chemicals embedded in their clothing?? I have worn cotton Jockey underwear for years as I wanted to wear more natural fabrics. I am furious at Jockey as the last 3 pack of underwear I purchased. They have a disgusting acrid chemical smell that does not come out in multiple washings. WHAT ARE YOU JOCKEY EXECUTIVES THINKING?? How dare you sell us chemical laden undergarments? I REFUSE to give my money to companies that treat women as idiots.
1,Poor Quality,"I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time. The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching. Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them! I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings. Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent. However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product. I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck. I will only pay sale prices."
4,Good fit,"I've been buying these for years because they fit very well, don't make panty lines or ride up. But unfortunately, they're not available in stores like they used to be. So I was glad to find them online."
4,Open box item?,"This camera was given to my sister as a gift. She indicated to me that the box had been opened, but the contents were intact and the package was complete. Seller indicated that this was an open box item. I reviewed the advertisement posted on Amazon. No ""open box"" indication was stated. It may be true that the seller's website made the open box statement. I have no way of knowing that other than the seller's statement. It would be nice if Amazon could document the status of purchased goods that are advertised on the website but available off-site. The camera appears to be working fine."
5,It is how you print that makes it last longer,"If you go into your preferences before you print and select fast/economicalprinting, this will last you alot longer.I have been using this item for years and I print several pages daily, Switchingto the fast/economical option more than doubles the life of this ink"
2,Thimble,"Another typical ink jet consumable, very small, runs out fast, and costs way too much. Just will have to wait for the 3rd party knock-off to come on the market."
1,Thar' she blows!,"In the words of the Sea Captain, ""thar' she blows!"" This game doesn't come close to rivals RCT and ZT. The inability to design rides or attractions, the inability to rotate the screen and the inability to get money fast enough are just a few of this game's flaws. It is not worth $20. It might be worth $10 when you've played all there is to play in this one."
3,"Good, but room for improvement","This game is average but definitely not the best in tycoon style games.For example not all the buildings are rotatable and there is only one fixed camera view. There is also a limit to how many workers you can employ and after about 5 days on the in-game clock your buildings start to break down a lot.However it is nice to see real rides from the parks and you can, if you have the patience, make your parks large and beautiful with the scenery and foliage which is available."
4,Different Desserts for the rest of us,"""Hawai'i's Best Local Desserts"" is a neat cookbook for desserts found in Hawaii. Jean Watanabe Hee has done a very good job of collecting, about, 125 recipes for tasty desserts. Hawaii is part of the USA; so, you should not be suprised to see some familiar recipes here. However the truly Hawaiian recipes are great!Because several other cultures have interacted with Hawaiian ways, some of the recipes show a very international appeal.Just a few of the desserts are: Coconut-Pinapple Cream Cake, Mango bread, Hawaiian Delite Cake, Fresh Mango Pie, Kona Coffe Mud Pie, and Haupia Cream Cheese Pie.Buy the book, make a new and different dessert for a party."
4,my bad,"i love this song, but i didn't pay any attention when i ordered it that it was just a single. so nothing wrong with the product itself, just me not reading it fully"
1,You have got to be kidding me,"I know they had a low budget. A low budget does not excuse this piece of junk. The other reviewer obviously worked for the production. The special effects are some of the worst computer animation and green screen work you are ever going to see. The sound quality is non existant. To call this an indee film is to insult indee films. This film could be entertaining to watch, but go into it knowing what to expect. The other review makes it sound like a decent quality independent film. It is not.This is amature movie night. Like watching an extened YouTube video."
4,excellent movie!,"An excellent movie with a talent actor, Mike Pringle. This indy flic is produced by pure talent... using some pretty cool special effects.Seems to be a several 'new' actors on the scene in this one, and despite some minor downfalls not even worth mentioning here, it still is an entertaining movie to watch.CORD COSLORCelebrity Direct EntertainmentPort Charlotte, FLwww.celebritydirect.net"
5,Magical!,"This cd would be worth having if it only featured Jeno Jando's magical performance of the Andante from Mozart's 17th piano concerto. It is really special! I have heard many of Mozart's piano concertos but the minute I heard this one it became one of my personal favorites. Jando's eloquent playing makes this affordable disc a welcome addition to any classical music lover's collection. With Naxos, you really can't go wrong."
2,Mermaid Doll,"This product shipped fast. I think it is worth what the cost is. But don't have high expectations for it. My daughter is 10 1/2 and she was very frustrated trying to do this project. I had to help her a lot. Among other small problems, it comes with two sided tape strips to tape things together, but even with my natural long nails, I had a terrible time trying to separate the backing from the tape. I'm not upset, because it didn't cost much. But, I wouldn't buy it again for any of my other daughters."
4,Good Book to Start Learning,"This is a great book to start the process of learning to control your own brain!Easy to read and apply!! Get it today! Dr. William Horton, Psychologist and Author of Primary Objective, NLP and Guerrilla Warfare."
1,Dishonest!!!!,"The publishers of this CD are being blatantly DISHONEST. The CD claims to be the AUDIO Unlimited Power and even includes a statement about it being narrated by Anthony Robbins.Yet the CD is NOT AN AUDIO VERSION OF THE BOOK. It is simply a recording of Mr Robbins presenting 50 minutes of material at a seminar.Only in small letters at the back of the CD does it say ""abridged version"".Avoid the CD. Just buy and read the book."
3,Some Glimmers,"I did take something useful out of this book. Basically, it heightened my awareness about how to communicte effectively with different personality types. Not that this is something particularly new--I doubt there is anything new in the book--but I found it useful to present information differently to introvert and extrovert types, and I also practice occasional ""mirroring"". The advice on diet, however, is in my opinion, flawed. This book will not change your life, but it is an easy, and sometimes informative read, even if most proposed solutions are manifestly too facile to be true."
3,Great starter CD,"I put this in every once in awhile into my car when I feel down or feel that I need some dirrection in my life...sometimes Tony needs to remind us what life is really all about and how to have the best life, this is a great starter CD for anyone being introduced to Tony for the first time, but also I got ""live with passion"" in which I think is better and everyone should listen to that one, because it has so much good things in it that even listening to it over and over again you can miss things here and there, I love all of Tony Robbins teachings and just hearing his voice relaxes me :-)."
2,A disappointment,"I bought (or got) this book 'cause I've always liked spy stories (I'm a John LeCarre man myself)and I had some expectations of a ""show and tell"" book by a former head of the Mossad. I also had some respect, as a citizen consumer of the news, of this official who had,somehow, something more European and dignified than the ""average"" Israeli macho security hero. Halevy was also Israel's ambassador to Jordan and very instrumental in brokering the peace agreement with Jordan.I found the book rather tiresome with a great deal of muted self-glorification and almost no revelations or juicy bits. Halevy comes across as a very loyal and careful technocrat with clear views (which I don't subscribe to) about the ""War on Terror"" being the central stuggle of our times."
3,You will love it... if you are an IBM fanatic,"no, no.What they never said is that almost all the examples are with ibm applets and applications: with comp.ibm.xml.parser, using ibm websphere, ibm visual age for java, etc.It is ok to have a idea of the use of both worlds, but i don't expected to read ""with your ibm solution...""i.e. buy this book, buy ibm.--Lo que nunca dicen es que casi todos los ejemplos son usando ibm aplicaciones y applets: comp.ibm.xml.parser, usando ibm websphere y editando con ibm visual age for java, etc.Esta bueno para darse una idea de como interactuan ambos mundos.. solo que no esperaba oir un ""con su soluci-n ibm...""e.d. compre este libro, compre ibm"
4,Decent book,"A bit old now that 3 internet years are gone. Otherwise deserve a five star.Yes, it's a bit old. Yes, it primarily covers xml4j and VisualAge. And yes, it assume some previous xml knowledge. But it is clean, readable and no-nonsense. If you are already familiar with XML and Java on their own but are looking for a book to really help start Java-XML. This is the book for you. Flip through the ~300 pages (others are appendice) and you are there!BTW, xml4j and the more popular Apache xerces are pretty much the same."
1,Wrong description on this website-bowl is much smaller!,"The website description in the caption is ""6 cup, 6 1/2 inches deep."" It is only 3 1/4 inches deep, but 6 1/2 inches wide, and holds only 4 cups, not 6 (I measured). The follow-up paragraph in the website gives the correct measurements in inches, but still incorrectly states 6 cups. I returned this item once, explaining all this (the box is mislabeled, maybe directly from the manufacturer). They sent me the same item all over again, and I have to return it again."
5,i hate romance novels...,"...but this book changed my mind. I read Ms. Foster's mainstream novel and decided to give this category romance a try. Now I'm hooked.It's sexy, it's fun and the characters are people I really got excited about. I'm going to buy Ms. Foster's other books as soon as I can get my hands on them."
3,not the same..,I just saw Asia live and he is amazing. 11 synths..and a computer and he jumped back and forth usually playing two at once...When I saw this cd I thought..ooh how cool.But The Final Countdown sounds like a MIDI file I downloaded and played back through my keyboard. He should have left out the cheesy drum machine and kept it piano strings and analog synths.
3,This Wager was Boring,"It was nice to continue the saga of the friends and family from Dark Wager, only Lord Rexley, Jack could have been a bit more romantic, especially after meeting the rogue he was portrayed as in the prevous novel. He was quite a lusty soul in the previous novel and seemed much too tame even for Gwendolyn.The lightheartedness of Bella and Wulf's story helped to make this more enjoyable, but the secret of Jack's parentage was no big surprise.I agree with the other reviews that there could have been a bit more sensuality introduced in the love scenes. I tended to grow a bit bored with the non-action of this book."
2,"I wanted to like this one, but...","I've yet to read anything by Garth Ennis other than Preacher that I liked very much, and this one was no exception. This might have made a pretty good one-shot comic book, but the rather thin premise is barely enough to sustain a short six-issue series. It's occasionally pretty funny, and I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it did make me laugh a few times, but otherwise, it seemed to me that there just wasn't much else there. A lot of the gags are very repetitive, and I got tired of the running gag about the rather limited vocabulary of the Rifle Brigade pretty quickly. I can accept that this is a comedy and not anything resembling a serious war comic, but I didn't think it delivered in that department.Fans of Garth Ennis may like this book, but people who mainly know him as the writer of Preacher (which even had a better Nazi villainess!) might be disappointed."
3,JUDAS AND SIMON SAVE THE SHOW...ALMOST.,"First off, the original jesus in this show was IAN GILLAN not Ted Neally.Take JUDAS & SIMON from the film and place them in the original london cast and there you have the best JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.However these two from the film don't make this one worth buying."
2,Not the best version of Superstar,"The roles of Jesus and Judas on this album are played by the Broadway UNDERSTUDIES. Ben Vereen added Motown soul and original interpretation to the role of Judas, while here Carl Anderson provides a second-best performance. Ted Neeley sings in a manner that will either make you love him or hate him. The dramatic pauses in his singing may have worked well with visuals, but do not make for extraordinarily fluid listening.Also, the sound quality of this album is some of the worst I've ever heard. Sadly, the original Broadway cast soundtrack is available only in Japan, so the best available version of Superstar to buy is the 1970 original concept.This was the fourth Jesus Christ Superstar album to be released, following the original concept album (Gillan/Head 1970), the original Broadway cast (Fenholt/Vereen 1971), and the original London cast (Nicholas/? 1972)."
3,Jesus Christ's Superstar soundtrack,"This soundtrack continues to hold timeless appeal combining the live energy of a classical symphony with mid 70's classic rock. A wonderful marriage of theatrical vocals with powerful arrangements, as the songs segue into each other just like stage performance. Stand-out vocals goto both Ted Neeley as Jesus and Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene. The scope of sound/texture is wonderfully diverse, shifting from structured vocal parts, and conventional songs to awe-inspiring orchestral pieces. Symphonic and grandiose as it is delicate and tender, spiritual and inspiring as it is fiery and contemporary. 'The Jesus Christ Superstar' soundtrack is such a pleasing listen, charismatic vocals, orchestral power, 70's rock groove, and showtune flamboyance. It's not so much a 'stage to silver screen' adaptation as it is a brilliant well-produced soundtrack."
5,Great chocolate with a kick,"I was searching online for a valentines gift for the guy I'm seeing. I did a search for liquor filled chocolates thinking that'd be a good idea and when I read the previous reviews on this item, I had to try it. So I bought me a box, one for the guy, one for my momma, and one for a girlfriend. I love them and they make great gifts... delish!"
1,Doesn't even start,"Game looked fun. It doesn't even start after installing the patches! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! This is so not cool. I buy the game, wait for it to be shipped, and then it doesn't even work. Ubistupid should be ashamed!"
1,Thanks Ubisoft! A true piece of junk!!!,"Seriously, I tried to play this trash and now I am struggling in the street fight because every time I died, I cannot quick load my game.Besides that, this game is so damn buggy in every level and detail that it really hurt the Splinter Cell Series, and the graphic actually looks dated. After all, I just want to say one thing to Ubisoft: ""F YOU for screwing my experience with Sam Fisher."""
1,Not as good as other Splinter Cells,"The problem with this game is that UBIsoft forgot what made Splinter cell so fun. Namely, you had two dissimilar teams (a spy and a mercenary). Each team had strengths and weaknesses. Double Agent took all that away.This game is no better than a shoot em up game. There is no strategy involved anymore. UBIsoft should have just taken their earlier offering ""Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory"" and done some minor tweeks, like making a 8 person multiplayer (vs the current 4).I returned Double Agent a week after I bought it. Don't waste your time on Double Agent. If you want a shoot em up game, get Rainbow 6, or Call of Duty. If you want a great stealthy, strategy game, buy Chaos Theory. Be careful though, Chaos Theory does not work on newer XBox360"
1,Terrible Bike!!!,"I purchased this bike for my wife from fogdog through amazon. I must say the service was excellent.I did have to return the bike because it is very poorly designed. The bike's frame was so short that the pedals would hit the front tire and you could get hurt riding it. In addition to the terrible design, it took me an entire day to get the brakes and wheels adjusted properly. The wheels were way out of true and the brakes would not align properly at all. I finally got it to an acceptable point with the wheels and brakes when we realized the pedals hit the tire.The bike seems to have the mongoose name, while the manual said Pacific. That leads me to believe it's not a true mongoose. The mongoose name and the other review led me to believe it was ok to purchase.In closing, service was great and the bike was horrible."
5,Why can't more music be this good,"I have to be honest, music does not get much better than what is found on this CD. The album is real and hard driving. I can let it play straight through, which true music fans (not just country fans) know is rare. Gary Allan and his band put on a great live show. Finally, a new artist is original, interesting and good. If you are sick of all the junk out there, give yourself a break and buy this CD."
1,NOT SO GREAT,Compared to Men of War this game is a joke. There is very little detail. The graphics are dated. I'm sorry I bought it.
1,HARDEST pillow I have ever seen!!,"NOT A GOOD PILLOW! If you want a VERY HARD pillow with a very odd shape, this pillow is for you. But the pillow is so hard that I find it unbelievable that anyone could sleep on it at all. Plus, if you sleep on your side, you are instructed to sleep only on the narrow end, which requires you to balance your head on it, or your head either falls off the pillow, or falls into the depression in the center of the pillow. Since you have to stay awake (not that I was getting any sleep!)to manage this balancing feat, it defeats the purpose of a pillow. And most of the pillow is wasted if you have to sleep on one narrow part. Ugh. Obviously, the pillow is a good fit for someone. (previous review.) Definitely NOT for ME! Be aware of the characteristics of this pillow before you risk purchasing it!"
1,Lots of scriptures Hung by the tounge,I was curious because of the title. It was not what I expected.Too much religious and scripture references I was not looking for.
3,SPEEDLITE,I love the Speedlite. The Tripod is REALLY CHEAP. The Batteries are still working. Everything else is a waste.
4,One of the best mystery plots I've read!,"The author has done a fine job of creating an interesting and believable plot that keeps you wondering ""who dun it."" I could identify with the main character and care what happened to her and other believable characters in the book.I have read many of the books written by this author and this is my favorite."
2,How to Hear from God Study Guide,"In doing this study I have found that my answers do not correlate with her answers in the back of the book. Joyce Meyers' goes over my head on some of her answers. Basicaly my answers are similar to hers, but their are a few that I don't have a clue where she got heranswers."
4,Calphalon 12 Cup Muffin Pan Silicone Bakeware,Purchased for my sister. She loves the silicone bakeware and has a lot of it now. She got rid of a lot of her regular stuff.
2,Fables from Aesop Bachman.,"This book is notable for what was left out. It doesn't delve into why the current version of BTO will not play with him, or why Burton Cummings affixed the ""Aesop Bachman"" moniker to him. All in all, the Randy Bachman story is that of a tremendously talented man who was as ruthless business-wise as he was talented musically. Some things are more important than money and power, namely family, which is one lesson this man has apparently never learned. Save your money."
1,Horrible product. DId not work,This really did not do anythign for my pimples. My pimples just stayed the same. Also this item so TOOO expensive for it not to work.
3,Hit and Miss,"Both my sister in law and wife got these as gifts and their opinons were very similar. If you got the pimple at just the right time you had some success and it sped up the healing process, other times it just was a waste. The price would suggest a better than 50% success rate and for that reason I would stay away from the Zeno Acne."
1,SHOULD BE CALLED ZERO CLEARING,"Used this for over three weeks on cystic adult acne with NO - absolutely NO - improvement - got my money back, of course -Buy the ANSR Beam instead - that is a product that works!"
2,Not worth the money,"I read all the reviews about the Zeno and was very excited to get it. It did seem to make my pimples go away faster at first. After my second cartridge, it didn't seem to work as good. My skin didn't look any better. I have pale skin and it left red marks that would eventually fade after about an hour. It takes a while to treat a couple of pimples so it wasn't easy to do in the morning when you have a hectic schedule. It does nothing to prevent new pimples either. Basically it is a very expensive, ok spot treatment. [...]"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Thank God for a money back guarantee! I've had moderate acne for the past several years and decided to try this after seeing ads and good reviews. I followed the manual to the letter on what type of blemishes to use this on and everything but alas, no improvement. It only made lesions larger, more painful, and more red, now with a large ring around them! No improvement on any of my acne after many attempts. Didn't work for me and I'd recommend NOT wasting your time and money."
1,What a scam,"Literally left scars on my face. Burn scars actually. Doesn't work. It just sucks that we're all so vain and self-conscious in this country (blame society) that we're willing to pay whatever amount of money for something like this. Seriously, not to get all philosophical, but with the premium we all place on physical appearance, even if we know there's little chance of a product actually doing what it claims we're still willing to take the chance... because WHAT IF? Ya know. $150, $200, whatever... we feel it's worth a shot. And the manufacturers of this junk get rich on our insecurities and nearly blind faith and optimism. BUNK !!!!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This does not work at all. I dislike the protective timer that prevents you from using it for more three times in a row. I found no success with it. Get a chemical peel instead.
1,2nd degree BURN,I have reports and images of myself with 2nd degree burns from ZENO. A man from ZENO just quit after seeing over 100 cases of damages done. My lawyers are taking this up with the FDA before this product tries to go to Europe.STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM IT!
1,Zeno Acne Clearing Device,"Since the time that I have had and used this device, I haven't had success on any problem area that was treated. As a matter of fact the pimple got just as big or bigger. I appled the Zeno treatment at 1st sign of a problem. I, also continued my cleansing regime that I had been doing. I just chalk it up as another product (of the countless products that I have tried) that just doesn't work.Thank YouRobert C Hunt"
3,Didn't work for me,"I used this for about 3 weeks and it made no difference. I followed the instructions the first few times, and when that didn't work, I tried using it more frequently than instructed. Still saw no difference. I'm still giving it 3 stars though, because you can return it if it doesn't work in the first month, so I didn't end up wasting all that money."
3,Middle of the Road,"Somewhat disappointed, not as effective as advertising would lead one to believe. Purchased for my teenager who as the normal occassinal problem with breakouts at inoppertune times."
1,NO REPLACEMENT TIPS AVAILABLE!!,"Zeno is no longer selling/supporting this product, so there are NO replacement tips available, other than at a several hundred percent markup here on Amazon! Do not buy this product!!!"
3,Mediocre,"This product isn't THAT great. First of all, it's way too expensive for what it is. Second of all, maybe I was confused by the advertising, but it doesn't work quite like I expected it. Only about 40% of the time does the pimple just ""disappear"" and heal. The other 60%, the zeno just makes it come to a head a lot quicker so it can be extracted. It does really help with the swelling, and accelerates the healing process, but I usually find it takes at least four treatments for one pimple. With a 60-count cartridge, that's enough treatments for only 15 pimples. And the treatment heads/cartridges are way too expensive!"
5,cell phone battery,sent me the wrong one but quickly and effortlessly got me the right one. Will definately do buisness with them again.
1,Disappointing slippers.,The slippers were for my husbands birthday....how embarrassing. For the money I was expecting the inside to be as soft and comfortable as clouds instead they are hard and not relaxing at all. I still gave them to my husband and he couldn't believe how much I paid for them. After giving them a shot around the house he noticed the fury stuff on the inside was coming out of the slippers in chunks. If anyone knows of slippers made in heaven....please let us know. We need some.
3,Jason's Natural Vitamine K,"I bought this product with hopes that it would help the redness on my cheeks. I have redness from spider veins. I have been using the product for approx 3 weeks now. I apply twice a day. I cannot see any difference so far. Since I spent the money, I will continue to use the product until it is all used up. I hope eventually it will actually make a noticeable difference.Thank goodness there is not much of a fragrance."
4,"Useful tool to have in your ""arsenal""","Have a set of Craftsman hooks and picks as well, lost one and decided to try these as replacements. They are longer (which can be good or bad depending on your needs) and the rubber-like grip slips off the handle easily if you don't hold the handle tight. Also, the shaft seems to come loose from the handle and requires an occasional tightening. I do however use these daily, so perhaps that has something to do with it. In spite of the issues, I still like these and have actually had customers comment on them (rarely get comments on my tools)."
1,Rubbish,Rubbish. It does not fit the camera Sony DSC-H3 which 47th Street Photo advertise it for. Because they won't post to addresses outside the States it took over 30 days to reach me so I can't send it back. I have written to 47th Street Photo 4 times and they don't reply. I now have a useless peice of plastic which is not even heavy enough to use a door stop. Don't be fooled by their product description.
3,Sprightly interpretation Symphony 9,"I might have given a higher rating were it not for Rafael Kubelik's grand and majestic interpretation of Dvorak's New World Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic (DG 447-412-2). Gunzenhauser's interpretation is obviously musical with direct, fluid and clean lines. However well done, this is one dimensional compared to Kubelik's version with more emotion, better musicians and better recording quality. These are the sense of space, interplay of instruments, dynamic range and bass weight. Stephen Gunzenhauser records extensively on the Naxos label."
3,Good book on grief,This was an order for a another used book I already had and wanted to give. Excellen ideas on loss.
4,"While not his best, still worth the read","Flotsam is the first of Remarque's refugee works (followed by Arch of Triumph and Shadows in Paradise). The themes he explored in The Three Comrades are here--the ill heroine, the WWI war veteran, etc. However, here the emphasis is on the absurdities that the nationless must face to survive. The work is interesting from a literary standpoint in that Remarque's writing is maturing, though he does seem to return to the same characters over and over--here, the Steiner figure is similar to Ravic in the Arch of Triumph, who, is similar to the main characters of Heaven Has No Favorites, Night in Lisbon, Shadows In Paradise and The Black Obelisk. Be that as it may, it is always a pleasure to read Remarque's world-weary wisdom of the old soldier."
5,What an inspirational story...,"What an inspirational story about facing the demons of our past through overcoming tragedy, adapting coping skills, and accepting tolerance. Bernie and Fritz have told such an intriguing story that it is hard to put the book down. The book bridges the opposite sides of the Holocaust through the eyes of youngsters, grabs your attention and doesn't let you go. It must be so therapeutic for the two survivors to talk about this horrific beginning of their life. A story very well written and a tribute to two wonderful, talented and successful men bonded by fate, forgiveness and an uncommon friendship."
4,An Uncommon Friendship,"Well written, interesting. This should dispell all those who claim the Holocaust did not occur."
5,Amazing,I never actally read the book but the guy who was in the consontraction camps visited my school and told us his story. It was an amazing experiance and something I won't forget. This book is sad and happy especially SPOILER ALERT-When the german solder adopts him END I would recommend this book to everyone!
3,Big Pan,I like the pan alright. It does warp when in the oven heating which I thought it wouldn't so thats disappointing and its kinda big for storing. But I like the silicone grip and it is non stick...so for the price...not a bad cookie sheet.
2,there are better,"Given all the positive reviews of this recording, I really hate to be a wet blanket, but as much as I admire the music of Dvorak, and am sure Mr. Gunzenhauser is an otherwise decent conductor, I can't help but feel he misses the boat when it comes to Dvorak. His dynamics are sudden, his phrasing is uncharacteristic and pedantic and the recorded sound leaves a lot to be desired. My impressions, unfortunately, apply to both symphonies. When we have such great recordings by Szell,Kubelik, Suitner and others, I rather regret having wasted money and shelf space on this one. The only advantage in having done so is to be able to make direct comparisons with various recordings of the same music, a pastime I hugely enjoy."
4,Myst IV,Very challenging game. Attention to detail is most important. Also it takes a lot of time to figure out the puzzles. It's a game that requires a lot of patience.
1,Junk,Crashed the system every time I tried to use it... gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash....
4,Good information and exercises,"I have to admit my knees did feel better after completing this DVD. It has good information, tips and some different exercise & stretching methods I haven't encountered before. The commercials at the beginning of the DVD are annoying but I just FF through them; didn't watch them at all. Also, the other annoying part of this video is the fact the instructor describes each exercise at a different location prior to actually viewing it being done at the exercise site. That didn't bother me so much but it was the fact that similar exercises were not clumped together (floor vs standing) so I wasn't prepared for the next segment. I found myself and my bad knees popping up and down the floor in between several exercises. Once I'm familiar with the DVD more it won't be as much of a problem but I found that to be a weird layout."
5,Made a Difference,"I blew out both knees in high school, had a total of 5 operations from age 16 to 18, and am now 49. I love to hike and bike, but it doesn't take much for my knees to ache -- especially when walking downhill or down stairs.I've been doing the exercises for three weeks now, and really notice a difference. I'm also having less of a problem with plantar faciitis, which has plagued me for the past 6 months.If you go to the extra features, you can just string together the exercises without the full description of why you're doing them. I do the exercises about 5 times a week -- I try to alternate between the full set and the 7-minute set.I've also loaned the DVD to two friends who have had knee replacements, and after trying it once, both ordered their own copy."
3,"ts'ok, kinda goony","Not bad, not good, but not bad. The gameplay is much like other myst except for the annoying Avatar alwasy tripping up on rope. you have to get into first person alot. The online part sux too, especially if you make yerself look like a fat guy, no one'll talk to you. URU, not that flashy guy with the muscles, you freak! As for the single play. It is simply myst with a little man on the screen. Kind of like those Star Wars action figures of the 70's replacing camera scenes. If you like dolls, go to Toys 'R US."
2,Got bored instantly,"I had just had surgery and wanted to keep occupied while recovering. I had really enjoyed the first two Myst games. I carefully read the reviews here and decided to give it a try.I doubt I will ever make it past the 2nd level. I quit just a few hours into it out of sheer apathy. I'm just not intrigued. Despite the detailed ability to dress/create your character I felt disconnected from any narrative. Also, you can't handle certain things. You can, in one sequence kick a piece of wood out of the way, but you cannot otherwise move it. This just seems lame. Wanted to like it, but didn't."
5,Deeply dark and demented,"Ruth Rendell is one of my favorite mystery writers of all time. I've read several Inspector Wexford novels but 'Lake' is different. The dark twisty plot and zany, sociopathic characters make this a must-read. I could not put this book down. Bottom line: This is an extremely entertaining fast-read with a suspense-filled plot and quirky characters."
2,"Nice Music, Mediocre Performance","This CD contains some exquisite pieces that aren't often found on recordings. I bought this CD specifically to have a recording of Cardoso's Milonga and Dyens' Tango en Skai. Gerald Garcia has received much praise, but I simply dislike the way he plays on this CD. The performance of the Milonga lacks rhythmic drive, and the sweeping phrases of the Tango en Skai are unclear at best. There are many better recordings of the famous Lauro pieces, and some of Cinco Piezas are given too soft a touch where more gusto is clearly called for (notably Acentuado). Despite my objections to the performer's interpretations, the brilliance of the compositions usually still shine through and alternative recordings are scarce. If you want a recorded version of these pieces for some reason (I like to play the Milonga), then buy this inexpensive CD. Otherwise, you might as well get a different one."
5,A must for any DT fan - definitely worth the import price,"If you don't take lenth into account, then I would list this as my favorite live recording from Dream Theater and one of my favorite live recordings ever. This performance features the band at a special, early point in their career and it's full of energy from start to finish. The biggest treat for me is hearing James LaBrie sing songs from When Dream and Day Unite, since that would be one of my favorite DT albums if not for the sub-par vocals of Charlie Domenici. It's also the only official live release with Kevin Moore on keyboards. Their performance of ""Surrounded"" really soars. My only complaint is that it's too short, but the quality more than makes up for the quantity."
4,Solano hair diffuser,"This is the diffuser that my hair stylist uses on my curly hair. She says it is the best design for limiting frizz and flyaways, but it was hard to find. I checked many stores in my city to no avail and was so glad to find it on amazon.com. Only drawback is that it does not fit all blowdryers."
5,Just What I Was Looking For,"I've been looking for a dishwasher-safe tomato knife that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This was exactly what I was looking for. I don't consider the blade to be too flexible, as has been cited by other reviewers. If you want something more substantial you could go with the Wusthoff Grand Prix Tomato Knife for $80. I've never been able to find that for less than $45 - even on eBay. The price is right for this brunch knife and it does a very good job."
5,Exceptionally well written book,"This is a very well written book. We have used this book for our financial management class Howard University. I personally proud to know that there are still people like Prof. Damodaran out there, people who can make time to ensure that knowledge is freely available to the students. Prof. Damodaran is one the best minds that has ever happened to the field of Finance."
5,Great dvd for aspiring lawyers,"This is a great movie for aspiring lawyers especially for the state of California. Here you will see how tedious, agonizing yet ultimately rewarding, the bar preparation is. This portrayed several bar hopefuls including one who had taken the bar exma at least 43 times."
1,not happy with amazon,"I have contacted them regarding the missing product I ordered, how do you not even put the product I paid for in the box!!!!!"
2,"Very Pretty, But Poorly Made","This is a very pretty set, but the very first time I used it, I found raw, sharp edges on the bottom of the handle of all the soup spoons digging into my hand. Not the quality I had expected from Oneida, but they seemed to have taken a new and inferior approach to their business vs the stuff I grew up with. I returned the set and won't try them again unless I read reports that they have returned to the practices that won their reputation."
2,Is this a scientific analysis of Star Trek or a soap box?,"As a Star Trek fan from its inception and a scientist, I was quite interested in this book when I found it in the local library. Unfortunately, the title and liner notes are deceiving. The majority of this book is not about the biology of ST characters, but about the authors opinions about just about any social issue you could name. The potentially interesting topics which begin to be addressed in the book get bogged down in the authors knee-jerk liberal attitudes re: feminism, capitalism, religion, the military-industrial complex, environmentalism, etc. Very tedious. In addition, the science is very superficial and in spots outright wrong, especially when she gets very far outside her area of expertise. I hope this topic is visited again by an author who is more scientifically astute and more open-minded."
1,If you want to frighten your child...buy this book.,"I bought this book because my 2 year old is in love with helicopters. I didn't bother reading past the first couple pages because I figured it had to be tame since the Duchess of York wrote it. I was wrong. The first few pages are fine, and then I found out what the story is about. A little girl is kidnapped and Budgie needs to help rescue her. There is even a picture of two men chasing after a little girl in pigtails. I stopped reading as soon as I realized what the story was about and deposited it straight in the trash. This book is inappropriate for children. Based on the pictures I just can't figure out what age group this would be appropriate for. I personally don't want to send my son to bed with nightmares."
5,Too Cool - A worthwhile 10 hours,"Candy had seen this series when it was originally televised and remembered it. Thanks to Amazon, we were able to purchase the set and have thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the concepts. As a bonus, the ""current time"" is 1976, I believe, and it is even more fun to have experienced the continuation of progress.We are now contemplating the second series."
4,i really like it,for $20 I would buy it again....its a good buy for the price...material is nice and soft and the fit is gr8.
2,BOBBY WOMACK I STILL LOVE YOU,I BOUGHT THIS CD KNOWING THAT SINCE IT WAS BOBBY WOMACK IT WOULD BE ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO.I WAS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED.A LOT OF THE SONGS I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE AND JUST DIDN'T LIKE.THE ONLY SONG THAT I ENJOYED AND KNEW ABOUT BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CD WAS (I WISH HE DIDN'T TRUST ME SO MUCH).WELL I STILL LOVE BOBBY WOMACK BUT IT WAS DISAPPOINTING///
1,The worst adaptation ever made.,"This movie is an abomination. Jane Austin would have been ashamed to watch some of it's scenes. The director took so many liberties with this movie its ridiculous. She purposefully changed the main character ""Fanny"" from a sweet, wise, innocent, and honest girl, to a feminist with an anti-slavery agenda which was not in the book at all! Miss Crawford is presented as bi-sexual and Mr. Crawford is actually presented in a likable manner when you are supposed to know he is a flirt and a scumbag! All the majesty of a beautiful, wealthy house is some how missing and all the characters are inaccurate in some way from the way Jane Austin wrote them.Do not buy this movie. EVER."
2,They might have walked past this book....,"but no one associated with this movie could possibly have actually read Mansfield Park. All the charm, the conflicts, most of the story, and all the sense have been removed. What is left is a hodge-podge of a movie that tries feebly to take on the issues of slavery but falls far short of success, while missing the entire point of the original story."
2,Not really Jane Austen,"I bought this expecting to see Mansfield Park in the format I had seen it on PBS. From the very first, it was clear that they had taken license with the book and with the other film version. Although this film had some interesting film moments, I could hardly recognize the ""plot"". If I hadn't already read the book, I might have enjoyed it more. If you are a Jane Austen fan, this is not your movie."
3,Not really Mansfield Park,"The makers ought to have just wrote their own script if this is what they planned on doing, but marketing will win over, I suppose. There is little resemblence between this and Jane Austen's novel.On its own, it's a good enough film. The villains are very bad and the heroine is likable enough, even if she does seem almost bi-polar at times. It is no surprise that she is oddly written, what with the spunk put into a character that is not supposed to have any. Of course, the basic plot points don't work with this new-found backbone and so they go back to shy Fanny Price when needed. The Bertram household versus the Price household was well enough done to make us believe that Fanny might marry a man that she doesn't love, but the added slavery subplot is strange and unnecessary. The ending was not romantic enough to be satisfactory after all of the melodrama.On a more vapid note, Johnny Lee Miller's lipstick really bothered me."
1,hardly resembles jane austen,"As a Jane Austen reader, I was very disappointed in this movie. It bears little resemblance to the novel, inserting sexual inuendos and perversions where none existed in Austen's writing. The characters are poorly portrayed, and the movie's only redeeming value is a happy ending."
3,Lacks the book's delicacy,"If you enjoy Edwardian drama that lets everything hang out, this film may be to your taste. It makes strong statements about infidelity, class relations, race relations. It's very much a 'tell all' of the rich and famous of that time. For that point, it's interesting.My chief complaint is the story is not as faithful to Jane Austen's work as it should be. There are so many ways this film differs from Jane Austen's version. Bluntly, it all comes down to the producer hammering watchers over the head with concepts such as slavery, infidelity, etc. that were touched on lightly in Austen's book.Rebecca Kyle, June 2008"
3,Could've been better,"I really liked this movie other than they put in several unnecessary things that were NOT in the book. And it says sexual content on the content advisory, but nothing about nudity and they show nipple! Even if for a moment it's still there. The drawings of what happened with the slaves were totally uncalled for as well, NOTHING like that in the book! Other than all that I think it was pretty enjoyable."
1,Jane is turning over in her grave!,"This movie is not worthy of being called a Jane Austen classic! The characters are not true to the book and the story has been monkeyed with as well. The social statements made are ones we may find pivitol for today, but were not primary issues of the 18th century and certainly not issues in this particular book. Buy any of the other recent J.A. movies - they're all worth your time and money - but leave this one on the shelf."
4,"Not True To The Novel, But An Enjoyable Movie","As an ardent Jane Austen fan, I approached my Mansfield Park viewing warily. I knew that it would be different from the book, but felt that since it was not one of my favorite Austen efforts I would be able to survive the inaccuracies without exploding with indignation. Happily, my concerns were unnecessary! I very much enjoyed the film. Fanny, who in the novel is quite insipid, in the movie very much resembles her creator (Miss Austen), and, in fact, much of the character's literary endeavors are taken from Austen's juvenalia. Frances O'Connor does a great job of portraying a woman who is happier in the background, yet fiercely resists being pushed into actions that violate her inner values. Another underrated plus for this film is Jonny Lee Miller's performance as Edmund. He is perfectly restrained and yet affectionate! This movie's no Pride & Prejudice, but it is a very rewarding experience."
2,Mansfield Park (1999),"This was not my favorite Austen book. Fanny Price is apretty dull, overly moralistic character. The movie jazzes upup this little family scene with issues like the dubiousorigins of the family fortune but takes away from Austen'sstory."
3,"Worth seeing if you are an Austen fan, but disappointing.","As a longtime fan of Jane Austen I was glad to finally see a movie version of one of my favourite books. However, I was very disappointed with the way Fanny was portrayed. Not that the acting was poor but the script did not depict the characters as I recall them.If you watch this without reading the book you will come away with a somewhat spiced-up version of the story, and to be honest, considering the type of person that this film is likely to attract (i.e. an Austen fan), I don't think the spice was at all necessary; but then it's never pleasant to see something you like changed!"
3,Don't Mess With Jane's Stuff,"It irked me that this director took so many liberties with Austen's story. Jane is so good she needs no help. There are plenty of Hollywood movies that make a social statement- I wanted Jane Austen, not filmdom political commentary. Also, after having seen Justine Waddell in Wives and Daughters, I realized she would have made a terrific Fannie Price. Casting Waddell as the younger sister (small role) was like having Peyton Manning on your team but using him as the backup quarterback."
2,A disappointment,"If not based on a Jane Austen novel I may have liked this movie better. In a world of course, stupidity based humor and overt sexuality I seek Jane Austen as my island away from it all. Current movies based on her work such as ""Emma"" with Gwyneth Paltrow, ""Sense and Sensibility"" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet and ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth capture the essence and beauty of her work. This version of ""Mansfield Park"" had the potential. A beautiful cast, the costumes, the English countryside but they lost the spirit of Ms. Austen. Miss Crawford's attentions towards Miss Price are at times uncomfortably sensual. There are illustrated scenes of sex and also brief nudity. Not at all what I expected from a movie based on the works of my beloved Ms. Austen."
4,Enchanting,"I absolutely LOVED this movie, seeing this movie is what led me to become an 'abashed' Jane Austen follower. I have seen nearly all of the movies that have been adapted from her writings. And as most know, movies rarely show justice to the original work, so I have ventured into reading the novels for further delight. The only sad thing is that I come up 'short' handed when looking for works that come even close to Jane Austen's tales. I should shamingly admit that I have not yet read Mansfield Park, but after seeing such low reviews on the movie, I feel that I must be missing something."
2,Who is Fanny Price?,"That was the question that came to me while watching this movie. This is a great departure from the story in Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park. If you are a big Austen fan I would stay away from this one. Although it was well acted, with beautiful scenery, there were too many elements from the novel which were missing in the movie."
1,Not Austin's MANSFIELD PARK!,"The movie takes Jane Austin's plot, mostly. It slaughters the characters, particularly Fanny Price. The young woman portrayed here bears no resemblance to Miss Austin's creation. She may be a spunky and ""modern"" person, but she does not have a fraction the depth of the original and is an almost total opposite of her. Edmund is reduced to a shadow figure. Sir Thomas and his lady are both villified, especially the latter. There is no excuse for the liberties taken. The producers could have done a parody set in the present time if they chose, but to destroy the original, to spoil it for people unfamiliar with the book, is unpardonable."
3,"Entertaining, but not what Jane Austen wrote","Having read a number of these reviews on Mansfield Park (movie), they all seem to focus on the changes in Fanny, the inclusion of anti-slavery themes. But little has been said about the changes done to the Crawfords. The movie makes them both out to be a plotting devious pair, far beyond anything that could be passed off as being Fanny's view of them.The movie is definitely not Mansfield Park as written by Jane Austen. But it is still entertaining, so long as you are prepared for the excessive devations from Austen."
1,Spare yourself!,What license was taken in this adaptation of Jane Austin's novel! This movie was [junk]. No doubt the late Miss Austin would have been mortified if she had seen this [distorted] portrayal of her novel. The characters in this film were extremely shallow. Not one of the actors portrayed their character as they ought. I was bitterly disappointed. I wish I would have never seen this film. I despise this movie. Spare yourself!
1,Dissapointed,"My daughter and I read the book at the same time. Having read the book, and knowing how difficult it was, we were both looking forward to treating ourselves to the movie version. How dissapointed we were! This version was nothing like the book."
4,"Here we go again. Maybe the 3rd try will be Fanny Price, just right","I can forgive the spunkier, prettier Fanny, because movie versions of everyone are prettier and spunkier, but the slavery issue was ill placed and distracting.This is not a particularly complicated story. The BBC, with all the time in the world to devote to story accuracy, gave us the uni-brow girl who was way too mousy and now we have a politically correct, social issue version.I still give it four stars because, while it is frustrating to see such deviation from the book; it was still a very fun movie to watch.Also; at 40:58 Crawford loses her place, the scoundrel."
2,Terrible Movie - please stop recommending to me !,This movie is a Hollywood version of parts of the book. I am not interested in the movie as the intent does not match Jane Austen's book. If an option of -10 was available I would gladly give that rating to this movie.
1,Completely awful!,"Rarely do I completely and wholeheartedly loathe an Austen adaptation. The Bollywood version Bride and Prejudice was delightful. The Kiera Knightley P&P; was ghastly, but mainly because the producers thought that a gentleman in 19th century Britain lived with chickens in his manor house. Shudder!But this was so completely horrible that I can't encourage anyone to watch it under any circumstances. It has NOTHING whatever to do with the Austen novel. Someone bought the title and then created an anti-slavery shock-and-rock period piece."
2,The agenda,"The screenplay in this movie was written to advance a commentary which was not part of the book. I don't require some screenwriter's social commentary in a Jane Austen story, thank you. The value of Austen's insights lay in the observations made in small circles of society and their easy translation to the wider world. In and of themselves, Jane Austen's insights are worthwhile. The screenwriter's foray into sensationalized slavery was ridiculous."
2,"Boring, my least favorite Nin book....","This book couldn't hold my interest if it had pop up cutouts. I've read alot of erotica, and I don't think this should be considered as such. It took forever to get to the good parts...if there were any!"
1,Check your premises,"The book may be well written, it may be interesting, but as there is no global warming, it is a piece of fiction.I never cease to be amazed why so many people seem to have the need to believe in some imanent doom. Maybe they believe in incipient disaster because it gives them the chance to order people about. I suggest that we all ignore the enviro-ninnies and go on living happy lives, free from the tension and pressure that these silly people foist upon us in the mistaken belief that they are helping us, whilst in truth they are really helping themselves."
5,Inspiring video,I watched this on PBS years ago and was happy to find it available online. Very inspirational. Wish I had the opportunity to meet this gentleman.
4,Great Read,"I truly enjoyed reading this book, made me want to pack up my things and head for the great outdoors!"
3,"Good, but in need of some background","This journal is well written, and skips a lot of boring little details while focusing on important and intersting things associated with living alone in Alaska, but it only covers the first 16 months of about 30 years, so it raises many more questions, than it provides answers. A complete biography should be added to the book. I did do some research, and learned a great deal more about the indiivual. My interest for reading this book came after seeing the video on PBS. It's diffintely worth the read.Chris of Boston"
3,a little bit boring,"I got this along with the DVD of the original show. It was OK but the visuals of the DVD made the book rather boring. However, I was quite pleased with the seller's prompt delivery and the very good condition of the purchase."
2,Nothing new,"If you've seen the PBS documentary which this book accompanies, don't bother reading the book. For about 300% more time (as compared to watching the film), you get an additional 10% of information (almost entirely relating to his encounters with wildlife and his views of modernity & technology circa 1968).I wanted to know who Richard Prohneke [sic] was, what was his profession, was he ever married, WHY did he build and live in a cabin in the woods, what happened after that 1st winter, etc. The book fails to answer any of my questions."
5,A classic - should be on every bookshelf,This is one the the books that cluttered my nightstand as a kid for about fifteen years. I think my grandmother bought it for me (she was always buying me books) and I never stopped reading it. For a certain person this story is completely thrilling. To leave 'civilization' and strike out on your own and make it by your own wits is darned compelling (and not easily accomplished.) Yet Keith never toots his own horn: he's happy with his life and hopes you are too.The photography is stunning and the rather gentle natual philosophy is sublime. Keith reminds us that the world can be a much more fulfilling place.
2,Sex in the City gets boring after a while,"I got about 50 pages into this journal before I gave it up. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of his sexual encounters with guys and dolls for a while, also the lists of various meals, but the getting stoned and rambling on philosophy was soooo Seventies! I flipped ahead but that was about it for the rest of the book. And unfortunately, when producing the book in 2002 from his old journals, the author decided to ""publish my journal exactly as I wrote it,"" with the unfinished sentences and syntax errors. This is too much enchantment with one's own process for my taste. Even Anais Nin edited her journals before she published them the first time (and not just to keep out the naughty bits, either)."
4,Well spent 40 minutes,"I'm an intermediate exerciser and try to do a mix of everything. This workout is definitely efficient and I love the way most of the firm dvds mix resistance training with calorie blasting cardio.Pluses: workout packs alot into 40 minutes, challenging, & good instructor.(I also got mine for a good price)Minuses: Not for a beginner unless you know how to modify the moves yourself (the camera doesn't really show the modified lady and some of the moves she didn't modify at all). Also the power moves include plyometrics which may not be good for some with hip/knee/ankle problems unless you modify it down. I don't do all the jumping and it's still a good workout."
5,A Great Workout!,"I have several workout videos from The Firm, and this may be my favorite! The music is great, and her moves are fast-paced and original. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants an hours worth of exercise in 40 minutes. Also, the bonus 15-min. routine is tough, and perfect for those days when I don't have much time but still want to burn some calories. Love it!"
4,"Not my favorite, but effective.","I have, over the years, bought many Firm videos. There was a period where they were not very well produced, but lately the quality of the instructors and producers has improved back to the level previously.The DVD--Get Chisled--is very similar to other firm DVD's. So much so that if you have Hard Core Fusion, TheFirm Bootcamp, or a few of the other sculpt focused titles, you won't need to purchase this one.Get Chisled does give you an all over workout for each major muscle group and there is cardio thrown in for extra burn. The instructor cues well, the music is upbeat and it is a nice length (about 45 minute workout), so that's the reason for the 4 stars. I had to take one star off for originality...seems like I've seen it before."
2,Too Aerobic For me!!!,"Plain and simple, the instructor moves very quickly from one move to the next WITH dumbells in hand and I had to slow it down and couldn't keep up. So, I'll stick with my Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, Trouble Zones and Bob's Weightloss Yoga...those are amazing!"
1,Damaged Does Not Work,"Dented, Dinged, Scratched, Chipped inside,trips circuit breaker when plugged in. No way did the factory recondition this item. I would have to guess a small run down fix it shop in Mexico is reconditioning these items. This product does not represent Delonghi quality."
3,RETRO CONVECTION OVEN,"BEAUTIFUL DESIGN I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND IN MY AREA. PACKAGING WAS A LITTLE FLIMSY THOUGH, NOT A LOT OF PADDING TO PROTECT PRODUCT DURING SHIPPING. CONVECTION AND REGULAR OVEN SEEM TO WORK FINE BUT ROTISSERIE TURNED TWICE AND STOPPED SO MAINLY USE FOR BAKING."
4,Great tool to learn chess.,"Chessmaster is a very useful tool if you are thinking of learning chess. The academy section makes learning chess fun and easy. It teaches you the basic movements and then it builds up and teaches you about pawn structure and strategy. Very useful exercises that will make you think, instead of making mechanical movements. My complaints are that I wish there were more endgame exercises. Also, it teaches one how to mate with rook and queen, but neglects to teach how to mate with two bishops and bishop and knight. It is difficult to mate with bishop and knight and it would have been a BIG plus if they had a section about that. Overall though this is a very good buy. You will learn a lot and it is not that expensive."
1,"game freezes, rarely works",Whenever we have played this game it freezes up on our computer and so it discourages my son from playing chess. I believe there is a bug in the program that prevents it from working properly. I don't recommend it.
1,Dont even waste your time,I wonder what the hell UBI was thinking.First of all you always need the cd in your drive to play...retarded. what if you have a tablet? are you going to carry that external cd drive with you everywhere just because you want to play chess? what if your running on battery power? are you gonna drain your laptop battery just cause you want to play chess?secondly forget about even trying to backup this cd. the amount of copy protection on it ...and upon all this the engine is faulty! a lot of times my opponent makes moves that are obviously wrong and that any chess amateur could see.. even when the ratings are in the 2000+ ration. This software is a total waste of time.dont even bother to use the only gameplay... have to enter a 16 digit cd key everytime you login. get fritz instead!!!!
4,Chessmaster 10th edition,"My son is 10 years old and has been competing in scholastic chess tournaments for the last three years. I have previously used chessmaster 7000, 8000, and 9000 to teach him the game. It has been a great help. I have purchased other chess software and have allowed him to use the one that he likes best for chess lessons. He always chooses the chessmaster. Now that we have Chessmaster 10th edition, I have introduced it to him. He has been using it for a a week now and he really enjoys it. He says that he likes it better than Chessmaster 9000. I asked him why and he stated he just likes the graphics better. He also likes the ""attacking chess lessons"" that comes with Chessmaster 10th edition."
1,Forget chessmaster,"I dumped this annoying to use, overglorified piece of crud and went out and got Fritz. Fritz rocks!"
5,Fun Chess Game,"""Chessmaster 10th Edition"" has a nice set of classes, for people who want to learn more about chess; a variety of opponents at different levels, so you won't get frustrated or borred; and a huge variety of chessboards. My daughter's favorite is the fairy tale animated chess board, where the pegasus Rook flies from one square to another. The game automatically redesigns itself to suit the player's age -- for example, young beginners will receive easy enough opponents that they won't get frustrated. The lessons are interesting, well split into small units, and sprinkled with wonderful ""try it out"" exercises. All told, I'm thrilled.I have a three year old computer and had no troubles getting this game to run. Yes, you do have to put the CD into your CD reader each time, but most computer games require this, so I'm not sure why some reviewers are offended."
1,Stay away from this rubbish,"I tried it on Windows 2000 with a cheap graphics card and it wouln't start: ""can not initialize 3D engine""In Windows XP with an expensive card it does start, but it is buggy and you need to have the CD in all the time.It can be funny, but if you play against one of the characters with a lower ranking they'll make silly mistakes and spoil your fun.I recommend to everybody to buy one of the Fritz series, especially one with the Fritz 9 interface: they are quite funny as well, you can play against many engines and there are many learning possibilities.If you are desperate to buy Chessmaster, see if you can get the 9000 version: it is better from many points of view."
1,Very disappointed!,I also have had very frustating problems playing this game - even on a desktop. It is very inconvenient to have to hunt down and insert the CD everytime you want to play the game. Imagin if you had to do that with all your software!
3,LAMAR Institute series is free download,Many books in the LAMAR Institute publication series are available for free download as .pdf files at lamarinstitute.org
4,whorgasm smothered single.,"while i only have the single, (promo only) i say it rules! its ""new metal"" before that was the term. i cant wait to get the cd now that ive found it. if you like korn, kitty, static x, zombie and the like i say buy this!"
4,The Covenant..,Great book. Really enjoyed getting to know a little about each character throughout the story. Can not wait to start the next book.
2,Covenant,Very sweet with real life struggles people and where in the world can relate to. Worth reading for young adults.
3,Reading from Siler City,"At first I was a little bored, I felt that it was hard to follow the characters. The middle of the book was really good but I was disappointed how it ended. You definitely have to read the next book to see what happens next."
4,Love book but...,"I found the book enjoyable to read with a couple of caveats. At the end it felt somewhat abruptly unfinished. Even understanding that it is a sequel, It seemed that there were a few too many loose ends. Also, the time to prune Apple trees should be late winter/early spring before the buds appear, not fall. Otherwise well written."
5,couldn't wait to read the next one,Her books really hold your attention. I like the way she weaves stories of salvation with knowledge of Amish life.
3,Not as good as other Amish fiction I have read,"The book was too long, and I ended up skimming through part of it. The story did not close the stories of the characters. There was some implied final resolution of the problems of some of the characters, but the reader is left guessing about interpretation. Something I did like about the book was that it described Amish life more than some. I will not say don't read it, but don't be surprised if you find that it drags."
3,The covenant,Lovely story of love and loss but do not like that I must read other books to have all of the story finish. The beliefs of the Amish are so strict that icoundnotrelateLovely story. Could not relate to their strict beliefs. I would like to have the story have more questions answered. To many open questions open.
3,Good book,This was a very good book to read. It was interesting and heart warming to see how important family was to them.
4,Amish life,"The Covenant is the first book in a series of five about Amish Leah. Worth reading if you want an insight into Amish thinking and lifestyle, and religious matters."
1,Dismal and Abysmal,"Preachy and simplistic--like it was written for a 12-year-old. Many of the plot lines drawn out or merely hinted at were left dangling--I guess we're supposed to hold our breath for the sequels. Since the direction the main plot was going in seemed obvious, it's not necessary for anyone to toil through another one of these maudlin, sappy, religious tracts!"
3,Its good!,"I learned alot about the Amish, and was surprised at some of things I didn't know. It was a nice book to read."
1,Covenant review,"This book was awesome! 5 stars! I a want to read the next book ""the betrayal!I cannot wait until I can get the next book! I could not put this book down!"
5,This book is so captivating!!!,"I was drawn into this at the beginning. And, I stayed up too late a few times just because I had to find out what happened next. I hope they offer a special price or FREE soon on the 2nd book. I need to continue the story."
2,The Covenant,"Was more then disappointed about the ending! Never shared whether her baby ended up!!!! The book had me hook, line, and sinker until the ending."
4,The Covenant (Abram's Daughters book 1),"I was glad to find out that the book continues. I became frustrated at the end of book 1, not realizing that it was a ""to be continued"" novel. Lewis sets up her characters well, but leaves all the story lines hanging at the end. I am compelled to read the series now."
2,Book one,I recommend readingThis book very interesting I feel teams should read this bookI enjoyed this one very much.
3,The Covenant,The book was alright but the ending was horrid. Where is the baby? And whatever happened to Sadie?It was different.
4,Amish stories,I haven't started to read it yet but looking at the first few pages it looks very good. Beverly Lewis is a good writer of Amish stories.
4,ONE OF HIS BEST 70' ALBUMS,"After 1970's ""CANTIGA DE LOUNGE"" this album (from 76') is probably his best 70's album. The album's got a lovely lush mid 70's MPB production, and exelent songwrighting trough out. JOYCE makes a guest apperance on one of the best tracks.If you like Brazilian music this album is unmissable."
5,Adorable Fun,"A chihuahualike dog, a bulldog, a pug and an anvil-headed English bull grace this delightful book for toddlers. The rhythm, the pictures and the durability of the book will certainly give it staying power with the preschool set."
3,"It clearly explains Japan discriminative constitution, but goes too far on telling-suggesting how to change it.","It clearly explains Japan discriminative constitution, but goes too far on telling-suggesting how to change it. As much as possible people should be aware of Japan open secrets, while my idea is that nobody should impose foreigners ideas on how to revise the country mind as westerns, but to avoid and be aware of this country."
2,Hard to set up?,"This HR monitor was recommended to me. The size is nice for a woman, but I'm finding it hard to set up. Also I think this will have interference with my FitBit, so I'm not sure I will be able to use it at all."
2,Timex or Polar? POLAR!,"I chose the Timex HRM over a Polar HRM because 1) This HRM has user changeable batteries on both the watch and chest strap (Polor chest strap batteries are not user changeable) and 2) I thought I could get the same features on a Timex as I could on a Polar but for less money. Let me just stay straight out, I returned this Timex after using it for a couple weeks (Amazon was great about the return) because I hated using it, and I now own a Polar FT4, which I LOVE! I found the Timex VERY diffult to set up, the buttons/menus are not intuitive, and the buttons are hard and ackward to push. It also overcounted calories burned."
5,"Wonder who bought this for ""Only Sixteen?""","While their cover of Only Sixteen was all over the radio, I wonder how many folks bought the LP after hearing that song, and discovered this stoner classic? This is music to listen to with a lot of friends, with plenty of various libations on hand. A true party album.As usual, the album contains great Shel Silverstein penned classics. Shel was at the top his game, and Dr. Hook delivers the songs with skillful wit. Interestingly enough, Dr. Hook as a band was bankrupt, and this album very well could have been their last. The success of Only Sixteen saved them, but alas, instead of more songs like The Millionaire and I Got Stoned, they went.... DISCO!!!! Bankrupt turned out to be the last, great Dr. Hook album. And what a great one it is!"
4,A solid deconstruction of a fascinating personality,"I found this to be a hypnotizing read, so much so that I paused reading another book in order to start this one -- a rare thing for a compulsive like me.Walker has obviously done a lot of research for the book. He quotes both die-hard Objectivists and anti-Objectivists alike. The intimate, personal anecdotes regarding Rand are very interesting.The book is not without flaws, however. Walker is remarkably objective for writing on such an emotional subject, but he can go into Rand-bashing mode occasionally. The cover is an unnecessary gimmick.I would have preferred more depth on the philoosophical roots of her ideas as well as what may have shaped her personality. Walker spends a bit too much time simply describing Rand's temper tantrums instead of looking for the causes of them.Overall, a must-read if you are at all interested in Objectivism in particular or cults in general."
1,Subjectivist howlings on being ignorant,"I couldn't finish it... this book is without purpose. The philosophy of Ayn is complete....... period. If your not an Objectivist, you are a parasite and ""don't deserve the title of human""."
1,Pick a different printer,"Have now worked with two Kodak printer docs, wanting to be able to just drop my Kodak camera on top to connect to PC or print directly. And now two printer docs have soon stopped picking up paper. Sometimes I can manually feed a sheet around the cartridge, but how convenient is that? You can read other with the same experiences, and worse. Pick another printer besides the Kodak."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Never has been reliable; will not pick up paper and YES, it was loaded correctly. The only thing it is good for is to charge the camera.I had to spend more money on A Kodak 500 that has been acceptable."
2,Paper feed problem,"Initially thrilled with ease of operation and print quality, but not anymore. The Kodak paper will no longer feed into the printer without much coaxing and then often jams. I now use my dell inkjet printer, Kodak picture paper for inkjets, and download pictures to the hard drive, sacrificing the picture quality, but allowing for picture editing. Would've been better off just purchasing the printer dock only (less printer)for much less."
1,No t Reliable,"Quirky, expensive and not reliable.Feeds poorly gets stuck and eats paper.The feeder gave out after printing less than 20 pictures.Mine is broke and they said it would cost $80 to fix."
2,Kodak is a major disappointment,"I bought this printer dock with a new Kodak camera, and have been truly disappointed. What few pictures it printed were of excellent quality, but the paper feeder has NEVER worked properly from the first time I took it out of the box. Now, having printed probably fewer than 50 photos over the life of the printer, the ink cartridge is jammed in the unit AND the paper feeder doesn't work properly. So much for giving a once-great American company the benefit of the doubt. Try HP or Canon instead."
5,Very good start,I thought this was a good book. The author had a rhythm to his work and the way Franklin writes -is like you can't put it down until at least the end of the chapter when you get a break! Never the less I read it in three days and I think it is outstanding and will be buying more of his books.
3,"a ""quick read"" to check out the library","If you read between the lines, one might be tempted to say this is a ""sista hating"" book. Once you get use to the author's style of writing (jumping from narrative to first person to second person) the book is fast paced and humorous. Usually you can predict what will happen in each chapter a few sentences in, but it does have some surprises. At times the book is not realistic...in fact you might say at times it is quite exaggerated. ""Fed Up..."" ties everything up in a neat, conclusive package in the end, but does manage to develop the main characters enough to hope Mr. White writes about them again and goes into more depth...with more realism."
4,A good read,"White's novel is a good read for men and women. Though at times the book was a little preachy, its characters and stories kept my attention from beginning to end."
5,Ten Stars---No doubt,I cant believe this book has been out for almost three years! I saw a lady reading it on the subway in NYC and picked it up and Mr. White had me on the subway--nodding my head in agreement with what we men go through on a daily basis. This book is all that. Should even be a movie. Keep up the good work and keep telling it like it T.I. IS!
3,A fair beginning for a first-time novelist.,"Fed Up read like a soap opera. I agree with some of the reviewers that someone could read the book in one night. Mr. White's writing has a rhythm that will make you read chapter after chapter without interruptions. I thought the ending was a little ""soft"" and disappointing as far as the characters are concerned; also, in terms of ""how"" he ended the book. It will be quite interesting to see if his next book will step up in terms of the issues Mr. White was trying to address."
5,Fed Up Was Fabulous,"All I can say is Great Book. The story lines was so real. You have all these very real family issues going on today and it captures a piece of all of them. I think all of us ladies have or have had a ""Kelly"" type friend in their lives. This sister can make a good man seriously ""Fed Up"". I will definately recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book. I truly enjoyed it."
2,misrepresentation in title and picture,I ordered this watch (Shoppingzulla was the actual vendor) and believed it was a strap watch as advertised. It has a chain link on the back not a buckle where it clasps. It was far too big for my wrist. Beware! I have to pay shipping twice now in order to get the right watch. Amazon needs to put up the picture shown on other sites that reveals the back of this watch and it needs to provide an accurate description.
1,POLL,"If you think this album is better than PCD album ""PCD"", vote this review ""not helpful"". If you hate these wh**es and love PCD (like me), vote this review ""helpful"".Let's see how many peole have s****y taste in music!"
1,Slater needs to do his homework.,"This series of books has continually frustrated me. People that he kills come back to life, air-to-air missile's are suddenly surface-to-air. He build's upon a story throughout his series yet he dosn't remember what he has already written in his previous books. The first book is good but it gets successfully worse after that. Case in point, the Submarine USS Regan supposidly sinks but then comes back to life. A submarine captain automatically becomes a SEAL and then returns to life as a captain. His premise and story line are good but his details and homework stink. It ruins the whole series. Don't waste your time, try Larry Bond."
4,"Read better, read worse","WW III presents a scenario, that if you failed politicalscience 101, might seem realistic. Plenty of action, butlots of poltical and military inaccuracies that were obviouseven when WW III was published in 1990 such as: Slater pointsout that the Berlin Wall has fallen, but for some reasondecides to say that Germany is still divided into 2 countries.Also, in the text he portays an AH-1 Cobra helicopter witha GAU-8 gun (the GAU-8 is mounted only on the A-10)!I didn't particularly appreciate the incredible amount oftypos, either.But, if you're willing to ignore all of these defects(I couldn't), WW III would be a top-notch read."
1,Not very readable,I have found it very challenging to get through this book. It is written in a very academic style and focuses considerably on previous research. I cannot understand from the discussion exactly what is being put forward as relevant understandings in today's world. I wish I had a dollar for every time the author says 'as I argued in...' or 'what I will argue in...'. This is driving me nuts. I have had a couple of tries at ploughing through this book but I just can't cope with the writing style.
3,Not Remastered beyond the 1990 CD version,I purchase this CD in the case it was actually remastered beyond the 1990 release. It is not. It's the same sound. Different packaging.I have enjoyed this music for many years. I had hoped for improved sound quality.
4,A good smooth jazz cd,"With fresh music plus one vocal interpretation of phil collins, this cd is a good selection for smooth jazz lovers"
2,No thanks,"I picked this book up because I saw the author interviewed on the Daily Show. Oops. I'm going to have to lower my trust in Jon Stewart a notch. One useful piece of advice I've received is not to be afraid to cut bait on a book that you don't really like. So after about 150 pages, I calling it quits with this one.This book is supposed to recount the author's experience of growing up with a father in the CIA but it reads like a history lecture--and a dull one at that. I'm not sure why Richardson writes as though he's trying to distance himself from the narrative as much as possible. I'm not sure why anyone outside of his immediate family or friends would be interested in this book: the personal narrative lacks warmth and emotion and the anecdotes only hint at the gripping spy stories a lifetime of Tom Clancy has prepared me for."
4,Works well,"Not a miracle treatment, but works to clean/protect. Not sticky. Haven't found anything better. (""View tips and guidelines | 6 more words required"")"
5,Thank you Mr. Robbins ... thank you very much,"Another Roadside Attraction was the the second Robbins book I've read after Jitterburg Perfume. I was deligted reading the first but felt really good when I turned the last page of this one. All that could be said about religion was there ... all I would like to write and share was already contained in this book. I just thought "" there is no way I could do this in such a talented and beautiful way "" so decided to give up writing. It is simply ""excellent""."
2,It just doesn't age well,"I read this during my wild rollicking college years, over twenty years ago, and thought it was one of the best things ever written. I went on to read everything else Robbins had written to that time and was smitten.And then I became an adult and now find his writing meaningless, trite, cutesy and I'm totally unable to relate. Does this mean I've become older and more curmudgeonly, have lost all sense of wonder? Not at all and in fact have a greater sense of wonder and enlightenment, but my critical thinking skills have just improved to the point where I can differentiate between good art and not good art. Literature this is not."
5,The first book in my love affair with Tom Robbins,"Another Roadside Attraction was the first Tom Robbins book I read, and I haven't been able to put him down yet. I love his style, his characters and his philosophy. Robbins weaves his thoughts on life, sex, religion and money together with an often hysterical and always entertaining plot. As much as I love the people I met in his book, Robbin's philosopy alone could support a fascinating book. He makes me want to leave my boring, ignorant consumer lifestyle behind to run away and join the circus."
3,"Last 50 pages are good, but.....",Let me just start out by saying that Robbins is God!!! He is brilliant-but this book isn't. Something about it I found cheesy and marketed. I hated Amanda because I thought she was very fake. It took me three months to read this book. I found it random in a random way; not in a calculated way like other Robbins novels. I don't see why other people like this book. Once it gets into the whole Jesus thing it's good....I wouldn't recomend staring with this one...it doesn't higlight Robbin's genius...
1,Confusing,"This book is about the everyday life and mishaps of a family of gypsies. The setting is in the early 90's and the place is no where in particular. The main characters of this book are Amanda, her husband, John Paul Ziller, and a Monkey named Moncule. The Zillers are traveling around searching for the perfect place to put up a zoo of sorts. When they pass an old run down Mom and Pop's, they had to buy it. The zoo is made up of 15 San Francisco garter snakes, a flea circus, a bowlegged chicken, a dead fly, and butterflies. This book is very confusing, and I do not recommend anybody reading it. The book jumps around from page to page, and goes on for 40 or 50 pages about nothing relevant. The writer uses words that a normal person would not use and then goes on for a page explanining the word. This book has got to be the worst written and flowing book I have ever read. I did not like this book and I am surprised that I finished reading it."
1,"Boring, ridiculous, unnecessary and futile book to read","This book reflects Tom Robbin's psychotic and confused mind by being just that -- psychotic and confusing. It glorifies the hippidom when it was totally a disgraceful time in America's history. Its sexual innuendoes are also offensive and unnecessarily explicit -- it is written as if it was meant to attract horny men. In one phrase: ""DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS."""
1,Why did Amazon recommend this to me?,"I bought this book when Amazon recommended it to me and after reading the many, many positive reviews. This was a mistake. After having read about half of it, I finally gave up. I then went online to actually research the book. I discovered that it was written in 1971 and has become ""A cultural icon for the ""Children of the Sixties."""" At this point everything finally made sense.For the majority of us born to that generation this book will largely be one long incoherent string of absurd and nonsensical rambling. Save your money."
2,Disappointed w/this book,"If you are seeking COLORED examples of Marbling paper techniques there are only two colored pixs included at the end of in this book(let). As a visual artist I like ""seeing"" the details in each of the marbling designs including seeing the color combinations used in creating the marbling papers. This book did not have what I was looking for, but if you don't mind the marbling designs being in black & white...this might work for you. It didn't for me.Also, IMO this is more of a booklet rather than a book b/c it is only 32 pages---am disappointed w/this book & am going to return it ASAP.Choyce2020"
3,good starter,"I was looking to branch out to other styles of music when I spotted this CD at a local store. I said ""what the heck"" and picked it up. For those I haven't been disappointed. I've never really listened to orchestra music much before I like CD. Considering how old most these songs are the quality isn't half bad, either. The majority of the songs are upbeat numbers. The songs I don't really like are ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" and ""Mood Indigo"". They're kind of dreary. The cd only clocks in at around a half hour but for the price that's not too bad. If you're interested in big band music this CD could be considered a good inexpensive place to start."
4,History we never Learn about,Although the book does focus on most of the white people who were racist... It also contains some helpful history on Native Americans and Vietnamese immigration. The history of racism is fairly hard to talk about without addressing the violence and hatred that has actually occurred.
3,Wes,Decent product but you can buy this for less at Walmart.I saw this for about 1/2 this cost.Vist Wally world 1st.
3,Canning kit,"I'm new to canning and I found that I didn't need every item in this kit. One thing that was very irritating was the magnet fell out of the ""lid grabber"" I put it back in and it seemed okay and then the second time I used it, it fell out again. Not too durable but the funnel and other pieces were handy."
5,Basic canning supplies,"This kit is just what I needed for my canning projects and the price is just right too. These items made my job safer, easier and neater. I had tried to purchase some of these items separately and could not find them or the price was out of the question. No more burned fingers or dropped jars for this girl! Thanks Amason!!LindaConyers, GA"
4,Worked great for me,I was not sure that this set was going to work after reading several reviews about the funnel warping and the maganet falling out. This was the 1st time I have ever canned on my own and I had to buy everything new. This set worked great so far. I have only used it once but it did what it was supposed to. Take a chance for this price.
2,price is outragous!!,"bought this with a canner and other items without knowing it is readily availabe at most stores that sell jars and lids.. diffrence is most stores sell it for $6.95 not $15.00 here.. felt like i was delt a ""movie theatre popcorn"" markup...never again"
5,Life in a Northern Town,"I love the cd, it's in perfect condition and the song is great! Thanks seller! A+ & recommended! Glad I found the song that I can enjoy and bring back memories of good times!"
4,The Edge of Forever,"The Edge of Forever, for a long time now this song has been in my head (heard it in Bueller's Day Off) but I never knew what the name of the song was or anything about it accept that it was in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This is one of my favorite songs now that iv'e found a copy, for anyone that likes 80's rock, this is the song."
3,looking for a song,"I love the music by Dream Academy, but I have been desperately looking for the instrumental version of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" (from Ferris Bueller's Day Off). I finally found it on an album called ""Boutique Chill"" - a compilation album sold on amazon for about $17. If you're looking for that version of that song, I thought I'd let everyone know."
5,The Dream Academy,"I have more people ask me who sings this CD when they get in my car. Most people have no idea who this excellent group is. The songs just seem to flow together and yet each song remains apart. Is there a better song that nobody has ever heard of than ""Love Parade""? This is one of the few CD's in my collection that I can listen to repeatedly."
5,better than I expected,"Having seen some of the reviews here about the book having bad humor and being a non-objective backlash full of ad hominem, my hopes weren't high. But as a 12-year professional software developer, I found the book to be quite good: it gives a meaty, objective analysis of the many flaws with XP, in an entertaining way. The sardonic humor helps give emotional heft to the criticisms, and there are so many serious criticisms to make of XP that without the humor the book would have seemed very negative and heavy indeed. By the way, the numerous parodies and song-manglings are clearly marked and easily skipped, if you just want to get on with business.The authors also do not shy away from giving XP credit over and over, and the book never seemed unfair to me. This is not bashing, but entertaining analysis.Having wondered for a few years over the merits of XP practices, I now feel much clearer about the good and the bad having read this book."
4,Decent little blade,"I bought this with the Magic Razorless Shaving Cream. I looks like it does in the package and works fine. My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a really sharp edge. It has a few ripples in the sharp end, which I figure are small imperfections."
1,Don't Buy,Don't buy this product. I bought it from Best Buy and it wouldn't read the music on my ipod. Then I tried returning to Best Buy and they woudln't help me out whatsoever.
4,"Good, but it's not about `real' punk.","I feel that there is some confusion about what this book sets out to do. It isn't a review of todays underground punk scene. It is a look at todays commercial punk scene. Unlike other reviewers I never felt that Arnolds was trying to claim that Rancid, Green Day, and the Offspring are real punk bands. She was using them as examples of bands that started off with punk roots and then followed them to see what happened when they went comercial.Will you like this book? Well it depends what you want. If you want a look at how punk went from an underground sub-culture to the phony commercial MTV and Snow-board trend it is today, then this is a good book for you. If you want a book about todays underground punk culture look elsewhere"
2,No real punk reviewed here!,"This book is well-written and well intentioned, but basically is well, pretty boring. There are no real punk bands represented here! The last good real punk band hasn't been around for quite some time(insert '70's genuises here). The Offspring?! You have to be kidding! They couldn't find punk if you spotted them the `p` and the `k`!One note: Punk is about attitude, true, but it's supposed to be about music,lest we forget! And Nirvana made really good music and also rid us of the Wingers and Loverboys of the world. THANK YOU!!!"
3,"Parts can be approved, but the NRSV as a whole is rejected","Yes many would be surprised to find the NRSV quoted in many official church publications such as the catechism however what must be noted here is that quotes, verses, chapters or books can be approved for use in an official publication, but a single problematic verse can result in an overall rejection of the entire bible. The case with the NRSV is that it is rejected for liturgical use by the Holy See but parts of it may be quoted and have been. If you want to find official bibles then the modern versions are: New American Bible (for Americans), Revised Standard Version or Jerusalem Bible (for Europeans). Personally I own a New Jerusalem Bible because it is an update of the Jerusalem Bible and contains dead sea scroll translations, however the NJB is rejected by the RCC for liturgical use because it contains, what is called, inclusive language. I am sure inclusive language is the reason why the NRSV was rejected."
2,Boring,"Patrick O'Brian was only fourteen when he wrote CAESAR, and it shows. The writing is clunky, the story repetitive, and the transitions between scenes awkward. I suppose O'Brian fans might enjoy reading one of his first stories, but I don't know his work, so I just found it boring."
1,No thank you.,"Reading time is precious. I always used to finish every book I started, but as I've gotten older, I've abandoned this policy. Now I quit 1/3 of the way through if I am not enjoying a book. This book found it's way into the DISCARD pile. I really did not like it. I found it dull."
2,Alice in Wonderland,"This book was a disappointment after the first 50 pages....I guess that once you are famous anything can get published ....there was no recognizable character in this novel.The main character is obviously a loner, conceited and self-centered....seducing a 70 year old man and not revealing a child's medical condition because she's be parted from her makes her selfish....read Charming Billy and then stop."
3,Too Good To Be True,"I thought it was well written, but I was frustrated at the perfection of the main character Teresa, who took excellant care of everyone in the world at age 15. In fact, all children preferred her to their own parents. She also was care giver for her little cousin, but seemed unmoved when her cousin got sick and died. The whole dying thing was glossed over even though the book constantly built up to the impending health crisis of ""poor Daisy""."
1,Child of my Heart,"15 year old Theresa, nanny to the wealthy on Long Island, comes off as Mary Poppins or Peter Pan.Everything she does, she does perfectly, and all the children and animals in her care love her more than their own families. She is evidently very beautiful and she knows it. I found the book dull. It was very flat. I never felt anything at all in reading this book. No joy, sadness, anger, humor....nothing! Theresa spoke of everything that occurred, including Daisy's situation, and the experience with the old man, in the same matter of fact tone that she used when speaking of going to the beach or walking the dogs.Perhaps I'm a little too old and that this book would appeal primarily to young adults."
4,"Excellent storytelling, but lacks illumination","I enjoyed this book and the relationship between Theresa and Daisy. The writing was excellent and the descriptions of minor characters like the people who own the Scottish Terriers, clear and precise. However, I didn't really understand Theresa's motivations for her actions, nor did I get that delicious gut feeling that I got reading Elizabeth Berg's novels about a girl around this age. Those are really heartstring tugging. I suppose McDermott wants to take a cooler approach and more distant. My other problem with this book is that summer days are inevitably repetitious, which made the book repetitious.I also do not believe for a moment that a 15-year old girl would remain naked under a blanket tent on a busy beach for even a millisecond."
3,Not Great,"Outfit looks like Black Widow,belt and wrist bracelets look close but are yellow which is gaudy,her face is hideous,hair is right color but I don't recommend buying this figure if your looking for a Black Widow."
5,dis is sum kuhl stuff,"This is a must if you are into electronic music. It's a bit mellow, with spacy, dub, ambient, electro, lush, groovey, reggae, celtic qualities to it. Yes, it's all that!!!! The CD keeps getting played in my car, and the tapes that I made for a few friends have gotten played so much that they've asked me to make new copies for them. ... Buy it now."
4,Enduring sounds from the 90's,"Rediscovered this old friend in my mp3 collection recently and had forgotten what a great album it was. Somehow it's one of those fleeting albums that you might get tired of relatively quickly, but is something you'll want to keep coming back to year after year given enough time. Listening to it now it captures the trippy electronic sounds of the 90's merged with 'real music' dub / ambient.Since I'm currently taking a lot of Vicodin and Dilaudid for nasty case of Sciatica this provides a perfect backdrop of my opiate laced state of mind :)"
5,They've worked well - so far,"External Torx sockets are notorious for rounding off or twisting. So far, these GearWrench sockets have done well but I haven't really put them to the test in a high torque situation yet. They've stayed solid in their 3/8"" and 1/4"" socket bases and they've kept a sharp edge on the splines. The splines are superior in hardness to the Lisle Torx sockets."
1,don't bother,"Patsy Ramsey and Misty Bernall should collaberate on the next one. It could be self-help: ""How to make money from the death of your daughter""."
1,Wake Up America,Let's make this very clear to everyone:G U I L T YUpdate:I can say I could have been wrong. Wait until all the evidence comes forward with John Mark Karr before we assume guilt. I can admit a mistake if this person proves to be the killer.
3,Glad I read the Book,"I, like so many others thought for sure the Ramsey's were guilty. Then I bought the book and after reading it, am convinced they aren't guilty. By reading this book, it has shown me that you can't believe one thing the media brings up.They (the media) are so desperate to sell a story, they will go to any lengths. It was somewhat hard to read at times because you didn't know who was ""talking"". A little ""choppy"". None the less, I'm glad I read it."
4,Good read; hard to follow,"This book was written well enough; but a lot of times it was hard to follow. The timeline jumps around so much, it's hard to keep track of when things were happening. It was also hard to follow because the narrating jumped between Patsy and John and I was never sure when I started reading a paragraph, who was speaking.As far as guilt or innocence, I believe that the media can take something simple and turn it into whatever they want. It is hard to make people change their minds once they are set on believing something. I feel badly that Patsy was never able to find the killer of her daughter before she passed. We all can only hope that one day that person will be brought to trial for the crime."
1,CoCo Chanel Never Looked So Good Until Patsy Stopped Bathing,"This book is filled with misinformation. Don't waste your money. Patsy Ramsey is more concerned about defending her wardrobe choices than talking about her poor dead child. Burke, who's Burke? Their internet slave is mentioned more than he is."
2,Ramsey Enigma,"Fascinating! ""Death"" is a journey into the mindset of the enigmatic couple from Atlanta who calmly describes the murder of their daughter ~ JonBenet Ramsey ~ on national T.V., as they promote the sale of this book which serves as the script for those interviews.One intriguing aspect in the book is the scorn the Ramseys express for the very media which reportedly feeds them millions of dollars in the form of law suit settlements as they figuratively dance on the grave of their daughter.Required reading for those who have followed the investigation, DOI is predictable, likely to appeal to the uninformed or naive, and more revealing than intended."
1,Self-Absorbed-Bull,"This was the worst book I`ve ever read. The Ramsey`s ramble on about themselves endlessly. They have no fond memories they share about their daughter, and barely mention their son. They can`t remember anything about the night their little girl was murdered, but Patsy can remember how many times she blinked years upon years ago. Lots of psycho-babble(using religion) about JonBenet being better off where she is now, and decorating a Christmas tree with a purple ribbon. The whole book makes them look guilty as sin. Enough said."
1,This is not about Jon-Benet,"Putting guilt or innocence aside, this book is not about Jon-Benet and her murder,it's about the parents. Written by themselves, with probably the help of others, this portrayal of innocence lost and tradegy obtained is nothing more than a spewing forth of their own personal reflections on themselves. It's shallow beyond belief. How these people can talk about being Christian when all they talk about is things, is beyond me."
2,only for those obsessed,"If you've followed this case closely, you will learn very little from this book. The majority of the text is devoted to descriptions of their grief, their religiousness, and their victimization by the media and the ""bias"" BPD. Patsy's personality does seep through in this 400 page PR spin, and there is further evidence of her melodramatic, over the top, self centered personality. While there remains no hint of a motive for a murder, the reader is convinced that she was capable of staging the scene. Don't miss the opportunity to get a chuckle out of Patsy's attempt to claim she avoids coverage of this case. She is the ultimate media queen, and I wouldn't be surprised if she sought a regular newspaper column or radio or tv hosting op to keep her mug in the spotlight."
5,great book,"After reading ""The Death of Innocence"", my opinion in the Ramsey case changed. I strongly believe that the Ramsey's are innocent of the vicious crime. The book takes you into the Ramsey's past life, and brings you into the precious memories they had with JonBenet in her last years."
4,Serious Perl programmers only,"As you can imagine, this short book is only for the serious Perl guru. The first half of the book is on the Perl 6 language and is so terse that it's only readable by experienced Perl programmers. The second half of the book covers Parrot, the new Perl Virtual Machine. This is seriously hard core material, which is useful if you plan to write your own compiler to fit on top of the machine.Doubtless this is some cutting edge and impressive material, but the book has no ramp for beginners. If your job depends on high-end Perl, you will want to read this book. If you are an average Perl user you can probably wait for the next version of Programming Perl."
3,Kid Swipe is more like it...,"You think American Badass is awesome? You think its the best thing Kid Rock has done?NONE of th music on this track is original. The ENTIRE music track is a lift from Metallica's song Sad But True - Kid Swipe didn't even bother to re-mix it or just use a sample. HE USED THE ENTIRE SONG and just rapped over the music.I have 'Devil Without A Cause' and I think that is a great album but if this is the effort Rock is gonna put out after hittin the big time, it won't be long before we see him and Joe C. on the next VH-1 'Where Are They Now?"""
4,Butterfly 5pc Dress Up Set,Dress is beautiful. Shoes were very small compared to the dress size. It was difficult to know what you were getting the way the page was set up and no real description of what the 5 pieces were. The dress was beautiful though so it was worth the money.
5,GREAT!,"WELL, I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS GOING TO BE CORNY. BOY! WAS I WRONG. THE BOOK WAS GREAT. I LOVED IT. IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL MY FRIENDS. I PLAN ON GETTING HIS FIRST NOVEL THIS WEEK AND I ALSO PLAN ON GETTING HIS NEXT NOVEL. FRANKLIN KNOWS HOW TO WRITE A BOOK. GOOD JOB!"
3,A Tale of Two Cities,I really was looking for the movie not the TV version. I brought back memories.
3,"Good, but too many bugs","This book is probably the best single book available in Operational Risk at the moment. It give a very nice overview of the topic and on implementation possibilities.Still, there are some letdowns:1. The last parts on hedging and operational risk management are not very helpful while the part on operational VaR should be expanded.2. The book contains quite a number of errors. While this is not so important if this happens in written text, it definitely is within formulas (as in density of the normal distribution on page 50, and several others), especially since not everybody will see this kind of mistake at first sight. It should have been revised once more, maybe.Still, I recommend to anyone who wants to get an overview of operational risk. But read carefully."
1,Mistakes everywhere,"Because it was recommended by someone else, I chose this book to use in a class where we used a few weeks to cover the fundamentals of operational risk. It was my worst choice ever. It's true that the book contains many good ideas on risk management. But, from the quantitative point of view it's terrible. I think not a single page is free of mistakes. If you're thinking of implementing something, this book is useless. You'll end up looking somewhere else to get the right formulas."
1,Will they ever release a Starforce free version?,I would love to buy this game but I do not want to risk harm to my computer from the hidden Starforce copy protection. Google it...I'm sure all the people that wanted it already have it legal or not. I would like to buy a copy without the damaging Starforce.I've heard there are illegal versions available but I want to buy it Ubi Soft! There are many games I've bought and played that don't use this draconian method of copy protection.
2,Fun game but too many bugs,"The simulation is excellent and generally rewards the use of correct tactics. I would recommend some better options for crew management, like a ""watchbill"" function to make rotating crew stations easier.But I've gotten completely tired of trying to tweak my computer to deal with the crashes. My attempts to contact [...].com have been futile (some sort of ""unexpected error"" which prevents me from logging in) and the responses on the community forum are generally snotty techno-weenie remarks in the vein of ""the code is perfect so you must be an idiot"". No, I'm just a customer. Or in this case former customer. If the product supports a given hardware set then I should be able to install it and run it without spending hours reconfiguring my computer. The other games I've installed have bugs but don't crash my computer--just SH3."
1,"Crash, crash, blue screen, crash, blue screen, crash","I meet all system mins and then some. This game crashes constantly. I upgraded with lastest patches, no help. From the tiny bit I was able to play it seemed like it would have been a good game. So UBISoft, where are your QA people?Don't waste your money...."
1,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","This would be a great submarine sim (I love submarine sims!) if the software worked. It doesn't. Further, UbiSoft's technical support is abysmal -- ""Just do a clean reinstall and start over.""1.) Game crashes and/or freezes frequently.2.) Saved games are arbitraily lost.3.) Time acceleration can dump you in the midst of attacking destroyers and bombers, even if it's the middle of the night in a rain storm. Sometimes, the destroyers are invisible!4.) When you try to upgrade your submarine, you die. Only, you don't know it until the next time you start the game.My machine may not be the hottest thing going, but it's plenty good enough to meet the stated minimums for this POS.Summary: This is a potentially wonderful sim wrtten by crappy programmers. If you get it for $9 you paid too much. If you spend your $ on this, good luck."
3,High quality but very easy,"I really like Patricia as an instructor yet I'm often frustrated by her output. This workout has her trademark excellent cuing and charismatic energy but it's very easy, both in terms of choreography and cardio intensity. I didn't really sweat doing it and I'm only in average shape. She also uses the TIFT style of cuing that is a little out of vogue these days. With moves this simple, I don't want to keep repeating them. I gave this three stars because this would be an excellent choice for someone just starting out or recovering from an injury. The workout itself is filmed professionally in a well-lit indoor location (unlike many Gaiam DVD's that are outdoors) and the entire cast seems to be having a good time without appearing cheesy.For others, the best Patricia Moreno workout I've encountered thus far has been IntenSati."
1,DO NOT BUY,This HDMI wall plate will break as soon as you touch it. Most HDMI wall plates on amazon are garbage. Radioshack has them for $14.99.
4,First impressions are deceiving,"When I first began reading this book, I found it's first chapter off-putting because it was all about later exploration. Later though as I reread the book I noted the narrative approach the author takes and I think that this makes the book more attractive to children. I would have preferred a different organization of the material, but it is unique and the book did engage my children in the life of Prince Henry."
4,Piano is great,The mix could be better. I would like the percussion to be lower and the piano to be louder because I really wanted to find an album that was almost all piano.
2,Don't bother,"The headset was flimsy and gave me a headache. It was not the same headset as seen in the picture. Also, I hiked with it and could not see much of anything and the images were blurred. It was hard to tell the distance of things like trees and branches. It made the hike unenjoyable. Plus, I bought it for nighttime wildlife viewing, but it lights up at night, making it impossible to hide from wildlife in the dark."
1,Trash!,"Used it right out of the box when I bought it and worked fine. Headgear is useless! Chunked it in the trash first time I tried to use it! Junk :( Also Nightvision is junk! worked one time! now it won't work, good waste of $300! Buys PVS-14 way more expensive & Gen3 Mil Issue but at least it works when you turn it on."
4,Readable and Informative,"This book uses that solid Ballantine mix of readable prose, wartime photos, and useful illustrations. Readers learn about the successes and failures of airborne units during World War II. The author begins by examining the Allied effort in September, 1944 during Operation Market Garden (A Bridge Too Far), when U.S. and British paratroopers secured bridges in an attempt to faciliate flanking German defenses. Then the author backtracks and describes the background and development of Airborne units. Readers learn about German Airborne attacks in the Low Countries and Crete earlier in the war, then later efforts by the Allies, particularly their successful role in the D-Day invasion. There is also brief looks at airborne in other war theaters, at times by other nations. The concise, readable book does a nice job for military buffs and others with an interest in airborne."
5,Eye Opening,"I told my husband that of all the parenting books I have read, this is THE ONE I want him to read. IT is that insightful."
5,Challenging,"It's not every day you see a book with all five-star reviews, but this book deserves it. It challenges many near-universal parenting beliefs, and it'll make you think, even if you think some of its ideas are from left field."
4,"Good knife, good deal","Not as sturdy as I thought it would be. The handle is lightweight plastic, doesn't feel solid like you think a Wusthof would. Blade is flexible too. The package was labeled sandwich slicer and I can see why. BUT, I did use it for this past Thanksgiving and it was great. Nice feel to it and because it's new, it cut through everything the turkey had to offer. I can see using this to carve ham, roasts, etc. It will become my #1 knife to do those things, so for that, it does what it advertises and does it well."
5,Sammy loves these treats,I buy mellow mutts for our dog Sammy. He gets nervous during storms and when I know one is commiing I start to give them to him. They seem to help him Mellow out during the storm and we all feel better.Thank you for this wonderful product.Mindy
4,Don't worry about the specs,"I got this game even though I was a little worried about whether or not my graphics card would run it. I have an intel integrated graphics card and I was afraid my computer wouldn't be able to handle the program. I didn't need to be afraid. The program installed in less than five minutes, despite the fact that it needs 1.5 GB. It runs smoothly with just a tiny bit of lag. I am impressed by the graphics and realism, however the three day event scoring is unrealistic. There is no limit on how many refusals your horse can have. I would recommend this game to just about anyone who wants a challenging horse game with nice graphics."
1,Building Architectural Models,"The title for this book is very misleading! This is truly an amatures guide. This is something that your Grandmother might put together, for Arts and Crafts. The skill level for these examples is really novice and is clearly shown by the decent photography. If you have never built a simple formcore model, this book is for you. I am an experenced model builder and purchased this book to find something new in it that might help me. NO such luck."
1,WOW What a let down!!,"I agree one star is way to gracious. I wished I had read the reviews rather than be exciting about finding a new ""building structures"" book and just ordering.The books starts out saying its for high school and college architectural modelers. It should say it's for no more than 5th graders. They use foam core for many of the models. I was ready to see the authors use milk cartons! Its that bad. They try to pass off a stone facade with aquarium gravel!?! Are you kidding me! Plus some of the structures shown in the book are falling apart! Pul-eaze!There is better info on scratch building structures for free online at some model railroad websites and forums such as http://www.railroad-line.com/forum/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=25So don't waste your money. Or if your insistent, send me the $15 and I'll send you my copy. I only looked thru it once."
4,Building models of scale buildings,"The book is well illustrated and is a good, generalized treatment of the subject matter -- building architectural models. Good enough for the beginner and perhaps for those completing more advanced models, it had enough specifics to allow construction of reasonably accurate and attractive models for general use. Covered as materials were foam board, wood lathe and uses of acrylic for windows. Cautionary material was included too in the uses of various finishes for the product -- what works, and what doesn't. All in all, the book is a good introductory allowing the average person to develop skills to produce small models for proposed building projects that they may desire to build/have built on their property."
3,There's a time and a Place for Everything...,"Do you always stand out by following the trends of others? You can do many insightful things in college by conforming your style, but is it always the thing you wanted to make? Inspiration has hit me a few times in life and I have to say that it did not follow in these footsteps.So, do you trade for grades or do you say what you need to say?"
3,Not very modern...,"This book was recommended for one of my classes. However, the book is not very useful. I tried to find the correct way to cite a web page - but the book doesn't list any type of electronic sources. It desperately needs to be updated to include modern technology."
5,Extraordinary... educational as well as highly entertaining,"(...) Radical Son is much more than an autobiography. It is a first-hand chronicle of the roots of the modern progressive movement, from one of the people who helped create it. His fascinating account of his parents in a communist cell in 1940âs New York will keep the thoughtful reader spellbound, and his insider account of the radical movement in sixties Berkeley is fascinating, enlightening, and highly entertaining. From Paul Robeson to Tom Hayden, from Bertrand Russell to Huey Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, many of the famous, almost fabulous, names that have come to represent the sixties radical culture appear in this book, stripped of their half-mythical trappings and presented as the often deeply flawed people they really were.Read this book. Youâll learn a lot that you didnât know before, and youâll enjoy the ride."
4,Leftist Beware,An excellent author who describes his complete 180 degree turnaround in political beliefs with great detail.Horowitz is unafraid to confront even the most sacred of liberal philosophy and this book is an excellent insight into where he came from and where he is now.A good read.
1,hilariously awful,"Yes, this is a terrible book, but all the justifications of it presented here are even worse and so simple minded. This whole ""I told you so"" justification that is presented here, as if one man's mistake should mean anything at all. Of course, it does since it is part of the rising tide of intolerance and bigotry. Horowitz is a sad case and a truly self-hating individual. One thing though - this book is a Freudian analyst's dream."
4,Precient in its view of America,"Back in 1999, my daughter purchased an autographed copy from the author while she was a student at UCLA. Now that I am in semi-retirement I have had a chance to read this well written biography. It is more than a biography. It is actually a great chronicle of the left in the late sixties and early seventies. Many of the left's characters are there: Bill Ayers, Jerry Brown, Tom Hayden, Jane Fonda, Bernadine Dorn, Sidney Blumenthal etc. It is amazing to see how as a movement, many of these people have wormed their way into academia, the media, and politics. Today unfortunately, we are reaping the results of what was sown in the sixties."
3,Academic discussion,This book examines the literary writings of all of the most prominent great woman writers to explore the idea that women bring something special to the field that cannot be attained by their male counterparts.
5,Kids love them,We have several of the Cedarmont Kids DVDs and I think the best review is how my kids react to them. They love them. I have a 10 month old who will immediately stop fussing when they are turned on and a 3 year old who asks them to be played over and over again and has most of the songs memorized. I enjoy the variety and creativity they use for the videos which seem to be well suited for younger kids. We will continue to buy more of their videos as they are a staple in our DVD collection.
2,"strange, obscure, and dull","This novel did absolutely nothing for me. It has 2-dimensional characters - a self-absorbed millionaire, a beautiful promiscuous daughter, a young idealist from a lower class, a cynical philosophical doctor - that debate obscure subjects at great length, utterly lacking in realism or drama or even intellectual interest. OK, it is supposed to be a black-comedic statement on California's narcissistic and superficial society, but it is really little more than a crushing bore. The plot revolves around the rich man's search for immortality, with a funny climax when he discovers what it will actually cost.Not recommended. This is a chore to be studied by some, enjoyed by very few."
1,Not a Catholic book,"This is not a Catholic book, but rather an anti-Catholic book. It denegrates the holy sacrament of confession and should not be listed under Catholic books. A disgruntled ex-priest cannot speak for the Church or for the experience of women in general or faithful Catholics. Don't waste your time reading this."
1,Don't even bother,"As soon as I tried to load this software, my security software popped up with a message that the program contained adware that could collect browsing history and send it out to a remote server. Maybe that's why the price was so low. ($19.95 from the publisher) I'll look for something else."
1,No Customer Support,"I bought this software and was unable to load it on my computer. My computer met the minimum requirements, but after I came home and tried to load it on the computer it would not load. Come to find out, XP users may have difficulty.....WHAT? It says XP on the box. When I tried to get support, they have no phone number, no e-mail (fishy for a software company) and you have to write them a letter, which they never write back. DO NOT BUT ANYTHING FROM VALUSOFT!"
1,Waste of Money,"Software won't install, Tech Support sent an email stating to wash the CD with warm water and let it air dry. This was new software opened for the first time - should have been clean, but I washed it anyway --- Still Wouldn't Install. Tech Support sugested several other fixes by email --- all seemed very technical to me --- I wanted to use the program I bought, not work on it. Save your money, find another program that works right out of the box."
1,Is it a compatibility issue??,I bought a 25 pack of Ridata DVD+R media for my DVD+R/RW drive. I tried to record two discs and created two coasters. The same content was written without any problems on to a (even cheaper)Yamakawa DVD+R media and on to a TDK DVD+R media with out any problem. I have a HP 200j DVD writer built in on my HP PC. This is the first time ever I was unsuccessful in creating a copy because of the DVD media. I don't know if it is a comaptibily. I am afraid I am going to create 25 coasters for use all around the house.
2,Only 2.4X on my NEC Burner,I was a bit dissapointed to see only 2.4X available to write with my drive. I've used Ritech plain silver DVD+R and had no problem with 4X. Won't buy these again. I will keep them becaue I only paid $.47 per disk so I will live with 2.4X for that price. Still feel like I've been cheated though...
2,2.4x and not 4x MSI-DR4A with 2.06 Bios,They are only burning at 2.4x on my MSI-DR4A and I flashed the bios to the latest update today just to make sure. Pity.
5,A Great Ride,"I love having this CD in my car in the Morning, it starts me off with a positive HIGH!I have been listening and learning with these types of tapes for over 10 years, it makes 128 bearable in the AM!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I had a person out to my house to repair a leather car seat; he recommeded this product to treat my furniture. I found that it takes the color out of my furniture upon testing it in a small spot. I now have a full bottle of product I cannot use as it strips the color from the leather. I had heard great things about the product from this person; beware, it may or may not work for you."
4,Restored some shoes,"yep, I used this and the conditioner to clean and restore a pair of dress shoes that I had left covered in mud for about 2 years. After some polish I couldn't tell just how much abuse I had put those damn shoes through"
3,Not good for stains,"Maybe it is good for cleaning lightly soiled leather, but it does't work very well with ground in dirt and stains. I gave up using it, but, it is good to clean leather before treating it with conditioner."
5,Sweet and Romantic,"A very sweet, and very witty romantic comedy but no, not a remake of Alan Rudolph's ""Made in Heaven."" Very good performances and a smart script make this a very refreshing watch."
5,Die Prinzen sind echt cool!,"Unlike many pop groups today, Die Prinzen can actually SING! And the songs are all upbeat and fun to listen to. My favorites are ""Mein Bester Freund"" and ""Gabi und Klaus"". Even if you don't speak German, you'll love listening to this C.D."
3,had what we needed,Bought for my 9 yr old child's science project. It had everything we needed. My child enjoyed taking the mummy apart and performing the mummification process
4,Read it TODAY!,One of the best books i have ever read.did not take me long to finish. it is beter than the store price wants it. i cant wate to get another one. Read it TODAY!
4,Underrated recording with terriffic vocals,"This recording has received a bad reputation because of the so-called ""disco"" and pop element.What disco is present, sounds more like Funkadelic or Parliament, than the Bee Gees.The pop element has strong Latin tinges to it.Unlike Zebop, (see my review), the vocals and production are superior. There is more a lively performance than in Zebop. Unlike Zebop, this bargain CD reprints everything from the LP.It is an underrated recording. It gets only 4 stars for a Santana recording, but would get 5 stars for disco or pop recording.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
2,recycled comerciality,This album was sad to me because Santana was trying to be trendy with dance numbers on one hand and jazzy numbers on the other.Stay away from late seventies Santana.
3,Not the same as the original.,"A favorite album many years ago, couldn't wait to listen to it and one song in particular, ""One Chain"". The version of this song on the CD is NOT the same as the original; much softer, longer, with none of the edgy guitar riffs that made it such a favorite. Great album, but pretty bummed out that the main reson for buying it (""One Chain"") isn't what it should have been."
2,It was great for a while,"This Camera worked great for my needs; family pictures, scenic views, etc. I was dissappointed that it didnt have optical zoom, but that was my fault. It lasted for about a year and then malfuntioned on several occassions for several months. I turn it on and the screen is grey and lines are going all over it. It's too bad it couldnt have lasted longer for 200 dollars."
1,Arachniphobes beware,"If you are afraid of spiders DON'T buy this book. I wasn't aware the murder weapon was poisonous spiders. I never would have touched the book. I am really afraid of spiders: a phobia, I know. I had it too long before I started it to return the kindle version, that option isn't available. I got a few pages into the first chapter and was so freaked out by the spiders I removed the book from my library.I have no idea how well it's written, but the prologue seemed a bit pompous to me."
3,Bizzare,"I found The Killing Kind an interesting read.I was intriqued, at first,to see where the author was going, but towards the end was looking forward to the book ending."
5,Awesome pocket size camera!,"I just got the Minolta G600 and love how easy it is to use. I take pix mostly on vacation and wanted something sturdy yet small enough to carry with me. Menu options are very easy to use - start up is quick, and the pix have turned out great. Not alot of confusing buttons/wheels to learn - very easy. You will love it."
1,Still waiting,"I purchaced this magazine for my daughter on 3/29/07, and it is now 5/13/07. We still have not received it. My credit card was charged right away, but still no magazine. The delivery date goes all the way until June 19, but come on, how long does it take to send out a magazine, there is no packaging involved. I wish that I would have continued to buy them from the store. I also puchased a fish magazine at the same time, and received that right away. I guess the kid mags are in higher demand."
1,had cancelled,It was ordered by accident and cancelled and one copy came I glanced thru it and was glad that I cancelled it
4,Fun times!,Bought this on a whim. It was a great find. My kids love to paint their faces and bodies but I don't like the mess of pallette paints and markers can be hard to wash off. The book has fun ideas for hand puppets and faux jewelery. There is a sharpener provided and the crayons have lasted a while now. I haven't paid attention to the rubbing off and if it has then the kids have cleaned it up or it has been washed out of clothes so I don't see that as a con to the product. The colors are pretty and they are easily applied. The directions suggest lotioning the area before applying as it makes the crayons work better but I know that the kids skip that step usually.
5,most interesting and helpful,"I checked this out at the library and decided I had to have a copy! I have referred to this book many times and it has been right on the mark (for me,at least). It's most interesting and fun to read.The recipes and instructions are fun and quite effective. Pat F."
4,I will buy more of Mr. Rankin's work.,"The first chapter is a grueling shock. If one reads on, you discover a varied plot with oblique threads that do eventually result in a first-class read. My Rankin is a very good writer; I will buy more."
4,"Not my favourite, but still good","I found this book's plot to be a bit loose and disjointed and it left some unanswered questions. It alsohad me questioning how we got to a particular point at times. But the Rebus character is still great. I like the way Rankin depicts his uncertainties and foibles. While we read of these we never lose sight of the fact that he is a very brilliant copper. I didn't much care for one of the villains in this book and I didn't like how that particular thread was left at the end of the book because I really don't want to see this particular villain again. Anyway, the book is worth reading because it is part of this very remarkable series. I love watching Rebus as he faces and conquers his many demons. And I love the underworld look at modern-day Edinburgh. Oh, and be prepared for a zinger at the end of the book. Rankin always has these in his books."
4,True grit,"After all the readable but increasingly outlandish thrillers by Patricia Cornwell, P.D. James, Nelson DeMille et al that I've read and enjoyed over recent years, it's a pleasant surprise to come across a writer as gritty as Rankin (a bit like a Scottish James Ellroy). His dialogue leaps off the page and rings in your ears, while the labyrinthine plotting keeps you reading well after bed-time. A great deal of the force of this novel comes from the fact that Rebus is a ""human"" character with his failings and foibles. I'm definitely going to read more of Rankin's stuff."
5,Timex Watch,"This watch was a Christmas present. It arrived in plenty of time, and in perfect condition. The recipient was very pleased."
5,Mastering the AP Spanish Language,"I've been reading a chapter a day preparing for the exam and I, too, have found this to be the best guide. A friend from last year offered me the REA guide and that is dry. Mastering the AP Spanish is a great buy and I recommend it. The chapters are about 30 pages each but aren't boring at all. It covers everything and the authors give tips on what the AP writers' favorites tricks and such. Overall: better than other test prep books."
4,First book ever written on the history of water-powered cars!,"James A. Robey wrote this book six months after opening the world's first Water Fuel Museum, in Lexington, KY. He has researched the suppressed history of this awesome technology thoroughly, and his enthusiasm for the subject shows. He has acquired one of the few documented water-powered cars ever made, and includes with the book a DVD of interviews with water fuel device inventors, as well as a CD of plans for some of the more popular water fuel devices. While not claiming to be a step by step manual for building a water-powered car, it does contain the information needed for a do-it-yourselfer to get started making his own economical, non-polluting fuel from water."
3,Water Car by Rodey,A gift for a friend and there interest with turning water into fuel and the saving in money and pollution!
3,"Not a bad book, but not what I thought it was . . .","This is a story of a woman in Canada who struggled with her husband's hemochromatosis treatment and did a lot of good along the way by creating an international organization to get info out to doctors and patients about this common disease (one in about every 200 people has it). It is not much a guide to how to treat the disease accept as it fits in the story above. I was thinking this was a guide to how to live with this disease, but it actually has not too much about that, though it is mentioned nearer the end of the book."
5,Credit After Bankruptcy,Very usefull book!! Really helps you recover both financially and emotionally from this stressfull time of your life. I highly recommend this book and if you get a chance to go to his seminar...GO!
4,Well worth the money,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this book but to skip over the authors opinions (religious or otherwise). I highly recommend if you are skeptical due to the less favorable reviews to do the same. It has provided me with a completely new outlook on my financial future (which I thought was doomed) as well as educated me on credit reports and FICO scores (something I had always dreaded in fear that my reports/scores would be horrendous - which they actually were not)."
2,Roitman reviews Kathryn,"well, kathryn didn't quite get the gist of it. She plays excessively on the conservative side rather that really getting that piano to have free expression. Why didn't she just wham it out like George wanted her to. Too pretty, not the revolutionary kind of playing that Gershwin gave license to. Still, she has skill and I enjoyed it. But not an investment grade George Gershwin for me. Irwin Roitman"
1,ashley is nothing like Shirley!!!!!!!!,"I don't want to offend Shirley Temple(shes my favorite actress), but I did not like this movie at all. I have read Child Star, and the movie is nothing like the book! Plus, Ashley Orr did a terrable job as Shirley! Shirley had a differant, yet very cute, voice, which ashley does not have, and by trying to copy Shirley's voice she made it worse! If you want to know more about Shirley, then read Child Star, by Shirley Temple; Shirley Temple American Princess, by Anne Edwards; Or watch one of the real Shirley Temple movies. DON'T buy this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I Love Shirley Temple, But I HATE this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Pretty Awful,"This movie was awful! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than Temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as the Shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her on screen or off screen persona. So what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If one wants to see that side of her, one can just watch one of her movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrayal of Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. The Poor Little Rich Girl is definitely a better investment."
1,Peee uuuu!,"I wasnt expecting perfection from a Pixar knock-off, but at least show some class. The jokes were trashy and many had sexual references that surprised me, since it it geared at kids. The characters were overly cliche and very annoying. The main character had a very low-self esteem in regard to his love interest. I understand that many kids movies have subtle jokes/references geared at adults. The key word is ""subtle"".Thats all I know because I turned it off after 10-15 minutes. Also there was a plot error - on the box it says the ""champion hasnt lost a race in 8 years"", but in the movie the # of years is different. I guess they skimped on editors... and everything else about the movie.Guess I could use the disk as a coaster."
4,Little cars 1,"I brought this for my three year old grandson. His father says he loves it. My son says the quality of the animation leaves a little to be desired. But it wasn't meant for him. As long as my grandson enjoys it,that's all I ask."
1,All about abortion loss,"Although other types of loss are meanioned, it seems the goal of this book is to focus on abortion loss and how people who have lost a child through miscarriage, still birth or early infant loss should feel bad for those who aborted their children. Although I can see this being a good book if you have had an abortion and are mourning the loss of that child, I found this book very upsetting and not helpful at all in dealing with the death of my child (since his death had nothing to do with abortion, nor did I want to focus on how I could be sympathetic to someone who chose not to have their child while dealing with the sudden death of my very wanted child)."
5,Highly Recommended,"This book and the scriptures referenced in it are a great comfort to those who have lost a baby or know someone who has. There are not many resources that deal with the death of infants and stillborn children. This is the most complete one I have seen and I have given it to parents suffering through the such a tragedy. Hayford in discussing this specific subject sheds a good deal of light on the subject of heaven in general. It is a small book that can be read in a short time, important to parents who are suffering."
5,Wonderful,This book brings grace and hope to those who have lost a child or had an abortion and reveals the greatness of God's love in difficult circumstances.It can be life-changing for women.
5,"""I'll Hold You in Heaven""",This is a MUST READ for anyone who has ever lost a baby (including those who have been aborted). It says all of the right things just when you need to hear them most.
3,"Good book, badly made","The book is fine, my kids like using it. But is very badly made and falls apart, I bought 3 books and they all have cover coming off and pages falling out!"
3,No Zoom?,"Great Product... Decent Picture, very portable. Not as high quality as an actual camcorder, but does the job. Couldn't find any way to zoom, which to me, is kinda important."
3,great movie,this movie came to me in the condition they described and played very smoothly. The product was in excellent condition.
5,delicious!,"I bought these sky bars for my husband who was nostolgic about the old seven up bars. While they don't have all the flavors inclued in those, the flavors in this bar are delicious! It's like getting 4 kinds of chocolate bar in one."
2,Only for New Age devotees.,"I am going to give this 2 stars instead of only one and only because, not being a New Age believer, I may be being unduly harsh with my criticism. I just have a hard time with this whole Self Help genre.Truthfully, I only read half the book. Pfff! It never caught my interest. It starts out with an explanation of your Lower Self and your Higher Self as if the evidence of the existence of either is indisputable. Then we move into the obligatory ""positive affirmations"", physically cleaning out our closets, joining 12 step programs, choosing not to be a victim, meditating, praying, tai chi and on and on.If you feel that any of this may help you Dance with Life, then I admire your faith. Me, I'll just continue to refill my prescription for Prozac."
1,The PC game on the market,"I bought this game from an Office Depot and needless to say, they refused to give me a refund after opening the package. I wasted $20 on this crap and please don't do the same. The game is so slow, my mouse was always at least 5 seconds behind my last movement and it never moved fluently...I'm not making this up, this will drive you nutts. I couldn't even complete one hand of poker before I took the game out of my computer and uninstalled it. There is no excuse for software gliches like that. Oh yeah, it took almost 30 minutes to download, what PC game takes 30 minutes to download?...Finally, the ""create a character"" mode only has about 4 different body types and 4 different faces....All of the faces look like 40 yr old axe murderers and old fat ladies. This GAME SUCKS...DON'T EVER BUY IT...I just left mine at the office depot customer service desk, I don't care what they do with it....Just don't buy it."
1,I wouldnt buy it again!!,"This product didn't work AT ALL for my son. He had on a temp cast we put the bag over his cast, when we got out of the pool the bag was filled with water half way. I was ringing his cast out and had a blow dryer to it all night. The part that sucked most was I had bought two bag so I would have an extra and we never opened the other box. I could return it but I am terrible about getting things in the mail. so a complete waste of money. We ended up buying 3m water proof casting padding, when he got his hard cast on we just got him a water proof cast so we wouldn't have to worry about it. and that stuff works great!"
1,Misses the point,"I broke my wrist. I'm down to one hand, but I still need to bathe regularly. I bought this thinking that with it, I could wash my own hair. It came in 2 days as promised from Amazon.com. There were no directions for use in the box, so I googled it. Basically, you have to stretch the tiny opening over a huge cast---with one hand. I called the 800 number hoping for a logical and reasonable way to use this product. The person on the phone not only was unhelpful, she was rude and patronizing. She said that if I couldn't do it myself, I'd have to get help from someone. The whole point of the product is so another person isn't needed...if I had someone to help me, I could save myself $25 and use trash bags and duct tape, or just have them wash my hair. A wasteful and frustrating purchase. Don't encourage this company by contributing to its profits."
5,DELICIOUS,"I read Scarpetta's Winter Table in about one hour --immediately went shopping and last night had the marvelous Holiday pizza for dinner and today made Lucy's Felonious cookies--yum--both were a great hit and believe me you don't need to have exact amounts to make them. This book was great and I can see each one of the character's as they indulged in their cooking--My favoite part of the novelette, though, was Marino and the little boy--Jimmy--Thanks--Patricia for another great book---By the way as my pizza crust rose I started Black Notice."
1,Works like this will ruin the Cornwell franchise,"Not a cookbook, this ""novella"" lacks a point and a plot. Cornwell must have put this together in about 3 hours. The kid is so saccharin sweet that I wonder if Cornwell has ever been near a real child. Lucy is portrayed so poorly here her character just seems to prove that Cornwell MUST get high. Which brings me to Cornwell's only area of detail: the alcohol. I guess we know the author's favorite course. I can't see who the book would appeal to. Not fans of thrillers or crime novels, since nothing happens. Not fans/users of cookbooks, since there are no real recipes. Maybe the die-hard Cornwell fans who fail to notice that this author is worsening with every book. A complete waste of money."
3,Decent Skin Case,"Bought this to save some money. It's not the best skin in the world, but it does the job. Good skin for the price."
2,Decent for a certain audience,"I am planning my wedding and find some of the tips and readings useful. The author mentions that she can not give practical advice regarding a timeline for wedding planning because it is a very personal thing, yet I find myself planning my wedding according to the schedule of the site and the photographer! It is truly the most impersonal part of the wedding planning. The tips are useful for those who are on a budget and not worried about etiquette (tupperware parties for a shower? A potluck for the reception?) I also found a lot of grammatical errors which distracted me from the content of the book."
2,Not very deep,"A very superficial review of technology and medicine. If you would like to read about one or two coming technologies in visualization and early detection, you will have to cut through about half the book to get at it. Otherwise, you may find it frustrating that Kessler tries to convert every life science issue he encounters into technology investment banking terms. The conclusion that we are on the brink of a major breakthrough which may make traditional medicine obsolete is quite a stretch."
2,Why?,"I would consider myself to be a BIG mudhoney fan, but this album is rubbish. They seem to have lost all the vibrancy which made me love them 6 years or so ago. Mark just drones on, Stevie never really lets rip, and Dan and Matt are simply filling in space. I never thought it would happen, but this particular album is a dirge."
1,Not a Romance,How this book ever got called a romance book I will never know. Half way through the book the boy and girl still had not met much less kissed! And when they do meet Adam stay around for a few days and then poof he's dead. Now tell me what kind of romance is that!? If I had not been stuck on a plane I never would have finished reading this book.
2,2 stars.,"There is something distant in the telling of this story that makes getting involved in the action, and thus caring what happens to those involved problematic. It is the story of two souls, separated by distance, Justine and Adam, who are in love though they have never actually met in this life. They have in others though, and are destined to again. Yet, their love is shadowed by doom, by a cycle they are destined to repeat again and again. If you like reincarnation romances and don't find them basically offensive, then perhaps you will have better luck with this novel."
4,And next week he'll be eighteen,"This very well plotted and very well drawn black-and-white graphic novel is about a couple of young wannabe punks in a retro-futuristic Britain where Hovers are like motorcycles with antigrav plates instead of wheels, where a huge protective dome over a reservoir also provides an enormous recreation area, where the Originals and the Dirt are violently rival gangs not unlike the Mods and the Rockers of the early 1960s. Lel and his black buddy, Bok, make it into the gang and are introduced to drugs as well as the lifestyle they yearn for -- until an encounter with the Dirt gets out of hand. The characterization is quite good, the dialogue is believable, and there's actually a Beginning, a Middle, and an End -- unlike so many graphic novels."
1,not great,they just did not feel right when chopping vegies and were not very attractive to have sitting on my counter
2,Was Good for the First Few Weeks...,"Was Good for the First Few Weeks... Then one of the Knives got Rusted, I Posted the Pic... The Other Knives are Fine so Far... My Mom said this shouldn't Happen to Good Quality Stainless Steal."
4,Ginsu Knife Set,"I bought this set since we had worn out the set we received 14 years ago when I got married. I am happy with the set and the low price of the set. The knives work well and seem to be of higher quality than the price would suggest. Only time will tell how long they will last, but I think for sure I will get a ton of use out of the set."
4,Decent knives,"They're still cutting after a year of usage.The one non-serrated santoku knife is the one I use the most, and is the best general-purpose knife in the set.The paring knife and bread-slicing(?) knife are the next best knives. Serrating these both make sense.The tip of the handle of my chef's knife broke off during regular usage, so I use it sparingly -- mainly for cutting tough vegetables. Because it's serrated, it doesn't really work that well for cutting meats anyway. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong, but when I use serrated knives to cut meat, I get tears/strings. It's much easier to use the Santoku knife.My ex-roommate took the shears when he left, so I didn't get much use out of them. They seemed okay though."
5,awesome,I absolutely love my knives!! I have shopped around for a while looking for a good set and finally decided on these and boy am I glad I did. They are well worth the money I spent on them.
5,Sharpest Knives Anywhere,This set is a must to have zips through whatever you want it to do. I recommend this product for every cooking pleasure.
5,Fantastic Knife set,Nothing bad to say about this product so just a simply 5-star rating for a great product.Whatever you do DO NOT put these in the dishwasher otherwise that nice black look will go dull straight away. I was aware of this but girlfriend forgot I had mentioned this :-(
3,This is not what I received,"This product seems fine so far, but the knife block that I received is black and the knives do not say ginsu on them, nor does the block. I'm not entirely sure how this happened, but this is not the product I ordered. Obviously, they do the same general thing, but they are not ginsu knives."
1,RUST in all of them (Stainless Steel? yeah sure),"Rust quickly, all of them.The knives advertise stainless steel, but they clearly are notDo not buy them.Product: Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural"
3,Decent set,"I only give them three stars because they are not high quality and rust easily. But if you take good care of them, and keep them sharp, they'll last a few years."
5,GREAT KNIFE SET,"This knife set is really great, it is very sharp and the Santoku is great for cutting vegetables, etc. I had not used one before and find it cuts the work in half, plus you can easily cut really thin if you need to. Very happy with this purchase."
4,A great bargain,"Just received this knife set and was very pleased with the quality of the set and the block. The knives clean up very well and are extrememly sharp. They are a nice weight to work with, also. Would recommend it for an all purpose set of knives."
3,Not the best choice for people who chop a lot of vegetables.,"I cook a lot of stir fry's to bring to work for lunch, and let me tell you, it takes more effort to chop a ton of vegetables day in and day out with a serrated edge in comparison to a straight edge. For the price, it would be a good buy though; just plan on updating if you do some intense chopping."
2,Beware when washing!,"I have gotten this set and although it looks nice, you must keep the supposedly STAINLESS set very very dry at all times, otherwise you get rusty spots. I have hand washed these and placed them to dry with the rest. The Ginsu are the only ones who got rusty spots. I even tried a couple on a dishwasher to see if it would do any better but it was the same (the Dishwasher actually dried them better but it didn't fix the problem).I am considering throwing the entire set because of this. Really, you don't want rusty spots in your knives!I took a photo to demonstrate how bad it is, but Amazon won't let me place links.Despite that, the knives and the whole set is nice, and if you don't have anything it ought to be a nice starting (and cheap) point. But I'd recommend looking elsewhere due to the above problem."
4,Good Knife Set,"I had a bunch of knives sitting in the drawer. I wanted something to organize and safe ways from kid's reach but, not too expensive either. This knife set seems to great for the price. Knives are sharp and cut through fruits and vegetables effortlessly. Ginsu claims (on the box) that blades will stay sharp for long time and they use same technology to make these knives as Japanese use in making Samurai swords."
4,good value,"These knives are very sharp and cut well. The handles become dull after the first couple of washings, but they are perfectly fine otherwise. Not really sure if the ""never needs sharpening"" bit is true, but at this price you can buy a new set a few times a year and not worry about it."
5,Knife Set,This is a great purchase for us. We had a set before for more than 20 years. These knives are as just like the original ginsu knives that we still use. I would recommend them.
4,Good knives will require some maintenance,"I have had these knives for about 4 months, using it almost daily on wooden and glass cutting boards. The only knife that has worn noticeably dull is the one non-serrated butcher knife (frequently used). I suspect this is normal wear and tear and a sharpening session would do the trick.Pro-tip: Store your knives upside-down in the block to prevent gravity from wearing down blades!"
3,Acceptable-Not Great,Being a stickler for sharp knives- I purchased this Ginsu knife set. I found it acceptable but not great. The smaller knives are better than the large knives but still not great. The set looks nice on the counter but I probably would not buy it again.
3,Surprised!,"The knives came in a beautiful and sturdy box, and all the knives came individually wrapped -- plus taped. But I was surprised that the block was not taped & sealed. Also, I was looking for instructions to keep and review. So for those reasons I returned. The second one they sent me was packaged the exact same way -- without instructions. So I'm looking at the description of the knives on Amazon (which is great), and will check out their website. Although it would have been nice to have a handy description on care & maintenance to keep instead of just the info on the box.Also, the second block was not as well stained as the first one sent, but I will keep it. All that said -- the product looks nice, compared to the expensive ones. I like the idea of not having to sharpen the knives. No wooden handles, but I'll give these a go for sure!"
3,Missing pieces,I was happy with how fast I recieved the knives! However I was upset that the scissors were missing out of the set! They are nice and sharp!
4,Sharp and good quality,"Not sure what to say about these. They look good, sharp, holder looks nice. I have used them for about 2 weeks now (for opening packages and cutting holes in wood) and they seem sturdy."
4,Very good so far!,"Although i've had it for a little time, the knives are great, still sharp, and i guess their gonna be durable as well. The cost was great and the quality maintains."
4,Good knives,"I am pleased so far with this knife set, was delivered in a timely manner. I would recommend."
2,Wrong Guns,"The action and story for this movie is okay but hard to believe that it's supposed to be a Civil War movie. To me the biggest flaw is the guns that they are carrying. Almost all the handguns are 1873 Colt .45 revolvers which obviously weren't produced until 1873. Near the beginning of the movie there's two 1873 Winchester rifles that also are from almost 10 years later. It would have been better if they had Colt or Remington percussion revolvers, although the South used revolvers manufactured by companies like Griswold & Gunnison and Leech & Rigdon. The only repeating rifles during this era were Henry rifles, which came out in 1860 but only the North could afford them. So if you're a blackpowder buff or enjoy historically accurate firearms in a Western movie, you won't like this..."
4,Lawyer Finds Book Useful,"As an attorney specializing in estate planning for 17 years, I found some good ideas in this book. However, there are a number of statements that are misleading at best and flat-out wrong (from a technical legal and tax standpoint), at worst. Still, your lawyer should be able to spot those and it's still a very worthwhile book, on the whole."
1,Now Sustained Release doesn't prevent flushing,"The purpose of the ""Sustained Release"" type of Niacin is to prevent the unpleasant side effects of flushing caused by Niacin. However, I almost always experience flushing with the Now Sustained Release brand, and I haven't found this with other brands. So I will not buy the Now brand again.Some reviewers have noted success with Flush Free versions of Niacin. There are several articles on the internet stating that flush free versions may not be effective, as it appears that the molecular structures of the flush free versions are not easily absorbed in the body."
3,CARDHOLDER,"The cardholder was purchased for a gift and was well-constructed, however the large debossed ""GENUINE LEATHER"" in the lower right corner (not shown in item pictures) was not favored by the recipient, and this item has been returned."
4,Good buy,"Shipping was quick. although the cost of the item with shipping is higher than the value of the item IMO. It is very useful; keeps four cards and miscellaneous items in the middle pocket like cash, receipts etc. I got this use with a small cross body bag for traveling it has worked nicely."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Needed a leather card holder / front pocket wallet.Only reason I bought this one was the the price and the overwhelming number of positive reviews it got. What came in the mail matched what was in the picture alright...To put my disappointment mildly, calling this wallet genuine leather is like calling Charlie Sheen a role model. If I could give this Zero stars I would.Shopped around amazon a bit more and found this:Saddleback Leather Wallet Small"
5,"awesome!! very small, slim and handy! good quality too","I have a medium size bag and a very small one for when I go out, my purse is pretty heavy and big and does not fit my little bag. I wanted a credit card holder so I could easily transfer my important cards from one bag to another, and not have my cards loose in my smaller bag. This card holder is of good quality, remains very thin despite all the cards and bills I'm fitting in (ID, student ID,credit card, transport cards, bills). Each side has 2 slots, and there is a space in the middle for a few bills I honestly don't think it can be thinner. Extremely happy with the purchase, in particular for that price! The shipping was prompt and the item was delivered in a few days only. I highly recommend it!!!"
5,Cheap and effective,"My new wallet (this holder), fully loaded is now 1/2"" x 2.75"" x 4"". Very nice. Barely noticeable when I keep it in my front pocket.I have in it: 2 proximity cards, 3 credit cards, ID, cash (and a check I need to deposit).I would have preferred it to be just a tad wider so that I could keep folded business checks in there awaiting deposit.I solved my problem by simply cutting the thread for the middle pocket on one side (like the Slim Slimmy). So far the outer pockets are staying together, but if they were using the same thread, I can re-stitch then myself."
4,slim,"Works good. it can be hard to get items or money out of center pocket, I use it for other items like mini cards etc, but its not that much of an issue considering how much i get into that pocket. It is very slim but I only carry 3 cards in it total and 1 mini card in center pocket with cash. Good product for the money"
4,Cute little credit card/ID holder,"Bought this for my daughter to use as an ID holder. It works great -- small size, well-made, great price. Seller shipped out quickly."
2,too small and uncomfortable,My driving license barely made it in and almost never made it out. Maybe with time it becomes more flexible but I didn't like it or find it comfortable.
1,"Looks nice, feels awful","I always buy Daniel Green Dormie slippers, but when I could not get them in my size and color, I bought these.They are very attractive,but after wearing them for awhile, the tops of my feet became very painful. They also causes a corn. Had to throw them out."
3,Dont last,Less than 2 years old it will run for a three seconds and diethe repair was going to cost 150 plusI will just buy another one instead...
2,Frustrating/Hard to follow,Although this looks like a great workout it is almost impossible to follow. The moves do not look that difficult but she switches between them so incredibly fast that I just could not keep up. I wish she would stick to one move or one routine a little but longer and then I might get the hang of it. I feel as though I wasted my money on this one. :(
3,A bit disappointed in this one,"As someone who owns about 15 other Firm DVDS, I decided to give this one a try since I am looking for shorter workouts for my busy days. I usually love Emily as an instructor, but for whatever reason, she just does not cue well during this workout. I am very well practiced and familiar with The Firm an found myself a bit lost during the majority of this workout. Also, the name of the workout that Emily introduces and talks about at the beginning of the video is not titled ""Power Half Hour"". It's ""Lunchtime"" something or other. I am going to give this one a few more tries to see if I pick up the moves before writing it off completely."
2,Out of Sync,"I can see that this workout would be very effective if I could follow it! This girl has bad rhythm... she's not in sync with the music half the time... and the moves are not repeated enough for those of us who are not dancers to be able to catch on. Once she starts a sequence, it ends so quickly and she moves on to something else and I'm still left behind trying to figure out the other move. All the FIRM workouts are great, but this one should have been edited better before being released."
1,Instructor moves to fast,"I did not like this workout the instructor moves too fast and goes from one move to another way too soon.I wish I did not waste my money on this dvd because I am sure I will not use it, because it is too difficult to learn the moves."
3,"Great story, but poor quality book.","We love this story, we have it on audio book & listen to it over again in the car. But this edition is very poor quality. the paper is cheap and most of the pages were stuck together. buy this story, but find another edition."
3,Ehhh...,Well what can I say but that this CD is pretty boring. Not one of his best. Mostly long boring stories that really did not do anything for me. I'd recommend you pick up his other books or CD's that are much better.
1,I'm not understanding,"One issue that is never addressed by ""cultural conservatives"" is the issue of language in the argument of influence. The language of the people of ancient Egypt was similar to other African languages, not Greek, and not Arabic. It is a matter of fact that Arabs could not speak Egyptian when they first entered Africa. This collection of ""essays"" does not address the real issue."
1,You can't deny the truth,"Why do whites want to separate Egypt from Africa so bad. Egypt is in Africa and the ancient Egyptians were African just as the Greeks and Romans are Europeans. It is a fact. I feel sorry for those of you who deny the truth. Although you perpetuate a legacy of falsified European history, I am satisfied because, ""the truth is like lightening with its errand done."" Centuries from now (or even sooner) historians will give Africa the credit that it is due. You can't erase facts or the past."
4,good book,"I read this book in common library.This book is very helpful to understand new media in many perspective.I need this book very much to help me to teach my student to understanding media technology, history and current issue.I wish I can buy this book."
