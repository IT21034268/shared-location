2,"Not for 18"" dolls!!!","I just did a search for 18"" doll beds and this one came up. I already own this one and it IS NOT for 18"" dolls. WAYYY too small for 18"" dolls. If you need a bed for an 18"" doll, do not buy this one. Otherwise it's cute..maybe for a barbie-size doll. I ordered it for an 18"" doll and was very dissappointed that it was advertised as an 18"" doll bed when it is definitely not."
5,Perfect for little girls (and mommies too),"My daughter and I both think the Groovy Girls are waaaay groovy and oh so beautiful. The bunk beds have proven themselves to be extremely durable. My 50 lb. daughter sat on them a few times while stacked before I caught her. They withstood her weight and maltreatment without suffering any apparent damage. By the way, the canopy is gorgeous and very fun too--we just got one canopy to go atop the bunk beds vs. one for each, and it's worked out great. These are pricey, but the quality, creative beauty, and durability is worth it. Some day when my daughter is tired of them, I hope she'll let me have them. :)"
5,Great,Love all Lee Harris Books. Does anyone know her real name. Would like to read her other books.
3,OK,"I am decorating a diaper cake to match the baby bedding my sister has chosen for her son, and I needed an elephant that was small. The pickings are slim - so I settled for this guy. He's exactly what the description says, and in fact, when i opened the packaging, he was cuter than in the picture. But still not the cutest elephant out there. Of course, if you collect beanie babies i'm sure he's perfect for you!"
5,Great recording of a great symphony,"This is a very good recording of Mahler's sixth. It was my first time hearing the piece, and it left me in awe. The New York Philharmonic's playing is very good, and the sound quality is wonderful. I am liking this even more with every listen."
2,Very excessive,"I bought this CD based on the recommendation here. I found it to be too excessive for me. I had a very hard time listening to it. I queried a very knowledgeable friend of mine who, when I told him I had this one, immediately mentioned that it was very excessive - also for him. (He has many recordings of Mahler and has conducted him as well.) I am guessing that Bernstein with the Vienna is a good recording.I subsequently bought Boulez and the Vienna. Very, very good - maybe a little too controlled in the last movement. I am open to getting another rendition that is a little more passionate in the last movement - but with the clarity of Boulez."
3,Nice Product but NEEDS BETTER DIRECTIONS!,"This is my second Cateye computer and I've had good luck as far as durability and performance.Navigating the various features is not intuitive, compared to my old Sigma computer which was pretty straight forward. Cateyes are a little clunky in the operation. (For example, just try to find the time-of-day clock. It's there but you'll need instructions to find it.)My biggest gripe with Cateye: the written directions with the unit are TERRIBLE! Plan to go to Cateye.com support for answers. For example, the written directions with the product don't tell you how to enter your wheel's circumference .... which is critical to all the other features!Why Cateye doesn't fix this problem is beyond me."
5,Undeniably awesome,I'm writing this review on 4th Sept 08 six years after first hearing this album and still hering something new every single time I put the cd on.With modern soul/hip hop gone off the deep end and neo-soul lost in the wilderness this is a breath of fresh air.Every single track delivers and though you may not agree with all Michelle's sentiments the cohesiveness and eclectic sensibility of the album makes it encyclopedic in scope.This is definitely the most intriguing album in my collection.I love to put it on as a conversation piece when friends come over.If you don't already have it please go out right now and pick it up!
4,Are you a courageous listener?,"It is remarkable that a woman so obviously talented can exist virtually unnoticed by mainstream urban radio. ""Cookie"" is an ambitious project and worthy of her reputation as one of the premier bassists of any gender. The topics are unique and provocative, and the exploration of those topics are typically unflinching."
5,Meshells best album to date,On her past album shes been singing her head off and im glad she now has dedicated herself to spoken word the best songs on this album are dead nigga blvd 1 and pocketbook remix on bitter i couldnt stand her singing or anything but on this its so funky and she adresses many diffrent topics like politics and the etc........ She is a queen on her own terms dispite shes a you know lezbian she still is a very beautiful women inside and i hope she finds her true source of happiness.
2,Yawn,"Very bad poetry and I have gotten sick and tired of her complaining and her bitterness towards the world.Black is the only color her music makes.This album is depressing and their is nothing on this album you can shake your rump to. Boy, people have forgotten how to make tracks that move the body. There is too much bad poetry on this album for me to enjoy it.Hopefully this is her last album."
2,overrated,"I purchased this as an LP when it was first released and had fond memories of it. In retrospect, it seems a bit slight and not particularly deep. The songs are smooth but not all that deep. The passage of time has not been kind to this album."
5,The best!,"I was a little nervous buying such a new product that had no reviews out yet, but this washer is great! I can fit SO MANY clothes in it, it is awesome. This washer cleans my clothes better than they have ever been, and it fits a ton of clothes.If you are in the market for a new washer, definitely buy this one"
1,Why was this reissued?,"Luckily, I only blew about seven bucks on this CD. I can't figure out why this was reissued, although it probably has to do the the big names involved. The vocal performances are not only rough around the edges, but rather under-characterized. But they are spectacular compared with the string performances, which can be described as amateurish at best."
3,"Good value for money, but not great quality.","I had this radio a year before it stopped working. The sound quality was good, and I liked the simplicity of of the design. The customer service at Emerson definitely has room for improvement however, and after dealing with them I don't think I'll buy another radio from them. I'm willing to pay a little more for a radio that will last longer and come with good customer service."
1,you get what you pay for,"I have two of these radios and both have the same problem--the AM/FM switch allows both bands at first but soon, only FM will hold its tuning. I have returned one to the company but the replacement had the same flaw, If you only want FM, its not bad for the price---but what about Rush Limbaugh?"
5,Epic Zappa.,"This is one of my all-time favorite Zappa albums.My son, who is a band leader, agrees, and he regularly does Zappa covers, including many from this album (which we both consider to be Frank's best). You cannot find a better finale the ""Son of Orange County / More Trouble Every Day"", although this was not the closer of the set. Frank was an amazing player, a perfectionista of a performer, and a true stage persona and all-around epic performer. Just a shout out to Dweezil: You have gotta go see them play because they present Frank's music with virtuosity and love.Frank, we miss you dearly.Thanks for the great music! WE LOVE YOU!"
5,my all time favourite album,"I bought this album when I was a kid, only 14, 21 years ago. This is the only album I find important enough to buy two times (in CD format now, of course). To those who think ""popular"" music can't be ""classical"" I dare ask ""should an album one has lissened to about once a week during 20 years not be considered as ""classical""? A lot of stuff from this album is played also on the YCDTOS vol 2 (Helsinko concert), but in Helsinki it is played at a higher tempo, and sounds less yazzy. If jou've never heard ""Roxy"", you're to young to die."
3,"rendering fashion, fabric and print w/ adobe illustrator",the book is not well organized and for an experience designer not of any usage.
1,Sadly disappointing,"Normally I'm a big fan of Rebecca Winters and have been since some of her early work. However, I found this book to be a real disappointment. I did not read the first book in the series and don't feel I lost out - although characters were clearly carried over, the story was ok as a stand-alone. Unfortunately, the author seemed to spend so much time creating ""unique"" individuals, that they never seemed to connect with each other. The heroine's implied personality change (from what she had been like before the start of the book) was largely unexplained and as a result, was more confusing then interesting as a plot point. Finally, while love scenes can certainly be left at the bedroom door, it seems highly unrealistic that two adults who are legally married and in theory fighting a great attraction for one another would not further their relationship.Overall, the characters did not come together for me."
2,Culligan RFC=BBS Cartridge,"When I first was looking at this item, I thought it was going to be a better buy than the normal GE filters that came with our system.. We have some sulpher in our well water and tried the Ge filters, but were not happy with the taste. Then I read the reviews on this filter and how long it seemed to last with the tast and odors, BUT, we have only had this in about a month and the taste and smell are back.....And granted we had our water tested, and there were just a small amount of sulphur.."
4,Works Great for a private well,I am on the cartridge refill program at a 90 day interval and it seems to work great. My water tastes better than it ever has and filters out all of the sand before it reaches my water softener. I had tried the level 1 and had to replace it every 30 days because it basically disintegrated and turned to mush if left longer. Just don't let Obama know or he will put a new tax on it.
4,A lovely tale of a lost era,"What a lovely book and what a lovely introduction to Mr Keillor's work. I bought this for 50 English pence from a second hand stall and didn't I get a good deal!! I can't conceive of the imagination required to write a book like this. The characters, the lives they've had and the conversations they have are all outstanding. This book is a funny and sad account of the early days of American radio where the only requirement to become a radio star was to know someone who already worked there. Amateurishness ruled!! the book paints a vivid and charming rendition of the days before disc jockeys (No disc jockeys??!! - I had no idea!) and the de-basing of popular radio. Thoroughly recommended"
3,Not Bad,"I may have expected too much from this book, not sure why I was disapointed with it. It was okay, but did not draw me through like I thought it would. If you are a radio-days historian, it is a must read."
3,Bad Description of the Product,"In the Product Details Amazon sets as subtitles for this movie: Spanish, English, French; but any is present. Today, i reviewed the description at B&N and it is right"
3,just fot die hard van der graaf fans,"In my opinion this is just fot die hard van der graaf fans. It's hammil first album as such with mates, but named as Van der G.There are 2 versions of this cd, each with 2 different and interesting songs for fans.Newcomers to Van der graaf begin with H to he, then go to still life, godbluff, quiet zone, and finally the majestic ... Pawn hearts. You might will get hooked on vdgg and get everything else."
3,Very comprehensive but dry at times,"Dr LeShan is an authority on Meditation and it comes through in his book, speaking from years of experience practicing and from teaching. The first half of the book is dedicated to the several methods used to meditate and the second half talks about the pitfalls and the watch out for. I did learn a lot about how to meditate and the benefits of the process which was the main purpose of reading the book. My only criticism is that the writing is a little slow and the second half to the book tends to drag out. This is a very comprehensive book meditation answering questions that I didn't even think about asking. If you want to know how to meditate, this is a good book to pick up."
3,"I love the book, but see if you can find a different edition","This is a wonderful book, just the sort I love to read. I like it almost as much as Farrell's unfinished The Hill Station.But see if you can find a different edition. This one (New York Review Books) is teeming with typos, each of which is a jarring note and interrupts the superb flow."
5,"Delightful, educational, hilarious, sad","This is the most enjoyable book I've read for ages. The plot is gripping enough to make it a page turner to be raced through, but the writing is so good that I preferred to read in short segments to stretch it out and appreciate the multiple levels. The people jump off the page at the reader with their idiosyncrasies, foibles, warmth, selfishness, delusions. The plot is gipping, but the subject is very informative historically. Everyone I've loaned the book to has purchased their own copy to keep and extras to give to friends......delicious!!!"
3,Stimulating but not totally satisfying.,"Although the premise of this book is one of the best I have encountered in many years, the authors ultimately do not put enough into this book to have it live up to my initial expectations. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the characters should have been developed better to establish sympathy for both sides of the ""divide"". This is one of the few books I can honestly say would have been much better had it actually been longer. As a fan of Mr. Robinson's earlier works with the late Thomas N. Scortia I am used to his writing much more detailed and complex novels than this. (P.S.- these two writers were at the forefront in creating the techno-thriller genre.) I found this book to be shallow in comparison, the characters underdeveloped, and only the high-tension ending made it up to its three-star rating."
4,Linguistics is humane.,Overloaded with theory ridden linguistics? Read this book to relate those theories with humane understandings.
3,a lurid send-up of the Southern Gothic genre,"Calder Willingham's *Eternal Fire* offers all the narrative drama of Faulkner's *Sanctuary,* Flannery O'Connor's freaks and fervor, and Harry Crews' hilarity; what it lacks is their superb flair for the written word. An able racconteur, Willingham shows none of the genius, economy, or lyrical power of his suppposed peers and Eternal Fire suffers as a result. His characters lack depth and many of the lurid betrayals and seductions telegraph their punches. It's a fun read, but literature, it ain't."
5,Amazing Clarity,The best shooting glasses I've owned to date. Lens have great clarity and are simple to change out depending on light conditions. Highly recommend!
3,Not bad but i was expecting more,"I picked up this book since i travel quite a bit and i was hoping to get more out of it.Altough this is not a bad book per se, its not the ultimate travel book.Basically its a book in which the author explains some of the situations he experienced as a flight steward.A couple are funny, the rest are just odd situations but not major things."
2,A Dissapointment,"I have been searching for this cd for over 2 years and i finnaly got a copy recently......Having already heard acouple tracks i liked... i thought that the Applejacks would become one of my favorite Merseybeat bands.I was very wrong. There are only a few good songs on this cd(Tell Me When,Like Dreamers Do) and the rest are really bad covers(Aint that just like me, Too much monkey buisness) My sugestion is that you try to find these two 45's because the two good songs i mentioned are FANTASTIC.....but i wouldnt buy this cd"
5,hooked on books still,"This was great!! My daughter absolutely loves these books. She is only 8 yrs old, but will sit for hours reading them. How many kids ask for books for Christmas!!"
4,"Bad grammar , but my daughter LOVES to read!!!!","Yes, Junie B. Jones has horrible grammar , but my daughter who is 6 loves to read these books and recognizes the bad grammar for what it is . She also recognizes the bad manners , and we talk about how ""Junie B. Jones is not a very nice girl"". I personally hate Junie B. Jones , but my daughter loves her and loves to read these books , and as long as she understands that this is not appropriate behavior - I am okay with her reading these books."
1,Overall a bad choice for your child,"Some of the storylines are half-acceptable if you can get past the barrage of bad grammar and poorly formed sentences. For the life of me I do not understand why someone would write children's stories that use bad grammar and teach improper English. What is the point of that? Do 6-9 yr old kids speak this way? No, they do not, or at least they should be taught not to. Not to mention the behavior that is being taught... Does the author speak this way? Does her children speak and behave this way? I hope not. I feel sorry for the parents who think these are nice books and that they describe acceptable behavior.Please do yourself (and your child) a big favor and look elsewhere for prose. There are countless wonderful books out there. Good luck."
5,This book was read to me 40 years ago. I've never forgotten,"When I was in grade school more than 40 years ago, the nun who taught our combined-in-one-room 7th and 8th grade classes read this book to us in two 30-minute periods each week. Reading Edward Rutherford's ""Sarum"" a few weeks ago, reminded me again of a book that I've never really forgotten, and caused me to purchase a copy to see if the book is still as exciting as it was then. Sister DeChantal and ""The Outlaws of Ravenhurst"" introduced me to the joys of having a book read to me -- a joy that was in hibernation until recorded books became widely available a few years ago, but a joy that is now one of my favorite ways to indulge myself."
3,"Outrageous, all right.",Musically complex and varied... located snuggly in the jazzy-jokey end of the jam-band spectrum.
3,Goldilocks and the 3 pillows,"I tried this pillow for 2 night's at a friend's house last year. I usually use a down pillow and was impressed by the very down-like feel, which is hard to come by in a synthetic fill. However, after using it for a about 2 weeks, the filling compressed and shifts to either end of pillow so there is a flat spot in middle by morning. Shaking it to redistribute filling is a nightly chore. I don't think there is sufficient filling in this pillow. At the same time I bought this pillow, I bought the Natural Living High Loft King Pillow with Ingeo Fiber Fill. The High Loft pillow has so much filling that your head hardly makes a dent in it. I am seriously thinking about transferring some of the filling from the King size (too hard) into the queen size (too soft) to hopefully get a Just Right pillow."
5,Geat CD!,Love the songs! They remind me of the freedom and deliverance I have found through Jesus Christ. They uplift me and lead me into worship.
5,Highly readable translation,Highly readable translation that conveys the poetic beauty of the Illiad and the Odyssey. The typography and physical construction of these volumes is also excellent.
1,Doesn't Last,"This is a horrible product. The concept is good, but the cable frays at both ends and become unusable. Do not buy."
3,Don't use for brewing beer,i found this to not be accurate enough to be used for the brewing of beer. i'm sure it fits its designed purpose for frying very well. I'm just gonna have to find a thermometer more suited to my purposes.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one of these about a year ago - tested it in boiling water - it registered 160. Tested it in a 350 oven. It registered 240. Contacted the company, which was also difficult. They weren't very nice at all, but finally agreed to send me another one. I tested the second one in boiing water. It registered 190. In a 350 oven, it registered 275. (Now, I see they're selling them at 2 for the price of one.) I ended up buying another brand and while it wasn't perfectly exact, it was close enough."
4,Cultural Diversity,"Cultural diversity rules America as this music doco of a Jewish rap group testified.It is notSnoop Dogg's Doggystylesurely, but it is fun anyway."
4,Delightful,This delightful movie in the vein on Remington Steele and Moonlighting is brimming with lighthearted humor and clever action. Far more entertaining and accessible than the dreadful Mr and Mrs Smith. Haven't seen a film from Hong Kong this polished since John Woo's The Killer. Recommended.
2,Not very well written,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. iT IS NOT VERY WELL WRITTEN. NOT BOTHER TO BUY THIS BOOK.
4,Something to Enjoy,"A great CD of Terry's, very full of warmth and thought provoking lyrics. Sit back and listen, it will stir your feelings for sure. The piano and guitar shows lots of talent that you will appreciate. I thinbk the music style can be enjoyed by anyone, anytime."
5,Mccoy Tyner At the Warsaw Jazz Jamboree.,"Mccoy Tyner is one of the legendary members of the John Coltrane Quartet, others being Elvin Jones (drums), Jimmy Garrison (bass). During those years with John Coltrane, he perfected his art of piano playing. When the group disintegrated he carried on with various explorations, for example, big bands, quartets, trios and solos. The subject of this review is one of the solo albums he recorded in Europe. This is an excellent album showcasing the man at his prime. This ranks among the best of Tyner's solo albums like Echoes of a Friend, Soliloquy, to name but a few. The recording is out of the top drawer, and his performance is phenomenal. I personally like Bluesin' with Bob, Monk's dream and the rest of the tracks that followed. Anyone who like Mccoy Tyner will not be without this CD. Highly recommended."
3,what I expected,"At full resolution the video does this strange warping effect, which can be creatively inspiring, but gets old quick.The grainy medium resolution is much cleaner for action.The sound is useless. this has no effect on my overall rating. I don't care about sound with regard to this products applications.For the price its a fun toy, but don't take it seriously. its great that it is water proof and durable. Now if it actually captured decent video, then we'd have a genuinely great item. If it also had even decent sound, then we'd really have something to rave about. Currently it's stretching it to give it a 3, but for the price, there's nothing like it."
4,Fairly bulletproof camera,"If you want to capture video in perilous situations, this camera isn't a bad choice but the image quality is poor. The optics are the primary problem. It is difficult to distinguish image quality differences between the maximum pixel resolution (640x480) and the lower resolutions due to the poor quality optics. The audio isn't very good either, even with the protective cap removed. Still, the camera is robust and will probably survive most abuse so it has its place."
3,lights! camera! action!,"A decent price for a compact underwater/action video camera. It is true, the sound quality is rubbish. But I knew this before going in, and knew I could remove the audio track and either voice over or put some music on, so no suprise there.Quality of the video is so-so, it white outs really easy if you go from a shady spot to sunny.Its probably the cheapest underwater and action cam you can buy, I use it to record my fish underwater and when I play paintball. Comes with various mounting kits so you can strap it to your head, gun, handlebars, etc."
3,Memory Card warning,"A 4 GB memory card is Amazon's suggestion as an additional purchase. The camera WILL NOT work with anything larger than a 1 GB card. I contacted Oregon Scientific and was given this information. When the 4 GB card was inserted an ERR message would show up on the tiny screen. The manual had no details/information for this particular error code, and the technician from OS told me the manuals would be updated to included this (in the future)."
5,why i buyed it,the reason i had for buying it was for using in my reef aquarium.image was like you are swimming in a real reef.
3,Its decent,This package took long to get here but it is pretty good and if u wanna see it in action i will post a video on youtube if u wanna see it go to thecountryboy3411
3,Pricey!,The price of this camera isn't great. The quality of the videos aren't all that great either and are grainy. Mot worth the price.
4,Good price..Good camera,"This unit has a good picture. Easy to operate and a very reasonable price. The only drawback os the audio is poor. I like how compact it is and that it uses standard batteries. No recharging, just insert a fresh set and your ready to go. Another great feature is the direct video playback to TV. The unit comes with several mounts and attachments for a wide variety of applications."
1,Only Good For Underwater,"The bike and other mounts are useless, the picture was unwatchable and the unit picked up every vibration making the sound something awful and screechy. And I was on smooth concrete the entire way.Underwater the picture is good from 3-5 feet, that's it. The sound is still a mess, since it seems to rely on vibrations, and even the water overwhelmed it, every dunk was thunder.Overall, a piece of junk barely worth $30, if that. I bought mine FOR water, so I can still use it, but I should've researched it better."
2,records in a weird format,I've downloaded the massive k-lite codec packs for both 32 bit and 64 bit and I can't get my video editing programs to let me play with this file type. I have to use a video capture card to get the video on to my computer in a usable format. Mono sound.
3,Oregon Scientific ATC 2K Action Cam Flash Memory Camcorder,"You get what you pay for. Don't expect too much from a device in this price category. It is easy to mount and operate. However it needs some practice to adjust to ensure it points into the intended direction and it is not skewed, especially when mounted to a helmet. So better take a portable media player with you to replay a test sequence and adjust the cam position until you are satisfied. Unfortunately it does not show live image when attached to a monitor. You need to record first and playback to view the result."
5,Great Camera for Outdoors!!!!,"Length:: 3:23 MinsGreat camera for sports,I recommend it because I use it for the Enduro Championship at my country.You'll get alot of fun with this cam.good things.- it has 2 o-rings that are a great waterproof.- with 2gb sd = 1hour of video at 640*480 with 30fps, excelent video.- 2 alcaline bateries let you to get more than 3 hours of video.- small size camera. that is Excelent!!bad things.- if you want to use it with motorcycle helmet, you'll maybe need to do some modifications to the helmet.- it only allow you to use 2gb sd card at max size. recomendations: buy more than one SD!- indoors will be a dark video, if you does'nt have a good ilumination."
5,Incredible insights into the nature of music,"How very few thinkers on music dare even consider the topic of emotion and meaning in music shows the difficulty of the task Meyer sets himself. This is a truly important book--far beyond any history or theoretical tome I've ever read, this aims right at the heart of what music is about. It is very tough going--this was adapted from Meyer's doctoral dissertation, but it repays every effort made. Meyer's mind is enviably far-ranging; he uses examples from the visual arts to the hard sciences and philosophy to make his points. His later book, Explaining Music, is an easier read, still full of valuable insights but much more oriented toward a theoretical, quasi-Schenkerian approach to music. But for me, Emotion and Meaning in Music (along with his much later Style and Music) is much more significant, dealing with more profound and much less frequently discussed issues. This book has my HIGHEST recommndation."
2,"Bought it a few months ago, haven't listened since.","I like to rate albums after the fact, in most cases. I remember being impressed by the artists' virtuosity on the guitar. That's all I remember. The recording style and instrumentation has a '70's feel to it. Some might not care, I do. After all, the album is from 1982. The result is that you'll listen all the way through the first time. Then, when the novelty wears off, you'll file it in your spare CD case and forget about it. If you're just checking out this style of music, this album might not be the one for you."
5,A Mango Shaped Space,"I loved this book because for girls my age, (11) I can really relate to Mia and her problems. It is about a girl named Mia who has something very strange about her. She sees and hears in colors. She has no idea what it means and she thinks at first that it is completely normal and that everyone sees this way; until a third grade mishap. Then she finally realizes that it's just her cat Mango against the world."
2,The Mango-Shaped Space was a waste of space,"I'm fourteen years old and in eighth grade, and after hearing some good things about the book from some friends who read it in elementary school, I decided to take it from the class library for a short read. It was certainly a large mistake, considering I could not stand the book in the long run. Although the general concept of the plot including synesthesia is a good idea, overall the execution was not well done. From the very beginning I had no interest in the characters and felt as if they had no depth. And even though the main character, Mia, is supposed to be in eighth grade I thought for a while she was in fifth. I couldn't relate to her or any of her friends for that matter and felt as if Wendy Mass's interpretation of a eighth grade girl was correct, nor realistic. I could not stand this book, although I feel as if I was perhaps two or three years younger it might actually have appealed to me. I would never recommend this for someone my age."
5,colors are everywhere just look,by kierraFirst of all I love Wendy Mass she writes beautiful.I really like the way she makes you feel like your there in the story.In this book she does it again.A Mango Shaped Space is about a girl named Mia who has a very special gift.Mia can see colors everywhere in letters and numbers but also in sounds.Mia decides never to tell anyone intill one day her the little secret gets out.Mia finds out she has snythesia and their are others just like her.This book makes you giggle cry and get nerves.This book also believe it or not has some romance.It is a real page turner i read it in two days. Again this book is amazing and fun to read i highly recomend it.
5,Not just for kids!!!!!!!,"This book is an amazing story from start to finish. I just couldn't put it down. And I'm far from a being a kid, at age 49!"
2,Very Dissappointing for Ms. Mass,"I absolutely LOVE Wendy Mass's books. So after reading Heaven Looks a Lot Like the Mall, and Leap Day, I decided that this book must be fantastic, too. I was very wrong.The plot sounds great, and Mia's synesthesia seems very interesting. But the book wasn't all that great. It wasn't funny and realistic, like Wendy's other books. Maybe if I had a cat and synesthesia I would have enjoyed the book better, but I thought it was just bland. Very boring. This is very dissappointing, I suggest that you read Ms. Mass's other books before picking this one up."
5,Winter Dreams by Carlos Nakai,This is one of the most beautiful Christmas CD's ever produced. Although an obscure artist Carlos Nakai always creates an enchanting dreamlike environment for his listeners.
5,Jill's Review,I bought the Winnie the Pooh plush toy with the Soft 'n Silly Tigger and Eyeore. These toys were extremely soft and fun to cuddle. Other consumers who previously purchased these items rated the Soft 'n Silly Disney items extremely high. This was very important since I was donating these toys to my church.
3,Diameter please?,"I need a replacement pan for a Master Forge electric smoker. It is 12 1/2"" in diameter. What is the diameter of this pan?"
4,Kitchen too flimsy for 10 month old,"My granddaughter is 10 months old. She is learning to pull herself up on things and stand. This kitchen, although a very educational toy for children, should not be recommended for anyone under 15 months or non walking babies. If you buy this item, please stay with the child the whole time they play."
3,"Great Idea, bad design","I was so excited to get this for my 9 month old for christmas, but the thing keeps tipping over! The phone doesn't stay on the side, and the utensils barely stay either. The shape sorter is nice as well as the sounds on the stove, but overall I am disappointed, and my daughter hasn't touched it more than a few times."
4,Very Cute!,"I purchased this kitchen for my 7 month old daughter and she loved it from the moment I brought it home! I also purchased some fisher price pretend foods ( chicken, hamburger, and corn on the cob) to go with it. She plays with this toy quite often and has really enjoyed it. If your looking for a ""cute"" kitchen for a 6 month to 2 year old - this is it!"
5,"A great ""starter"" kitchen","We bought this toy for our 16-month-old daughter for Christmas. She really loves it. The little sound effects are very cute. She loves to ""cook"" things on the stove and wash dishes in the sink. It could be a bit taller.. that's why I would recommend it for around 12-18 months.UPDATE- We now have a son who just turned 1, and he has really enjoyed this kitchen for the last month or so! He loves the ice feature especially. One great feature about the icemaker is that the holes are large enough for both shaped pieces to fit in each, making it easy to use and less frustrating. GREAT kitchen overall."
2,Poor Durability,Our daughter received this as a Christnmas present. At 9 months she tended to tip it over when she would hold onto it and try to stand. She also shattered the green oven door when she climbed on it after she tipped it over and the pieces were hard and sharp.I was shocked at how easily the door shattered and quite disappointed. It ended up in the trash after only having it for a few weeks.
3,Size is the problem...,My daughter received this toy for her first birthday. While we thought it would be the perfect kitchen because of its size (we are limited on space)we found out otherwise. The size is the problem. It is not very sturdy and when my daughter opens the doors the kitchen easily falls over. Also there are not many accessories and she easily loses interest.
4,My son has played with this toy for 3 years!!,"Santa brought this toy for my son when he was barely one. It has always been a favorite with my two boys and now my 11 month old girl is playing with it. She loves to push the ice button and hold the phone up to her ear. Since they made a few sounds, I wish they had made the phone ring...It has been a great toy!"
1,Not that much fun for a 10 month old,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter. Convinced she would love it. I have tried for almost a month now to get her interested in this toy to no avail. Other than chewing on the ice cubes & pail she could care less about it. For that I could have just bought her plastic blocks to chew on that are far cheaper. Also, now that she is crawling she tried to pull herself up on it and it is so weightless it toppels over. I disagree with the manufacturer recommended age. This would probably be a much better toy for a 2-3 year old child that understands the kitchen and pretend play."
1,total waste of money !!!!,"I bought this for my daughter who is 17 months old. I was extremely excited since her daycare provider told me that the kitchen area was her favorite. I payed [money] for it. We put it together while she was sleeping and eagerly awaited morning to see her play with it. Huge disapointment. Within 5 minutes she was bored with it and moved on to a... ball. This thing is so tiny. The inside of the fridge is filled with ""drawers"" that don't pull out taking up space. The shelf in it was just big enough to fit a small box of animal crackers. The same with the oven and microwave. Even in a sitting position she had to bend to play with it. The range top was only big enough to fit the pot and pan it came with and there was no overhead room to drop play food in them. The shape sorter isn't at all educational because there are only 3 shapes and they all fit into the circle hole so there was no challenge. Bad investment..."
3,"Excelent in places, unlistenable in others.","Having just purchased the cd version after wearing out my LP, I was most dissapointed with the addidtion of vocals on the track 'Spiders Of Destiny' as they seem out of place and somewhat annoying. However, the recording quality is absoloutly top notch, and the first track 'Filthy Habits' sounds as dark and intense as ever, especially at high volume. I suggest you listen to it before you buy it as it is reasonably different to many of Franks other albums, and many listeners may be dissapointed with what they find there."
5,Great Instrumental Zappa,"I'm someone who loves most of Zappa's instrumental music, but I'm not keen on his vocal tracks. Regardless of who is singing, I generally think his music is better without it, largely due to his woeful sense of humour. So I stuck solidly with the vinyl version of this album when it first came out on CD with the additional vocals on three tracks. Finally, it's wonderful to get the album in CD sound quality without vocals distracting from this wonderful, complex music. It's brilliant. One of his best I think. It seems to be unjustly neglected within his huge collection of albums."
2,Poor,"I used this book for a graduate engineering hydrology course. The text covered the basics of surface water flow well enough (not spectacular), but there were numerous issues; namely incorrect answers to the exercises at the end of the chapter, numerous typos, and the information regarding groundwater is very poor at best. Also, the print quality was lacking, especially some of the graphs and maps in the back of the book, which you could barely make out. I prefer Physical Hydrology by Dingman, it is a much more competent book on the subject."
2,"Fashionable but ""cold""","I received this item in a timely manner. The item looks good and you'll get compliments but the scarf is losely knit and does not keep my head warm enough - the wind blows right through it. Not a ""cold"" weather item."
4,Love it.,"Tomorrow is my favorite song, since receiving the CD I have played that song every single day over and over again."
5,IT SPEAKS FOR IT SELF,The winans has done their very best to spresd the word through song and they have.Thank You so much for blessing me with this cd
4,If you need a book you can read in about an hour...,"I have read most of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, and am a big fan. A friend of mine told me he had heard this book was not so good, but I disagree. I really liked it. My friend happens to be a rather politically conservative type, and after reading the book, I can see why ""those people"" might not like what they read here. There are several memorable lines of political commentary, a couple of which even made me laugh out loud. But don't expect anything along the lines of ""Breakfast of Champions"" or ""Galapagos""; this is strictly memoir fare.I don't know that I'd recommend buying this book, however - I got my copy from the library, and it's so short, I would have felt a bit cheated if I had paid for it myself."
2,The non-humerous curmudgeon,In the opening of this book Vonnegut states that he was not planning on writing another book; he should have stuck with that plan. A Man Without a Country is left winged bitterness without humor - sorry I wasted a spot on my Christmas wish list for this book.
3,last words,"It was a good book, but it wasn't his best. I just saw it as his last words to his readers. As with all KVJ books it was full of lots of harsh wisdom. If more people read and understood KVJ, the better off we would all be."
4,If you like Vonnegut like I like Vonnegut,"One you should have for sure if you are a fan, but I think it would be fun to read even if you aren't."
5,Vonnegut at His Best,"I've only read a handful of Vonnegut's works aside from this book (Slaughterhouse V, Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, Player Piano, God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian), and after completing this I intend to read the rest. It's not quite a memoir as it doesn't start out ""Well I was born in so-and-so and at the age of..."" Vonnegut spoke very much in the present, addressing politics, war, humanism, and people in an absolutely unapologetic tone.If you have read and enjoyed any Vonnegut at all this is an excellent book to choose."
5,Still the Greatest!,"What can I say but, Vonnegut (still) rocks?! Few are better at straightforward, laugh-out-loud funny, smart, incisive, substantive commentary, whether he's doing it in his fiction or, as in this book, nonfiction. He's always fresh and ahead of the curve (particularly with the earlier stuff), and he's a true humanist through and through, who walks it like he talks it. There is nothing about this writer, or his work, that I don't like!"
4,Not bad,The quality is great but the only downside for me is that its bigger than I thought it would be.
2,essential book but missing pages,"Don't buy this version of Man's Supreme Inheritance, find a different copy. This book is a scanned reprint of an older version so the wear and tear and missing pages or that scanned book are in this version. I'm glad that this book exists but MSI has been reprinted and the full version is available elsewhere."
4,Filler & Brilliance!,"I have to admit that I am a Zappa madman, I have every album & a load of boots so I guess that i'm not 100% objective on this one! This album was always a bit of a conundrum. It doesn't really have a cohesion that many of the late era albums do have. Either side of this you have Man From Utopia which is a kind of B-movie related album (referentially & thematically) and Tinsletown Rebellion, which is all live and a fab all-round representation of the 1982 band.There is a lot of filler, No Not Now could've been done by Frank in about 5 minutes and Valley Girl is funny for a while. There's some great guitar playing on I Come From Nowhere and on side 2. It's an average album, if you want something from the same era that will keep you listening for hours get You Are What You Is or the earlier Joes Garage albums. Actually no, just buy the whole lot - sell your wife into slavery, I know I did."
2,"broken bones are not erotic, you morons.","While I can give a moderate rating for the acting, and the film work is better than many other Cronenberg films, the idea of finding near fatal automobile accidents erotic is utterly perverse. This is voyeurism for idiots who have never been seriously physically wounded and know nothing about real physical pain. Break your femur and see what that does to your libido, you morons."
3,cannot make up my mind,"This film is problematic to review, it is a bit hard to fathom depicting unfamiliar situations in strange circumstances.This is the second time I bought this DVD having sold the first one. The film haunted me, threfore, I decided to buy it again. Will probably get to see it on a bleak evening. Cheerful it is not. All I can say, the director is very interesting the actors measure up to expectations, still, the movie is difficult.It cannot be recommended for a large audience, but then none of this director's movies can."
4,Well made but lack of intensiveness on the main issue,"Even though Mr. Cronenberg signs everyone of his movies with that special touch of irony of life & confusion of where you are standing; In CRASH I found that he ""hangs around"" the story of crashing as a material fact instead of enfatizing the fact of the enigma between people that experience and accident and feel attracted fisically and spiritually to each other. I have to say that sound was excellent as well as photography on the DVD version. Is is a great movie but is NOT Cronenbergs best. Spader worderful and smooth as always & Hunter incredibly sexy."
1,ewwwwww,"This has to be the sickest film I have ever seen, and i saw the R rated version. I would really hate to see what the un-rated one looks like. This film had some pretty gross scenes that makes ""Dead Alive"" look like Bambi. I would not recommend this film to anyone with good health. It is sick, psychgotic, and just plain disgusting."
1,Crash,"I did not like this movie or its content, and would not watch it again.The subject matter is not something that does anything to uplift or inspire a person in any way.Getting sexually aroused by seeing an accident with blood and injuries is to me something too wierd to even think about.I think that it was a waste of money and effort to produce rubbish like this, and I would be ashamed to show it to my family or friends.I highly commend Amazon .com for their incredibly friendly and efficient service. I have purchased a few items from them and I have never been disappointed."
2,Good Book But Mediocre Movie!,The best part of the whole movie was the stageing of the James Dean crash.
1,"Painfully, ponderously bad.","The problem I have with this movie is that it is so painfully self-aware. Every scene seems to cry out, ""Look! Look how shocking and erotic and artistic this is! Wow! Aren't you shocked! Look - weird sex! How erotic and shocking! See, it's a big comment on modern life! It's art! "". The whole movie is like something out of a ""Sprockets"" sketch on Saturday Night Live. I'm somewhat surprised it wasn't filmed in black and white, dubbed into French, and shown with subtitles to make it more pretentious. However, like most things that go out of their way to be shocking and artistic, this movie falls flat on its face, failing to either shock or stimulate. Had the movie backed off a bit, it would still be bad, but I might have been able to enjoy a laugh or two at the filmmaker's expense - instead, I found myself rolling my eyes and wishing the movie would just get over itself already."
2,A porn movie,"A porn movie disguised as a kind of a art form. Very bad. Fortunately this movies is the exception to the rule: cronenberg is a great director. I hope ""crash"" was just the result of bad mood...."
3,Exploring the psychiatry of perversion,"This is a slighty better than average exploration into why perversions are compelling. This film is effective. In order to be effective it has to do two things: first, it must discomfort us, and that it surely does, and second, it must make us excited by the very discomfort we feel. Cronenberg seems to enjoy a lifes work of this and here, he is reasonably successful. Car crashes are disasters we are all conditioned to be shamefully thrilled to see. Ballard's touch of making them a field for erotic exploration only heightens this. Cronenberg had the good sense to realize he could make us scared of ourselves by giving us this to watch. Where he failed was in the execution. The film is well cast but the characters need more enrgy. The film could also use better sound.It's worth seeing, but it is not a masterpiece."
1,Unerotic Dullness,"What annoys me about this movie is not it's constant porno like sex, or it's dull,undeveloped one dimentional playing card like characters but the lack of regard for human life or suffering. It's irratating. There is no point to this movie whatsoever than to show how strange people can be and to make me never want to drive a car ever in fear of such lunatics."
1,put it in a blender and hit liquify,"Obvious attempt to grab some of that multi-million dollar porn industry profit. A marginally dirty movie made with a look-I'm-so-smart styling in effort to hook both the raincoat crowd and the latte lappers in one swoop. Earns placement on my personal ten all time worst. Good God, Hollywood! Twenty brilliant indy efforts could have been financed from the investments spent on this hogwash. Where am you brain at????"
1,Don't believe the hype.,Okay I gave this a try after reading the countless ravings about how great this show is and was quite frankly left with a bitter taste in my mouth.Overall I found LAIN to be a down right boring mess of an Anime filled with annoying characters (heck Lain Herself was as interesting as watching paint dry) and one of the slowest plots I have ever sat through.I honestly can't recommend this at all and I'm no noob who just didn't get it either (face it you fans reading this were probably thinking just that) and I highly recommend the superior in every way Boogipop Phantom over this tripe.Now thats an Anime.
4,Quick Overview,"Fascinating and surreal. Dream intersecting with Reality, flowing into one another with a matrix overlay, until you're left not knowing exactly what's going on... which is exactly how Lain feels."
5,Excellent Series,"I highly recommend this series. Most enjoyable were the references to DQN, Anonymous, &c. Those English English speakers curious about Japanese-style Anonymous forum/chat systems similar to (although not nearly as radically cool as) parts of Lain would do well to visit the Channel4 BBS (4-ch, not 4chan >.< )."
3,Variable,"Lain is a mixed box. The music is excellent, and the art is nice to look at. However if you forgetting to look to symbolism for a plot (because honestly who can be bothered) there are times when this gets a bit slow and any air of suspense is lost because it puts you to sleep. the characters really don't have much by way of inderviduality, and although I'm not saying sterotypes or binary oppisates are necessary, some show of personality would have been nice. That said, it did have a good ending... but then when you've been sitting there in a torpor for so long, perhaps any ending is a good one? I would not recommend this for people who like or rely on action in their viewing."
5,Very good animation and characters,"The DVD is mainly about this game called the Wired. Lain, the main character, gets interested in this game. She startes to get obsest with the game and forces herself to get more and more into the game and becomes part of the internet. Her friend Alice, tries to her her, but after Alice tries, Lain (accidently) hurts her (not physically). [...] I won't tell you what happend in the end because you have to find that out yourself, (Hee, hee.) The story is very dramatic and serius.RATED 13 UP FOR sexual parts/language/blood scenes."
3,Rather Amateur and not too well organized,"Let's face it, once you've zipped through Rosetta Stone Level one there is no level two or three - in Danish at least, so there's precious little out there if you want to get beyond boys jumping on or off tables and women pointing or not pointing!This product is actually quite useful as a grammar primer - something totally lacking in most orally based instruction methods but as a tool for practising oral Danish it's rather limited - then again it's pretty cheap so I suppose you get what you pay for."
3,A Personnal Approach,"First off Van the serial killer depicted by Owen Wilson is very likable. Upon enter the town people take him in immediately as a friend. Day by Day Van narrates his thoughts permiting a glimpse into the killers psyche. Owen Wilson isn't the typical brutal serial killer. His method is passive. Each victim as you will see flows toward there death. It's an ok film. It was somewhat interesting. The DVD contains nothing of great importance. Picture quality is relaxed. Color is bright and clear. This is a much different film from classics like Seven, Silence of the Lambs and Henry."
4,eerie film in that we've all met people like this,"laconic people who seem to be manufacturing the minimum they feel you need to know . closed books who are just a bit or perhaps more than a bit disturbingly odd . this is a very interesting film that is easy to over or underpraise . the filmaker had the strength to see to it that we did not get a hollywood ending . i think that's something that should be rewarded for its probable reasism . ordinary people in anytown u.s.a. written and depicted quite well . having many layers themselves . i recommend a rental . very far removed from most ""horror"" films about this sort of subject ."
1,Mike,If you want to waste 2 hours watch this movie. Even Owen Wilson couldn't save this abortion of a movie.
2,Deceptive Title,"The title of this book leads you to believe that it might be a training guide. Dont be deceived! This book is a collection of 10 or so short biographies of some of the leading bench pressers.They talk about how they got into powerlifting, briefly describe their routines,diet and training approach...but all of this is done briefly. The book is 126pp. It's a small sized book with pictures on all of the pages (the pictures are usually of the particular bench presser at some event...they are not instructive pictures describing technique). In other words there is not a lot of meat.Some of the stories are inspirationaly (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but at $20, you'd do better investing that money in supplements or towards your gym fee. If you see this book at a garage sale (maybe mine!) selling for a buck think of getting it. Otherwise, pass!"
5,"Thorough, honest, and fair","I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore, and found it to be a wonderful read. I've always been curious about the history of the area I grew up in, and this book gives a solid introduction to the area. I cannot speak for history buffs of the region, who might quibble with a fact or two, but I'm glad to find such an engaging book on the subject."
5,Fusion heaven,From the opening of Kudu to the end of Movin' On this is a feast for fusion lovers. Loads of fat and funky grooves will get your bits moving. If you've sampled the Blue Note 'Blue Break Beats' series you'll recognise a few of the tunes here: and it's great to get a whole album of Eddie Henderson's 70's fusion music reissued on CD. An essential purchase!
1,"Getting the Facts Wrong: A Misguided Critique of PBS's ""Evolution"" miniseries","I will concede that PBS's ""Evolution"" miniseries is filled with omissions of fact, most notably in discussing current controversies regarding the tempo and mode of evolution, but it does a fine job nonetheless in introducing the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution to an interested public audience, stressing the importance of this theory towards our understanding of all aspects of biology, from developmental biology and population genetics to paleobiology and ecology, and last, but not least, both epidemiology and medicine. Carl Zimmer's companion volume to the PBS miniseries ""Evolution"" does an admirable job elaborating on some of the points briefly mentioned or not covered in the PBS program. That book, also entitled ""Evolution"", should be a potential reader's guide, not this error-filled, woefully misguided effort at critiquing ""Evolution"" from a pro-Intelligent Design perspective."
2,Slower than the walk itself,"I love detail, but this had too much. The hike was described inch by inch rather than a group of miles. I have read 4 books on the trail, 'On the Beaten Path' by Robert Rubin was an easier read."
2,Way To Hard to Follow,"The book is way to hard to follow with the constant switch from the Real Me to my Alter Ego me ,this is supposed to be a fun read not a contest"
5,Outstanding story about hiking the Appalachian Trail,I am house bound and I find books about long distance hikes to be uplifting.This book is one of those and it also talks of companionship and endurance.It is a book that may motivate you to do any number of things that you have wanted to do but have put off.Or it may remind you of past adventures.
2,Bryn terfel wagner,"Poor audio quality. Terfel is great, recording terrible. Hopefully others will be better.His Ring recording is good. Would like to return for credit."
1,Yawn...on to the band wagon too Mr Terfel?,"Mr Terfel is not a singer for Wagner and this CD shows this all too painfully...what more can I say? Spend your money buying any of the other CD's of Wagner that reflect the greatness of the music, not just as a ""show case"" for a singer. What next Mr Terfel? A touch of Harrison Birtwistle, a soupcon of Ligeti, they are all getting popular now, you know; best get on the band wagon."
3,Not a Wagnerian,"Well, what can one say after waiting so long? I expected to be awash in this gorgeous voice, with wave after wave of beauty. The impression that I actually had, after all was sung and done, was that Mr. Terfel is not a Wagnerian. The voice is certainly beautiful, but it simply lacks the heroic thrill I was looking for (and waiting for all these years). He sounds pressed at times, like the voice has no more to give. This also has to be the most overinterpreted Wagner I have heard. It has a certain lieder quality to it, but her it is excessive finesse, subtle delicacy and shading for no purpose, when the grander line is indicated. It is worth having, but not listening to over and over for the sheer joy of beauty."
5,Poignant and Impactful,"Though this is a ""gay"" movie its message is for every person who has every loved and been loved. So that means that everyone would benefit from watching this excellently scripted and acted ensemble movie. This movie is part of my collection."
5,Lori Petty?,"Uhm,yeah;this isn't so much of a review as it is a question....In this movie,do you get to see Lori Petty nude or semi-nude or anything like that?Because that's the only reason why I would want to watch this movie that looks incredibly stupid.Sorry, but a movie about some gay guy and his troubles with finding ""true love"" are not anywhere near my must see list......"
3,ok,This movie definetly had a different plot then all the other gay films out there. A Gay man takes revenge on what the straights have been doing to him.. The scene is shocking and his friends plead with him but he doesn't stop and you feel sorry for him and the abused .. then he disappears. What happens next ? Go and see for yourself.
5,The Best,"This rendition of the Messiah has facinated me since I was a child listening to my parents LP. The voices of the choir are stunning and precise. The clarity of all of the notes on Let Us Break Our Bonds Assunder, which is seldom heard, and All We Like Sheep is amazing. This recording is alive with vitality. This version will grow on you and keep you coming back time and again. Not just a Christmas CD."
5,"When uncertain, I choose this one","As owner of over 50 of Frank's works, this is the one is seem to choose most. It seems to sum up the quintessential Frank, with social commentary, great guitar solos, impossible instrumentals, and new renditions of classic songs. Besides, it's got killer renditions of ""Bolero"", ""Ring of Fire"" (believe it or not), and the horns' rendition of Jimmy Page's guitar solo on ""Stairway to Heaven"" always lifts my spirits."
2,"Should have been titled ""_ Steps to MY Songwriting Success""","This book is not an insightful look at the creative process, as the title misleadingly suggests. It is more an autobiographical account of the author's personal songwriting experiences...""getting to the heart of MY creativity"" would have been a more accurate subtitle. This author clearly loves to talk about himself, and presumptuously considers his personal retellings a path ""to the heart of creativity."""
2,Shameless,"This book is a shameless plug for his other book,which he mentions and footnotes to every other page, as well as his workshops, and CDs. It is not a book about how to write songs, it is a book about a person you've never heard of who writes songs, many of which you've never heard. Truly a waste of time."
1,Conair's worst hair dryer! Beware & don't buy it!,"I bought 2 of those hair dryers, one for me, one for my daughter. After mine broke (2 months later), I used my daughter's and it worked for maybe another 3 months. The cord didn't always retract and the motor burned out completely. The concept of the dryer is great, but the performance is poor!"
5,VERY GOOD CD,This is one of the best cd's I heard in a long time. They are my favorite band and I love there music. They lyrics are very meaningful and their future looks very promising.
4,A Great Effort,"I was really excited when I bought this album. I had heard a lot about Unwritten Law but never actually quite made the effort to hear their music. And then one day I heard ""Seein' Red"" and decided they are worth checking out. From ""Mean Girl"" to ""Evolution"", this album is quite enjoyable. This album really mixes it up. I really love it because when I was listening to it, I wasn't sure what the next song was going to be like. One song could be fast paced and hard hitting (""Hellborn"") and the next may be emotional (""Elva"") and soft. There are many influences in the music of this album. There is obviously the poppy punk, alternative, ska, and heavy riffs (I'm not going to call it metal). All the influences and diversities in the album make ""Elva"" quite a unique and interesting experience. It never gets boring and there really isn't any songs worth passing up. My favorite songs of the album are: ""Seein' Red"", ""Geronimo"", ""Up All Night"", and ""Babalon""."
2,ick,"I bought this cd, like most people I'm sure, after hearing their song ""Seein Red"". What i thought i'd get is a great cd with songs like that one. Boy was I wrong. I liked almost nothing off this album. Oh yeah, and what the heck is up with the Raleigh Soliloquy? Are they trying to be Sublime or something? Whatever, they could never be Sublime..."
2,used bin,"Well UL is a band that I used to be real big on, but their last few albums have let me down. I guess it is all for the sake of growth, but ELVA is all over the map, and not what I want to hear from these guys. Stick to driving melodic punk songs and quit the experimenting. I can't really pick too many songs that stood out on this album, and there were plenty that I had to skip through because they just don't work. UL, please go back to your roots, and put out a solid album that rocks. OH, you can probably find my copy of this album in a used bin somewhere in San Diego, I'm selling it ASAP."
3,"some good, more bad","i just bought this cd and at first i wished i didn't. but i listened to it all the way through and found a few good songs in a mostly lame mix of punk metal and ska. ""sound siren"", ""seein' red"", ""geronimo"", ""rescue me"", and ""actress, model.."" are all very good songs. but then they come back with songs like ""hellborn"" and ""mean girl"" which just suck. so if you don't mind paying for about 6 good songs on a 17 song cd, pick this one up. and hope UL will go back to the kind of stuff they put out with their self-titled"
5,KICK ASS!,"this cd is one of the best i've ever bought. great lyrics, beats, and a hot lead singer what more can a band ask for? they all are doing a great job so keep it up guys your cd kicks [butt]!!!!"
1,"This album [is bad]. Of course, Teenyboppers will love it.","If you heard the black album or either of UL's two album's before that one, you would have to agree with me that this album outright [is bad]. Not even one good song on the entire CD. Lyrics are [awful]. The seeing red song is about a 3/10 compared to any older UL material. But I guess these days teenybopper pop-rock is popular amongst the younger generation. Definitely no longer a punk band. Go buy the self-titled if you wanna know what UL is all about. If you listen to talentless [music] like Sum 41 and Good Charlotte then perhaps you will like it. However, if you are a fan of punk music look elsewhere."
5,Houston we have a problem!!!!!!!!!,"Houston is doing it big. Slim thug,Pall Wall, Chamillionare and Mike Jones. All There albums are great. But Slim thugs sticks out due to the neptunes.Like A Boss wouldn't have the same attitude if the neptunes hadnt made the beat.1.Like A Boss2.Click Clack3.3 Kings4.Already Platinum5.I aint heard of that"

2,I got what I expected,"I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rapThis CD has almost no lyrical talentThe reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd."

4,Worked on my 2003 Chevy S10 4.3L,"Fits and works well but I am skeptical as to whether this part is actually OEM, Its packed OEM but looks aftermarket in my opinion. OEM is supposed to be 192F this thing is 195F, typical aftermarket spec..."
5,Get this CD!,"I hate typing in these forums but..., I had to after listening to Andy's music. Brings back lots of memories from the past when we used to hang out with the CREW. Good luck to you Andy and the best wishes. We all have to get back together some time and B/S. Awesome music!"
3,A Great Story...,"...but don't plan to use it as a reference. At 549 pages and 559 endnotes, this book needs an index. Even a Table of Contents would help. It has neither, a startling fault for a hard copy work of non fiction in the internet era."
3,"Interesting, but repetitive","The author obviously did an extensive amount of research to write this book. I can only imagine what it was like to listen to all of that tape.All of the writing dances around the truth of this book. These people spent months trying to get people to say a couple of sentences. Is that really that exciting?The main character seems to do the same thing over and over again. That also gets a little boring. The author also runs into the disclosure problem, being that it was an FBI investigation.If you want corporate intrigue/espionage, read Barbarians at the Gate... or Den of Thieves.... Even Liar's Poker...... before this one. If you have read all of those already.... try this one."
5,Terrific: Reads Like An Extended Wall Street Journal Investigative Article,"If you like the Wall Street Journal-style of investigative reporting on business issues, you'll enjoy this book as much as I did. Kurt Eichenwald, an award-winning journalist, does a superb job of meticulously reporting and weaving this tale of personal and corporate malfeasance. It's hard to believe this twisted tale is based on truth -- the Archer Daniels Midland Company price-fixing scandal and its prime actor, wonder-boy executive Mark Whitacre. Mr. Eichenwald says this book is about the ""malleable nature of the truth,"" and indeed there are many legal, political, technical, interpersonal and business twists and turns. If you like this style, it's a great read, as are most of his books, notably Conspiracy of Fools (about Enron)."
5,Sublime,"I'm a serious student of Japanese poetry and came across this book in a comparative literature class in college. I loved it so much that I bought another copy for my mom, who was maybe a casual reader of poetry at best, and SHE loved it. It's one of the most accessible poetry books I've found, and the translations read very smoothly. (The original Chinese text is included, which is helpful for students and other translators who would use it as a reference.)Another reviewer mentioned that there was a mistake in the translation, but having translated a significant amount of poetry myself, I have to say that there is no such thing as a perfect translation. Chinese and Japanese poetry contains a lot of allusions, word associations, etc., but these are sometimes left out intentionally because there is no way to render the exact nuance of the original without disrupting the flow of the translation and the mood of the overall poem."
3,Occasionally apathetic exotica,Typically technically impressive and overly-ambitious with all too familiar phrasings.
2,Not one of Al's better works,"Al DiMeola is no doubt one of my favorite musicians (regardless of instrument played). He is one of if not probably the best / most talented guitarist in the world. However, that said, this is not one of his better efforts. He should not venture too far into the ""World Music"" category. He is first and foremost a Jazz/Fusion Guitarist, and he should stick with what he does best."
2,Review of Strategic Denial and Deception,"This is a mediocre book. First, it resembles a handbook, teaching practitioners how to conduct D&D; (this acronym really exists). Second, many authors are in the ""neo-con"" school of intelligence officers, along with Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith.It's somewhat deceiving for a book to represent D&D; when the Reagan-era ""Team B"" school from which they graduated has been discredited."
3,a great disappointment for the true fans..,"back in 1984 the CASSETTE version of this album included their best recorded material originally found on their first two 12"" singles. tracks such as ""Matters of the Heart (dun diffrunt)"" ""You are a Hoover (dun diffrunt)"" ""Hold Me Mother (extended)"" and ""Doot Doot (extended)"" are all absent from this cd, which makes it very incomplete and less than impressive. although the last track mentioned above can be found on some compilation cd's, the other three are still unobtainable anywhere, and could be lost forever if nobody does anything about it.."
2,Starts off great but not for long...,"I was reading all these reviews and finally figuered out what was going on with my hair dryer. I was wondering why it was always turning off. They should put that somewhere. I thought it broke. And I only have had it for a month. Works well, but I don't want something to keep shutting off on me. Price is good, but I learned my lesson and recently bought a better one."
2,Powerful dryer--maybe a little too powerful...,"I've had this dryer for a little over a year. In the beginning, the hot setting made the dryer emit a rather disturbing burnt plastic smell, but since I never needed to use that setting given how hot the warm setting is, it wasn't much of a problem. But after a year of use, the warm setting is beginning to emit the same burning smell! The last thing I want near my head is something that smells like it's about to catch fire. I'll be replacing this dryer. My other complaint is that, from the beginning, the ""cool"" setting (and thereby the cool shot button) isn't all that cool. It won't ""freeze set"" your hair as it claims."
2,So-so,"PROS: Hair dries FAST! Lots of power. High heat. Lots of heat/speed settings. Housing looks nice.CONS: Shuts off everytime it gets too hot. (Which is good I suppose... if you are concerned with overheating. But for me it would die in the middle of getting ready for work. It cost a lot of time waiting for it to cool and click back on.)FINAL NOTE: It completely died!! Granted, I used it almost everyday for a year or more. But today when I went to use it, it just wouldn't turn on. Totally dead. :(DECENT DRYER FOR THE PRICE. BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE, TRY SOMETHING BETTER."
3,reputable brand but too hot to handle,"I have had my Conair translucent dryer for over a year (and I blow-dry daily). Pros- hair dries FAST due to the SUPER heating elements. It's lightweight, and not as loud as some dryers I've used. The filter snaps on and off easily, so a quick cleaning is no problem. Not many dryers come with three heating options (four, when you count the cool shot button) AND three speeds, as this one does.That said, the cord is really thick and often rolls up on its own--annoying--plus there's no hang loop. The heat is almost too hot. It sometimes smells like the plastic is melting. I definately wouldn't recommend this to someone with fine or damaged hair."
1,Too much,I really didn't like this hairdryer because when I did useI felt like my hair was singed. On top of that it made myhair frizzy with flyaways. I definetly would not recomendthis dryer.
1,Not so impressed,"I used this dryer and loved it for about 2 weeks then the heat went out on it. I brought it back and got a new one(the same kind) and now 6 months later it won't even turn on. I am done with these dryers, they keep breaking."
1,Not for short hair,Both items a much too large for medium and short hair Sorry I purchased it. Will give it to someone with long hair.
5,Can't live without my hot air brush,"I bought my first Conair Hot Air Brush 15 years ago and I haven't been without one since. My old one finally died recently, so I bought another. If you have curly or frizzy hair, these are fantastic for smoothing and giving a nice shape/style. More body than using just a flat iron."
4,Works well,"I recently let my hair grow longer, and with fine hair was afraid how to stlye it. But this helps me, and is easy to use, works well."
1,Broke on me first time I used it!,"Took it out of the package, started to use it. I noticed it was a little wobbly, like it wasnt fully together. I went to take it off and the whole thing just came apart, bristles and all!!! And a piece was broken off the head, so couldnt put the other brush on. No, I honestly do not believe this was a user error.. Just be cautious I guess but I would not recommend to anyone"
5,Great Product,"I was getting ready for a trip to Europe and I really needed a dual voltage hair curler.So I found this on Amazon, and ordered it. I contacted the merchant to deliver it asap in time for my flight,and it was delivered within two days.I have not tried the appliance on my hair yet, since I have braids now, but I tested with the 250 voltage, and it works.Except you can only use the Low heat/speed button with 250v setting.But I am very eager to use it soon to see how good it will work for me."
2,smells like mildew,"I love this product but when I turn it on, it smells like mildew. It must be either old or was stored improperly."
5,Prime delivered on a Sunday at a hotel!,This is a high quality product that is somewhat hard to find and is priced very reasonably but that is not why I am writing this review. I am writing this review because of how it was delivered. I have Amazon Prime and ordered this on a Friday. It was important but I was going to be out of town and the listing said that it could be delivered on Sunday so I had it sent to the hotel. Sure enough I picked it up in the hotel lobby 2 days later on Sunday! I have never had a shipment arrive on a Sunday much less at a hotel at no cost and even the item was a bargain. That just really impressed me. 5 stars all around.
2,Does not heat up like older/similar Conair models,"I purchased this curling brush to replace an almost identical model (only difference I could see was color) that I used and loved for a few years. Unfortunately, this model does not heat up enough to create the curl and body my old Conair hot brush did so well. I have normal, straight, medium-thick hair which ""takes"" curl easily. This is a disappointing product since I have always used Conair curling brushes and irons in the past."
1,to late to return but it blew up,"I had one of these and loved it. I got a new one as a ""back up"". I ended up giving my old one to my sister. When I went to use the new one it popped and fizzled and smoke came out of it. I wanted to return it but it only is returnable for 30 days. SO disappointing!"
2,Not for coarser hair,This styling tool doesnt work on thicker curlier hair like mine. Probably heats to a 100 degrees - way less than the 140 I normally need. Took close to 10 days to ship. Not worth the money.
3,Conair Hot Air Curling Cumbo,It brought out the length of my hair giving it more body. It is not applicable if you need curly hair.
4,As described,As previous purchasers stated a little underpowered but works well and does a good job. I would recommend for the price.
4,Excellent,"Although slightly more expensive, I'd say this water is certainly worth the extra cost. I've been looking for a supplement water without flavoring for quite some time, and I've found the perfect specimen in the Glaceau Smart Water. As a highly active individual, there was a noticeable change in my energy level with the addition of the water to my routine (as compared to regular water). For a fairly inactive individual, I'm unsure as to how significant the difference may be, but at the very least, this product is refreshing and nourishing. Now, if only it had vitamins in it in addition to the electrolytes..."
4,The Mothman Prophecies,"Defenetly you are ""in"" for a surprise. I like both CD's. You can closed your eyes and be transported to another world."
3,"Haven't Read yet, will eventually read",Used as reference materials to be studied at a date of my own choosing. Will use this as a reference to study translations.
3,Keens mens Newport review,The Keen Newport sandal that we were sent had a factory defect in it....a bubble or a gap between the leather and the rubber. It was uncomfortable for my husband to wear and break in.
5,2nd pair,Bought for my husband... I bought the first one too. He really loves it and the first one lasted 7 years.
4,nice little watch,"Hubby likes it very much, compass not much but didn't buy it for that. Came fast and was just what he was looking for!"
2,"Might be better to buy one pretty good paring knife, instead","It's hard to turn down anything with the name ""Wusthf"" when it looks like a bargain -- at least, it's hard for me. And the idea of three speciality paring knives certainly appealed. Nevertheless, the low price caused me to lower expectations to a level that I thought would be realistic. I didn't lower them enough.The knives have no heft at all. The blades seem terribly flimsy. Grasping the light plastic handles provides no sense of control. These aren't impossible to use; i simply make a point of using almost anything else.Thinking it over, I probably knew that this deal sounded too good to be true, even with the Wusthf name on the package. Instead of buying three mediocre to poor knives at this price, it would be better to put the money towards a single pretty good paring knife."
3,Fine for what it is,"I bought this for my daughter who likes Harry Potter almost as much as I do. It's a fine sticker book, but nothing to really play with. I didn't spend much money for it, so it's fine, but I definitely wouldn't spend a lot of money just to add it to your Harry Potter collection."
2,They Wear Out Quickly!,"I think the shoes look great. They were exactly what I was looking for. They aren't comfortable, but they're not exactly uncomfortable either. My major problem with them is that they wore out rather quickly. I've owned these shoes for 6 months now and I wear them about 3 times a week. The tread on the shoes is nearly gone. They are quite dangerous when walking on wet surfaces. I would not recommend these shoes unless you plan on replacing them in 6 months."
4,Docker Glacier shoes,I have very wide feet and have been wearing these shoes for years. They are cost effective and wear well in my daily life as a newspaper reporter.
2,A bit disappointing,"I bought this album because I really liked Kindler's ""Across A Rainbow Sea."" The sound is the same, but the thrill is gone."
5,A spider's work is never finished.,"Helen the spider finds herself a new home at the zoo. She finds plenty of flies to eat. It's too bad the zookeeper doesn't realize that her presence is a benefit to all the animals to the zoo. It's almost too late when the zookeeper finally acknowledges the need to take care of Helen because of her valuable work.I remember my mother reading this Weekly Reader Children's Book Club book to me as a child. I have always remembered to ""be nice to spiders."" This is a fun little tale to keep kids looking for the value of small things in life."
3,"Fun to watch, right up until they forgot an ending.","I absolutely loved this movie. I'd expand on this, but there's nothing I could write that someone else hasn't; there's a lot of reviews.I really did love this movie... Up until the end... It was as if they just... Forgot to write an ending and only realised it after they'd smoked an entire bag of dope each and decided to throw one together before sobering up."
3,boring,I just finished reading this book and was very disappointed with it. He tell everything that happen through the whole trial. All of this could have been left out and then at the end of the book all he writes is the jury knew Ken had killed his wife. Then he just ended the book. He didn't say what the sentence was or how long he will have to serve. This is a very important part of a true crime book'
1,zzzzzZZZZZZZZ,"I couldn't finish the book. It was so tedious that I fell asleep. If you want a good true crime try: ""Scream at the Sky"" by Carlton Stowers, ""Salt of the Earth"" by Jack Olsen or any one of John Walsh's books."
2,Shameful ...,"I have to put in my five cents on this and echo the fact that:1. $17.99 is too much money for 22 mins of cartoon2. $11.99 is too much money for 22 mins of cartoon3. Shrek already has a bad enough reputation due to parts 2 & 3.4. This 22 min EPISODE of Shrek will be on TV endlessly this year.5. And the next year, and the next year, and the next .... sigh.6. It's already available on youtube. Please, Dreamworks.7. While the story is 'fair', but not great, this is just pandering all the way around.8. A one-hour special wouldn't have killed them or strained Dreamworks resources in the slightest.9. It's an EPISODE and not a movie and shouldn't be priced like a film at all. $5.99 would've been appropriate.10. This would've been included as a freebie or an additional disk if they would've released 'Shrek Goes Forth'.... ..."
5,Shrek the Halls,I have all the Shrek movies and this one did not disappoint me. I really liked it along with all the rest of them.
3,Very good but too short,"This dvd has all the fun characters for Shreks 1,2 and the third. My kids and I enjoyed watching it. We were so disappointed however on the length. It could have been at least an hour long. ONLY 22Min!!"
2,"Eh, the kiddies will like it at least","As usual this movie had its witty writing and mostly typical character responses to keep it entertaining, but it isn't going to be a holiday favorite in my house. I love the Shrek movies (Shrek 3 being an exception) and I was going by previous reviews to decide whether I should shell out the bucks to buy this movie. Many reviewers said it was overpriced. It is. I thought the 30 minutes would be valuable, but they weren't; it was definitely rushed. Fiona's response to Shrek's anger over having their first Christmas crashed by their rowdy, obnoxious friends was more annoying than usual because it was overly dramatic and makes her character look weak, in my opinion. Overall, I'd advise you to pass on purchasing this movie for more than $5. And you can definitely find better movies than this out there for $5 if you know where to look."
1,Potty Humor In A Christmas Cash-In,Originally when this was broadcast on TV it was promoted as a new classic Christmas story - a laughable concept. Couldn't the writers leave out the burping and farting? Were they so at a loss for humor (or storyline) that they have to get laughs out of kids with toilet humor? This DVD is garbage. My kids enjoy the 1960s stop-animation movies narrated by Burl Ives: The Land Of Misfit Toys and such. THOSE are the classics! Shrek The Halls is a Christmas cash-in that teaches nothing about what the Season is TRULY about. F-
5,Excellent book!,Excellent book that changed the way for me to start hunting in the best way you could ever imagine!. Basics and advance tool to analyze and be prepared for your hunting time.
4,Close to the real thing,"My daughter likes to cook with me, even at 2. So these pots allow her to ""cook"" with me and use tools that are her size and control the spill amount in her quest for helping mommy and being independent. She enjoys them."
4,A Good Basic Public Speaking Book,"OK it is a given that the jokes and humor are dated and not on the cutting edge for today's audiences but the basics are there to create presentations that could be very effective. The author Robert Orben was a top humorist in his day and he has insight on ways to handle public speaking that make sense even in today's world.I used the book as a guide and ""rebuilt"" and ""reworded"" jokes and ideas to update them to be in tune with the time we now live in. There is really some great advice given about speak making in general. I think if you are anyone who has to make public talks on occasion or all the time - then you should have this volume in your personal library as a resource. It is a good investment."
1,"""No Sale & Refundable""","The audio tape by Romance Alive was one of the worst I have ever experienced. It was so abridged there wasn't much of a storyline, let alone a plot. If the editors had put more emphasis into keeping a storyline rather than trying to condense the book into one cassette, the story might have made more sense instead of a choppy rendition of missing parts-what were the editors thinking of, trying to save trees? I felt like I was in a black hole trying to make sense of nonsense or at a three act play in which only one act was performed. But given the editing quality of the audiobook, I suspect the book in its entirely isn't much better. I've purchased books by Rosemary Rogers, some of her earlier works I have really enjoyed which were well developed in plot and style. I haven't purchased any of her newer books finding them disappointing. The Tea Planter's Bride is a definite ""No Sale"" and should be refundable to anyone who purchased it."
5,Fantastic information for coaches,Frans Bosch is one of the foremost experts in the field of motor learning. This DVD is a great introduction to his theories/philosophies and shows how to apply them to athletes of all levels. A must buy for anyone who works with athletes or people who want to learn how to run.
4,Laughable Incandescent / Very Useful Fluorescent,"Just got it and really like it. The Fluorescent illuminates just like I had hoped it would. Should be excellent for my attic, undersink and crawlspace uses where portable non-spot lighting is needed. The incandescent is pretty much useless but I don't care. I'd like to see a LED version but I doubt it would produce such nice even lighting. Complements my LXT battery investment."
5,"Sweet, bright, tough, rechargeable, fluorescent, work light","I already use the Makita LXT line of cordless tools so this one was a no-brainer. Lasts probably 6 hours, super bright LED kind of crystal white tint, I use it for every car job in the garage. Beats a corded work light any day. Not running over a cord with my creeper or causing paint damage on fenders from a cord dragging along it is priceless to me."
1,disappointing,"I have the other Makita lxt tools and bought this light since so many batteries are nearby and available. This light belongs at 'Dollar General'. Clumsy design. Switch button difficult to operate, cycles thru on/on/off and is easily left on when you come in from the dark. The flourescent mode burns the same hours as the BML185 zenon but is not nearly as bright. It's a 'flood' as opposed to the 'spot' of the 185 and a cooler light temperature. Flimsy construction. A strap bracket is molded at the top of the grip and chafes the soft part of your hand at the base of the thumb. I wear XL gloves so perhaps my hands are too large, I dunno. The lxt tools are great, I have 3 drills, etc. But this flourscent light should sell somewhere for about $4.99 ..... without the Makita name."
2,cordless fluorescent/incandescent flashlight,"I purchased this flashlight two years ago, and it has served me well, but recently the fluorescent bulb burned out, making the light useless to me. I went to Home Depot to replace the bulb, and after three different trips and three different bulbs I finally called Makita. As it turns out, Makita used a specific bulb you can only purchase through them at a hugely inflated price, plus shipping, plus the time spent waiting for the part, and plus the aggravation I went through to discover the fact in the first place.While I like that the light is rechargeable and fits in nicely with the rest of the Makita tools that I own, I am disappointed in the customer service that I received, and I am very disappointed that Makita chose to use a proprietary technology on a wear item and that that item is hugely overpriced and hard to get."
1,much smaller than I realized,I did not realize from the posting how small this backpack is... it looks like it is for toddlers!!! I would not recommend this unless you are buying it for a 3 yr old.
3,"Cute, smaller than expected but handy","The product came very quickly and the communication from the seller was excellent. I read one of the previous reviews that the drawstring lock broke within a week, so I was cautious when closing. The leather felt really soft, surprising for the price, but I found myself carrying too much in it, as it was a bit smaller than expected. Subsequently, after about couple of months of use, one of the straps gave in.This bag gave me the idea to look for backpack purses to replace a traditional carry on your shoulder type. I think I will be more willing to shell out a bit more for a higher quality, but all in all, great value for the price. It might last you longer if you don't try to sub it for a shopping bag like I did :)"
2,Leather Backpack Purse,The purse was smaller than I thought it would be. It hardly holds anything. I was not impressed with it.
5,Awesome book!,Jack Kerley is one of my new favorite authors! I got hooked on Kerley with the Death Collectors and then bought his first book - The Hundredth Man - And it was as good as his second novel. A Garden of Vipers (his third) was also EXCELLENT! Can't wait for more Carson Ryder novels to come out.
5,Lose Weight Without also Loosing your Humor,"Losing weight is such a serious matter that we usually will end up losing our Humor. That is what makes this book so different to anything you could have previously read about dieting and weight loss. Janice Taylor's ""Our Lady of Weight Loss: Miraculous and Motivational Musings from the Patron Saint of Permanent Fat Removal"" puts a differing spin on how to lose those extra pounds and even more important keep inspired to actually keep the weight off.Both inspirational and funny, this book may be what you just need if you have tried everything else and have been unable to keep on track in any diet because the hunger makes put you in terrible bad mood. Get a copy this is not your regular diet book. You absolutely won't regret it after you see the results. Lose the weight, not the humor !!!"
4,Awesome!,These are the best earphones I have ever bought! Great noise isolation and the base is awesome for listening to MP3s. If you love base you should get a set of these. I am pretty satisfied with the product with the exception of the wire. I like wires where the left is shorter than the right and they wrap around the back of your head instead of the front. These wires are even length unfortunately.
2,Diappointing,"I've had many earphones, from headsets to ear buds, and I must be honest: these are probably the most disappointing I've ever purchased. They don't fit well, even though three sets of plugs are included, but most annoying is the ""hollow"" echo sound of the cords reverberating when they hit clothing or rub against you. Although the sound itself is fine, I would NOT recommend these at all."
2,Headphones,"The headphones work as detailed and were shipped in a timely manner. The problem I had is not with the sender, it is with the quality of the product. where the earbud chord meets the jack, the wires are loose and separating from the jack. this is not what I would expect from creative. Also, the sound quality is not really up to snuff, unless the volume is turned up alot and the plugs are really deep into the ear."
5,Perfect for my office.,These wire baskets work perfect in my office. They are deep enough to hold books and papers and I like the fact that I can see what items are in the basket even if they are at the bottom.
4,good quality material,Bag is made of good quality material.Only thing i didn't like was the mesh for holding basket ball was a bit small .
5,Great Gym Bag,"Great gym bag, plenty of room in the main compartment, best feature is the wet compartment, keeps everything in the main compartment dry and doesn't retain residual moisture from day to day use. The front accessory pouch is small but more than adequate for a 1/2 dozen components, I keep my lock, iPod, brush, keys and shower toiletries comfortably. Only potential negative I observed were the zippers, better than most but due to the saddle shape configuration of the main, more likely to get stuck/snagged over time, and has happened several times already."
5,Larger than expected,"Too big for me as a regular gym bag, but the perfect size for my boxing gear. Fits shin guards, boxing gloves, towels, change of clothes, various wraps and MMA gloves. Love the separate section for wet items, which is what I originally got this bag for, but it's far too big for regular gym use (bathing suit, towels, shoes, swim gear). Lovely purple color! (I get lots of compliments!)"
4,Great bag for the gym!,"I bought this bag for the gym. Usually I carry a pair of spin shoes, flip flops, sneakers, and my work shoes/clothes. I also have a small toiletry kit and my hair brush. Everything fits in this, and the outer mesh pocket is perfect for my bag full of dirty clothes. I use the bungee on top to carry my yoga mat.I would highly recommend this bag for the gym user. The color is really cute and uplifting!The only thing is that I wish it came with an additional outside pocket that I could use for my water bottles. The outside pocket on the bag is perfect for your keys, iPod, etc but not quite big enough for sunglasses in a case."
3,"Lots of pockets, good build - but much smaller than it looks",This is a great bag if you don't need a lot of space. But at this price I was expecting more. Should've carefully looked at the picture with the basketball at its side - that's probably not even a full-sized basketball. Ended up returning mine (Amazon is excellent in that aspect!)
3,Lacking depth & redundant,"This is a quick read but not fulfilling for those of you who saw the story on HBO's ""Autopsy 6"" and were looking for more. A large majority of the book is excerpts from news articles and Tanzler von Cosel's diary, so the author did little in depth writing. I would have liked to have known more about the childhood of Carl von Cosel and there was just NO real investigation into it. St. Martin's churns out fast true crime stories and doesn't require much investigative reporting in my opinion. I am 32 and have been reading true crime since I was 11, and this publisher turns out some real cheese, including this one."
1,Don't Buy!,"I needed one for some auto work and this was an option, but honestly this is a just a cheap product-GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE-they always carry these and they are a dollar! This is way to expensive for the quality. If it were cheaper than higher rating, but for the price it is not worth it!"
4,Ty Beanie baby,The item is very cute. It is being used as a school mascot toy and works well for this.
3,Small handle,"The head of the brush is good. The head size makes it great for brushing small dogs, and the pin length worked great for my Havanese, Shih Tzu, and Wheaten Terriers. But the handle is too short for me to hold comfortably, and my hands are just average woman's size, certainly not large. I could have used another 2-3"" length on the handle to get the grip and leverage I wanted."
4,Helpful seaside designs,"From living in the Caribbean, I've been searching for floor plans which reflect caribbean style and architecture. This book had some nice designs that make use of sunny climes with sweeeping galleries and large windows of the back. But I agree with one of the other reviewers, the book is named ""cottages"" yet many plans are for 2 story and larger homes. I'll continue my search for bungalows. But this book was still helpful."
2,Terrible! don't waste your money!,"Very thin wood. Dog house was falling apart before I even got it put together! Hole is so big in the frobt it offers no wind or protection from the cold. Floor just sits in and buckles after a few uses. Three heavy rains and the roof is buckling in 2 places. Black paint around trim fading after only a month. This dog house is pretty to look at, but if you want a heavy, well insulated house for your dog, don't buy this unless shade is all your dog needs it for."
1,The worst live Al Stewart album,"Well, anyone that knows Al live discography will agree. Blue album is magistral. Indian summer is correct, but this is monotonous and bored. The version of NOSTRADAMUS is the worst never edited. The spanish guitar in ON THE BORDER hasn't the feeling that original, YEAR OF THE CAT is sung without conviction, and where is ROADS TO MOSCOW?"
1,This is awful,"I thought this toy would be cute since my boys like Mighty Beanz. But, it is very cheap, difficult to set up and the beanz don't travel well on it. We threw it out the same day we got it."
3,Powerful but not distinctive,"Things go just as they should until the end of the third movement: the appropriately weighty first movement, the felicitous scherzo and the adagio that flows smooth and nice. The final movement isn't bad, that is, not until you hear Norman Scott. His singing is way too operatic that it sounds totally out of place. Nicholas Di Virgillo is not much of help, either. His singing lacks power almost to the point that it sounds comical. The final nail in the coffin is the Julliard Chorus that sounds decidedly small. It really is the singers and the chorus that let the side down in this performance. Too bad when the rest of the symphony goes rather well. The performance itself isn't bad all on the whole but I do suggest that you go for his DG remake with Vienna Philharmonic as THAT truly is the 9th for the ages."
1,Off the Beaten Path? Try how to spend the most money in AK,this book is full of overpriced advertisements and we found this book completely irritating in a 6 week trip to Alaska. If you want to spend $3500 on a kayak trip this may be the book for you.
5,Effective,Effectively reduces lime after one application. One bottle's worth will do the trick. Can't find it anywhere except online. Keep it available.
4,Good Product,"Easy to clean and store. compact. case closes with difficulty around utensils sometimes, but no major problems."
3,A quick helpful overview/ESRI sales brochure,"GIS for Health Organizations gives a very nice overview of the uses of GIS in the health environment. But, it does also seem to present mostly projects that use products developed by ESRI (which makes sense since they also publish the book). So, this book begins to seem like an ESRI brochure that you had to pay for, especially since the demo software included does not use the examples from the book. Overall, it is a nice quick reference of current uses for GIS, for the numerous programs that ESRI has helped develop for health care operations, and to get a quick overview of one of the GIS software applications on the market. A look at the ESRI website may yield the same information though, so actually buying this title may not be for you."
4,workhorse laser printer,"I have a fleet of these printers in use at my workplace.I am the resident IT guy and this printer has outperformed every other desktop laser we have tried.Although a bit slow by today's standards this unit is built much better than current model printers.I have also found that the toner cartridge in this unit will run upwards of 5,000 pages while the newer P1006 toner costs much more and only puts out around 1,500 pages. So for half the money in toner you print twice as much...not a bad gig if you can forgive the speed a little bit.if you are buying these units check with HP regarding a separator pad upgrade.They were free for a time.Basically the skid pad that separates the paper as it is fed in gets worn and the printer tends to double feed.After I did this upgrade to my units I was pushing 100,000 pages printed on some of my machines.HP is well known for its reliability, hands down I recommend them."
2,Old Hee Haw DVD,"30 years ago I thought the show was mildly humerous, seeing the DVD now shows just how ridulous it was with it's corn ball humor. Would probably only appeal to our redneck population."
1,It could have been so much better,"The World Records in this book are sometimes only a paragraph long.Get the 1999 edition or watch the show every Tuesday,Saturday and Sunday night.My favorit record on the show was were the yogi fit into a tiny box and was submerjed in water in it for six minuits!However it was on tv live one night.The first record was the longest a person was set on fire without oxygen which was a little more than I minuit and tightrope walking with a blindfold on."
1,this book is the worst example of damsel-in-distress ever!,"I was really looking forward to a good van-damme flick, and this book completely let me down!"
1,ridiculously complicated,"I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who found this thing impossible to program. I spent a few hours with it, then left it in a drawer for about 6 months before trying again. I at least got the ""daily"" program to work - counting steps and km, but don't dare try anything else for fear of resetting the whole thing. And even if you do figure it out, it's so totally unintuitive you'll forget it the next time you need to set something. DEFinitely, but something else!"
1,Terrible vendor,"The seller said it was in stock, but didn't ship it for 2 weeks. I needed it right away and paid for expedited shipping. Took about 2 months for Amazon to refund my money."
5,love's long lourney,bought this movie for my wife she says it is very good I would not know it is not my kind of movie anyway really can't say much more then the other reviews have already said about this.
5,Finally a TALENTED ACTRESS !!!,"Anyone who has lamented the absence of January Jones (for even a second) is quite possibly insane. The performance delivered by Ms. Cottrell was excellent. Because it was just THAT: a performance. January Jones vapidly stood in front of the camera like the proverbial deer in headlights. I think that if they are to continue making movies from this book series, bringing on Erin Cottrell to lead the cast was an excellent choice. Bravo to Erin and the rest of the cast."
2,"Like an extended average Little House on the Priaire episode,","but more preachy and cleaner, everything on the set looked like it just came out of the washer. I wouldn't watch it,again."
5,wonderful movie,I saw this movie on Lifetime and it was so wonderful that I bought it. Amazon has a great price for it and I got the three other movies in the series with it.
5,EXCELLENT TRANSACTION!,"This DVD is part of the Love Comes Softly series, of which I am an avid fan. I purchased this DVD to add to and help complete the entire series."
5,This book was a well written life after death story.,"The Recycling of Rosalie was an absolute pleasure to read. Patricia McLaine displays deep isight of what life after death could possibly be like. It is a love story about how love is eternal, and how there is one true love that holds the key to our soul wherever or whenever we may be. Reading this treasure gives you hope for true love that is everlasting. It is a real treat to explore and I highly reccomend it to anyone with a dream."
2,Ordered wrong!,Not as pictured there are two types of long points the short long point that works great and then there is this one no one likes so it shown as the shorter of the two!
3,baby ready,Looks adorable and colors are great. Material very cheap and after washed it shrunk and sheet barely fit mattress and tore in several places.
5,Absolutly adorable,"I'm a mom to an almost 3 yr old boy and have been a tom boy most of my life so when I found out I was having a girl all I had in my head was visions of pepto pink all around. The thought of that almost sent me to get the pepto. I went on the search for something that said ""girl"" without being over the top in pink, this was it!!!! I have bought almost everything that goes with the set and my little girls room is perfect. I was able to find paint that matched both the purple and the green and her room looks like a little girl's room without being bathed in pink. Needless to say I LOVE IT!!!!!"
3,Check the merchandise,"While the deal was terrific (umbrella and stand for a great price), the stand's plastic handle was broken. Make sure you check for condition as soon as your merchandise arrives! The stand is still functional and the broken handle (used to secure the umbrella pole in the stand) isn't visible unless you look under the table."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I bought this item about two months ago, and since then it has just been collecting dust on one of my shelves. I tried and tried but it simply doesn't work. Try a different one."
1,Conair brushheads,"These were shown in the Amazon catalog and looked like the NT7,but in fact, they were a different model and so were useless."
1,Old and outdated,I wonder why are you selling old parts that do not fit? You should have warned your customers that these heads are for model that was available in 1990s and not lately.I feel like I was cheated.
2,"Not sure of operation, but was made of cheap plastic","From the look of this phone, I was hoping that the phone would be more of a metalic quality. While some parts of the phone are metal, there is actually a lot of plastic. I took it out of the box and it just had that cheap feeling to it. I do not really return things often, but this went back right away. Nothing against the seller -- I received prompt delivery and processing of my return -- this is just not a high quality product. I must admit that I did not even plug it in, so I can not vouch for call clarity, etc. Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would not recommend it if you are looking for something of substance."
3,Cheaper than it looks,Nice looking phone but very cheap plastic construction. Mine broke afterabout 5 min and I sent it back.
2,80's Cheese......,"There's some art in it...but ultimately, it's painfully 80's without any of the guilty pleasure."
1,Pre-Release Rip Off,"I hope that they do another run of this SE at the normal price, so that the people who are paying these crazy prices are taught a lesson. The company not shipping enough units and then having faithful gamers buying these games and driving up the price only sends the message that gaming companies can get away with it and should do it more often. Next time you complain about a game costing $39 it will cost $60 because of clowns like these.I am holding on to hope for a second run of a computer game I really want, from a Demo I loved playing, but I refuse to play any real life games with them."
5,Better than all of the rest...AWESOME,"I've enjoyed the 2004 demo more than all of the other full versions combined. Now there's vehicles and onslaught gameplay. This is a nice ""Best Of"" mixture of Unreal with a little Tribes and some Halo. I can't wait for the full version."
2,Breaks easily,"I bought this set for the tea kettle and the different utensils. Those pieces have been great and my babies love to play with them. My complaints are about the pots and lids. First, the pots are not perfectly round. So the lids don't fit and fall into the pots. This frustrated my son so much that I had to take the lids away. Even worse, the small pot broke in the first half hour of play. My daughter fell down on top of it and the handle broke off and flew across the room. Of course, since I wanted the tea kettle and the utensils, I'd probably have bought the set anyway."
1,BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!,Pay attention to the reviews regarding this outfit's so called Support - There is none. I owned this product and following a computer crash could not get it to work with my Gateway notebook. I was in sheer desperation but Buslink would not respond to my communications - others have said the same thing - It's true - Stay away. When you need support it truly needs to be there - this outfit wasn't.
5,A seduction and titillation of your mind,I had a chance to see the performance of The Erotica Project: Sex at 19 at Joe's Pub in New York City and I am glad to find the original cast on this album. The material is very strong and literate but still leaves space for imagination and manages to create a stage atmosphere on CD. This is possible because of strong writing in combination with subliminal music. Every piece has its own identity. LOLA shows no regard for conservative ears on this CD. My favorite story is Black Clogs. I could not stop laughing. This material is a must for any collection because there is simply nothing like it! Believe me.
3,Bring Math Knowledge up to Date,"Before I retired in 2000, I was a Nuclear Engineer who used a lot of empirical formulas to calculate important quantities. I always wanted to know the basis of these ""magical"" formulas. This book provides a more up-to-date analysis than was available in my school experience. Gamow has done a wonderful job of translating from the Russian. One disadvantage of these classics is unfamiliar notation. I wish an appendix was available in each such classic to explain the notation. Reading would go much faster, even for us math buffs. When dealing with dynamic collections of little, identical things like neutrons, Stat Mech is a must!"
3,Thought provoking sociological examination,"I read skin for a sociology class focusing on women's issues and this one is quality.Allison really makes you think about how race, sex, and class relate and are interwoven together. If you're looking for a book to help you on your journey toward empowerment take a look."
1,don't go there!,Forget this one! the first fall from the tree and it is in pieces. The construction is entirely too fragile--only a very small wire holds it together inside and it easily falls apart. It does not matter if it keeps out the squirrels if the birds land and it crashes into smithereens.
4,Naturalizer Shoes,"These shoes are pretty comfortable, although they did leave a sore on my left foot, but perhaps it was just to get used to them. The price was definitely right! Half of what I would have paid in the stores."
3,Missing Parts,"This bedroom set is beautiful for the money but I ordered it a year ago and screws were missing for some of the handles and I called to get more screws and still haven't seen any. Then, I went to a hardware store to buy replacement screws but they are a special size that is not available in stores. If I had all the screws, I would give this a better rating because the set is gorgeous."
5,Great Ride!,"I just received this stroller and was amazed at how easy it is to handle. I have a two year old and another due very soon. We actually purchased the stroller through another website (since they offered a free rain cover and shipping for a few dollars less than here) and decided to get the grey/red color scheme which I really like since we already have a navy blue stroller (a Peg Venezia which we use and love).Since I already have a stroller with a small basket and no cup holder, it is not and issue that this one also is the same. The most important feature for me was ease of movement. We have tried many other strollers (both side-by-side and tandem) and this one handles the best, though I do like the Peg Aria too, but for the price, I decided the Twin Swift would be a better option for us.I can not comment on durability yet, but it seems very sturdy and the ride is great!!! I can't wait until number two gets here so we can use it."
5,Good Movie,This movie has been a favorite of mine for many years. I've always liked Victor Mature. I have it in VHS but was happy to find it in DVD. It was scheduled to arrive by Feb 3 at the earliest. I got it on Feb. 2.
3,Demetrius and the Gladiators,I liked it back in 1954 when I first saw it but the sound quality is rather poor. I have to turn my volume way up to hear the sound.
1,"Great movie, lousy DVD","While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal."
1,don't buy it,"This is a terrible movie - it would be bad enough if we hadn't read the book, The Robe, but because we did, the book portrays Demetrius as a thoroughy moral, loyal and admirable person, and the movie shows him as a pleasure-loving, vacant-eyed, immoral fighting machine. Where the movie makers came up with this spin is beyand me, but someone should have stopped them. Actually, after reading the book and 'knowing' Demetrius in that manner, I found the movie nauseating - like a crude and mean characture of a good friend.Don't buy it."
4,Excellent Biblical sequel!,"This movie begins with a clip from it's successful prequel, ""The Robe"", creating a feeling of nostalgia. The story here is marvellous, if not as good as it's prequel's. This time the attention is on Demetrius, the Greek slave freed by the Roman centurion Marcellus. Condemned to fight as a gladiator when he dares to attack a Roman soldier, Demetrius learns that the Christian path is a difficult one. When his lover is assaulted by other gladiators, he renounces his faith and lives the life of a Roman pagan. Later on, he realizes his mistake and leaves Rome and its riches to be with his people. There's lots of action and interesting characters in this movie. Jay Robinson as the eccentric Caligula and Susan Hayward as a high-class Roman femme fatale are fabulous. Thankfully,Christian values are not compromised. The story may appear slow-moving for a while, but it certainly gets better. You'll definitely feel good at the end of this movie."
4,If you liked Gladiator..........,If you enjoyed Gladiator or like Sparticus on TV you might want to add this to your collection. Victor Mature best know for Samson is again superb in this genre.
1,yuck!,"i dont expect much from protein bars, really, i dont. i've tried so many, and the more i try, the lower my expectations. but this is just crap. i couldnt finish an entire bar! on top its a strawberry jelly like mixture thats super sweet and i think its suppose to mask the flavor of the bottom layer of the bar thats bitter, unsweetened and just plain gross tasting. food is not suppose to taste this bad. no way."
5,Gunfighter book,A very nice compendium of the folks that made the wild west wild. A nice historical reference of who's who in the old west.
1,A connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,I would not reccomend this book because it was boring and confusing. I reccomend finding another book to read.
3,Not So Hot,I believe the suggestions are off-dated for today's competitive world.If one does not have such a good background then he or she may need alittle longer time to create personal networks. I hope the author hasan updated website with updated suggestions.
3,Good Doco,"This was a good lightning doco. I thought there would be a lot more shots of lightning in the sky and I was disappointed that there wasn't more. I wanted video shots of lightning to use in a personal video project totalling 6 minutes. There wasn't 6 minutes of video lighting ( out of over 50 minutes documentary time) in the Doco. Still, it was a good documentary. I'll go to UTUBE now that I have discovered it."
3,LOUD LOUD LOUD,"LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD sounds like a airplane in turbulence. Make sure you have earplugs. Also, this is my 1st time owning a 'featherlite' vacuum so I may be biased towards the more sturdy builds... but it seems like it's made of cheap plastic. I have a bad back, so it works for me now...but if I was healthier I would buy a heavier model. suction is great, everything is great except noise and material. I don't expect this to last more than a couple years at most....but hey it's $40 with free s/h what can i say lol it does the job...wear EARPLUGS or you'll become deaf lol"
3,You may need to buy earplugs with it,"I bought it because it is cheap...it does work well, may be better for the price I paid but the noise is difficult to deal with. My previous vacuum cleaner was a Kenmore and my 1 and half year old daughter used to think it is a toy play with it while it's on...this one scared her to tears as soon as I turned it on, and now she doesn't even get close to anything that looks like a vacuum cleaner :)"
1,3 Broken Belts in 5 months,"For the 3rd time, within approximately 8 uses of the vacuum, the belt has broken. I won't put a 4th belt on this piece of junk. I've had cheap vacuums before, but never one this bad."
1,this is junk,The bagless upright dirt devil is horrible when you go to empty it. You cannot get the dirt out without physically putting your hands in and pulling it out. The dust flies everywhere and chokes me up. I have had it 6 weeks and I'm willing to give it away to the first taker.
1,This item ....... WAS NOT NEW.,This item was....... NOT NEW.It has been USED then returned.THERE IS EVEN SOMEONES DIRT IN THE HALF FILLED VACUUM CLEANER BAG......THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE That someone would use a item then return it. And even more UNBELIEVABLE that Amazon would ship out a returned item with out checking it out firstI am so pissed right now.
2,Loud and Annoying,"We got this vacuum after reading the positive reviews and am sorry that we did. Our old vacuum, after about 10 uses, stopped picking anything up. Since we had lost the receipt and warranty info, we wanted to get a cheap, lightweight vacuum.We got it...""cheap"" being the key word. It does pick up debris off the floor....better than our last one did. But, any vacuum that works could do that. It is SUPER loud. My 2 year old son was not afraid of our old vacuum. He's afraid of this one.Also, every time I use it, it seems to flip a breaker switch...no matter where I seem to plug it in. I'm tired of having to go to the basement and switch a breaker back on every time I vacuum. We did not have a problem with our previous 2 vacuums.I haven't tried the attachments yet, but I'm afraid the other reviews are correct about them being difficult.Aside from the fact that it vacuums and it is light weight, I would not suggest this to anyone."
5,Vacuum is a must have,"I would definitely recommend this vacuum to anybody. My mom has one, I have one and my grandma has one. I'm not too fond of the bagless vacuums. My mom was the first one to purchase this vacuum and I loved it. I knew I had to get one for myself."
2,Featherlite?,"This vacuum cleaner works OK, but I specifically bought it for my 85-year-old mother because it was advertised as ""featherlite"" - but it weighs 12 pounds!!! That's a pretty heavy feather!!! Not light enough for an older person to use, that's for sure."
3,Disposable Vacuum,"The pin that holds the back wheel on became very loose .It is like a bolt with threads , but it does not unscrew . It has to be forced out . Then clean hole and use JB weld , put a peace of plastic wrap on pin next to wheel so wheel doesn't get glued . DISPOSABLE .From April 28 2010Pulls air thought bag , then to fan , so don't chip fan up . I have wear spots on carpet it auto adjusts to it . It's disposable or can take care of it . Bags cost more for it but , it leaves the air cleaner . Type A bag has same size hole . Other type U bags not the same . Only thing don't like is it runs very warm / hot. Hose could be longer ."
5,AWESOME,"I LOVE this product. Had one before and loved it but then it died so got a new one. I have 4 cats so it's no wonder they break down. I actually had 2 previous vacs like this and love them. Am thinking of buying one for the basement too. I hated the 'propelled' vacs and would never by a 'Wind Tunnel' vac again; hated that thing. I like the bags vs the bagless. I'm very very very satisfied with this wonderful vacuum. Would love to get, some day, the Oreck vac with the light underneath it but way to expensive for me so will wait till they come down in price. I think it's around $600."
1,Worst vacuum if you have pets and hardwood floors,The vent is in the front and before you vacuum the pet hair it blows it EVERY WHERE.Do not buy if you have pets and hardwood floors. I used it three times before looked on my mantle.It was covered in hair! I tried to give it away but had to disclose theproblem. Ended up throwing it away.
4,Great Value for the Price!,"I have, in the past, bought relatively expensive vaccuum cleaners. When my last one finally bit the dust (pardon the pun), I was at a point where I needed one quickly (with 5 cats!), and had very little money. I decided on this one, thinking it would ""do"" for now. However, I have been very pleasantly surprised by the amount of suction, the cleaning ability, features and quality of this machine! The upholstery brush really gets the cat hair off the furniture, and the edge cleaning is very repectable, too. My ONLY complaint is that the hose is very stiff... no real flexibility in its length. I would have given it 5 stars, otherwise. Other than that one flaw (which I will gladly live with), I have NO plans to replace this with a ""better"" one, and when it does die someday... I'll just replace it with another of the same!"
3,good second vacuum,"This is a good second vacuum. It is really loud, but works really well for the price. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but good for a vacuum for the upstairs."
2,Poor Quality,"I've had this product for 8 months now. While it is a good value at $40, there is one flaw with it. Over time the plastic piece at the end of the hose cracks. Therefore, the hose will come detached from the vacuum while in use. Very annoying."
1,Don't bother,"I know it was on the cheaper side of vacuums, but this vacuum seriously did NOT suck anything up. Not even fuzz. It only really worked with the hose part. I ended up buying a Bissel that was even cheaper then this Dirt Devil that pick things up so much better! This has been demoted for the car, since the hose has the only true suction on it. I wouldn't waste your money on this product, no matter how cheap it is."
4,Cheap little helper!,Great little machine for the price...suction is great...does the job that more expensive machines do at much less cost. Only limitation...sounds like an airplane in the room!
2,Dirt Devil Featherlite,So-so product. Suction about the same of a Mighty Mite vacuum cleaner. Plastic cord handles very cheap and broke off almost instantly.
3,handy but hard to clean,"This is a very handy size both for the microwave and the toaster oven.However, it is very hard to clean. I've taken to using SoftScrub cleanser on it, which works pretty well."
4,Cooling Comfort,"I purchased this cold pack after a recent back injury. I was looking for something that could cover the entire affected area. It freezes easily and stays cold providing relief for many minutes. I keep it in a pillow case in the freezer so it's ready to go. The only negative I've found is that it may be too big, but it folds easily in half even when it is frozen."
3,reuseable cold pack,Ordered two- one for work & one for Home. One started leaking a brown jell after a couple weeks. E-mailed cold pac but have yet to hear from them.
3,Too Small,"These ice packs are high quality, but the quarter size is just too small. If you want to ice your finger or wrist or ankle or something they might be alright, but if you ice any larger area they will warm up very quickly. The half size is much more usable and even that doesn't stay cold very long. I like how these things don't harden up, but if it's at the cost of staying cold then I don't think it's worth it."
3,B-o-r-i-n-g,"It was Peter Buck's involvement in the loose instrumental collective called Tuatara that first got me interested in them. I have the first two Tuatara CDs and thought they were moderately good. However, the new one, Cinemathique, is a real snooze. It's got a quasi-jazz flavor - the previous 2 discs rocked more - but this stuff is mostly like watered-down lounge jazz. There's one track, ""The Hangover,"" that sounds like the instrumental jam/break from some lost '70s song by the Chicago Transit Authority (not necessarily a good thing). Then there's the closing cut, a weak attempt at being avant garde. I can't imagine this disc appealing much to anyone. ..."
2,Santana: Santana,"Doesn't seem to compare with the 33 rpm vinyl record version!""Soul Sacrifice"" doesn't sound as exciting!"
5,One Of Santana's Essential CDs,"Santana's self-titled debut, along with ABRAXAS and III, is in a three-way tie for the best album ever by Santana. The best songs here are ""Evil Ways"", ""Persuasion"", ""You Just Don't Care"", ""Shades Of Time"", and ""Soul Sacrifice."" Organist-singer Gregg Rolie is as important an element to the album as Santana's lead guitar and the percussion of Chepito Areas and Michael Carabello. Rolie's and Santana's support for efforts to free people unjustly jailed in foreign countries, as well as for high-school community-service requirements, makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience, so start with this one, ABRAXAS, III, THE ESSENTIAL SANTANA, and THE BEST OF SANTANA, then move on to MOONFLOWER, LOTUS, and the later albums."
2,No Vista Drivers,"Bought this a bit more than a year ago, and it works well with my XP box. However, I recently purchased a laptop with Vista, and wanted to use my WD External Hard Drive to transfer some data over, but the drivers on the disk do not install, and on the WD website, there are no updated drivers for this drive. This is not acceptable."
1,Unreliable& undependable backup drive,"Number of reviews have been written about the problems with this drive. my addition;Drive and configration is unreliable, as a backup drive, it is not dependable. I bought two, one failed out of the box, the other is margional. If the drive failes to connect through USB to the system as disk drive, the software backes up the information on the C drive. Assume your C drive fails, backup you thought you bought is non existant. The reliability of the configration is many times worse then internal hard drive, and it has a questional backup software.I tried to get Western digital to help, I would have been glad to pay additionl money to understand the problem and have this beautifully packaged drive to work. No such ideas were forth comming. Enough, enough?????????????."
5,Works Great,I've had the 80Gb model for three years and wanted a second to store my photographs. This works very well and I'm quite pleased with both models.
3,Power supply slips off!,"I do not know too much about hardware or software, so I cannot say too much about it's performance.However, I have had this product for a month now, and I am absolutely shocked at how easily the power supply slips off the external drive. Even with just a simple lift, it comes off. Just a suggestion to keep this in mind if you do not plan to keep your drive stationed in one place. This is coming from someone who must travel around a lot with my external."
5,Fun and Moving,"I am a huge fan of all of Dorothy Gilman's Pollifax books and, of late, I have been enjoying rereading them for the first time in years. I had forgotten that the third book in the series, ""The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax,"" is not only fun and intriguing (like the others) but is downright moving. This is the first of the Pollifax books where the main character becomes more than just a quick-witted, eccentric, elderly spy and is elevated into a feeling, breathing person. Once again, a great book by Dorothy Gilman."
2,From Back Cover,"HIS HANDWRITING GAVE HIM AWAYLetter carrier Cassie Larue couldn't help drooling over the mail Andrew Bennett sent out. A student of handwriting analysis, she was intrigued by his penmanship...and by him. His dotted i's revealed a loyal nature. His crossbars exposed energy and responsivenes. And his downstrokes...!A man with strong convictions--and a deliciously seductive bent--he was someone Cassie could fall for in a big way...once she figured out how to meet him!"
2,Fun but cheaply made,"Both my boys (2 and 3) like to play with this toy. It was a Christmas gift from their grandparents (which I requested for them). My older boy likes to pretend shop, and it provides a lot of variety -- there are always things we ""need"" to buy, and we can use items from other toys (not just the small cardboard boxes that came with the toy). My younger boy likes the grating sound from the conveyor belt. However, it's hard to imagine anything more cheaply made. I was surprised at the low quality, given its high price. I would give this one star, but the kids like it. From now on, I will be a bit more cautious of the Learning Resources brand."
4,in the secret service,"book was rather interesting. went thru application process, screening and training. quite detailed. pluses and minuses for what it's about."
4,HOW TO:,"It's an interesting subject - got it for a friend, I did read it first though - really quick read with helpfull info; a little of it may be a bit base - but useful nonetheless."
4,Cool almost unknown Housemartins' clones,"I really like the stuff this band does, I'd recommend this band to all of you who liked the Housemartins, Billy Bragg, The Beautiful South. It's a very light album, and you can enjoy it on the first liste. As a reviewer pointed out, the first song is worth the album, but the rest is nice too. The guitar playing is very basic but also catchy, and the voice is very peculiar. They also remind me of the Violent Femmes at times, with the little and syncopated drum playing. If you like the band you can find more infos on them and on similar, almost unknown, aussie bands on candlerecords.com."
1,"Great idea, lousy product","The idea of a roll-on hot wax applicator is really great, especially the convenience of heating the wax by simply plugging it in. The lousy thing is, the wax gets kinda sticky and clumpy instead of hot and runny, ready to spread on the stubble and top with the strip before cool and rip ALL the hair out with a heartfelt holler, the way hot waxing should be. This is more like that washable wax or gel stuff, you might like it it if that worked for you."
2,"Great Idea, But Be Careful How You Handle It!","I bought this for my son to accompany his gamecube for Christmas. What better way to keep him occupied on the 1000 mile drive back from our relatives. Right out of the box, first time using it, I noticed that there were two rows of lines out of the display. 6 months later, the screen is riddled with lines missing! At first I thought I got a bad unit, but a friend of mine who is a big gamer said his is the same way. So much for the cheap way to have an entertainment center in the vehicle. . ."
5,fun for every 1,me & my sister luv dis product now we can play games while we go on vacation and n the car!! a must have!
1,I'd give it NO stars if I could!,"This is the worst. New from the package it did not work unless I pressed just so on the battery compartment. Then, once on, it sounded terrible and smelled like it was burning. I can't believe it's still on the market! Don't buy it."
3,Wrong product shipped,"Okay, So I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the product I received, but it's not what I ordered. Maybe the Christmas rush was too much for them. I received a different Corning Ware dish. Amazon quickly took the cost off of my credit card, so that's a plus, but I didn't have a Christmas present i was counting on. I ordered way in advance and received it way in advance. I checked the invoice and it was correct, so, unfortunately, I didn't realize the error until I went to wrap the present."
4,Liked the Birmingham connection,"As a latr side story to the Flame and Flower, I really enjoyed reading about this unexpected romantic pairing and also updating as to the characters in the Flame and Flower"
2,If you are a 16 year old girl you will love this book,"From the very start of the book I was uncomfortable with the youth of the characters and the implausibility of their situation. A 17 year old girl who is such an accomplished artist that she can sell her work for 1000s of dollars, a 25 year old young man who is so wealthy, apparently from his own endeavors, that he can spend 1000s of dollars without blinking. I kept waiting for something to separate them for 5-10 years so that we could all rejoin their stories as adults. No such luck. This book is a throwback to the 70s."
4,Another hit!!!,"I have been a fan since the '70's and will remain so. I've read reviews by some of the other readers of this book and I think the ones who stated that Beau had green eyes should read the first two chapters again. ""Beau remembers his childhood friend's hair and green eyes and Cerynise remembers that Beau had blue eyes."" I enjoyed this latest offering from Ms. Woodiwiss and look forward to her next book."
3,"Useful, but not super","These labels, when aligned correctly, can create a label for the hub of a CD or DVD. Unfortunately, the first label printed after loading the spool is often aligned incorrectly, wasting a label. Small file-folder labels are an adequate substitute."
2,"Review of The Hook, by Westlake","As much as I admire Donald Westlake's enormous talent, this latest release just doesn't cut it. The overall rather lazy treatment of the Proctorr character; the almost immediate and complete lack of any residual guilt or horror by the Prentice character over committing murder; the matter-of-fact acceptance of the murder by Prentice's wife and her cold-blooded decision to rent Proctorr's apartment; etc., etc. The whole plot just too pat and way, way superficial. I think Westlake was in over his head on this one. The best I can say for the plot is the gradual deterioration of Proctorr over the final portion of the novel - that wasn't bad, and the ending was brutally abrupt. But, a so-so read (I finished it because Westlake wrote it!) and shallow overall."
2,Tastelessly O.K. until the donkey shows up,"At least diector Neal Israel (Mr. Amy Heckerling) keeps this tasteless film moving (unlike some of his stillborn films such as ""Americathon,"" which gets a ""BOMB"" rating from Maltin & a ""WOOF"" rating from Videohound). The characters here are so obnoxious that I wouldn't want to spend more than 30 seconds in the same room with any of them. But the chaos is acceptably choreographed up to the point when the donkey is brought into the party -- at that stage, I thought that the ""creative artists"" responsible for this had so lost their bearings that they would have been willing to explicitly depict bestiality on screen if they had thought that they could have gotten away with it. I nominate the director & writer of this film to be contestants on the disgustingly unwatchable TV show ""Fear Factor."" At the very least they should atone by sponsoring a Preston Sturges film festival."
2,"""Party"" Elsewhere","Tom Hanks' second box-office hit was this formulaic comedy in the ""Animal House"" vein. ""Bachelor Party"" starts promisingly and Hanks delivers a likable performance. Once the actual party begins, however, things go downhill fast. Director Neal Israel would enjoy considerably more success as a co-writer on 1984's surprise smash ""Police Academy."""
5,Amazing story!,"If you are into science and biotechnology as I am, you will find this book to be a great way of entering that world. It describes the science simply and gets you excited about it, it shows you the business world beyond the labs and its complications. I loved the emotions that it spurred in me as I was reading it and thinking ahead on becoming a cog in the workings of science and technology."
5,The Billion Dollar Molecule - One Company's Quest...,"A thouroughly enjoyable read, Werth sheds light on the personaliteis and complexities of an amazing and multifaceted business. Throughout, the author uncovers the unseen deal-making, hand-wringing, and fist clenching that dominate the start of Vertex, a strucure-based paharmaceutical firm.I particularly enjoyed the background on the Boger-Schreiber collaboration and rivalry, and the ensuing rivalry in Vertex's own labs. Further, following the last few years of Vertex's ups and downs via the Internet has been thoroughly enjoyable.Werth's style is easliy read, and his obvious unhindered access to Vertex and its people make the story enjoyable, suspenseful, and dramatic."
2,Blue Matter,"CD is ok,at best, but not many hit selections on this CD and nowhere as good as the Hand Jive CD."
4,Good toy,"The plastic does feel lightweight, but this toy costs a lot less than some other toy schoolhouse sets. I got this because it was the most like the old Fisher Price schoolhouse. I don't like the new Fisher Price people, they all look obese. The chalkboard works great. I did have to glue the swing seat onto the swing bars, as it wouldn't lock in, and now it works fine. Came with six people which fit well into the the bus, school and playground equipment. Really, overall a decent little toy that my daughter, who is two-and-a-half loves playing with. Love the little button on top of the tower which dings a bell when pushed. Clock hands can be moved, also a nice feature."
1,Bad quality!,Toy broke on the first day and is bad quality. Way too big of a toy for the small about of interest my daughter showed in it!
2,"go buy SFII, don't waste your time here","this movie, although decent, doesn't do justice to what started back in 95' w/ Street Fighter II.If your a real street fighter fan, that movie is the holy grail... this one... ehhh, it's entertaining.This one should really have continued where that one left off."
1,crappy movie. period.,for a hard core street fighter fan like me i can easily say that this movie is bull****.go check out the movie or 2v and you will see the difference.shame on u manga.
2,Not Very Helpful,"This book was written with the sad misconception that a name itself can completely define your character- that's ridiculous. Who says a Bertha or Percy can't be daring, exciting, or sexy? Who says a Gertrude can't be a Dominatrix? I bought this book for the sole purpose of helping with my character's surnames- I have dozens of baby books that I can turn to for first names, thank you, but this book doesn't bother with surnames save for a handful for most nationalities. Beside that, I had to laugh when I read in the first chapter that the author actually named one of her characters ""Joe Q. Public"". In her ""suspense thrillers"". I'm sorry, but I've never read such a ludicrous name in MAD Magazine, let alone a serious thriller."
3,Not sure what I expected...,"I know I didn't expect this kind of story. My daughter and I had just finished the Walter Farley Black Stallion stories, saving this book as a good-bye to the series. We knew it had to do with Henry, how much we didn't know. Anyway, we start reading it and find Henry spending a summer with a horse taming older brother (Bill). Good so far, then it transpires into a good/evil thing between Bill and this other gentleman (Finn) Bill had worked with. I found the storyline annoying, over the top to read. Maybe it's just me. But the book lacked the usual Magic of the series."
4,vinyl luvin!,"it says ""vinyl love"" on the glove.. i work a mooring scow in the winter on long is. sound. perfect for working with fouled chain and moorings in sub freezing weather... the glove is a bit on the south side of rugged and although i haven't punctured it yet i think a barnacle may get the better of my hand soon... i do prefer the mobility- this glove is gold if your a clammer"
3,Waterproof but not warm,"I bought these gloves for winter jobs like shoveling or snow blowing. The gloves are not really lined heavily, and fingers get very cold. Dealing with the company, on the other hand was terrific. Very quick delivery; I appreciated that.Cold in Cleveland"
1,Disappointed,"I was really excited about buying this product. In fact it took me about 6 months to put it into our monthly expenses. I first bougth the hard mat which has a little ""soft mat"" that goes on the end. My husband, who is turning into a real spa person, tested it out first and was extremely disappointed. We had a very hard time keeping the suction cups down and the mat kept floating in the water. The sound was so loud it gave us a headache. I took it back and got the ""blue soft mat"". The same problems, floating mats, no relaxation. I did not like this product at all, I am taking it back today and getting the duo jets. Hope this helps."
1,Piece of junk,The worst thing I've ever bought. It started smoking on one of our trips we were afraid it was ruined but it still works . The brightness control is messed up and the volume doesn't work either.Do not buy or you will regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"LCD is Nice!, but...","this screen is cool because it makes the GC that more interesting. the only two things i don't like about the screen is that it is hard to see sometimes and it is like you have to squint and sit close. plus it seems like it has has a permanent glare. other than these small flaws, the monitor is relatively enjoyable.i rate it 8/10!!"
1,No hyperlinks to navigate,"Your Life is Worth LivingThank you so much for making it available in e-format. I've gifted the paper book version to a friend once, so i'm aware that it's an invaluable compilation. However it's only after i purchased this kindle version, that i realised it doesn't have hyperlinks within, unlike other kindle books i've purchased. Since it's a compendium, one would normally skim through the contents page to pick out a chapter that appeals to them at that point in time. Currently, it's really tedious to navigate through it as you can even enter page numbers to get to the exact page, you have to know ""location"" numbers. So the content page can't be used as a guide either, like you are able to in normal paper book. My humble request is to create an update with hyperlinks, so existing customers can download the update. Or at least mention it in the description, so potential customers aware. Thank you again for your service. God bless"
5,Great Book!,"I bought this book for my first grandchild because the photographs are colorful and unique to her ""hometown!"" The best part is the last page, which gives the locations of all the letters depicted in the book...I can't wait to take Olivia around town and show her where the ABCs came from! A wonderful companion book is 123-NYC also by J. Dugan."
4,Good fresh perspective on evolution debate,"I thought the book presented a fresh persective on the evolution debate from a European geneticist, and takes it in some new directions. Definitely recommended."
1,Another creationist diatribe against evolution,"Sorry, but this book opens no new doors of knowledge nor does it present any new evidence for the author's predisposition for creationism. It's just another ID/creationist oater."
1,Pathetic,If you really want answers to questions of this nature study biologyinstead of getting your head filled with this ideological non-sense.
2,Odd,"This is a very odd movie. No real story, just a series of happenings that are strange. Lots of unanswered questions... Worth $9 just to see an odd movie..."
1,unusable product,"I purchased this dvd to send to a friend in another city. He has since told me the dvd was stuck in the case, as if the plastic of the case had fused with the dvd. He was unable to remove it from the case. Eventually the dvd cracked and was unreadable. I am very sorry this happened, but I don't think I will order another dvd right now."
1,Mine just exploded! Dangerous and waste of money!,"At first I thought that this coffee maker was nice: pretty design and pleasant, though not hot coffee. Then this evening the carafe exploded--no joke!--while my son was holding the carafe about to pour the coffee. Glass and coffee went everywhere! What on earth! This is a potentially dangerous product. Save your money."
1,Lukewarm Coffee and burned Cabinets,"Bought at Costco. Used twice and returned. It says that you need to remove the carafe as soon as the coffee is done, otherwise the lid stays open and it gets cold. Even if you do that, it's at best lukewarm.It released a lot of steam, and since it's very tall, the steam scorched my kitchen cabinets.The idea of a thermal carafe is good, avoids burning the coffee sitting on a hot plate, but the design flaw is that you need to keep the carafe open while it's brewing, and as soon as it's done - with the top of the carafe still open - the coffee cools down. So you almost need to watch it until it's done, then immediately take the thermos off the base."
2,Not so impressed with this machine,"I used a Krups carafe machine at work, so thought I would try this one when I needed a new machine. The biggest problem for me was that I would set the timer and expect to have coffee.....in the carafe when it was done. 5 out of 6 times my coffee would end up sitting in the basket and never draining into the carafe. I had really strong coffee, but not what I wanted!! The pause and brew feature is obviously very sensitive and no matter how I placed that carafe, it didn't seem to recognize that it was there. Good thing I was only brewing about 3 cups at a time or else I would have had coffee all over the counter and floor.I would not recomend this coffee pot unless you love frustration."
2,I am so pleased!!!,I think this is a great coffee maker. My coffee was neither weak nor was it cold like some of the reveiwers complained. It kept the coffee hot enough for my taste for about 4 hours. I highly recommend it.UPDATED Coffe make does not stay hot. got the Zojirushu and love it
2,Not a Stroller for City Living,I purchased this stroller while still pregnant because of all the great reviews I've read. But no where was it ever mentioned the effectiveness on steps or public transportation. This stroller is in no way made for apartment living if you dont have a wheelchair ramp. I live on the first floor of a walk up building and have 2 short steps into the building then 4 steps to the first floor. Can you believe that the break gets engaged going up or down the steps and locks stroller onto step between step and footrest. I called the company and they said this stroller has to be totally lifted up and down the steps. How realistic is this? This has become the most expensive baby seat for in the house and can only be taken out when I have someone with me. I had to invest in a Mclaren Techno XT.
3,Disappointed,I like this stroller for all the obvious reasons but the one main one that bugs me is the fact that I am an average sized women but I guess I have a long stride because I am constantly hunched over and kicking the bottom of the stroller when pushing it. I paid alot of money for this stroller and evidently there is no attachment to help me solve this problem. I find it hard to believe that I am the only one that would have this problem. What is my husband supposed to do? The real kicker is I called Peg Perego directly and they were no help what so ever. So now I have this ...stroller and a sore back.
2,"paying for the name, not the product!!!","i received this stroller as a gift for the one that i registered for got discontinued... well, after 2 months, i have returned it and got a graco-- sure the pattern is beautiful and the material is of a high quality-- but practicality this one doesn't have it.. the basket is tiny---- a small diaper bag will fit in there & you have to squeeze it in there... no parent tray- doesn't seem like a big deal until you walk through the mall pushing the stroller in one hand and carrying a cup in the other---big pain.. i tried ordering a parent tray through peg perego but they don't make one-- and the universal one doesn't fit-- also, the 5 point harness in the stroller itself is very useless-- i have yet to meet a toddler that wants to be soo strapped in & you can't disconnect it-- i tried.. not worth the money..."
1,DTS - Horrendous version of this album,"This is one of Santana's greatest albums so it is a true shame that it was put out in such a poor version. If you compare this DTS copy to the CD, you can see what's wrong with it - NO BASS! I have a frequency analyzer in my system and the DTS has nothing below 100Hz. How could this happen? Unbelievable. I actually prefer to listen to my cd copy and never play the DTS. A total waste of money and a true shame because it could have been great..."
1,Worst sound I've ever heard,"If you think to spent your money on this DTS, save it.If you already have it and think that it sounds good, please send me your recommendations in order that I can hear it to.It's the worst mix of the century."
1,DTS Version STINKS!!!!!,"Please notice that all the other reviews you see here are for the CD VERSION not the DTS version. The DTS version was terribly remixed. Apparently, they just took different recorded tracks from the original masters and stuck them to different speakers. If you want to hear a Santana lead guitar from the left rear sorround speaker and ambiance from the center speaker then buy it! If, like me, you wanted to hear this album (the music is great) in a sorround environment with a wider soundstage, realistic acoustics, and a ""I'm at the studio"" feel you'll be better off with the CD version and save money to boot.I wrote this as fair warning to anyone else seeing so many stars for this product when most were reviewing the CD version and not the DTS version."
5,Classic!,"Since EA refuses to make another PC version of the Madden, I will continue to play this dated version. For me it still holds up! This is the third one I've purchased because I wear the game out from playing so much. I'll try to take better care of this one.What I also like about my purchase were the Tiger Woods golf and the other games that were included."
3,Acceptable for a football fan,"Whether you find the game worthy of the money spent (cheap nowadays) and the hard disk space used depends on your purpose and your priorities. If you are looking for a remarkable, life-changing game experience, then you may want to look elsewhere. The Playstation version or the Xbox versions of Madden 09 may have more of what you are looking for. If, however, you are like me, you don't have a console system, and you are wanting an outlet for your football fantasies, you might find the PC edition of Madden 08 perfectly suitable, just as I have. I'm not fussy - I just wanted to have a means to play some football, and for that this works fine."
2,The new price is too much!,"I love this moonstone and have bought two...one for me and one for my sister. However, when I bought this for my sister it was $40 dollars and when I bought it for myself it was $60! This was in the span of a month that it increased by $20??? I can see if you sold it with the chain but there is no chain. Why the price increase??? I have bought moonstone pendants larger than this for $35 dollars. The price is ridiculous! It would be one thing if it was gold but it's silver. I am not pleased with the price of this and see no reason for the increase in price. It is a nice piece but not worth $60 dollars."
1,Terrible mirror,"I purchased this mirror for my wife for makeup application, but she said it was like doing her makeup in the dark. It was way, way, way too dim to be of any use. We returned it the next day."
2,Battery Powered is not Good,"Just ordered this mirror for my wife for Christmas. Have had it for 2 days and gone through 2 sets of batteries already. I apparently did not read the description close enough because I thought it came with a power adapter, which it did not. My wife tells me that the light is not very bright and due to all of the other complaints regarding the bulb going out, this is being returned."
1,Not so great,"It's tiny, it falls over, the battery dies almost instantly so using the light is basically out, and it squeaks when I turn it around to use the magnified side!"
2,Disappointing,"The light on this mirror is worthless. Besides not being enough light, it completely stopped working after a few days- not sure if it was the bulb or the battery, it didn't matter because the light was worthless anyway. It does have a very good weight which I liked."
2,Just a pretty mirror,The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty. I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer.
1,poor light...,I purchased this item and immediately returned it. The lighting on this is extremely poor and I just thought it would be slightly taller. This item was not a keeper for me.
1,not recommended,As soon as i figure out how to return items.....this one will be. I've never had to return something i ordered from Amazon before. I was disappointed to find out it is battery operated and i only got 1 full use out of it before the batteries died. Delicately would not recommend.
3,Great Mirror,"the 5x is not as good as i thought, will probably order another one but find a 10x. Still a good mirror just not what i wanted"
1,You should just get a straw and blow bubbles!,"Stinko! I ignored the noise the first night I used it because it was very relaxing. Unfortunatly, by the second night the machine only worked for five minutes. I tried charging it as the instuction said and the next night it worked for about ten seconds. I do not recomend this at all."
1,Extortion City,"Die-hard Sex and the City fans should be too sophisticated to succumb to this ridiculous price point for what cannot even be defined as a full season. I, like many of the viewers who have posted their own comments, am a completist, but rather than round out my collection of the previous four seasons with this so-called fifth one, due to the unfortunate manner in which HBO is trying to commit highway (or should I say Fifth Avenue) robbery here I am furious enough to consider auctioning off what DVDs I've already purchased. HBO should be ashamed. This really brings new meaning to the phrase (Home) Box Office Poision!"
2,The worse season so far,"This season is not only short (8 episodes) but also it is quite boring. I love Sarah's character, but in this season is much exaggerated than ever, it seems very desperate, not cool at all, and lacking of the sense of enjoying her life. No wonder why is she single?. Any way if you have seen the previous 4 seasons you have to buy it anyway, but keep in mind that it is not close to be as good as the other ones"
3,Less Sex and Less City,"If you like the show then you'll appreciate this set. The episodes are still good in the 5th Season. The problem is that there are ONLY 8 episodes. So you are paying the same price for half the quanity. Even if you think the quality is still there it's not worth the price considering what else you can get. Lower the price to $20 or less and then I'd give it 5 stars.For fans it's a must have...for a casual viewer start with season 1-4. If you still love the show, then Seasons 5-6 are must buys. Just try to forget how much each episode costs."
2,5th Season,"If the 5th season was any good, then the cost would not matter. This show (seasons 1-4,6) always made me feel better, especially when having relationship confusion. But this season was depressing every week. I would avoid it."
1,Manolos are better priced!,"I'm a fan of this series, and I have the DVDs of all previous seaons. Yet I cannot fathom why Season 5, with so few episodes, is priced as much as the longer seasons. And I thought the price of Manolo Blahniks was inflated...."
3,"Not the best, but not as bad as everyone says.","Okay, I don't know what everyone else is talking about, but season 5 really isn't that horrible. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it, but its worth buying it used for like 10-18 bucks."
3,8 episodes same price as 24,"Ok, the folks at HBO publishing are getting greedy. Season 5 was only 8 episodes. So in HBO's infinite wisdom they decided to charge us fans the same list price as a 24-episode season, with no extras worth mentioning. (However they do split it up onto 2 DVD's to make you think you're getting more for your money.)While the shows are great I have to ding this season with 3 stars because of the blatant disregard for loyal consumers.In season 5 we have Carrie being free and single, Miranda dealing with the baby and Steve, Samantha dealing with Richard, and Charlotte in life after Trey.If you're a junky/collector I guess you'll end up purchasing it like me, otherwise send a message to HBO and just rent it."
4,A bad season of SATC is better than ANYTHING on Broadcast TV,"C'mon, fans, even Sex and the City's least worthwhile season is better than ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you'll see on broadcast TV. Season Five has it's high points, though... Carrie's photo shoot for the book cover is classic and the appearances by Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon, though a little forced, are still fun. Sure, it had it's low points...the trip to San Francisco...but again, even though it's nowhere near the ""dramedy"" brilliance of Season Three, and even though everyone's right to be a little p-o'd about the cost, I AM DREADING THE END OF THIS SPECTACULAR SHOW and will be thrilled to have this in my DVD collection."
2,I cancelled my order,"I cancelled my order after reading these reviews. I agree that the price should be lower if it is only 8 episodes. I didn't really realize that this was the case , until I read the reviews. I'll wait for the entire season 6 to become available."
1,Too much money for so little!,"I am a HUGE fan of Sex and the City... I own the first four seasons and watch them all the time! But when I found out the the fifth season only had 8 episodes and cost the same amount as all the others... I was shocked! There is no way I would ever pay that much for such a small amount of episodes. I'm patiently waiting for the price to go down to at least [$] if it doesn't get lowered, I won't buy it, which makes me so sad. :( But I still love the show!!! :)"
5,Get over it already!!!!,"Okay. We get it. The fifth season was short, but it was GREAT too. Even at this price it's so worth it to be able to pop in the DVD anytime you want and watch these hilarious girls take New York by storm. Just thinking of some of the highlights of the fifth season, I bust out laughing- from Miranda's belly button fiasco, to finally meeting Steve's ""mah"", having Molly Shannon and Amy Sedaris guest as Carrie's book publishers. This season also had great epsodes, like the introduction of Harry, Charlotte's divorce laywer and the best season finale ever, ""I Love a Charade."" Season five may have been short on episodes, but it was long on laughs, and really if Carrie can drop $400 on a pair of Manolo Blahniks, I think you can spend $40 on this....so stop complaining and just buy it already, you won't be dissapointed!! :)"
4,Am I mistaken? Less sex in the city?,"I'm really behind the ball here only half way through the season before the last. The tone is different. One (Samantha) is easing out of the only monogamous relationship she ever had. One (Charlotte) is waiting for Mr. Right to knock on her door after marrying Mr. Wrong. One (Miranda) is a little chubby (oh my god) from having a baby & is just too tired & not in the mood. Carrie has decided she doesn""t need men. Either they are getting older, which they are or they've gone through the entire male population of Manhattan.This show may be one of the best things ever on cable (The Sopranos excepted) but their shtick is wearing thin & is less creditable. We have four still gorgeous women galloping towards middle age, still relationship-phobic. Six years is probably enough."
4,It's good!,"I didn't give this season a 5 because of its shortness. I wasn't expecting much since most the reviewers did not enjoy this season as much as other ones. However, I managed to laugh and aww through all eight episode even though I didn't plan to. Granted, this was a recovery (or rebuilding) season: Carrie's breakup, Miranda's pregnancy, Sam's 'love', and Charlotte's separation/divorce. To me, this season was realistic and deep, a transition phase that you have to appreciate. The characters grew, and as a viewer I felt like I was right there with them. (...) If you're looking for lots of sex scenes and multiple partners, then this isn't the season for you. But if you love the four girls and want to keep following their lives, this isn't something you want to miss."
4,"Good, but shouldn't be this expensive","I love sex in the city, but I am dissappointed that there were only 8 episodes for this season and it was still full price."
1,The price is not right!,"I love this show. I will own this season because I eventually want the complete set. But this season is way overpriced for the number of episodes and that makes it deserve this rating of 1 star! Since the season was short (September 11, Sarah Jessica Parker pregnancy etc), I agree with others it would have been more cost-effective to release Season 5 along with the Season 6 set in one package."
2,Good but...,"Still as good as always, but I just can't believe there are only 2 discs!!! Very short season... not sure if it's worth the money... really disappointed!"
4,"Short, But Sweet","The 5th Season of Sex and the City has a lot of really great story lines and works around the pregnancies of two of the actresses quite well, but the season is sadly only 8 episodes long, which kind of leaves you wondering why you had to pay so much for a season that was so very short! However, the character development was fabulous, especially with Cynthia Nixon's portrayal of Miranda as a new mother. I laughed, I felt sympathy, my jaw dropped in shock and occasional horror, and I feel that despite its brevity, Season 5 is just as good as the rest of them."
1,Shame on HBO,In shopping around and doing some price comparisons the average cost of this DVD is $32 - $41. How dare HBO charge the consumer the identical price of seasons 1-4. The DVD only contains 8 lousy episodes. I refuse to pay full price for half the product. It's cases like this that I say the He** with the industry crying over piracy. First they sat around doing NOTHING to be proactive about stopping piracy before it got out of control as it did. Then instead of looking at their own inactions they started to sue teenagers as a fright tactic. This DVD represents the reason why people were stealing the product. They've been raping both the consumer and artist for many years now with insanely inflated prices and pennies on the dollar for the artist. I say they got exactly what they deserved no sympathy here. Greed can be very ugly indeed.
1,"My, what a pity!!!","Sort of like the old joke quoted by Woody Allen, such an awful season, and so little of it! Can't believe they have the nerve to charge full price. And just as bad breaking up Season 6. I have the first four, but that's where I get off. If we let them rip us off, they'll just continue to do it."
2,For Diehards Only,"The fifth season DVD collection is a lot like sex in the fifth year of marriage...You're only getting half what you used to for the same amount of money, and what you're getting is pretty uninspired.The fifth season is an easily skipped set. This collection is really only for the diehard fans that must have the entire series complete in their collections (which unfortunately includes me). Don't waste your money otherwise."
3,For older child - not durable,"I bought this for my 3.5 year old. The money and credit card are made of paper and coins are thin plastic, so he will tear that up in a day. I've decided to save it until he is older. I guess it is okay for the price, but overall seems a little flimsey. Does match the cash register by Learning Resources."
3,Colonial Houses,"The book is full of good ideas. However, it tends to focus in some sections on homes that are beyond the means of most --- 3,500 sq feet."
1,Compatibility Issues!!!,"I ordered the Kindle version only to find out it's NOT compatible with Windows 8. Seeing as how I have the Kindle app on my Windows 8 PC and an older Kindle, the book was useless. Thankfully, Amazon did refund my money but I see they have yet to put a notification, side note, etc, saying it cannot be opened on a computer with Windows 8. Really is a huge disappointment considering I was trying to do as many books as possible this semester as ebooks!"
2,Ho-Hum...ZZZzzzzzzz,"For me, restoring the songs to their original length turned out to be problematic in the case of ""Live at the It Club"". QUESTION: What if the restored material (largely the bass and drum solos) turned out to be uninspired and mediocre? ANSWER: You now have two CD-lengths of mediocre bass and drum solos...Furthermore, I feel that both Rouse and Monk weren't really 'on' those nights, either: Rouse's solos were often interrupted by Monk's intrusions, and Monk's solos sounded unusually mechanical and derivative. Considering that there are more inventive versions in the Monk recording catalog, the LIVE/IT CLUB collection IMHO is comparatively bland and redundant."
5,One of the best,"I bought the first Santana and Abraxis albums back in the early 1970s and although I was aware of the third album, I never picked up on it. Here all this time later, hearing all of it in its entirety, I rank it one of the best of all his albums. This album sounds more like a jam, there's a lot of energy. It's not entirely different from the earlier albums but more loose and with wonderful guitar solos and interesting percussion. It is a classic album: a little dated-sounding but I love listening to it."
1,Do not buy this book.,"This book has numerous addition and multiplication errors aswell as grammatical ones. I counted more than twenty in the first 100pages, then I stopped counting. There were even several concepts that were incorrect. I would be ashamed to put my name on this book. Buy one endorsed by the National Society of Professional Engineers."
1,Shocked,"I'm shocked that other parents have not commented about the pre-programmed caller, ""Aunt Gladys.""""Aunt Gladys"" asks your child if they want to come over and see her dogs' new puppies. That question immediately made me feel uncomfortable. It's a common ploy among child predators to ask a child if they would like to see puppies.Maybe I sound overly cautious, but I don't want my small child learning that it's appropriate for a stranger to ask them to look at puppies. (I know they say she's an Aunt, but we don't have an Aunt Gladys, so it's a stranger to her!)I hope my feedback helps you to make an informed decision."
4,Play phone a big hit,"Four year old male loves to ""call"" family members who are in the room to have brief conversations. He loves to hear parents' voice when calling his own number. It gets a lot of use. Toy is very durable. Most children who play with this toy are unconcerned that it does not exactly resemble the real thing. Amazon featured the best price and free shipping, so it was a winning deal."
5,An excellent choice that never goes out of style,"I have been listening to Johnny Mathis for 15 years now and continue to find his music exciting and comforting. His voice is unique and distintive on a par with the likes of Sarah Vanguah or Ella Fitzgerald. As a teacher of the English language, I like Johnny's phrasing and enunciation-impeccably clear and easy to understand. Johnny's personal life also mirrors his singing-refine and classy. This is a collection that will be with you all your life and that you will grow to appreciate and be comforted by each time you listen to it."
5,Great alternative to the Tivoli,"We have a classical FM station in our area and I wanted a good FM stereo radio to receive it. I wanted the Tivoli AM/FM model that looks like this Emerson, but was turned off by the $200 price in one of the electronics catalogues. Anyway, after searching the net high and low for an alternative (no boomboxes) for about two weeks, I ran into this little jewel for only $30! Couldn't believe it! Happy, happy, joy, joy. I had to preorder, but it came right through as soon as Target received the shipment."
5,Great sound for small price,"Tried this out in Target before buying and could not believe the great sound that came out of it. I was even more pleased when I brought it home and set up the antenna and strategically placed the speaker and unit. This radio has a huge, rich sound and is giving good reception even in a poor reception area. The low price tag is appreciated as well. Is also nice to have the versatility of putting the units anywhere because of the small size. A real winner!"
2,Not worth it as a radio,What is the point of having something that is simply annoying? The FM reception is awful. Hard to tune; lots of static on anything but the very strongest stations. Save your $ and buy a Sangean or Tivoli.
2,Emerson Simplicity High Fidelity AM/FM Table Radio Review,"Disappointed.""On"" and ""stereo"" lights remain illuminated -- even when radio is turned off.AM and FM signals are comingled (you receive both signals at the same time) until you ""fiddle"" with the select button several times.Sound quality quite good considering the price."
5,Great compilation,"Some of the tunes are not my style but I am a big supporter of Bocelli so I am happy to hear any of his work. I am a professional musician and, from where I stand, he is an excellent artist on all levels."
3,Review of Independent Action,"Sort of like reading The Perils of Pauline, with all the constant changes of fortune. I'd say a bit too long and detailed on the prison ship Jersey and the juvenile banter between the young Midshipmen was getting tedious. The end of book reunion between two lovers who hardly knew each other left me with a sour taste."
4,Ambition Can Be A Dangerous Thing!,"For Bette Davis fans, this story is special since she plays the part of an established Hollywood actress. Ever so slowly but surely, Margo's young fan carefully works her way into the inner circle of the seasoned actress. As Margo takes on Eve as her protege', Eve's hidden agenda becomes more and more apparent..."
5,A Tour de Force On All Counts,"""All About Eve"" is a fascinating look behind the scenes of what it can take(and sometimes what it can do) to people who live inside show business. While it's about Broadway on the surface, it's also a film about Hollywood and what it takes to be the best in the business (And what happens when youth fades and it's time to move over). The cast is super and the dialogue! Of course,people don't really talk like that(if they ever did)but wouldn't it be fun if we could all be so clever? Davis shines a Margo Channing,the 40ish diva who's about to be stabbed in the back by the poor innocent(read wolf in sheep's clothing)she takes in and trusts. This is a must have DVD,not only because the transfer makes it sparkle,but because...well...it's a damn good movie!"
5,Bette Davis' Best Performance,"Although this is not my favorite Bette Davis film, this is her best performance by far. Considering the legend of Bette Davis, that's like saying ""this is the best Picasso ever did"".If that wasn't incentive enough, look for a cameo by a major legend in the making in the middle of the film."
5,everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her heels,"I have always been a fan of this film. I had a DVD copy already, but opted to buy this for its special features. There is not one wasted line of dialogue in this exercise in backstabbing. For those who are ardent admirers, I also suggest the book ""All About 'All About Eve'."" Two of the films supporting stars, the snide Thelma Ritter and the sarcastic George Sanders (who won an Oscar for his role) are superb. This is not to say that the others are not, Davis, Merrill, Marlowe, Holm all deliver their lines as if they were born to play those roles. I could go on about this film, but I'd be at the keyboard all day."
5,GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS,"It is true that woman don't like to admit that they're more tricky and vicious when it comes to make decisions that will affect their lives or the ones that surround them, ALL ABOUT EVE is clear example of the machine brain that women posses. The story of pitchy keen girl who wants to fool everyone with a naive spirit to gets what she wants is just marvelous. For God sake she even fooled the great Bette Davis at the beginning. Talking about the late B. Davis she's so great in this movie, watching her acting you can understand why today there are some people that just don't act, they just pose. This is a great example of how anyone will make anything to get to her goal."
2,Not Bette's finest moment,"I think I may be too young to appreciate the fuss that has been made about this film. What is the big deal about a movie focussing on a bunch of bitching women? Sure it has Bette Davis in it, and yes she was nominated for an Oscar at the time ... but it is not her finest moment at all.A simple storyline about a jealous fan who manipulates anyone who gets in her way. There, I've told you ... now just go see Bette in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"""
4,Some of Santana's Best Music,"These Recordings are worth every penny spent, very well done. His music ranges from the early 60's to today and make for excellent party music."
4,Good Rating,The CD is fun and enjoyable to listen to. Most of his songs are pretty good if you understand them.
5,Best of Santana Compilation,"I bought the compilation for""No One to Depend On"" snd found every cut worth while. The drumming is awesome and Greg Rolle(later of Journey) is great on the early tracks keyboards. This is the best of an iconic classic rock artist."
2,I laughed myself silly...,"When I saw this CD in the store, I felt compelled to buy it based on the lack of Santana in my collection plus the fact that this has more songs than their original greatest hits. What a mistake! Yes, this CD has great selections from their early years, but once you hit the late 70s and into the 80s, it's a train wreck of cheesy guitar riffs and pop lyrics. Most of those songs, such as ""Open Invitation"", sound as if they should be on the soundtrack to the movie Heavy Metal... And what's with the absence of ""Everything's Coming Our Way""?"
3,Good first half-- poor second half,"The first half of this album is great, but I have to agree with another reviewer in the fact that the 70s and 80s tracks are pretty weak."
4,One Woman's Story,"I also felt compelled to keep reading this story till I reached the end.And then I too would have liked more. To this end I tried Googling this & that but sadly got nowhere that met my wish.I am left with some questions, but can really recommend the book as a good straightforward read regarding a person searching for her roots.Not knowing the bigger story, there is much I don't know. But I am wondering if Yvette might consider building in some way(s) on the undoubted merits & appeal of this book."
1,Not Ruff enough,"I purchased a frisbee for my boxer. The words on the package, that it was resistant to punctures was what sold me on it. Sad to say, 30 mins after getting the frisbee home, my dog already had a significant enough hole in it that we had to stop playing with it so he didn't choke on the pieces that were hanging off."
5,DEFINITELY A MUST FOR FUSION BUFFS,"THIS IS A GREAT COMPILATION OF STYLINGS FROM GEORGE DUKE DURING A FRESH STAGE OF HIS CAREER, WHICH BEGAN FORM SOME EUROPEAN STUDIO TIME GIVEN FROM HIS DAYS WITH FRANK ZAPPA & MOTHERS OF INVENTIONS. GREAT ARRANGEMENTS OF FUNK/JAZZ/FUSION. ALONG WITH SOME OF GEORGES BEST SYNTHESIZER SOLOS MIXED WITH ALL I CAN SAY IS.... INTENSE!! ENJOY!!"
2,Almost Forever,After reading the first twenty pages I quit. Very Very Boring. The story line was just to slow. More romance than mystery.
2,So-so book,This book is not up to her better mystery novel standards. I like her mystery novels much better than the romance novels she has written.
4,Great romance book,One thing that I really liked about this book is the pacing of the book. There was just the right amount of time spent developing the character and having them interact before any of the stronger feelings surface. Max was definitely a very well-written hero. He is very alpha even though you hardly see him lose his cool and yet always in command of things around him. Claire is definitely a mysterious and aloof heroine on the surface. But inside they are both very loving and passionate people that find love in one another. This is a very nice romance. Wish the book was longer though :-) I did not wish the book to end quickly.
1,Absolutely Awful,"I generally love Linda Howard books, but this one was not even close. I'm not sure what book some of the reviewers read, but it wasn't the same as the one I paged thru. I found the book to be basically trite from page one all the way to the end. Everything was embelished and quite frankly the lead characters disgusted me. I'll think long and hard before I buy a Linda Howard novel again."
3,just like what it sounds like,its a book of random letters that jrr tolkien wrote to people. nuff said
3,pic quality is low,I was looking for tv content on the internet for replacement of cable and the bill. I haven't found it. this sample is lower quality video.
1,Disappointing,"This product disappointed me in two important areas: very weak vibration (which I view as the most important element in a relaxing foot treatment), and maintenance of water temperature (the unit could not maintain more than a low tepid temperature)"
2,"Weak, Loud, and Overpriced","I requested and received this foot spa as a Christmas gift a year ago. Conair makes it sound like heaven! Not even close. The heat mechanism doesn't keep the water warm, it is LOUD (I have to turn the TV up insanely loud just to hear it). Now I didn't expect it to be super quiet, but I did expect to be able to hear the TV at a normal level. After only a few uses, the jets stopped working. The vibration and bubbles are great and still work fine (vibrating and bubbling lukewarm water), but that's about it. The little ""hanger"" thing they expect you to store your pedicure attachments on is a JOKE. It kept falling off so I just threw it away after about a week of driving myself crazy with it. And because of that, I have now lost all the attachments that came with it. This unit is terribly over priced. I don't even use it anymore. I use a regular motionless foot tub (one I got from the hospital actually) and it does just as good. Save your money!"
5,"Is the best album of koinonia,after front line.","I am a great fan of koinonia ,i liked this album, because i can remember my childhood.In that time i listen the frist album frontline and jumping with emotion was the greatest to me,and today is great again.Is the best album of fusion jazz.!GOD BLESS YOU! THANKS FOR THIS WONDERFUL ALBUM."
2,Disappointed,"After reading reviews about this set I ordered it. My hair is normally really hard to curl and theses did not do a thing to change that. On the bright side they did heat up really fast and they are extremely easy to wrap around your hair and secure. The cover for the curlers was broken when I got it but that was most likely a shipping problem. Other than that its a really great product, just not for my hair."
2,Not for Thick Hair,"I have thick, somewhat coarse hair. This means it doesn't typically want to curl, but once it does, it stays all day.These rollers did not curl my hair much at all. The ion curlers from Conair worked better for me."
2,Too hot!,"While these rollers do heat up quickly, I found them to be too hot to use. I was tired of burning my fingers with the rollers (and my head with the metal clips), so I got rid of my set after using it only 2 or 3 times."
3,Too curly for my hair.,"I like the concept but I wish the rollers were half as many and Bigger, Bigger, Bigger"
3,curlers are great clips are awful,"The curlers did a great job as far as giving body to my hair. The problem is the clips. They do not keep the curlers in, they kept falling out of my hair. I ended up using hair clips that I have that open really wide and that seems to work. Conair you need to develop a better system."
4,Large curls but hard to remove and replace curlers,"This set warms up fast and produces wonderful full curls. The downside is the center four curlers are hard to remove and replace with one hand. It is recommended to remove a curler before trying to hold hair and then extract the curler. I may have a somewhat defective model since no mention of this can be found in any other review. It is more of an annoyance that anything else, but I felt it deserved mentioning."
4,use them everyday,"I love these rollers, I would have rated them a 5 if not for the metal clips. So I ordered some plastic clips and thats that. I have very thin hair from the medication I take for diabeties so my hair falls out and its thining, I have tried every thing and these rollers make my short hair look full and healthy. Its quick and easy to use and Im so glad I have them. China from Fla."
2,Not a good design,"The flocked surface is nice, but the design overall is not good. The clips are too short to hold rollers in place. Back in the day, such u-shaped clips were about an inch longer, and I never had a problem before with the rollers falling out. Not true now. Also, the clips are color-coded at the tip to match the size of the roller, but the colors are so close, it's hard to get the right one. The grove in the roller to hold the roller on the heating element makes it difficult to get the clip over the roller: the clip gets stuck in the grove. The heating elements are bars that go the length of the case, and when reaching to get another roller, it is easy to touch the heating element, which can be uncomfortable. There is no tray to hold the clips between uses. Overall a bad design: if the rollers won't stay in place, they don't work. Returned them."
1,These things stink--literally!,"Plugged 'em in, the place filled up with noxious fumes and smoke that I could taste for hours. Tried again, same thing. And again. Sent 'em back."
3,"good rollers, bad clips","These foam covered rollers give lots of shine and a softer curl than rigid plastic rollers. The 4 jumbo size are nice for longer hair, but there must have been a severe metal shortage when they designed the clips. It takes several tries to get the roller to stay in. If the clips were even 3/4 inch longer, they could grab enough hair to hold on, but these are frustrating. I'm looking for another option so I can use my nice rollers!"
2,Not Great! Sent back!,"I was looking for a large roller set for body and volume and thought this would be good after reading many of the reviews. After using it a couple times, it did not work for me and I returned itPros: Large roller sizes: The super jumber rollers (1.75"") were too big for me but great from someone who has longer hair.I did like the 1.5"" rollers.Heats up quicklyPerfect number of rollers not too big not too small great for small storage spacesCons:Pins to hold in place: One of the worst things about it. No matter what way I put the pins in or how many I used I couldn't get it to stay! The rollers are big which makes them heavy and the pins provide a horrible hold at best.Burned my fingers on both the rollers AND when I was picking up a roller on the slats they sit on. This has NEVER happened to me with the traditional rollers that sit on pegs. How are you supposed to use them if the rollers themselves get so hot?I sent it back and am searching for something similar with more pros."
3,Hard to work with,"I tried these rollers for the first time yesterday and was really disappointed in the instructions and handling the rollers. I would have to wear gloves to use the rollers if I do not want to burn my fingers. When I finally got the rollers in the hair the next problem were the clips. There are no instructions how to attach the clips to the rollers. Up, down, sideways....nothing. After minutes of trying different ways I finally got the mission accomplished but felt very disappointed. The one good thing that comes out of using these rollers was actually nice non frizzy hair with very gentle curls. For the first time in months my hair looked great, it was just very difficult getting there :-("
1,Not as described,"I purchased this set after reading many reviews on many different products. I'm disappointed these came with the old fashioned wire clips instead of the newer claw type clips shown in the product image! I did not get what was described. This makes using the curlers much harder for me, the wire clips leave a mark in my hair. The rollers do heat up quickly and work well IF the correct clips were included I'd be very happy!"
3,"rollers good size, pins don't hold in place.","The size of the rollers are great. They heat up quickly, but the pins are almost impossible to stay in place. Haven't been able to get full use of them because of the pins...."
2,Not hot enough,"These curlers do not get hot enough. The pins work just fine, but they do not get hot enough to make a lasting curl that is worth the effort or the money spent. The size of the curlers are awesome if they did get hot enough, I've even tried using less hair in each section even though I have thin hair to begin with. I would go with a different product."
4,Nice item,"I like these rollers, but i would love them if they included 3-4 more rollers because 12 is not enough to do all my hair. the clips arent that bad at least with my type of hair (not too thin) if they didnt hold the first time, i moved the clips every way possible until they got a good hold. In the future i will buy other clips. The rollers get pretty hot but they ARE called Heat Rollers so you just have to be careful and they leave a nice big curl."
2,Conair Extreme Heat rollers a disappointment,"I ordered this product for myself as a Christmas present. I have long hair and when I straighten it, there is not much body. I hoped these heated rollers would do the trick. Unfortunately, the rollers will not stay in. I would secure one and when reaching for the next one, the first one would fall out. Sometimes I could get as many as three in if I was careful with my movements. The strands of hair I was able to get around the rollers did look good and had the body I wanted. However, the rollers are so difficult to use, I finally gave up on them. They were a total waste of money."
2,Really doesn't do much,These hot rollers don't do anything. There are no curls in my hair. I have long layered hair and the rollers won't stay in. When I take them out there isn't even any body. Don't waste your money.
2,"Makes nice curls, but....","You need two hands to turn it on or off, one to hold the case and one to move the switch. The switch ""on"" position is to the left, kind of odd for a product sold in the U.S. The clips are horrible, horrible, horrible."
2,Just Stopped Working,"I used this product to keep my microbraids looking great. It worked well for a year, and then just stopped working.... it no longer heats up. I called Conair and the product is past the warranty period, so I am SOL. I don't want to have to replace the whole product every year. I'll have to find another brand."
2,Can't wait to get a different set!,"Every time I use these hot rollers, I swear I will never use them again, and promise myself I am going to buy a new set immediately!! The clips are my biggest complaint. They simply do NOT hold the curlers properly! Grrrr.... I end up using two clips on certain areas of my head."
3,Conair Instant Heat CHV14J review,"The smart clips that came with these rollers are not in the least bit user friendly. I found them impossible to use. The rollers themselves do heat up very quickly, but they get too hot. I tried to use the smart clips and the new rollers for a week but then gave up. I returned to my very old Conair Travel set of 5 Jumbo rollers with my old fashioned metal clips. My new rollers have disappeared into the cabinet underneath my wash basin!"
3,Too Darned Hot,"I was excited to have only JUMBO rollers to us for styling and more than only 6 of them.This set MEANS well but the rollers are so incredibly HOT to the touch (of both fingers and scalp) that they heat up the clips to the point of singeing hair and skin.I would have preferred a temperature controlled version of this product and am sorry that I gave my sister my previous multi-sized roller set that DID have temp control.Also, these clips SUCK. They leave horrible indentations....would have been great to have been given the larger, claw type of clips that would accommodate the larger sized rollers sans the metal that becomes very uncomfortable to sport for longer than 30 seconds.I'd return this but I'm too busy and I've used it......buyer beware of HEAT."
3,Just OK,These heat up pretty quickly and are a good size but the clips are tragic. They are hard to use and leave weird wrinkles in your hair. Considering either buying different types of clips or just returning the whole thing.
3,Worth the results?,"Having had short hair for a long time, I'm new to the hot roller world. The good news is that that these rollers create nice strong bouncy curls and waves. The bad news is that they're a pain to keep in. Are all hot rollers this heavy? Anticipating problems based on reading some of the reviews, I ordered special clips. Conair Super Clips, Hold Hot And Cold Rollers 10 PackThese help some--you have to maneuver the clips under the roller so that one edge of the clip clings to hair next to your scalp. Otherwise, these rollers just don't stay in. I finally got a super jumbo shower cap and put in on over the whole mess. I'd give these a 4 for the nice curls, but a 1-2 for convenience. If you don't want to go through what I did, try another brand."
1,"WISH I Liked, BUT DIDN'T","I was sooo excited to get these because it seemed to have lots of jumbo rollers (more than most sets), but for some reason it didn't work on my hair. It wouldn't hold the curl no matter how long I let the set heat up. I even bought the clips that people recommended w/ this set, but still it didn't work well. I have another set that has clips that heat up w/ the rollers and that type of set seems to hold the curl for most of the day, but I just wished it had as many jumbo rollers as this one."
2,Not Impressed,"I was hoping the rollers would be bigger. I have long, really thick hair & the rollers are not big enough & there are not enough of them to do a good job. The clips are usless for holding the roller tight. I returned it the next day!"
1,You Get What you Pay For,"I read the text associated with this (no illustrations, index, etc.). It stated that it pertained to the Paperback edition. So, I purchased the Hardcover edition, which was not as expensive as other editions.It pertains to both the paperback and hardcover editions.The text is clean and readable. However, many people (most I might speculate), will purchase this book for the illustrations as well as the text. The illustration pages not only come out black, you cannot make them out at all.If you want the text only, buy the paperback. If you want to see illustrations and purchase a hardcover copy to keep, look elsewhere."
4,A classical book upon India Army,"This is a 2005 re-edition of the 1911 MacMunn & Lovett work. Edited in Pakistan, it is a good work, keeping its original fonts. The illustrations are good and the printing is quite good."
2,Self published?,Thanks for the tip about this being self published through Iuniverse as that make more sense about the quality. An editor with a good eye is needed. A taleneted playright is needed even more.
1,Don't buy it!,"This is a horrible product. I bought it for my mom for Christmas and the coffee did not brew hot nor did it stay even lukewarm in the carafe for more than about half an hour. When we contacted the manufacturer about their false advertising and touts of a product that could keep coffee hot for 6 hours, they maintained that this was true and would not accept our complaint. Since then, my mother has purchased the Mr. Coffee model and has been much happier with its performance."
5,If you love Harry....you will love this sticker book!,"I purchased this sticker book and absolutely love it. Great stickers that show the characters in the Harry Potter Book series in great detail. The stickers bring them alive. Would recommend for any ""Potter Fan""..."
3,FingerSmith,"Fingersmith is Victorian street slang for pickpocket, and in this story, it's not just purses that are being purloined. The double entendre of the title is but a hint of the trickery that Waters has up her sleeve. Just when you think you know what's going on, and who can be trusted, the author deftly pulls the rug out from underneath you. And, like the characters in the book, you'll be scrambling to keep your wits. From the first sentence, you'll be immersed in a Victorian whirlpool that would make Dickens envious. This compelling page-turner is replete with pickpockets and thieves, anonymous pornographers, changelings, rat infested slums, sequestered country manors, madhouses, public hangings, daring escapes, deception, stolen identity and seduction.This book is not really my type because I like scary books but It is a really good book"
5,Awesome!,This is an incredible book. She takes you through so many twist and turns that it is impossible to put the book down. Wonderful writer!
2,"Good enough to finish, but","I wish Part 1 had just continued to a logical conclusion. In my opinion, nutty plot-twists don't equal creative writing."
4,great plot twists,"well...this book was wonderfully atmospheric (or maybe i'm just partial to mid-1800s london). it is divided into three parts, and i most enjoyed the first, and its narrator, sue. although the plot became a little convoluted and often dragged, the writing more than made up for the deficiencies."
4,Full Of Twist and Turns....,"I think my head is still spinning. But wow!! What a book! I was intrigued from the first chapter and it just got better and better. Every time I thought I had a character figured out, something happened and I was proven wrong. This is a beautifully written story filled with mystery, love and betrayl.I loved every minute of it."
1,Terrible,"I enjoyed Sarah Waters other books very much and thought they were well-written, clever, compelling stories. This book is not only disappointing by comparison but it is hopelessly trite, silly, preposterous and boring by any measure. It is hard to imagine that such a gifted author would turn out something like this. Some friend or editor should have saved her from this embarrassment."
3,"Fun, but a Booker nominee?","Fingersmith follows two orphan girls in Victorian England through the twists and turns of a complex fight to possess inheritance money. The novel is an entertaining trip through the seamy underside of 19th century English life, but how is became a Booker nominee is beyond me --- it must have been a thin year for Commonwealth literature. The novel is completely plot-driven, with characters who achieve two dimensions but do not approach three. The definition of great literature is a matter of opinion. Mine is that it should say something about the world as it truly is, about what it means to be human. Fingersmith is a fun read but not illuminating and ultimately shallow."
3,Had great potential.....,"I run a book discussion group that is comprised of mostly older women in their 70s and 80s. I chose this book because it was on a top 10 book club list that I read somewhere on the internet and the story takes place during the victorian era which I thought the women would enjoy. You can read the reviews from some of the other readers to get a sense of what the story is about...I will just leave it that when I asked the women if they would recommend it to a family member or friend they all resoundingly said NO!! The story provided a lively discussion, however, and it became obvious that we all got confused at times with keeping up with the curves and twists in the plotting of the story. (They did not seem to mind the minor lesbian subtext either)."
1,Tedious and Dragging,"Just because a book is by Sarah Waters (and she usually writes with more literary sense than many other lesbian authors) does not make it good literature, or even a good story.I was so happy to find this book - imagine a lesbian plot line with more than a short afternoon's read! By the end, I was so disappointed.Yes, there are many twists to the plot, but I'm sorry that I wasted my time plodding through to the end. If you want a good ""miserable-read"" with a bit more action, try the Lemony Snickett's series in the Young Adult section"
3,Fingersmith Fizzles,"This novel started out gangbusters and kept me turning pages with unexpected plot twists and turns during the first two thirds of the book. I thought the characters were well developed, if slightly unbelievable, and the plot innovative. I really loved the story until....in my opinion,the plot deteriorates into a predictable and slightly depressing mess. I don't want to be a spoiler but I could see the conclusion a mile before it happened. I did finish the book and did not feel it was a waste of time as I enjoyed the look into the Dickensian lives of both the lowest and highest classes in those times. I am not sorry I read it but I am sorry the author could not achieve the excellent quality of the first two thirds of the work in the last chapters."
3,Dickensian,"I learned of this book while reading a biography of Willkie Collins. Fans of Collins and Dickens might enjoy this unusual take on mid-10th century life from a female viewpoint. The story drags on a bit, but there are entertaining twists here and there. Of more interest to female readers than male readers, although I reject the notion that it's only for lesbians."
1,Don't sound so good.......................,"I don't know about this bird feeder. Reading these reviews it sounds like it does a great job of keeping squirrels away. However, the quality of materials and construction leaves me with the impression that this is a piece of junk.Forget about the squirrels, I'm worried about falling acorns shattering this thing to pieces.Not worthy of my money."
5,Squirrel proof,"I enjoy watching those furry pigs fall off this feeder. It sits next to one with a top baffle and both are squirrel proof. The birds are laughing, too."
1,Broke,"When i received it, I put it together and added my seed to it. I attached it to thetree branch and by the end of the day I saw that it had fallen from the tree. To my surprise, it broke in pieces.So, no I would not recommend it nor buy it again"
3,great for quick overview of the Jewish horror in Warsaw,This book is short but gives good insight to the horror that the Jews of Warsaw suffered in the years of Nazi occupation. First hand reports from diaries and interviews make this a good selection.
3,"Not bad, not essential either....","So Jerry says ""F*** it!"" and goes ahead with the solo album he's been threatening to unleash on the world since AIC went south. But with ex-bandmates Sean Kinney on drums and Mike Inez on bass on a few of the tracks (the relevant ones), this feels more like Alice In Chains sans Layne, whose particular world-view informed the band's best material. Still, this record can be enjoyed on different levels, if for no other reason than Jerry's still 'blossoming' songcraft. Memo to Jerry--reconcile with Staley, and soon!!!!"
3,Some good moments,"As the creative force behind AIC, I felt I owed it to Jerry to buy this CD sight unseen.....ahhhh, make that sound unheard. I hoped, indeed knew, that this would not be just Alice sans Layne. ""Dickeye"" is sensational, but following this with ""Cut You In"" was a big letdown. In fact, the album took me on a rollercoaster of ups and downs; there's also a couple of brief but odd Metallica and Bush segues. Don't get me wrong - there's some very good stuff here and it sounds better after a few plays - but I'm not of the opinion that Cantrell hit a home run on this project."
4,Nice piece of furniture!,"I had a phone jack on the wall where it was useless. I could have taken it out and patched the wall, but I saw this phone and decided to check it out.Well, it looks awesome. I don't actually use it as a phone although is does work. I get too many annoying calls on the land line.Unknown phone call quality, but looks great."
2,Have only owned this for 3 months and is already broken.,"We liked the looks of this phone for our kitchen. Installed the telephone, and in less than 3 months it doesn't work. The receiver arm where you hang up the telephone does not work. You do not get a dial tone when you lift up the receiver. Because this phone does not work, all of the other phones in the house, as well as our voice mail does not work. I finally had to uninstall it to make everything else work. Will not get a replacement."
2,Looks good,"Bought this phone for our newly remodeled kitchen. When we hooked it up we heard nothing through the hand set. Speaker phone had dial tone but not handset. Plugged in a hand set from one of our other old phones and it worked. Notified Crosley, they sent us a new handset, now that one works but there is loud static. Guess I'll call Crosley again and hope they send me another one that works correctly."
3,So Far,"I only got this item last evening. It seems to be good so far. There is a slight echo in the line and I know it is not the phone-line in my house because I unplugged a phone that was fine and plugged this one in. I will give this a few days at least, then give a better/worse rating depending. I IS beautiful though and nostalgic. Thank You"
1,Powerwasher,"With all the different nozzles enclosed, none fit my pressure washer. Mine just happens to be different, Made in Italy and the distributor seemed to have left the US market."
3,It catches a good amount,"for the size of the purifier and the size of the filter, if you smoke in a room it will clear 1 to 2 cigarettes smoke in about an hour...not bad"
4,A little bit too fictional,This book is a very good book to read if youlike to get the shivers but some of it is very hard to thinkabout
3,Replaced lost school library book,I purchased this book to return to my son's school library after he lost the book somewhere in his room.
4,A great bargain,"The Capresso 101.01 lives up to its promise of quick no hasstle expresso and steamed milk. Warming cycle is a bit of a bother, but not much really when considering the price and the performance of the machine. One key will be how well the coffee to steam switch on the left side stands up. Overall, a good bargain, and good expresso."
5,Nice Deal,"I bought this to replace the large, noisy air filter I was using. I am pleased with the relatively small size, easily replaceable filters, and especially the quiet running. This system is barely audible when on. It works very good within a six foot radius, even on cigarette smoke. The price cannot be beat even with shipping and handling, it's quite a bargain."
3,Mediocre - Except for Gara!,"Overall, I think Allston hasn't filled the shoes left by Stackpole. It seems that no matter how much Imperial hardware is arrayed, all the rebels have to do to defeat it is show up in an X-Wing; after a while this becomes a shop-worn cliche. The only thing that makes this book worth-while is Gara Petothel's character. Is it just me or is Allston setting her up to be Yisanne Isard's long lost sister? She is extremely smart and resourceful (like Isard, except Gara is less arrogant and has a moral compass). Both are from Coruscant. Recall that Isard had her parents executed (as did Gara). In addition, hints are continually dropped that Isard may still be alive. The potential for a family reunion (ala, Luke/Vader) is there."
3,Disappointing,"My friend got this for her birthday, and a bunch of us played it for a long time. It's pretty fun, but totally pointless. As people have said before, it just randomly says when someone is fibbing. You really can't find out who has a crush on someone, and if your best friend thinks you're stupid, etc. Also, some of my friends got mad when a question like ""Do you think I'm ugly?"" was asked, then another answered with ""No"" and the thing said she was lying. Now, I've never seen a game cause fights before - but this one did."
4,Trunk Music,I like it. I always like Connelly. His books move fast and they are entertaining. I'll read more of his books.
2,Too Coincidental,"Not one of his best! Events were often coincidental, predictable or unbelievable. Reminded me of a mystery written in the 1940's."
4,Good read,"If you are a Harry fan, you will enjoy this tale. A good story that will keep your attention. I always need more Harry."
5,A Vegas Twist,Harry Bosch is on the prowl again. It's his first case back from a suspension and it leads Harry to the seamy side of Vegas. He encounters an old flame and is caught up in a case that has enough twists and turns to keep your head spinning. Mr. Connelly's writing is crisp and his characters are well drawn. It doesn't get any better than this.
4,Connelly 1,"I have read several Michael Connelly books, and am particularly fond all of the Harry Bosch novels. I think Harry makes a great, hard boiled detective character. I started with later episodes, but found myself going back to the beginning and not being bothered by reading stories I had heard referenced in later books. The Lincoln lawyer stories are great as well, of course eventually weaving their way into the Bosch storyline. Can't wait for the next...keep up the good work Michael!"
5,Trunk Music,"GREAT BOOK!! I love that you get to know the main character along with the story. I never got bored, it kept my attention and didn't want to put it down. Loved the book."
3,"Good Characters, Good Pacing",This is one of the best Harry Bosch novels. The dark characters under suspicion here are fantastic Connelly creations and the pace is unrelenting.
3,Not one of the best but still very enjoyable,OK let me start by saying this is an enjoyable book and if you're a fan of both Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch books you will like this. Having said that I will add that the story does run a bit long and as a result it is thin towards the end. I did enjoy the fact that there were several twists and turns you didn't see coming but the end of the novel does seem a bit labored and forced.This is enjoyable reading and while it's not Bosch's best work it is still a fun and interesting book. If you're a fan of the series you will not be sorry you read it!
3,Just Another Day at the Police Park,"This is the first Connelly book I have read. I felt as though I was reading a cheap murder mystery that I could of watched on TV and saved some time. The story wasn't all that bad. There just wasn't something there that clicked with me. I am an avid reader and love a good suspense or murder mystery. So, I feel as though I can judge from cheep to a good read and this book was just in-between. I will most likely try another book by this author hopefully with better luck."
1,"Awful, formulaic with an annoying main character","Connely's Bosch is a loser. His gratuitious ranting against the IAD types, to give us a supposedly ""common enemy,"" is hackneyed; the plots always revolve around a betrayal that one can figger from page 85, once one has slogged through one of his tomes. I picked up his first with high hopes and ended it feeling suckered. In fact, all of his lead characters, far from being the ""common man"" he appears to intend, come off as annoying whiners. Arggh."
2,Not big enough,I bought these lights for my skidloader as I do alot of work near or on the highway with snow removal. They are plenty bright but you do have to drill holes in the loader to screw to the machine and they are very small which I had overlooked the size measurements when I ordered them. I would not order them again if I had looked at the size.
3,VERY GOOD.... but not great,"This movie had some really great things going for it. The leading actors were at their best even as children they had great chemistry going on between them. It was a very sexy, stylish and well put together movie for the most part. The real down fall for me was the character played by Robert De Niro. I know this movie was based on the book by Charles Dickens but really De Niro just got in the way of the flow of the story from the very start to me. They really did not need him at all in this version of Great Expectations. He kind of messed it up for me."
3,Has its moments,"Every time I think of this movie, for some reason, the beautiful score comes to mind. I can't get it out of my head, it really is addictive. As for the movie, it is certainly watchable, but lacking. The performances are all good but it felt off at times. I have never read the book, but I was told its not really anything like it. However, as a movie, its pretty decent, even good at times. I think its a tad too long though, and it seemed dragging at times. I didn't really feel anything emotionally for any of the characters, and I think that is what bothers me every time I watch this."
5,Just Absolutely Outstanding!,This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Everything is done very well. I could watch it over and over. Every actor and actress does a stupendous job. Gwyneth Paltrow captures Estella very well and Ethan Hawke is superb. Robert DeNiro rocks. Anne Bancroft is awesome in her portrayal of Mrs. Haversham. I really identified with Ethan Hawke's character Finn. I felt every emotion the character was expressing all through the movie. If you are thinking about buying this DVD...do it. This is a wonderful 5 star superb film.
3,watchable,"Worth the price of renting a video. I picked this one up strictly because I saw DeNiro was int it, and although he plays no more than a cameo, the movie kept my attention."
1,don't have great expectations for this movie...,"This movie stunk. There is no point to it. Ethan Hawke is awful... his only expressions are confused and more confused. I guess when you get too many stars up on the screen, the movie tends to lose something, eh? I'm sorry I even wasted the money to see this in the theater."
1,Stick with the classic....,"I've seen this movie and the original version done in the 1940's. I highly recommend the original version where you get the complete set of characters (including ""Aged P"") which is what makes a Dickens story."
4,So watchable,"Everytime I catch this film on Tv, no matter how far throught it is I end up watching it till its conclusion. Such a watchable film. Superbly crafted andacted. One of teh few modernisations of classic tales that actually works."
2,Pretty but incoherent.,"I'm a teenager. I've never read Dickens. So technically, I was supposed to like this movie.I didn't. What do you get when you put a bunch of pretty people in pretty settings with an incoherent story line mixed in? A bad movie.The only good thing about this whole Great Expectations project is the soundtrack. Worth getting for ""Siren"" by Tori Amos alone."
3,It's a text book,"It is a nice and easy to read text book for learning Mandarin Chinese. The dictionary in the back has a small Chinese to English part, but no English to Chinese section. A nice tool for learning on your own or with a class. It also comes with several practice books, to practice writing characters, and tapes to supplement the text."
1,DVD Purchase,I never actually got the product. I got an email from the business saying they had shipped the wrong item and they credited my Discover card. I never received anything.
3,It's About Life -,"Good story about our individual struggles and the incredible resources within ourselves to overcome adversity, if we learn how to and choose to use our inner resources. Very Zen.Fair movie. Story makes up for shortcomings in film.Somewhere between the actual novel and the movie is the perfect balance. Liked some parts in the movie better than the actual book. Character development stronger in the book. Movie did a great job in casting Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen roles.See the movie and read the book."
5,Don't Believe the Snobs,"I know that this film has been criticized harshly by a majority of so-called professional reviewers, but I would strongly recommend ignoring their snooty arrogance. This is a wonderful movie that, like fine art, can and should be enjoyed over and over again. What can I say--I love this movie. I'd watch it only for the cinematography and musical score, they are so great. But there are very nice nuanced performances here, especially Will Smith (foget the so-called politically correct comments about ignoring of race in this film)--he steals the film, and as its protagonist demonstrates that the moral high ground has no color. Watch the movie and then go out there and find your authentic swing.RockDoc"
3,It feeds us the expected Redford ingredients.,"Another great film directed by Redford, Bagger Vance is a zen-like meditation piece about a man who must overcome his own demons. Not a wonder why this film didn't really do well at the box office, it's a theme that challenges the typical Hollywood audience. As expected, Redford feeds us his trademark of emotionally rich dark tones, entwined with the beauty of nature and life, similar to his brilliant film ""A River Runs Through It."" The cinematography is a beautiful piece of work, as well as its music score, costume and production design. This is the final film the late Jack Lemmon appeared in."
3,Fun enough,"Legend of Bagger Vance (PG-13)- Fun, nostalgic, with bursts of inspiration throughout. Will Smith is far too young for this role but does what he can. Charize Theron is hilarious!"
4,A Lot More Than Just Golf,"The first thing that I have to say is that I am not a fan of golf. I don't really understand the sport and think it's boring. But the movie was not just about golf which made me enjoy it even more. The thing that made me want to see this movie were the actors. Matt Damon, who in my opinion is one of the best actors at the moment, gives a splendid performance. He is believable and really gives you a feel for his character. Will Smith gives an unexpected performance, portraying Damon's caddy, Bagger Vance. Usually when you see Will Smith he's toting a gun. But I was pleasantly surprised by his acting ability shown in this drama. He made the movie more interesting and even more fun to watch.. Robert Redford definately knows how to make a movie. The cinematogrophy is some of the best I have seen in awhile. He is a truly great director, and gives audiences a story to ponder over for a few days. Truly, one of the best dramas to come out this year."
1,not worth it,"This software was difficult to use, didn't do what it said, and I ended up having to buy another tool to do the same thing. There are others out there, keep looking."
3,"Not fantastic, but not a dog either!","Your mileage may vary, but in my experience this product is NOT the complete dog that the other reviews point to. I'm running it on a laptop with Vista Home Premium. Once I figured out that you have to have hard drive access enabled on your iPod (a setting in iTunes)it works like a charm.I successfully cloned ~3000 songs from a 30gb iPod Classic to a new 8gb iPod Nano. I like the ability to edit properties of the songs, delete duplicates, etc.The interface is only adequate, not great, and the help a little skimpy - but its only 19.95 and it does extend greater flexibility in managing single & multiple iPods."
5,darkest days,"Darkest days is one of the best cds of all time. Not only is it gothic,but it's industrial as well. Stabbing Westward is at there best if you don't already have this cd and you are a big Stabbing Westward fan you had better get it because you are missing out. My favorite song is darkest days because i'm sure anyone can relate to it."
2,Over rated nonsense.,"A student-level band given far too much exposure and hype. Nothing worthwhile here, just a disc of dull noise and juvenile lyrics. the usual gothic tedium stuck on plastic for the desperate masses of the black and velvet clad. Don't bother."
5,DARKEST DAYS TEARS DEEP INTO YOUR SOUL,"As soon as I heard my first Stabbing Westward song (What Do I Have To Do), right away they became one of my favorite bands. Although their two other albums were great, DARKEST DAYS reaches deep into your soul, and really gets to you. I think their third album is the greatest of all. In DARKEST DAYS, the poetry and music is so much stronger than before. My favorite song is Waking Up Besides You(16). Just by listening to it once, it got into me. One of things I love about this album is that it's not really happy, so to speak, but it cheers me up when I listen to it. As soon as I heard DARKEST DAYS, SW became my all-time favorite band. DARKEST DAYS became my favorite cd. I love them! I can't go a day without listening to the third album of SW."
5,"A FANTASTIC cd for the dark, hurting soul","This cd is a spectacular piece of work. All the songs are great, and especially Save Yourself, Haunting Me, and Torn Apart. It's great for those of us people who are filled with anger, and pain. With it's influential heavy, hard, loud, and stinging sounds, it shall be the bible of its genre."
1,Dead on arrival,"I got this phone purchased for me off my wishlist and it arrived to me broken! We contacted customer service multiple times and had no response. This really sucks because it is a very cute phone, but BEWARE."
5,I LOVE this phone!,"I already had this phone in my kitchen and liked it so much that I decided to get another one for my computer room. It is so feminine looking and pretty, but also works so well. The hand-piece is curved perfectly and is so comfortable to hold. Pink is my favorite color, which is another big plus, but it is as functional as it is pretty to look at."
4,Love My Princess,"I just wish it had the dial-pad backlight, like it's original prdecessor. But it's SOOOO nice to use a phone that actually has some heft and doesn't feel like it was made by Fisher-Price."
5,Great gift,Sent as gift to son-in-law serving in Iraq. He (and friends) have really enjoyed the dvd.
5,hilarious,"This is one of my all-time favorite shows. I'm a big Simpsons fan, and Groening expressed his creativity without falling victim to the ""same show with different name"" abyss. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy, but it sometimes helps (although the show is still hilarious if you're not)."
3,My Buying experience,"Well I am happy to get my futurama in the mail, although I didn't get for Christmas like Amazon said I would, but after calling customer service they told me they tried to deliver it but couldn't find my address, I had it sent to my parents house out of state, then I finally received the package 3 days later. Really I am just glad to get my package."
2,"Crass, base and yet sometimes funny","This set of cartoons are mostly sarcastic, sometimes base and vulgar, revealing, for what cartoons can reveal, and yet even funny, that is if one can get past the afronting style of the writers. I would not recommend this for children."
3,Disappointing DVD transfer,"Watching Futurama via broadcast, I was always impressed by the high sound standard which translates full and rich on MTS stereo.The Dolby Surround offered on this collection does not match in frequency response and is mixed centre-channel heavy.The picture, although sharp and clear with excellent colour balance, is unfortunately full of distracting compression artifacts on movement.5 stars for Futurama and 2 stars for the transfer.Futurama is cult and it's fans deserved better."
5,it's futurama!,"Season 1. there's not really a question. If you're an old school simpsons fan (seasons 3-8 are pure gold) then you have no reason for not enjoying futurama, which was created and written by many of the same people from that era."
1,Just NOT Funny,"I don't understand why Fox didn't cancel it sooner., it was just taking Matt Groening's time away from the Simpsons (which WAS actually funny at one time). Because of this lack of Simpsonial supervision, the show became unfunny. I blame YOU, Futurama. Anyway, this show has unlovable characters, bad jokes, and jumps around settings too much. It's just not good."
3,Good romantic comedy,"Genre: Romantic ComedyGenre Grade: B+Final Grade: BI had never seen this movie before but I watched it on Comedy Central today. It was a pretty good movie. I thought some lines in the movie were hilarious. The movie was all about playing with the cliche that only attractive women get the man...but then what romantic comedy isn't? No, it might have walked the same line as many movies before it, but it actually had strong characters and a good story. If you're like me and you've never watched this movie, I would suggest it if you enjoy these kinds of movies.Quotables:Abby: I have to tell you something.Brian: What?Abby: The other night on the phone... I'm pregnant.Brian: Oh darling...are you sure it was me?Abby: I don't know. I made a lot of phone calls that night."
2,Not as universal as expected,"I wanted to upgrade our old IKEA multi storage, but this one didn't accommodate the foil or paper towel rolls (standard sized). Also, changing out an empty roll involves some disassembly of the holding brackets, which affects the other roll not needing replacement at the same time. A great-looking product but not ergonomic at all."
2,"You CANNOT ""Tap a Tune"" on this toy","The notes are so out of tune on this xylophone that we had to get rid of it because it drove my husband and me crazy! If you just want your baby to bang out random noise, go for it. Yes, it's sturdy, and well built, but if you'd like to attempt a song in tune, buy something else."
1,out of tune,My son received this xylophone for Christmas. We are really disappointed that the notes are out of tune. No fun. We are going to sell it on Craigslist.
1,Out-of-Tune Musical Instrument,"DO NOT buy this toy if you have any sense of pitch, or if you care about whether your child develops a good musical ear. It is badly out of tune. It costs just as much to manufacture a toy with musical bars properly sized to be in-tune. Yuck!"
3,Pretty and dainty and subtle,"I loved this ankle bracelet! Unlike other ones, I barely would notice when it was there and it didn't rub against me and irritate my skin. After about 6 months though, it broke =("
4,Wife is a huge Billy Ray fan,"My wife is a huge Billy Ray fan so I got ""stuck"" watching this movie. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, Billy Ray's not going to win a oscar but is not to bad, Patricia Neal was great as his Mother. The story was good and the music even better, so all in all its a movie worth watching."
1,Not worth the time,"Very poor acting. Expected a good story, but the poor acting made it hard to believe.Don't waste your money or your time."
4,Angel Hitting Its Stride,The series takes off in the second season as the team takes form. Wesley is incorporated to a greater extent and Cordelia's visions are strengthed. Very solid season.
1,Discs malfunction: they do not play,"Always view the 1 and 2 star ratings before you read the 5. Usually we have something to tell you about the product itself and not how much we love the show/acting/plots/special effects.The Slim Disc set for Angel the Series is simply unacceptable. The product does not wholly work. Some CDs do not play, others stop playing after so many views. This is not an isolated incident, I see cases of many, many other people complaining of the same problem. Discs 2 and 4 do not play in any kind of media player I own. Computer tower, portal DVD, actual DVD player. None of these things register the disc as existing in drive.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's faulty."
1,bad luck,i ordered this originally as a gift for my son for christmas. when he finally tried to watch it there were episodes that wouldn`t play. amazon promptly replaced the set and the same problem again. amazon again replaced the set and once again some episodes would not play. at this point i returned all three and decided to give up.
2,Faulty DVDs,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter from the Gold Box. Two of the DVDs were scratched and not viewable, which I did not know until AFTER the 30 day exchange policy since I bought it early as a gift. Not such a good deal after all. I can understand return policies on products like these, but it is still very frustrating to spend money on a product that does not work, expecially when purchased in advanced as a gift and there is no indication that there is a problem."
3,love this flavor,I absolutely love this flavor of hamburger helper. I saw it in the store and only bought two boxes just incase I didn't like it. Now am sorry I didn't buy a whole case because I can not find any more in any of the stores in my town....
5,Authenticity.,"""This book will focus on the exuberant and abundant breakfast, lunch and snacks of China when she is most at ease and without formality."" pp.xviI love this book. The recipes are very authentic and gives me the, you're in China feel, she begins the book with many of the things you'd encounter were you to wake up in certain parts of China right now. Even though the book is from 1979, many of the references still hold true today.Savory sesame scallion biscuits, chung yao bing, teahouse spareribs in garlic and black bean sauce, shao mai, hah gau, backlane wonton-noodle soup, beef congee with condiments, deep-fried ghosts, lotus leaf rice, joong, fried sweet sesame balls, two faces yellow noodles shanghai style, sauces and dips, etc."
3,Depends on what you where expecting,"This book covers many aspects that are universal to all dogs (such as types of collars and food bowls). It's OK for beginers, but I wouldn't recomment it for someone who seeks a bit more breed-specific reading."
1,Disappointingly Simple,"For the cost of the book, I was expecting some more advanced concepts than examples such as how to set a table, get gas for your car, and get ready for work. This is a workbook more for students learning how to create workflow diagrams. For a working professional, it is useless. It does not deal with complex work processes."
5,it works.,"It works. I had some hematuria, that I needed to track, and it worked for this. By the way, it was from otherewise assymptomatic kidney stones, and lithotripsy fixed me."
5,A must-have for any writer's book shelf,"Karen S. Wiesner's book gives you the tools you'll need to successfully organize and outline your novel in a month. Rendered in an easy-to-read style, the author provides readers with instructions on how to finally get the book idea that's stuck in their heads OUT on paper and into a form that assists in efficiently delivering the first-draft of a manuscript quicker than they ever thought possible.Do yourself a favor: buy this book!"
3,"Next to Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks is remembered!","Rosa Parks is best remembered as the Black woman who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a White person. However, she was much more that that. She was raised by grandparents because her mother taught school in another city. Her grandfather was the child of a slave owner and a slave. Rosa was determined to make a difference for her people. She and her husband took part in supporting the Scottsboro boys, Black youth who were accused of crimes they did not commit. Rosa became secretary of the NAACP and contributed greatly to her people, eventually receiving the Congressional Gold Metal award."
4,"More memorable than ""Progress""","In my opinion, this album is much more interesting to listen to than ""Progress"". The songs are catchier and contain more melody. I'm not really a fan of this nu metal thing, but these guys are far more intelligent than more other bands they get compared to. Pete Murray has an outstanding voice as shown on tracks like ""5"", ""Wrapped"", and ""Sponge"". My advice would be not to believe anybody that compares these guys to KoRnY and Gimp Bizquick because they have nothing on these guys except downtuned guitars. The guitar riffs are simple, but are varied nicely. The bass and drums form a steady rhythm section and, as mentioned before, the vocals are amazing. Fans of more popular bands like Tool, Staind, Ministry, and Pitchshifter would probably like this band. My advice would be to buy this first and if you really like it check out their follow up album ""Progress""."
2,"get the other album ""Progress""","""Five"" is a good track but that's about it. Most of the songs just have a continuous pattern that doesn't go anywhere, no bridge, chorus, verses, etc. Just boring. There second album ""Progress"" on the other hand........"
3,"What can i say ,it's origanal","I have recently purchased this cd and it is great. The best songs are 5,wrapped,sponge and perfect.If you like tool you will love this band!! I know i did."
1,Close Call,"This game came highly recommended, and had an admirable pedigree. However, the resulting Close Combat offspring just proves two intellects don't make a genius. In fact, this child is simply dull. The squads are awkward to command, and don't have any sense of a.i. The constant need to toggle perspectives adds to the confusion, and ultimately is so distracting the objective becomes muddled. I tried very hard to like this game, and the only saving grace is I bought on sale for under $20. The salesperson told me they predicted they would have a hard time giving it away, to which I chuckled thinking they must have made a mistake. Well, I can't give my copy away to any of my friends. The original close combat series is as good as it gets. Don't waste your $$$ on this dogchild."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE,"Ok, I know all the critics panned it- that's because they over analyzed every aspect. If you just watch it to watch it, and get captivated in the amazing scenery and intelligent, disturbing plot twists and acting, it's an amazing movie. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. See FX @ 11 AM on Saturday, January 6, 2001; to see this sweet movie!"
4,One Strange Movie,"I saw this movie one day when there was nothing else to watch. I must admit I was slightly disturbed by Macaulay Culkins character. He was bizarre and his actions appalling for a twelve year old. On the other hand, Elijahs performance was the relief of the movie. The innocence and childlike fear he conveyed exactly matched my emotions. The disgust and hatred he felt toward Macaulay's character was intense and he captured the essence of his character completely. Elijahs performance was the heart of the movie. Overall, the movie was suspenseful and interesting. Even so, it is not for the faint of heart or conservative watchers. Certain scenes are quite disturbing and I would definitely not recommend this movie for any young children. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, then by all means, enjoy!"
4,This is GREAT!,"I first saw this back when it was on PPV in '94 I think... and this is the movie that got me so into Elijah Wood! He is an AMAZING actor, and tho there are violent events in this movie, I think it is still wonderfully done.Elijah and Macaulay are both amazing in this!"
3,Good movie,Hadn't seen this in a long time. Chilling role for Macaulay Culkin. Never see Home Alone in the same light again!
3,Evil is as evil does.,"The Good Son starring Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood may seem like a silly film but I actually enjoyed this dark story. Culkin is anything but likable in this thriller, Wood always gives a good peformance. The two stars have great chemistry and many people see this film as a guilty pleasure, I guess you can say that so with that in mind give this sleeper film a try, enjoy!"
2,Puzzling.... campy?,"Could there be such a thing as a childhood-exploitation film? Perhaps this would be a candidate for the genre. Culkin and Wood are scripted and directed to talk and act like adults, throwing themselves at each other in knockdown dragouts, like little men. Elijah Wood is adorable, of course, and works in hard earnest. Macauley Culkin is a delight to hate; somehow the director must have picked up that by this point in the early 1990s we were all sick of him? Whatever the reason for this casting, and whatever transformations of maturity Culkin may have since undergone, he remains a right howl in this one. Enjoy this picture for its baffling badness."
1,This flick claims to have roots from The Bad Seed...,This was a bad bad ploy for something having ideas adapting from The Bad Seed (1956). I don't buy it. Sorry!
4,really good,"Culkin as a evil son, performance was great. Wood as a relative who comes to live with Culkins family. Wood witnesses Culkins evil acts and tries to save the family from death. Very good and different film from Culkin."
5,Another quality product from Targus,"I bought this case for my husband after the one he had for over 20 years was stolen. He does not use it to carry a notebook computer (usually), but computer software, tools, and accessories as well as standard office supplies like notebooks and pens. He loved his old case, so his expectations were high. He has not been disappointed. Targus delivers yet another quality product."
3,"Fast delivery, but to me Sopressata tasted a little bitter.","Fast delivery, but to me Sopressata tasted a little bitter. Actuall weight of Sopressata is under 1.5 LB (2 LB is parcel weight)."
3,Nothing extraordinary,"I bought this game, and although I am not big on Unreal and Quake and the sort I thought it would be interesting to give it a try.I just found the concept of blowing up everyone and picking up weapons to be boring. I did try the game...gave it about 2 hours gameplay time, and it just was not enough to keep me entertained.The graphics are great, the gameplay is extrememly fast. But the content, well, if you like to shoot and run, then this is for you."
3,Very innovative,"Brand new game engine [for 2003], new gameplays [bombing run].The game is fun, however it drifted away from the Unreal Tournament franchise. There is no assault, there are a lot of Unreal Tournament 1 characters missing and there are no vehicles, as the developers promised.The game is not worth your money, you are better off purchasing the next title, Unreal Tournament 2004"
3,One Of The More P.O.ing Games Of This Year,"I read about Unreal Tournament 2003 in p.c. gamer, and i remember promises of 'huge destructible enviroments' and 'a two person skiff'. So far, after purchasing it for 50 bucks, i have seen no signs of either the skiff or the 'huge enviroment.' I'm not p.o.ed about the skiff, but come on, skiffing is my life, if they take away the skiff... what next, THE GUNS. I mean the graphics are great and the gameplay, realistic, but THERES NO SKIFFING. I HAVE BASED MY LIFE AND MY RELIGION AROUND THAT GAME REVIEW, waiting for the game to come out-with a skiff-but alas, no skiff. Where has the world gone when you can promise-but not deliver-the skiff. IS THERE NO END TO THE TORTURE."
5,WOW!!!,"This has got to be the most fun game I have played yet. I'm usually a rail gun team deathmatch kind of guy, so i can't really comment on bombing run or ctf, but deathmatch has outstanding graphics and gameplay. I actually called in sick to work the day after I got this game so i could stay home and play all day."
4,"Collectors 5th CD ""Kamasutra"" Info","For those who care, the 5th CD that was included in this collection back when it came out is listed as the NPG Orchestra, ""Kamasutra"".The song listings are:1. The Plan2. Kamasutra3. At Last...""The Lost Is Found""4. The Ever Changing Light5. Cutz6. Serotonin7. Promise / Broken8. Barcelona9. Kamasutra/Overture #810. Coincidence or Fate11. Kamasutra/Eternal EmbraceAccording to some other reviews here it's a collectors item. Take care..."
1,NPG ruined it...,"I used to own this bootleg back in the early 90's. I saw this CD and thought, cool, Prince finally released it- like the Black Album. I put the CD in expecting to hear that great title track for the first time in years; simple kick drum, slowly building to a climactic jam- like sex. FORGET IT! They NPG'd all over it. obnoxious samples from the start completely destroy the crescendo. A siren?!? this is supposed to be foreplay!..."
1,Awful!,this book cost more to ship......not worth the $....couldn't return because it'd cost more....
3,Much better than the yin yan kack,"you see when a wu artist is under rza's instruction the weakest of Mc's with limited things to say can produce a pretty good album. i remember buying this in the summer of 96 and i enjoyed it more to do with the beats than his actual lyrics. he did how ever show skill on the title track the pillage. cappadonna only sounds good when he raps fast, when slow he sounds terrible as proven on his new album the yin and yang. cappadonna showed so much potential on the ironman album but he has seemed to have dropped of severly. this album is good because of the beats guest wu artists and cappa in some tracks such as RUN, THE PILLAGE, 97 Mentality, Black boy and oh donna. right now im just waiting for master killa to drop"
3,Wu - Cappa,"The Pillage of Wu-Tang Clan's frequently featured and once member Cappadonna's debut solo release didn't have the sting as expected from Killer Bee album. Even the help of the Wu, could not save the swings he throwed with this 16-track release. What impeded this album from being better was the unfinished, mediocre production as the lyrics weren't enough to save him. The title track featuring Killa Bamz is an eerie example of what he's capable of. ""Splish Splach"" has an uptempo feel where Cappa's imaginative slang ran laps around this track over one verse. 4th Disciple's jazzy horns over a repetitive kick drum on ""Check For A Nigga"" was a formula worth cloning. Another smooth or laid-back groove, ""Milk The Cow"", was simple enough to keep your head nodding to the horn laced track. ""Supa Ninjaz"" featuring U-God & Method Man was enough to rock your body over an off-beat guitar strings were on track. The Pillage had only enough for just one sting powerful enough to mention and take heed of."
1,Wack,OKay rza did his job as far as the beats on diz album ? Classic but the lirycs ? Awfull... I got diz only enjoy the beats but cappa is horrible @ rhyming. Skip & copy gza's liquid swords or ghost's ironmman...
3,duh pick this up,i thought this was a combination of punk and puke meets hair and metal and the finish product is punk rock at its finest! the drums on this record was fast and talented and all the songs made you sing along with it after you heard this album a few tymes
4,Bubbles for my dogs,"I got the bubble machine for my dogs for Christmas. I expected the size of the bubble bottle to be bigger. Runs out of bubbles pretty quickly, and it's also a little noisey. My smallest dog is afraid of the noise."
4,Set it an forget it,Turn it on and watch the little ones FREAK OUT! It eventually got clogged with old soap and was a minor pain to clean. It put out a good amount of bubbles and my kids loved it...they danced in the bubbles for hours.
3,Broke quickly,"We bought this gift for our 2 yr old, it began leaking bubbles and liquid and was broken within 4 months."
2,Wish it was more durable,"It was fun while it lasted, but I hate how poorly toys are put together these days. What happened to well-constructed American toys? For one thing, it eats up WAY too many batteries. They should make it run on a 9V one instead. All those AAs cost money! And then after a couple months it just stopped working altogether. My husband tried to open it up and fix it and could only get it running again by wrapping the whole thing up in black electrical tape. Everytime it stopped working my toddler son and I had to jiggle it just right for something to connect right again. Frustration, frustration. We give up on ever getting one of these again!"
1,Very Disappointed,I do a lot of research before buying anything and this product seemed to come out pretty far ahead of other bubble machines. All I can say is it stopped working after only a few uses. I've gone back to buying the long bubble wands for just a dollar or 2 at the dollar or party stores. They make a lot of huge bubbles that don't break easily and we never have to worry about it not working. I gave it three stars for fun because it was - for the first 10 minutes it worked.
3,I agree - it rusts out very easily!!,"I loved this toy the first few times, my 2 1/2 year old loves bubbles and it was easier than us blowing them and getting frustrated as he yelled 'more, more'! After about 5-6 uses, it did rust out the entire battery compartment and was a big mess. I bought it at Costco, and their inventory changes frequently, so I haven't been able to replace it, but I'm stuck with tons of solution. A great toy, but not durable!!!"
3,Bubbles go SO fast,I would have given this a higher score but the bubbles go SO quickly. A regular bottle of bubbles is gone in just a few minutes. But if you buy lots of bubbles the kiddos will love it!
4,double the price as at toys r us,"as of 6/7/12 this is available at toys r us for $10.99 not sure its worth paying double the price but is a great toy! my 6 year old loves it. I had to replace the bubble machine after a year because it's hard to get little ones to NOT pick it up and spill the solution into the motor. it does make a lot of bubbles, and is always a hit with the neighbor hood kids."
4,"Lots of Bubbles, Lots of Fun","This makes thousands of bubbles, creating a lot of squealing and fun. Kids love bubbles and this thing delivers them! I gave a 4-star overall rating because we had to buy a second one. Our first one stopped working a little over a year after we bought it."
2,Fun for 5 minutes!,"I read the reviews on this bubble machine before I bought it and still bought it. I shouldn't have. It does make TONS of bubbles (all are the same size (about an inch and a half),) but the bubble solution only lasted 5 minutes. I was going to order more online, but it's too expensive. I only used it once and for 5 minutes!! =("
3,Almost what I was looking for...,"Overall, the case is great--fits the nano perfectly. It comes with the hand-grip and a belt clip. My biggest gripe is the fact that the case does not support the Nike+ sensor without leaving the dock cover tucked in the front. But I like the case enough that I ordered a second one with the aim of customizing (or breaking) it to work with the Nike+ sensor."
4,The feeder I got is not the one pictured,"The wire mesh cage is domed at the top, rather than flat as in the product pictured. Unlike some other reviewers, on the feeder shipped to me the filler cap at the top is metal, and comes with two sliding metal clamps that do a good job of holding the cap on. I suspect it is a sturdy enough design to keep out squirrels. My feeder is on a pole with a squirrel baffle, so squirrels are not my problem. Grackles are my problem. They dominate the feeders, and can empty one of seed in 3 or 4 hours. This feeder does a pretty good job of keeping them out. The most ambitious grackle can strain enough to grab a seed or two, but they are no longer able to just gorge.Even though I didn't receive the feeder pictured, the one I did receive seems worth the price, so I kept it. I have pictured the shipped product above."
4,This book lives up to it's title,I found this book to be a very interesting and fast read.The chemistry between Paris and Tyree made the pages turn very quickly. Paris and her brother had been through quite a bit not having their mother around but the influence of the grandmother was right on target. I would have liked a little bit more background on the relationship between Tyree and his lunatic mother but I'm hoping that that's maybe another book.Reviewed by: R.Evon
2,Beware!,"Not a bad game, but unlike every other golf game out there, Tiger Woods for GBA has ONE and only one course. There are some challenges, but one course gets kind of boring pretty quick. Jeez, even Mario Gold on GBC had four courses. There is no excuse for this!"
5,faraway places in time and space,A great quick reference to significant places with some of the oldest names on this planet. Historical in its content and very informative. I am using it to prepare for my coming trip to Israel.
5,An excellent quick reference for any busy professional.,"Voices of Qi is a pleasant way to obtain a great deal of TCM information in a short amount of time. Mr. Holland has the skills and talent to present some very new ways of thinking in some very familiar ways of thought. The book bridges the Eastern concepts with the Western mindset and does so with ease. With the rise in public and private interest of acupuncture this book should be read by all. It is one of those books that makes one say, ""I wish I could write like that"". Also, the book has very beautiful illustrations and design from cover to cover. I highly recommend and suggest this book for everyone, from M.D.s to massage students."
5,TCM Intro Guide,I found this book to be an excellent guide to introduce the reader to TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine). It is concise and basic so that you understand the concept of TCM. It opened up the door so that i was intrigued to order other books to enhance my knowledge. An excellent starter for TCM inquirers.
3,general information,"This is a good book for general and basic information about TCM. It lacks details about treatments and diseases, though."
5,A must read!,Sharlene Hawkes is an amazing author with great insight into the human psyche. I highly recommend her book for anyone who wants to have a better understanding of how to expand their self-image.
5,Love It!!,"We have had this for 5 years. Our 5 yr old used it and now our 2 & 3 yr olds love it. It has held up very well. The colors are still bright and the rope is in good shape. Our 40 lb, 40 inch tall 3 yr old has not problem fitting in this. Highly recommended item, worth the money!"
3,this is fun but one,"my parents got this swing and my dad wants to put duck tape on the bottom and my mom wants to put plastice claps on the thing is if you read this and you want to put duck tape on the bottem don't , because its not safe."
2,"OK for Breeders, not for casual pet owners","I agree with the other reviewers. This book is great for breeders and it is interesting, but holds little educational value for someone who just wants to improve the life of their betta pet. I was disappointed."
5,Great for group study,"My mom's group chose this as our study book this year. We're taking it chapter by chapter and discussing the book in relation to our own experiences, and we've found a great deal of similarities, yet many great tactics for creating peace in our homes.I like the way Nelson gives real examples and solutions/options for a more peaceful approach. I'm sure the other books in this series are just as helpful."
3,Great for perfect scenarios.,"I really enjoyed this book and it got me hyped up in the beginning but it didn't exactly explain to me what to do when my 6 year old is having a tissy fit over the smallest things. Well into chapter 7 the book is still saying ""this book is going to help you learn to....."" but it didn't really go into specifics except why positive discipline is important. It gave examples like ""Little Johnny was upset over something so his mom told him to go in his room until they could talk about it. 5 minutes later he calmed down and they were able to come to a conclusion"" awesome. I'd love if that happened with my 6 year old but he doesn't just go in his room and calm down...."
5,The best parenting book I have read!,"This book is a real gem. Our copy of the original edition is well loved and worn. Since it was recommended to us by our daughter's elementary school counselor almost 6 years ago it has been read and referred to many times. To me it was a parenting book that finally made sense and spoke to my heart. This book is based on the idea that everyone (including children) should be treated with dignity and respect. It is about HOW to use kindess and firmness at the same time. It is clear, practical and easy to read. Although the ideas felt right to me they were not the way I was raised and were awkward to put into practice at first. The effort was well worth it. It has transformed our family in very positive ways. It has made being a family fun. I have recommended this book to many, many friends and patients who have enjoyed it and been able to use it successfully. I whole heartedly recommend it to you!"
5,The Squared Circle,"Snell: ""Did you shoot free throws after pracice?""Sonny:""What d'you think?""Snell: ""How many?""Sonny: ""What d'you think?""Snell: ""hundred right?""Sonny: ""Yeah""Snell: ""How many did you make?""Sonny: ""I just told you.""Snell: ""So you shot a hundred and made a hundred?Sonny Youngblood, a high-school all american shoots 100 free throws after every practice. Thats why he is the best. Sonny Youngblood is a Freshman at Southern Illinois Universtiy. He's potential on the basketball floor is amazing. The book is about how his life is in SIU. This book is the best book I have ever read. Its got great excitiment and I can never put it down. If you have not read this book I suggest you do beacause you'll be on the edge of your chair when the buzzer goes off."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS ALBUMS,This an average album not my favorite at all this isn't the Damned from ages back I hardly recogize the group yes I know they had a line up change but this album is just bloody awful don't waste your cash on this instead buy the early stuff.
4,Keeping rock alive!,"It's a great cd. Fuel isn't really known that well and thats what I like. All the songs are good but the best two are ""Shimmer"" and ""Jesus or a gun"" Very good rock music. I hope to see them live someday. If you like Creed or Our lady peace you'll love this. You buy it!"
3,Pretty Impressed,"I was pretty impressed with this cd.Hadn't heard of Fuel, heard ""Shimmer"" on MTV and then I got the CD from my sister, who didn't care for it. I really like it though.Other fav's are: Bittersweet, Jesus or a Gun, Hideaway & Sunburn.The other songs, I don't really care for. They are a little ""hard"" for me (as in hard rock). But those songs alone are so good (to me) that it's worth the cd."
4,Fuel Leaves A Singe For Late 90's Alternative Metal,"Sunburn is evidence that the late 90's alternate-metal crowd had something that rocks and equally, had something emotional to offer. Carl Bell's songwriting displays an appropriate lyrical diversity which makes the album surprisingly artistic. Brett Scallions has a distinct voice which compliments the lyrics nicely too. Fuel knows their influence which is rooted in the late 70's classic metal. The band has a sound that ripples with a menacing stength and proves to be more than a flash in the pan."
1,One of the worst of all time,"Happened to catch this on TV. It is so bad I thought it was a comedy. Truly one of the worst TV movies ever. Music, writing, acting, production value hysterically awful. Can't believe Hugh Grant was ever this bad."
3,Cannot replace the iconic value of the originals,"As in most things, personal taste is crucial. If you are coming to Miles Davis for the first time, this is an expensive way to do it. If you are coming to him after a lifetime of listening, then the original recordings, with their original sequence of tracks, remain irreplaceable. Additionally, the later work of this band is less to my taste than the work on ESP."
5,Great behind the scenes look at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,"The author was the public relations spokesperson for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus he had a great insiders perspective. He includes insightful insider stories. Great read!"
1,not the ones in the picture,"the nerds it describes as Wonka Nerds, Apple-Watermelon and Lemonade-Wild Cherry are not the ones in the picture. i wanted the ones in the picture witch are wild cherry and watermellon but thats not what these are. the company that is selling them has the name of the product and the pictures mixed up."
3,Mac Users - Read this,"This review is directed to those who are newcomers to dynamic websites/and or mac users. Get Joe Kissel's book, 50 techniques for the Mac. It shows you how to turn on PHP. Skip the unix stuff written for the mac. Unless you already know unix, it is a huge project to do so."
4,why need of cupholders? the floor is inches away!,"my husband's orgional Nentindo chair finaly bit the dust this summer so we were on the serch for a new one, when we saw this one at Best Buy. He tried it out and I practacly had to dump him out (the real reason it can rock) he didn't even know it folded! (the orgional did not) I can't belive the people complaining it needs a cup holder! When I sit in it, I can put my hand flat on the ground! and if you wanted a foot and head rest, sit in a real chair! This thing is for proper posture while sitting ON THE FLOOR."
5,Awesome,My sons love the rock & fold chair. They use it when their friends come over and they play games for a long time. They watch TV and rock and love the chair. I love the fact that is folds and i can just store it in the closet and have room to play. Thank you this product is a great space saver and great for kids!
1,eh...,"kind of partial after seing the goofy lookin kid in the picture, but the product itself could use some improvements. Its not that comfortable for anyone over the age of 8 and theres no cup holders or head cushins. 1/100000 stars"
4,Key work in his career,"From 1979, this is Pino's 2nd solo album, and what a beauty it is. 12 tracks that have a great Mediteranean and at the same time Worldly feel when you listen to them. His 1st album mostly being influenced by Pino's Napolitan heritage, his 2nd starts to show his interest in other musical cultures (latin, jazz, blues).You can still hear that his roots were planted in Naples, but with this album he starts to stretch his musical style. 'Chillo e nu buono guaglione' has a nice Latin feel to it, 'ue man!' is a very cool an bluesy track.On this album Pino starts to develop his unique style of world music that is so charactaristic for the rest of his career. That is what makes this album a key album in his repertoire, and therefore a 'must have'!"
2,Disappointing,"Although I am a great fan of Pino Daniele, the CD Title is misinforming....I ordered the product from South Africa and when I received it, turns out it was recorded in 1979 !!!! Only two good tracks......I wouldn't recommend it !"
3,Missing Parts and Misguided Ad,"My feeder arrived missing one of the rubber/plastic nubs necessary for keeping the wires attached to the feeder body. What is more the description implies that the feeder comes with the plastic separators that create different chambers for different kinds of bird seed. In fact, those have to be purchased separately."
3,"SANG-SOO IM, OPUS 3",A bitter reflection about family and the role of women in modern Korea. Im Sang-soo has a unique way to shock the audience with unexpected scenes that will quickly erase the smile on your face. Recommended.
5,"He Helps Define the Term ""Professional Hunter""","This is a wonderfull book about all the aspects of African hunting. Gordon Cundill is a well educated man and that shows through in his writing. He gives vivid and witty accounts of his childhood in Zululand, his most thrilling hunts, and his ideas on the proper weaponry for a safari. He is truly one of the super-stars of the safari world, having held licences in Tanzania, Botswana, South Africa, and others. He has hunted with some of the best including Capstick, Mike Hissey, Mark Selby, and the legendary Harry Selby. This is a wonderfull book by a genius and legend of the modern field."
1,Never Really Worked as Advertised,I have had the unit for over a year and can say it never functioned as a frother. In the beginning it would make hot milk and that is about it.I put it away for several months and got it out today to try again. It sat for 30 minutes and no steam. Yes I had cleaned it thoroughly with water that last time I used it. I threw it in the garbage. I am happy for those who say it works really well but you would be better off buying a Mrcoffee espresso machine and using the steam attachment.
5,Real Good Frother,Perfect stand alone frother. Haven't owned it long enough to determine its stability and durability. For now it works as advertised and I couldn't be happier.
4,Great product,"I run a small nonprofit coffeehouse in a small town and use this product at least 20 times a day and it works great. It takes about less than a minute for the milk or whatever we're steaming to heat up to the proper temp. I couldn't be happier with how it froths. We can only make proper lattes because it doesn't froth enough for us to make capps. But, over all, i am very satisfied with this capresso product and especially its good price."
2,It kinda sucks,"I was so excited to give this to my husband to use for his coffee and for cocoa. There is a finesse in using this machine that we still haven't developed. It's a great idea...but after many tries, the desire to keep trying is gone. I don't even feel good trying to give this away. The phrase ""easy to use"" should never be associated with this machine.... I wish I could take away the stars I gave it when we first got it. NO Stars for this...NO STARS!!!"
4,Steamer,"The steamer is fast, effective and easy to use, but the steam button frequently catches and won't push down easily."
2,Good while it worked,"I had high hopes for this machine because I love frothed milk, but it died on me after a few months. At first it worked well, then it started sputtering, and then one day it completely refused to start. I even meticulously followed cleaning/maintenance instructions (easy to do).Instead I now use a milk frother wand which costs only a fraction of the Capresso's price even when deeply discounted. (While researching Amazon, reviewers alerted me to Ikea's which I have been very happy with even if it does not steam the milk. I preheat the milk in the microwave and the wand produces great froth. The wand has been reliable with constant use and a friend remarked that it also produces better froth than the nozzle from her espresso machine.)"
5,From the Big Bang to The End,"Lawrence Karuss' ""Atom"" does a masterful job of reporting all the amazing numbers that govern the size and evolution of the universe, from Big Bang to Life on Earth to The End. He reports them in language that made me appreciate how big a number with a lot of zero really is. He follows one atom, from the Big Bang all the way through Life and beyond. He makes a lot of comments that give perspective on cosmic history and are funny too. His book encompasses physics, the development of the planets, and the causes of the origin of life -- an unusually large sweep for a book, but he pulls it off."
1,Where is Tess???,This book is not the Tess Gerritsen I know. This is a downright romance -- vapid and heavy-handed--barely cloaked with a bit of suspense.
4,Keeper of the Bride was good,Keeper of the Bride was a good thriller ..Tess Gerritsen has come into her own as a writterI enjoyed it.the Book
3,Keeper of the Bride,I am a great fan of tess Gerritsen so I read all of her books. I enjoy her books with Rizzoli & Ives much better. This book was OK but not one of her better efforts.
3,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed to realize this was an OLD Gerritson novel. Thought it New one I had missed. Amazon info page said published in 2012. Story was OK, could have done without the sex, not a prude but it did nothing to add to suspense. Very sorry to have paid good money for this. Have read ALL her books from Bloodstream on, and without a doubt found Vanish her best. I Don,t follow her TV shows,justice her books and this one disappoints."
3,OK story...,"I love Tess Gerritsen and was hoping this would be similar to her Rizzoli & Isles stories, but I thought it was a little slow and a bit repetitive, plus it was not suspenseful but more of a love story. Oh well.."
3,Not The Best,"This definitely was not typical Tess Gerritsen and I was somewhat surprised when I read the book. It wasn't bad but I lost interest before too far into the story. I more or less just didn't care one way or another about the main characters and felt that they all lacked substance. Tess Gerritsen has written some great books, this one isn't one of them I am afraid. No writer succeeds in a best seller all the time and this is no doubt an early book, she is still one of my favorite authors."
3,Well made but not ideal for my needs,"This is a well made product that didn't suit me as well in time as I thought it would:1) It's metal without insulation, which means that cold beverages on a humid day will ""sweat"" ... not such a good thing in an office.2) If you ""suck"" on the drinking spout, the small air valve that allows air to flow back into the bottle makes a sort of strange noise which, while it didn't bother me, annoyed people around me.3) There is a metallic taste to the water, which isn't ideal.A very well made product that just didn't suit my needs and preferences that well."
1,Never received an activation code.,2006 tour is very good. 2008 tour was received without an activation code. Vendor never responded to my request for the code and Amazon refunded my purchase price.
1,Disappointed,This is a neat game that doesn't work well on my computer. I don't know if it is my computer or the game itself. The program freezes up and has to be restarted. My computer meets all system requirements for this game. I am very disappointed.
2,Tiger08,Disappointing. Not near as good a simulator as 2004 version. Runs okay on Vista though; prior versions may not.
2,really badly produced,"Many of youwho have LS's tapes know she can make some mistakes and it's sort of cute. THIS IS ONE SADLY PRODUCED AND EDITED Tape.First off the Camera moves erratically twice in the video and makes you dizzy.Then I got all excited because finally there was an attractive man in the group. Oh well proving again looks aren't everything.First off this guy i choreographically challenged and when it Leslie says tap out he does side steps!Then when they do their ""walk up 4 and back 4"" he gets caught in front of a platform and can't move anywhere. Tjis really throws him for a loop. GEEZ!Also not that I don't respect how difficult maintaining weight can be but I almost didn't recognize MARY KAY!. Peraps she had some health issues but she looks much older and has put on weight. If anybody knows about this please comment. I hope she is ok.This video is really not good. A better choice would be any of the others that have boosted walking and do the 2 mile section."
2,Very Disappointing,"I love Leslie Sansone's DVD workouts and I have been purchasing several of them to add variety to my workouts. I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and I was so very disappointed. Unlike many of her other videos, Leslie and her friends are all over the place! The other walkers were continually making adjustments to try to keep up with Leslie and she does not give you heads up before she goes into a new move. It was so frustrating that I have not used it since. Beware. :)"
3,Good idea,"This journal is of course a book of lined pages ready for an eager writer to fill. Nice harry POtter cover and small header art make it a harry potter collectible. The light is a cute addition and a clever idea, but the battery cover is a poor fit and frustrating (and it's going to break easily, or pop off and be lost and then the light won't work because the lid is part of the circuitry)."
2,"We LOVE Strawberry Shortcake, but......","We LOVE Strawberry Shortcake! That being said, this video is very hard to watch! My daughter doesn't mind it, but she's too young to care just yet. I cannot STAND listening to it. The voices are shrill when they are in a conflict mode. They are trying to put together a good story with lessons, but my gosh....can we tone down the brattiness and screaming and horrible dialog to show conflict? The older Strawberry Shortcake videos are better at this than the newer ones are I'm noticing. I will have a very hard time buying anymore of the newer videos. Too bad, because we all really LOVE Strawberry and her friends."
2,Game Boy Advance Console,"I purchased two game boy advances with the understanding that I was making a quality purchase. While I would agree that the game boy console is very sleek and convenient for anyone to use, I have to say that I am sadly disappointed with my purchase. Once you place a game into the console to play, it is very dark and hard to see which makes it extremely difficult for young children to enjoy playing. My overall rating of this product is three stars.Sincerely,An Annoyed Aunt"
3,Its a trade off.,"Yes, the gameboy advance is a pretty fun system. It looks great and is very comfertable. It also has a many more games available than other counsoles. However, the backlight sucks! I am not overreacting. There is no way you can call this a portable device, when you need such a strong light scource to play it!!! i swear, you need a spotlight to play this. I would recoment buying a Game Boy Color. First off, the backlight is not as bad, second, it has a better build, third, the games are more classic"
2,Two versions?,"I can't understand the 5 star reviews of this system. I wonder if they got a different version. My version is unplayable under all but the most precise lighting conditions. And some games are unplayable no matter what. With a 80 watt light 1 foot from the system, carefully angled so to try to avoid the glare, Castlevania is still not playable. Its very frustrating because the sound is excellent and graphics(from what I can see) are good. I don't understand how Nintendo could release a product this flawed. That's why I wonder if they have revised it and are now shipping a new version. That's the only way I can explain the good reviews."
4,Wonderful!,"Listen, why would you play this instead of a GameCube, PS2, or an XBOX?IT'S PORTABLE.Listen show me a system you can hold in your hand, take to the park, and enjoy for hours and hours -- that looks better than the GBA graphics, and i'll switch.Yes they failed on the backlighting, but if you go to [website] and buy the afterburner product, you'll get a beautifuly lit GBA that you can take anywhere."
1,Screen Difficult to See,"My grandson wanted a GBA for Christmas because his cousin had one and he had played his cousins and they would be able to share games--I also purchased six additional games. I paid nearly $60.00 for the GBA to ensure I bought a used one that was good quality. In total, I could have purchased a new DS system. But since my grandson wanted the same system as his cousin, I purchased this unit. However, you can barely see the screen even in direct light. I have had to buy 3 additional lights and have given up--I am now buying the Game Boy Player so he can at least play the games I purchased."
4,is this one for the kids?,"Nintendo may have taken a beating from Sony over the last couple of years; the N64 just never quite developed, while the Playstation was blowing out of stores nationwide. However, Nintendo owns the hand-held market, and steps it up a notch with the Game Boy Advance.You know the stats, dimensions, and what it has under thehood...there is no question that the technology is on the money. My concern are the types of games that Nintendo is choosing to release for the GBA. Most of them are games for kids, stuff like Jimmy Neutron, Hot Wheels, Harry Potter, etc. In fact, I think Nintendo in general is marketing its product towards the younger crowd.This system has a lot going for it, but only time will tell on the issue of kids games vs adult games. I have a feeling it will be a very unbalanced ratio."
4,everything i expected,I have no issues with this purchase. I can play my games without problems. there were small expected scratches on screen
5,THIS THING IS SWEET!!!,"Don't waste your money on the gameboy color! This sweet new system is only a little more expensive, but it is about 100 times better! The graphics on this thing are unbeatable by any other handheld gaming system! people say that the screen sucks but I think it's just fine! This system has many great games, and the best thing about it is that you can actually play all gameboy games on it! So if you decide to get a gameboy, get a GameBoy Advance!!!"
1,Get the new GBA SP,"The original GBA is an eye-killer because its screen is so dark. Even though the LCD is active-matrix, you can't see much even under the best lighting conditions. Get the new SP edition instead; it has built-in frontlight."
3,gameboy,This was purchased for my 2 year old since he always wanted to play his big brothers DS and he loves it
3,"Fun to Play, Hard to See, and Expensive to Upkeep",It's fun overall. Too bad it has no backlight and has AA batteries as the standard. If you use it for any extended period of time you will end up wasting money on batteries. See my full video review at[...]
1,Ugh.What's with all the darkness?A total waste of 70$,Buying lighting devices didnt make it worth it they always broke. The screen is too small and the system is a battery hog. Why would you want this when you can play Game Cube and N64 on a much larger screen with better graphics and sound?This is the worst system since Virtual Boy. I hated it so much I chucked it in the lake and I didnt even regret it.
1,This GBA Was horrible,"I bought this a few years ago because I sold myGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsince I bought aNintendo DS Lite Onyx Blackand later came across some of my old GB Color and Black and White games I thought I lost in a move. This is crap compared to aGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsystem (or any GBA SP). The screen is so dark on this original GBA System, I have to shine several lights on it to see the screen and sometimes the glare of the lights makes it even more difficult to see the screen. Just stick with a DS or an GBASP system to play GBA Games."
3,The Mediocre Legion,"I would recommend that you not buy this game for the following reasons:1.There is really no attacking or defending. It seems like every battle is a meeting engagement.2.Combat can get to be quite boring after a while. You usually know who will win when the battle opens and I was surprised to find that you can't control your units during the battle.3.Cavarly units are very weak and their initial charge has no shock value.4.In combat, units just march at each other and fight-there seems to be no tactical skill involved; the AI is exceedingly dumb,and the combat music can get very boring.All this said, this title is an average game. You may like it if you are a history buff, and the patch 1.06 improves a little on the games original flaws."
4,MB's Review,"excellent gameplay, nice graphics. However, the only problem is that it only has campaign missions and no ""random map"" scenarios."
1,Broke after only about two months!!,"I bought this because I wanted a stepper that I could use and then easily put away. It worked pretty well for about two months. I was using it three or four days a week for about 20 minutes each time. Today, I was using it as usual and the cable that makes the steps go up and down suddenly snapped. I'm an average sized woman and way below the suggested maximum weight for it. I'm really disappointed in this stepper. I may contact the company for a new cable but I'm not sure I want to keep using this thing if it's going to break again."
4,The Simpsons Season 13,"Good episodes accept for the quality. The quality of these episodes would not work on my plasma tv. The objects are too white, I'd recommend playing this season on a old tv. One thing I'm glad about is that they didn't show the banned episode Bart's Special Choice which was supposed to air in 2001. The season is good and I would recommend it to any Simpsons fan."
4,"Good, Not Great.","This season of the Simpsons was, honestly, average. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't feel that it had that sparkle that some seasons do. It is the last to be cell drawn before they moved to digital, so it is notable for that. The extras included are what you have come to expect from Simpsons sets and the Blu Ray format does really add a lot by making the colors really pop. Not the best season for a newbie to the show, but fans will enjoy it.Season Rating 3/5Presentation/Extras 5/5Overall 4/5"
2,Limited = Bubble head box,"I love the simpsons, and I've been waiting a while to get this but the description of the product didn't mention that the limited eddition is that stupid bubble head plastic stuff. When I saw what I got I was really bumbed out. Then I noticed that there is a Blu-Ray version. Heck yeah I'm gonna get the blue-ray version so I can watch it on my new TV.Limited eddition = bubble head boxBox set = standard DVD with standard boxBlue-ray = standard box, just in Blue-ray format"
5,One of the best suprises,"This is one of the best, and most suprising albums from the 80's and 90's. Most of the songs on the cd could've been a hit anywhere if they would've been pushed properly. Mary's Prayer is one of those rare songs that actually make me stop what I'm doing and really listen, not just to the vocals, but the backround itself. The members of the band are truely musicians in their own right."
4,Fine '80s popcraft,"I missed these guys first time around (late '80s), and only picked up on them after their biggest single, ""Mary's Prayer,"" was featured in the film ""Something About Mary.""What do they sound like? Danny Wilson has been compared to The Big Dish, The Blue Nile, Prefab Sprout and Deacon Blue; to me they sort of sound like a sleek, British pop version of Steely Dan.Over the years, they've developed the sort of cult following that usually develops with artists possessing well-honed songwriting talents. Worth checking out."
1,"Good lookiing, functional but inferior build",All three styli broke in less than a year. I am back to using the original stylus ugly but unbreakable
2,Weak Effort,This album is a cruddy follow up to an album as good as For God And Country. This album sounds weak and unoriginal.
4,Good Value for the Money,I purchased a unit in December for twice the price that is listed now. Yes it took some time to load 200 dvds but the operation was flawless. I also own a Sony Cx985v which holds 400 DVDs. Although the unit performs fine the disc filing feature was a nightmare. I had to type titles in and it was slooow.Now my wife can search for a movie and play it without a problem. I am also in the process adding a xbox 360 to extend the video and audio to other rooms. I plan to order another unit and daisy chain them together. I agree with a previous reveiwer. Media Servers are thousands of dollars. My entire investment is under $ 1500 excluding the dvds.Even if you decide to purchase a monster hard drive(a higher cost) you still have work around the copy protection on the DVD.
1,Don't run in my DVD player! Thanks Cesar.,"I can appreciate the value of trying to save a buck, but seriously Cesar, you couldn't have had these manufactured professionally? My DVD player is maybe 3 years old, and these DVDs don't run in it. I have been able to burn DVD slideshows off my computer and they run in my player just fine. I checked and double checked that the DVDs I ordered are the correct format, so that's not the problem. Great, I can watch the DVDs on my computer, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of ordering a DVD? I could have just signed up for his online videos."
2,Millans DVD'S,"Save your money, Cesar is just selling DVD'S and not giving enough information to do the training your self. I bought $45 worth of his DVD'S and won't buy any more. He does not train you to do the training and refers training to professionals instead of teaching you how to do it yourself."
3,Pretty decent - could be better,Got a new pup and bought the series for leads on how to raise it right.Its a pretty good series with live examples - featuring grown dogs. The last DVD has very good chapter on adopting a pet - absolutely excellent tips and a must for folks considering adopting and getting a new pup.Only thing I found a bit lacking was on housebreaking. Wish the chapters were a bit longer and had more tips. Except for that its a worthwhile purchase. Particularly ideal for time pressed folks.
5,good book full of great Info,a good book for people who are just starting out with parakeets full of wonderfull Info & has great picturesgood price too
2,A Valiant Mismatched Effort,"This recording is a perfect example of how, sometimes, a beautiful, classically trained voice can utterly destroy the spirit and energy of excellent pop music.Very disappointing."
2,All the same songs,"This is my first Elvis Costello cd and I thought it would have him singing with the lady or some of the songs. But alas I was mistaken! The songs go on and on and after awhile all sound the same. What a dissapointment and a waste of money, although she does have a wonderful voice. Maybe I'll give it to my Mother, it will help her get to sleep."
1,Shamelessly Self-Indulgent...Painfully Artsy,"I suppose I should find something nice to say about this album and that is not hard to find. The studio musicians are supberb. The rest of it is superficial and,The song Broken Bicycles seems easily the high point of an album without many high points."
3,Too Small?,It seems to be a quality product with a strong magnet but the box is too small for a car/truck key with the plastic headed key. :-(
1,FRUSTRATING,"It is nearly impossible for the monkeys to hook on to the tree! I would consider this a pretty lame game. My daughter has invented other ways to use it, like how many monkeys will fit INSIDE the tree, etc."
3,disappointed in delivery,"purchased for a gift, but box was so battered, it was not usable!!!very disappointed and embarrassed to give away"
5,Her best novel yet,"Nahid Rachlin has done it again, this time with a suspenseful story about a brother and sister united by a secret. The novel moves quickly, and the reader is left guessing from page to page until the surprising and satisfying conclusion. The author's knowledge of Middle Eastern culture gives the novel a very authentic feel, and I especially enjoyed the references to Persian poems and lullabyes."
4,groovy,"this is groovy, one to get!! grab and enjoy for only 4 bucks american and about 8 bucks new zealand whoa!!! i got a steal!!!"
2,"Awful, don't buy!","I love Deicide but this pails in comparison to any of their other albums. Get Legion, Deicide, Stench of redemption or Once upon the cross instead. The production is terrible on the drums and the music is bland and sounds forced. -Dre"
1,...,"I am a fan of any kind of heavy music from Death Metal to Punk, but i am sure that any big death metal fan out there can do lots better than this. All Glenn Benton wants to wright about on all 6 CDs is killing holy leaders. This is no different...Unless you really do worship satan, skip this reptitive waste of cash.If your a death metal fan then go listen to ""Hartwork"" by Carcass, or ""The Bleeding"" by Cannibal Corpse, or""Slowly We Rot"" by Obituary."
1,"Ladies and gentlemen, DEICIDE!","Fresh from Wooster, AR (home of the seventh largest twine ball in the world) comes DEICIDE, the hot new progressive/jazz/blues/fusion combo! Deicide combines soothing melodies, talented drum solos, and smoooooooth bass. These lads are so talented, you would never know they are only in their late teens to early twenties! Deicide has been playing the club circuit for about three months now, and they have a new radio hit on the way, ""Bubbles"". The sax solo in that song... breathtaking. Listen up for them; for the future for Deicide is so bright, they've gotta wear shades!Just kidding. This is garbage. They don't have a lead singer/vocalist, they have a lead belcher. ""YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP! YURP!"" Also, guess what else: NOT HEAVY. Also see my dumb review for Cannibal Corpse's meaningless CD. If you own this CD, use it for a coaster.Skip this one. And all of the not helpful votes this review will be getting, be damned. Have a nice day."
5,Great product from Silver Insanity,"I agree with the other 2 reviewers - this pendant is big and beautiful! I guess perhaps it is made of natural stone, the one that I ordered is as deep a blue as shown in the picture, with streaks of paler blue. But yes, it is much bigger than I expected it to be, and that was after reading the previous reviews.It is worth the price I paid for.Yes, another great product from Silver Insanity."
1,Disappointing,This was a very disappointing book. I think many of the citations were old and some of the therapies made almost no sense from a practitioner stand-point. I also think that some of the therapy choices for the elderly were entirely wrong.I would not recommend this book.
4,Nice enough.,"At first I was a bit dissapointed because I was expecting it to be much thicker and warm, it turned out a lot thinner than I hoped for, but given the price is a very nice product and it looks pretty good, I just thought the knitting would be more tight."
2,one out of two ain't good,"Bought two. One worked fine--nice size and weight, reasonably bright light. No beam focus, though. The other never worked at all. Swapping out parts revealed a bad battery pack. It wasn't worth returning."
1,"dud, doesn't work","This product is a dud. I bought 2 of them, and neither one worked beyond the first few minutes. Replaced batteries, and the object simply does not work. Unfortunately, the product cost more to return than to throw out, so I am stuck with it but would NOT buy this piece of junk."
1,WARNING this is a dangerous product - they say,"As a prior reviewer noted, there is a grim warning on the package. It also refers to operating instructions which are NOT included.I contacted Amazon customer service, who disavowed any knowledge of or responsibility for the item and referred me to the vendor (eToolsCity).Quote from customer service: ""I see that my previous colleague had already forwarded your valuable feedback to our concerned department so that they can investigate and update full details regarding this item on our web site.""I see no mention of the above warning or any other changes in the product description as is promised above.I have not contacted the vendor, this is not worth the trouble. I will be returning this product."
5,Just what we needed!,"I got this flashlight because I needed one for the car in case of an emergency.. The color is pretty, and is very bright. The only thing is it will cut out for a second, but come right back on, I guess maybe I might need to change the battery."
4,great to have.,great and bright flash light. It's small and compact. You can keep it in your pocket and it's just like carrying another cellphone.
1,Unreliable,"I read the reviews saying that the contacts weren't good and caused the light to be unreliable, but figured I could use some of the workarounds outlined in a number of the other reviews.Well, they are all right. This flashlight clicked on once, then went off on its own. Yes, you can get it to work occasionally by smacking your hand against it or sanding the contacts, but not frequently enough that I would want to rely on it. I could not get it to work for more than a minute. Waste of money, but at least it wasn't much money."
4,just a flashlight,"Nice little flashlight, quite bright. I also bought the 21 led and it didn't work so I sent it back."
3,Super Bright 9 LED Flashlight,I really like the size which is small and compact. It can be put in a purse or pocket. It is a very bright LED light which I find very useful. I believe there is a design problem that the seating of the LED circuit board in the front lense mount dosen't always allow contact with the battery pack behind it. Sometimes a few LED's don't light until you push on the front lense & cicuit board thus seating it better in its housing. Perhaps the manufacturer will correct this design short coming in the future.
5,"Europe, the band","This is one of the best hard rock bands ever. This album will not disappoint. Great songs .If you love hard , melodic rock, you will love this one.."
4,Follow Up To Coundown,"Does actually that, feels a little bit more bluesy. Great ballads ""Open Your Heart"" ""Tommorrow"" although ""Coast To Coast"" was a little cheesy. ""Ready Or Not"" just flat out rocks!! Europe again shows how talented they are, great vocals, good guitar from Kee, maybe a little too much keyboard but it worked fine on ""Superstitious"" Problem here is this is the follow up to a very successful album ""The Final Countdown"" it was destiny that it would take a back seat. hearing it now after all these years it sounds good, and worthy."
2,it could be better,"i recieved this camera as a christmas present and was initially very pleased with it. however, once i started using it more i began having problems. the camera would click and then shut off without taking a picture. if i put brand new batteries in it, it will work, but after about 10 pictures it starts doing that shutting off thing again. i talked to polaroid and they basically told me that the batteries will not last long and that's the problem. i rarely use it now because the batteries won't last (even if i don't use the lcd monitor). also, it won't keep an accurate record of how many pictures i've taken. i don't think it's right when it tells me how charged the batter is either, because it says it still has half a life and then it shuts down due to batteries. all it all, shop around before you buy this one!"
1,Unnecessarily low-quality,"Yes, I know this is a moderately-priced camera. That's no excuse for not providing Windows 2000-compatible drivers, for having serial-cable downloads that take house (sometimes), or for having a USB cable that never worked at all.Also note that a set of batteries lasts about half an hour, so you'd better make good use of the AC adapter!Also note that the camera is not Mac-compatible."
3,support needed,"I have a hp computer with pentum 4 program ,windows XP and i can not load it on to my computer to view my pictures. Can you send me a disk that will work with windows XP."
4,Great Memory Keeper,"Ilove this camera! I paid a lot less for it though. It was an X-mas present, so I could capture all of my daughters growing up. It is easy to use, and I love the software. I have done amazing things with the pictures I have taken. I am even using the ""new"" versions of the pictures to paint. That's something I couldn't have even imagined doing, without all of the editing capabilities. There are 2 drawbacks though, you need to pre-plan the picture, it's delayed between the time you hit the button, and actually taking the picture. Also, either use the AC adaptor,or use rechargeable batteries, it kills them quickly. [...], if you us the camera correctly for the situation, and have a good printer, the printing quality is better than most cameras. I recommend the HP Photo Smart P1000 printer. All in all, this camera is a better than more expensive cameras, at a cheaper price."
4,fun with close friends,"this is a lot of fun to play with people you know well. I would have girls night and some of my friends wouldn't know each other very well and it made this game more difficult, so best played with a few close friends that all know each other"
3,It was a good look at dialogue in America,"Mr. Noll does a good job of explaining both sides with little bias of the communications that are currently going on between the Catholic Church and evangelicals. This is the greatest social concern of our era, division in the Church, so I certainly look forward to seeing more works like this, as well as more dialogue between Christian faiths. I didn't agree with all of his assertions, but the actual logs of dialogue are good for any to hear, Protestant or Catholic."
2,Outdated,"This is the 1995 edition which, while useful in showing how Slot Clubs work, is hopelessly outdated in its particulars. I had understood that there would be a 1998 edition which would have been more useful. None of the newer casinos is listed here because of the book's age. I also know for fact that the club at MGM Grand has changed its modus operandi since this book was written. If you want an overview of how slot clubs work, this book could be for you. I cannot recommend it for current information."
4,Improvement Over Previous Ka-Bar Kydex Sheath,"Ka-Bar's newest generation Kydex sheath is an improvement over their previous model. They did away with the strap that crosses the hilt and kept the main strap that goes around the handle. In my opinion, Ka-Bar should upgrade all the nylon components of the sheath with thicker, stiffer, more reinforced nylon to prevent twisting when the user attempts to unstrap the knife and remove it. The above pictured sheath is an improvement but can be made better. Btw, you still can't go wrong by opting to go with the old leather sheath if kydex doesn't suit you. The kydex sheath does appear to offer more options for securing to vests, LBE, etc."
5,Works great,"This product works like it is suppose to. The knife fits snug,and has many options for carry. Very strong, and reliable."
5,Fits 1211 Knife,"Sheath fits nicely around my 1211 Ka-Bar knife and does not fall out even when shaken. The knife also does not rattle at all and so, I am very pleased with this sheath."
5,Great (also fits USN model),"I received exactly what was pictured. The sheath is designed for a duty belt or M.O.L.L.E. application so throwing it on your tiny belt you use to hold up your slacks. My USN model Ka-Bar fits tightly with the release mechanism functioning well. Be careful, use pressure on the non-sharp edge of the knife to release the mechanism. My daughter was tempted to grip both edges which would fillet your hand when the sharp edge slides out. I received this three days after purchase using the cheapest shipping, kudos for that."
4,good product,The sheath itself is great. I thought that leg straps came with the sheath too but I was wrong. But no worrys I will make some of my own .
4,Good not great,"Fits my knife, the marine Ka-Bar unsubdued, however the lock does not function so it rattles a bit. May fix it with tape."
5,Very exciting game.!!!,I really like this dice game. We played the game with my sister-in-law and she liked it so much she had me order her one too.Lots of fun.
3,not what they used to be,"this would have to be machine heads worst album. I have their others and this one is the most mainstreem and pansy of the three. What happened after the ""more things change""?! It's like they got better quality production and decided to make rap/rock/pop. Well now they got some more popularity (I guess) and they can finally start copying emminem and getting back at the kids at school. This sounds like something they would make for their first album, but their first album was one of the best, and they regressed into this. I gave this 3 stars because, well it is machine head and it's still better than alot of stuff today. Although deafening silence is a more slow song it does have emotion in it i have been missing from other MH albums. I went to a MH concert and the new songs were accepted pretty well, bulldozer is pretty fast and heavy. I just wish they would go back to thier roots and make a heavy album."
4,Very Good,"This is a solid album. It also contains the best machine head song ever written and performed--deafening silence. If that song doesn't move you, you've got a problem. God, the emotion... bulldozer, crashing..., all in your head, trephination are killer as well."
5,Not the best machine head,"nor is it a masterpiece. But what is it? I highly orginal piece of musical art. This cd sounds nothing like machine head of the past or anythihng else by any other band today. The prodcution on this album is awesome, it's got a very live feel to it. I can't say the songs are too complex but every one of them has a certain energy, a vibe, if you will that is just hard to explain. Some of the reviews on here are very stupid. ""machine head will break up soon"" um, no. In fact, they just had a live album come out and they have a new studio album to come out soon. It's supposed to be a return to form so look out for it!If you want to get into machine head, i suggest getting ...The More Things Change. It's my favorite one and one of the heaviest non death metal cds ever.up the irons!"
4,Good punk - just don't expect anything revolutionary,"This is a fun album. NOFX has always been fun, they're not one of the ""serious"" punk bands . . . gee I can't think of an example but you know what I mean. This CD has some great songs on it like the opening track and ""Moron Brothers"" and more. It's also pretty damn funny."
5,awesome,"This book was an awesome mix of terror,faithfullness and brutalty.He (Richard Wurmbrand )describes in vivid detail the tortures he endured as prisoner for 14 years.Not for the faint hearted,but if you like martyr stories--get this book."
5,Awesome.,"I saw NUFAN with Consumed and Mad Caddies on Feb. 18. It was my first concert, (im 13,) and it was so cool! Leche Con Carne was my first CD i got by NUFAN, and one of my favs. The lyrics have meaning, and the rythms rock. Get it today if youve got the money"
5,A True Classic,Every track on this album has a story and a moral. The lyrics are as brilliant as they are varied and in each the music matches the mood of the story perfectly. Some of his best and most enduring songs had their debut on this album which I have loved on vinyl and CD since the 70's. Buy it...you won't regret it.
4,"Actually, I say *** and 1/2 *, but that's not a choice","Well, pop is making its post-grunge come back, with the forerunners of this movement being the Spice Girls and Hanson, with Jimmy Ray, Aqua, and the Backstreet Boys following close behind. Jimmy Ray has taken the Elvis hair, the James Dean stone-cold face, and the Chuck Berry rockabilly movemnt to a synthesis of beautiful, clean, love sick pop. His closest movement towards risqueness is his amusing ""Sex for Beginners"""
2,Hmmm not that great,"I was definitely disppointed by this movie. It was more Hollywood oriented than I expected. It was great to see some Asian American actors and great to see some expression of what it is like to be an Asian American teenager. However, I thought that the violence in the film detracted from the larger meaning of the movie."
3,John Cho is the only reason to see this,"This dvd was definitely worth the $4.00 at half price books. It was a well written story, that's for sure. I thought it was a bit too gritty than it needed to be. If the goal of the movie was to showcase burnt out ""overachievers"" going from one extreme to the other, then I guess it did its job. I think this set a great precedent for many Asian American films to come.John Cho was brilliant. And hot as always."
5,More than just another punk album,"This album has influenced me more than any other album. The lyrics and energy strike a cord with me each time I hear it, eloquent, raw, and loud. This band has found a way to bring melody and intelligence into hugh energy punk, and the result is an expressive, angry, beautiful work. If you like related music but have not heard this, go get it, this is still strung out's best album, although their newest album, American Paradox rivals it. I refuse to name a favorite songe because over the past four years I think nearly every song on this album has been my favorite at one time. Go see them live!"
5,Smooth operator!,"There are many talented modern,jazz guitar players and music but Peter Whites' albums consistently shows a balance of beat, rhythm, funk and always a right touch of groove. His music is easy to the ears and soothing to the soul. You will stop and pay attention when he plays his guitar, sounds seemingly laid back but is crystal clear and full of life. In my mind, he will always be one of my all time favorites in contemporary, smooth jazz genre.-i.w."
2,smooth pablum,"This type of derivative smooth jazz has only one redeemable value-it may lead a listener to discover the true geniuses of contemporary jazz,such as the Yellowjackets,Joe Sample,Philippe Saisse,George Benson,Michael Brecker,Ricky Peterson,and others.At risk of sounding elitist,a person is either challenging their sensibilities enough to inspire new levels of listening,or they're out to invoke ""feelgood"" vibes from music,and I have nothing against that,of course.Music serves so many conditions and senses,it's infinite that way.But for me,guys like Peter White,Brian Culbertson-they're like the grunts in the trenches,workmanlike,dedicated,but unfortunately,limited.Salieri to Mozart is Culbertson to Ferrante.Yuppies need something to play in their new cars,I guess."
4,"ONE STEP FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK","Dark days is a step forward for coal chamber in terms of heaviness. This album sounds similar to their awesome self-titled debut. Compared to Chamber Music, Dark Days is overall a better album. Chamber Music had much more melody and singing on it, which wasn't neccessarily a bad thing, but it just wasn't coal chamber. But the band do what they do best on Dark Days, with unrelenting heavy beats, psycotic choruses repeated over and over again, and great energy with every song. Still it doesn't come close to their 1st album which is one of my all time favorites. But at least coal chamber are being true to themselves and their fans my making a very heavy album and not trying to get on the radio like so many other pathedic imitator bands. So in conclusion, buy Dark Days if you want ""nu-metal"" in its most original and raw form. Don't buy dark days if you like listening to rock radio."
4,Great little light,"Small, inexpensive, and very powerful. The LEDs give this light much better battery life and brightness than a normal incandescent bulb, and the push-button switch on the back makes operation easy. The case is made from aluminum, and has a plastic lens and rubber push-button on the back. The only issue I have is with the durability. This light got dropped once or twice (just from a foot or two), and now a connection is loose somewhere inside, meaning sometimes only half the LEDs light up. Definitely not as durable as a Mag-Lite, but that's solved by not dropping it."
3,"Cheap light, works great","I needed a cheap light, and this is it. It works, so there you go. No problems thus far. Average really."
3,Neiko 9 LED Flashlight,"Pro: Adequate light for looking under under the sink or in dark closets. Decent light for you kitchen ""junk"" door.Cons: The batteries supplied are worthless, the flashlight operated much better on alkaline.Conclusion: If you have low expectations and are looking for a cheap led flashlight this is it. FYI - You might be able to find similar lights cheaper at grocery and department stores."
1,DP,"I only bought this light to bring my order total up, in order get free shipping status. It is very lightweight and cheap. After installing the batteries, I had to shake and bump the light to get it to work, in fact I have to repeat the procedure each time that I attempt to use it. This light is not reliable and is not even worth the small price that I paid for it. This product illustrates the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"". Do yourself a favor, spend a little more and get a real light !"
1,Read the warning,"Here's what the packaging on this flashlight says:""Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known in the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.""So... why is this product even being sold!? I threw mine away, unopened. Thanks for nothing."
4,Good Buy,"I purchased six to pass out to the driver employees. The light seems to be constructed good and light in weight. The emitted light is a subdued bright that is just right for completing paper work in the cab at night and giving the load a quick once over in the dark. I have received no complaints from the drivers. The light met my expectation and I am satisfied. I would recommend this light if you are looking for an inexpensive, light in weight, easy to keep handy source of light."
2,its ok,It work most of the time. Everything is screwed on tight but sometimes needs a little whack and it lights up again.
4,Great flashlight,"fast shippment,it was exactly what i expected, supprised it did come with batterys that was nice, its bright, and light weight to carry in the pocked."
1,Arrived On Schedule But Does Not Work,Made in China and likely a few bad ones in every batch. So far I am unable to get it to turn on. If it did light it would be a great product for the money. My guess is yours will work. But I won't take a chance on another mail order for this product and will get one where I can easily return a defect. It's not worth the cost to mail a bad one back.
1,LED Flashlight,"I would not buy any product that utilizes 3 AAA batteries. Instead I would opt for a similar product using 2 AA batteries. That way, I would be getting two times the amount of juice for 2/3 of the price. I do not know why manufacturers often fit their products with the smallest batteries that they can get away with."
3,keeps going out,keeps going outhave to unscrew cap and put back on to get good connection with batteries
4,"Good, but not the latest tech","This is well built, not one of those throw away flashlights that break after a few weeks.However, now they have single LED versions that are much brighter and even have adjustable focus.I'd spend just a few dollars more and the the latest version."
4,Nice for the price..,"If you don't want to spent up to 50 dollars to get a flashlight for looking the keys in the dark. This is a good option, I think for 5-6 dollars it's a lot what you receive. It has a bright light is economic. And is easy to use.It never fall down, then I'll write you again. I don't think this can take it."
3,Decent for the price,"I've seen cheaper flashlights with similar configuration but this one has a better quality build. The outside is a fairly attractive aluminum with some sort of anodizing. The LED's put out a bright, though slightly bluish tinted light and it will stay bright for a few hours, then will dim considerably as the batteries die. Put in high MAh Ni-MH batteries and the light output is even stronger, though rechargeables will have a power curve that drops off very sharp but they do last longer. The flickering issue is solved by keeping the rear cap screwed on tight. The button doesn't always work the first time so you may have to do multiple clicks to get it lit, disappointing. Its pretty tiny and convenient to have a few of these around the house, in the car, or just keep one in your pocket just in case. It uses a AAA battery carrier, so don't lose it for the flashlight is then pretty much useless."
5,Very Happy,"Great product, great price. This flashlight is nice and compact, feels solid, and is very bright. All in all it was much better quality than I expected, especially for the price."
5,Excellent,"The batteries lasted my 1 year and it's super bright. I'm constantly working in small places and it's perfect for when you need a light to hold in your mouth while you're screwing somn in, or to reach it into small places. Recommended."
3,Interesting But Limited,"This was a very interesting even helpful book, but limited. I found some of his other work far more detailed. It is intertaining, but don't expect too much."
3,Makes Dylan sound like Pavorotti,"There is some rewards on this CD musically, if you can get past this man's voice. He has incredible fortitude to actually sing and release the results for posterity. His voice is a cracked whine that must pain him to emote. I love the guy though, and it is a guilty pleasure to give it a spin when no one else is around (you won't win friends forcing this one on unsuspecting guests)."
2,Getting boring after playing once or twice,It was a gift for my 9 year old. We thought it would be more challenging but it consistently breaks through after 4 marbles so really not much to play with. Maybe it would be better for a younger child.
3,Quality of filter,Quality of the filter does not match the price. I had anticipated a denser filter medium.
3,Anti-Southern,"Davis is an anti-Southern Southerner.First, I was disappointed in the incredible amount of grammatical and punctuation errors in this book. Second, all Davis can reflect on is slavery, slavery, slavery. Secession, he says, was all about slavery. He rejects even looking at the Nullification crises and their role in what was to later be a major secessionary drive. And he rejects the notion--entirely--that state's rights were the driving issue of the day for decades leading up to Southern secession. However, he reflects more than once on these very arguments, yet never weaves any of it into the basis for the movement to secede. That's a major problem in terms of supporting his thesis. The book is full of good storytelling, but hardly a scholarly tale of truth."
4,A New Frontier In Canadian Music...,"I picked up the Esthero CD about three weeks ago now, and I must say, I am still listening to it everyday! It has solid beats and inventive sampling, which, although entertaining, can also be quite disturbing (see ""Breath From Another"") Indeed, the only song on the CD I don't particularly like is the title track, because of the beginning sample and the rap bridge (not being a fan of rap music). However, this disc is really consistent, and its tunes are soulful and they stick in your head! It was a new direction in music for me, and I am totally thankful I took the plunge!! Great album."
4,Esthero Wild Strawberries,"This is a well-produced, quirky, smooth recording. I read about Esthero on the Wild Strawberries web site. Anyone who likes the cool, sophisticated, pop orchestration of Esthero should immediately get Heroine or Quiver by Wild Strawberries. A little more soulful and absolute gems!"
5,"This CD is Heaven Sent, definitely!","I have listened to this Esthero CD for more than 500 times since I purchased it 3 years ago, and I'm STILL loving it. This is a definitely MUST-Buy. Outstanding tracks - Heaven Sent, That Girl, Swallow Me."
4,Interesting Period Piece,"Caravan is very late 1960s and early 1970s, but the songs are certainly fun to list to."
5,Outstanding program,What wouldn't I give to have been enjoying this magnificent program in that beautiful square in Italy? Fantastic performance of unbelievabe quality and program choices. I wouldn't trade this DVD for anything.
1,Andre Rieu,I still haven't received the DVD After a month in shipment. Very poor!! It was in store when I ordenes it.
5,"Music, music, music","This collection of classic music is as good as it gets. Andre Riew is a musical genious and the production (camara work, bringing in the audience) matches the beauty and sound of the performers. Carmen Marchaca is enchanting. I have played this DVD over and over."
2,DID NOT CLICK,"Andre Rieu in Tuscany did not move me like his amazing Wonderland production. Although the music and interpretation are always great, I feel that a CD would have sufficed."
4,Perfect for an indoor play room,"My G-Baby just loves this little house. At 18 months, she was able to open and close the door with ease. It was perfect size for her indoor playroom, and simple to put together. Although pink and purple aren't really my favorite color combination, the bright colors sparked her interest to investigate inside right away. Fast delivery right to my door, which was great considering it would have never fit in my car!"
5,Playhouse review,I purchased this playhouse for our 2 year old grand daughter and will give it to her shortly. All I can say so far on this is that it was extremely easy to put together.
2,The 80's are over!! Let them die!!,"This CD is garbage. It is unfortunate to see when any great musical genre comes to a head and instead of moving into something new, they try to recycle the good ol' days and mix old styles with new. This CD is exaclty what happens when you try to take the clubs days of the late 80's and early 90's and mix them with modern sounds and things go horribly wrong!! The other reviews comment on how this is great house, well first of all Chicago is the home of house, and this CD is made 10000 miles from that great city so that should tell you how off base it is. But seriously, if you are into really electic stuff that you can't dance to, then this is your album, if you want something you would actually pay cover to hear DJ spin, a much better choice is the clubber's guide MoS 2006."
1,Watch your child with this toy! The balls can fit in their mouths!,"We've had this Gumball Machine for a month. My son received it for his first birthday. He LOVES the toy. However, yesterday I watched as he shoved a ball into his mouth. It actually fit! Now the toy is in the closet until my son stops putting things in his mouth (who knows when that will be.) I wish the designer of this toy would have made the balls a little larger!!!"
1,broke on the first use,the title says it all. i had one of these earlier (i stepped on it and cracked it) and it was way better. the newer ones are made out of extremely brittle plastic.
4,"Good, But Not For Me","I picked this one up out of the cut out bins for a buck. Pretty good white boy Hip-Hop, if that's your thing. Similar in style in tone to The Stereo MCs. Sometimes compared to Beck, but they really are closer to Everlast (at least in his currant incarnation). The songs are groovy and laid back, with fairly good politically correct lyrics, especially `Does My Colour Scare You', `Get A Handle On It' and `Mr. E'. I gave my copy away. B-"
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"There is a lot in this book which makes it ideal for preschool and early primary grade school children.- The art is interesting, uncluttered and full of action.- Although not every picture is a two page spread, many of them are whichprovides a large picture easy to see if you are little and sitting in a group of peers.- The book is full of interesting, and perhaps new, verbs in sentences that help put the word in context. ie: Tumbling, wrestling, racing puppies, Tugging, chewing, chasing puppies.- The book is written in rhyme and with rhythm, making it a fun chant that moves along at a happy pace (much like puppies).- At regular intervals the text has a refrain, ""Here and there and everywhere, Puppies! Puppies! Puppies!"" You will only have to say the refrain twice before young readers with ""read"" along with you. They LOVE to do this.- Almost everyone finds puppies interesting."
4,"fun, interesting read",i think i read this book in a day and a half. its one of those books you can just keep reading and it doesn't hurt your brain. its a great autobiography; it seemed complete at the end and it didn't have many gaps in time. he big up's God in this book and seems to really care about the better nature of everyone. the title is appropriate in that he doesn't allow himself to be molded.
5,VERY DEEP,"This book was deep and straight foward. I have been a fan since ""I Can't live without my radio"". LL has had to overcome many obstacles thoughout his life( His father, Step father and a so called friend) No matter what I strongly beleive that was no excuse for what he did to his wife. But LL you are a strong man who knows how cruel life can be. Keep your head up !!!!!!"
5,I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN,I READ THIS BOOK IN A DAY AND A HALF. THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. MY DAUGHTER WHO IS NOW TWELVE WANTED TO READ AND IT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK SHE WANTED TO SEND A DEMO TAPE TO LL. SHE SINGS AND REALLY WOULD LIKE A START. SHE FEELS THE SAME WAY LL DIDN'T GIVE UP SHE WILL DO THE SAME. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A DEMO FOR HER NOW AND WILL BE SENDING IT OUT REAL SOON. LL IF YOU ARE READING THIS AND CAN HELP ANY WAY PLEASE RESOND.
4,For Life--Por Vida,"An uplifting and surprisingly cohesive album considering both the artists and styles represented. Of course, all of the songs are by Alejandro Escovedo but the bredth of genres he's made music in and excelled at is impressive on it's own. Highlights for me are a reformed and excellent sounding Son Volt, Ian Hunter, who sounds as good as he did in his Mott The Hoople Days, Lucinda Williams who can't seem to record a lousy track and Alejandro's own cut which quickly demonstrates why I have all of his albums. He's simply a great singer/songwriter and I hope that he beats the disease that he's having to fight."
5,Oster Fusion Blender,"I have used the Oster Fusion Blender and am very satisfied. It arrived at my house within 3 days and in excellent shape. I have used it to make applesauce and it is so smooth.Oster BRLY07 600-Watt Fusion Blender with Food Processor Attachment, Black"
1,Didn't even power on!,I bought this for my wife because she loves to make smoothies. We got it out put all the ingredients in and NOTHING! It would even turn on!!
1,"nothing ""original"" or ""kings"" here","Who calls these idiots ""original"" or ""kings"" must be on something. Just a bunch of foul mouths with no creativity or comedy whatsoever - except for those with no taste."
4,VERY FUNNY!,"The Queens of Comedy are the funniest. The Kings of comedy is okay too, but there is no comparing!"
5,"Funny, funny, funny","Haven't viewed the DVD I purchased yet, but I thought the comedy should be a part of my collection. Love Bernie Mac."
4,"More like one king, two princes, and one sucker","Bernie Mac is undeniably THE king of comedy in this movie, his set smokes all of the others. That's not to say that the other's aren't funny. D.L. Hughley is really funny, especially when talking about how black people and white people view work. Steve Harvey sort of MC's the concert and does like two 10-15 minute sets that are decent. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I really didn't think that Cedric the Entertainers set was funny at all. It's a good thing Spike Lee didn't open the film with him because I probably would have shut it off. The funniest part of the whole movie is hearing Bernie Mac's views on child raising, it's just simply hilarious. Bernie comes from the old school of child rearing where it's ok to give a kid an @ss whippin'. Anyway, this is definitely worth buying just for Bernie Mac's set alone, but D.L. Hughley and Steve Harvey do a good job as well...a good addition to any comedy collection."
5,Stop Hatin'! It's a funny movie.,"I can't believe someone thought this movie was boring. I'm going to be real in his comedy routine Steve Harvey wasn't that funny, but other times he was. D.L. Hughley was okay he wasn't all that.Cedric The Entertainer was very funny and so was Bernie Mac. If you didn't laugh at this movie you must be a fool."
2,This is not funny,"I was greatly disappointed in this comedy standup. There were very few moments of laughter. I would highly recommend Chris Rock's Never Scared. These 4 guys couldn't even fill 1 hour and 30 minutes worth of jokes when Chris was able to make great jokes for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The jokes were not socially concious and did not teach the audience anything valuable about life. They all joked about how white people are opposed to black people, all four of them joked on that subject alone, that was completely dry comedy, they had nothing else to joke about so they all joked about the same thing. Luckily I didn't pay too much money for it but I'm going to have to sell it to someone for a lot less than what I paid for it, save your money and time, don't watch this."
5,"Mais uma do Grupo Niche... Bailando, do início ao fim!","E sempre um prazer ouvir as obras musicais do Grupo Niche! Aguardo muito cada lancamento do maestro Jairo Varela e companhia. Com esse album de 2005, ""Alive"", nao e diferente. Baile e delicie-se do inicio ao fim! Cada musica e incrivel! Demasiado bailable!Ha aqui 3 novas (e otimas) versoes de classicos antigos: ""Hagamos"", ""Se pone bueno (Una aventura)"", ""Del puente pa'alla"". E tambem um novo 'sonero' junto a Oswaldo Roman: Grigo Urrutia.Para mim, nao precisava da dispensavel versao reggaeton de ""Hola rola"". E uma ideia muito comercial e nao soa verdadeiro. Prefiro a original (faixa 1). Em todo o caso, este album e muito bom! Nota 10, mais uma vez, ao Grupo Niche!"
4,"Very famous book, but academic content is not excellent","The book Kaizen is very famous and it is often cited. Only because of it's fame, it is worth reading already. Imai shows how production is organized in Japan, and he shows the enormous attention given in Japan to continuous improvement. However, he is rather simplistic about the differences between Japan and the West. However, the book gives a good introduction is some major themes in the field of continuous improvement and it is the origin of many ideas later cited by other. Thus: worth reading if you want to get to know a basic book about continuous improvements in production processes."
1,"Read, don't listen","This review is about the Mark Hammer audio tapes. I agree that he was not a good selection as reader. I listen as I go to sleep and usually get in at least one tape; I fell asleep the minute I heard Mark's voice. The content of the book is exceedingly exciting, but whether the protagonist is in conversation or being beaten to a pulp, the orator's voice never changes. He's just plain BORING while the story never is. Buy the book and read it yourself; I did and found it most enjoyable."
3,The morose Dave Robicheau,"You've got to pay attention and not just go through the motions. We have a rape murder that seems to lack motive...a quiet boyfriend who shouldn't be that scared. The crime and its solution would have been twenty minutes max on Law and Order. Two very different women are all over Clete Purcell...why? How many crooked (gotta pay for their past) genteel families are left in New Iberia? I'm a fan and have read every one. I started when the first book came out...but like Robert Parker, Burke is just stitiching what he knows we like together."
5,this alubum is sick,I have heard all of the lagwagon cds but this one and when I heard it I thought that it was the best.
1,unadvised,"Though this fan looks incredible, it weighs about twice what any comparable fan does. The manual is incredibly inadequate and the instructions are insufficient for installation. The hardware provided is very different from any other fan that I have seen. I have installed and built hundreds of computers and accessories and after a half hour of trying to figure out this beast, I packaged it up and returned it to the store. Furthermore, It is too large to fit in most computer cases. After measuring this fan, I ralized that with luck, it may clear my case by 1/4 of an inch. Unless you are a professional computer tech, I highly discourage the purchase of this product."
4,Remarkable Ludlum Imitation,"While this story is just fine for summer reading, the writer should be commended on his Robert Ludlum imitation. It really is quite good, and it's just the thing for Ludlum fans who want the series to continue indefinitely. It's almost like artificial intelligence for Ludlum fans. Believe it!"
3,NICE RIDE,"FORGET LUDLUM, THINK BOND, JAMES BOND, IN WHAT SEEMEDTO ME OF THIS BOOK, AN UPDATE OF ""DR. NO"" ANYWAY, IT WASA NICE RIDE."
5,"Great product, great price","Not the fanciest wine glass you'll get from Riedel, but you can't beat the quality for the cost. I have no regrets about this purchase."
3,Excitement overshadowed my good judgment,"As one that has an extensive LP collection, as well as an armada of 45's, I was overjoyed when I saw this reasonably priced portable record player. Finally, I could listen to those recordings that had lain dormant for some years, since the death of my receiver and the equalizer that matched it.However, the sound quality of this unit is poor, but, I suppose, purchasers don't want it for its reproductive capabilities. I have heard some multi-function systems that produce a much better sound and at a comparable, or even cheaper, cost.Its portability is its greatest strength but for a more memorable listening experience, one might decide to search elsewhere."
1,Not Recomended,purchased as a gift for my daughter. Did not work first time very poor construction with too much play in the armature and drive mechanisms. Don't waste your time and money.
1,The worst sound ever,"I like to believe that people still make quality products. This is not a quality product.Cheap construction, ""can"" with a string attached sound. It's junk.The motor is so weak is hardly drives the record.The sound lacks richness, it's just washed out."
1,case too small to play 33 1/3 records,I bougt this as a gift to my parents for christmas-spoke to them today and they were so disappointed because the albums my son gave them as well as there own 33 1/3 records were too big and kept hitting the back of the record case when the record spun around-I don't know why no one else wrote about this but that seems to be the problem with the one I bought. Will return for something else-
4,Perfect for me...,"I was looking for something inexpensive but with good sound quality. This was perfect for me. It arrived quickly, no set-up required, and it sounds great. I've started to collect 7"" records again and having a blast. I recommend it if you're looking for something modest with good sound quality."
2,Ok but no Cigar,"They don't make em like they used to.For the price not bad if your not particularabout precision.Don't look for audiophileperformance here at this price.The pros are it does looklike the 50's turntable.It does play but the volume is low.there are no outputs of any kind.It's just a basic player.There were cosmetic imperfections on mine and also manytechnically questionable items like speed variation,lack of precision in the tone arn lever etc etc.so if you don't expect much this little baby might give youa nostolgic buzz."
3,For the price it's Great,"I just recieved the player. The speakers aren't top of the line but it does get pretty loud with descent quality. I'm pleased to have purchased it. If you want something more high end, quality both sound and materials look towards something else, perhaps spend a bit more money. As far as I can tell it play's my 33's at the right speed. As I said it works great for someone basic like myself. However, I do have some complaints; 1) The cover pops off easily from the back and does not have a device to hold it open. 2) Also, the cover must be removed to play a 33, since the lid is too small, 45's and 78's will play with the cover closed. 3) lastly, the materials used in making this product scream CHEAP. I have not used this devices USB connectablity and most likely will not. If you want something to move vinyl to MP3 look elsewhere."
4,"Great Value. Not the Walmart brand,genius.","I bought this for less than [...] bucks. For that price, I could have got a piece of crap, instead this lives up to the billing. It plays all my records great and looks really classy on my desk. This is a must in my house and, again, this record player was great. Classic finish, good sound, great value."
1,Save your money !!!,"Please save your money and do not buy this record player. I tried one at Rite Aid and brought it back. Horrible sound, crooked tonearm, cheap vinyl cover, etc. Nothing like the quality of older record players like the Webcor. Not worth half the money. Forget the older look and other cheap portables and buy a Music Hall or NAD turntable for your stereo system."
4,Portable as all get out!,"Ahhhh....the magic of 12 volts DC.It's really really easy to find the correct plug for these type of units at the end of many 12V power supplies. Get one and cut it off with a length of wire left on for you.I use mine outside all the time, attached to a pair of 6V lantern batteries as a 12V power supply. Done and done, with a few 45s stuffed under the case to listen to while I picnic. The batts also power a set of computer speakers that I put in my bike panniers for ipod use, and so far the setup has lasted a couple months of heavy use at a time."
1,Terrible product,"Bought 2 of these, and neither worked properly , one motor was dead , the other had HUGE speed variance. Just terrible sound and cheap parts. Not close to worth the money. Disappointing in every way , would not recommend this brand, their products are just terrible."
5,more superb Goldbarth,Goldbarth is one of a handful of contemporary poets worth reading. This book is a pleasure -- no surprise there.
1,Couldn't get through it,"I tried and tried to keep reading this book, but it wasn't interesting to me. The General was a pathetic old man who seemed to be living a life of self pity. I got tired of his whining. I know Gabriel Garcia Marquez is very respected for his writing, but I just couldn't get into it. I guess I prefer books that I feel I have something to learn or are atleast entertaining."
3,Crash course in SQL DMO SQL NS,"I found this book to be a big help in creating SQL DMO applications. I got some ideas for incorporating server and application roles via DMO, automating free log space counting and archiving via detach and attach, a way to limit extending the server's context for xp_cmdshell and ways to produce lists for users that are absent from EM (it may be simple, but there *is* no list of triggers for example, and the DMO EnumXXXX methods are a lot easier to deal with than ado's moreresults, when queries return more than one result set). I am a vfp programmer, but in manipulating an object model, the ideosynchrosies of the language aren't supposed to count for much, so I found it straightforward to translate the vb into vfp, and found my way."
1,A waste of time and money.,"I first heard the author of this book on the radio, and found the way he described the subject matter of the book to be quite interesting and intriguing. Enough so that I bought the book. However, this book does not achieve the goal it intends. It is meandering and a work of self-graniosity, and nothing more. I found it quite unbelievable that the other reviewers found so much value in it. After making my way through the first 3rd of the book, I threw it away. If there was a succinct method to describe the method for ""connecting"" without having to read some of the ridiculous things the author had to say, the book would have been worthwhile. But that was not this author's intention. Self-searching and careful self/world observation may reveal greater results."
3,It wasn't what I expected,"I read this book for a book club of 4th grade girls. Most everyone else in the group liked it, but I didn't. It was hard to get into and the improper grammer was difficult to understand. I didn't like how each chapter was completely different. Once I would get into the chapter, it would end and the next chapter would be about something else altogether. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the ending was too obvious and predictable."
5,great purchase,"I am a grad student and these were great to take to school and store in my desk for those late nights, and they tasted good too"
5,lamas lash masque,"I love this stuff! If you are in a rush and don't feel like putting on mascara -- use this. Goes on smoothly with no clumps and makes lashes fuller and healthier. It doesn't permanently color your lashes as it claims, but it does add some tint. Excellent product for those with thinning lashes and worried about using too much mascara."
1,"very generic looking, dissapointed","I was so excited to get this for my nephew who is a huge scooby doo fan, however when I got this, I was really dissapointed in the quality. First, the box was ripped open and it almost looked as if the parts fell out and someone just threw them back in the box. Then the cards are cardboard you have to cut out. The scooby figurine is super tiny too. Just wasn't what I expected."
3,Not his best,"This single was not Bo's best work. Inside Your Heaven doesn't really fit his style. However, Vehicle was fantastic. I'm sure his album will be better."
3,Vehicle has a flat tire,"The horn section on Bo's Vehicle is virtually nonexistent and constitutes a huge disappointment compared to American Idol Band / Ides of March / Blood, Sweat and Tears versions. It lacks the great surprise and thrill of these brass fanfares.They were all set up from Idol for the best version of Vehicle and botched it. Bo's Vehicle needs a tune up."
1,Don't Buy This CD!,"I don't recommend this CD. Vehicle is overdone and his voice sounds like it's hardly there. Richie Sambora is the only reason I'd listen to it. As for the single, Inside Your Heaven, Bo just doesn't cut it. I warn you listen to the tracks first here on amazon. You'll see."
5,"whooohooo, rock on BO!","This CD was fabulous, i love Inside your heaven, it sticks with you when it is sung properly.. i wasn't expecting much from AI or Bo after hearing Carrie's single but I was wrong. Vehicle is amazing to, this guy thrives in originality, keep it up.. thats what people need in music."
1,Dissapointed =(,"AI really should have given this guy another song to sing. I feel embarrassed for him that he had to sing IYH after Carrie has done so well with it. He just doesn't sound that great, sorry, but I think this guy is way overrated. Vehicle sounds bland and boring. I could hear anyone in a nightclub sing this song."
5,Bo Bice rocks on,"I loved the two song CD, and have played it over and over again. I especially enjoyed the mix up of soft, slow love song, and then hot rock and roll following it.[...]"
4,Love this guys voice!,I'm giving this 4 stars mostly on the voice. I really love vehicle and his voice is great on it. But IYH is just not that great even with Bo's great voice.
1,Disappointing screen,"I had read great reviews of the Casio watches and expected to get a great looking watch. This review is based on the esthetics's of the watch and not it's functions...You cannot see the face of the watch, only by looking at it in certain angles. Although the watch may be very dressy, it lacks the ability to see the face of the watch.. PLEASE be aware of this before you buy it. There were no reviews for me to check out.Take notice that in the picture of the watch face the numbers look dim. THE reality of that is far worse. I am going to try to return it."
4,box a little beat up,"Box was a little beat up and looked like it had been sitting around a while, but can't complain since I only paid $20 for it (shipping included.) Thanks!"
2,Great collection of songs but,"Captured is better. It has a better ""live"" feel than this one. I'm just not feeling it with this album. Despite reading most of these (and other) reviews first, I bought it anyway since I like their music. If you don't have Captured, buy that one first."
5,Memories,"I was in High School when these guys were around. There shows were incredible and their live recordings reflect the energy. This one is a must if you enjoy the ""Captured,"" CD as it covers the material released later."
5,Good live hits from Jouney,I don't like all of their work nor everything on this CD but worth having in my collection (only CD I own by them).
1,Not happy,"This is a very tiny version of the original game. It may be my fault, but I was expecting it to be much larger."
3,"I Love Dinu Lipatti and Dutton, but...","Don't get this CD! The reason is that the exact same recording of the Grieg Concereto is available on an EMI References CD that couples it with Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 (Otto Ackermann/Tonhalle-Orchester Zurich). Furthermore, the very same Schumann Concerto is available on an EMI ""Great Recordings of the Century"" disc that also features Mozart's 21st Piano Concerto (Karajan/Lucerne Festival Orchestra). Lipatti is so good, and his recordings so scarce, that anyone interested in him should not settle on purchasing just two concertos when for a little more money they can get four. I am surprised that Dutton released this, they are usually so good about licensing and issuing unique historical recordings. I hope Dutton doesn't turn into another Classica D'Oro -- with them you have to really pay attention in order not to buy redundant product!"
5,100 practical and unique recipes for BSD,"The Hacks series has been great for O'Reiily. There has only been one so far that has not lived up to the series potential of presenting unique and practical content in a tight form. This book follows the lead of those that preceded it. I found helpful new content for myself, like maintaining configuration on multiple machines, and those that I have learned from the best, like using 'screen'.I think any BSD user, end user, engineer, or systems administrator will find something to like in this book. And the great thing about the Hacks books are how they present you with a recipe, which gets you to learn something new, which then expands into whole new areas of understanding. I recommend this book to anyone using BSD."
2,Dont Bother,"I just thought this book is not really that good. Most were not even hacks, but just basic usage. The only hacks book I really liked was by Rob - Linux Server Hacks. I would really recommend that one, even if you use bsd as it has true hacks with tar/ssh/etc. Try the Absolute OpenBSD book too. That is quite good and has a lot of info."
1,Did nothing for hot flashes,"Tried it for 3 months or more - but it did nothing for the hot flashes. I tried it following recommendations and reviews - at first I thought there might be a relief, but it wasn't enough of a relief nor long enough."
2,Stomach ache,"These capsules made my stomach ache. The stomach pain went away after I stopped taking the capsules. I wasn't able to take the capsules long enough to see any results. So I other than the stomach discomfort, I wouldn't be able to review this product"
1,Never again,"I tried maca root because I was looking for pills to make my butt look bigger. I looked up bigg butt pills, maca root popped up. Never again will I use it. It made my abdominal area big."
2,Asks One to Suspend One's Disbelief Too Much,"This coming-of-age story is set in Ireland and follows a girl, Shenaid, and a guy, Darren, who've been inseparable from early childhood. Both are mischievous types, with Darren being the more violent of the two while Shenaid finds his antics all too adorable. When Darren begins to express romantic feelings towards her, Shenaid doesn't know how to take it. Her parents suddenly send her to a boarding school, and she and Darren are forced to spend (presumably) more time apart than they've ever done. Darren realizes that he can't live without Shenaid just as Shenaid realizes that she can live without Darren. Mayhem ensues.What I couldn't come to terms with was the lack of police. Any police. Whatsoever. Darren commits numerous abuses and crimes, even a murder, without so much as a siren going off.I understand it's a film, but there are some things that just aren't credible. Even in fiction."
1,Another waisted effort by the music industry,"When will the music execs ever learn that buyers of movie soundtracks want the memorable and moving scores of the movie and not repeats of ""oldies"" that have been heard over and over on other formats. Please correct this error and reproduce the score without the ""oldies""."
2,A terrific opportunity was missed.,"I purchased this soundtrack for the two wonderful (albeit short) tracks by Michael Kamen. These tracks were well worth the price, but I feel a terrific oportunity was missed by not recording a ""score"" album. There was so much wonderful music by so many talented composers that will never see the light of day, because the producers of this cd went the easy, safer song compilation road. Despite some charming oldies, I feel this was a tragic mistake. I only hope someone corrects this oversight before this music is all but lost. Logan5"
2,Where is the music I wanted?,"Warning! This is not the CD everyone wishes it were! Some excellent original music graced the ""E2M"" series, but astonishingly only Michael Kamen's main theme is on this CD. When I heard Mason Daring's poetic and moving score for the episode ""Spider"" I knew I would pay any price to get it on CD. Was amazed to find that this so-called ""soundtrack"" is almost an empty wrapper. The grand main theme it includes is painfully tantalizing. That such fine work went into the series' music but not into this CD is baffling. Hope someone rectifies this serious mistake with a new, genuine soundtrack."
5,"Panasonic Plasma 37""","Fantastic TV. I saw it at a local discount store but checked Amazon's customer reviews and decided to try it out. (Thank you for the reviews)Great picture, I also have an LCD 32"" and it looks slightly better than that. I hooked up my PS3 and the blu-rays are amazing.Local GTM Discount stores had it on sale for $544. If you have a GTM store in your area they regularly have 20% discounts on their already discounted TV's. (Costco's leftovers)I always compare prices with Amazon and 90% of the time buy my stuff from Amazon but this is one of the times the local store beat them.It stands on the table nicely but I just ordered a wall mount from Amazon that worked great for my older LCD."
2,"Good ideas, poor execution","Though ""Hello, I'm Special"" has good ideas and a good premise, it features very long winded examples that alone could be theses. Although somewhat interesting, this book is too much of a chore to read and is, to be honest, quite boring as leisure reading.Niedzviecki could really also learn that using ""I'm Special"" or ""I'm Specialism"" on what seems to be each page really doesn't help pass the pages any faster.This was a waste of my time to read. Read the first 10 pages and you have the gist of the book; and if you know much about current society, you would be able to realize what he is saying without ever picking up this book."
5,awsome couldn't put it down,"a must read for anyone who loves adventure,suspence and a good quick read. don't pass this book up."
4,"Excellent, Quick Workout","Having previously bought Jackies DVDs I also loved this one.You can choose either upper, lower body or do both. In total about 40 minutes.Sometimes the reps were a bit fast on the lower body, I found it difficult to keep up. But generally really felt the pyramid technique worked well to fatique the muscles and I really felt it the next day!"
2,Just ok,I like Jackie workouts but this one is ok. I don't really break a sweat but my shoulders did feel like they got a good workout.
2,wish I loved it but no,"I have Jackie's book ""this is why you're fat"" (I highly recommend the book, packed with good info about the evils of sugar). I bought this DVD because Jackie knows her stuff. but this DVD didn't cut it for me. the pyramid workout is awesome in theory, however, combining large muscles with small muscles using the same weight didn't work. doing wide rows for the back requires a heavier weight than tricep kickbacks. using a light weight won't work the back just as using a heavy weight compromises tricep kickback form. this is true when working legs and shoulders as well. so I guess this isn't a good DVD for me."
5,I like it I like it alot!,"If your only going to buy one cd this year, buy Limp Bizkit, but if your going to buy more than one definetly buy this one."
2,Disappointing,"""The American Robin"" by Roland H. WauerThis is almost entirely a ""rewrap"" of the works of others into what is, in a word, ""Robins for Dummies"". It very probably could be written after perhaps two, maybe three, hours in any university library. With about 60 pages of text it provides little more than a good, but cursory, snapshot of Robin ecology, a modicum of Robin trivia and the author's positive opinion of Robins in general. All the relevant and useful info in this book could be found in other books that contain discussions of all North American species. One redeeming ""plus"" is that this book, in doing so much quotation of others, presents an interesting array for the varied studies ornithologists have come up with over the passed 200 years."
1,A real stinker,"This was simply a disaster waiting to happen. Sam Neill, former star of JP1, and William Macy, who only a few years earlier played a major character in Fargo, couldn't rescue this film. It was simply bad to the bone! It's rmoured that JP4 is being considered. I hope that they come to their senses and dump the project. You would need a really strong script, a good cast and good direction. In this economic climate second hand work won't go rewarded?"
1,Worst Film I have seen this year,This is without a doubt one of the worst films of the year even with the fine special effects.The acting is bad because the writing is bad because the direction is bad. I would advise anyone not to spend a dime on this film and certainly not your valuable time.
4,"Better than ""The Lost World""","I am a big fan of the ""Jurassic Park"" series, i loved the first one, the second one was well dissapointing, silly, a bit tedious and quite heavy for me on the violence, but Jurassic Park 3 is a big improvement over the second one, a smarter script, very good acting, great action sequences, but the plot seems a bit too thin, but it's quite a movie that reminded me of the first, but if they do ""Jurassic Park 4"", i hope we see again to good old Dilophosaurus, all the characters from the other films, also that we see again Isla Nublar, i think that would be great, Jurassic Park 3, is not Oscar Winning Material, but it does do a big improvement over ""The Lost World"" as not being as cheesey, predictable as the second one, but it needs a better plot, but i enjoyed it."
4,"Far superior to Lost World, JP3 remembers the fun.","Jurassic Park 3 is a lot of things that part 2 could have been and wasn't. Gone are the overbloated casts, the nightime, rainy, dark look and feel. Back in a big way are the dinosaurs, the wild environments, and a handful of likeable people that you root for to get through it all.Maybe that was the biggest problem with part 2, we didn't like the characters in the story, so we didn't care if they made it or not.This is an enjoyable thrill ride that improves with additional viewings. It still not as replayable as Jurassic Park, but it's a very watchable film. While not flawless, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the premise but might have been dissappointed in the sequel."
4,THE BEST OF THE SERIES,"It`s 2 bad that this film holds the number III behind its name... Because it is the best. Inventive, full of good humour and good acting. A N D special effects. It really should have been a sequel 2 the 93 blockbuster... THE LOST WORLD? There`s not enough sand 2 bury than one...Alessandro Nivola`s Billy is good, but his part should have been built up..."
1,If only Spielberg had directed...,"This movie has action, but its just the same old running and screaming, nothing new.It confuses the plot of the 2nd film, portraying the island way different than before.At least the dinosaurs were portrayed correctly in the 1st 2(except the t-rex was a bit too fast).But the Spinosaurus is much too different than the real animal, which couldn't swim, couldn't run through thick iron fences, and WOULD NEVER, EVER BE ABLE TO SURVIVE A BITE ON THE THROAT FROM A TYRANNOSAURUS REX!!! Whatever happened to doing research, Mr. Joe Johnston?"
3,"Should they have stopped at ""Lost World""?","This is a fairly decent film. Dinosaurs, mayhem, and action are all abundant but . . .. The reasons for the continued contact with the dinosaurs is especially thin in this movie. Not only that, they've stretched the believability factor too much when it comes to the intelligence of the Raptors. It was bordered on laughable. Also stretching the imagination and the plot is one large dino that follows the stranded characters everywhere. Amazing how a dino as big as two buildings could sneak up on you repeatedly with success. He even manages to hide in some rather shallow water. There are so many inconceivable occurrences in the movie that I can give it only 3 stars. It's a very disappointing contribution to the series. Watch only when there is nothing else on television."
1,You must be kidding me?,"This was horrible. Every thing in this miserable film is a one mistake after an another. From the acting to the film score, it's all just plain awful. I'm a big fan of the series, and I'm willing to forgive certain things but this is unforgivable, and it should not be tolerated. The way to teach these people from making another Bad Sequel is to not pay to see the next one, because if this is the way they are going to treat the fans of this series then there is no need to help them to make money off of it."
3,Honest review,"Well, JP3 is a decent flick. First time I saw it I was completely blown away. The second time however it wasn't that great. Still the action sequences are amazing. ILM really outdid themselves on the dino effects. But the comic relief starts to wear thin already the second time round, and well, the story isn't that great. It works though, just don't pay too much time to details. Sam Neill is good, as is Bill Macy (as always, one of my favorite actors). So, the best thing to do is rent this, and decide for yourself whether to buy this or not. I don't know about the DVD extras, guess you'll need to find that out for yourself.All in all JP3 is a fun movie, but don't expect mindboggling plots or something."
2,JP3 stinks!,"JP3 is horrible! It isn't half as good as the awesome first two!The plot is the same as the other two and the movie is so predictable! Once I knew all the characters, I knew who was going to die and survive 10 minutes into the movie! Also I don't care for the DVD extras.An extra star for then special effects, but even they are cheesy!Buy 1 & 2 but don't buy this one!"
5,Best JP movie ever!!!!!!!!!,"This JP movie was so cool. Sam Neil comes back for another film. Although short (1 hour 30 minutes) still great. A definite buy. New dinosaurs, and GREAT effects. JP and The Lost World where good, but man this one was GREAT!!!!!!!! It'll keep you at the edge of your seat biting your fingernails."
2,A weak effort at best.,"I'm supposing the DVD is loaded with extras to keep you away from watching the movie itself?The burning question is: How are they going to manage a plot that gets them back to that island...again? Well, they pulled one out of thin air and off we go. The scenery is still beautiful but the aura has faded from this once great idea. Horrid writing is the worst enemy of any movie. There were stories that this one was written as they filmed. It sure seemed that way.Jurassic Park, sadly, is taking the route of the Jaws series. Steadily getting worse."
3,*YAWN*,"Jurassic Park III would have been a decent movie, if it had just a little more originality. The graphics weren't too much improved from the original Jurrasic Park, and the story was just downright unoriginal and boring.I still liked III, it was a watchable flick, but I am glad that I only rented it, and not bought it."
1,poor movie just an exuse to cash in,this movie is poor in every way it is a rip off poor story poor plotting and a dino saur that is a figment of somebodys wild imagine nation and also poor acting liked the first two but this one stinks
2,My bible story book,"We recieved this as a Christmas gift for our son from his grandma. We started to read it to him the next day and realized the language in this book is not what I would recommend for kids. The bible is not exactly G rated as it is, but to put into rhyme form certain stories that I would not tell my kids in the manner they were told in this book was a bit inappropriate in my eyes. There is no reason a toddler should learn about Exodus 1:8-2:10...its violent and after seeing what was written in this book we have started to censor what we read him a little more. There is a time and place to learn about certain biblical stories but being a toddler and learning certain ones too early could be detrimental to the kids in our opinion. To hear a kids rhyme claim ""He killed their male children, one by one..."" seems a bit inappropriate among other stories of similar questionable wording."
3,It's ok,I saw part of it on TV and wanted to watch the whole thing. Parts of it are interesting but some is really not believable and just inaccurate. If you like Lifetime movies I'm sure you'll enjoy this.
5,Awesome sax player and vocals !!!,"Herbie Russ combines Smooth Jazz and Pop into a wonderful Adult Contemporary Music collection. All his original songs are truly awesome.... and his rendition of ""Harlem Nocturn"" is one of the best I've ever heard! Looking forward to Herbie's next CD.... I know it will be worth the wait! This is a must buy for all music lovers of all ages!!!"
2,Adequate book for beginners,"This text does a pretty good job at skimming the vast amount of options and features of ArcMap, but seldom gets into real detail. Because of this, the potential of this expensive software gets largely unused. On a whole, I think it's a small stepping stone towards helping users understand what ArcMap can really do. For such a large book, there doesn't seem to be much in it of serious value. If you're a first time user of Arc software and GIS, this might help. But if you're an experienced GIS user, it comes up way short."
5,Keep you breasts just makes sense!,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast in August 2002. Then I went to the Cancer Control Society's annual convention and met Susan Moss and got her book Keep your breasts. It and her motivated me to cancel a scheduled lumpectomy and take the alternative route. Now I am so glad I did, as the tumor is half the size and Dr. Privitera says it can very well only be a fibroid tumor at this point, as it is in the nature of cancer to grow and not shrink. If I had chosen the allopathic route I would be sitting here with a big dent in my chest and no hair or immune system to speak of, and instead I feel better and more alive than ever. If you have cancer, don't you want to do everything to support your body in the fight against it rather than tear it down until it eventually gives up? Please read this book!"
3,I beg to differ....,"I had a very different experience from the other reviewers. I'm a big fan of time-travel and alternate history novels, and this one started terrifically, but I found the central plot device so hard to swallow that it really hurt the book for me. Without giving anything away, the assumption is that the publication of a _fictional_ book in _English_ which paints Germany in an unflattering light somehow gets the entire German nation in an enormous lather.For better treatments in the same vein, I would recommend either ""Time on My Hands"" by Peter Delacorte, or ""Replay"" by Ken Grimwood."
4,A good book in genereal bu lacking on the midieval side.,"Covers Greek and Romans mainly.The big names are all coveres Alexander the Great, Hannibal,and Julius Caesar. There are many fold out maps. Between the maps and illustrations you really get a good picture of the battle. I think the title is a little misleading because only one chapter deals with all of medieval warfare, 29 pages. If you looking for a book on Greek or Roman warfare this is a good book. For medieval pick look at another."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered two phones to use in a family plan. I recieved the first phone within a week, the second phone is not even delivered yet after 4 weeks.. I know it is not the phones fault, it is amazon..But, the phone is missing some feature that are neccesary, my old samsung phone allowed me to adjust the volume of the phone using the up/down button on the side. This phone i have to go through the sound menu, way to cumbersome and difficult to adjust the volume of the ringer. That is my biggest complaint thus far."
5,Great Phone for Average Daily Usage,"I have da this phone for 2 months now and it works fine. Compared to the Nokia (Cingular) and Motorola i60 (Nextel) I had previously, this phone is a winner. Voice clearity is great unless you are in a bad spot. T-Mobile's network is not is broad as competitor's but in major cities and along Interstates the phone and service are great. The functionality of the phone is also good. People with bigger hands will have trouble operating with one hand due to its size. You can download polyphonic as well as HiFi ringtones that sound very good and are loud. One can assign ringtones to 10 different caller groups which is neat. T-Zones requires some practice and adaptation time to set up alerts and personal settings but it is very helpful.(...)Enjoy!"
2,t-mobile has the worst coverage,"I left Verizon which I now painfully regret. I can not use my cell for any business out of fear of dropping and broken conversations that happen 90% of the time. I had a business trip to New York in which it'd drop every call after a minute. Do not sign up with T-Mobile. I later found out that it's a ""mutt service"" that only borrows time on other towers."
1,"Save your money, buy two cups and a string.","This phone has been a tinny, pooryly made pain-in-the-neck since I got it. The fact that so many people have rated it highly means that either Samsung has a team skewing the ratings or all the ratings are by teen-agers: I can't imagine anyone else could be happy with this thing. It's the worst case of style (and shoddy style at that) over substance that I've ever seen. And I totally agree with the reviewer who complains about the menu and unusable cover display."
1,REFUND PLEASE......................................,"I HATE THIS PHONE! My husband needed a replacement phone. He just had to have a flip phone. OK, he instantly fell in love cause he's a gadget-a-holic.I can't believe as much as this phone was that it's T-R-A-S-H!The battery won't charge unless the telephone is OFF! NOW what if you need to use the phone. The screen is now all BLACK so you can't even read it. SO now I have to purchase another cell for Hubby. He's not even a major talker like his WIFEY so it should have lasted 4 ever!It's a cute phone, but I need something that's more durable for OUR cash flow...."
3,Average phone,"It's really an average phone, and there's nothing to be excited about. It has its own pros and cons, but I doubt that I could put it in the top ten. Somebody mentioned that it can play chess, but, come on, it can only move the pieces!Pros:1. Small2. Light3. Has one international bandCons:1. Buggy: ring+vibration does not work2. No voice dialing3. Annoying pre-set ring tones4. Infrared is not compatible with anything5. Phonebook needs a lot of improvement"
5,Still my favorite book,"Even after all these years, IT is still my favorite book of all time. I have had to buy multiple copies throughout the years due to wear and tear, I am so happy to finally have it on my kindle!"
5,A Classic In My Opinion,"I first read this a long time ago but since I recently bought the Kindle version I'll give my opinion. I was surprised to still be thoroughly entertained by this book. I had to skip some of the details King goes into, like with the town, but the suspenseful scenes kept me clicking to the next page.There was a lot of build up for the final confrontation in the end and it would be hard to satisfy every reader with such buildup. I would say I wasn't fully satisfied but nothing is perfect.Anyways if you haven't read this yet give it a try, especially if you like King."
1,Last King Book I Ever Read,"Ok, there's one thing about Stephen King books that I've always tried to ignore, but this book... [made me way too angry]. This guy really is terrible at writing women. In King's books women are always 1)rescued by the man, 2)protected by the man, 3)whiny and irritating, 4)treated like dirt by the man, 5)of subnormal intelligence. Men always think of women in a condescending way in these books. I'm not a radical feminist, but I'm an independent girl who can defend herself and it annoys me that there are no female characters that I can relate to in any way. This book has one female character whose main purpose is to have sex with the six guys. Come on, Stephen, get with the times."
4,"Scary, but not that scary.","If you've taken the time to read a book over 1,100 pages, you must've liked it otherwise you wouldn't have wasted your time. This book went into a lot of detail about each character's past and present to give the reader the sense that he really knew each one of them. I thought this could've been scaled down some to make the book less of a chore to get through. There was also less a sense of menace about Pennywise than there was about Jack in ""The Shining"" (in my opinion a better book). I never did get totally involved in the terror and thought the ending was a little out there. But all said and done, it was a worthwhile read and second only to ""The Shining"" of King's books."
5,sooooooo,as much as i love this book i was very upset to see that it was currently unavalible and i hae the actual hard cover but its such a pain to carry it around so i was hoping to find it on hereother then that stephen king has a amazing imagination nd i love this book one of my favorates i would recomend reading th book first befor watching the movie so you have a better understading of the story
4,Very good and a must re-read,"I read this book when i was very young. I loved it and read it over and over again. Stephen Kings seems to combine every aspect of good writin in each of his books. You'll always find sex, mystery, death, gore, and stick-to-it-ness in every book.This one, takes the lives of kids in a small Maine town and shows us how strong friendship can/should be. These kids are forced to grow up fast when an evil presence is taking over their town. The think they can stop it. Do they? You'll have to find out, but believe me, you'll love the ride."
4,IT,"This is a book that makes you want to be a kid again! I can remember playing beside a marsh in the woods when I was young and this book brought back all those fun and adventurous memories. But, of course, there wasn't a monster trying to kill me and my friends! This book is extremely long and a very involved read. I don't want to say too much about the story, but I will say this: prepare to cry at the end! Only Stephen King can write a heart felt horror novel! King is a brilliant story teller and an American legend!"
5,Not for the faint-hearted,"Sure, the length of the book at a first glance might be enough to scare you already. And it is complicated. But It is totally worth it. This is a book that needs commitment.So be prepared to devote almost all of your free time into this book. It immerses the reader and is a fascinating treat to the senses (especially for those with an imagination). Chillingly haunted, very wordy, this book is not famous for it's simplicity.But if you're not looking for simple, and you want a terrific scare, pick this up right away. Probably one of King's best."
5,His Best,"""It"" is greater than everything else that he has done combined. How could he keep up that intensity for more than thousand pages?"
3,book size,"Make sure you look at the size of the book before you buy & know this is what you want. This book is the size of a paperback and the font is VERY small. I got it for my nephew who can read small font, but if this was for my elderly eyes it would have been sent back!"
4,"Crazy, creepy King epic!!","Stephen King has this was of making a unrealistically huge novel seem small. I read this pretty quickly as King brought me into the terrifying town of Derry, Maine. The main characters were all so clearly defined that I could tell who was speaking without even being told. The style King used here was at times grating with its denseness but that can easily be overlooked by the overall sense of dread and creepiness these seven kids then adults live through. The ending was at times a little too trippy and weirder than normal King but overall this mammoth novel is worth every penny. Don't be afraid of the size of it. Great stuff."
5,A Shite Kicking Great Story,"Most folks wanna right these long drawn out reviews of their favorite books of all time. All I wanna say is, ""This is one of The Most Shite kicking story's of all time"". Love ya Mr. King...You are Super Awesome. D"
5,Send in the Clowns,"Mr. King has again scared me so much I absolute LOVE it - but I will forever be afraid of clowns and storm drains. I felt as if I knew all of the characters personally as I do with all his books. Triumph of good over evil, as with a lot of his books, this one is very special. Pennywise is a very worthy advisary and perfect evil."
5,spooky stuff,"and Im not clowning around.Neather is pennywise the clown.I love Bill Denbrough and his six friends who back in the mid 50s inbark on quest in there small town to rid the place of evil.These characters were so real to me that I felt like they were my friend.I felt like the town Derry was my home town.If your a horror fan pleas,pleas read this"
5,Great horror - do not read before bed-time!!,"The first part of the book is boring, but since page 400 ( in the hebrew version), it's become very interesting the scerry. One of mr. King's best books, if not the best."
5,The best horror book ever!,"this thing is an opus, man. Unlike a lot of wimps out there, I'm not afraid of a whole lot of pages. I feel jipped if it's under three hundred. At the same time, I hate when I get a meaty thousand page book and it's full of hot air, like those Robert Jordan books. This book filled my every requirement. Nice and long, and chock full of story. It wasn't even the horror that made me love it so damn much. It was the kids he created and the adults they turned into. I wish I could remember my childhood the way King obviously remembers his, but I still recognized the thoughts and games those kids played. And that last line killed me. About how in the early dawn he almost remembers his childhood and the kids he shared it with. I feel the same way. Sometimes when I'm half asleep I almost remember and then it slips away. That last line almost made me, a grown man (and then some), cry. Man, this was a good book."
5,You'll fly!,"IT is my favourite book right now. I'll read other books but I don't think that the following novels will top this book. I like when the LOSERS were children because it lets you remember your own childness. If you read this novel, you will probably laugh, scream and cry. When you'll have been finished reading this fantastic novel you'll think that life is beautiful!"
5,My Review for IT,I havent finished yet but I am loving this book.Any Stephen King fan I highly recommend it!It is phenominal!I love this book!
2,IT,"The book Stephen Kings IT is an ok book. Because it is scary book and it begins to be scary when ""Georgie was being pulled toward that terrible darkness where the water rushed and roared and bellowed as it bore its cargo of storm debris toward the sea."" Also it goes into detail and talks about how the people die and its pretty graohic. The book can be confusing at times cause it would sometimes jump from scene to scene and sometimes the reader wouldn't even know what was happening for example it went from a tradgic death to an event that happened later and it didnt even minchen what happened so the reader would get lost. The book could be suspenseful at times especilly when the reader knew somthing was about to happen and the character didn't and it was like you wanted to tell them but you couldn't thats how its supenseful otherwise the book was ok."
3,Not King's Best,"Tommyknockers, The Stand, and King's later novels all maintain an internal consistency. They may be bizarre, they may be shocking, but at least they make sense within the framework of the story. This novel, which introduces some intriguing and well-developed characters and has a complex, interesting structure, falls apart toward the end. The destruction of Derry in the final flood is gratuitious and unnecessary. One of the few King novels I wouldn't rate at least a 4."
5,Fantastic,Just finished reading this book and I loved it. One of my favorite Stephen King books by far. The level of detail is awesome and it was easy to become emotionally involved with the characters. Will read again!
5,Stephen King's IT,"A masterfully entwined novel of horror and coming-of-age that, until the end, is a masterpiece. What happens at the end? Without giving away anything, let me just say that there is EXTREMELY underage intercourse (11 year olds) told very graphically. I'm not saying it didn't make sense, but it didn't NEED to be there. Other than that, IT is an incredible book. I recommend it very highly"
5,His best since Dark Half.,"It is a magnificent book interwining the lives of 7 people so deeply that they couldn't even comprehend it.You fly through the +1000 pages faster than you could imagine and by the end, you feel as though the characters were so known to you that you could pick them out in New York city.The most incredible character development I have ever read.No other book has captivated me.I would rate this book right on par with his earlier Daek Half and that is not something easily acheived.For those of you who loved this book, give The Dark Half a go. It is great too."
5,Uncle Stephen is the best!!!!!,"There were times when I just wanted to stop reading It. It was so scary, and magical, and real, and wonderful... that I said to myself ""No. It can't be happening. it's an illusion..."" It was bad to stop reading it. I felt like life would stop... like ""The show must go on"" If you wanna try one of SK books, try this one, and you'll never feel disappointed."
4,UNKLE,"Not as compelling as Fiction or Never Land, but great nonetheless. My only complaint is the lack of ""original"" content on the disc - most is remixed from the previous albums. But beyond that, a must have for any UNKLE fan."
3,Showing off,"Even while coming across as a bit of a washed out variety show, Hackett still shows how his sloppy seconds often outweigh worshipful neo-prog descendants."
1,not good enough,"This is a typical straight love story that can be seen in any other movieor tv program, don't know why you have it in your gay movies section, went ahead and ordered and I didn't find anything gay on it and the movie is not even worth the price that I paid for it. Skip it."
4,worth a watch,"I enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and I'm glad that I was able to find a copy to purchase. When it first aired, I admit I was skeptical, but as the movie progressed I became intrigued. The twist in this movie wasn't what I would've expected and it was rather interesting as to how the characters grew due to the accident and were fleshed out in a way that they weren't two dimensional sterotypes like several romantic movies are. Check it out."
5,Stylish Device with Crisp Sound,"I bought this radio for my father for Christmas and he LOVED its design as soon as he opened it. We got the black version and we both found it to be very attractive. When I got it, I thought it seemed somewhat small and was unsure of what the sound quality would be like-- but I was DEFINITELY WRONG. We plugged that thing in and were amazed at how many radio stations we could pick up. The volume was excellent and we were impressed how the quality remained as we turned it up louder and louder. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking about purchasing!"
3,theres no iphone dock. you have to connect yours with a wire.,"someone complained about their iphone not fitting in the dock below. i just wanted to clarify, this model is not the iphone dock. please click if you find this info useful. b/c i found this by searching for retro iphone dock."
2,Disappointing,"I wish I was happy with this radio. It looks great, has a small footprint, and the dials have a firm feel. The power converter must have been changed since the period in which complaints were posted about its size. Ours is fairly modest as those things go.It's just puzzling that there are so many accolades for the sound quality. It's not bad for music, but news programs sound like they are coming from the bottom of a wash tub. Why there is no tone adjustment is beyond me.Why, with the availability of so many cheap clock radios, is it so hard to find a good-sounding, inexpensive, stand-alone radio?"
4,simple and straightforward table radio,"This is a simple, straightforward table radio. I live in a sometimes difficult reception area and this unit will usually pick up small stations I'm after."
5,Croseley Solo Radio,"Great product and price. Nicely packed. Exceeded expectations. Very compact and very stylish. (Crosley Solo Radio Cr221, Black.) Excellent sound. Well constructed."
4,satisfied,"I was looking for a specific photo, taken by Linda McCartney. I goggled it and was taken right to the book. It was affordable and it came quickly in the mail."
2,A TOTAL SUCKFEST,"I expected a lot from the Bad Livers, but only got BAD.Total un-fun listen.Posers pretending to be from the 30s and 40s.Too Bad."
1,Skip this one,"Belongs on everyone's ""worst movies I have ever seen"" list. The color is terrible and the transfer is very bad.Making Armin Mueller-Stahl the love interest of Morgan Fairchild is casting insanity. He could easily be her grandfather so a good bit is lost trying to accept that twosome.The movie itself is hard to grasp because the police station looks like a garage with busted toilets sitting in the hallways. Nothing is real about the movie plus it would appear the cameraman had no grasp of light versus dark. At times, you can't even recognize where a scene is taking place because of the darkness.Save your money and don't buy this DVD. This is below a grade B movie...If there is a ""C"" movie or a ""D"" this would certainly qualify."
3,Leche sin carne,This is a good album it has the same feel as Leche con carne but the songs are just a little less memorbale but its still pretty good. I would get that album first. Invincible and the answer is still no are awesome to start off the album.
2,design change,"My husband has a manduka and it is slip proof. His is the ""black mat"", tho the desgn on the top is squiggles - and this one and the new ""black mat"" (it actually does come in different colors now) have grids. If you can find one with the squiggles, snatch it up, cuz this one stinks. It compares to the one I got at Target for $10.99. I slide around on it like its a skating rink. The website says: rub it with sea salt, clean it with vinegar - (I want to exercise, not prepare a gourmet meal!) and after daily use for 3-4 months it will not be slipperey anymore. While I would love to use daily, here in reality, Im lucky to get to yoga 3 times a week. So 7-8 months of stepping up from down dog becasue my toes slip too much to hop? Ugh. Find a different brand, and if it works for you, let me know! The reason it got 2 stars instead of one is because it is a dense mat, and even on hardwood is comfortable for your knees. Not good for yoga, but maybe fine for floor exercise."
3,my hands still slip,"After reading many, many reviews on this mat and the jade harmony, I settled on this one. My hands still slip. And even worse, on this mat, my feet slip when in warrior 2, so I have to shorten my stance. The last mat I bought was also slippery, so I returned that one. I spent a lot of money on this one and feel like I have to get my money's worth before I buy another one."
1,Manduka Prolite Mat Not 24 inches wide,The first time I used the Prolite it felt narrow. I was used to a mat that is 24 inches wide. The Prolite is advertised as 24 inches wide but I measured it after I got home and it is only 23-5/8 inches wide. Although only a small difference but it made a big difference in how I felt using it.
2,One slick mat,"My wife bought this mat and she thinks it is too slippery. Her yoga instructor told her to wash it to give it more traction. She has washed it twice, scrubbing it vigorously with a brush, and it is still slippery. Maybe we can use it as a sled."
5,Don't Give Up So Easily,"This mat is great. My advice for all yogis that can't keep their hands from slipping during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative. Rather than throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet. First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser. Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry. This should help. Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda. Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes. I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that. With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat."
5,"great mat...still heavier than the average, but better than the pro","This mat is great! The only downside to it for me is the weight. Although this mat is MUCH lighter than the Black Mat (which, though wonderful, is too large to be practical and too heavy to bring anywhere), it is still much heavier than the agoy eco mats that I am used to. Love it...not in purple, blue is best.! namaste"
2,Waste of money,"I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment. For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed. Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT."
2,DVD has ALTERED FILM'S SPEED!,"VIDEO ASIA'S DVD transfer of INVINCIBLE ARMOR has an altered film speed. It looks like some silent film transfers do with an unnatural slowing down of motion, comparable to the effect a strobe light has on the dance floor. This is a shame as INVINCIBLE ARMOR is a great film with great fights. Unfortunately, it is during the fight scenes that this speed delay is most noticeable (and distracting). The original print of this film ran at normal speed (I've seen it on VHS) and this alteration is UNEXCEPTABLE. While the DVD is widescreen and for the most part has a very crisp picture (something I cannot say is true of VIDEOASIA's recent DVD transfer of CRANE FIGHTER which is fullscreen and blurry even though the box states it's widescreed), I cannot recommend this version of the film. Sorry, but INVINCIBLE ARMOR deserves better."
5,DK China,This DK travel guide - like all of DK publications - is an excellent source of travel information on China. We always look for a DK guide when visiting a new city or country.
1,last version worked better,"I am on my second one of these. The first one I bought maybe 5 years ago finally wore out and was looking rather shabby, so I purchased a new one last year. They changed a few features on it and now it doesn't work at all. The little perches the birds stand on unscrew no matter how tightly I screw them in and fall out after a few days. I tried glueing them in, but that failed. I kept screwing them back in but over the weeks I have had it I am down to about 2 of them. I think they got swept up with leaves--or some animal ran off with them... have no idea, but they vannished. Anyhow I won't be buying another of this type. I wish I could get the one that was made before this version. It worked fine."
4,Almsot Swuirrel Proof,Only the cleverest of squirrels can find a way into this feeder and only once in a while. Even this very clever fellow can't get there every time he tries. When he does succeed he has to hang upside down suspended by his hind feet to eat. It hardly seems worth the effort when the woods are full of acorns. It has been most amusing to watch the little gray vandals try every which way from Sunday to get into this feeder and fail miserably!
4,Works but food can drop to the ground,"The birds really love this feeder, and the squirrels have given up trying to attack it. Now the squirrels just wait on the ground and eat what the sloppy chickadees drop. I originally put in a mix with mostly millet, but the birds didn't come that often; I switched to sunflower and now the birds empty the feeder in one week. This feeder has no tray for dropped food, so I put a container on the ground to catch some of it. It would be nicer if there was a way to catch the food before it drops to the ground."
4,Squirrel Buster Plus Cardinal Rings Don't Last,"Overall, I find the Squirrel Buster Plus to be an effective (almost foolproof) deterent to pesky squirrels. You can set it to keep heavier birds off the feeder, thus attracting more Cardinals, Titmouse, Finches, etc. The biggest problem is the Cardinal ring. It's made out of a hard plastic, but simply doesn't last. The ring broke in two places in less than one month of ownership. The company is great to deal with, but the rings should have been made out of steel or aluminum. Never underestimate the tenacity of a committed squirrel on the prowl for a snack. My feeder is no where near an overhanging tree branch and is suspended from a shepherd's pole off of a 16 ft. high deck. A few (very few) squirrels have figured out how to hang upside down and nimbly munch at the feeder openings. I hope this Canadian based firm will make note of complaints and replace plastic with metal. It will cure a great many issues."
5,Fantastic feeders!!!!!!!!!,"We have literally spent years experimenting with different feeders to slow down the squirrels and encourage the birds. And, finally we have a solution that works like a dream. The Brome 1024 and Brome 1015 are fantastic and the squirrels, except for an occasional holdout, have given up trying. And thus we are able to buy our feathered friends more interesting feed. Plus, since we still want to enjoy our little pesky squirrels we have found that the Perky-Pet Squirrel Stumper does the job if you only fill it with sunflower seeds and put a wire across the top cover so they can't work it off. After years of squirrels chewing through feeders and taking the tops or bottoms off it is such a delight to have an honest to goodness solution."
5,Great feeder!,"I have had this feeder for a little over a week now. I love it! Previously I had the Yankee Flipper from Droll Yankees. I had some problems with it, the motor quit working, and the squirrels would empty it (5# of seed!!) in a little over a day. AND I have about 6 other feeders in my yard! This feeder only seems to have to be filled every 3 to 5 days. I have seen Cardinals feeding from it, which they would not do with my Flipper. (I'm not knocking Droll Yankees, I have several other feeders of theirs and they are a good product overall). I am enjoying this so much, I might purchase a second one. It's very sturdy too, which is very necessary."
3,Squirrel proof feeder,"This product works very well for keeping the food away from the squirrels. And the birds like it also. We use it for sunflower seeds. However, there is no 'tray' to catch the spillage. There is a huge amount of intact sunflower seeds on the ground. Many birds do feed from the ground (as well as the squirrels). We decided not to use it any more as we were going through far more seed than the squirrels could ever eat."
3,"Good feeder, squirrel proof-but not deer proof!","Had one of these for a few years and it workd well. Mounted on a pole since do not want bird droppings all over the house. Well, guess what, squirrels can't get in but the deers will empty it over night!. Motion light detector reveals them feeding away. Whereas the deer do not go near the less expensive version of the bird feeder made by this company. Device needs some research to make it deer proof!"
4,Pretty good feeder,"It definitely keeps the squirrels out!!! They tried the first few times and they gave up since the spring loaded feeder dropped, closing off the feeder holes. I'm enjoying my feeder with very beauitful, colorful birds. I hope it does the same for you."
4,Feeder Bought on Amazon,"I think the feeder would work very well with squirrels. Unfortunately, we live in the country where raccoons are in abundance. All they managed to do was tear off the ring for the birds to sit on, so I have to try to remember to take it in before dark when the ""critters"" come out to eat."
5,well designed and constructed,"Of course squirrels can't feed from it; that's it's design, and water doesn't leak into it either. Easy to clean as well. The problem is that it is not night-time marauding black bear proof. What bears do is tear it down and take it off into the woods to crack open its plastic barrel at leisure. If one finds it--not easy to do--you discover that it's metal parts stand up nicely, however. So, this means re-buying the darned thing and learning that it needs to be taken in at night. Anyway, birds seem to love it; Cardinals too. Doves and small birds congregate underneath it to feed. Sometimes even large crows come to clean up the ground. It holds a large amount of food, too, which is another reason bears seem to like it."
5,Wish I had bought it sooner,Seems well made and it works. I guess the squirrels tried it and gave up . I have yet to see one even attempt to get seeds out. It will pay for itself in just a few months. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of feeding squirrels instead of birds.
4,The squirrels are finally stymied!,"The blackbirds on the other hand have figured this thing out.The previous ""squirrel proof"" bird feeder that we had offered daily proof that it could feed squirrels up to and including the varmints actually climbing inside of the thing. The squirrels don't even try with this one. They hang around underneath and clean up what falls.Blackbirds and Jays can on the other hand feed on this unit if they do so one at a time. Who would have thought they could learn to be so polite?Nonetheless the feeder works great overall."
3,Not a squirrel buster,"Quality is definitely good, but squirrels are way smarter than the creator of this product gives them credit for. The squirrels just hang upside down on the feeder body without stepping on the perch ring and able to feed just fine. They finished more than half the feeder in less than 4 days."
3,Beware of raccoons,"This is a good feeder and works as described. However, I have a real problem with raccoons at night and have to take this feeder down at dusk. I have found it dismantled and carried halfway across the yard if I forget. It isn't ""varmint proof"", but I doubt anything really is. At least it defeated the deer and squirrel problem."
4,Pretty good feeder,"This feeder stymied the squirrels pretty well. At first they tried it, and I had to reset the factory settings for the weight required for it to close completely. I guess our squirrels here aren't as large as other places. After that when they say they couldn't get at the seed, they tried to chew their way in (which they were able to do on my previous plastic feeders). That didn't work, but they did manage to chew off the paint around the holes in the base so it looks well-used now. I wonder if that part is replaceable under the squirrel-damage warranty. So far, it's been a hit with the birds, but not the squirrels."
5,The Best Bird Feeder,"After fighting for several months with the squirrels over my old ""squirrel-proof"" bird feeder, I decided to take more drastic action. I purchased this one after reading all the reviews. I have had it a month and so far the squirrels have not gotten any seed out of the feeder.They have tried, and tried, and tried. I think they have finally given up and now just eat the seeds that fall on the ground.I have more birds than ever, even cardinals! They love it.This was well worth the money!"
2,Second One,Initially I was pleased as it rid me of the grackles. However taking this apart and then reassembling after cleaning became a dubious chore. Alas finally getting it all back together the lever controls for the individual feed stations seem to no longer function. I give up!
3,no cardinals,"I have a Brome squirrel feeder but the cardinals can't use it. I bought this one to specifically accommodate that bird. I works fine for keeping the squirrels off, as does the other one, - but the cardinals still don't use it. My friendly woodpecker uses the other one and knocks down seeds which the cardinals eat off the ground. Disappointed."
1,Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster,I putchased two of these with high hopes that they would deter our starlings and squirrels. This has been accomplished but the birds birdcot this feeder.After one try all of the cardinals totally ignore this. The Mocking Birds will take a few nibbles if nothing else is available. I filled one with sunflower seeds and I do not see any signs of these being eaten. The fruit and nut mix I use does disappear but at a very very slow rate. Mostly the small birds will partake. The cost was high and so was the disappointment
2,Damaged Product,When I received the bird feeder the outside package was fine it was packed nicely and boxed When I took out of the original box it has a large dent on the base (bottom of feeder). Which is strange because the box had not damage.This is why i do not like to order things online because I don't like the return process.
4,Cardinal Ring should be something other than plastic,"It's true that this bird feeder is squirrel proof - meaning they can't get at the seeds, if hung as described. However, if squirrels get on the feeder, they will chew through the plastic cardinal ring - I have already lost two rings like that. Cardinals will not light on this feeder if there is no ring, as they do not like to eat ""sideways"". As expensive as this feeder is, you would think that they would have something a little more sturdy for the perch. The squirrels have also chewed the metal roof (actually bent it) and the holes around the feeding ports, and have chewed a lot of the green paint off."
2,Might work if nothing near it,"I bought one of these and it's useless for me since squirrels can reach it from the side. The manual warns you about this, but the descriptions (and worse the dealers) don't.The squirrels quickly figure out that they can lean on it gently and raid it from the side. They strip the seed pretty fast that way.Don't buy unless you've got a few feet clearance on all sides."
5,Squirrel Buster feeder works,"So far, the squirrels haven't figured out how to get the seed from the Brome 1024. I watched them crawl down the chain but they slip off and fall on the ground. I think they have given up. Victory!I've had a little trouble getting the tension right so a variety of birds can feed. The directions aren't too good for this part.Overall, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this feeder."
5,it really works,"I tried others.... they were NOT squirrel proof at all. THIS ONE WORKS!! It's well made, looks good, and works as advertised. Don't buy the ""other"" brand."
4,BIrds love it,"I haven't got a chance to see any squirrels make an attempt at the seed yet. The local birds seem to like it a lot though, mostly getting chickadees and nuthatches right now. It was easy to put together and seems pretty sturdy. We hung it off the side of our deck from aMetal Deck Hookand it works just fine."
4,Had to add a dome to really make it squirrel-proof,I've had this feeder for at least five years and it's held up well. I did have to add a dome over the top of the feeder because the squirrels figured out how to lift the top enough to squeeze into the tube. The dome effectively ended their party.
5,Excellent Bird Feeder,This feeder allows you to choose the size of the bird that you want to feed. The spring has a wide range of settings. You don't have to refill it often because it holds a generous amount of seed.
5,It Works!,"After years of having the squirrels eating an entire bird feeder's contents in a single day, thereby leaving all the birds to starve, I finally found this feeder. Now everyone's happy. The birds are in my yard in great numbers, all sizes and varieties, eating to their heart's content. The squirrels still get seeds because the birds knock some to the ground.The feeder is easy to use, easy to hang up. I had to position it so the squirrels don't hang onto something near by, like a branch, in order to reach the food by avoiding using the spring loaded perch. Every once in a while I put out my old feeder, now dubbed the squirrel feeder, to give those tree rats a treat!I am very pleased with this squirrel buster plus with cardinal perch. BTW- I've actually had cardinals feeding there."
1,Waited long enough,"We have used Get serious for a while now and it's great. The problem here is we have a new puppy and cant wait until she grows up to receive it. The price may be better than a reputable dealer, but not if you cant get it in a reasonable amount of time....Wont make that mistake again."
1,Roy - author of boring things,"With her lofty poetic literary style, her abstract new-age-Indian story telling ability, her strange and pointless social observations, and her annoying multitudes of excessively dysfunctional characters, Roy makes me go beddy-bye."
1,"Author is CONFUSED,falls in category I am not OK-You are OK","This book is an excellent example of those people who have inferiority complex. They want to please some people or audience who they feel are superior to them.This confused book was written with an objective to please the west. Please, please, please don't do it again."
2,Boring excepting at the end,"Roy is naive, but she has passion. Makes an unusual combination but that cannot rescue the book."
4,"Beautifully Haunting, Hauntingly Beautiful","The book is impressive in the number of stories it unfolds, the range of their indepth tales.The book will be a difficult read to someone not raised in India. The advertisements, the products, the Mahabharata, the viciousness of caste-based politics, etc will not register in a foreigner's mind so easily.It will be a difficult read for paperback readers who need sequence and explicit clarity. This book revolves around real people of a fictional realm. And they haunt its pages randomly. Without care for sequential unfolding of their life's drama.Every character is elaborated upon, discovered and illustrated. The story is at times desiring reader's effort and patience. Take in the story as it comes without fighting its unique layout and you would enjoy reading it. Not a must-read. But recommended. Not an ""untouchable"" book. But deeply touching."
1,It shows that the book is by a novice,"The story is confusing, the characters come and go, and there is a surrealistic quality about the writing. Has some nice passages that recall life in Kerala, its steamy quality, and the complex social relationships. But the book does not go above the surface stories. Good first effort by a promising writer."
1,"The book gave me chest pains (I""m serious)",********* WARNING **************Steer Clear of This BookI had the misfortune of reading this book a few months back and I must say that I believe this book had so much wasted potential. A story must be told of 'love across the castes' in India - but this isn't it. From the meandering writing style to the irritating characters there isn't much here to enjoy. The only character I liked was Baby Kochamma (although I wouldn't in real life) because she kept giving all the other characters such a hard time. Oh to be Baby Kochamma.....
1,Highly overrated,"Why do so many undeserving books make it to the bestseller lists? The God of Small Things pales in comparison to beautifully written books by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Kiran Desai, etc. I was greatly disappointed."
4,Substance stumbling over style,"Let's be clear about one thing. I liked the book, so much in fact, that I am re-reading it. That however may not a great book make. What really attracted me was how Roy is able to get under the skin of a child - physically two, they do share a monozygotic soul - and explain what the world looks like. In fact the whole book seems to view the world from a child's eyes - not so much as the events in themselves, but rather the way a human reacts to events. In many places I was really amazed by this, because the book told me how I would've reacted as a child (but had lost the senstivity as an adult). That said, I think the language needs some polishing. Maybe she should've revised it. Deadwoods like the twins feelings for their mother's beauty are aplenty. And who says all Indians write like Rushdie? This book really proves otherwise because it's the emotions and not the events that bind the tale together."
1,None of the characters are likable,"The characters are all scummy, and nothing but miserable things fill their lives. The only ""good"" character in the book is the half-English girl, who dies."
3,An overhyped work.,"One wonders what all the hoopla was about. I consider myself a very tolerant reader, but this really tested my patience. Indeed, it is with very great difficulty that I finished the book. At best, it is a commendable first effort,certainly not a masterpiece. There is something to be said for the language, which is richly evocative, the similies and metaphors startlingly accurate. But Ms Roy simply overdoes this, so that the language becomes irritating after a while. The characters, I felt, were poorly drawn; they do not linger in the mind nor do they engender the sort of wistfullness that one finds in trully great works. It is also obviously a made-for-western-eyes work; it panders to western ideas of the exotic East rather than forcing western readers to approach India on her own terms. The novel therefore appears artificial. Despite all this,it is obvious that Ms Roy has a lot of talent, and her next novel - if there is going to be one - can only get better."
4,"A Great, Vividly Told Journey","Not being very familiar with Indian culture, I was initially a little slow at getting into this story. However, once I was in, I was IN! This book is wonderfully written and emotionally evocative. The characters are very developed, and the book is lyrically haunting and told with such honesty of feeling. I urge everyone to read it! I especially enjoyed learning more about India."
2,Let us reinvent the wheel and patent it!,The book was upsetting for the crass commerialization of the issues that sell only too well! Interweaving of the issues with twin psyches was great; but the description of issues was crass if not totally vulgar! I have yet to see an author come up with a storyline that would suggest answers to the issues raised by this book: issues which have been raised only one too many times.
2,Roy tries too hard,"The book has some interesting character analyses esp of the children. But the overwhelming letdown was the prose and her style of writing. It is obvious she tries too hard to be different, which gets rather tiring. I had the feeling of being led round and round and ending up nowhere significant."
2,audio book is confusing,"too many names introduced, too much criss-crossing of timelines with no pausing or explanation...not to mention dull. Abridged version (6 hours) needs to be further abridged to 3 hours."
3,"There is a story there, if you can find it.","It wasn't the worst book I have read, but I found myself skimming through paragraphs at a time to get through her wordiness to the story.If you enjoy heavily worded phrases and endless metaphors, this is the book for you."
2,lost optimism,"The novel is about a pair of fraternal twins who have been separated for 23 years and have to take down all their barriers to restore their bond emotionally. The reading level is high and uses difficult and flowery words. Also the story is difficult to follow because of the way the author goes back and forth in time so freely not giving much background to the story until the very end. The book is also for more mature readers because of the vivid account of a boy being sexually assaulted, the abuse of many wives, and the incest that goes on in the story. The plot is overall uneventful because of the way the book manoeuvres from memories to present, once you figure out that the story takes place in one day you find the story not fulfilling and has no point. The ending also (because the fate of the characters is also given to us) should have been more optimistic, giving light for a better future, instead the readers already know what happens to the characters so the optimism is lost."
2,This could have been a great book.,"This could have been a great book. However, it's only a mediocre one. I found Roy's word play springing not so much creativity, but from laziness--especially as she uses the same phrases over and over again. In addition, Roy seemed to take great joy in muddling the timeline. She would go back a forth a day, a few days, a week, a month, and years. Even at the end of the book, I was still slightly confused as to what happened when. HOWEVER, the final chapter was beautifully written and seemed to be almost the work of a different author. This writer was mature, disciplined and willing to open her soul and expose the love and pain within. As a result, this one chapter was much closer to poetry than anything offered in the previous twenty. As I see it, poetry is more a state of mind than a state of words. If Roy can continue to write as she did in the last chapter of The God of Small Things, she will be a great writer."
2,Too much cutting and pasting,"Like The Celestine Prophecy, here is a trendy bestseller everyone is trying too hard to love. And like The Celestine Prophecy, it just isn't very well written. Ms. Roy shows some definite potential when she just lets her story flow and the characters talk naturally, but too much of the time the prose is cut into bite-size portions that digest way too easily. It sounds like a bad poem written by a nihilistic teenager. The characters get far too annoying too, with Ms. Roy cramming them so full of quirks that you get sick of it. The God of Small Things is occasionally poetic but more often than not ridiculous, contrived, and boring."
5,A modern day classic,"I cannot wait to reread this book that I had read when it was first published in the early nineties. As I recall, its poetic prose and moving story line are breath taking and troubling, all at once. It's a haunting story that stays with you leaving behind compassion and understanding for those who've suffered great sorrows. A must read!"
5,Spellbinding,"This was an incredibly spellbinding story that I remember fondly years after having read it. I marvel at the way the writer turned a series of horrible tragedies and dysfunctions into a beautiful tale that was a pleasure to read. The detail is amazing. For instance, the rainy season is described as when the pages of the books expand with the humidity. The author definitely has a gift for description."
2,Flavor of the Month,"Despite its powerful, playful use of language, ""The God of Small Things"" was a disappointment. After evoking a certain time and place -- Southern India in the 1960's -- throughout the book, Roy crash-lands into the worst conventions of 1990's creative writing programs. Did the world really need another incest story? I certainly didn't."
4,Quality of writing outweighs weird end,"The language and dialogue of this book is beautiful. The metaphors are wonderful. I loved reading this book--up until the broken the ""love laws."" At first, I thought I hated what happened. But now (a day or two later), I feel manipulated. I'm going to reread and let the quality of the writing outweigh the weird end (which it does)."
4,At a crossroads of talent,"Roy leaves mouths agape; domino structure of language that she forges throughout the work speaks words of volumes to what it means to create. The literary paint thinner to get to the primer of the matter, The God of Small Things is behemoth in execution, rolled to knock the pins from the very structures that we thought, in modernity, cannot possibly exist. Roy opens our eyes to reveal that iniquity exists in the actions of both men and their systems of order and the light that she shows us is nothing less than brilliant."
1,My First Amazon Problem Ever,"Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this item. I remain anxious, as I look forward to receiving and reading it. I am familiar with the writings of this author and expect that I will continue to respect her logic and writing abilities."
3,Beautifullly drawn landscape but ugly side of life grates.,"I am halfway through this highly praised work and cannot help thinking that underneath the enormous talent of Ms Roy there is a fractured and angry soul revulsed by human wickedness.(I understand that the novel is largely based on personal experience).Some situations in the book are brilliantly evoked-like the march of the communist party members-but the underlying narrative remains determined to expose human ugliness and frailty.The writer excels in being dirty with the dirty.This is the modern way.But even the most sophisticated amongst us need to dream and none of her characters allow us to do that.Despite the inventive language and the myriad ploys used in recalling the story,the book essentially fails to filter memories."
2,much ado about nothing,I dont understand why folks in india made such a big deal about this book. I think that is why many of us read it here becoz there was so much publicity given to it. I found it hard to remember the names of the characters and consequently did not know who was who while i read the book. pb
1,Disappointing!,So disappointed in Roy's first book. What exactly was the point? -- did she actually think describing in detail the horrendous conditions in India would hold our interest throughout the book. Set the scene but get on with it.
5,Beautiful,"By far the most fluid, thick, and beautiful book I have ever read. It takes a chapter or two to understand what Roy is saying, but once you start to get it you never want to leave. It is the most joyous of sorrows, and the most georgous of filths. Not to be taken with a narrow mind, it is about the small things in life. The little beauties. If you get it, you will love it, and if you don't love it, then you don't get it."
2,"Overpriced, Overhyped and Over the Top","William Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha, Thomas Hardy and Wessex, R.K.Narayan and Malgudi... and now, Roy and her Ayemenem. The difference is that Ayemenem actually exists, though its natives prefer to spell it slightly differently. The quaint little town, the stereotyped characters, the prose that is a shade too purple, all seem a calculated attempt at taking ethnic chic to the masses (in this case, eager foreigners). Of course, the book is successful. If clever wordplay and a minimal understanding of the social milieu can contribute to the making of a truly great novel, this has to be it. However, it seems to be a one-off effort and it is doubtful whether Roy can repeat her success."
2,A Colossal Disappointment,"As a PhD student of literature and a lover of Indian literature in particular, I was very excited to finally find time to peruse this novel. While I understand that this book is critically acclaimed, I was extremely disappointed and actually dropped the book at page 270. Simply put, what could have been a great story gets lost in the author's attempt at fancy poesy and artfulness. Roy is about as far from straight forward as one can get. I kept hoping that if I continued to read on, I would hit pay dirt, but it never happened. The story gets lost under a mound of fanciful junk. I have only put down a handful of books in my lifetime without finishing them, and when I have, it was because the attempt to finish became futile because the interest simply ceased to exist.If you want to read a great book about Indian life, choose anything by Rohinton Mistry...you won't be disappointed. Thrity Umrigar and Padma Viswanathan are also noteworthy."
5,Wonderful Book,Read it when your soul is quiet. Pick this book up when your life isn't too tumultous or else you will miss some of the gentle and nuanced pleasures of this book. Enjoy it.
2,"beautiful use of language, just too much of it","I love a good simile and metaphor as much as the next person, but this was a serious case of what my writing class teacher used to call ""over egging the pudding""; too much richness makes you nauseous, like a small child eating too many sweets at a birthday party. There! I'm doing it myself! I think the word ""like"" must be the commonest word in this book. Each individual simile or metaphor was breathtaking and original (mostly.. some were totally out of place like ""silence climbing the bathroom walls like Spiderwoman"") but together it was all just too much and slowed down the pace of the story. This author would be better occupied as a poet. There she can give full expression to as many metaphors and similes as she likes. They are way overdone in this self indulgent work. I can't even comment on the core story because it was obscured by the language used to tell it."
1,Very average and is universal.,The book talks of a particular community. The problem is that similar situations occur in all societies. It is an expanded version of the book by Ms. Mathai on marriages which describes of how a mother attempts to arrange a marriage match. So don't get too excited by the book under discussion.
1,Is it over yet?,"After reading so many wonderful reviews of this book, I thought I had to read it. The book started out slowly and it was really fractured in the sense that it jumped to the present then to the past, then to something completely unrelated to the plot at that time. I thought it was a quirky way to present the story but went along with it because I expected it to turn into this amazing story that I heard so many reviews say it was. I tried, but never got there. After reading almost halfway through the book, I simply couldn't take it anymore. It was so incredibly boring, confusing, and filled with events that weren't even connected in any way that I couldn't take it anymore. I gave up. There's only been a handful of books I could not read from beginning to end, and this is one of them. I gave it a chance to grow and see the characters develop, thrive, etc, but it never happened. I wish I could have my time back so I could have spent it on more worthy books."
1,a battle to read,I feel as if I've lost a battle when I can't finish a book but this one I put down after 2/3rds of the way through. I had little empathy for any of the characters and felt removed from scenes as if I was watching from a dark hallway...one filled with filth and obnoxious smells. A number of reviewers commented on Roy's magical style of writing...so what if it doesn't get to the point.Read Lahiri instead.
1,What's the big deal with this book ?,"I must say, I can't understand the hype about this book. Boy, Was I disappointed. Big time. The book just never did hook me into wanting to finish it. I couldn't care less about the characters."
3,India as you did not know it,"I wanted to like this book because it has such good reviews but it was irritatingly repetitive and kept teasing you with the climax for the entire book so that when it occurred at the end I felt let down. I had to keep forcing myself to read it and had to keep skimming the repetitions so I didn't go crazy. I felt like the author had decided that all the clever language she had worked out was so amazing that she had to keep slapping you in the face with it and endlessly repeating it. Basically the characters were well developed, the story, sad but valuable and the setting was new and different to any I have read before."
4,Wordy but compelling,"This may a book you either love or hate simply based on its style. The main story itself is simple yet compelling; Shakespearian in its basic elements of archetypal characters trying to create and define themselves in a world that has already made its own plans for everyone. But each character has their own backstory that all informs the main plot and climax. ""The devil is in the details"" definitely holds true for this novel - either you enjoy Roy's endless metaphors, both for simple imagery and for the overarching themes, or you don't. Her prose is beautiful but sometimes gets in the way of simply telling the story. If you can get past the first chapter though, then the rest of the book should be enjoyable and evocative, and will probably make you want to read it again right away."
5,One of my favorite books,"This book is so entertaining and though you might be confused in the first chapter once you are done you will understand and realize how sad and beautiful this book is. It all becomes a great re-read. You will love Velutha, the Untouchable and the kids' innocence. Roy portrays love as an element that cannot be stopped by or should not be stopped because of the Indian caste-system."
5,Well done - Roy!,"If you are a junkie who like the types of John Grisham et al, probably you will not like this book at all. Splendid. Reminiscent of medieval English. All in all - A Very Good Novel. The onus is now on Roy to come out with an equally good novel. The beauty of English will survive only through books like this!"
4,A rare jewel,"Seen through the eyes of the twins Rahel and Etpan,the story reveals itself through constant flashbacks and reminiscents. Sometimes sad, at other times funny, the lives of the characters tend to grow on it's readers. They seem so real. Roy's acute observations of life is so accurate, she sometimes makes me weep. This book has everything - the whole of human emotions, love, fear, innocence, corruption, politics but it is love that trancends it all. Though quite difficult to read, I personally find the book enriching and fulfilling."
1,Good story but for the words!,"I nearly gave up at the first couple of chapters .... I just could not get into this book, which I had the misfortune to take along on vacation. What I understood throughout the first half is that Sophie Mol dies. Then we look forward to the climax of her death but alas it is lost among childish phrases repeated meaningless sentences & you think to yourslef when you finish the book: Oh why did I even bother!The writing is extremely pretencous with no taste at all, the reader is completely ignored through refernces to things utterly indian & are a mystery to most. The plot is lost in the book & it's not even a good one at that!If you want to read about India, try Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance.My advice to you about this stupid pretencous book is DON'T BOTHER!!"
4,Good read but...,"This book is one of the best books I have read but it is a bit disappointing as the storyline is weak. As the first book of the author it is a very good but as a Booker winner it is below expectations. The authoress's description of rural Kerela is pictoral, a good point of the book. The supporting characters seem to have sad lives and there is no cheer. The 4 central characters have been portrayed in a manner which is very unique.Roy's style is refreshing and there seem to be millions of plots running but this is due to the weak storyline."
3,Disappointing; reread it to try and make sense. Poorly edite,"For >100 pages it made no sense, then began to fall into place. The middle should have been the beginning, the ending was the most coherent section. Given the cultural context more care should have been given to sequencing. Only in the last pages was the caste/ class/ color dealt with. That was VERY important. Can someone spell EDIT."
2,"too aware of being a ""great book""",I think this book has great intentions - the tragic tale of lost souls (etc.etc.). But somewhere along the line the author got trapped in language. There is an overuse of phrases and a lack of clarity in them;I'm not aways sure what she's writing about. Obscure and mysterious are fine (after all whose life is so clear) but not when they obscure the story.
2,disappointed,"I came to this book with great hopes as it had been praised by so many. I came to it on a real high after reading Rumpole's Last Case and the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night, both of which I really enjoyed. I found myself growing annoyed with this book almost immediately after I began reading it. Some of the prose is quite beautiful, but much of the time I felt it just got in the way. I don't mind long complex sentences, but I found myself skipping entire paragraphs here. Too many of her words and sentences seemed like needless window dressing and the small insights they proffered seemed inadequate for the effort it took to get them. I hate to give up on a book once I have started it, but this one is really trying my patience. I am about three-quarters of the way through, but there are many other books beckoning me that I think might be more rewarding."
2,"Good songs, recorded like crap!","The songs on here are really good, but the recording quality sounds like balls!! It sounds like they play the guitars using the neck pickup the whole time! You can hardly make out the chords/notes most of the time! It's very annoying after a while. This is one of their earlier albums so I don't expect it to sound amazing. But like I said, the songs are great in typical Gimme Gimme fashion. Must have for a gimme gimme fan, but I would get blowing in the wind or love their country first if you're new to the Gimme Gimmes."
2,Not impressed,"I feel I wasted my money buying this attachment. It is not strong enough to clean the cement. If you need something to just spray light dirt away, maybe this would work for you. If you need it to CLEAN the cement, don't bother buying this, you will just go back to using the spray nozzle that came with the pressure washer, like I did."
1,I stopped reading DL after this book,"Initially, I was glad to see that the DL dynasty would not die with ""Dragons of Summer Flame,"" but now I think the series should have ended there. Instead, we have been left with an airport novel which tries to borrow from Classical literature (gee, I think I've seen that tempest scene a few dozen times), but instead becomes quite dull. Rabe's writing is pedestrian and lacks the oomph that other writers lent to the series. The book is readable, but never conveys the background of despair against which this story is set."
1,A Bad Start to the New Age,"TSR politics and conspiracy theories aside, Jean Rabe was given the task of continuing one of the most successful fantasy novel franchises in publishing history. This was a very tall order and due to the popularity and skill of the previous world creators, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, many readers would dislike, even hatefully condemn Rabe's book, simply for the fact that Rabe wasn't Weis or Hickman.However, the argument that Rabe never received a fair popular or critical review due to her difficult position is moot simply because of how poorly crafted Dawning of a New Age is.Even if I allow that the new world order created by TSR within the gaming modules is a poor background upon which to draw, there is no rationale for the poor characterization, the awful scene description, the ridiculously constructed combat scenes, and the muddied, convoulted, hot mess of a plot.Simply put this book is not worth reading."
5,Best since Temples of Boom,"I'm not sure why people are panning this album. Because they didn't just remake their first record? What's the point in that? If I want to hear the self titled record agin I'd throw it into the cd player. I think this is their best since their 3rd record. Each track is full of hooks and it dosen't even slow down near the end like some of their more recent albums seemed to do. They sound re energized and tracks like ""LAtin Thugs"", ""another Body Drops"", and ""Til Death Comes"" are classics. And the nod to the Clash is appreciated. Cypress Hill (and this record) are going to be around awhile."
2,What happened?,"This ain't the Cypress Hill I know. On top of that, they sampled their other albums too much."
2,You Must Not Remember When They First Came Out!,"All the reviews that i'm reading that Cypress Hill is back nonesense must be too young to remember when they first came out. While this is better than stoned raiders, and it is the best attempt i've heard in awhile it still falls short. But like some of you have said it's not their fault entirely, alot of rap now a days goes right to the can. I'd definitely listen to it before I bought it if I was a new purchaser."
4,They're back,"As a long-time Cypress Hill fan, I can say that I pretty much will buy whatever they put out. But as an objective reviewer, I must say that I like their new album, Til Death Do Us Part. It's not their best album, nor will it be the most popular, but it contains some good tracks and will be enjoyable by the majority of the Hill's fans. Featuring songs with Jamaican sensation Damian Marley and Puerto Rican reggaeton star Tego Calderon, this album has a distinct Latin/Caribbean style that I liked. Although the single currently playing ""What's Your Number?"" might not seem like standard Cypress Hill fare, it's got it's on little catchy quality. I enjoyed Stoned Raiders and Till Death Do Us Part, as I think Cypress Hill is moving in a good direction after IV and Skull and Bones, which were alright, but nothing to write home about. Pick this up if you can't get enough of Cypress Hill."
2,Pretty good album,"This album has got to be among the worst album that the Hill has put out. I am deeply disappointed. After Stoned Raiders I thought they couldnt do worse. Boy was I wrong. The album starts out very good. The Alchemist-produced ""Latin Thugs"" was superb. His beats are always bangers. I think it was cool that B-real took a backseat with his verse. ""Ganja Bus"" wasn't as bad as some users said in the other reviews. Nice reggae/reggeaton beat. After the first 4 or 5 songs, the album takes a turn for the worse. I found myself bored. Cypress needs to go back to the vaults and come up with that classic formula that attracted much of their fanbase."
5,Amazing.,One of the best Kung fu movies of all time. Amazing fights and wonderful humour. Jackie Chan also sung the themesong for this classic. A must have for all Chan fans.
4,Nice Christmas Movie,"If you enjoy old Christmas movies with happy endings, this movie is for you. Kids as well as Adults will enjoy it."
4,Sometimes more is not better...,"This and Summer of Night are my two favorite Dan Simmons books. However, I enjoyed the short story version of Hollow Man more than the novel version. It was also the first book to ever instill any sort of appreciation for math in me. This is one of those books however, that I fear that if you do not understand or are unable to empathasize with the loss of a loved one, it won't reach you. If you can however, it will tear your heart out and you'll totally understand our Hero's loss and drive to try anything to be with his wife again."
2,DEPRESSING,"The title says it all. I've loved the author's other books, (Hyperion, Endymion, etc.) so I bought this. Big Mistake. There was just no light at the end of the rainbow, with endlessly dreary, depressing characterizations of life and people. Makes me wonder about Mr. Simmon's state of mind when he wrote this. Not a happy place. I also found it self-consciously intellectual, with all these hypostheses, equations, convoluted conversations, ad nauseum. So, bottom line, if you want to read something by Mr. Simmons, pick another of his books."
1,"save your money, this was the worst in a long time","simmons has been a good read in the past, hyperion was excellent great ideas and characters. the hollow man is one of the worst books ive read in a while and i have read many."
3,Cute but Mediocre Sound,"Someone had this and gave it to me because he didn't want it anymore. Radio reception in an office building is poor and the sound quality mediocre. It is a conversation piece, however."
5,"""Way Home"" CD by Wayne Watson",This is a great CD and was happy I could find it. The Spirit of the Lord is on this one.
4,Memories of Home while living as a Human,"Letters From Adam was an interesting read. I had had the great pleasure of meeting Will Maney for an intuitive reading that was amazing.The letters from Adam are applicable to all, holding universal truths that anyone can apply to their path. I found Will's description of Home during his near-death experience to be so wonderful, filled with humanness and Divinity. Will's journey has universal appeal with his delving into great metaphysical questions about the Thinker and the Thought Manifested - highly recommended!"
2,"Cheap, but expensive","I have already broken two belts on this vacuum after only 2 months of use--one because of a sneaky shoelace and the other because of a drop cloth. After finally finding replacement belts (I had to go to a specialty store), I discovered that they cost around $4 each. Judging from the look of shock on the salesperson's face when she saw the price, I'm guessing that this is a lot to pay. So, if you never accidentally suck up something you shouldn't, then you can save some money with this vacuum. But, I've owned cheaper machines that never broke when I made a mistake. It's up to you, but the way we're going in my house, we might as well buy the belts in bulk since they break very easily."
3,Death By Chocolate. 60's kisch meets poetry.,"Death By Chocolate is almost a harsh name to represent this type of music, perhaps 'living through caramel' would be more appropriate. The sound basically intertwines the poetic musings of Angela Faye Tillett with kischy 60's grooves, a combination of Stereolab's melodic doo-wop harmonies, The Bees/The High Llamas' retro experimentalism, with a touch of Japanese cheekiness, eg, Pizzicato Five. Glossing over this is the tinted haze of 60's soundtracks, complete with cheezy keyboards, a boxed yet cheery colorful sound. I must admit, although interesting, I'm not exactly a fan of the spoken-word vignettes which dominate half the CD, yet the strength of the music itself is a creative force making it worth a listen. Think beat poetry meets Russ Meyer soundtracks meets Rainbow Quartz label bands."
5,The Best Preaching Book so Far,"Have you ever heard what an FCF is? It's what is called by Chapell as the Fallen Condition Focus, and from it, we begin to preach on the Redeeming work of Christ. And every passage of Scripture would have a bearing on Christ because it is written by a Holy God to a fallen humanity.Christ should be supreme on all preaching. Wow! This book transforms preaching. Buy it. Underline it, use it."
4,Bernard has enormous potential...,"I have been a large Suede fan for a while now, and this cd is indeed the direction that they would have taken, if Mr. Butler had stayed on. Big guitars, but with slow arrangements make this record very unique. With a voice similar to Jonathan Donahue (Mercury Rev), this record can make you fall asleep. But it's sleep with a smile."
1,not as large as shown,The earring were much smaller than shown and now I can't give them to my Aunt as the gift I had intended.
5,More than just politics,"Having never have been to New Orleans myself, The Great Deluge was able to describe the city, its history and politics, in such a way as to make the impact of Katrina real. Brinkley successfully described what went right, and what went wrong, with the government response. His analysis of the politics of Katrina was easy to understand and highly informative. But the book is as much about the city and its people as it is about politics. I especially liked the stories of the coast guard emergency responders. Well done!"
3,Could be better if some research was more thorough.,"I am from New Orleans and some of the small factual errors make me doubt the rest of the book. Downman road is not spelled down-mann. Trent Lott was from Mississippi not Louisiana. There was never a Heather Allan at wdsu. He was heath Allan. The galleria is nowhere near the Sam's on airline hwy. You said that it is hard to get from Hammond to baton rouge in an hour at any time. In fact it is 38 miles. You can do it all the time. See, when you read these errors, you start to wonder about the ripping of the NOPD, timelines etc. Good story telling."
2,A Hack Writer.,"Brinkley's thesis could read ""Global warming, racism, and Ray Nagin indifference was responsible for Katrina."" The part that really chokes is the apology for bus drivers abandoning their duty because they didnt have a current contract with the city. It's not their fault. Theyre victims, too. If Brinkley is to be believed I cannot imagine how Nagin was re-elected.This effort reminds me of something a political hack writes."
4,A Detailed Account,"The Great Deluge delivers extensive detailed accounts of the experiences of individuals involved with Post-Katrina rescue and relief efforts. It is the most comprehensive of the various books on this subject that I have encountered. Reading this book provided me with a gentle catharsis. As a member of an assessment team sent to Gulf Coast about a month after Katrina devastated the area, I've been laden with the burden of many wrenching tales that have largely gone unreported. This book contains a wealth of very specific and well-documented reports. First-hand accounts of personal experiences results in a certain amount of repetition, and that's as it should be. Each set of eyes sees individually, and the consistency of these accounts bolsters credibility. This book should be required reading for anyone choosing to present themselves as knowledgeable with regard to anything Katrina-related. It's not a pretty picture. It is a compelling account of who we are as a nation."
1,Do NOT use on quality rugs!!!,"Not only did this not work particularly well on any of my rugs it ruined the nap on the very high quality rug in my living room; it seems to have completely removed a layer of wool or something - looks weird. Does not stop dogs re-staining same area either. We have a rescue pup who went right back to the same spot I had cleaned on a different rug. Completely bogus claims from this company and I suspect these reviews cannot be real. I will be writing to them to complain. And yes, I did use it as instructed."
5,Love it,"The perfect yoga mat. It's just the right length and I don't slip. It's a little heavy, but well worth carrying it."
2,It's like pulling out your own tooth,"It has to be done, it's loose and up your alley (Sci-Fi). You have to check it out, especially after seeing these RAVE rviews.But! Be warned: You may wish to get back that time you spent watching SQV.The acting is so horrible, it's unbelievable. Roy Schneider was aware of this as well and alas, left the show. Of course there's one or two good ones, but that kid! It's like torture! And maybe a story here and there, but you'll have to look hard.It's funny because I remember liking the show at the time (Remember that's 15 yrs ago now) but a recent viewing will snap you right out of your escapist childhood.Just beware. It is watchable I suppose, but I'd have to have absolutely nothing to do, and a broken leg."
3,"For students, not Mothers","I bought this during my first pregnancy. This book was written for college students, and is not very user-friendly for Moms. It is organized by subject rather than age of child, and focuses more on theory, range in characteristics and exceptions than a normal parent friendly child development book. It also sticks to in-field vocabulary, instead of common terms. So if you are a mother and you want a in-depth, in-field book go for it, otherwise there are much better choices out there. I would suggest the Sears books or Burton White's 'First Three Years'. Both of which I have found very helpful."
