2,Wasn't for me,I like simpler recipes. I thought a lot of the recpies called for too many ingredients and seemed like a lot of work. OK for someone into cooking but not if you're on the go.
5,Good Choice,"I have truly enjoyed the meals from this cookbook. The recipes are simple, but tasty. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple allergy conscious cookbook where the recipes are not so extensive that they took a long time to cook."
3,Interesting ideas,"I found the rotation diet information very helpful. My son is allergic to wheat(not gluten), milk, and eggs so the gluten-containing recipes is a nice change of pace. However, my son is a toddler and there are several recipes that would not be applicable. I also find it difficult to locally find the flours called for in most recipes."
1,misleading title,"Misleading title. Not dairy free. Not gluten free.I looked through this book, from the library, thankfully. It is not as the cover/title states. It contains recipes that call for dairy products, and various gluten containing flours. I didnt have my eye out for the remaining supposed -free items, but wouldn't doubt that it contains some of those as well."
5,Very helpful,This book has alot of helpful information as a beginner with the food allergen subject.
3,"Useful, but has significant limitations","Not a bad little hydration pack, if you don't need any storage. Sure, you could store your keys and/or a cell phone in with the bag, but there aren't any actual pockets and you risk getting your items damp. Also, due to the small volume (I actually get 32oz into mine) you wouldn't want to use it for a long excursion. Lastly, this model is VERY different from other Camelbak designs. The bag doesn't actually come out of the pack, which makes cleaning more difficult. The fill aperture is also much smaller than other Camelbaks, which means that the cleaning kit that they sell is almost worthless since neither the large brush, nor the drying mounts can actually be used."
1,After 2 years owing this - its crap,"I've had this installed over 2 years. Shoddy build and poor customer service. It never turned off after the preset time. After about 6 months one of the lights stopped working. It seems like the setting switches are there for show and dont actually do anything. Dont buy, its not a good value."
4,Heath Zenith Light,"Easy to install; however, I have had a problem when powering the unit after dark. It cycles on & off non-stop.Likely the sensitivity may have been too high, although that problem is not addressed in the instruction sheet."
3,"Not that bright, always on.","Well 300Watts is 300Watts, so it's bright enough for a driveway, but not for a medium sized yard. The main problem with this guy is that the light attracts a ton of bugs which trip the motion sensor so it's on constantly. I think I'll take the sensor off and mount it somewhere far from the lights so the bugs aren't swarming it."
2,worthless,Came on every five seconds all night long until both bulbs burned out in less than a year. How helpful. Do not buy. Get some LED tech and forget about motion-detection. All the products are bad for that.
1,No,"Why does this book exist? The proof that it is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle with compass and straightedge is not all that hard to understand.And, to an earlier reviewer. The issue isn't necessarily lack of proof; it's that it can be easily proven that his method doesn't work. You mention that measurements like pi can't be represented by numbers. Pi IS a number. It can't be represented with a finite number of digits, but that does not matter at all (MOST numbers can't be). Geometry isn't about measuring things like you might with a yardstick. Geometry is math. Numbers are an intrinsic part of geometry."
5,Captivating stories from a First Amendment warrior.,"What is clear from the accounts of Garbus' battles for freedom of speech is that the struggle to be free or to remain free will never end. Garbus also shows how one person (or a few) can make a huge difference in the free society we enjoy today. The book portrays many heros, several scoundrals, and events in the past that all jump off the page in a new light. I've added Martin Garbus to my top-ten list of people I would most like to have dinner with because I'd like to find out much more about his exploits in defending our right to hear and read anything others have to say."
3,Half Full,"The songs on Empty Glass are little mysteries. From the anger/forgiveness approach of ""Jools and Jim"" to the constantly transforming (I am an animal, I am a vegetable, etc.) character of ""I am an Animal"" this CD jumps from topic to topic with no apparent connection. Songs like ""And I Moved"" and ""Cats in the Cupboard"" are sheer time wasters amidst gems like ""Let My Love Open The Door,"" and "" A Little is Enough."" Far from a great CD, but with Townshend even the failures hold your interest."
4,Pete Townsend - 'Empty Glass' (Hip-O Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1980, as this was Townsend's third solo effort. I remember the day this record came out, as so many fans and critics alike were stating that this album could have EASILY been a Who lp. It's THAT good. Two tracks that got plenty of airplay on FM radio stations across the U.S. were ""Rough Boys"" and ""Let My Love Open The Door"". Two other cuts here that I was sort of taken away with were the intricately played ""A Little Is Enough"" and the rocking title track ""Empty Glass"". This reissue comes with four (4) good bonus cuts. An absolute must-have for all serious Who fans."
4,incomplete masterpiece...4.5 stars,"I'll save my 5 star reviews for albums on which (almost) every songs is excellent. ""I am an animal"" and ""keep on working"", at least musically, leave a something to be desired and ""Let my love open the door"" is absolutely too commercial. I also expected more guitar and guitar solos on this album as it's quite piano heavy.""Rough Boys"" and ""And I moved"" gave his fans the first hint of his now open bi-sexuality. ""Jools and Jim"" captures the essence of the 80's punky style without being annoying. ""Empty Glass"" and ""Gonna get ya"" (and ""Rough Boys"") are classic Townshend and, alone, make this album worthy of your ear and money."
4,"Good, but best heard in your own haze","The tunes and performances on this are excellent, allegedly dragged out of Pete in a haze of his own substance abuse. But the recording rots; it was one of the noisiest, fuzziest major act recordings of the time, and something of an engineering embarrasment. It works well when you, too, have, um, lost a little touch with reality and are in a bit of an edgy mood. The version of ""Let my love open the door"" here is lively, unlike the recently heard dirgelike remix."
5,Quick Square,Product arrived on time and in good condition. The square is just as shown in the description and has performed as would be expected. The is a quality product with 100 uses from transfering angles to setting up tools. This tool is always on top of my work bench within easy reach.
4,"A good, full function thermostat","This unit represents a good value. It has lots of thoughtful features, such as a button to tell it that you are home for the day and want the heat to stay on, and a meter than tells you how many hours of heat you have been using. It also offers plenty of programming flexibility that you would have to pay more for with products from other manufacturers.I also use the backlit 5-2 Honeywell. The Honeywell costs more, has fewer features, and in my view, at least, is not meaningfully easier to program, and is certainly no easier to use on a daily basis. I felt the Hunter had better installation instructions. The Honeywell's biggest strength is that it is smaller. Using it, I often find myself wishing it had some of the features found on the Hunter.My biggest gripe with this Hunter model is that the backlight makes an annoying, high pitch noise. It is also a little too large for my taste. Dollar for dollar, though, versus the competition, this is money well spent."
1,great digital thermostat,arrived quickly.wire labels do not adhere well to old thermostat wires -need better labelspackaged very good.programming too confusing!summer programming for cooling was awful.
4,"GREAT Product, definately worth the money","This is not a particularly expensive thermostat, but it might as well be because you get a lot more than you pay for. It was so easy to install that my not-particularly-handy husband was able to do it (he DID have to read the directions, but he did NOT have to ask for help). It works really well, we love the indigo glow, and the program is really easy to use and really convenient for people who don't work the standard 9-5 M-F that some thermostats limit their programs to. The energy-saver programs are also really nice. All in all, I think this was a great buy."
3,Not quite sure what it wants to be,"I think the combination of the academic sounding subtitle, and the rather lurid cover art illustrate the problem this book presents; it never seems to be sure whether it's trying to be PH.d thesis or a potboiler.The story it tells is fascinating, to be sure. It's remarkable to reflect how much social and technological turmoil the US was in during the time period examined, and how much of a struggle life was for many. This is the context from which Sandow, Houdini and Borroughs arose, and the authors thesis seems quite sound. But it's not particularly coherently developed. And the biographical details are a bit uneven. I found myself wishing for a deeper discussion of the flaws of the ""Perfect Man"" that Sandow, Houdini and Tarzan represented, perhap unfairly, for the book sets out to tell the start of Beefcake as an ideal, not it's whole sorry history.A worthy read, but not as compelling as I wanted it to be."
3,Not for those who liked Shaara's books,"For those of you who wanted to know more about Chamberlin after reading Killer Angels, Last Full Measure, and Gods & Generals you will be disappointed.It reads very dryly vs. the story-like read of Shaara's books.He might be a brilliant man, but his writing style is dry and slow."
2,Not up to old standards,"For those who read THE SEASONS OF ROME and enjoyed it, as I did, UMBRIA will most likely be a disappointment. If you enjoy travelogues then you may yet like this book. I, on the other hand, do not care where every little painting of the Madonna resides, or where St. Francis spent every night when he was outside his normal abode, ad nauseum. The author writes as if those who read his pennings are completely clueless as to current events (i.e. the earthquake which destroyed many historic sites) and then goes on to leave out much of what it was that made the headlines! In summary, not worth the bother, frankly."
4,Dora game is great for preschoolers,Game has very good graphics and my 4 year old loves to play without getting frustrated. Would recommend this game for 4-6 year old age group.
1,WHAT???,Heres the story ok my little sister 4 loves playing are gamecube then after that we had to hide the e10+ and T but anyway we got her this game becuse it looked easy she played the frist 2 levels and was borad if you are someone under 5 and whants a good little kid game go get the nicktoons games or sonic and mario
2,And then they were twee...,"As the follow-up to the epic Wind & Wuthering, this album is thoroughly disappointing. With a batch of lame, radio-friendly songs purposely kept short to garner airplay, Genesis should have titled this album And Then We Sold Out... Also quite embarrassing is Mike Rutherford's weak attempt at mimicking Steve Hackett's sorely missed guitar work. Burning Rope and The Lady Lies are the too-few highlights here. The band made a slight return to form on the following album, Duke, but this one remains an aberration within the Genesis catalog. Not recommended."
2,"Too bad, so sad","They really streamlined there sound here as a departure from the golden age of progressive sound they once possessed. Too bad there not making this in an attempt to be creative but to sell themselves into top 40 music charts. Don't get me wrong, change is good, but not on this album. Get Selling England by the Pound, Foxtrot, or The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway insted."
4,When your talent has talent,I credit Genesis with being the ONLY band who could elevate what was obviously a minor work into the stratosphere like this.
3,"Good, but not great","There are some tracks on this album that really stand out, but not like other in this band has produced."
2,Genesis' worst album in the modern era,"Yes, this is one of the band's weakest efforts, and that definitely says a lot for these fine musicians. Follow You Follow Me is the gem here, and that's available on the Hits album. Burning Rope is okay, but not worth getting this album for...Many Too Many is also a decent ballad, but not nearly what these guys are capable of. My advice is that if you have Hits, you don't need this album. You could even probably download Many Too Many off the internet if you have an MP3 player. Trust me on this one...I have every single Genesis album, and after I bought Hits (for the new version of Carpet Crawlers), I sold this clunker back for whatever little money I could get for it."
5,A fabulous book,This book is wonderful! I received it as a gift about a year ago and just rediscovered it. If you've ever been to England or have dreamed of going you should read this book. The author makes some very valid points about faith and living life that I had never thought about before. The chapters are short enough to read one every night before you go to bed (that's what I do). I would strongly encourage you to buy this book. It has been a true blessing to me.
2,It's good if you like Scrabblegrams,"I wanted to get a book with word and number puzzles, like the crossword number puzzles (sorry don't know the names). This book sounded interesting, but 98% of it was scrabblegrams (I must've missed where it said that). I like puzzle books with different games, not just the same ones over and over. It has a few word searches but they're so simple.. no brain work in it at all. And the mistakes!! In a word search, an entire line was missing! And in a bunch of scrabblegrams, the bottom line circles were either in the wrong place, or not there at all. Just a lot of careless errors. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Beautiful Art,I've loved this edition since I was a child. Too bad it's out of print. The layout for the cover of the newer edition is not as elegantly done. Trina Schart Hyman was one in a million and will be greatly missed.
3,so-so,"I read the reviews for this item before I purchased it, but they were mixed. The supplier's service was excellent, but the product is a disappointment. I am not going to return it because it was relatively inexpensive and works ""well enough."" I do have problems with the retractable lines getting jammed, even though I am careful with it. This happened after I had only used the core twice. Also, even though it is a 20-foot cord, it seems much shorter because the cords come out of two separate openings (10 feet each)."
1,DO NOT Wast your time with this product...period,"I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke..."
3,"Today, Tomorrow , Forever","The remixing could have done a better job of letting Nancy's voice be the most important part of the music. The base is particularly dominant in several pieces and it sounds like Nancy is almost backup to the instruments. There is a flatness to the music, too. This may be all the mixer had to work with, but Nancy's voice is certainly not ""out front."" the 3 star rating is more for the mixing than her voice or the songs."
4,Goes beautifully with this heart-wrenching film,"I saw the movie twice and knew right away that I would have to have the soundtrack. I'm glad that I invested the money and bought it! The score is absolutely gorgeous, despite some comparisons to ""elevator music"" by other reviewers. Don't let the naysayers fool you. ""Tristan & Isolde"" is fantastic, a great CD to put on while you're having dinner with a sweetheart or just relaxing - it will both calm your jangled nerves after a long day and inspire you. It is very well composed. As to the mutterings that a nod to Wagner should have been included, this is the soundtrack to the movie, not the opera. It does a fine job of standing on its own. Don't miss out on this one!"
5,No Words....,"The awesome power and beauty of this novel leaves me almost wordless. I was enraptured from the minute I picked it up.Powys puts my deepest, profoundest and secret emotions into words. Everything in this book as a soul..a spirit. Powys's writing is lyrical, poetic and breathtaking...I bookmarked many pages for the beauty of the sentences and the images and emotion they evoked.The right kind of person will fall in love with this masterpeice, some will hate it. If you are the kind to love this novel...then you will have one of your new favourites."
3,"3 1/2 stars - the last ""real"" Genesis album","I consider this the swan song of Genesis as we know it. This was the last album made before Steve Hackett's departure from the band, and as far as I'm concerned it's been all downhill after that as they enter their commercial ""we want hit singles"" stage. Not as good as Trick of the Tail, but Hackett keeps this album afloat. Blood on the Rooftops is definitely the best song of this album."
5,"If you buy only one old Genesis, buy this...","Sounds weird, but this is a really beautiful album. And better than the others for someone who is not a Genesis fanatic. Buy it."
3,"Ok, but not the best.","Pretty good info on the cities I went to, and pretty good maps, BUT horrible connection and transportation information -if you don't want to get ripped off in Morocco it is essential, for example to have some idea of the prices for taxis from, say the rail station to the medina - and this guide does not give those as Lonely Planet does. Also was quite vague about connection information between cities. Overall, I was disappointed with this guide and found it wasn't terribly practical for use 'in the field'."
2,No secrets is here,"I bought this book and the Lucky Guide to Shopping and found the tips given in the other book to be better. If you were deciding which one to buy, I would say that I didn't find this book as helpful in identifying basic or classic pieces and there are relatively few practical shopping tips that I could use in the future."
5,A must have Passport album,"While this album overall is not Passport's best, the first rack Ju-Ju Man is certainly the best song they have ever done. This song is a mixture of African rythms, funk and progressive concepts. The 15 minute song is engaging from beginning to end and the solos are top notch. The second song Morning Sun starts slowly and just when you think you will fall asleep, the tempo changes and Klaus Doldinger's sax work demonstrates why there will never be another sax player to match his talent.The rest of the album is marginal, but is still better than any fusion being done today."
4,I love it but...,This stuff is very good. I use it almost everyday. Everything is fine but it has no time-delay for porridge . That shocked me at first. And it gets 10 beeps when task is done. So it can be used as a wake up alarm clock.
3,My least favorite Discworld book,"I've read about a dozen of the Discworld books and this is my least favorite. I had come to expect great books from Terry Pratchett and this one was disappointing. It was OK, but it was lacking much of the humor of the other books."
5,"Vamps and werewolves and igors- oh, my!","Pterry takes on some of the ""urban fantasy"" tropes as only he can do. I loved his take on the various beasties, and the way they fit in- sort of- to Discworld life."
3,"Good, but not great...","While I agree with others that this is not at all a rewrite of Lord and Ladies, this also is one of the weaker books in the series.The quick story is that the king has invited vampires into his kingdom - an invitation they quickly accept so they can take it all over. Of course, they have to contend with Granny Weatherwax and initially she appears to be a push-over...The vampire portions are really well done and I enjoyed them a lot. It was easy to see their motivations and empathise with them (despite their dark nature.) The witches behavior was much more haphazard and odd - none of them appear to be strong characters (except Granny, of course) and instead appear to just stumble into everything. While it's true that is a large part of Rincewind's appeal but I guess I don't expect it everywhere in the Discworld. Oh well, it is a funny book with some of the best humor he's written - I just wish the other parts were just as solid as the comedy."
3,It isn't Love At First Bite...,"""Witches Three"" or ""Witches Four""? Somehow, it was inevitable that Prachett would exploit the ""Witch in Government"" scenario he set up. Granny Weatherwax is still one of his most intriguing characters, and she's just as cantankerous as ever. Still-I really had a hard time warming to this book.Up-scale vampires I meet every day. Government up-scale vampires I work with every day. I hate 'em. The vampires are poorly developed and not really interesting; if it wasn't for Nanny Ogg there would be precious little humor at all. I've re-read the book to make sure I didn't miss something... and I didn't. This one is weak and not funny.Prachett does present some philosophical outlooks on human existence that give food for thought. As far as I can see, that's the only thing that makes it worth while to get this book. Stick it in your collection and read it once in a Blue Moon.Heavens to... Murgatroyd!"
3,Pratchett sets his own standards...,"... and an unfortunate result is that he sometimes fails to meet them. Although this book would be considered the pinnacle of success for lesser scribes, we know what Pratchett is capable of, and this isn't it. Unlike most of his works, this one didn't even tempt me to reread it once. Lords and Ladies was not one of the top five either, but redeemed itself with the Shakespeare connection. This rewritten version of L&L doesn't quite pull it together. A few concepts are introduced which receive better treatment later. Pratchett seems to be experimenting with the neo-vampiric theme here, but handles it much better in ""The Truth."" All in all, some good concepts that didn't form into a book."
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"Love From Your Friend, Hannah is a great book. I like how she writes to many people like her best friend and the President. If I could tell everyone to read a book, it would be this one!"
3,A Quality Batbook,"I enjoyed Batman: Long Shadows. While not at the same level as Morrison's or Snyder's takes on Grayson as Batman, this was still a better than average story. What I liked in particular was the exploration of Alfred's feelings toward the passing of Bruce, something I don't remember being covered in this detail in other Batbooks. I also enjoyed the dialogue between Dick and Alfred which was quite funny and had an honesty to it. Nothing too original with the rogues, but I thought they were intelligently written as well. Long Shadows will lead me to read more by Judd Winick."
4,HOT! Grab it if you see it!,"IT's already becoming hard to get! If you like a little punch with your Gary Numan, a little punk with your Nu-wave, the hop on to the ride of your life with Add N to X at the wheel! Yum!"
1,Stella Dallas DVD,This item was advertised as region free. It is in PAL format and cannot be played on American DVD players. So it is useless to me.
2,Factual but Boring,"If you are going to read this book do it on your own time, but if you are looking for one to do a report on stay away, stay far far away. The enitire first half of the book is about what other scholars say and the last part is just plain confusing."
1,Recipe UnWarrented,I'm confused; each recipe calls for 0/32 measurements of ingredients -- that doesn't add up to anything. I have serious reservations about these recipes.
1,Where do I get Oklahoma crabs?,"I have wanted to try the 19th century crab recipes Warren's great, great, great Grandmother passed down to Lizzy, but I have yet to find Oklahoma crabs anywhere. Have they gone extinct?"
1,Drums along the Nohawk,"I'm 50% Nohawk and 50% Nearoquois Injun. I'm from the Mohawk Valley in Upstate New York, and I'm perplexed that this book didn't contain a reference to Auriesville Corn - the bestest corn in the world. Lie-zy, how could you?"
1,YUCK,"This book is awful,This is like comparing My Siclian Grandmother, making her her Pasta by opening a can of Franco American spagetti, and microwaving it. UGH!"
2,read the cover first.,"there are no pictures! yes, there is some pretty sketches and plans, but no pictures of the finished product.."
3,Drawings - not pictures,"The book have a lot of good ideaas for how to draw / design houses. There is a lack of pictures of the actual solutions, in order to give a good idea of how the the solutions actually work.Jan T."
4,pleasant but not fulfilling,"The book is large and would be best as a coffee table book. I am looking to expand my knowledge of small homes, green living and such. This book while interesting did not cut it for me. The drawings are understandable, but the information on each design is minimal, and more photos (if the design has been built) should be included as well to give a better sense of what the house in question will look like."
5,I love it!,I love Batman: The Animated Series. Arriving at home after class in college was a thrilled because I loved the style and substance of BTMS. The actors were brilliant. Kevin Conroy is the standard that other actors must emulate before putting on the cape and cowl. The writing and artistry were exemplary.
1,Not a good deal...poor quality.,"The car charger broke, the wall charger came apart. I didn't really need some of the other stuff. Not a good deal afterall."
4,Perverse,"England, England, England. Yes, this album just oozes Englishness!!!!! If you are used to later slick Genesis productions then this may be hard work to listen to. It really is a mix of themes and musical styles but an essential purchase if you are a Genesis fan."
3,The ultimate English Public School LP,"I have to say that after the brilliance of 'Trespass, 'Nursery Cryme' was a minor disappointment. Maybe this was due to new joiners Steve Hackett and Phil Collins trying to find their place in the band -- unlikely, but possible.The verses of some of the songs have little melody: compare the monotone opening of the 'Musical Box' with 'Looking for Someone' on 'Trespass'. I think it exposes Genesis's songwriting technique of the time -- lyrics first, then the music -- as risky. You don't always create the best tunes that way -- rather like some of the recitatives that link the arias of a Mozart opera.But to me, this wonderfully eccentric english music conjures images from the film of the LP Hartley novel, 'The Go-Between', made around the same time and set in a country mansion in Norfolk."
4,Way-Dark Psychedelia Twinged with Nausea - Brilliant!,"Musical Box, Return of the Giant Hogweed, Seven Stones, Fountain of Salmacis... great songs of the period, especially when Gabriel screams, ""Touch me, now, now, now!"" on Musical Box.The whole aesthethic of this outing was way twisted. That darn cover is NOT something that should have been laying around while one was getting off on a hit of blotter. I mean, the little weird Victorian chick is playing CROQUET with a set of human heads!This is underworld, twisted, dark stuff, probably some of the weirdest aesthetic since King Crimson ""Lizard."" Albums of this day succeeded in creating whole worlds and mind-sets - they were movies that crawled under your skin and took over your mind.""Nursery Cryme"" and its puke mustard color scheme... I'll never get this thing out of my mind.Too bad Gabriel left Genesis later on."
5,SOME OF THE BEST WORK!,I LOVED IT.IT WAS HARD TO IMPROVE ON THAT BUT THEY DID.I CAN JUST SIT AND LISTEN TO THEM FOR HOURS.THEY ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS THAT I THINK I WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO SEE LIVE!
5,Re-connecting With An Old Friend,"I put my original worn-out vinyl album in a garage sale during the mid-1980s transition to CDs. Recently, I broke down and bought this wonderful remastered edition. It has been like re-connecting with an old friend. Gosh, was there anything better than those 1970-74 Genesis albums? I find everyone who followed the band during that era to still cherish those recordings. Strangely, if you missed the era, you don't seem to care. My son, an accomplished musician, loves 1960s and 1970s rock, but doesn't get the whole art-rock phase, and NC leaves him cold. He thinks the guitar and keyboard solos sound like uninspired scale exercises. I guess you had to be there."
4,Listen to Stereo PCM not DD 5.1,"If you like Ani DiFranco, you should like this DVD.Regarding the sound quality, I much prefer the Stereo PCM 2.0 mix. One shouldn't always assume a 5.1 mix (Dolby Digital or DTS) will be better than the stereo mix. The DD 5.1 mix for this release makes it sound like Ani was playing in a big empty hall... very hollow sounding, with too much audience noise and echo in the surrounds.The stereo mix is completely different without the above complaints, and Ani's guitar is mixed louder. To hear it out of my 5.1 speaker system, I often choose the Dolby Pro Logic II Music mode - as this sounds quite good.Thankfully, the video aspect ratio is widescreen anamporphic, not 1.33:1 as stated by Amazon."
2,good information but pricey,"I was interested in this book because I wanted to understand the transformation of Russia from the under-industrialized nation of the First World War to the heavily industrialized nation of the Second. This book supplied me with insights into that transformation. I was surprised, however, that I spent so much money on so small a book. I expected there to be much more. While the information was of interest and use, I don't think it was worth the money I invested."
5,enchanting and lovelier than ever.....,"first and formost i just want to say this is one of a must have cd, for all of you theatre of tragedy funs. Such romanticism and enchanting music will suite you listeners out there. every track from this album is very put well together. non stop live performance from liv and the gang. from ""venus"" to ""cassandra"" to all of there classic hits....it is so suiting to listen too! plus a two cd rom video included....so enough said! all i can say is play it, listen to it, and let the music take you to a journey, a journey beyond the realm of your wildest dreams....that will put ""closure"" to unfulfilled dreams..."
1,Horrible,"I believe that Jehovah's Witnesses have the truth. Anyone who allows themselves to believe rumors and accusations without first speaking with the witnesses are just as ignorant as the author. You need an unbiased approach, not that of the example we have here. They use the New World Translation (not a version) and do not limit themselves to just that. Plus in addition they not only print the New World Translation but other translations as well, such as the King James Version. Jehovah's Witness teachings reflect the teachings of the 1st century Congregation and not that of tradition etc. Former JW's are those who wanted power and glory for themselves but they couldn't get it there because the witnesses serve God and not men. So such proud ones are removed to protect the congregation. I would strongly sugest that this book should be considers not trustworthy."
1,"Lies, bias","Book not worth the price I paid. Full o bias and lies. It seems that the more letters they can put after their name, the more they think they are educated. What a bunch of has-beens. They should go back to thleir schools of lower learning. They do not know their Bibles at all. they quote scriptres out of context and know not what they are talking about. Gil"
1,Give me a Break!!,"This is the most awfuly biased book I've ever read...not a single true thing is in here. If you want the truth on Jehovah's Witnesses, ask them. These are not ""Facts"" at all, but rumors and misconceptions."
3,Not a very human story -- very much about the machine,"I bought this because I wanted a good background to the combat actions of the Corsair in WW2, plus something about its origins. I thought it would do that, but mostly through the stories of the individuals who flew the things. It did this, but with much more of a focus on the machine, I thought, than I had wanted. Sure, individuals are mentioned, but there's not much life in any of them -- they show up, climb or dive at so many feet per minute or at such and such knots, shoot down x many planes, and disappear, replaced by another climbing, diving, roll-rate-intensive take on another episode from the Pacific.I'll finish it, but it's more of a history of a thing than one of people, and that lack of humanity comes through in the writing."
1,don't be fooled,"This item doesn't work for changing the smell of kerosene. I used way over the recommended amount, and the smell difference wasn't enough to to even notice. Also thought from the pictures of item, price was for 4 bottles. It's only for 1 bottle."
3,Seems to work ok,"I use the vanilla version and I can tell the difference in the odor when I don't use it. One bottle lasts me, usually, a season, but I will admit I have never ""smelled"" vanilla or anything like that. The wick burns longer and the kerosene odor is reduced. I have tried my heater with and without this additive and it seems to operate slightly better with it and I don't think it is all in my head. Price is right as well."
4,When all you need is a cellphone,Why pay for a camera and a phone when all you really need is a cell phone? This was my problem and the SGH-X496 was the solution. Great design and great performance.
1,one of the stupidest movies i've ever seen,"OK, here's MORE ...-talking on the internet about Jay and Silent Bob! While I think THEY are hilarious (in other movies), this movie is unbelievably stupid. I'm a big fan of Clerks, Mallrats, etc...but I absolutely hated this. There were maybe a total of 10 actually amusing minutes! Sometimes trying to be stupid for laughs just simply doesn't work and is annoying. Thankfully I saw it on pay-per-view and didn't buy it, so I saved some money. I suggest you watch it on TV before you buy.Also, if you're offended by foul language (which I'm not) you will hate this movie even more than I did. It was even too much obscenity for me.RATING = NO stars!"
2,oh MY this movie is Stupid!!,"This would be one of the worst movie ever made if I didn't like the Jay and Silent Bob Characters....the movie is HORRIBLE... the plot is so stupid.Some of it was a bit too vulgar as well.... not in a funny way like the previous movies but in a stupid ""American Pie"" type of way. Yuck!I still like Jay and Silent Bob the characters.. they were my favorites in the other movies... I can't BELIEVE how [junky] this movie was.The ENTIRE thing about the monkey was stupid.. every last scene with or about the monkey [stunk].The entire time they talked about how bad the movie was IN THE MOVIE... he knew it was a bad movie.. so why did he make it???"
1,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Out...,"Alright, before this movie, i was a huge Jay and Silent Bob fan. Clerks is one of my favorite movies of all time. But this movie was a huge let down. It was too unintelligent and immature for my taste, and the plot was ridiculous. Sorry to those of you who liked it, but i thought it was an overall pathetic movie."
2,Oh I was so disappointed...,"hey, i love Kevin Smith as much as the next man or woman, but this movie just plain sucked. yeah, the scooby doo scene was a nice and appropriately stoner reference, but that was the highlight of the film (no pun intended)."
5,My guy loved the gift,"Jay and Dilent Bob never cease to entertain, even outside of the independent film industry. With phrases like 'whats the internet' and jabs at daedons creek and american pie, who wouldnt laugh?! Bluntman and Chronic are at it again; with the classic cast members from Clerks, Msllrats, and Chasing Amy."
4,"""my man aint your babys dady"" ""bring it on""","im tired. iv been writing reviews all day so here.""buy this its funny"""
2,The lamest of the bunch,"Absolutely the worst of the ""series."" Clerks and Mallrats were brilliant in their inanity with great characters. ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" lacks any of the charm or wit of the previous films and is clearly a blatant attempt to cash in just one more time. Just horrible. There are no less than 3 times that the characters in the movie look at the camera a smirk/shrug, a true sign..."
1,Slow Torture,"If you didn't spend your time smoking dope during your formative years and you made it past your freshman year in highschool, you'll find this movie vulgar and just plain dumb. I like crude and lewd as much as anyone, as long as it's clever and witty. This movie has none of these qualities. I loved Smith's ""Clerks"" and ""Dogma"" but this one is a real turd."
3,"well, if you gotta do it....","I have to admit, I LOVE Kevin Smith's movies. If you haven't seen them, (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Mallrats...) there's really no point in bothering with Jay & Silent Bob, becuse it's so obvious that this movie was made for the hipe and the money, where the other movies all had...well, a point. I will say this, though, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back had me laughing my rear off for most of the movie, just watch out for the cheap shots: CONTINUOUS shoddy references to his past movies."
1,To ... obscene for me!,"After reading a newspaper review and seeing commercials for this move I bought it thinking it would be something I might like. The review I read never warned me however of the constant use of obscene language this movie has. No kidding, the ""f"" word is used at least 20 times in the first 7 minutes of this movie and it never lets up. I can handle an occasional curse word here and there in a movie, but Jay & Silent Bob seems to be purposely trying to set some kind of record for most obscene words used in a movie, and I believe they have succeeded. Without the continuous vulgarity this may have been a funny movie, but I was too busy covering my ears to find out!..."
3,Pretty Good Comedy!,"I saw this movie a year ago and thought it was pretty good. The movie is about two pot-heads that go to Hollywood to stop a movie from being made based on them. On the road, they encounter a hitch-hiker (George Carlin)who teaches them about the ""book off the road"", Jay and Bob saving a monkey, running from cops and Jay falling in-love with a hot girl named Justice (Shannon Elizabeth), and beating up a Priest. See what they'll do next."
3,not the usual rock cliche stuff,"jim carrol, author of the basketball diaries, is many things. poet, basketball prodigy turned junkie, writer, and now musician. jim carrol leads an underground scene of art poets in the vein of patti smith but there are also elements of punk, 80's rock, and if hip-hop/rap is defined by singing/rappin about the plight of the ghetto then add that to the list because jim carroll is one diverse soul.the music is pretty smoking although i love his lyrics. i think they overpower the music at times. jim does not so much as sing but ""speak"" talk like lou reed (think wild side) the music is hard to pigeonhole or define. it is rock but its also very abstract leaving interpretation open to the fans which is the mark of good art and a great artitst. jim and company are both."
1,funny but not functioning,"These were part of a larger pink flamingo event for Halloween. Lights were funny but did not work. Bummer. However, other flamingo stuff we ordered worked great and added to our White Trash party."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,I just saw this movie and it was great. The music played during the movie was awesome. I ran out and bought the soundtrack and it is horrible! None of the good songs in the movie are on the soundtrack. It is a total letdown.
1,BOOM?,"I'm sorry, was the biggest song of the entire soundtrack not ""Here Comes the Boom"" by Nelly? Somehow someone w/absolutely sucky taste seem to miss the whole boat on selling music. Talk about someone voluntarily promoting the theft of music...the creator of this CD wanted every person to not pay for the song & it's happening! Congrats record company for a job well sucked! & sorry Nelly for all the money you lost out on by not being smart enough to talk these record producers out of trashing your song."
1,The only horror is bad art.,"Be afraid,be very afraid-of grade Z stuff like the films in this collection. They are very amaturishm-more like something you would see on youtube, than real movies. Think Ed Wood with a camcorder. Ladies and Gentlemen, you have been warned."
4,"Entertaining, but a bit drawn out","The book will hold your attention, primarily because the exotic setting and the wartime atmosphere make the novel a better read than the confusing detection process alone would have. The detective himself, an American in a British organization, seems like a fish out of water. More character development, beyond making him a blunt man who says ain't and seldom sleeps, would have helped. (Perhaps this is the way British authors see us.) Some locations, such as the Kit Kat Club and the houseboat, are used too often. Nonetheless, this book will get you through that transoceanic flight."
5,Perfect,"I'm only going to buy this from now on. I use the lightest shade for my extremely fair skin. Pairs with foudation well, also. Doesn't spill when you drop it, and it goes a long way!"
5,Clinique Loose Powder Transparency III,"Don't you hate it when your blush fades and your foundation seems to evaporate into thin air?Well, I found that Clinique Loose Powder is the best powder for my makeup transformation. I use Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, but I found a light brushing of Clinique's Loose Powder kept my transformation looking morning fresh!Simply, brush a light coating of Clinique's Loose Powder and your transformation will last 4-6 hrs longer (I don't use the tiny brush that is included). I have Clinique's Compact Powder too, but prefer the loose powder. Occasionally, I use just the powder alone and brush on a smidge of powder blush. Looks much more natural, but I like to hide my freckles."
5,Aussie Punks...who would've thunk it!,"Punk Blues? AC/DC are a blues band with a punk soul and Let There Be Rock is one of the finest examples of it. Angus is unbelievable on this lp. The jams are some of his fastest and Bon's voice has never been more raw and soulful. Go Down...Listening to this I can't help cheer Bon on and scream...Go Down! Go Down! I remember listening to this album and contemplating how could this album ever be outdone. Amazing enough they have and continue to. The band is without Bon today but the legacy continues on...with that jamming and that solid voice. And God said, ""LET THERE BE ROCK and He named it AC/DC!"""
1,Wrong version downloaded.,The version adversted with John Savage and Rebecca De Mornay was great. I saw it on TV and it's much better than the Disney Version (which was a big disappointment). The problem was when I went to watch it I ended up with some stupid move made in 1962 with Joyce Taylor and Mark Damon. It was very poorly done. I'm really upset that the correct version didn't get downloaded.
2,Not as expected,This book was purchased to help a family member dealing with labyrinthitis. She did not enjoy the book at all and did not get many if any answers about her illness or how to cope with it.This book is not recommended.
1,Horrible Seller,"I ordered this book for a class I was taking on the 26th of January. The book's estimated time of arrival was February 3 through 18, it never came. I emailed the seller three times without a response and finally had to file a claim to get my money back. I no longer needed the book because I dropped the class. I am awaiting a refund. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM XCELLENTEP, or whatever the seller's name is, you'll never get what you purchased and it will take forever for a refund."
3,How Complete?,"I bought the Astronomy Today:Stars and Galaxies, 4th edition paperback several years ago. Amazon lists the HARDBOUND 6th edition as having 848 pages, while the 6th edition two section paperbacks have a total of 1024 pages listed. I have NOT SEEN the 6th edition so I don't know what the 176 pages consist of."
5,if you have gophers you gotta have this,"Great video. Until I watched this I was using Macabee traps and a table spoon to TRY to catch the critters. Watched the video, learned about gopher behavior and how to SMARTLY go after them. Got some cinch traps and hori-hori knife. My yard isn't gopher free yet, but it under control. The cinch traps are't cheap, but they are well worth the investment as was the knife. I also use the traps for moles in spite of the author's recommendation and they work great.kh"
4,Nice replacement remote!,"Install the batteries and start using, it's that easy. Every function available on the original remote works on this replacement."
4,Works Well,"This remote works really well on my 57 inch Mitsubishi. I recommend this for anyone looking for all the basic functions like imput, video, sound ect.."
3,Works but not great,"This is my second remote from the same manufacturer I purchased for the same TV. The last one worked for about 15 months then quit, this one is sluggish at best when communicating with my TV. My TV is 12 yrs old so there is not alot to choose from when buying a replacement remote. Hope I don't haveto buy another before the TV quits."
4,"This is a TOY, not a two-minute timer","I received two timers, one red, one blue. I timed each: the red timer was 1 minute, 28.7 seconds, the blue timer was 1 minute 50 seconds. As an illustration of the fallibility of telling time by sand timer, these make excellent toys, since only a little time spent turning them trying to figure out ""how long it takes"" illustrates the problem of attention/dropping/resetting that plagued early time measurements. And that is a worthwhile lesson. For measuring two minutes? Not the thing to order."
2,"Outside plastic, inside glass=your kids will figure it out how to brake it","My 2.5 year old loved this toy, until he figured out how to take it apart, and slide the glas out of the plastic cover. He broke it in no time.Otherwise the timeing was off 5-10 seconds.It was fun for what it costs."
1,"Defective and broken product, bad refund policy",Both sand timers arrived with broken plastic edges. The blue one had a piece stuck inside the plastic casing that protects the sand timer. The quality is below acceptable. Shipping back the product will cost equal or more that the price of the item. Only buy it if you have some money that you want to waste
2,King James english is overdone,"Good message, but it is unbelievably tedious the Elizibethan english that is used. Painful. What were the authors thinking to go out of their way to write in such an unnatural way?"
2,Barely Acceptable,"As a native Mandarin speaker, I give this DVD a C+ at best. This is definitely not a professionally produced DVD. The young man on the cover is the lead actor in the DVD, and he speaks Mandarin with Southern accents. It would be like learning to speak English with a teacher from Brooklyn or India, not an ideal choice. (I really don't mean to offend anyone from Brooklyn or India,it is just an analogy, my apology.) After watching the DVD for about 15 mins, I promptly returned the DVD I borrowed from the library without showing it to my child. You may have better luck teaching your child to speak Mandarin with Mandarin versions of cartoons such as Pororo, Noddy, or Pocoyo."
4,Nice addition for Camel collectors,"This is a pretty decent album, rough at times but very worthwhile if you're into Camel. Half of the cuts are Camel covers, the other half are Bardens solo pieces, presumably, which are basically pleasant new-age songs. The CD has no info on personnel or date of concert, but I'm almost certain this is not the Mirage lineup with ex-Camel members Andy Ward and Richard Sinclair."
4,Good for all stages,"I've taken yoga classes before, but I have to admit that I'm an extremely inflexible person. The great thing about this DVD is that, in addition to Louise Solomon doing the workout, there are three other women, one of whom is a beginner and is pointed out at the beginning of the session. So you can watch her if you're just getting started, or if you're inflexible or have a bad back. Otherwise, there are more advanced variations on the moves as well. Additionally, there is an advanced total body workout at the end that is still quite difficult for anyone in my household to do (yet).The instructor has a soothing voice and explains how to position your body quite well and also tells you what each move does for your body, which is obviously one thing that you'd think you'd miss from doing a DVD at home and not taking a class. I found it quite easy to follow. It's also not too new-agey or anything, so if that tends to irritate you, this one probably won't."
5,"Clear, concise, very interesting","For a first introductrion to philosophy, this book provides the reader with an interesting approach to artistotelian modes of thought, through intersting examples and clear defenitions"
1,Christian Spin on Aristotle,This is not an objective presentation of Aristotle's thinking but rather it's Mr. Adler's wishful interpretation of Aristotle as some sort of Christian. Many better books are available on Aristotle.
4,Good vintage surfing,If you like Endless summer and those types of vintage Surfing movies this is the one for you. Siestas and Olas is a wonderful nostalgic roadtrip/surfing movie with entertaining narration and of course some great waves.I felt like I had lived the trip myself by the end. Good fun and relaxing.
4,The Great Ernie Davis,"I grew up in Syracuse and as a 11 year old saw Ernie Davis play in 1959 against Maryland.I'm thankful that this movie was made to finally recognize this great man and football player.The movie itself is filled with inaccuracies,i.e.the long touchdown pass was the second play of the game.The racism is overplayed, Ernie Davis was not a vocal ""activist"" as portrayedin the movie ,he was a kind generous human being who all of us shouldtry to emulate. All of today's players should see this movie ,see the definition of class,you'd never see Ernie Davis do a dance after a touchdown."
3,not like it was....,"I am very disapointed by this new calendar. No writing at every pages, not funny or cute stories about everything. I don't known if I am going to buy the next one. Did anywone known if they are any other calendar, like this one in 1999 ? A warm hello from France !"
2,Not What I Expected,This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund.
1,DEFINITELY DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,"I totally agree with the other reviewer of this game. The numbers are very hard to read, and many sellers show the screen as being backlit with a blue light and having very easy-to-read numbers, so when you buy the game you think you are getting a decent product but are really just getting a piece of junk! Definitely save your money until the game is greatly improved!"
3,Good Game - Tough to Operate,We are really enjoying the game. The puzzles are well done and the board is easy to see. Our only complaint is that it is difficult to figure out the operations and the cursor can be tough to spot.
1,Incomprehensible rubbish in my opinion,I waded through this nonsense and I am beginning to understand why so many people dislike lawyers.
1,No Merry Christmas,"This is what my daughter wanted for Christmas. But here we are, Christmas day, and it won't work because of a pixel shader problem. And if you go to the website those folks say if your video card is more than six months old, you might have problems. Oh, well, thanks. Try explaining that to your eight year old. Merry Christmas."
2,"It's okay, but high graphics needed","When I bought this game I had an old computer and was kind of disapointed because it required a very high graphics system. So I had to drive two hours away to the closest Best Buy with my brother and my dad to go and get a silly GeForce 1700 Graphic Card for my computer. It took about 30 minutes to take the old card out and stick the new one in. And once I started to play the game, it was a waste of my time and money! I was very disapointed. It was not at all like the first one. The graphics were better, but the gameplay was not the same. I can't remember all of it because it's been so long since I've played it (about two years). The only good thing about it was that the graphics were better and the surgeries were more detailed. It's a fun game, but not as fun as the first one."
1,CRAP,I wanted a flashlight that I would never need batteries for. That is not what I got these lights that have a small metal sylender inside that is non magnetic and will not charge. These lights use 2 coin cell batteries that last only 12 hours. The coil isn't attached to the PCB at all. After 12 hours it is dead and with no way to charge them they are useless.
4,An Enjoyable read,The Pastor's Letter was a very entertaining and enjoyable read.One that had me drawn in from page one. It kept me reading to find our what would happen next.There were even a few surprising twists to the story. Some things I was amazed to see had happened .
1,tung oil based,the description states that this product is tung oil based....I called the mfg to find out what the percentage of tung oil is...they told me that NO man 'o war products contain any tung oil.... so whats is the story folks......
3,Coincidences Abound,"The setup for this thriller was rather enjoyable and had me flipping pages as fast as I could read, but as the plot began to unfold, I found myself shaking my head at the silly dialogue and numerous coincidences the author tried to slip by me. Unfortunately, it didn't work and I found myself disappointed. However, there was enough moments of originality to rank this book above average. This is one of the rare cases where the book would make a better movie than a novel, which I'm sure we'll see develop in the next few years. Mild recommentation."
1,Stunningly Bad,"I started to read Creepers because I found the idea of urban explorers intriguing. I finished it because I didn't want to feel that I was being unfair in giving it a bad review.The Good:- The POV is consistent enough as to not be confusing.- The verb tense is appropriate and consistent.The Bad:- The characters are terrible - flat, boring and unlovable.- The plot - I couldn't always see what was around the next corner, but it was always disappointing.- Morrell's prose style - shallow, weak descriptions, weak language, just plain bad. He uses ""seem"" too much, way too many adverbs, way too many dialog tags.I had no attachment to anything that was going on in the book. I was certain this MUST have been the author's first published novel and was shocked to find out it is his 24th! A more emotionally rewarding way to spend several hours on the coast of New Jersey would be watching a marathon of MTV's Jersey Shore."
5,Creeped Out Page Turner,"A book is good when the reader has to put it down for a few minutes too creeped out to turn the page. I had to stop at least twice to garner the courage to turn the page.This is my first David Morrell book and it did not disappoint. This book is a blend of adventure (exploring old buildings illegally), history (art, architecture, furniture, even clothes), horror (deformed cats, rats and other creatures), child sexual abuse and multiple murder mysteries (old and new) blended with lots of suspense.I couldn't understand why these ""explorers"" continued on after 2 people almost died on different occasions and this was before the real adventure even began. Common sense says if the building is that unstable or dangerous leave. But, greed is a real motivator which is explained later on.Warning: Read this book with all the lights on."
3,Nobody likes bad reviews...,"I preordered this book. Im a huge Morrell fan. Its a fast read easily done in 8 hrs or so but not one of his best. Its probably closest too Burnt Sienna in quality but the lead character reminds me of The Protector.The hero of the story is prior military and at first you think it will be one of the prior special- forces- with- some- black- ops-secret-training type guys. but it isnt quite that way. The story is one tragic blow after another to the characters. They never get the edge up on their ( numerous ) attackers.The book is well written of course and has a good creepy atmosphere ( no pun intended ) I recommend you wait until paperback on this one or, if you havent read them, read Fraternity of the STone or Brotherhood of the Rose. Two of his best."
2,Skimmer,Impossible to read slowly. Great for a plane ride. Some interesting info re urban explorers. But you can see way down the track early.
5,wow,awesome price quick ship thanks daughters phone was dead you help me get her off my back will definitely buy from again
3,very unusual especially for Fellini,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Fellini's first color film, released in Italy with the official title of ""Giulietta degli spiriti"" is also the most unusual I've seen yet. The plot is about a woman with a husband who is cheating on her. She then descends into a hallucinatory world of her mind.Some of the dream sequences are what I would expect from a Rene Magritte painting while others are more 'normal.' They are well photographed and have many good scenes. Giulietta Masina, who played the lead role was also Federico Fellini's wife.There are two specail features which are a theatrical trailer and an interview with Fellini by Ian Dallas.This film while having high acclaim, could have been better in my opinion."
2,Who finances these movies?,"I honestly can't say this is the ""worst"" movie I've ever seen. Considering it falls into the Spoof Comedy category it's pretty average for these types of films. The last 5 I've seen were real stinkers.I couldn't make it all the way through in the first sitting. That tells me a lot about a films re-watch value. It has none.Definitely in the top 10% of the worst movies I've ever seen."
1,"No laughs, no fun.","Simply put: this movie is horrible. I don't know how you can call any movie that doesn't deliver a single laugh a ""comedy"", but this one somehow did it. It's not funny in the least at any point. Leslie Nielsen in drag...that's the highlight of the film. No reason for him to be in drag, but there he is. Kenan Thompson should fire his agent if this is the best he could deliver the man for his SNL Summer break. This film tries to find humor in bathroom scenes (it has 3...all toilet jokes...all stupid). There's nothing redeeming or funny in this film. If you're looking for ""Scary Movie"" kind of laughs, you won't find them here."
3,This move is a great mistake.,This move is a great mistake. I had Zero expectations when I set down to watch this film. Critically this movie is bad!!!!!!! But look at it at face value and you will enjoy. There is some really bad scenes buy keep in mind this was never made for an Oscar!!!!! The film is a Horror spoof which is in turn a horror of a film that I did buy. The film follows the Scary Movie genre but has some of it's own magic.
1,"like a sudent film, only worse.","Not a (A)class film. I might have done better if given a chance. This is a awful movie. actors are horrible, the writing is stale and in need of alot of improvement, and I must urge people not to waste time watching. you've been warned."
4,Applique with a twist of dimension.....,"This book would appeal to a new quilter as well as an experienced quilter. Step by step directions are given in order to get the beginner ready to applique. The slightly experienced quilter may have never begun the dimensional aspect of applique, so this book would appeal to that person. Very much similar to any other Baltimore Album book, but nicely done."
5,"Strange, silly, funny... WONDERFULL!!!","Douglas Adams, well he is just a genius, he can take solid fact and twist it in to a gelatin of silliness that despite itself makes acerten kind of sense, his books (the hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy ""a trilogy in 5 parts"", Dirk Gently's Holistic DetectiveAgency, and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency part two the long dark tea time of the soul. I mean the names!!! He's ahoot!!!) make you keep laughing (getting all kinds of funny looks on the buss :-) and thinking ""I've GOT to remember this oneto tell my friends!!!"" and U ALWAYS screw it up royally, because you just cant seem to understand the fact behind the silliness foras long as you would like!!! He's simply WONDERFUL!!!Rev. Colin Stone . . . . . . . . .00.-------------------------ooo()ooo------"
5,none stop excitement,douglas adams shed real light on a subject few authors ever even dare to touch.he made me want to stop and take time to appreciate what i do have and feel lucky about what i have lost.he kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time
1,Sent extremely late,"I ordered this book for a summer school class, and it was not even sent out until three weeks after I ordered it. I received the book five weeks after I orginally ordered it, and two weeks too late for my class. I was and still am very annoyed by the seller."
4,Great intro statistics text,"Moore and McCabe is a great textbook for an introductory 1 semester course in statistics. The text is clear and not cluttered with unnecessary details. The examples are accompanied by many colorful charts and graphs/plots. They take a more ""classical"" approach to teaching statistics (which appears to be falling out of favor) but the book is very good."
1,dissapiointed,"I WAS HOPING FOR MORE, WALLY BRYSON WAS AWESOME WITH THE RASPBERRIES, BUT HIS SONS SONGS JUST DONT CUT IT FOR ME."
1,leaks,It was fine for a while but now it (and the other one in another color) leaks as you drink. Would not buy again.
5,Warrior,"If you have received clarity from God to see where the enemy has ravaged the world around you and you are seeking to take back what he has stolen, this is the book. It has helped me to identify and strategize my prayers and to become more effective in my prayer life."
1,Buyer Beware,"I've known of Cindy since the mid 90's.She is a false prophet and as goofy as they get.Between her and Chuck Pierce, there are no 2 people who give more nebulous, vague, generalized hoodini prophesies in the world.Trust me. Try Graham Cooke or someone else but stay away from this rebellious women."
4,Wings of morning,"Love the time difference, by the time I got to this book I new what was going to happen. But I wanted to read more of Kathleen Morgan books."
5,WINGS OF MORNING,I gave this book FIVE stars. I'm a sucker for romance and loved the lesson of God's love and forgiveness
4,Barbie Chat Diva Doll,"This doll was very hard to find before Christmas this year. I was glad to have found it and my daughter loves it. Her mouth actually moves to her own music and ""chats"" when you put the phone next to her ear."
2,Sort of boring,"My daughter wanted a talking Barbie and this was the only thing I could find. She only says two phrases, or rather says one phrase (""Love it!"") and sings/raps the other. You can plug in your iPod, but she doesn't sing along. She only repeats her two phrases. That being said, my daughter does play with her, in the same way she plays with any Barbie. Could have saved myself some money and bought a regular Barbie."
3,Alkalizing Diet,"The book was disappointing. There were no sample menus or lists of foods to use. I did like the first part though, describing the organs of the body and body parts. I did not agree with the metabolism of blood types."
2,Book contains little information from Edgar Cayce.,"Edgar Cayce was referenced on the front cover but there there were only two chapters in the front matter. The book is a collection of other diet ideas including Eating for your Blood Type. The book is ok, but it wasn't want I wanted or expected. Alkaline water wasn't even mentioned, and per my research, is one of the fastest ways to creating an alkaline balance. And wasn't that the title of the book? If you're focused on alkalizing your diet, there are better books."
2,Everything is good ... except the story,"The concept of the show is very good, it s true, but the story is plain stupid.I don t want to spoil it with exact details, but the complications that happend throughout the episodes are so obvious and easy that it completly loose it s uniqueness. Just as things are already bad it gets even worse, and worse, and worse some more, to the point where you know that no matter how they ll try to solve the case they ll always fall short of the solution (say ""I love you"" one more time, please...).Some dramatic parts are exagerated (instant amnesia anyone ?), some are completly unrealistic.To guess what s going to happend next, just ask yourself ""what could go wrong ?"" and it ll happend.The only positive part are the actors, the music, and the concept."
3,"What sort of a name is ""Kiefer"", anyway?","The real-time format is innovative, and there's some excellent writing and acting here, but it's not nearly as good as I'd been led to believe.Too many freaking plot holes, like when the cute alien makes the little boy on his bike fly across the moon. That moon is WAY too large. I think they fixed it in post. But I digress. You spend the first ten episodes of 24 hooked, but as you get deeper and deeper, you realize that the writers fall into the X-Files trap of layering twist upon twist until you wish they'd shot the film on a bloody quasar where each hour lasts only twenty seconds and you're done in time to catch Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Around episode 23 the implausible penultimate twist turned me off completely; I won't be watching Season Two. See The West Wing instead."
5,Great title but WAY cheaper elsewhere!,I got this at BJ's brand new for $19.99Sorry Amazon...price check register 3!
4,Great Show --- But where's the advertised Season 2 teaser?,"""24"" was the BEST show on television last season. Of course I quickly ordered the DVD set, and recieved it... today. The image quality and sound is spectacular, and my review WOULD have gave it 5 stars. BUT, it didn't have the advertised ""Season 2 teaser trailer"" that hyped me about the DVD release in the first place. Happy with the show and the bonus ending, but upset about the teaser that was taken out."
2,OK Drama with some worthless filler,"The drama is ok, but as with the typical television drama series of late I find the ""filler"" storyline threads worthless and at times irritating. The primary thread has some very interesting twists and turns, enough to actually keep you interested, however they keep sidelining to the lead actors personal life and the trials and tribulations of raising a teenage daughter...that just blew it for me. I won't bother with a second episode."
1,An Expensive Soap Opera,"24 is, plain and simple, an expensive soap opera. The producers have managed to outfit the stuff of middling daytime television in the garb of Clancy and Bruckheimer--a feat which must certainly be a delight to studio executives and marketers, but a disappointment to those looking for the rare gem that has made its way from broadcast television to DVD. The inventive chronological premise, high production quality, documentary-style handheld camera work, and Sutherland in the lead, can't conceal the mishmash of cliches and stereotypes that form the ""substance"" of this over-hyped melodrama. How far Fox has fallen since the X-Files."
3,One more thing,"This is an addendum to my earlier review of 24 Season One where I indicated the Season started great but got a little silly mid-way thru.Without giving any spoilers I must also criticise parts of the Season Finale which while offering some possible surprises also make no logical sense based on the actions you have seen in the prior 23 episodes.In other words, after knowing how the first season ends, if you re-watch the whole season from the beginning and pay close attention to the characters, their actions, the opportunites they have and how things evolve, then the surprises at the end of the series are kind of just tossed in as a way to throw you off rather than having any logic or continuity."
2,A Waste of 24 Hours,"Having heard so many good things about this series, I decided to give it a chance.What a waste of time it ended up being. Sure, each episode ends with a cliffhanger, but the whole story is so far fetched, and so over the top, that I quickly grew quite bored by it. In fact, I was surprised at how much I dislked this series.I haven't given any of the other seasons a chance, but after seeing this first season, I doubt that I will. However, based on the reviews here and elsewhere, my opinion is obviously very much in the minority.For a far more engaging series that also deals with counter terrorism, check out the BBC's ""MI-5"" (a.k.a. ""Spooks"") - also available on DVD from Amazon.com."
4,"fun, but am I being brainwashed?","This series is fast-paced, addictive, exciting, and fun to watch. However, I notice the recurring theme of ""torture is ok, if it has to be done"" and ""its ok to break the rules/law if you have a good reason"". The characters often do have a good reason, but is this show teaching Americans that this is how our governemnt agencies should be expected to operate?Maybe I'm reading too much into it. Watch it and decide yourself."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"I just finish watching season 1 and can't wait to start on season 2. I do not watch any TV shows besides The Simpsons and sports but this is just too good to be missed. Warning to everyone planning on watching this (and you all should) DO NOT assume anything, DO NOT read the enclose booklet, and to the people that does reviews for this please DO NOT include anything that could be a possible spoiler. PLEASE. And make sure you don't have to get up early the next day because you will be hook for hour after hour and will not be able to get too much sleep. A show like this deserve to be enjoy by everyone."
5,Great Book,"Rob Kowal is an exceptional poet. He has the ability to put to words what many of us can barely articulate. Walkabout is vivid, gripping and enlightening. It's got the rhythm of a funk song and the inspiration of soul. I highly recommend it."
1,Decptive Seller - Stay Away For Own Sanity,"I have received the Barcelona Student 1/2 size violin I purchased from Austin Bazaar. I have tried to contact Austin Bazaar on the phone twice and left 2 messages. They didn't contact me back. I emailed Austin Bazaar and they replied with 3 links of their policy OF 30 DAY RETURN IF THE ITEM IS DEFECTIVE AND SETUP INSTRUCTIONS. I followed the 3 links they sent me to setup the violin AGAIN and had no sound. I tuned the strings with the Korg Chromatic Tuner TM-40 I bought from Amazon and matched the tunes of G, D, A & E. But, it doesn't have any sound when I pulled the bows. It came with 2 bows and both don't work. Austin Bazaar ignored my voice messages and emails by refusing to call me back and reply back with the Return Authorization Number. BUYERS, BEWARE OF THIS SHADY SELLER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,awsome violin,blue violin is the best green cello ive ever played. the purple bass has a beutiful sound and plays like meeko!of course how would i know seeing as how ive never bouht or played it or seeeeeeeen it!
4,very pleased,"I was very pleased with the video ""Harem"" I had been searching for it for years. It was shipped in a timely manner."
1,dont waste your money,these rollers suck. the clips cant hold anything! that dot on the roller that says if they are ready never changes and the felt has no slit to grip them. its really hard to roll and to keep them in. a waste of money. and if they get knocked over all of them go everywhere. i bought the conair rollers that are pink and they are great.
5,love it,"I had a Clarinet growing up and i love to play, well i retired my old one and have been talking about getting another one but just never got around to it. well for christmas this year 2010 i got a new one. i love it. it sounds great, plays well and i LOVE the color.Music is my life and i cant wait to pass tihs on to my daughter when she get to the age to play!"
4,Solid bargain for an amateur instrumentalist.,"I just began my transition to the clarinet a couple of months ago after a few years of playing classical guitar and all I have to say is this is a solid product for a beginner as well as an intermediate instrumentalist. It is extremely well-built, has a nice feel to it and the button platings feel very good in your hands. The only downturn is it weighs slightly heavier than many other clarinet models. And I recommend you to buy new reeds for this clarinet since it comes with two cheap bamboo reeds that break or crack very easily. Also what you're getting is not a hard case as shown in the photos but the foam case as shown in the last picture that is very light and protective."
4,Well Worth The Price!,Bought this for my sixth grade daughter for second year of playing the clarinet. We rented from school last year & this one is much nicer & plays just as well. Not to mention cleaner & prettier. It is perfect for beginners to 2-4 year students. Probably not for advanced players or someone who is very sure they will be playing for years to come.....but...like I said.....Well worth the price.
4,It is what it is...a cheap pool boat!,"Not for white water, open ocean, or other deep areas where a person would be in a lot of trouble if both outer chambers fail, ""it is what it is""...a basic pool boat. This one says it seats 2, but realistically, that's one full sized adult or 2 children.That said, it performs beautifully in a pool or shallow, sheltered bay or lake areas. Inexpensive, easy to maintain, and bright yellow for safety, it's a ""CLASSIC"""
1,Great Disappointment,"We had such high hopes!! Unfortunately, after throwing away the box... and using the raft only once... we discovered that it leaked air. It was used once in our pool and the next morning it was a little soft and each day it became squishier. We have been unable to find this little leak which we assume to be in a seam somewhere since it had not been used in a way that would damage it. Anyway, we feel ""stuck"" b/c by the time we would box it up and pay to ship it back, it would nearly be a loss."
2,mediocre,"I believe this is exactly the same program as Imagine it! Sci-Fi put out by Macmillan together with Simply Media about a year ago. There are a few outstanding images, but many of them are very poor. Most of the good images are copyrighted so you are very limited on how you can use them."
2,"GO TO VEGAS, SEE HUEY NEWTON","The movie oozes with adolescent immaturity from the opening scenes until the final credits. A successful film that degrades to the inane starts out with something realistic and takes the descent in steps. This one starts with a guy taking a nude blowup doll (while inflated) on a plane. While the film idea was great, especially the ending, the execution was awful. Poor direction and script. Worth avoiding if you are over 18.F-bomb, lap dancing and groping, less nudity than expected, crude humor."
3,"OVERALL AN OKAY MOVIE, NOT TO GET EXCITED ABOUT",This movie was okay with some humor. Some of the other parts were stupid and did not belong in this movie. Vegas rules!
3,It's the only option...,"...for the time being that is. This book is okay to get you started but it does lead to other questions that the book doesn't get into. I found the books web site sample applications weren't all working which was frustrating to say the least. As far as getting started, you probably could do just as well with the on line tutorials at the Macromedia web site. I did find the step by step instructions on setting up the server very helpful and much more complete than the documentation that shipped with the FCS software. In that sense it made the book worth the price yet I am waiting for better books to arrive. I would agree with others that this book was rushed to publication but at least its available. FCS is supported with Director MX but I guess this is so new the book didn't get into it."
2,I felt that this book did not provide enough resources.,"This book did not offer enough resouces for parents. It was also pessimistic in terms of the outcome for dyslexics. It was very helpful in terms of identifying characteristics that are not often associated with dyslexia,yet it still appeared to be very general in catergorizing these characteristics. One of the methods for teaching reading skills, however was very helpful but other methods should have been given as well."
5,Whatever Wall Clock,Excellent. I actually owned this clock before and when I had the roof redone it vibrated off the wall and smashed. it took some searching but I was bound and determined to get another one.
4,Clock,The item was well received by the my sister. She had seen one before but never did purchase it. It was great.
3,Clock,"Love the clock, but it is a little loud with the ticking. I had this clock previously and it wasn't as loud. But I love this clock"
2,Promises are not met,"The ad and description for this phone promises full-duplex operation, but the phone does not deliver fully-duplex operation. It does not allow two way simultaneous transmission of conversation. Thus, important phrases and sentences can be cut off when conversations overlap. The whole reason I bought the phone was for the FD operation. Now I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't deliver on its promises."
3,New Link for Vysotsky's Koni Priveredlivye (Fastidious Horses),"I was looking for Vysotsky's Koni Priveredlivy (Fastidious Horses), but of course it wasn't on the soundtrack. There is a weird lounge version available on Amazon (but it's not the good one from the movie), and the link recommended from a few years back doesn't work. Fortunately I was able to download the good version from the following site:[...]Hope it works for a while!"
4,Took Awhile To Process,"The CD was ordered and took close to a month to get delivered. However, the CD was the perfect product to replace my aging cassette tape."
3,A dated soundtrack...,"80s movie...80s soundtrack. There are some excellent tracks on this CD. Among them ""People Got To Move,"" ""Other Side of the World"" and ""Look Out Baby!"" I have never seen the movie, but I use the soundtrack in my Walkman when I exercise. So so."
3,Vladimir Vysotsky,The song you are looking for plus many more can be found at: www.kulichki.com:8105/vv/eng/Hope this helps. Have a Happy Holiday.
3,US NAVY Seals Glossary+Great Book,"This book was sort of a glossary, combined with a book of stories. It had a lot of definitions inside, along with stories, which made it seem like it was more of a dictionary for Navy Seals. This book was still an interesting book, and a good book to read, although I was mislead to think it was more of a story book. The CAR-15 name for the M4 im not sure is correct, but I have heard the term. But I haven't seen a m203 on one I guess"
4,Solid Performer for Home Office,"Good all-around printer-scanner-fax for home office use. I could only find one flaw, and that was its ability to recognize different ring-tones from Embarq. I cannot use the auto-answer feature because I have three ring patterns, and it confuses two of them. Beyond that, it is a great product. I don't get that many faxes anymore, so it is really a small point in today's technology world. Printing and scanning is fast and accurate, especially on draft modes. Good value for the money."
2,Just say NO,"My first issue with this printer is that you cannot print business cards on it. It refuses to recognize the borders, goes ""borderless"" and thus you have messed up paper stock that is not exactly cheap.It claims you can use 57 color ink cartridge, but you can't, you have to buy the 22, which has less ink.If you are out of color ink, it will not let you print B & W.I've had it just over a year and now that it is out of warranty it keeps giving a power error message that HP tech support was Useless in helping me with. BTW, don't expect anyone from an English speaking country to ""help"" you, HP tech support is in India.LAST HP product I will EVER buy."
5,Well worth the money,"Got this yesterday and installed it in less than an hour. The ease of installation is phenominal. I had a couple of documents that I needed to have scanned and was waiting for this to arrive. I also printed photos of my son's wedding from a DVD. Quality was as if I had taken them to the local corner drugstore. Color was sharp, black and white very clear. I knew what cartridges were needed when I ordered this and took advantages of the free shipping by ordering several extra ones to have on hand. I bought another brand top feeder several years ago. It turned me off of the all-in-one printers for a long time. Ended up just giving it away. Couldn't get rid of it fast enough. Have been with HP ever since. This is my fourth HP printer product over the years. Also have purchased an HP computer. Have printed out more than 30 cookbooks over the years. HP printers just keeps on ticking! And I expect this one to do the same."
3,HP Officejet All-in-One,This product had some type of defect in it (the cartridges would not load properly). A replacement was generated quickly and without much difficulty though. The replacement is working fine.
2,officejet 5610 sucks big time,"The unit detects the expiry date of the cartridge and if the cartridge has expired, then it will display error: print cartride error. And all the other fucntions like faxing, scanning, printing, copying will not work just because of the cartridge expiry. I mean I can surely scan or fax something even if my cartridge has expired. No, you can't.Doing a search on the hp web site, I noticed that the cartridges used on officejet 5610, hp 27, 22, and 56, were listed in the will-work-beyond-expiry list on the official web site itself. But unfortunately it will not on an officejet 5610.Printing a few pages on this unit so far, I have spent almost USD 40 on replacing the cartridge. You bet hp will sell the unit for only USD 100. They expect you to spend much more on the cartridge. So, my next printer will not be a hp. Maybe I will buy a laser printer."
1,Ink cartridge sucker of the year,If you want to see how many ink cartridges you can buy in the shortest amount of time this is the printer for you. I use my printer at home with minimal printing and yet have had to buy new color cartrdiges within a week and 1/2 of replacing the first.
2,The Honeymoon is Over!,"This printer/fax/copier worked just great for about a year-and-a-half. In fact my original review was very positive. But then the thing just died without warning ...6 months after the warranty expired coincidentally enough. The only help I got from tech support was an offer to sell me something else - which I bought because I was in a bind - the 6310 model and it has lasted longer but never printed a colored page properly a day in its life and at almost two years old has not aged well. There was a time when HP was the best of the best for products like this, but I think those days are over. How sad!"
3,HP Officejet 5610,Poor packing and handling. Damaged when arrived. Get credit back fast. Responsible seller.
2,Mediocre at Best,"Bought this printer several years ago. Performance was average for an ink jet printer. Construction quality was mediocre-minus. For no apparent reason, one day, I found I couldn't seat a replacement ink cartridge in its receptacle. Some of the innards has shifted around and it wouldn't accept the cartridge. HP support was hilarious. The poor chap that took my call had to walk me through all sorts of inane questions starting with: ""What version of drivers were we using?"". After about 30 minutes of walking through the bronzed block diagram he eventually agreed it was a hardware problem. And, to their credit, HP mailed me a replacement frame which did fix the problem."
1,Worst Printer Ever Owned,"This is the absolute worst printer I have ever had. It's complete garbage as many others have stated. This thing printed fine for a week, now and for the last year it won't print colors correct no matter how many cartridges I've replaced nor what color profile I try. Print jobs constantly get stuck and the ink doesn't last long. I won't be getting another ink jet from HP ever!"
5,"HP Officejet 5610 A-in -one Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax",So far I have enjoyed good success with this product and would recommend it to someone who might be in the market for a similar item.
5,HP Officejet 5610,"Recently, I purchased the HP Officejet 5610 to replace my old #5510. This product is JUST AS GOOD as the previous model, which I ""ran into the ground"". I do a LOT of Genealogy printing and this unit just keeps ""chugging along"".The fax is easy to set up and use. Haven't tried THIS scanner yet, but the old one was very good.Would recommend highly."
2,Disappointed,"This is a good device with useful features when it works properly; however, I had some minor problems with it (it stopped functioning from the buttons on the printer itself, and none of the solutions I found online worked) and called their support. They couldn't care less about my problem or whether or not I choose HP products in the future. Refused to escalate my call or my feedback, though I was very polite, etc.I will never, ever, purchase an HP product again, and I will shout the same from the highest rooftop. Buyer beware."
1,Wow- everything went wrong except sending fax,"After about 6 months of VERY light use - we can't print, copy or receive faxes because we constantly get ""ink carriage jammed"" error message and the scanner software NEVER worked. After several calls, HP Customer Support is still trying to see if it's under warranty. But with so many things NOT working on this ALL-IN-ONE, I can't recommend it at ANY price."
1,If you are a Gamma World veteran don't waste your time on it,"Having played and owned every version of the Gamma World rules (1st - 4th edition) This new book from Wizards of the Coast is not Gamma World (just like 3rd edition is not AD&D). Mutated Plants and Mutated Animals is no longer part of the game. Sure there are some premade of each in the game, but if you decided to play a mutated wasp it is no longer possible. None of the rules have been kept and when reading the book it lost the sci-fi feel that is gamma world. Veteran players don't matter anymore as this is apparent from current releases from WOTC. The only use I have found for the rulebook is as a room divider for my gerbil."
5,An excellent book about how to treat others for kids...,"I have read this book to our children. It is extremely charming. The pictures and the dialogue go hand in hand. The author gives a wonderful tribute of her own experiences with her Grandfather and passes them along to the reader.Buy this book, and it will be a treasure in your family's collection of literature!"
4,African American string band a real gem.,"The ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" movie and soundtrack sparked my interest in Americana music, and that is how I was first exposed to the Mississippi Sheiks. If you are a Blues, Bluegrass or Americana fan, you won't be disappointed since the Sheiks incorporate all of these genres into their music. The Mississippi Sheiks (as well as all African American string bands) deserve recognition and should not be allowed to fade into musical obscurity. This rare and beautifully simple musical style is being carried on by today groups, such as the Nashville Bluegrass Band, whom constantly acknowledge Bluegrass's African American roots. Even though some of the recordings are scratchy, due to age and recording method, Vol 1, 2, 3 and 4 are a treasured find!"
3,Wallace & Gromit the curse of the Were Rabbit,"Very good film the grandson loves it and so do all the rest of the family, Only problem is that no note when sending for it to say that it was a district 1 and will not work in the UK as needs to be district 2."
2,Not nearly as good as rated.,"We went as a family, mostly because the movie had 4 stars to 4.5 stars as a rating. Although it was colorful, the lines were drab, and the humor was barely there. We all love humor and so we were disappointed. Basically, it is just a movie for little kids, I would say 3 to 9, although our 9 year old didnt care for it."
5,Wallace & Gromit - The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit,"Dear kids,I think you would LOVE this movie!Even if you are very young,You will LOVE this movie!Seriously,Take my advice,Rent it,Buy it,Or Barrow it...NOW!!!!!Sincerely,Matt Aurand"
5,Good fun,"This movie had my two kids laughing the whole way through (they're 10 and 7). Even the expressions on the bunnys' faces made them laugh.The plot's pretty simple and probably outlined elsewhere. The movie retains its ""Britishness"" but isn't too colloquial for American audiences.Good to see a 'G' movie that the whole family can enjoy."
1,Pointlessly Anti Christian,"The movie has several none-too-subtle very anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of a clergymen (in this case, an Anglican cleric) as a bumbling, moronic old coot who insists on purveying medieval superstitions and utter nonsense as Truth. -- Whatever happened to family movies that portray both the Faith and clergy in a positive light?!I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm and don't buy it!"
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!,"To me personally the ""Wallace and Gromit"" movies are the best, cutest, kindest, wittiest and what`s very important - the cleanest movies ever. Love them all!"
3,so-so,"this movie had gotten so-so reviews from just about everyone I talked to.I suppose I'd probably have to give it a so-so review myself. It wasn't a bad movie. About what I expected actually. It had a few funny moments. Although I don't think it ever reached the same level of zaniness of the original Wallace and Gromit animation. The big climatic scene at the end was good, but not great. All in all, not a bad rental, but it's probably just as well I didn't make it to see this in the theaters"
4,Ideal Replacement Unit,"This is a better version of a unit that failed after 20 years of continuous service. I needed to replace the old unit without going through a completely fresh installation and this unit fit the bill. Although the old unit had a different brand name, I believe that it was probably made by Honeywell. It's exactly what I was looking for."
1,"Nice premise, but crucial contents are junk","While the premise of this product is fine, the box that I received contained clay that had hardened into colorful hockey pucks - useless for its intended purpose. While I understand that this particular instance of the product was produced by a now defunct company and that the new versions have better quality clay, THIS IS THE JUNK THAT AMAZON SENT. I detect a trend here. Retailers foist their outdated junk on consumers through Amazon - and then everyone involved pretends its not their fault. Just watch out and make sure you inspect each Amazon product before your credit card dispute time runs out."
1,Don't waste your time on this movie,"This movie was not exciting. I expected it to be very scary. It turned out that the plot was completely predictable with NO SURPRISES! Recently my mom rented an old movie called ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,"" and it was was much more exciting, scary and blood curdling. Watch it instead. I was even more scared the second time, when I already knew what was going to happen."
2,not that good of a movie,maybe kids will like this but overall this movie stunk. eddie murphy was horrible and the story really didn't allow him to be any better.
3,"Starts Off Good, But Then Eddie's Charm Has To Carry It!","The beginning of this movie was very promising. I think the movie needed a better middle and ending. The ""bad guys or ghosts"" weren't ""bad"" enough, and the ""good guys"" weren't ""good"" enough, so by the end of the movie, you weren't sure who you really cared about - if anyone at all.I think Eddie Murphy still has an amazing presence on the screen, so he manages to carry the film even in its low points.This is a fun-family film, but not an outstanding one; just a good one.See ya next review!www.therunninggirl.com"
4,Funny and Entertaining,The best part about this movie is the references to Disney Land's Haunted Mansion ride. Takes me back to my childhood. Of course Eddie Murphy is always great fun.
2,This is not HD,"First of all, the movie is fair at best and is best suited for the younger ones. But, the title claims this release as HD. It is not. I've received a standard DVD twice when ordered. Amazon was gracious and have agreed to pay return costs. Since then , I found that Disney has no HD releases. Please be careful."
2,Disney- WHY these people??,"This movie had the potential of being great, but now there is no going back. Why was this family used in the film? I cannot relate to these guys for the time period or situation. We are avid annual passport holders and live in pirates and haunted mansion ride. I am completely crushed at the way this film turned out and what could have been.Pirates of the Caribbean was awesome thanks to Depp and creepy Rush. See that first."
2,oh god. the horror.,"This movie is a hopeless failure as a YA suspense story, and it's all but irredeemable as a comedy. Honestly, the best part of this movie is the opening credits sequence--a pleasantly Victorian and abstract couple of minutes peppered with T.S.Eliot-esque tarot cards, red wine poisonings and tragic suicides. The credits promised me a movie that would not suck. A curse upon those credits and their misleading level of quality, for the movie that followed them made me weep for the Eddie Murphy I knew in Beverly Hills Cop."
5,Great speedy service,"Found this movie for cheap in very good condition. Would buy from them again , I forgot how much I loved this movie and ride at Disneyland!!!!"
1,There's a more cost effective way to see this short,"This short subject was a promotional film made in 1931 to aid in collecting for charity. It is cute enough and notable for the appearances - however brief - of so many stars in one film including Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Edward G. Robinson, Wallace Beery, and of course, Norma Shearer, whose jewelry has been stolen. It is also included onComedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collectionfor just a little more than is being charged for this one so-so short film. Plus you get a total of 50 films including a bunch of Buster Keaton short silent films, an Ernst Lubitsch - ""That Uncertain Feeling"", and an odd little comedy starring James Cagney entitled ""Something to Sing About"", which was made when Cagney was having one of his feuds with Jack Warner over his contract. That is a much better buy."
3,A&E/History Channel Samurai Review,First and most importantly let me save you Japanophiles some $$$. This doc and the History Channel doc also sold here are one and the same video. I ordered both from here and at first I thought I had accidentally put the wrong DVD in twice. Basically I paid for the same product twice...rather upset that one of the two of these channels couldnt foot the bill to put out their own documentary. This may have jaded me.In a nutshell this is a decent primer on feudal Japan and the samurai ethos. The dramatizations I found to be cheezy and I felt actually detracted from the overall documentary. Strictly B Movie fare. Dave Lowry and Stephen Turnbull are present to give their historical perspectives which is nice and the one Japanese Sensei who is a martial artist in residence at some East Coast university tries WAY to hard to be dramatic in his interview. All in all there is some good info but I felt this to be rushed and done on the cheap. I give it a B-.
4,"Should've been Called ""Nugent/Gramm""","The singer Ted uses on this album sounds like the lead singer of a Foreigner Cover band. Yes, it sounds as if Lou Gramm took over the studio and told Ted this is how rock and roll should be played!"
2,"very cheap, but fits well","The belt is made out of foam, the top is beyond cheap fake leather, I did not order the XS but it is what I recieved. I ordered a M/L, but suprisingly the XS skirt fit me, the bra is TINY, so I had to send back anyways."
4,An album of innocent ingenious ahead of his time,"Julian Lennon was in pushed into the music business before he was ready. To make an album at such a young age dealing with a close death is a courageous act indeed. Julian has grown up struggling with criticism and other injustices. Though all, his shine is there and future pieces can only suprise you. Fighting the music business and inner conflicts at the same time can gradually lead only to success! I look forward to future plans and if not, this album holds a lot of introspect on a life filled to the brim with talent."
4,Dated followup to 2001,"The basic plot of this film is so dated, with the evil Soviets and crazy Americans squared off in a repeat of the Cuban Missle Crisis, that the only real reason to watch this film is the acting and effects. The effects are so-so with the mats being the most obvious example. The Blue-ray brings this out, since you can see the outlines of the moving elements more clearly. The acting is good, especially Helen Mirren and the actors manage to convey the tension between Soviet and American sides. The ending is the clossest element to 2001.Overall, if you like the film and can accept the Soviet-American tension as a plot, the Blue Ray version is the way to go. The picture is soft - as is typical of films of the 1980's - but the details are easier to pick up in the Blue Ray than the old DVD."
3,not my cup of tea but a good movie,this movie was a good movie I thought it was funny the USSR was our enemy in 2010 but this movie was made in 1980 I hope everyone is just as scared as the return of the USSR as me lol this movie made sence where 2001 made no sence you can skip 2001 and enjoy this movie if anything seeing how much 2001 sucked made me like this movie even more I just can't give it more then 3 stars
1,An abomination to 2001 - I can't believe how bad this movie was!,"2010: The Year We Make Contact [Blu-ray]This movie should NEVER have been made, period! This was a blind buy and a regret, sold the next day. It is basically the exact opposite of 2001. Everything that was cool about 2001, this movie makes cheap and ugly. It looks like they filmed it on the ""set of 2001"" instead of the actual spaceship, like 2001 appeared to be filmed on. The whole movie looked cheap and dialogue is borderline moronic. Special effects were terrible and this movie is an abomination to sci-fi of which I am an avid fan. I cant believe how upset this movie made me after watching 2001 the day before, night and day difference. I'm done, thanks."
3,Great film. Stands alone or expands on 2001,"The funny thing about this film is that even though I saw it 10 years before I saw 2001, I didn't miss a single aspect of what the film had to offer. I actually enjoyed 2001 more because I'd seen 2010.The acting is not usually addressed when discussing this movie, which is odd because the cast is full of some very respectable and capable actors who turn in great performances. Roy Schneider, Helen Mirren and John Lithgow are very well supported. The story is interesting, the visuals are nice, and the tension of the ralationships and of the situation are evident in almost every scene.I actually enjoyed this more than I enjoyed 2001. Not as revolutionary or as visually stunning as its predecesor, 2010 succedes much more in conveying a story rather than a mood, and develops characters rather than settings.The disc is well put together, but could stand some extras. Overall, definately worth owning in this format."
1,2010 - The Day we made contact,I love this movie but - the video quality is not even close to being Blu-Ray quality. It is even blurry at some points. They must not have used the master - who knows.
1,the aspect ratio of this movie is crap,"if anybody decides to order this movie on DVD, make sure you order it where the DVD can play 2 versions of this movie. What I mean by what I say is that the aspect ratio of this movie is so bad you have to watch it with black bars on the top and bottom of your TV screen. This movie needs to be digitally remastered in order so that if anyone owns a new HD Digital TV, you will be able to zoom the picture out so you do not watch it with black bars on the top and bottom of your TV screen. It's like I always say, ""If you don't watch a movie in a theater with black bars on the theater screen, why should you have to watch it any other way when you buy a regular DVD for home viewing? Again, this movie either needs to be digitally remastered or change the aspect ratio to 185:1, so that those people that literally hate black bars will not have to watch this movie that way"
3,No video improvement over DVD,"I was hoping that it would be an improvement over the DVD version of this that I have, which is dark in several spots, and has a variety of camera flair and special effects errors. In otherwords I was hoping for a 'restored' edition. No such luck. The BluRay video might even be worse. My equipment is ISF calibrated. (Really good movie though, BluRay sound was clear)"
4,Very well done,"I thought that the Blu-Ray version was very well done. The most important part of the movie is right at the beginning, a text-only summary of some of the key plot elements from 2001. That text is far more readable in the Blu-Ray version than in any other, and that text is critical to understanding the beginning of the movie, especially if you haven't seen 2001. That's not the time to be making a popcorn run..."
1,Hollywood Shlock Attack,"Who thought it would be a good idea to superimpose ""Close Encounters"" on top of ""2001""? What a dumbed-down exercise in movie-making stupidity. Even Hal the Computer is dull-witted and smarmy, with a Richard Dreyfus look-alike as his programmer buddy. ""2001"" raised questions, left them unanswered, figured the audience was intelligent enough to chew them over; ""2010"" barges into the room like a loud, unloved In-law with ham-fisted, moronic answers to all those questions, tries its best to kill off any of the mystery or poetry in ""2001"" (how did they ever get the rights to use replicas of the original sets?), then stomps on the broken pieces with a bunch of New Age, Talk-To-You-From-The-Other-Side garbage. The only useful thing about this movie was that I learned the Russian word for ""idiot"" is ""durak"", which would certainly apply to everyone involved in the production of this abomination."
4,Dated classic,"Although over 150 years old and clearly somewhat dated, it is still a classic example of how to explain basic science to the general public. Even after all of this time, most of the public does not understand such basic principles of science and how the world works."
5,Some Reverence Required,"Faraday first gave a ""The Chemical History of a Candle"" in 1849.Here's part of the introduction:""And before proceeding, let me say this also: that though our subject be so great, and our intention that of treating it honestly, seriously, and philosophically, yet I mean to pass away from all those who are seniors amongst us. I claim the privilege of speaking to juveniles as a juvenile myself. I have done so on former occasions and, if you please, I shall do so again. And though I stand here with the knowledge of having the words I utter given to the world, yet that shall not deter me from speaking in the same familiar way to those whom I esteem nearest to me on this occasion.And now, my boys and girls, I must first tell you of what candles are made..."""
4,Very Useful,I recently bought this item and am very satisfied with it for many reasons. For one it was much much easier and faster to type than it was with the on-screen keyboard. While this is attached to the controller (using either the clip for the Sixaxis or the Madcatz controller which are both includind in the package) all the buttons are accesible It is comfortable to use and hold (although it makes the controller a little heavier) when just typing. If you were trying to type while playing a game this would be very awkward. The best place to have put the keyboard would have been under the analog sticks which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. One great feature about this is if you don't use the clip you can use it as a normal wireless keyboard that works with anything that is compatible with a keyboard and has a USB port like a computer or an Xbox 360.Overall this is a great product and I would recomend it to anyone.
1,Purchase with caution,"The USB light never turned green (which should indicate that it's charging). It never stops flashing red (which indicates that it's searching for a receiver). It never syncs with the thumbpad. Be careful when purchasing this item. Some have claimed success, others have not. Unfortunately for me, I'm in the ""have not"" category."
1,Does Not Work,"Many people who have purchased this item have found out that it does not work. The instructions for the device say that when the u.s.b receiver is plugged into the PS3 and the ""thumbpad"" is turned on, both lights will flash ,and then turn solid. Well, they never turn solid, and the ""thumbpad"" never works. I would like to know if anyone got this to work. Also, there is no technical support on the Mad Catz web page. I guess this is what you get for buying a third party peripheral."
1,Don't buy this,"I have purchased two fruit savers. The first one came clearly refurbished - the feet were chipped off and the manual missing. While it worked, it did a good job at extending the life time of the fruit in it. Unfortunately, it worked for only about two months, then the fan broke. I ordered a second unit, because I still liked the concept. The second unit worked for about three months, then the cooling unit broke.Overall assessment: nice idea - appalling manufacturing quality"
4,Capsule Monsters Review,"This is a fun toy, it is entertainin and I cant wait to contue collecting but I think the shipping was incredibly too slow in getting here!"
5,Takes me back to the Muppets I loved years ago,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a simple story, well told by people who really love the Muppets. The music is fun to listen to (I must confess that I am a fan of Flight of the Conchords, so, maybe a bit biased). Not as special as the original, but, as the saying goes, you can't go home again."
5,great,The muppets arrived quickly and in great shape. this was great as I purchased for a birth day present last minute.
1,How can so many people like this. I Think a 5 year old wrote it,"Waste of time, ridiculous story line. Some may get a chuckle at the comically bad script but I am amazed at how many people are giving this glowing reviews. I think nostalgia is clouding their minds."
1,What Was That?,"I'd never seen a Muppets movie before but I knew the characters from when I was younger. Who would create a kids' movie with such a grown-up theme? I really feel sorry for the actress, whose talent was well disguised in this movie. This could quite possibly be the most idiodic kids' film I've ever seen. From now on I'll choose more wisely."
3,"Cute, clever, slightly bland but clean and fun","I have been a fan of the Muppets for ages, and this new movie is indeed fun for the whole family. At times it was a bit slow moving, but I liked the cameos, songs, and playful puns. I'm not sure if this version will qualify as a classic or not, but it is one you should watch at least once to visit with all of your favorite characters. I used to think Miss Piggy was my favorite but I am drawn to both Kermit and Sweetums now! All of the muppets are so cute! The bad guy is a little corny and his song is my least favorite. I did like his henchmen muppets though because they are lovable. PS What happened to Amy Adams? She looks really drawn, old, and bland in this movie...which surprised me...it is like she lost her luster as a star...."
3,For a Muppets fan-I was disappointed,"When I first heard they were going to do a new film I was happy. The last film Muppet film I did not care for.I like Amy Adams but her role here is a stereo type of the girlfriend role. Oscar nominated 3 times, she could have phoned the performance in.Was glad to see all my favorite characters. Did we care of how Piggy looked in the film-not really.Too bad they could not get some celebrities that had appeared on the show or in the earlier movies. Jack Black? Bottom of the barrel huh?Won an Oscar for the song. Slow year for music. Reusing songs in the soundtrack. Not talking about Muppet songs but AC-DC & others? Tacky.Extras are ok-all extras like bloopers & making of of course are staged.I will not be doing the digital download for the film nor soundtrack.An OK film-just could have been better."
1,Appalling!,"This movie was appalling! Since when do Muppets fart?! I honestly don't know what Disney were thinking, but stick with the originals -- these stuffed shirts are Muppets-In-Name-Only."
5,The Muppets,"It's time to meet the Muppets.It's 2011 and the Muppets have been gone for a long time (since 2005), but anyways, they make their grand comeback in this excellent movie! The Muppets is filled with laughs and good storyline, leading to a good message. The Muppets is one of the best family movie I've seen all year and Jason Segal & Amy Adam do a fantastic job in this amazing movie! A+"
2,huge Muppet Fan,I'm a huge fan of the Muppets and really looked forward to watching this movie. I kept waiting for it to get better....... but it never did. Really disappointed
2,"Good Movie, but False Advertising","I purchased the Wocka Wocka value pack for my children due to the inclusion of a movie soundtrack. Based on the outside packaging, it appears that CD soundtrack is included. However, a code is given for a download from the Disney website. You have to become a Disney Rewards member if not already, and then you can download a Zip file of the soundtrack. For us the, we had to try 3 different programs to find one that would actually open the file. We have still been unable to burn a CD of the soundtrack, and currently can only listen to it from our computer. It's a pretty disappointing purchase for us, and I wish we had just bought the regular movie version only."
4,Kids love it!,"So, I must first say, I am NOT a Muppet Fan, and I did not enjoy this movie. But My 35 year old husband and my 6 and 3 years old absolutely can't get enough of this move. My 3 year old little boy runs around the hosue singing the songs from this movie to himself. If you aren't already a Muppet fan, you probably won't like this... but if you are then you will!"
2,I honesty didn't get this movie,"I'm 46. Grew up with the Muppets. I love them. I didn't like this movie and honestly I don't understand what other people like about it. It's not a good movie at all. The only thing it has going for it is nostalgia. As a movie the story is weak, the music numbers with minor exceptions are super flat. I went in expecting awesome from all the hype. I would have been happy if it was just so-so but for me it was just bad. Bad writing, bad story, bad music. Nothing.Maybe I'll watch it again in 10 years and change my opinion. I want to be believe though that rather, all the people that like it now will watch in again in 10 years and wonder what they were thinking."
1,Picture Quality,"I would not recommend purchasing the ""HD"" version of this movie. I paid an extra $2.00 to upgrade quality and was very disappointed. The picture was blurry and I could even make out the individual block pixels, something that should be unheard of with respect to HD."
1,A Groan Thing,We saw the trailer for this movie on another DVD rental and it looked like it was going to be a great comedy. Unfortunately the trailer contains all of the laughs. The guy who edited the trailer deserves an Oscar and then be shot. We wanted to like this one. We tried twice make it through the whole movie and couldn't make it either time. It was that bad. No it was worse. The lead actor is so over the top and stupid that he rendered the movie unwatchable all by himself. I can't imagine what James Brolin had to say to Barbara when he screened this one for her. Hopefully the paycheck was really big. Other than Stiles we have to say: Terrible acting - Awful Script - Insipid Humor. What a disappointment!
2,nothing new,"There is nothing new about this movie. Actually, it was pretty boring. My boyfriend and I walked out in the middle of it. The story has been repeated over and over in other movies and the humor .....or the lack of it...is much more to be desired."
1,Stupid!!!!!!!!!!!,It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would never recommend this movie. Don't Buy this movie it is a waste of time and money.
3,It's not THAT bad,"The plot: Basically, Jason Lee is preparing to get married to Selma Blair until he meets Selma Balir's cousin (Julia Stiles). The whole movie revolves around Jason Lee trying to avoid Julia Stiles so Selma Blair doesn't think he has the hots for her cousin.Okay, I admit the script was pretty weak in this movie, but that doesn't mean it wasn't funny. Personally, I liked a few of the jokes, and I got a good laugh out of this. Julia Stiles is what makes the movie watchable because she makes her character, Becky, interesting to watch. Basically, Stiles is what makes this movie watchable because she gets this movie rolling along.All in all, if you were interested in seeing this movie, go ahead and rent it and see what you think. Just don't expect a lot from this movie, as with most movies out there."
3,Pretty crude but funny too..,"is the best way to describe this film. None of the characters are very multi-dimensional and were it not for the language and a few parts of the subject matter, you would think you are viewing a television sitcom.Much of the humor is obvious and sometimes the movie strains for credibility, but it was overall an entertaining film. There are some parts in it that show comedic genius, while others resort to the humor of fourth grade school children.As a fan of Earl Nightingale, I was pleased to see a part of his famous work, ""The Strangest Secret"" in this movie. What was never made clear is why the character was listening to Seattle's ""Dr. Earl"" in the first place, or how it affected him. It was just sort of stuck in there for no real purpose.Still, the movie has some real funny parts that make up for the others which are less than great."
5,My son's absolute favourite!,"This is a book my 21-month old 'reads' (either with me or on his own) again and again, and he laughs the whole way through it every time!He's memorized which animal is in each hiding place and can just about recite the entire book without lifting the flaps, and enjoys it even more when I make the animal sounds to go with the pictures!I've bought copies for my friends' babies, and we now have copies at each of the grandparents' houses as well!"
4,Love this movie!,"I love the movie and would give it 5 stars but the DVD has no extra features so the movie is 5 stars but the DVD its self is 4 stars. This movie is a little older (Early 90's) But I've watched it from way back when. It's a movie I had on vidio and watch it so much that the tape started to warp. (But I watch movies while I work on things where most people play music.) I like romantic comadies and I love the inxs music, but I don't know if younger generations would agree. I could tell you that my older brother and my mom liked this movie back when I first got the VHS but that was probly in 1997. Hope this helped."
3,Mystery Date 3/5,The title explains it all. Mystery Date is about a young man(ethan hawke) who falls in love with his next door neighbor. His older brother encoureges him to invite her out for a night on the town. But things suddenly take a turn for the worst when he discovers a body in the trunk of his brother's car.P.S. notice the costume dwelling rock band. It's Gwar!
1,Time consuming and difficult to manipulate,"I struggled with this software for a couple of weeks then gave up. I'm no rookie-I am familiar with AutoCAD, Access, Excel, Word, Adobe Photoshop, Powerpoint, Project etc etc and this program just didnt seem to follow any of the rules. Realizing that a 3D image(incidentally there was no house template anything like mine) was going to take about as long as it took to landscape a garden, I tried 2D-hoping to superimpose walls and vegetation on a photo of my house...hours later i still couldnt easily construct the scene.If this were any other type of product, I would be retuning it for a refund-but with software you dont get to take it back.....so unless you want to spend many hours in front of your computer-rather than in the yard I suggest you pass on this."
1,Too ambitious and inaccurate,"I do not wish to put down the effort of creating such a tome. However, throughout, the authors' show a blindness and narrowness of mind. Real scholorship is hard to come by in the martial arts world. This book attempts it but does not make the mark."
2,Disappointed,"As a fan of David Decocteaus films The Brotherhood trilogy, Voodoo Academy and others I was very excited to see Wolves of Wall Street. However, I was very disappointed. Everything that made the previous films so campy and great are completely gone. This film takes itself way to seriously. It's about a young man who gets a job on Wall Street and then is turned into a werewolf, but we never get to see any werewolves. They all remain in human form acting like werewolves. Theres no blood, no scares, nothing. There's only one scene with guys in their underwear which David has made his trademark in all of his previous films. The only thing that it has going for it is the acting. The acting is by far the best of his films, thanks in part to Elisa Donavan from Clueless and Sabrina and Eric Roberts, an acadmey award nominated actor."
4,Finally! A book I can truly use with my class!,"Mr. Blevins has written an easy to understand and use reference for primary level teachers! My copy is already becoming worn because I'm actually USING it! I use the large collections of lists of words quite often! I will be investigating this author's other works as his style and ideas are actually usable in a REAL classroom! ~""Educational jargon"" free!"
1,This is the wrong movie,This movie is NOT the Los Asesinos (1968) that stars Nick Adams. The rest of the names mentioned on the DVD cover are NOT the actors in the Nick Adams' film.
3,OK,"Another wacky Jim Carey picture, that 20-million dollar a picture guy who gets his share of laughs and no doubt makes his producers happy, but this guy is capable of deeper stuff. A little tripish."
1,Moronic,"This formulaic, ham-handed, simple-minded, asinine piece of tripe--which feels like it grew out of some stale focus groups composed on 8th grade drop-outs--will probably make a few million bucks. It's the kind of drivel that makes you wish that some great asteroid would wipe out Hollywood, leaving behind nothing but a twenty square mile circle of charcoal.Please don't see this garbage. Don't give these rich, fat, coarse, and tasteless boors the satisfaction of having ripped you off and gotten a new Roll Royce out of your foolishness.I got my money back. Demanded it. Explained why. They couldn't disagree."
2,Not a bad remake,"The original movie was made with George Segal and Jane Fonda in 1977 and is much better. But this remake has been updated for our times in light of ENRON. And though a comedy, it does show what corporate America is doing to their employees. Though I am sure that is what the writers were trying to portray. The message gets lost in all the pratfalls that Jim Carrey is famous for.The movie is about an upwardly mobile couple that think their star is rising and find themselves unemployed and in debt. After trying to get work unsuccessfully, even as a day laborer. They are in desperate need of money so turn to robbery. I would have to say the part I liked the best is when the lawn gets reposed. Jim and Tea make a believable couple and that is a big plus for the movie. It is worth watching, but if you have a choice, I'd pick up the original."
3,Not so fun the second time around.,"Fun with Dick and Jane starring Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni is a movie that just never got off the ground for me. The leads are a hoot and completely talented but the script does nothing to show how funny they are. I am so tired of Alec Baldwin, he is in every freakin' movie and t.v. show, who said he could act!? The original flim is so more unique and funnier. It's a shame this movie was such a disappontment, I was expecting so much more. The beginning and ending of the film were such a letdown but I am giving this movie three stars 'cause I love the leads and the middle of the movie did have some standout moments. This is a so-so flim so you be the judge of it."
2,Fun with Dick & Jane 2005,"When Dick Harper (Jim Carey 1962- ) is termined as gladonyne Corporations VP of Communication , he assures his wife Jane (T?a Leoni 1966- ) , hell find another job in no time .Months later their lawn is repossessed , Jane has sold her body to science , and Dicks career as a day laborer ends with his deportation to Mexico . Madder than ever and not going to take it anymore , Dick and Jane turn to the faste-growing sector in the White-collar job market-armed robbery -as they become upscale suburban Robin Hood , stealing from the rich and giving to the poor..namely themselves ! . Silly plot and boring movie ! , You been warned !"
3,Fun With Dick And Jane DVD,"Honestly, I didn't think I'd enjoy this movie much. So much of Jim Carrey's stuff for me is hit and miss with my sense of humor. This one pleasantly surprised me with many unexpected funny scenes.Alec Baldwin always does a great job at portraying someone you want to hate, and does so again as the greedy, corporate top executive who makes it rich at the expense of the average guy.I didn't like the portrayal of turning to robbery and justifying it in desperate circumstances as being a reasonable and fun option. Their characters were very shallow and vain when in the down and outs, but I guess this movie's intent wasn't to show character in the first place.I guess overall I'd rate it as so-so. Funny parts but probably not one I'd watch again.Saturday Night Live - Best of Alec Baldwin"
3,"Enjoyable, but nothing great.","This is an okay movie if you want to leave your brains at the door and just be amused for a couple of hours. Yes, Jim Carrey has a tendency to overact, but it's not so bad in this movie. I found some of the scenes to be quite funny, while others dragged a bit and seemed pointless. I enjoyed watching Tea Leoni and thought that Alec Baldwin's role was perfect for him."
2,Cool Whip.....,"It was cute and it was entertaining for the short time this movie lasts, but no ""Wedding Crashers."""
3,The Robbersons,"Mild social comedy with good performances by the luscious Tea Leoni (will she ever again have as good a role as she had in ""Flirting with Disaster?"") and Jim Carrey (in a controlled, sad-sack performance).There is a mild attempt at social commentary but basically this is a story about how many American couples are living beyond their means and that if should one or both lose their jobs...they end up living in their cars or worse.Though ""FWDAJ"" is basically a comedy there is a deep sense of sadness underlying this story: rather than admit their financial woes, sell their luxury home and make a go at living within their now limited means...they turn to crime.What does that say about our Society and more importantly what does that say about Us?"
4,Not a bad heating pad at all,"This is my first ""real"" heating pad although I've made plenty of the homemade rice-filled socks and whatnot. I wanted something that would last a long time with even heat but didn't have any odor or danger of burning my skin. This one fits the bill, the heat is penetrating but doesn't bother your skin -- I think the flannel cover is very helpful in protecting it from that. The only thing is that the actual heated part is in a plastic ""wrapper,"" and it is not only crinkly and rather bothersome but looks like it might tear/break...? Also, the flannel cover closes with Velcro and it's already starting to fuzz and weaken. Anyway, for $10 I've gotten my money's worth and will continue using until it eventually wears out."
2,huh?,"Shuggie lost me on this one. Im all for experimentation and branching out,but the tunes here left me clueless. If your gonna get with the funk,get the funk out. Just when you think, hey, here's a song,it gets all muddled.There is some redemption with the song ""Sweet Thang"", which is a really sweet slow groove, but thats about it folks. With Inspiration Information Shuggie Otis become somewhat the Syd Barrett of the blues."
1,The Emperor isn't wearing any clothes...,"THE EMPEROR ISN'T WEARING ANY CLOTHES! I think you all are getting a bit confused here...I bought Shuggie's record because people like Sean O'Hagan and David Byrne are on the sleeve giving it praise (last time I do that) and because all the cool people are talking about it...lost treasure time I thought. Wrong! This pedestrian lp could have been by just about any forgotten 70s musician...I don't hear anything but some decent guitar and simple lyrics. Close your eyes and grab anything in your local used record store's ""Soul"" section and you are likely to find something as good as this... Sorry hipsters, you've be hood winked."
3,Don't belive the hype,"There was a lot of talking about how great this album is, so i end up buying it.In the end, it turned out to be a really nice album, nothing less and nothing more.My guess is, that all the hype around this CD was created buy peoples who never heard Soul/Funk before, and don't know who Sly Stone is, because I can think of much better records that where done by much better artists and sound much more fresh today than this one."
5,Great soul,Sounds to me like a cross between Jimi Hendrix and early Sly & The Family Stone. Very cool stuff.
1,psychoanalytic dribble,"Come into this century please! What a waste of money. I really thought/hoped I would get some treatment recommendations for a narcissistic child in therapy. There was nothing useful in this book, not even her diatribal defense of psychoanalysis."
3,Montgomery's best,"R.A. Montogmery could never equal the mastery of the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" genre that Edward Packard did. Too often his books were preachy and overly arbitrary. This book may be his best effort, however, telling a fairly gripping series of adventures of your search for the lost city of Atlantis. The series was new and fresh at this point, and many of its best books were among its first nine."
3,This book was fun and adventure packed!,In my opinion I would like to recommend this book to anyone who hates reading.This book takes place in the deep Atlantic in the lost city of Atlantis. In this book you are the character. What happens in the book is that you are an underwater explorer. This is your biggest mission. You must find the lost city of Atlantis.
2,Look elsewhere,"In one word: BOO!. The cover and editor/publisher description are very misleading. If the phrase in detail means look in the man pages then it the descriptions would be correct. This book professes to cover in detail much but delivers little. For instance, it claims to describe configuring window managers such as kde and fvwm. It shows a screen shot and says refer to the info/man pages for how to configure them. This style of coverage is consistent throughout the book. Instead of showing page after page of output from the make command when compiling packages the space could have been put to use providing the details promised. I would have returned this book had I not been so stupid as to remove the cd for safekeeping. Where the book does give some details it is often incorrect. An example is stating the swap partition limit is 64M when it is 127. Terms are frequently misused such as stating multithreading is accomplished with the fork call. Much promise, little value."
2,look for another book,"this book is basicly a print ot of the man pages, the slackware cd thats comes with this book is corroupt, and there lots of formatting problems. for instance html tags how up in the syntax descriptions of sed commands. dont buy this book."
1,Defective CD - Do not buy this,"Don't buy this. Unless something seriously has changed, the CD distributed with this book is defective-- it will not install. Period. The technical support from Sam's from this has been ""download the distribution from www.slackware.com"", which is not a satisfactory answer. After begging a bit they *did* send me a new disk. A shame. This is a disservice to the Slackware Linux community."
2,"Outdated, inaccurate information","While I find the DK/Eyewitness travel guides excellent for European cities, the new one on Washington, DC doesn't live up to the usual standard. I live and work in DC, and know the city and its attractions very well. There were several inaccuracies in the book; most glaring was the misinformation about the Portrait Gallery and National Museum of American Art. These museums are currently closed for a 3-4 year renovation project, but you'll find that according to the DK guide, they're open for business! Hopefully, revised editions will correct such errors, and expand the scope of the book into some of DC's wonderful neighborhoods (Cleveland Park, Shaw, Brookland) that weren't covered in this first edition."
1,Dark and depressing,"Child pornography without the pictures. This is NOTHING like McCall Smith's other books. One wonders if the editorial reviewers who found it so light and touching actually read it. In one story a man hires a child who has been forced into prostitution, in another a woman stuck in a loveless marraige chooses a sickening way out and seduces a high school student. In another, a woman tricks her date into entering a crocodile's lair in a zoo and he dies. It's a disturbing book that I regret buying and can not bring myself to even finish."
1,No English Subtitles?? Why Not?!?,"Us old folks that can remember a ""living"" Marilyn likely need subtitles by now! But these rip-off studios don't care!! Love MM but hate cheap DVD producers! 5 stars for MM and 0 stars for cheap productions!"
2,Subtitles,Bought this set as a gift. Recipient was very disappointed with the subtitles. Tried several different DVD players but none could turn off the subtitles. Amazon should have included this information in the description.
1,RIDICULOUS,The game itself is good. As far as the glitches it has; totally unacceptable! I am talking every time I play the game it locks up. They need to re issue with better quality. EA sports needs to fire whoever came out with this game.
4,Great music,Good music.... liked it very much specially Mustang Sally... i gifted it to my friend who just bought Mustang...and he was happy to receive it too.
3,Not for the Beginning Pianist. If your gifted maybe.,I just started learning to play piano when I bought this book used and after trying to wade through it for about 3 wks. had to set it down as it got to frustrating for me. Many of the examples given involve the playing of many flat or sharp keys (the black keys) and long stretches of the fingers. If more of the examples were in the key of C I probably would had faired better. I'm determined to get through this book. I recently picked it back up again. I would say that if you are at least an intermediate player it should go well for you. It also gets into quite a lot of theory. I will probably end up transposing the written material in the key of C and maybe G so that I will be able to play the examples at an acceptable tempo.
3,Good but some stories way too long.,"The stories are interesting especially the one ""Cousins"" and there are some good anecdotes, but overall it was just OK."
4,Above Average,"This is a pretty good screenplay to a pretty good movie. Interesting fact: it isn't the final version. In fact, there are a lot of differences. But simply put: if you like Michael Crichton's novels, you will like this, as it has more of his trademark realistic science and suspense. However, the plot is somewhat cliched, and the ending is pretty weak, hence my four stars."
3,My son was not as interested in this one as the others..,"My son loves Alvin and the Chipmunks and has watched the other two movies, from start to finish, multiple times.I thought this movie was cute, however it did not seem to keep his attention at all like the previous two did.I am not sure why, but he was just very (unusually) uninterested in this Chipmunk adventure."
2,New? or a fake copy?,"This appears to be a copy that someone made. I bought this as a gift, so it is still in shrinkwrap, but I held the DVD next to a copy I already own and the cover art looks like it was printed off a home printer. I am surprised Amazon would sell this as a new DVD. It clearly is not from the manufacturer. I don't know yet if it works, as it is still in the wrap."
2,Did not like,Sorry my kids lost intrest in this movie 15 Min in it and walked away they are not babys tey 7 and 9
5,Great Item,Loved the movie and received the multipack for the kids at Christmas. Was able to load the digital copy into onto my vudu account and watch anywhere.
5,my son loved it!!,My son loves this movie. Got it and he hasn't stopped watching it. Thanks so much for getting it here so fast.
5,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, what a fun movie. My grand kids, ages 4 and 6 really enjoy the songs and action of this movie. They really liked the treasure and volcano. We have to keep watching it over again and keep seeing things we have missed. Good family time movie."
4,Chipwrecked is Cool,As a veteran of frame by frane cartoon animation (think Yogi Bear or Popeye) I was impressed by the computer animation in this movie. It was so fast in spots I almost could not follow it. Loved the Munks and their adventure. Great Family film.
1,Did'nt even finish watching,This movie is so bad we couldn't get through the whole thing. My four year old was'nt interested at all. I want my rental fee back.
3,Product is probably good but I needed a blower for a right hand drive jeep.,I chose this rating because this was the wrong motor to meet my needs. It will most likely work well on a left hand drive jeep.
3,Could be better,"While I had high hopes that this would be the ultimate phone for my home office, I am still seeking perfection.Pros: cordless signal is clear and reception is fantastic, plenty of features, does not interfere with my 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi, has proven reliable after ~6mos of useCons: speakerphone is too quiet, headset jack is not designed to work well with standard headsets (even when I use a top notch cell phone headset people complain that they can't hear anything)"
3,"Patchy, but intriguing","Ms Kennedy has here produced a disquieting, serious book. Our on-the-shelf heroine leaves her home to care for an aged relative, and stumbles on a years-old mystery involving a missing child and the repercussions for the family of the alleged murderer. The mystery is skilfully plotted, the minor characters well-drawn and used, but the hero and heroine never quite emerge from their respective roles in the plot - the romance is relegated to the backseat while the hero deals with his social alienation and the heroine solves the mystery.The mystery is absolutely compelling, however, and Ms Kennedy, despite this somewhat patchy effort, remains one of the better writers in the genre."
1,Very limited.,"The pre-created templates are predominantly ugly and unappealing.Creating one of your own is easy enough, but in saving item, I was very disappointed that the page couldn't be saved as a jpg or other photo format. Only being able to save in scrapbooking format or pdf is a very poor design idea.I had really hoped for something better."
3,way too wordy,"DeMille is an excellent writer and I liked a lot of his other books, but this really needed a good editor to excise about one third of the verbiage.It is a compelling yarn, but the first of his I have read that is devoid of any humor. His characters are usually very funny, and even though the plot is a tragedy, it could have used some lightening up.About 2/3 of the way through, I began skipping through the pages of long, tiresome descriptions to where some action started again. A disappointment."
5,Awesome!,"This great story lets the reader into the minds of the characters on each side of the seige. DeMille has a way of making you care about each of the characters (good and bad). He even does a good job of giving life to most of the supporting characters. His characters are great, the dialog is top notch (as always), and his setting is amazing. I've never seen St. Patricks Cathedral, but DeMille made it very easy to visualize it (the diagrams in the front were a great touch).I've always described reading a DeMille book as watching a movie in your mind. This one is no exception. The action and suspence are great. If you can, read the last section in one sitting. It will be worth it, and I bet you won't be able to put it down at that point anyway.Also recommend Plum Island, and Jeffery Deaver's The Devil's Teardrop and A Maiden's Grave."
5,high quality; reasonable price... just what I was looking for,"not much to say; if you're looking for a product with these specifications, avoid the cheap garbage out there; you get what you pay for and this is totally worth it"
5,Both Awesome and Intrinsic,"Dowling's skill shines in these 12 short stories of horror, fantasy and science fiction. From the thrill and the shock of The Bullet that Grows the Gun, to the dread and the wonder of Scaring the Train, Dowling weaves his magic as a storyteller.Significant to this collection of short stories is Dowling's connecting narrative, spanning a 12 hour evening, from dusk till dawn.Truly a significant mind in Australia's literary circles."
2,Dumb,"Overall, I did not care for this movie.There are some very good things about it though. The music is great and there are some very funny scenes in it. John Malkovich does an excellent job with the two different personalities - the android and the doctor.The acting of the other actors is very poor though and overall the movie was corny and pretty dumb."
3,Good but overpriced,"If you like Paul Bowen pictures, buy ""Executive Jets"" by Geza Szurovy, not this one. That book only costs about fourteen dollars and it's way better printed and layed out. (Believe it or not.) Why is it that when I look at the pictures in this book in artifical lighting they look better than they do in full sunlight? I can't quite figure this out. It's an interesting question, because I had to evaluate it in a bookstore, not where I peruse many photo-folios, in full sunlight. Despite it's price, the quality of reproduction is not there. It makes me a little uneasy to think that I didn't quite get what I thought I was getting.The photos in this collection are not the best work of Bowen, to judge from the Szrovy book, which concentrates only on turbine-powered aircraft.Who picked the shots? They're bland and predictable, except for one picture of a Lear climbing nearly vertically into the sky.There are few full-bleed pictures, so why is this book so expensive?"
2,looking for,this is not what i was looking for. but my kids seem to like it but not me. would like to see something better
4,El Destino (The Destination),"I grew up in the Monticello, Florida area and I am very familiar with El Destino Plantation. I am also an avid reader of ALL books on Florida, fiction and non-fiction. Mr. Martin transports his readers back to antebellum days. His descriptions of the historical figures and life on a plantation are excellent. This would be a wonderful book for middle school and high school students interested in the era. Most readers will be surprised that the old south plantation system was alive and well in north Florida."
1,Phil roy grouchyfriendly,"Terrible, awful, unsettling and unfreindly. Not a good CD, don't waste your money. If you listened to ""melt"" and you're buying based upon that song (which is the only redeeming quality) stop yourself immediately. The CD drags you through 14 additional songs at an absolute snails pace. A lot of incoherent babbling throughout. I only wish I would have read this review and not wrote it."
1,Not as Good as Staedtler,"I got this set based on price as a replacement for my finished Staedtler non-photo blue pencils. These are still non-photo blue but they are almost a different shade. Enough to clash with my current work. Additionally, I find the Staedtlers smoother in application. I use these for sketching and portraiture. If you're interested in a good non-photo blue pencil look at the Staedtler 0 31901 model without eraser. Common pink eraser heads fit over them snugly and they work flawlesly. If you're looking at any non-photo blue, these Prismacolor ones aren't terrible though. Also, the Prismacolors erase easier."
2,Just OK For Me.....,"Yet another kids take a roadtrip movie and find themselves lost flick. Although some of these type movies can and are very good, this one is not all that good. As you would expect, the kids happen upon a gas station where they are warned of impending danger. Although I must say that the opening scene where the chick gets killed by a man with a hook for a hand was cool. The kids happen upon inbred killers who kill some of them with the rest worrying for their lives. There is gore and some good killing scenes, I have to say. But I'll never understand the comparison to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies! for no movie can come close!! I would maybe compare this film to Wrong Turn if I had to compare it to another film but I must say Wrong Turn was a Great film compared to this one. Just OK in my book."
1,im so glad this got a low rating,"this was a very poor poor experience. and it was worth the low rating. ultra repetitive scenes, nauseating insipid scenes of people sleeping on the beach, and wow we get to see the same scenes but in a different video effect. let the music do the looping, dont loop the same images. in fact, never do that again. or do a entire video on people bumming on the beach. need people talking, what r the stores like down there, culture? ive never been."
4,Body Pillow,"This is a light-density, pliable body pillow. It is soft and comfortable and fits nicely in a standard body pillow cover; however, this will hide the nice color."
5,This really is pretty,I bought some of this to cover a window that looks directly into my neighbors house. It really blocks the view and looks great with the sun shinning through it. I took the advice of some to the other reviewers and cut bigger than I needed then cut off the extra when it was up. I did not have any problems putting it on the window. I cleaned the glass really well and then used a spray bottle to wet the glass with water. It worked like a charm. The little squeegee they sent with took care of any bubbles. I wish they made bigger sheets as I have large windows. Other than that I love it.
3,Okay greatest hits collection but needs more songs,"If you're new to Foreigner I would recommend getting the Complete Greatest Hits CD over this cause there's more songs to choose from and if I was the one that had to choose the songs from this CD, I would choose Feels Like the First Time, Cold as Ice, Headknocker, Long Long Way From Home, At War With the World, Double Vision, Blue Morning Blue Day, Hot Blooded, Love Has Taken its Toll, Dirty White Boy, Head Games, Women, Rev on the Red Line, Love on the Telephone, Urgent, Waiting For a Girl Like You, Break it Up, Juke Box Hero, Luanne and Woman in Black. I think that this would be a perfect greatest hits compilation if they would've done it that way but I give this CD 3.5 stars overall."
2,Huxley's Early Novel Antic Hay,"Antic Hay is Huxley writing in a heavy, self conscious style, where characters are like Greek characters on stage. Pared down, it would be a great play, but Huxley's need to press upon the reader his social/political ideas isn't the easiest to wade through. What is it about? In early works, Huxley struggles with dead Victorian values in the face of a new young 20th century leisure class, and the new modernism of the political and social change of the post WWI era. There is a class of educated idle rich, but they do not affect meaningful, permanent change in the world like the idealized Socialist upstart. Huxley over analyzes the world of the character in this novel. Antic Hay observes from a distance the new world order. It is a tornado of a novel."
3,Somewhat helpful,"The comprehension questions and vocabulary lists were helpful, but I was looking for more creative ideas. I had never taught The Westing Game before, so using this guide and some online resources combined helped me organize a unit."
3,The Westing Game,"I chose this book because when I read the outside cover, I thought it would be an interesting book. This book is about sixteen tenants who are tricked into playing a game about someone who isn't really dead. Turtle was my favorite character because she was the main character and she is involved in just about everything. My favorite part was when Turtle went in the Westing House because of a bet between her and one of the other tenants."
2,A Complete Letdown,"I will admit, I couldn't put down the book through the first 150 pages. I couldn't really figure it out, but I supposed that all of my questions would be answered at the end of the book.Was I wrong or what?! I expected a short, sharp, and clever end to this book. What I got was a dull,long, and just plain DUMB ending. Does Ellen Raskin think that you can never just have a straight-up ending to a book? You know, find the culprit and then answer the questions? But no, she has to throw in a million twists that are just plain dumb. I was so mad at this book that I wanted to tear it into a million pieces. What was Ellen Raskin thinking? The last part is a letdown. Dont read this if you want to be disappointed.PS- Whoever said that this was better than Harry Potter must be on something"
2,Where is the story??,"They claim this book is a mystery. Yes, there are clues and hints and wordplay but where is the storyline? Bad writing, unsatisfying beginning, middle, and end. People kept telling me to read it because supposedly it got good at the end. The most I can say is that it god kinda-good during the LAST 10 pages!! Not a good book."
2,Blah,"Someone in my son's book club chose this book and it sounded interesting, so I got a copy and previewed it before I gave it to him. Wow - it was really boring. I finished it, because I wanted to see what he was going to read, but it was a struggle. The characters are quirky and somewhat interesting, but there are too many of them- it's distracting and doesn't allow for much character exploration. I don't know what else I can say except it just wasn't engaging - the plot was not that mysterious and I didn't really care if they solved the mystery or not.I gave the book to my son and he couldn't get through it. Every day after his assigned reading time he would complain, ""But it's sooooo boring!!"" and beg to be allowed to stop reading it. I finally agreed to stop torturing him, so he never finished it. This is a kid who can lose himself for hours in a good book - Harry Potter, anything by Roald Dahl, Carl Hiaasen, Jean DuPrau, etc."
5,Intelligent Mystery with a lot of humor,"THE WESTING GAME is an intelligent mystery packed with a great deal of humor. The dialog is snappy (my husband said it reminds him of CATCH-22), and the characters are entertaining. The book clips along at a brisk pace, and so many things are happening that it's impossible to get bored.Basic plot: A group of people are gathered together at the mansion of a deceased tycoon and are divided into groups, given sporadic clues, with the opportunity to win a great deal of money if they can find out who killed Sam Westing.The book is a madcap adventure, a stunning mystery (with plenty of clues and red herrings), and a wildly entertaining comedy. One feature that I especially liked was that the author included what happened when everyone ""lived happily ever after.""I would recommend this book to: any kid who wants to be entertained, any parent who wants to interest her child in reading, any person who likes quality children's literature."
3,the surprise!,"The book, Westing Game,was a funny book yet with a twist of mystery. The book has tons of main charecters. Some of the more important ones would be the 16 nieces and nehews. The book started out with the death of Sam Weasting. The 16 heirs move to the same house and the lawyer reads the will and it ends up being a game. The winner gets $200 million dollers. The will said that one of the heirs killed him. So You have to read the book to find out who killed Westing Laugh!!!!"
5,Seven years,"I first read The Westing Game when I was in fifth grade. I am now a senior in high school, and I still read it frequently. The intricate story and tapestry of characters never ceases to amaze me, even when I know how the story ends. Expertly written, I have yet to find a single loophole in the plot."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I'd heard of this book for a while, knew it was a puzzle book, and thought I'd read it because I enjoy puzzle books. However, the main puzzle about the clues left by Westing went on far too long, especially when it was pretty obvious where the clues were leading. I found the race, sex and disability stereotypes very off-putting. Maybe the ideas were cutting edge for the time in which the book was written, but the stereotypes made the book seem very dated to me."
4,"16 heirs, a will, and a whole lot of great writing!","The Westing Game is a ""murder"" mystery that isn't solved by an inestigation or anything like that, but by a game, Sam Westing's game.I thought it was pretty good, but, it was kind of confusing with all the characters. I found it interesting how all 16 heirs have something to do with Sam Westing. It was cool how all the characters start playing the game very determined to win the $20 million Mr. Westing has left behind, and they are somewhat independent, but, they soon create a special bond with their partners. I'm not going to write anymore because I want you to go read it. It was an extremely interesting book.-Alexa,SPS"
2,Too Much Head Hopping,"This book was exhausting to try to read. Not for me! The author head hops so much, and moves from character to character without breaks, that I spent way too much time re-reading to figure out who on earth was speaking or interacting. There are way too many characters to try to keep track of and it was boring, they were boring. Nothing pulled me and tied me to the characters or caused me to want to find out the ""mystery"". There needed to be much more excitement to keep me reading this book. I'm surprised this is a classic."
4,The West Side Game,I thought The Westing Game was great because it kept me on the edge of my seat with every sentence of every chapter. The story kept me reading with the excellent suspense usage Ellen Raskin used. The only part I found difficult was to keep up with the sixteen characters. There was a lot going on at once. If you love an excellent mystery book The Westing Game is definitely your type of book. The Westing Game was one of the greatest mysteries I've ever read and I really enjoyed reading it.
3,A Mystery Not To Be Missed,"The westing game is an adventurous book. though it is a little hard to follow, it is a great book. The book is a challange to find heirs, murderers and some excrutiatingly gruesome and cruel plots. This book is an amazing book, butit is a little hard to follow because there are many ""puzzle pices"" to the mystery. The characters are very confusing, and the pairs of people and clues are too. But once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad and it's easier to follow.Ellen Raskin was very good at describing the parts of the book (almost too well) and the points of veiws of the characters. Ellen didn't do a great job separating the characters from each other. This book was my seccond favorite book. The only thing that hung this under Skeleton Key was the jumpyness and hard-to-follow characters. Only you hold all the clues to this exciting and wacko mystery!"
3,I think it was an ok book.,"My name is T.D. and I will review the Westing Game by Ellen Raskin.In the Westing Game, the heirs of Sam Westing must find who killed him. They play the Westing Game in SunSet Towers.In the end though Sandy McSouthers was Sam Westing. He was never murdered.All of the heirs were bieng accused of the murderer, but in the end, there was no one. In the end Turtle wins and she inherits the Chairman of the Board"
4,A Mystery With a Twisy,This book is called The Westing Game. It's about the murder of Samuel W. Westing. The setting is at Sunset Towers in a town called Westington. Westington is in Michigan. Sixteen unlikely people gather for the reading of his will. The reading of the will occurs in the house on the hill (Sam Westing's old house).
1,This book is all over the place,"I read this book along with my son who was required to read The Westing Game for his 7th grade Language Arts class. I enjoy books very much and I like all kinds of different books- as long as it is a good story. The Westing Game was here, there and everywhere. It was difficult to follow and not interesting enough to really care. I hung in there and completed reading the book because I thought it had to have a great ending if it was a requiured read at school. Boy was I wrong. What a waste of my time and interest. I would not recommend for anyone to read this book."
2,This book is a ripoff.......,The Westing Game was a good book until the ending when you think that you know who the murder is......it turns out he has been hiding the whole time and it was just a clay body!!!!! It keeps you thinking and when you least expect it........you change your mind then you try to change it back but you can't because there are too many clues that point to that person. If you like mystery books with a surprize ending... this is the one for you!
4,INTRIGUING READING,"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all ages. Raskins' character development is fantastic and although the abundance of characters presented a small problem with confusion, the amazing plot contemplates for it. I admire the fact the reader never knows what to expect, it has a very good element of surprise."
4,"G.N. Thrilling,Incredible,Mind Puzzling mystery","G.N. If you want to read a good mystery, I recommend the Westing Game. It all starts when a rich man named Sam Westing dies and he invites his sixteen heirs. He wrote a will saying that he was murdered by one of them and he would not rest until the murderer was caught. All of the heirs had a partner and a set of clues to find out who the murderer was. The first team to find out would who the murderer was would inherit his estate and earn 2 million dollars. In the end, everyone is tricked with an ending that you would have never guessed happened."
4,"Great book,must read!!","This book starts when 16 heirs move into sunset toweres on September 1st. About two months later on haloween the heirs see smoke coming from the chimney of the westing manchine. A few days later the heirs are invited to the Westing manchine to hear the reading of Sam Westings will. It turns out the will is no normal will it is the directionas to a game that the heirs are playing. The object of the game is to find out who murdered Sam Westing. Tjhe winner of the game will recieve $200,000,000. They are told one of the heirs is Sam Westings murderer. At first they turn against eachother but in the end they work together to solve the puzzle."
4,Challenging.....,"I originally bought this book for my 10 year old daughter, but it turned out to be too much for her. She had a hard time keeping up with the 16 different main characters and the ""bouncing back and forth"" between all of these characters and their situations. After she gave up on it, I picked it up and read it. I thoroughly enjoyed it and this book managed to keep me interested until the very end. The plot is a bit of a puzzle...each character has a few pieces and the first to put them all together wins the $200 million. Some of the ideas these characters come up with are hilarious. The book is very well written and certainly deserving of attention, even though it didn't manage to hold the attention of my 10 year old. It was still a good purchase on my part."
2,A Confusing Mystery,"The Westing Game was an ok book. Most of the time it was so confusing with all the characters and scenes. I do not reccomend this book. It was just very weird how the story of Sam Westing is played out. There a few good parts.You can argue on my review but you have to read it to believe me.Tyler Clifton,NJ"
5,What a great book!,"This is truly a great book. When I started to read it, I expected a boring book,but when I got into it, I discovered how great it was. By putting in adventure, lots of suspense, mystery,and a huge puzzle, Ellen Raskin really showed me a great story that has got everything. You have to read this book. I also recommend ""The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon(I Mean Noel)"". Another great Raskin mystery puzzle book. You will really love this book."
4,Perfect for those who love mystery & comedy.,"This book will keep you guessing up till the very end. Just when ya think you know who done it - you'll be surprised again! Funny, Interesting, and cleverly written, you won't be able to put it down. It's great for kids and adults alike. A wonderful family book - read it with your kids."
5,The Westing Game,This is a great book... It defianately keeps you reading! I like how you know all the clues and can peice them together yourself. It has an awesome twist to the end!
1,The Westing Game,"(...) am in the 7th grade. I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin, and I thought it was the worst book ever. The setting of the book was at Sunset Towers. The most intresting charecter was Chris because he was a smart young man with disabilaties, and he was very good at chess. I felt The ending was sorta pointless because it dosen't matter when Westing dies. and it is very very very very very very confusing. I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not like mystery books."
3,Not The Best Book In The World,"If you like books that are boring in the begining good in the middel and really boring at the end? Then you should read the westing game. It starts out with a group of people moving to apertments then it jumps to a girl named turtle being dare to go into the westing E-state. Personaly I think this book is sort of confusing. It goes from one thing to another then to something else. I really could live without this book. I think if I have to read this book again I'll scream. So, like I said if you like books like the one I just described then go right ahead and read it."
2,A nonsensicle story that left me hanging at the end,"The story was interesting until the words started to run together. I had to do this book for a book report , and I read quite a bit , but I couldn't understand the message that was trying to get across to me - unless I read the part over five times in a row! I was 11 while reading it and I don't recommend it for other readers."
3,"The Westing Game, KCS","""Samuel W. Westing, the mysterious indrustialist who disappeared thirteen years ago, was found dead in his Westingtown mansion last night.""""I, Samuel Westing, hereby swear that I did not die of natural causes. My life was taken from me-by one of you! Who among you sixteen heris is worthy to be the Westing heir?"" - Samuel WestingThe sixteen heirs, Crow, Dr. Deere, Turtle, J.J. Ford, Shin Hoo, Douglas, Flora, Amber, Pulaski, Angela, Sandy, Jake, Grace, Madame Hoo, Chris, and Theo have been chosen by Samuel Westing to find the killer, but there was a twist, they each had to be in a pair(chosen by Samuel Westing), given one set of clues, and $10,000. The objective of the game is to win, the prize is $200 million, if you forfeit, your partner must forfeit and return the $10,000 and your clues will be held until the next session."
4,Do you like a good mystery game with clues?,"If you do, The Westing Game is the book for you. In this story a man was found dead, so all of his relatives are called and given clues and teams. They must solve the mystery. It is fun to read their strategies for solving the mystery, especially because the teams don't work together. But is the mystery really what it seems?I really like this book because the mystery is exciting and it is really fun to follow and try to solve. If you are a kid or a young adult and like a good mystery game, you should read this. -- Kristina"
4,The Westing Game,"I loved reading The Westing Game. I would recommend it to a lot of people. Even though I was the reader the answer to the game was hard to figure out. Also, I love all the unique chacters that Ellen Raskin has put together.The Westing game takes place in Michigan in a hotel like place called Sunset Towers. It is here where sixteen people are gathered to hear the reading of will of the very wealthy Samuel W. Westing. The will turns out to be some kind of insturctions for the heirs to play a game, and the winner iheirets Mr.Westing money.The sixteen heirs were put into pairs of twos, by the will, and given 10,000 dollers and two clues.The Westing Game is dangerous and very tricky but the heirs keep playing it through blizzards, burglaries, and bombings. Who will come out the victor? Who is cunning enough to figure out game of the twisted Samuel W. Westing?"
1,blond phone,"nokia 8801 is a very attractive phone, however not very functional. the keys are very small which make it very hard to type text messages. the battery life is a joke, it does not last half a day with normal usage.funtionality does not justify the price."
5,Cape May Calendar 2002,"The Cape May Calendar of 2002 is a visual feast of Victorian Cape May, New Jersey. Architecture only seen in Cape May, New Jersey make this calendar a collector's ""treasure"" of a by-gone era.The photographs are of the highest quailty and resolution. If you imagine the history of this Victorian resort town could ever be represented in print, then this calendar delivers! I could almost smell the sea breeze and hear the waves washing up on shore as I reviewed month after glorious month.Finally, a true depiction of Cape May, New Jersey is caught on a medium that can often disappoint a buyer of artistic calendars. I anxiously await the 2003 calendar and the beauty it depicts of our nation's first ""Resort."""
5,Super Fast SD memory,This is the fastest SD memory I tried.I already bought Sandisk Ultra II and Panasonic Super High Speed and are much slower than Transcend.I can use it with my Panasonic SVAV100 D-Snap MPEG4 Digital Video Recorder with excellent performance.Highly recommended !
5,Fantastic little thing,"It works like a charm. No problems whatsoever with it. I was so disappointed when my XBOX 360 Slim didnt come with a component cable, so i found this one for cheap and now everything is so pretty. I highly recommend it. I never buy any accessories from the big companies anymore, only third parties, like MadCatz or other similar firms. Official accessories are too darn expensive."
5,Works great!,Got a Pelican brand cable in the shipment. It works great. Just make sure you plug them into the right ports.
5,Beatiful book,Very well written and beatiful pictures. The child wasn't as impressed as me until she found the stickers and the star guide. :)
5,great,I purchased this for my son. I wanted him to learn what to look for when him and his dad got ready to pull out the microscope we bought him for Christmas. He loves this book.
4,pretty cute...,my son in 17 months and he loved this toy he dances around with it all the time!! the song it plays is really cute too! the only thing that bothered me was at first the pacifier was hard to put in but after a couple tries i guess it loosened up and no it goes in with no problem!!!
5,Another great Elmo product,"My 2 1/2 year old is recently facinated with Elmo. All the Elmo products are so expensive and have so many features that they are not hugable dolls anymore. This one is so cute. It's small enough for her to carry around and is still soft enough for her to sleep with. Elmo sings a song when the pacifier is out of his mouth. When you put the pacifier in his mouth, her can only hum the song. He makes a ""popping"" noise when you take the pacifier out.It is a little difficult for my 2 1/2 year old to get the pacifier in all the way sometimes, but she still manages without getting too frustrated. This is a great toy for the money and was about $[...] less expensive on Amazon."
5,Great reading,This was a very unique story line. You really get an observers' point of view of the Joker and why he's so terrifying.The ending joke was priceless. The artwork was spectacular. This was all about the Joker and as such was worth while reading.
5,batman at his best,"I bought this because it's a classic, I like the alternate story of the joker's origin. I like the fact that the joker and batman are shown as equal counterparts."
4,The genesis of the 'modern' interpretation of the Joker right here,"Over 20 years ago (1988) comic wunderkind scribe, Alan Moore teamed up with artist mastermind, Brian Bolland, to craft a 1-shot Batman book, ""The Killing Joke"" which would go on to serve as the blueprint for one of the most popular interpretations of the Joker ever (Heath Ledger in 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'). Although somewhat tame in today's era, at the time, 'The Killing Joke' stirred up a smidgen of controversy over the use of violence and depictions of The Joker's sadistic crimes. One thing that stands up to this date is the masterful character study of the Joker himself. The book flashes back to reveal the Joker's back story and provides a complete retelling of his origin to flesh out the reasoning on why the Joker became such a sadistic, cruel and brutal cold-blooded killer. While the narrative may feel somewhat skimpy this tale is truly all about the Joker (along with Bolland's detailed and sumptuous art)."
3,"Good, but not great",While the art is fantastic I was a little disappointed by the brevity and lack of depth in the story. It just seemed to be over too quick and left me wanting more.
3,Not the best joker....but,"This isn't bad i like the story, it's just missing something if you ask me I'm just not sure what it is. this joker to me was kinda a wuss totally awesome but he just seemed like he could have been so much better. the best part of the whole book was the end when he beat down batman that part was cool but the story up to it not so great"
5,Great Story,Very well written story that gives a little bit of a glimpse inside the mind of the Joker.
4,Batman: The Killing Joke,"For first timers: if you need to know how the Joker began, this sort of answered the questions for me when I obtained a copy of this book in 1988 when it was first released. (but in a modern replication of the original Joker's beginning as shown in classic Batman & Joker stories by Bob Kane and his writers/ artists.. )I still have it with me to this day among my collection. I think Brian Bollard's art is awesome, he also did a brilliant job on his front cover artworks of Wonder Woman comics in 1990s.This book has become a memorable read.. I still think of its story in my mind without reading it.. the artwork of the raining creating puddles is inspiring.I recommend it."
4,WOW!,"While short, this novel still had an great story to it and gives a little peek at the Joker's past life. A very good read with few flaws."
3,"Worth reading, but...","Batman: The Killing Joke was a good read, but it was not the ""amazing"" story I expected. With the statement by Tim Burton on the cover and the fact that it was written by Alan Moore (who they say in the afterword was really not that into it), I expected this graphic novel to be mind blowing. However, the book lacked a certain ""pop"" that is often found in Batman/Joker episodes. It was definately worth reading but borrow it from the library."
5,"One of the Best Batman Stories ever, but certainly for the mature reader","This is hands-down, one of the best Batman stories ever, however, it is intended for mature audiences, and with good reason. This is a no-holds-barred look into the madness of the Joker, why he became who he is, and his absolute disrespect for life. There are some scenes of partial nudity, a few instances of foul language, and the violence is graphically illustrated.Alan Moore is truly an outstanding comic book author, but his stories are meant for mature audiences, (see also V for Vendetta, The Watchmen, and Swamp Thing), but all are well worth reading.The story is entertaining, and provides a fascinating look at how Batman and the Joker are truly alike, different sides of the same coin, as it were, all due to one bad day."
3,nice design and good paper quality,"Nice design and good paper quality but I had not read a batman before, and this way of writing is too miserable for my appetite."
3,Was expecting more,"From reading the reviews, a lot of people love this read. I am not one of those people. This comic does have some dark twists but ultimately is just silly. Artwork is not as good as other batman comics as of late."
1,Do Not Buy Westinghouse LCD TV's,"My LTV-32W1 broke 1 month out of warranty. It turns out that Westinghouse does not have authorized service centers. Several TV repair shops wouldn't even look at it because they can't get parts. One shop finally took it but returned it after a month, unable to get parts. Westinghouse themselves don't even sell parts, check their webite."
1,Will never buy Westinghouse again!,"Had the TV no more than two years and the screen just started going blank. Like other reviewers, turning the TV off and then on again solved the problem in the beginning. Now when the screen goes blank, it has to be turned off for much longer periods of time before it works again. The price to fix the problem is more than the TV is worth. My brother owns a different model of Westinghouse and has had it for 6 months or so and the same thing is happening with his TV. Westinghouse it junk! Do not buy!"
2,out of paper,"This printer is SO frustrating. I've been fighting the error ""out of paper"" for several weeks. Office Depot told me i needed to clean the rollers. Seems to be a common problem. Don't buy this printer."
1,Stay away from 3310 and AIO printers,"I usually like HP products but not this one. I purchased the 3310 new, used it 6 months and it stopped scanning and copying. HP immediately replaced it which was not what I wanted. I preferred having mine fixed. Instead, they sent me a refurbished 3310. Soon afterwards, I had various problems with the refurbished replacement but it kept working for about 9 months. It now won't scan anything and to make multiple copies, I need to power down and power up the machine before making multiple copies. It won't print photos anymore. The only thing it does is print from my computer. I called HP service who told me I am out of warranty. Their answer was for me to trade this one in on the purchase of a refurbished, newer AIO model. No thanks. I will only purchase separate printing components from now on. No more AIO printers for me. Had to admit I was disappointed in HP's service for their AIO line. They are no longer the HP company I've purchased from for years."
1,stay away!,"I bought this machine to fax and scan only. I've had problems with scanning from the get-go. Sometimes it will scan, sometimes it will give me an error message, and I never know if I will be able to scan or not. I called tech support, they told me to bypass the 'scan' button on the machine and scan using the computer controls, well now that isn't working, some ADF paper message...there is no paper in my machine! $400.00 down the drain."
1,The most annoying printer I have ever owned,"Although the prospect of having the many features supplied by this printer was its selling point, it is by far the most annoying printer I have ever owned. This is due to the chronic problems with the printer not printing until you press a button acknowledging its warning that one of the many ink cartridges is getting low. Right now it will not print anything for me as one of the color print cartridges is empty, even though I only want to print in black and white. This is definitely not the printer for you if it is networked and you are not sitting right beside it to override the relentless print cartridge messages. I will never buy an HP printer again, as I waste too much time pushing buttons to get it to print, when it wants to tell me to buy more ink."
3,"Generally excellent, even for a Mac","After a year and half of experience with the 3310 running in a Macintosh environment, I am delighted with some of its features. Photo prints are magnificent. Document printing, scanning, copying, and faxing all work perfectly. Wireless communication is great. Although it took a year and a half for HP to correct software problems that made OCR and slide scanning features unavailable to Mac users, once the problems were fixed, the results were awesome."
1,Boring,Terrible game. What do you do when you cant find the item? And what a mess it makes....the kids didnt even care for it-it got only played once before it got shelved and never touched again.
2,Do you have a lot of (your own) kids?,"If you play this game at home with your own kids, some cousins, some neighborhood kids...your own kids will win big-time. Huge advantage.How will the other kids know where you keep stuff? Do you want these kids to destroy your house while they're at it? Best to purchase if you have at least 2 children (of your own!)over age 5."
3,Fun read,"This book isn't going to change your life, but it's a truly fun read. I really liked the Fleming scenes. He's portrayed pretty much like I always imagined him, and future Mayor Daley is an interesting addition. I do wish the Marx bros. had a bit more to do, but it was still a satisfying story, well told."
2,Tray Size Misrepresented!,"Right above here on this product page is stated:Corelle Melamine Tidbit Tray 06232, Heirloom BloomProduct Features:* Durable Melamine* 16"" x 12"" x 1""It is melamine all right, but it is NOT 16"" x 12"" x 1""!!!The measurements are stated right on the package: 15"" by 6-1/2""This is much smaller than Amazon states on the product page! Apparently no one read the measurements boldly printed on the front of the package and/or just made something up.If you are looking for a sizable tray, this is not it! It is long and narrow. It isn't even wide enough to hold a very small butter plate. I am very disappointed."
4,Baby Animals DVS,This is a great video to introduce children to the world of baby animals. My son loves it.
3,Betty in a 2-Way Sleepy Program,"There are 2 ensembles here: one set by Claus Ogerman but not with those famous forceful arrangements which have made his way as one of the great arrangers for singers. There is one Bossa Nova track ""One Note Samba"" which does not hip. The other set is arranged by Oliver Nelson but despite the all-star band it all resulted linearly sleepy. It all makes this a CD of a conventional vocalist while the best Betty is when she is unconventional."
5,"Great book, glad I bought it",Thank you for such great info. I just bought a new house and had granite counter tops installed(Blue Peral granite). I almost made a major mistake in not looking at the slab before my top was made. Mr. Hueston outlined some great tips and saved me a mojor headache. Thank you for providing such useful info. I would highly recommend thsi book to anyone even thinking about purchasing a stone or granite counter top.
2,Crown broke in two places,"My daughter needed a Statue of Liberty costume for a school project, so I bought this. The elastic strap on the crown broke on both sides in the 1 1/2 hours she wore it. The costume was cute, but not durable at all. Would not recommend it to anyone."
3,not quite there,"After groundbreaking albums, Shabooh Shoobah and The Swing, Listen Like Thieves seems to stagnate. To me this album does not leap forward like the previous ones and although it contains hits like What You Need, Listen Like Thieves and This Time it does not grab me and make me listen. Oddly the album does contain two outstanding tracks in Kiss The Dirt and Shine Like It Does which lift it above mediocre. One X One and Same Direction are among INXS' better rock songs. All up the band seems to have a pleasant snooze with this one between the fantastic ""The Swing"" and the record breaking ""Kick"" which is to appear two years later. A good steady album but a little below their best efforts."
4,LISTEN LIKE RETRO-THIEVES,"INXS's big, showy album from 1985, finds the late Michael Hutchence leading his band through agreeable, if a bit pat pop construction, which in retrospect, is a bit choppy and nerve ridden, like a constant hiccup, with belches of guitars cutting a sharp chord for hook's sake, bass vibrating like something funkadelic, and drums never veering from a rock beaten path. What was exciting in 1985 sounds routine today. ""This Time Will Be The Last Time"", still holds it's ground as snazzy pop harmonics, and ""Falling Down The Mountain"", is still an Aussieland-Appalachian misty folkish dream, but the rest of it, well, it's only rock 'n roll."
1,SHUT IT GEEK!!!,that geek who wrote the review about not being a geek isprobably the worst of geeks cuz you cant find real music so have to buy a soundtrack to a game in the real world you cant play if you dont want to be a geek dont buy this get 2pac greatest hits or Nas I am but stay away from this GEEZ
1,USB to Parallel IEEE 1284 Printer Adapter Cable PC,shipped form China? It is going to take how long??? Too long. Ordered Aug. 22 and I have to wait until Sept. - Oct.? Not good. They should have told me before I paid that there would be tentative dates up to months. Now I have to reorder. Gerrrrrr
2,Not as pictured,"The product does not match the item pictured, the driver does not cover anything beyond windows XP, and the driver is not in English."
5,Works perfectly,"It arrived, I plugged in my old HP Laserjet printer to my newer laptop and started printing. It's worked well for more than a year. A great purchase."
2,The H Man,"This cable does not solve the problem. I have tried everything that I could obtain from various reviews: new driver, various settings, etc. As far as I can tell - the cable does not work on my setup: HP LaserJet 4 Plus and Windows 7."
3,It lacks a real story.,"No doubt, Werner Herzog is an incredible director, Klaus Kinksi is a stunning actor, and this movie can put many American films to shame, but what is lacking in this epic is a real story. The story is at times very confusing, and I think the only reason the film was made was to haul the ship over the mountain. The viewer also gets to know nothing about the natives living in the jungle."
4,"A portrait of manic, unstoppable passion","Opera lover and mad dreamer Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) decides to moves a steamship overland from one river to another as part of a scheme to build an opera house in a remote part of the rain forest for Enrico Caruso to perform in. He is charismatic and enthusiastic in the beginning, passionately advocating his plans to various potential backers, all of whom turn him down. He is undeterred, as is director Werner Herzog, who matched his character's insane passion by actually transporting a steamship via block and tackle during the making of this film. The result is long and loosely structured but often hypnotic, another Herzog portrait of the frightening power of the human will to overcome all obstacles, even when its object is completely foolhardy. Nobody embodies that mania better than Kinski."
3,Entertaining but don't believe everything you read,"The book is entertaining and the choice of inventors and inventions is excellent but I found errors. For example, the bio for Linus Yale, Jr., who is credited with the invention of the pin tumbler lock, appears under a different lock patent that was filed years earlier by his father, Linus Yale, Sr."
3,Good British mysteries,"Peter wimsey is getting a bit dated since few really understand the period. Ian Carmichael is great as Wimsey, obviously some episodes will be better than others. I especially liked the harlequin costume episode. It stands out in my memory. A few episodes are predictable. But the series is really very good."
1,Not what I expected!,"I was looking for an explosive cinnamon mouthwash, but this was not it. It tastes like it is diluted with water. It actually left a poor taste in my mouth instead of giving me fresh breath. I feel bad throwing it away because it is such a large bottle, so it is sitting on a shelf. It may be OK for some who do not want a strong mouthwash, but it is not for me. Sorry Lavoris! By the way, I love ordering from Amazon and will continue. This was just not the product I was looking for."
1,The Bus Should Have Kept Going,"This is one of the least valuable books I've read in my life. My Book Club hated it. It was another non-story about a whiny, middle aged women who could not deal with the life she created and take responsibilty for fixing it.As you read the story, do not expect anything to happen ...nothing ever does. The story goes no where; the characters are minimally developed. Any deeper meaning was lost in the boring thoughts and feelings of lead character.At best, this is a poor attempt at imitating the style of ""The Metamorphosis"". If you like this type of challenge to your reality, read the real thing, Kafka.I'm sorry I wasted my money to prosper such a bad novelist. She must have paid the people who said good things about this book.If you must read this and I don't know why anyone would, borrow it from your local library."
2,Beware - premise more interesting than actual book!,"I didn't really care much for this book. The premise was more interesting - that of a woman who doesn't recognize her own son getting off the school bus - than it actually turned out to be. It was a very short novel - more of a novella than a novel, really. Ht narrator's flights of fancy became dull and rather cliche after the first fifty pages. The stylized writing was solid, but the lack of real characters and an actual moving plot detracted from its strength. The resolution was hardly satisfying - but really, the most frustrating thing was the lack of believable characters. There wasn't enough credibility created for some of the actions that took place. In the end, its only saving grace was that it was so short."
1,Weird and disappointing!,"I bought this book because the premise sounded fascinating. As I began to read, I found the style very difficult -- nothing seemed to flow. I kept reading, though, hoping that some really amazing ending would justify my time. Boy, was I wrong! Maybe I'm shallow and not bright enough to understand, but I never could figure out whether it was supposed to be about a sick child, an evil child, or a just-plain-nuts mother. This is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. A complete waste of time."
3,"Unusually Creative, also Tedious","This story has an intriguing premise and makes several layers of reading possible, literal and metaphorical. Looking at the other reader reviews, I am amazed by the fact that nobody else understood that there IS in fact a clear ending to the story. Just re-read all the passages in the book pertaining to the bus driver, Sandy, with very special attention to detail. It's all quite obvious.Unfortunately, I found this story's third person narrative, however unusual, to be repetitive and there seems to be little new said between pages 100 and 180. This is unfortunate, since several of the characterizations and descriptions are crisp and unforgettable. Read this book only if you are a very fast reader."
1,never even got to use it!,"i received this dehydrator for christmas and was very excited to open it up and use it.bought everything i needed to make beef jerky and was ready to begin when to my dismay, i saw the bottom tray that rotates broken.i contacted amazon and went through a smooth exchange process.2 days later i have my other dehydrator. WOW Amazon!i open my box fired up to make my beef jerky when low and beholdthe bottom tray is again broken!amazon says they cant exchange it again, but i guess thats for the better.as they say, you get what you pay for!guess i'll have to keep buying my jerky. :-("
1,awful piece of junk!,"The bottom tray (that fits on the spindle that turns everything) broke the second time I used this piece of junk. It broke in several places. Apparently the heat is too hot at the bottom of the unit and breaks the plastic. Also, the foods on the bottom tray burned while the foods on the top tray had not finished dehydrating. I live out of the country and it costs me dearly to ship something to me plus pay customs on it. I sure wasted my money on this piece of junk!"
2,Annoying,"Avoid the rotating version. The rotating carriage sometimes gets stuck and then it no longer rotates, leaving one small section to become overly dry and the rest undried. The rotating carriage squeaks as it turns. The bottom tray has a different design than the other trays because it interfaces with the motor axle to turn the whole stack of trays. This means the bottom tray cannot be switched with any of the other trays and thus you will not be able to shuffle it with the other trays to get even drying among the trays. I also own 'The Food Dehydrator' by Mr. Coffee (~$40) that does not rotate and it works better. The Aroma consumes 165 Watts and the Mr. Coffee 275 Watts so the Aroma comes up short on drying power. Perhaps the rotation system was implemented to reduce the amount of power needed to dry, but it may have also been implemented to be annoying. It does not dry very well but it is pretty good at being annoying. I sold this unit on Craigslist and kept the Mr. Coffee."
2,Smallest Show on Earch well titled,"Marginally affecting in a gentle 50's way, but ultimately can't overcome the torpid pacing. A bit too gentle for my tastes. Virginia McKenna is, as always, worth the watching"
4,Larry King on Heart Disease,"I am sure your must have heard about this author. Yes, he is THE Larry King of Larry King Live on CNN. In this book the author tells us how a couple of famous people who were suffering from heart diseases were able to conquer their conditions. It is reviewed by one of the doctors who operated Mr King. This book is just like his show and has a lot of inspirational stories.Overall, it's a great feel-good type of book. Just like my new beverage of choice called s o y f e e. It's made from soybeans that you brew just like coffee. Caffeine-free, you'll find it at www. S oycoffe e.com."
4,R&B review,music selections were greatQuality of 3 disks were poor. Last two or three songs skipped or stoped without completion of songs.
2,more artists,"ps. just like to include more great r n b artists that should be on this great box set from atlantic records like levert & the system. put other divine hits out so more people are aware of other great talent,just plain wholesome good music.do you like good music,that sweet soul music!give us more hits by roberta flack, wilson pickett,ben e. king, arthur conley, otis redding, sam&dave aretha,rb greaves,drifters,spinners,esther phillips,les mccan,eddie harris, herbie mann, yusef lateef, the kingpins, percy sledge,major harris,chuck willis, clyde mcphatter,coasters,jimmy castor,ace spectrum,peggy scott&jojo benson,shirley scott,clifford brown,billy cobham,cornell dupree,blue eyed soul from lulu,delaney&bonnie&friends,awb,bette midler,the manhattan transfer,billy vera,the late,great ms.dusty spingfield,buffalo springfield,derek&the dominos,plus many more!keep up the great work!keep on soulin'on!thank you!jhh52757!"
1,Prints fast... until the paper feeder quits working,"This printer worked great for the first hundred pages and the photo pictures look great. Unfortunately, as others have stated, the paper feed mechanism has quit working. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,breaks down constantly,"I've owned this machine for about 4 months and it has failed to perform frequently. I've spent hours on line and on the telephone with HP technicians who reassure me that they understand and that the problems will get fixed. We do manage to patch it up, until the next problem.Now the paper will not feed paper at all. The web site acknowledges that my machine is defective and needs a special kit for fixing it.I called for the fix and it took almost a half hour for them to jump me through their hoops until they acknowledged that I should get their kit, ""at no charge"" as of they were doing me a favor! In the meantime, I can't get my work done, and I'm losing money. HP is ready with their nice words, but words are cheap, and this machine has sucked out both my time and my money."
1,"Got the printer but no manual, no installation CD and no USB cable","I believe the HP-PhotoSmart-3210 All-in-one is great as a home printer, but I have not received the manual, installation CD and USB cable from Amazon / Tech for Less. After complaining they send me a copy of the manual. I bought myself the USB cable ($28) but the printer can't be installed without the CD. When you buy a printer you expect to be able to install it after opening the package, isn't that right?"
4,back up printer,I have a hp 3210 all in one printer....that I have had for about 5 yrs....and use for all my printing needs ...much in photo printing...this 6 ink printer has always done great on photo work...this reworked 3210 hp that I bought about 2 months ago..I made it my main printer and the not refurbished old printer.. is my back up....this latest bought printer is quieter than the older one...I have two other printers that I do not use much ..the are good but not but 3 inks and the photo work is not nearly as good...the reason for 4 stars .. not 5 stars is the glass was dusty inside and the outside shows hard use in the past...remember this one is refurbished.
5,This has to be the best printer made,"I don't know about these people wirting bad reviews but I take a lot of pictures because photography is a hobby of mine and this is the easiest printer for photography. It does film or digital, it's so easy, just put in the film or card and print, you don't even need your computer!"
1,WILL NOT PRINT FOOTERS!,"This printer is good looking, may print fine photos or whatever and my only original complaint was the little paper tray that catches the printed sheet is always loose or falling off. That was my only little complaint before the nightmare began.ONCE I TRIED TO PRINT A DOCUMENT WITH A FOOTER, I NEARLY LOST MY MIND!!!I spent hours on the telephone with Hewlett Packard, then the Mac people and then Microsoft, then back to Hewlett Packard again. I logged around eight telephone hours trying to get this thing to work. It will not and no one can fix it. It turns out that this is a known problem. So only buy this printer if you never intend to print a header or a footer. I am exchanging it tomorrow, but the store where I purchased it is taking it back, not HP.This is my second HP printer with user problems. I give up."
1,doesn't last,Bought the 3210 Xi and used it lightly but the printhead broke and its past warantee. I called hp to find where to have it repaired or get replacement parts and they said its not worth having it repaired and I was just upsold instead by someone with a thick accent and poor call quality... hmmm.... anyway we thought we were purchasing the best but I am SO tired of buying new things every time something g breaks. Where is quality and pride these days?
5,A Blender that really blends!,"I found this blender listed in Good Housekeeper's archive for the best blenders. I have to say I completely agree with the rave. It does an awesome job with blending everything together without chunks. Also, the presentation of the blender is very classy as well!"
5,Exodus Received,"Langston's commentary on Exodus grants biblical scholarship new and welcomed insights into the ""reception"" of the biblical text across the centuries. Building on the conceptualization of Reception History in literary analysis, this early volume in the Blackwell series provides a ""first glimpse"" for many into considerations that a text ""exists"" only as it is heard by the reader.While biblicists may shout ""heresy"" and call for Langston's death at the stake, the author draws on examples from both sacred and secular literature, the plastic arts, even American political rhetoric to demonstrate that, so very often, a biblical text ""means"" what a particular community says it means.A highly recommended read for those seeking to draw new wine from ancient skins."
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" FOR A COLLECTOR OF MECHANICAL MUSIC","I Highly recommend Encyclopedia of Automatic Muscial Instruments for collectors, restorers or anyone interested in these wonderful musical instruments. Excellent in-depth content with many many photo illustrations. One of the great works from Vestal Press, a publisher that had published many terrific works about mechanical music instruments. The Bowers Encyclopedia is one of their best."
1,"Bad acting, poor plotting = BAD movie","Bad acting, especially the actress. The plotting is poor and boring. Korean has made some decent movies but definitely not this poor low budget movie. Don't waste your time and money on this movie."
5,Great product,"This is a wonderful alternative to traditional thimbles as you can place it on the side of your finger, my grandmother has arthritis and this is easier for her to use."
3,Bio med book,Required for class. Had to get it. As good a college book as any. Great price though will probably sell it for a profit.
4,Good fun,"Almost every page has drawings, and the story flow is pretty simple to follow, with engaging characters. It's the same plot as many other fantasy adventures, and nicely done within that typical plot line."
4,An Unknown Peter Sellers Gem,"This has to rank as one of Peter Sellers' greatest performances, albeit in a dramatic vehicle. When the film begins Sellers appears to be a repugnant character and Sinead Cusack appears to be his helpless victim. However, as the story unfolds, these assumptions are turned upside their head in credible fashion. Anybody willing to take a chance on a unique and ultimately charming love story should see this one."
3,"Funny, but insult to REAL boot camp...","Ok, Ok, This is a great movie because Murray and Ramis make a great team, with either Ramis in front or behind the camera (i.e. Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day}. This film would have received 4 stars except for the lame boot camp scenes. Having been in boot camp myself, this is just plain nonsense. Yes, its funny, but so unbelievable. Boot camp does not consist of the drill instructor(D.I.) sitting around with recruits ""getting to know them"", EVERYONE has their head shaved, and recruits don't joke around if their D.I. is even within earshot. I know its a comedy, but some things are hard to laugh at. Boot camp is DEFINATELY near the top of the list."
2,I thought this movie would be excellent,"I bought ""Stripes"" on the account that one of my favorite actors, bill murray, was in the movie- without ever seeing it prior. I don't think i will ever blindly buy a movie again because of this purchase. This movie wasn't any good. It wasn't very funny, and DEFINITELY is not Murray's best movie. In fact, it is probably the worst murray movie i've ever seen. Granted, it does have occasional funny parts, but overall i give it two stars. i think that is pretty generous."
3,You'd Expect More With Such a Talented Cast,"I've always been somewhat perplexed by the ""hilarious"" reputation this 1981 hit has garnered. ""Stripes"" follows Bill Murray and Harold Ramis playing two friends dissatisfied with their lives, so they join the Army. And of course, hilarity ensues - or attempts to ensue, but most of the time the comedy seems rather forced. The best thing about ""Stripes"" however is unquestionably the chemistry in the tension between Murray's slovenly, irreverent John Winger and Warren Oates' realistic drill instructor Sgt. Hulka. John Larroquette is of course brilliantly funny in his sniveling role, with occasional bright moments from John Candy as Ox and Conrad Dunn as Psycho (but don't call him Francis or he'll kill you). Otherwise, ""Stripes"" is a bit generic, a letdown made all the more disappointing considering the slew of talented players on board."
5,A very funny bill murray vehicle .Bill is a real take charge guy ?!?,"I found the movie to be very funny...Imagine a loser bill murray,finding himself in the military!!!as a take charge kind of guy...He commands some real odd balls ,on a mission too funny to explain...I got a real kick out of the movie...and i highly recommend it...This movie makes an excellent holiday gift..."
2,No way to turn off the annoying BEEPing,"Wonderful toaster oven! Works like a charm! Lots of room and excellent quality cooking.Unfortunately, the beeping sound is so loud that we had to return it:( Hopefully Oster will make another one soon that at least gives one the option of having the annoying very loud beep or NOT!"
5,LENGEND.....wait for it...... ARY,SOOOOOOO GOOOOD I love this product because they work till when you first use it to the very last drop of ink
5,A great movie,"Everything in this movie is splendid : photography, acting, direction. It is a story with a powerful human content and love expressed in the most subtle terms. Action-wise, it is fantastic.The music is magnificent too and very original. This movie made me think of Ran by Kurosawa, although Kurosawa is more refined. Not to be missed."
1,Eh,"Great cinematography sometimes, but the movie doesn't make sense. The action is not well filmed and there's not much in the way of choreography. The plot is so-so. Not explained how a slave can be such a fantastic warrior. Who, by the way, behaves dishonorably to a couple of messengers under the flag of truce. Also unbelievable (since we don't see great fight choreography) is how they stand against superior numbers; how a Mongol cavalryman can be bested by a civilian who picks up a spear for the first time; how the Mongols break off their attack to honor the death of one of their VIPs. Finally just glad it was over."
3,no Croughing Tiger here,"Movie was Ok, all action scenes with Musa are bangin, the rest of the movie is slow. Production is great but do you really need great production in the desert?Rent-YesBuy-Maybe/No"
5,GREAT MOVIE,This is a great movie with lots of twists and turns. A great cast and very well written. The type of film you can watch over and over and still find things you missed the time before. I highly recommend it!
3,Great pictures but they ruined it!,The original edition of this book was better! It was made to be read with the children sitting in front of you. The text (which is great) was on the back & the pictures were 2 full pages in front for the kids to study while you read. This one has the pictures shrunk so small you can't even start to appreciate the detail & great work & the text often takes up more space than the pictures. It's still worth having if you don't have an earlier edition because these are the best paintings of santa ever. Whoever did this though should be ashamed & republish the original which is the greatest book on santa ever written.
5,Required Reading for MFC Developer,"Over the years this has proven to be my ""go to"" book. The only book that really explains what's going on under the covers. When something breaks, and it will, you need the kind of in-depth understanding this book provides. There's no short cut, pay the price in money and time and it'll make your MFC programming life worth living."
4,God by machine,"Except for the late lack of coherent time linethe series is well written and well acted.The alien space craft the rescues them whenthey run out of CO2 scrubbed air,makes the series possible. Time travel has been argued as impossible,but that is four dimensional physics which is entirely outmoded.The idea of super-beings inhabiting the Internetand making androids is one of the major featuresof this movie. That NASA has become a government agencythat even vets of it don't really trust becomes obviousvery soon.I loved this series and wish I had seen it.Not a Star Trek, but sci fi TV is now rareand seems to not survive long?"
2,Odyssey 5,"Sorry, bad words ruin any movie. I did not know they were in this series. I do not want to endure the bad words for the content's sake so I will not watch it."
1,Sony should be sued for selling this product.,"LIke others who have reviewed the ""complete series"" I am extremely angry that Sony did not warn potential buyers that the series ended prematurely with no conclusion. I did not see the original, so had no idea. This is marketing at its absolute worst."
1,Odyssey 5,If you don't like swearing and cursing God don't buy this unfinished series. I see why I don't see it as reruns. Wouldn't want my children to watch.
3,"If you take out swearing, it'd be a silient movie",Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
5,Amazing and helpful book,"What a wonderful way to share the gospel with your children, grandchildren, or even the child within you. You won't be dissapointed with this wonderfully illustrated devotional."
1,Awful,"First of all, where is the hip-hop? The music used in this video is definitely new agey and not hip-hop at all! I also disliked the voice over during the workout and much prefer when the instructor is actually talking to me rather than staring at me with a strange smile. The moves are not explained well and even though she's a great belly dancer herself, teaching doesn't seem to be her forte in this video. Waste of money."
4,Exotic fun..!!,"The title says: BELLYDANCE Fitness for Weight Loss; which was exactly what it delivered. I don't understand how people can rate this as a dance video and expect some super-crafty moves from it. This is a dance workout. A DANCE WORKOUT. Not a dance recital, not a performance for other dancers, not a guide on how to master bellydancing..! W-O-R-K-O-U-T.Okay, that being said, as a WORKOUT video, I find it awesome and great fun. Rania's gorgeous and her smiling face kept me perked up from the beginning and the choice of dancers in a variety of sizes should be applauded. There's a slim one, a curvy one, a little plump one and even a super pale one who looked like she could use a tan badly. Not that it matters of course as this is a bellydance video and not some kinda beauty pageant :DIn short, great video; the routines are simple to follow and are sexy enough to make you an exotic goddess for your boyfriend :DEnjoy!"
2,"Looks great, low quality.","It's funny, but the last time I bought a toaster from a brand I normally think of as quality, it stunk too. That was a Krups ToastSupreme Compact.To look at the other reviews, I'd guess that Oster is having significant quality control problems here. My toaster has a darkness knob that doesn't appear to do anything, and toasts so light at the highest setting that I have to toast everything but Pop Tarts twice. The lifter needs too much force for the weight of the toaster -- you'll lift the toaster itself instead. A good portion of the time the element doesn't turn on when I push the lever down; it requires a good sharp motion to work. And once, when I accidentally pushed down too hard on the toast trying to flip it out -- the slots are a little too deep for my favorite bread -- one of the things the bread rests on got knocked out of its track. It was easily fixable, but it shouldn't have happened."
3,Its ok - wouldn't buy it again,"I think the toaster is really nice looking and it toasts bread well.My complaints are two - 1) the toasts does not pop up high enough to easily pick it out. if you have toaster tongs, should be no problem. but, it is kinda of annoying when you are in a hurry. 2) the sides get so crazy hot after it has been used. We do not keep ours on the counter since we don't have a lot of counter space. But because it gets so hot, we have to let the sides cool for an hour or two before we put it back in the cabinet.Neither of these may be a problem for most people, but they make me wish we didn't buy this toaster."
3,Replacement toaster works when you know how to use it,"This is a replacement for the same model toaster that was broken by a friend who did not know how to work it. I got it because I am used to its predecessor and the price was right. I like the selection button for frozen items. The toast cycle can be cancelled by pushing the cancel button. The toaster makes good consistently brown toast. I did not give this toaster 5 stars because it is difficult to clean. Yes there is a removable crumb tray, but a lot of crumbs get caught inside and never make to the crumb tray. The only way to clean out those crumbs is to blow it out with compressed air, which we have. The other thing that bothers me is that I have to lift the toast out of the toaster by moving the push handle up all the way. If the item is small I have to go get a fork. The picture of the items in this toaster is misleading. Most items just peek above the top and that is only if you push the handle up."
2,Only kept this one for two months,Cheap toaster with cheap results. You will burn your hand on this one and settings were never accurate. Toast only partially pops up and you need a utensil to get it out. Replaced it with a Calaphon and could not be happier with it. You have been advised................
2,Again - Toasts One Side!,"What is wrong with the toasters they're manufacturing today? This was the second brand of toaster I had to return - also returned a Black & Decker - both would only toast one side! Seems like they'd have it right by now. I finally bought one of the refurbished Cuisinarts (an $80 toaster for $30), thinking I could put a spotlight on it and use it as a display piece if it didn't work, but the Cuisinart is a great toaster! I guess you get what you pay for (unless you buy refurb ;)"
3,Poldark Series 2,"We loved watching the first Poldark package in Series 1. We watched the series on PBS many years ago and were happy to purchase it on DVD. However, when we started playing Disc 1 on Series 2, the picture broke up so badly. We could not enjoy that disc so went to the next disc and all others played fine!! Other than the one bad disc, we love this PBS series and will be watching it over and over again."
3,"Doesn't size ""true""","Although the shoes were every bit as attractive once I received them as they were on the screen, I couldn't even fit my foot into them. I am usually an across-the-board 9 1/2, but these fit more like an 8 1/2. I had my sister in law try them on (she wears a 9), but they didn't fit her either, and so I ended up giving them to my niece, who wears an 8 1/2. I would encourage anyone who wants to order these shoes to try on this brand in a bricks-and-mortar before making a purchase. They simply do not size in a standard manner."
1,Pointless,"I have no problems with the belief in reincarnation (I rather like the idea), but this mess of a book is simply silly. I'm not even sure why I disliked it so much. Maybe I was Mordred in a previous life!"
1,One of the funniest books ever...,I almost peed my pants laughing at the stupidity of this book. Don't buy it.
3,"""Zoo"" is great; ""Round and Round"" has a scary man in it!","I'd give ""Let's Go to the Zoo"" 5 stars. My 20 month old LOVES it!! It's really a great video (and he normally doesn't like TV at all -- and I personally don't normally like Barney).However, the other video, ""Round and Round We Go,"" has an older man in it that scares my son to death. He can't get past the intro, for fear that the man will come onto the screen soon. Maybe he'll grow out of it, but he may grow out of Barney by then, too...I should have just bought the zoo video instead of the bargain 2-pack that included the video with the weird-looking man."
3,"Good, but borrows a little too much from HP manuals","My boss told me I had tolearn Logical Volume Management, so I bought this book [through amazon.com] last year.The book does a very good job at the basics: concepts, commands, and even syntax.It does not do as well in advanced topics, such as trouble-shooting, and the examples provided are too simple. For example, when I encountered some advanced problems, I found that this book either glossed over the issue or did not cover it at all. Furthermore, when I checked the HP Sys Admin manual, I found the exact same examples in that manual.In short, a good book, but it could have been a lot better with a little more effort by the author."
1,"It Effected Me, But Not In A Good Way","The stupid album title is an indicator of greater lameness to come. This album made me want to vomit. Actually, I'm ashamed to admit I ever owned it, even if only on vinyl."
5,One of the best record ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the tird studio album of one of the gratest punk/Oi bands ever.The Upstarts were, as anyone reading this should know, one of the founding bands of the entire Oi movement.The ""2000000 Voices"" lps is among the finest examples of what was so inspiring about the original Oi scene, and should be obtained at all costs."
3,Not great but it works,Got this for school. It was pretty good at explaining the process of Object-oriented programming but the language it used wasn't very clear. The exercises it has throughout are helpful at giving you programming practice but it doesn't really jump into it till about half way through the book.
3,Goes On and On and On,"I was disappointed in this early reader, which is set in large type with lots of white space between the lines, stretched out to about 70 pages. It could have easily been a 36- or 48-page story and moved more quickly. I guess that each of us likes a particular type of humor, and this is just not my type. It's hard to relate to the Watsons, who seem dense. It's hard to relate to Mercy, who seems one-dimensional. I even find it hard to relate to the caricature-type art. Guess I'll go have some buttered toast and tea."
3,This CD is not from Chazz of Epicenter Music,"This CD is not from ""real"" Chazz that brought you ""A Mover La Colita"" and the new hot album ""Livin It Up"""
5,"Sinister, sensual and spectacular","This double delight from Layton is stunning in its complexity as three rogues--the genuine article--set out to capture the affections of a lady but for wholly immoral purposes. Echos of Richardson's ""Clarissa"" and ""Pamela"" ring throughout ""The Duke's Wager"". A dark stalking piece, frightening at times with its sinister elements, ""The Duke's Wager"" captures a theme of desire and redemption with exceptional style""Lord of Dishonor"" breathes life into a few tired cliches and makes them nubile and entertaining as the latest and most scandalous on dit. The characters were all well drawn and incited fear, loathing, pitty, even contempt at times, yet their depth of character always forces the reader to return to sympathies he or she might rather not have. STrongly recommend this read!"
1,How depressing,"This has to be the most depressing Christmas Album I've ever heard. I love Michael Ball's voice, but there was not one upbeat song on the album. This one is either going to get donated to the library (others may appreciate it more than I) or collect dust at my house."
5,Wonderful Christmas Music,"I bought this cd some months ago in preperation for the Christmas Season, and I'm glad I did. It has instantly become one of my favorite Christmas albums. ( And notice I didn't say the word ""holiday."" How I've grown to hate that word!) Michael Ball's beautiful voice and the excellent arrangements make each song a joy to listen to. Along with a few beautiful more traditional Christmas carols, there are some more modern selections. I particularly liked ""Driving Home for Christmas "" and ""Happy New Year"" (the Abba song). Really nice. All in all most highly recommended. A Very Merry Christmas to all!"
4,A Reveiw of a special album,From the moment you peel the cellophane off the shiney fresh compact disc creation its as if it barges into your life and takes over. Once you press that play button theres no going back.its as if it takes your dull 9 to 5 life style & throws it into a christmas frenzy . This album is fresh funky and my bottom hurts.
5,Wow ..what a glitter,"Well I bought this ring and I got to say I love it .I think this ring shines more than my real white gold and diamond well and also very fast service in four days.I will buy another design soon ,Thank you, GEM AVENUEFrom Alex"
1,CAUTION NOT GLUTEN FREE,Check the ingredient list--it contains WHEAT GLUTEN--VERY DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE WITH A GLUTEN ALLERGY OR CELIAC DISEASE.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I ordered these and when I got them, 18 of the 50 cases were broken. Very fragile, made of cheap plastic. The packaging is pretty worthless as well, so if during shipping they get bumped around at all, some are gonna be broken. There are quality slim cases available, but not these."
2,Loud messy and cheap,Guess the old saying you get what you pay for applies here. I purchased this for under 15.00- The hand unit worked well with smoothies though the liquid always SPLASHED up and out of the beaker making a mess. After the first week the blender began to shake and make such loud noises that it cracked the plastic beaker! Now it sounds like it is grinding bolts. Will not purchase this brand again.
1,Do not waste your $$!,I've been using hand blenders for years now (I make a lot of protein shakes) and this is the WORST one I've ever used. I'm returning it. The liquid flies out through the holes in the blender and all over you and the counter! Don't waste your money.
1,Wish I had read these reviews first...,"I'm usually pretty good about researching first but I was already at Target, I needed a blender and there was this for $20 and the KitchenAid for $50. Being Mr. Cheap, I of course bought this one and...well, it lasted 2 weeks before the plastic housing broke and it won't hold the blade any more. Of course I pitched the box and receipt so I'm out $20...but smarter!"
3,RGCvik,Had this for a couple years and continue to use it almost daily. I only use it to make protein shakes with milk and power mix. It seems to work well for that. One does have to be careful not to pull the unit out of the cup to much or it will splatter all over the place; I don't falt the unit only the user...after all it is a blender..... It is a little noisy and can vibrate the counter a little if you place the head all the way to the bottom of the cup. It is simple to use (two buttons) and very easy to clean.
1,"Irritating to use, broke after two uses","I received this for a gift last Christmas and just used it for the second time ever. I was trying to make a milkshake using liquid and formed (but not solid) ice cream, and the blades came off the shaft. I tried to screw it back on as I could see that there were threads, but it would just fall off again. Two uses and it's done, not worth buying.Aside from the fact that it broke, I do not like the power buttons. You have to press them down so far past the plastic housing, that it was uncomfortable and difficult to press. I could only hold it down a couple of seconds at a time before it would stop. I think my finger would rise up very slightly, just enough to shut it off."
1,Broke during second use,This product is not worth a dime. It makes a lot of noise and cannot handle any serious blending. The second time I used it I was trying to make a smoothie in the cup provided with the blender. Both blades bent backward when they came in contact with the ice and the cup cracked. I returned it (luckily) for a full refund.
3,The stated info differs from the CD info,The information on the CD jacket differs from the information in the Amazon description. The Amazon description states that this product can be used by Macintosh computers and it can not. The cover does not state that this is availabe for any Macintosh platforms only a Windows platform. This causes confusion for Macintosh users.
3,Good description of elementary Ballroom steps.,"Although the descriptions are quite good, the pictures and illustrations are confusing and not very useful. The book is quite complete, and although not great, is the best available."
5,Super camera for this price,"I bought this camera 9 months ago and I've been very happy with it. Picture quality is superb. Never showed blurry pictures unless ""shooting without flash in darker places"". If you shoot without flash in dark places pictures will be blurry. It is not a flaw. This problem is related to ""night shot"" ability. You may choose others for more money. Movie quality is medium. Overall this is a perfect choice for leisure purposes."
2,So So,"The door for the battery is broke so it won't stay closed unless you tape it. Seller had to have know because there was sticky residue left around that area, letting me know it was previously taped. I bought this product for a pre-teen. That specific info would have been nice to know in the item description prior to purchase. It also needed to be cleaned. Other than that it's fine. No manufacturing default yet."
3,Good but too much,This DVD is just alittle too much of a good thing. Great as backround playing at a party on in the surf shop. But 2 plus hrs of the same wave at Malibus and every one doing the same stuff is flat out overkill. buy it if you can get it cheep its o.k. to view for 30 min. then come back later and flick it back on. A must have surf flick I don't think so.
5,"Yes, Yes, Yes",Not sure how this could ever get a 1 star? But anyhow - if you like music and especially if you are musically inclined this is a 4-5 for sure.Just tune in to owner of a lonely heart for a second - but have a good sound system. It is such quality music you want to hear it correclty:)
3,Just one song!,"I honestly purchased the record for just one song, make a guess butI found a couple of other songs that I liked."
3,Good but Overrated,"Both 90125 and the follow-up, Big Generator, are something of aberrations for Yes. The songs have little of what made Yes popular in the 1970s. Instead, the Trevor Rabin-era Yes is a pop/rock band that incorporated some of the elements of its progressive past.Given Yes's diverse influences, this is hardly surprising - especially since this version of the band lacked its two primary progressivists, Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman. ""Changes"" is a great song, and ""Hearts"" is probably the most ""old Yes"" song. The rest of the songs are good, tight rock songs. If you know Yes, then you know what the band is about. If you don't know Yes, give some of their early albums (particularly Close to the Edge) or one of the Keys to Ascension albums a listen first or in addition to the 80s discs."
3,Trevor Rabin did his best...,"... to turn these fast-aging prog rock stars into solid musicians, devoid of the empty grandeur dreams which floods their late 70s efforts.90125 is a decent album. Yes, it had a catchy disco-hit -so what? If you prefer 40 minutes of uncoordinated musical rambling (I mean you, Tales from Topographic Oceans) I bet you hated 90125. Too bad. I'd rather dance to a good solid song like Owner of a Broken Heart."
5,"Perfect album, great for introduction to new YES listeners...","If I had to pick a single starter album to introduce YES to my teenagers, I think I would choose this one. Great album all the way thru! It has tremendous YES qualities and stands its ground..."
5,Great Power Pop - Leave It,"THe song is Leave It off of this album. For a lot of the lightweight pop that was created around this time, this album has a lot to offer. Great musicianship with pop sensibility."
5,This album blows away the original CD,"Now this is a CD you will definitely want to grab up while they last.The bonus tracks should have been included the first go round...but, oh well.The sound is much stronger and louder than the original CD....it matches the other masters well.WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE THE ""BIG GENERATOR"" ALBUM IN THIS FORMAT???????"
3,"Catchy tunes, but not YES","There are some songs on here that are catchy. Foot tapping songs. Very interesting. But, that is not what YES music was, or is about. (Check out THE LADDER or MAGNIFICATION, the latest two YES cd's for a return to Close to the Edge style). But, if this CD is good for anything, it was the HOLDING together of YES for another chance at keeping the flame lit, which it did get relit ...."
5,I love everything by this author,Really. The book is just satisfying. I like the main characters and Roe is a complex woman well worth reading about.
2,Disappointed,"I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and loved them. Next, I bought all the Aurora Teagarden mysteries, expecting the same level of wit, charm and fun. The first several Teagardens were frothy ""Nancy Drew"" type mysteries but this last one seemed as if it was either written in a rush or never edited. The so-called mystery is totally unbelievable and completely ridiculous. I read the final pages twice to make sure I wasn't missing something vital. The best advice I can give to readers is to skip this volume and hope the next book in the series is better!"
3,A decent light read,"I recently read Dead Until Dark and loved it, so I had high hopes for this book by the same author. Ultimately, it was rather disappointing - it was a decent light read, but nowhere near as enjoyable as Ms. Harris' more well-known series.I might have liked it better if I hadn't read the wonderfully quirky Dead Until Dark first."
4,Short bio,"It's short (54 pages), but that's alright since there's only second-hand accounts of Socrates anyway. Anthony Gottlieb makes the most of this space and you end up with a pretty good idea of how Socrates viewed life and intellectual inquiry, as well as the distinctions between his philosophy and that of Plato and other followers and critics. Since he is the first significant philosopher, he's worth understanding, and this book will not consume much of your time."
1,sticky mess,"There's a slimy mess that comes out of the bottle that only washes off after a great deal of water and rubbing, and it is next to impossible to keep the slime from hanging in a thin line between the nozzle it comes out of and whatever you are applying it to. You'll be in the shower for 10 minutes afterwards and then who knows what else it's gotten all over in between. It's so frustrating that it kills any mood, in fact it sours it greatly. I threw it away after a few attempts."
3,fun to do with my Mom,this workout is also fun to laugh at. The main teacher is so stiff and her fake smile is annoying. She sometimes says the wrong things at the wrong times. I watch her backup dancers more because they're better dancers.It's fun though because I like learning to move my body in that way and it's nice together time with my mom.
4,Hip Hop Hip Drop,"I originally purchased this set since I was getting bored of regular cardio workouts. Overall, I enjoy doing the workouts. The first time I couldn't quite get all of the steps, but after the second time it's easy to catch on. It is definitely not as strenous as say tae bo, but it's fun so I am more motivated to do it. Plus I feel like I am standing up straighter since I'm working my back and abs more. I absolutely love the bonus workouts on each DVD, they definitely made me sore the next day--I love that feeling!"
5,Swee smell of success,The perfume I ordered (Vera Wang Princess) arrived in the time indicated and in the condition represented. I am more than happy with this purchase and the way it was handled.
2,I was disappointed,"When I saw the review that said this perfume is better than Thierry Mugler's Angel, I was so excited because it's my favorite scent. I thought I would LOVE Vera Wang's Princess. Well, I spray it on and for 2 seconds I smell a baby powder type scent and then, absolutely nothing. Uuggh!! I was thankful that I only paid $28.00 including shipping for an unopened box from Ebay.Update: The key to hating this fragrance was the fact that I got a fake on ebay. I purchased the rollerball of Vera Wang Princess and it smells great!"
4,"This perfume is so nice! Not overwhelming, sweet, romantic.",I borrowed a friends before going out and got loads of compliments! Its not overwhelming and doesn't cause that perfume headache you get from others. It's subtle and sweet with a fresh smell. I just love it! And the little crown that comes in top is adorable! You cant go wrong.
4,Pheromone2100,"Recent scientific studies indicate that others may be drawn to us through a scent that we do not even know we exude. Imagine if your scent could be bottled up and used on another person to make you irresistable to them. This is exactly what happens in this novel by Jack Karasch. Throw in a little romance, suspense, and you are off to a good evening of reading!"
2,not even good sex,"When we exited the theatre we were asked to turn in our comment cards. Neither my friend nor I could answer the question,""What did you like best about the film?"" There was nothing I liked, except the music and hearing the gorgeous Italian language. ""What did you like least?"" The emptiness, the story, the confusion at the beginning as to who was with whom and what were they doing? The wasted lives, the selfcenteredness made me sad. If I could see some lessons learned or redeeming values I'd give it a recommendation, but I see none. Sorry, because I usually love Italian films and saw some fine actors wasting their time on a mediocre script."
2,Disappointed.,Document Records has taken their excellent reputation and trashed it by releasing their titles as CD-R's. I actually wrote them long ago about this. I got the argument that a CD-R is equivalent to a regular manufactured aluminum CD. I know that's not the case and told them so. I won't have a problem with this practice if they actually disclosed it (how about on the artwork - duh) but they have failed to do so. For this reason I use to avoid buying their new stuff and forgot and got burned again with a CD-R. So buyer beware with regards to Document Record CDs. Chances appear to be very good that you'll get a CD-R and won't be told. This has been going on for years to the best of my knowledge.
2,abba live and poorly engineered,Half of the album has been engineered by quite poor standards. The hits are there but at least the drum sounds must be remastered. Why not the bass too. That's for the open-eyed abba fans of course.
3,An ok movie,"If you are purchasing this movie to see Keira Knightly's breasts, make sure you don't blink as you will miss them.Otherwise the movie is good"
1,ugh,"First of all, keira should thank the casting person that put her sorry @ss in that soccer movie in England. She is plain, boring, flat-chested, and eerily identical to Natalie Portman- I can't tell them apart. I hate preformers and actresses like that- look just like everyone else, very no-identity so often play good girls. The annoying kind.And Thora! This is why you aren't getting good roles in good movies! Toplessness and non-stop sex scenes do not an actress make. Use your talent and throw away porny scripts!So anyways I hate when the end of a movie starts at the beginning and then proceeds to play backwards. Why show things that didn't happen?? Why make a movie half in the past , half in the current time?? It was too much; made me nauseous. Reccommended for teenagers and empty headed early-twenties. If you want sex scenes, rent a porno not a movie."
5,It is the best story I have ever read.,"I think you would like Paddle-to-the-Sea. It is about a little boy who whittled a little guy named Paddle in a canoe. Paddle sails through the Great Lakes which are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron. I think you would really like Paddle-to-the-Sea."
3,This book was So-So.,"I read Paddle-to-the-Sea with my 4th grade class. I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would. We did fun projects with Paddle-to-the-Sea. At home we had to make a board game using Paddle-to-the-Sea. That was my favorite project with Paddle. I didn't think this book kept my intrest that much. Sometimes while reading this book I felt as if I would fall asleep. If you've read Paddle or any other Holling C. Holling books, good. If you didn't read some. I also saw the movie Paddle in class. It stunk! The book was much better. Try reading the book and watching the movie and doing a comparsion. We did. Bye! And try to read Paddle. Maybe order it from amazon."
3,I think this book is ok.,I think this book teaches you about native amereicans.I only gave this book a 5 . I like it because Paddle has so many adventures.
4,Good book!,"I think Paddle- To - The- Sea was a very good book! It was also very complicated, too. I thought the illustrations we're very beautiful! I always would wonder what happen next. Holling Clancy Holling is a very good author. And if you like the book, the movie is very good. Holling Clancy Holling has other books too. I would really like to read them!"
5,I think this a very good book.,I gave this book a ten because it teaches about the Great Lakes. This book is about a boy with a dream to have a canoe travel to the sea. Mr. Holling wrote other books like Seabird and Tree in the Trail.
4,Too dark for 5 stars,"Longish...and pretty dark, but ultimately redemptive. Enjoyed the movie with my spouse, but the bad guys were more violent than I thought really necessary to make the point of despicable evil. The Blu-Ray would be spectacular and Batman's vehicles are fun to watch. Interesting story and good characters, too. I think you'll like it."
4,Lots of action,"Good movie, good plot, great action scenes.i would recommend this to my friends. It's is a family friendly movie that is fun for everyone."
4,How many ways can they show batman?,"Lots of action and some sentiment. My son-in-law couldn't wait for this movie to come out, and he loves it. I do think its better than the last batman series."
1,BAD PLOT: Too Bad: Love Nolan,"Boring and predictable. I was really disappointed because I love Nolan and loved the other Batman films. This was just really bad, the villain became monotonous and annoying, and I struggled to finish it."
1,No iTunes Digital Copy,"I love the movie, but giving this 1 star since the digital copy is ultra violet only and doesn't work on iTunes. I hate it that they try to force this UV on us when iTunes works far nicer (out of all these online movie stores the only one that still works is iTunes - the rest keep folding - disney's store being the latest example - but at least they gave you an itunes copy as well so it doesn't affect me)."
2,this movie is HORRIBLE,"I couldn't wait to watch this movie,after viewing it I wanted to send it back. Trust me this movie is the worst batman movie made. Don't even think of buying it"
3,Doesn't leave you wanting more.,"Some good stuff in this movie, but by the end I was really ready for it to be over. I was debating turning it off and watching the end in the morning. Not a good sign."
3,"Movie okay -- small media, maybe not.","This was the first movie I ordered on my Kindle -- it was so dark that it was difficult to see in the car where I watched it. In fact, I'm having a hard time remembering the story line at this time. A kindle doesn't do it justice. If you want to watch it, get a bigger screen with better sound available."
1,Not a Batman Movie,"The product listed above is a great product. It shines in HD cinematic glory. So, if you are interested in seeing this movie, Amazon Instant Video is a great way to go.The reason for the Title is: It's a nearly 3 hour movie, with 33 minutes of Batman in it (SPOILER. most of it is him getting his butt kicked.). It does not directly follow the Dark Knight movie. (at the ending of Dark Knight we are told that Batman must be chased because he is the hero we need right now.) This would lead us to believe the next movie would pick up with the police chasing Batman. SPOILER ALERT!!! It picks up 8 years later.) It's filled with plot holes.)Lastly, the dialogue is brilliant if....You have suntitles, which amazon Instant video does nopt yet provide. You will only understand 2/3rds of wehat Bane says. I just saw this yesterday with subtitles and found out he has the best lines. So if you are going to purchase this, get it on Blu-Ray."
1,Ultraviolet is HORRIBLE!,The movie is unbelievably awesome! 5 stars! Absolutely love it. But Ultraviolet is a HORRIBLE service. No stars for it. I could not even download this movie. I have lost all my other movies on flixster. The customer service is AWFUL! I can't recommend buying the bluray if you want a digital copy too. iTunes works flawlessly. Shame.
2,Bane Who?,"I'll admit, I'm not a DC fan. So I've never even heard of Bane. I suspect I am not the only one. They would have been better off choosing a villain people have actually heard of.The plot was drawn out and hard to follow. This movie should have been cut down to about 2 hours. The fight scene between Bane and Batman was lame; if all it took to defeat Bane was a few punches to his face, why didn't Batman do that in the first place?As usual, Christian Bale's exaggerated vocal performance was just silly. Between his throaty rasp and Bane's mask, I found a lot of the dialogue difficult to understand. I probably didn't miss much though.The only positive point to this movie--other than the obvious: special effects--was [SPOILER ALERT] the introduction of Robin at the end.If you're a hardcore Batman fan, you'll probably love this movie. Otherwise, you might want to pass."
2,My Opinion,"It was not for me, for my grandson on Christmas, I saw it but I did not like it but my little one did, thanks"
2,Movie was Ok but transfer over the web was not.,I chose this rating because the way the movie was transfered made it very small on my tv. It is new for them to come over that way. Makes it hard to watch and is distracting to have so much screen black. It was not allowed to change the tv setting. As I said we have rented movies for years on line and it is only recently we noted the change.
4,Great ending for the Batman saga,"Didn't see it at theatre because reviewers talked about it being so dark, but I really enjoyed it. Anne Hathaway was great. Loved the ending."
2,"Too long, Too boring",The Batman series is done. The fake accent on Christian Bale was very annoying and the move was WAY too long.
2,Repeat,"This seems to me to be a repeat of the first movie, where Bruce Wayne must summon the inner strength to become Batman. The story is convoluted and takes far too long to get to the point."
5,I love Batman,I was always a Batman fan I wish this movie was done a little different but in a since this was the end of this series I hope the next 10 years they'll come up with some amazing stuffI recommend this to anyone
5,Wow!!!,"A must have for any movie fan! Great acting, directing, special effects and so on!!! I hop Nolan makes another one!!!Another instant classic!!!"
1,Horrible Digital Copy!,"The digital copy contained in this pack is for use with an application called Flixster ONLY!! Yes, the movie can be downloaded to your computer, and moved to an tablet or phone, however, it has to have the Flixster app to watch your digital copy. This means no watching via your AppleTV or Android/Other bases TV streaming device, unless you can get the Flixster app. This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Warner Brothers account, and a Flixster account. If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes. This was a very sad attempt at Warner Brothers for trying to make the consumer buy another copy of the movie. Several other companies are doing it as well, such as Sony."
3,Definitely for Batman fans,"I'll just start out by saying I'm not necessarily a Batman fanatic. I love a good super hero. I love a good action movie. I like Christian Bale; Love Anne Hathaway; Love Gary Oldman; Love Michael Caine. Heck, I'm a HUGE Pittsburgh Steelers fan and actually bought the commemorative Hines Ward action figure before even seeing this movie There's a lot to like about The Dark Knight Rises. But, it just didn't do it for me. I was disappointed in Bale's performance this time around. Anne Hathaway couldn't have been any sexier. I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt. But, this film just couldn't bring out the super hero fan in me. I thought the script was really bad. Tom Hardy's Bane was annoying. Half the time, we couldn't make out what he was saying. The action was lame. I don't know....for all the hype and how popular this film was, I'm very disappointed."
3,Meh,"Rented this movie through my Vizio 60"" LED tv. Opted for the HD version for $1 more - it honestly looked worse than a standard DVD. Right between VHS quality & coax cable.. But can't complain for $3"
2,"Overly long, too much mysticism","The move was overly long and kind of dull, with too much mystic crap thrown in, though I preferred it to the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher directed movies, which were just weird for the sake of being weird."
4,Not A Dark Knight Fan,"I love Batman but just cannot get into the whole Dark Knight story line. Sorry, that's me. I LOVE Christian Bale. Loved Heath Ledger as the Joker. I own all three films. Not ga-ga about any of them. My family LOVES them. Great! I just, like them. So you should probably pay more attention to them. I'm just not much into the blow 'em up films with oodles of special effects and maybe that is why I don't love these. Not sure."
5,You have my permission...,"Christian Bale does exactly as he has for the last two movies, and that's good. He is a constant in this trilogy, and like any good superhero movie, just when you think he's down, he will get right back up. But like Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, I think what is really worth watching is Tom Hardy putting a different spin on Bane. He's not the mindless minion you say in comic books or cartoons. This is a genius, with a wit and endurance, speed and agility to rival the war-torn batman.Oh, and yes, Liam Neesom is in this as well."
3,Wayyyyyyyyyyy too long,"Frankly, I got bored during this movie. It is too long, and I was disappointed withChristian Bale changing his voice when he ""became"" Batman. It passed the time, butI wouldn't recommend this movie to someone unless they want to sit for almost 3 hours and take a nap."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,There's seems to be a curse when it comes to to the last of a superhero trilogy. We saw it in the third Chris Reeves' Superman movie and in the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Mcquire. The Chris Nolan Batman movies I'm afraid suffers the same fate. The second Chris Nolan Batman is without a doubt the best Superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight). These shoes were impossible to fill with the late great Heath Legder's brilliant Joker probably the best movie villain of all times. Unfortunely the Dark Knight Rises is a dissapointment with a hardly discernable villain in Bain played by the gifted Tom Hardy whose motives and visage are ill defined. The plot has mores hole in it than a swiss cheese factory and the twist at the end makes no sense. Rest easy dear Heath you will never be surpassed.RegardsPerry Greenberg
2,Was Long,The DVD stopped in the middle 4 times. It was a new one. The movie itself was not as good as other Batman movies.
2,Forget it,"Worst of the Batman series of movies....could not even sit through it! If spending money on a movie rental, I need something to hold my attention."
1,Not a good movie,Batman was supposed to be a hero and this movie makes him out to be the bad guy. It was too dark and I did not like it.
3,I liked this movie,"Loved the ""climbing up out of the depths"" analogy. These sequels aren't always good but this one I enjoyed.Check it out."
4,worth the watch,"it was a great movie, I wish cat woman would of had a little bit of a bigger part MEOW BABY!"
1,UV Digital Copy? NOT WORTH IT.,"I bought this before I realized that it was an UltraViolet Digital Copy. They are the worst! It's a miserable experience watching the UV Digital Copies - you can't download them onto an iPad, and watching it on the iPad is miserable. It doesn't stream well - constant skips and hesitations, and the screen quality suddenly downgrades itself for no reason. I bought Amazing Spider Man because of the digitial copy and regretted it. Just got the Bluray in the mail, and I'm sending it back to Amazon. Ultraviolet is miserable. I'm going to buy it right from iTunes. Fewer special features, but the extra commentaries (that I'll never listen to) aren't worth a miserable viewing experience.This doesn't even mention that the Bluray disc that I received doesn't work in my player. Fail."
5,Dark Knight,The best of the Batman so far.....Ann Hathaway was just amazing to watch......can't wait for the next one......bring on the dynamic duo.....
3,Ok movie,I thought this movie was ok. I did not think it was a great movie. There's times when I sort of lost interest but would get back into it.
2,No More Batman!,I am relieved to know that this will probably be the LAST batman movie to be filmed because it was HORRIBLE!
4,Great!,"Very good in concept and production. I enjoyed the extras, but wonder how much more the Batman franchise can produce in quality in the future."
5,Great stocking stuffer!,My fiance loved the attractive case and the fact this movie came with digital edition + blu ray. He's a big movie fan!
2,don't waste your time and money,This movie was quite disappointing. The plot was weak and it severely lacked cohesiveness and character development. Definitely a let down compared to the previous movies in the trilogy. I put it on par with the earlier batman movies which were boring and ridiculous. Additionally it was WAY too long.
3,dark like the comics,Enjoyed the characters. I wish the CG artists would pay closer attention to physics. Plot made up for CG failures. Not bad overall & I would reccomend this to any Fan.
2,boring,Boring. Long and choppy story and where were all of Batmans cool toys? Batarangs and stuff.Missing- Bad acting too-my recommendation is Miss This Movie
2,Batman and villain DULL DULL DULL,Lost flow and excitement of previous movies! Scripted more like a television show than a hollywood production.Dialog also seemed rushed
3,Had to watch to complete the trilogy,"And that was the only reason to watch it because various people told me that it was not a good movie. And yes, it was a mediocre movie. Unnecessary long, with the plot doing a few deeps towards boredom, and reaching a conclusion that was really bad.In general, it has the Batman quality, but there are James-Bond-like scenes that make it out of touch with the series. Also, there is too much soul searching etc at the expense of action. And let's not talk about the bravado / patriotic scenes.I was disappointed and of course suffered from my wife's nagging at the end (""You make me watch boring movies instead of watching Ice Age 4"")!But if you are a fun of the series you will find some good things, for example new toys, and all in all it is a an OK conclusion to the trilogy, and I guess the startof the Robin series"
2,Flop!,This movie wasn't even in the same league as Dark Knight. Poorly written and badly directed. I hope it's done better next time.
3,Plotholes,"If you can suspend disbelief long enough to look past all the blaring plot holes and general awful decision making skills on both sides, then you might like his movie."
2,Way too long and unintelligible,"Nothing good to say about this one. A seemingly interminable movie with an unfollowable plot, starring a guy who beats up his mother in real life. Avoid this turd like the plague."
4,Very Good Follow up to a suburb second film...,"Here is the deal, The Dark Knight was, i feel, the best movie in 10 years. It was well thought out, acted well, and visually stunning.Now that being said I expected this film to end up like Return of the Jedi, a okay movie that wrapped up everything in a nice bow, and ewoks. I have to say i was really surprised at this ending, so much so that this three set of movies along with Batman Begins may be my new favorite trilogy of movies. While not as mind blowing as The Dark Knight was for me, I have absolutely no issues how this movie ended and honestly I loved the last few scenes the most.If you saw the other two you have to see this no matter what everything you read says."
1,Barf,"I didn't even finish watching the movie, but then, I've never really been into Batman. Take or leave it? Leave it!"
4,Couldnt wait to add this to my collection!!,"I have been a huge Batman fan since I was a kid. From the comics, to the movies, to the cartoons and the games, but I absolutely loved this series the most. This series really hit the darker side of Batman and gave it a little more of a realistic touch. Batman The Dark Knight Rises, in my opinion, made Bane one of the scariest, most intense villains in any super hero movie I've seen in 2012. I think this movie did a great job ending this specific series, and even still it left me wanting more, but I was very satisfied with the ending. It was intense, fun, and even amusing at times. All around I think its a great movie, a great series and for me it was a definite buy! Hope everyone else can enjoy this movie/series as much as I did."
3,I want my iTunes digital copy option back!!!,"The movie's just okay. Lots of HUGE leaps of logic and plot holes you could drive a tumbler through. Still worth buying for the sheer fun of seeing the conclusion to an epic run of Batman movies.With that said, the Ultraviolet only digital copy offer has got to go. I (and nearly everyone else I talk to) hates that we can't download the iTunes copy if we so choose. I don't even buy the movie with a digital copy anymore if ultraviolet is my only option. The studios / distributors are leaving money on the table and alienating a lot of fans with this."
2,A Batman Movie Without Much Batman,"Wow. I thoroughly disliked this movie. I suppose it was even more disappointing after The Dark Knight. In my opinion, this was a long, tediously boring film that had Batman in it very little overall. The only interesting character who had any significant development and decent screen time was Catwoman. I recommend that anyone interested in this movie rent it before buying. I wish I had."
5,The Final Chapter,The movie provided an excellent end to the Batman saga. We'll watch them all in a row now to the final ending.
2,Not like the comic book style batman movies of the past,"my husband, my daughter and me all fell asleep! too hard to follow, much darker than the typical Batman movie. The villan's story was confusing, and sort of a mystery until the end. When his story was revealed the villain went from a leader to a lost little puppy in a second. We didnt like it at all."
3,fast and easy transaction,This movie was not as good as the first two but a movie that should have been better had the chance to be great but writers dropped the ball on what could be the last Dark Knight but left it open for what will be a flop the boy wonder unless they keep going with this line up.
4,good!,This was a good movie and it played very well on the Kindle. We bought it for our vacation flight time and it was really handy.
3,Ultraviolet Boo!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great movie and I cannot wait to buy it. However, this ultraviolet ""digital copy stuff is crap"". I want the iTunes copy for my iPhone and iPad.Three stars +5 for the movie - 2 for the ultraviolet garbage therefore product gets three stars."
1,Wasn't this like 35 dollars new at Walmart?,"You people reselling this for over a hundred bucks are scum, some of us actually want to collect this and not just turn a profit."
1,Not a real digital copy,You can't download the movie. You can only stream it from a website. No Internet=no movieI won't be buying anymore uv products
5,Awesome!,I have watched every single one of the Batman movies and I have t say that this one is right up there with The Dark Knight. I loved Tom Hardy's Bane and I think Anne did Selina Kyle justice. The movie keeps you on the edge and I absolutely LOVED the twist at the end!
2,I didn't understand.,I am not sure if because of a language problem or because the movie was so dark (as it is indicated in its name) I didn't understand an enjoy this movie.
2,looong!,"I think the movie was way too long, almost boring, it also has too much valiance! I wouldn't recomend it."
1,No Itunes digital copy.,Ultraviolet does not work well and not worth anyone's time or money. I will change my review for this product when there is an itunes digital copy included.
1,Sucks that digital copy is ultraviolet,Great movie! Huge fan of superhero movies but really disappointed with the decision that its gonna be release with that ultraviolet digital copy nonsense.I would buy this movie if it had an iTunes digital copy. The movie hands down deserves a 5 star rating. Ultraviolet digital copy 0 stars
2,The Dark Knight Disappoints,I've given director Nolan and actor Bale three chances...and all three failed to excite. My wife laughs hysterically when I do my imitation of Bale's raspy voice as the billionaire playboy turned crime fighter. This go round of Batman just over-hyped.
5,Best film of the trilogy,"This is the best Batman movie ever made, with the Dark Knight following in a close second. You couldn't have asked for a better ending nor could anyone have made a better one. If you think otherwise, please go ahead and enlighten us with your own ending. I bet it would have sold millions."
5,Great movie,We enjoyed this movie a lot. It was a little slow like the first of the trilogy but very enjoyable.
4,Not the best Bat.,"Compare to the first and second Batman, I'm afraid this one did no come out as it should/could have. The street fight between the cops and the bad guy didn't impress me at all, and the chirography didn't deliver the ""realism"" it should have."
3,rent it.. don't buy it,"seemed thrown together, it was okay but not better than the previous one,all the indecision about being batman, dude... just get over it and get on with the show...,my girlfriend pics a pair of shoes quicker.it was okay to rent, but not to buy."
3,"Hate the pre order, love the movie",I pre ordered the blu ray copy of this film over a month ago. Yet it won't arrive until a week after it hits stores. What is the point of pre ordering a product if you're not going to get it the same day it comes out? Isn't that the point?Great film though. Love TDKR.
2,"All over the place, disappointing :(","(Great opening sequence aside) Takes place eight years after The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne is moping and feeling sorry for himself throughout 90% of the film (Batman is in maybe 10-15% of the film). The entire canvas of the film is epic and themes are weighty, but the script is just too choppy and all over the place. A couple of great action sequences doesn't make up for almost an 2 and a half hours of boredom.You'll read a lot of ""Good"" reviews and most will start off, ""It's no Batman Begins or The Dark Knight but...""Well guess what, you build me up with those great films, I'm gonna expect as good if not better for the finale. This just felt so disconnected."
3,Most thrilling movie.....EVER!!!!,"Uh, this movie was dark, thrilling, and over the top. I don't know how they did some of the special effects in many of the scenes, but everything looked totally real. the music was better in batman begins but the premise is the same. Bane was one scary dude and I am going to have nightmares about him. Didn't love cat woman because she is scrawny and couldn't beat up a pair of socks. Her hair was amazing though. My favorite part was the street fight and the end of the movie.What made this movie great was the realism. We don't struggle with this kind of stuff everyday but tyranny exists in this world. This is the most realistic work of fiction I have ever watched in a movie. Usually its full of magic, creatures, and different worlds. In Batman its the technology that is most unbelievable. The rest only the city of Gotham can hold.Crazy good! Never watching it again."
3,did not enjoy the store line,"did not enjoy the store line because it was very slow to the action...did not enjoy as much as the ones before this one...However, I enjoyed the ending"
3,Not quite up to prior versions,"Expected more as I didn't really have any idea what the plot was about before viewing. Too long for sure, very convoluted and some ""don't make sense"" plot lines and characters. I think producers were really stretching viewer's ""suspension of disbelief"" threshold here. I did like the Cat(woman), but will Michael Caine just hang it up, please? Retire to the old actor's home and have a cigar.Just not as good as the earlier Batman films with Bale as the lead. Too bad. I guess we now see intro of Robin? Or different incarnation of Batman."
4,great movie near bluray quality lacking on subtitles,"Great movie, good quality for a stream. But more than a red box bluray and no options like subtitles. hoping they continue the franchise with Robin . Seemed a little rushed like there could have been a fourth movie."
2,Needs a plot,"It takes more than special effects to create a good movie, you need a strong plot and interesting story line. This movie was lacking in both."
1,Truly Awful,"Our family is truly action-adventure and science fiction movie fans. We were very disappointed in this movie. The plot line jumped from place, and our ability to maintain our suspension of disbelief was thoroughly challenged. Batman/Wayne is not even in a large portion of the movie. There were giant plot holes as they attempted to tie up the storyline. Overall it was too long, the story was poorly written, and even with the action, it was boring. Disappointing."
4,good movie,good movie but liked the dark knight better ..had to have it though to add to the batman collection =)
2,Not so great...,"I love superhero movies, but this one was lame. I wouldn't watch it again at all or recommend it to anyone"
4,The Dark Knight Rises,"This movie was delivered in a timely manner and in great condition. It's a gift so I haven't opened it and as I have not seen the movie myself, I can't say for sure how I feel about it."
3,Great action - stupid plot,The first movie was great and well thought out.This was a series of unrealistic storylines that made no sense to me.
2,"Mostly Boring, with just a touch of ""Its just about to get interesting""","several other reviews on here hit this right on the head. lots of problems with it in terms of it not making much sense. but for me, the deal killer was that I just didnt care. Cat woman? Jeesh, couldn't wait to not see her on the screen. what exactly was the attraction for batman? he ""saw"" the good in her? yea, right. Any dude that gets sold down the river to get beaten to a pulp by a chick, and the original attraction was after she robbed you?i always thought the ras agul stuff didnt make any sense, and of course this doesnt either since its the same thinking.but all in all, who were we supposed to be rooting for? The only likeable person is Alfred. I was rooting for the end.so if i can add one thing to the list of problems with this movie, inherently boring mixed with you will not care. my instincts said skip, but unfortunately curiosity got me. I want my 4 bucks and 3 hours back!"
3,Pretty Good,"Found myself confused at the beginning but then it all made sense. Overall, the best batman movie in my opinion. Makes way for another sequel: Batman and Robin!"
2,Boring,Almost fell asleep. 4 adults watched and none of us liked the slow moving film. Very disappointed in this movie.
4,"Visually dramatic, entertaining, but enigmatic at the end",Dark Knight is visually and musically powerful and enormously entertaining. You won’t be disappointed. Taste may differ about the pace of the story and the coherency of the ending. I thought the special effects were sometimes drowning the plot and that the ending could have bundled the loose ends better without compromising the prospect for a sequel.
1,WTF!? Not UltraViolet BS again!,"I don't know why Warner Brothers is insisting on being anti consumer with this stupid UltraViolet stuff. No watching Dark Knight Rises on my Apple TV, or any other apple devices without an internet connection. I refuse to use Flixster and put myself at the mercy of their license termination. Either rip the movie, or just get it from iTunes."
4,Pretty Good,I have a very short attention span and easily get side tracked. However this film managed to keep my attention all the way through. I would recommend it even if you've never seen the other batman movies.
4,"A big long at times, but still good","The movie does drag a little, and it can be tough to follow, especially because bain is so dang hard to understand, but all in all it's a fitting end to a great trilogy."
4,entertaining,"probably not the best Batman, but it was good. I like the fun nature of Anne Hathaway's character. I think I just missed all the gagets. And the story with the villian was not quite as good as the classic joker, etc. Definitely worth watching if you have a raining afternoon, but dont set specific time aside to see it."
1,boring!,very disappointed. was not all it was made out to be. slow going. i hope the next one is better.
1,Down with UltraViolet!,"UltraViolet doesn't work with iTunes!!! If you're going to sell a digital copy make sure it's at least easily accessible though the most popular digital players. UltraViolet is crap, I will never purchase another BluRay with this format on it again."
2,Very Poorly Done,"If you don't care about basic substance to a film I guess this could be okay. I found it to be a great disappointment.There were too many points that just didn't add up. In the beginning, Bruce is so injured he needs assistance from a mechanical leg device just to function, then after being beaten and thrown in a prison, he is suddenly able to preform as if he is in his peak of health.Did anyone else notice that the pit for prisoners to climb out of actually had a climbable wall both going up from the first platform or going over to the second platform everyone tried jumping to? It seems like someone with batman's skills should have been able to climb across vs. making a leap based on fear. It also did not make sense that no one else could make it out.The physics of the motorcycle he used also annoyed me, but I won't get into that now."
3,"Needed more editing & grit, less quips","Glad we waited to see this till came out on DVD rather than seeing it in the theater...felt like 20 minutes or so could have been cut from the middle of the movie. I read reviews where people complained that Batman didn't show up till 30 minutes in, and then that the ending was great; I felt the opposite, the beginning didn't bother me w/o Batman and the ending felt a bit too trite. Catwoman could have been a lot more edgy and interesting but was WAY too quippy. She was better in the first half. Not nearly as gritty and well-acted as the second movie. Worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece."
1,"Die Ultraviolet, die!","Once again, corporate greed defies customer preference. I think if you want this movie, you're stuck with UV, unless you want to pay more for the storybook version exclusively at Target.Give stupid UV as a choice, rather than a demand, and you''ll sell more Blu-Rays. :-P"
1,"Review of Ultraviolet, not the movie.","Really want to make this purchase, however, I made a purchase once with the Ultraviolet only ""digital copy"" (which is useless unless you have Internet access, when you're ready to watch). I had trouble viewing online, contacted their customer service and they were unwilling to give me a code for ITunes, so that I could at least view what I paid for. Useless! Unless I have the a true digital copy, I'm not paying for the movie. These companies are crazy if they think I feel privileged to watch an online copy of a movie I already paid for, not to mention the fact that the movies expire online. So much for ""watch your movie anywhere, anytime""."
2,Very Disappointing!,"Poor sound quality. Bad special effects. Weak story line. Christian Bale's mouth seemed to be distorted when wearing the costume & quite frankly, Batman was a wimp. Ann Hathaway's performance as Catwoman was a lot better than Bale's. Ending, when we see ""Robin"" go into the Bat-cave, left it open for another yet another Batman movie, which I won't be anxiously waiting for. At least we got the rental from Amazon & $3.99 is a good price to see if a movie is actually worth buying. Very disappointing all the way around."
2,Amazingly Dissapointing,Just watch the last two minutes and you will get the jist of the story. There is little to no character development beyond the reimagining of Robin.
3,"A little long, but still good.","I love the Batman movies, but this one was a little long and had some holes in the plot. I hope the JLA movies are good. DC needs another winning franchise!"
2,Not thrilled,I was really expecting so much from this film. It didn't hold my attention at all; it was very boring.
3,Not the best Batman movie,Not a fan of making Batman a big wuss most of the movie. I know it's fantasy but some of the movie was just ridiculous.
2,couldn't follow the plot,"My teenage son who has loved batman his whole life was frustrated and couldn't follow the plot. Too much was left out and not explained. He was so disappointed, and I was too!Try better next time maybe?"
1,Couldn't stand it.,"I realize that I may be in the minority here, but it is my review. I am a longtime Batman fan and from the Pittsburgh area, so I expected so much more from this movie. The only parts of this movie that had any value to me were the scenes without Bruce Wayne or Batman. Loved Catwoman, Commissioner Gordon, and even Bane (and I expected to hate his character based on casting and other changes to the character). I bought it, watched it, and gave it away."
5,Great Triolgy,"What can you say, this series of Batman movies are the best! Well acted, great story line and it leaves you still wanting more."
5,Best of the trilogy,If instant classic wasn't an oxymoron this would be an instant classic. It's better than the dark night and that is a personal favorite of mine.
4,Epic Ending,"Chirstopher Nolan and Christian Bale have done a great job with this epic trilogy. This is almost as good as the first in the series. Very entertaining, but not the best of the three."
2,Long,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG boring and LOOOOOOOOOOOONG. I watched it in two sittings. But hey Christian I watched Flowers of War and thought it was great.
1,Not a fan of UltraViolet!,"Movie quality is great, amazon prime shipping was great! Gave one star due to ultra violet. I own Apple products, I expect to be able to use a (digital copy) on my device without having to create a flixster and ultra violet account. Contacted UltraViolet and was told the only way to transfer the movie to a device was to create the flixster account and download the app. Maybe not such a big deal, but I've purchased and used many digital copies and have never had to create additional accounts."
3,Not what I expected,"I think they could of developed a better story line for this movie. Also, Anne H. at Cat Woman just doesn't look right. She played the part well, but its just not the type of role for her."
5,Very entertaining,"As president Obama said, Ann Hathaway as Catwoman is the best; amazing actress. As far as entertainmnet is concerned, one can't be miss with a movie like that. How Bruce Wayne is able to do Batman with severe arthritis is medically speaking very intriguing."
4,a fitting conclusion to the trilogy,I liked Nolan's interpretation of Batman since 'Begins'. I really liked the fact that he kept the character and movies grounded in reality. Everything is completely plausible and possible and believable. This is one of the more solid trilogies that I have witnessed.
4,I liked it,Character development was great. The Bain character is the toughest villain Batman has ever faced. Special effects did an excellent job as well. Very good.
2,Ok ending,Really Really long and tedious the middle stretches out this kind of boring but the ending was good. You should watch if you seen the other two as it closes everything out
4,pretty good movie except...,There was way too much political crap in this movie. The storyline was good and it was a good conclusion to this series. I do hope that this really isn't the end as this was the best batman series yet.
5,Awesome piece,"I bought this item about a month ago. It arrived in 1 day, so the shipping is superfast. It looks awesome In the packaging and really great on a display. It was sealed in the box and only lower left bottom of the back corner was dinged. It was one of the last ones they had. I am envy of some people in Augusta since they are now sold out. I smile every time I look at it at my movie shelf. In the eye of a collector it is priceless. The piece is one of a kind and well worth getting...:)"
1,Great movie! Terrible pairing with UltraViolet,This review is for the fact that The Dark Knight Rises has paired with UltraViolet to limit consumer usability. The movie is great! UltraViolet needs to go away forever and never rise again.
1,WHERE'S THE MOVIE?,Didn't include the actual Blu Ray Movie with mine! Can't replace it because its limited edition so I have to return it and went to Best Buy to buy a copy. THANKS!
4,Love the Blu-Ray dislike UltraVioletHD digital copy,The movie is great but I really dislike the UltraVioletHD digital copy format as it does not work with my devices and is just a pain to setup/use. I should have just looked for a version without it and paid less money if possible.
5,great movie all around,"the movie ties together and wraps up (sort of) the triolgy nicely. good action, great story, very well delivered by the actors."
4,not your typical batman,excellent plot twist had me saying wow i didn't see that coming left a good opening for sequel in the future
3,I can always do without Ultraviolet,"A lot of these movies nowadays come with the Ultraviolet copy and I am one of those people who doesn't want to go into clouds to watch movies. If you are too cheap to include an actual digital copy, you can do without this garbage as well"
2,Worst Batman Movie I can Recall,"Bad acting, Too Long, Poor Character Development, Mediocre Story, The only redeeming factor is the special effects were pretty good."
2,movie skipped the whole time,The movie itself was good but the quality was awful. We had to start the movie over a few times. Very frustrating.
4,Good Entertainment,Good. Plenty of twists and turns to keep you watching. The actors were great. Worth watching again. And I don't watch many movies twice.
4,"If you liked the Dark knight, you will like this one.","It's a pretty good show. Lots of action and effects. I didn't give it 5 stars cause I would like a little more depth, but, overall,it is a very entertaining show."
4,DVD fine; Ultra-Violet not for me,I am not an iTunes fan so the hoops I had to jump thru to get my digital copy really put me off.The DVD is great; worth the money. Just wish getting a digital copy was a more straight forward process.
2,Basically a waste of a few hours,"Enjoyed a few parts, but overall a weak film. The story was slow, and Bane was really hard to understand."
2,Digital Copy is a joke!,"i like the move. i like the way the movie arrive (packaged well, quickly). I HATE the digital copy-of lack there of.We bought this version for the digital copy (we don't have blu-ray, but it was the only version with a DC), but we can't access it. AT ALL. First, ultraviolet does not let you go through itunes unless you have a specific code, which they do not give you. ok, fine so i have to go through a different app that i have to download and do a bunch of other things with. Ok fine, did that. when we entered the digital code in the flickster app, as directed, the code said it had already been used. mind you we bought this BRAND NEW from amazon. and UltraViolet has the WORST customer service. As in it is completely non-existant. We emailed and tried to call and have got nothing in return. this was a wasted purchase for us since our only interest is in the digital copy and DVD."
3,Good Batman Movie,"Overall I found the movie to be entertaining but in several parts the dialouge was so soft and low I had to turn up the volume to hear what they were saying, then BLAM the volume was too loud. I sat with the remote in my hand to adjust the volume on different scenes. Not a bad movie, but I doubt I'll add this one to my collection."
3,Not the Best of the Series,"A good followup to the prior release, but Bane is no where near what Ledger's Joker brought to the screen."
4,everybody allways lives,"i read the comics first.movies are allways a mixture of stories from the comics.that is unless a director thinks our boys need nipples or codpieces.batman stories are kinda like star trek.only the people that wont be in a story later will die.the villians will continue to come back forever.therefore appearing in batmans life over and over.the comics reflect this,and theres no reason the movies shouldnt do this too.as each writer and artist gives us a new tangent on the joker im allways frothing for the experience.i like the darker batman...he has to be that way.i like new stories that are connected to my comics.bring on all the new stuff!!! dont wait for the justice league just turn batman around by 2014!!!"
5,Best Batman,"This was a wonderfully made movie the acting was great and the plot was intense. The only people who don't like this movie are either the tards that are comic book fanatics or the ones who think that Michael Keaton was the bomb :) I do like Michael keaton, his version was cartoony and corny while this version was for the grownups."
3,O.K. movie,"I'm a fan of the Batman movies, but this one didn't blow me away. In terms of streaming, I had no problems watching it live through Amazon with my Roku device."
3,Meh,"it was pretty good, and worth watching once. Probably not ever again though. It's your typical high dollar blockbuster. Words."
3,Dark night,"This one is good but no where near the last one. The villain sucked compared to the joker. The Joker set the bar!The last Barman was FANTASTIC!!! I would watch it again in a minute. But this one, one time was enough. Batgirl. Looser! But they picked the wrong actress for batgirl.Robin was good! But Batgirl stunk!"
5,Great movie,Movie was great actually the best batman movie and for a movie that is almost 3 hours long I think 14 dollars are worth it.
4,Best I have seen in a while.,Good movie. Enjoyed it very much. The Dark Knight Rises lived up to the hype. Probably the best of the Batman shows.
1,horrible!!!!,the 3 hours worn losses!!!all dark knight batman seem directed by Quentin Tarantino!!!seems the decline of the Dark Knight!horrible!!!
4,Best of the Series,First let me say this is a review of the movie and the Blu Ray combo. UltaViollet is horrible. New way for the Hollywood machine to screw you over.If you want the digital copy buy it on Amazon in HD.
3,Could have been better,"I'm glad they concluded the Dark Knight but it just seem they stretch too long and felt like Batman needed a better respected villain than Talia or Bane. Plus IN MY OPINION it didn't fit because Bane is a Mercenary and Talia is Ra's Al Gul's daughter. I just don't see how they fit? Probably I'm used to the original story? I feel like one of the top villains like Riddler, or Penguin. Some one with a enough power and juice that was present in DKR, Again that's my opinion"
3,Dark Knight rises and falls,"The 2nd movie unfortunately robs the third any opportunity to come close to the suspense and tension that you felt with the Joker. On its own, the action or lack of it left you wanting the Joker or for that matter any villain other than Bane to shake things up. Bane would have been better had his terror been better fleshed out and Batman less whiny. You just felt wanting Batman to rise early rather than later."
4,Fascinating excursion into second person narritave,The entire book is written as one side of a dialog; there are few surprises (he telegraphs the ending by the first quarter of the book) but it is so well written that you don't mind. Not quite up to Instance of hte Fingerpost or Dream of Scipio but still great fun.
3,Lower your expectations,"The problem with being Sammy Sosa or the author of Instance of a Fingerpost is that you are expected to hit it out of the park each time. If you were disappointed when you picked up Gregory MacDonald's novels expecting another Fletch or reading one of Iain Pears detective mysteries, then this brief rewrite of the Casque of Amontillado will leave you thinking ""is that all there is?"""
1,Call Me Superficial,This is a deep and complex book. And unless you're really committed I wouldn't reccomend getting into this.
5,Fabulous!,"This invaluable book covers all aspects of beautiful hand sewing and is usable and adaptable for any kind of garment. The book covers all the basic stitches, and that information alone is incredibly valuable. This book enables me to buy garments at a flee market that are either damaged, don't quite fit, or are made out of an incredible fabric, and rework them! It is sad that there are so few resources for hand sewing on the market and this one is just fabulous."
2,Dated Genre,"I want to have it down for the record that I do enjoy fusion from Miles' 70's stuff to Sonny Sharrock to early Gil Evans to many of today's Knitting Factory experimentalists such as John Zorn. Atlantic Jazz: Fusion takes the easy route however and presents us with examples of what gave fusion a bad name. Endless riffing and little substance that does justice to neither rock or jazz. Fusion destroyed jazz by burying it in half baked stereotypes and as a result jazz jumped back to hard bop revisionism. Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw and Donald Byrd and countless other musicians at the time successfully added electric aspects to their music without detracting from its substance (at least at first). This compilation though is heavy on the name dropping and light on the musical integrity."
4,Wonderful Breakout 1st album,"With a mixure of pop, jazz r&b, motown, and, yes, even lullubies, Jeff Timmons presents a mature sound above & beyond 98 Degrees. Listen to Baby J, Whisper That Way, Rainbow, Angel Eyes, & Better Days. His voice soars to new heights while blending with an assortment of musical types. It isn't the best I've ever heard from Jeff Timmons - he was incredible when solo at the Jim Brickman Holiday concert winter '03 - but the CD is worth the money. I find myself humming along with Better Days, I know Baby J by heart and have cracked my voice on Whisper That Way. Some songs I tap my toes to, others I will admit I ignore but compared with 85% of the new stuff on the market, it is wonderful to get an album clean, smart, and with something for everyone. Good work, Jeff. I will be looking forward to your second album while I continue to enjoy this one."
5,Beautiful watch at a great price.,"This was a gift for a person who likes green. The price was extremely good and when the watch arrived I was amazed at the quality. It was a deep, lush green color, with complimentary gold; quite stunning for a casual watch. I will keep a look-out for more of these watches."
2,Formatting makes it hard too read,"This is a comment on the kindle version.The book is difficult to read, as sections of text are missing or shifted around. There are headings which relate to side notes, which are placed within the text, as well as page numbers from the original paper version.I cannot really make much comment on the book itself. It was too difficult to read, I didn't go past reading the sample. This really lets down what may have been a good book, and it has received plenty of good reviews."
2,"Good preformance, U2 getting to much of the mainstream.","This DVD live at slane castle is marred by unpleasant ""All that you can't leave behind"" tracks, which is where U2 have started to become a failure, and very predictable.Especially with this how to dismantle an atomic bomb album, and vertigo tour.It would of been nicer to of seen a setlist containing more of their proper tunes.Bad? Stay? Electric Co.? Still have'nt found? Desire? Exit? Mofo?, c'mon!!! Why ditch it so you can ""reconnect with your audience??!!"" thats not music!! Lots of people like POP!!"
5,I was there!,"First of all let me say I have been a U2 fan since 1983 and back then when I was 15 I wanted to see U2 play in Ireland. That dream came true when I got to see them at this concert. I was just outside the heart stage and let me tell you, nothing beats 80,000 screaming fans! The emotion was evident when Bono talked about his father and the Edge's father Bono's father died the week before) it was a very emotional show on many levels. I had been to a few other U2 concerts and nothing beat the atmosphere in this particular one. I watch it now and again and relive that day from getting up at 5am to get the bus to Slane from Limerick to being there for an all day show that started at noon time and finished at midnight to stumbling into bed at 6 am the next day. A dream fulfilled and will never be forgotten! The Boston show was good but this one is way better!"
5,U2 Go Home Live From Slane Castle,"I'm not a big U2 fan but this is an amazing concert DVD. DTS is a must. Full of energy and feeling. Click to ""KITE"" turn it up and play it over and over again."
5,Simply Incredible,After watching this DVD I said to my wife that I thought I discovered gold. The DVD is amazing throughout and the Bonus track when Bono's daughter Eve comes on stage and dances to Mysterious Ways is awesome. Go buy it.
4,Handy printer,"This compact printer will handle anything a normal-size printer can do. I found the wireless feature difficult to connect to, and finally went with the USB connection. Not as small as I wanted, but full of features. Rather heavy to pack for travel."
5,First compact disc I ever bought,"Yep, Target didn't have JP Turbo when I wanted it. I settled for Dancin Undercover. Didn't care much for Dance at the time, but this album kicked my ass! The whole thing is great! Was a RATT fan before this. Enough Is Enough is Enough to buy it for. Do it!"
3,Average Ratt album,Ratt put out other CD's which were more interesting and original than this one. DANCING UNDERCOVER is mostly for Ratt fans.
1,Doesn't fit V171,Waited three weeks for delivery and when it arrived it doesn't fit my Motorola V171. Ordered one last spring and it worked just fine. It looks like they changed vendors.
1,buy something else -- trust me,Black / yellow print head failed twice -- getting customer support to send me a new one was a lengthy and tedious process -- so much in fact that the second time it failed I didnt even bother -- I just paid the $79. Clearly more cost effecting than submitting to the 2 hour long 'do this do that' routine. Paper handling is awful -- constantly skips pages. Almost out of ink on all cartridges and then it is going in the ole dumpster.
1,this printer is a total lemon,"From day one of owning this printer I knew I had made a big mistake. A) It is very loud. B) It consumes a lot of time making noise calibrating something, testing something, spitting out pages that aren't printed. C) When you run any of the self diagnostics, it consumes a lot of paper, ink, and time. D) The inks are expensive. E) The printheads are expensive (and why do you need to replace them? - the printheads of all my Epson printers never need any replacement). The only good thing to say is the machine's print quality, but that doesn't make up for all the time and money wasted. This printer is so poorly designed, it convinced me to never buy a HP product again."
4,Overall Reasonably Good,"I bought this set a couple of years ago...it is pretty good overall. The second CD is undeniably better than the first. ""Deepest Blue"", ""Burned With Desire"" and ""Pretty Green Eyes"" are the highlights in this set. Not the best, but better than average."
3,"Ah, the 80's....","A nice little effort from a group that is no doubt considered a ""one-hit wonder"" of the 1980's.Aside from rather inane lyrics (an attribute hardly unique to Nu Shooz), there are a couple of catchy tunes to enjoy on this CD."
3,Nu Shooz a little scuffed,"I've had this disc for... good god... almost 20 years! Every once in awhile I have this urge to hear it and when I do, I play it for days.This is a good, not great disc, thanks to their monster hit ""I Can't Wait"", and its even better follow-up ""Point of No Return"". The rest of the songs are pleasantly forgettable. Some of the lyrics are downright cringe inducing (""Put a dollar in your cup/when I saw that you were blind""?!? Hey, thanks for the help, Val...) and Valerie Day's nasal vocals can get on one's nerves, though.Sometimes I swear this is a concept album about communication as the telephone gets mentioned in almost every single song..."
3,Nu Shooz - Where are they now?,"Valerie Day and husband John Smith rode the whirlwind of their 80's pop success to its logical end, and wound up right where they began: as beloved local music stars here in their home town of Portland, Oregon. Valerie is now performing jazz standards with other notable locals including the Woody Hite Big Band, Tom Grant, Big Horn Brass and others. She's also very active in promoting/supporting arts programs in the schools, and is a founder of Artists for the Arts (www.artistsforthearts.org). I think John is still arranging and producing most of Valerie's recordings."
1,Not for improvement...,"This DVD is not an instructional DVD. You won't learn anything with it. There is few tabs of riffs that Flea is playing in it, but they realy are no use...This DVD is fun if you would like to see Flea when he was younger and if you like this guy. This inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute...If you want to improve your playing, purchase something else. If you wan't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you won't learn to play, this might be for you..."
4,"could be better,but it's bernie so dig it!","pretty awesome for what it is!it would've been cool to have a pro dissect bernie's style,phrasing,etc,but what you get with this cd is still cool.the part where bernie gets the guy in the club for free as his guest was cool,and shows how much of a freindly guy he is.the dvd is more about bernie as a person than explaining his music intricately."
5,Awesome Achievement,"al-Azmeh's book is half-comparative and half-chronology of the development of Muslim conceptions of Kingship. This work thoroughly puts to rest notions of Muslim exceptialionism by demonstrating the polyvalence of kingship discourse as well as its the various exchanges, borrowings, and influences adapted from Byzantine and Persian concepts of kingship. He takes considerable steps to remove the exotic from Muslim Kingship to instead place it within the framework of its evolving historical environment throughout the middle ages. It is a rare work that combines broadstrokes with a stringent concern for accuracy and nuance."
3,Wrong Pole Color,"This umbrella is an excellent value. However, the pole color for the forest green one is neither ""taupe"" nor ""bronze"" as is stated twice in the description. It is painted dark green and looks odd with a light colored table.The fabric seems to be a good quality and the mechanism works well. Too much trouble to send back just for the pole color but I am disappointed."
3,Clinging to Hope,"One of the most comprehensive personal narratives of the Japanese/Indo POW experience relayed through the eyes of a young Indo woman.This type of narrative is normally read by those with a specific interest in the Indo experience of Japanese occupation, and this one is very satisfying in the detail it gives of what happened to those captured, those left behind, the survivors and the participants in the war drama.It would have benefitted from having an editor tighten the story, a spell check and a smaller font, but for content and story line it was really enlightening about the period in question, which is why I searched it out and read it."
3,No 5.1,"Not bad, I liked Live Aus Berlin much better, but if you are a Rammstein fan, buy it. Know that 5.1 is not available on this DVD. It is on the menu, but if you select 5.1, you will get a message that says 5.1 is not available. Instead, you will get multi-channel Pro Logic.The audio is not done well, levels change from track to track. I expected more given that Live Aus Berlin is 5.1 and has overall reference quality audio.The menu is very slow, good luck figuring it out!Also expect music videos, not as dynamic and engaging as Live Aus Berlin."
5,R+ ist...Super! Ganz Gut! Nien eine besser!,"Every Rammstein fan needs to see it...EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU! Lol it's great great great!Liebe,G-B A"
5,Lisa's LAST album - not the one and only...,"I have been a Lisa Hartman fan since her first album ""Hold On"" for the now defunct Don Kirschner Records and the series ""Tabitha"" in which she starred with Robert Urich.I love all of her albums, ""Hold On"" being my favorite.That said, this is a GREAT album and I also hope she decides to record another album one day - quit hogging the spotlight, Clint!! You know she has singing talent!!!"
3,"Strong start, Slow finish","This is a novel about a boy in South Africa who runs away from home because of his abusive stepfather. In the beginning it is about the boy's life on the streets and his adventures with the Malude. This part of the book is interesting and exciting, but the second half of the book gets boring, because he starts to live with a family, just like a regular kid. Overall I thought that this book was not that interesting, and I would not recomend it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"With a title like ""Everyday Low Carb Cookery,"" I was expecting recipes that I could make with a minimum of hassle that would please my entire family of normal people. The recipes were far too gourmet (something I also dislike about the Atkins recipes), and few (I think I noted three) were quick enough to make on a typical work night. The author might eat like this every day, but he probably doesn't have to commute after work and feed anyone under the age of 18. I am returning this book."
5,"Great cookbook, even for non-low carbers","This is an amazing cookbook. I have made at least one recipe from it each day since getting it a month ago. The recipes feature an incredible variety of flavors and cuisines, yet doable from ingredients in your pantry and freezer; these on-hand ingredients are transformed through the cooking techniques in the recipes to yield very complex flavors. My non-low carb family has enjoyed the recipes as well. There is also great personality in the intros to the recipes which makes the book entertaining to read. Last but not least, a frequent feature of the recipes (although optional in many cases) is hot pepper flavorings. The pepper buzz is a welcome alternative to the sugar high that we recovering carb addicts sometimes still miss."
4,Great flick!,Enjoyed this movie tremendously. It kinda stuck with the book's storyline. Walter Mosley is an excellent author.
1,Real World Las Vegas,BAD!... somebody wanted to get rich quick pretty bad!... if you like be taunted by sexual inuendos...this is a great dvd for this... but all fluff... no bite!
4,Fantastic Vintage Cookbook,Looking for classic cookie recipes found in grandma's index card boxes all over the nation? Look no further. This is my one stop book for all my Christmas cookies and candies. Not only does it tons of simple classic cookies but it has techniques and definitions I find indepensible. The photos other than the cover and some of the cookie platters are mostly black and white.
3,Great Album,"Of course I got this album because of the 1st track. I love the 80's sound and the song ""Jane's getting serious"", fits in with that danceballad genre. The entire album has 'it' with his signature voice, the sound stays pretty much the same, but I wish he had done more."
4,Outstanding Pick!,"Debbie Gibson's Out of the Blue is an outstanding pick next to Electric Youth. Though I would rate this four stars because four songs I love most on this album. Out of the Blue is a classic song, an outpour of realising what love is without the lover. Foolish beat of my heart is my fav song that shells out emotions through words. Red Hot has the talented voice of Debbie that sways you on high feeling. Shake your love scored to charts and this one's a catchy cheery number. The vocals match so superbly with the Synthesizer pieces and Debbie Gibson lyrics are almost on lips. However, I feel Electric Youth, her second album was just terrific making Out of the Blue slip down to four stars. Neways, enjoy! Its cool."
5,"Clannad, Great Show and Gift","This show was and still is awesome, not to the review,the pack came in a case as shown, there were no problems with itother than the things noted in the other reviews,the thing of the disks being stackedother than that it came perfect and not a problem, no scratches or anything, i highly recommend this to anyone who has the moneyEven if your not a fan of Clannad"
5,"The most touching, amazing story anyone could ever watch","Let me just say, I can watch this anime twenty times over and never get tired of it. Every character is full of personalities - each unique. You're bound to fall in love with at least one character, whether it be Fuko - a childish, starfish loving girl, Nagisa, one of the main characters who develops into a lovely girl later on in the story, Youhei - a rebellious hilarious guy or any of the others. This anime is full of emotions - the original 'Clannad' has many hilarious scenes that will literally make you laugh out loud, and Clannad: After Story shares that along with drama along the way. Do not judge this anime simply because it's an anime - for even if it wasn't, the story is still wonderful and cannot be compared. It shows that miracles are possible and wishes do come true if you hold on and keep working at it. Live life to it's fullest, because every day could be your last.Seriously, I highly recommend this. You won't be disappointed."
5,metalhead,"this is the best overkill album every track is just too great. Such great screaming of the vocalist Blitz"" and shredding guitars from Ellsworth"". But there is only one problem, why is it that taking over is the hardest release to get by overkill, I mean it's so great and has high demand why won't the group and record label just re- release it again. I'm sure many others are waiting for that chance again."
5,a true lost thrash classic!,"this cd has the pure thrash fury of the days of old with classics of powersurge,wrecking crew,deny the cross,overkill 2 and electroviolence.this cd was still a building point in their career but they come with a second cd that build on the first cds prowes and surpasses it and shows you some new tricks.in the years to come they will stand tall with the thrash giants but never get to the top of the heap but they will make a serious attempt to prove they have the chops with years of decay and horrorscope and wfo!this cd deserves a spot in the books of thrash metals top ten bands!"
3,---,I want to buy this book but I live in Greece and it's very difficult to do that.I really want a help...I think I'm 'alone'...
5,These are the best Superman Comics ever!,These are some of the best comics ever written or drawn. It is obvious why Superman is so great with a start like this. Superman fights actual problems in society--he is a social reformer. He tries to help the good at any cost. The drawings are just fun. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys good stories and mighty heroes that fight real menaces.
1,You only receive the pleated filter!,"As some other reviewers have noted, this only came with the pleated filter, not the plastic pre-filter that is part of the set. I'd read their reviews, however, thought, Ha! I'm sure I'll get the set...having faith in the photograph and the description. Nope. Just one little pleated filter for $7.45. Save your $$ and get a different filter set."
1,Picture misrepresented purchase,"The picture misrepresented the product. There was only one filter, not two, as advertized in a number of pictures.Company should make good on their offer or change it."
1,Not as advertised & not fulfilled by company stated,"This was a miss-representation of product. The two piece set with both filter and housing was shown, but only the paper filter was received. Last month I purchased the same filter from AmazonPrime. It was sold by Crucial Vacuum and was both filter and filter housing in a Black & Decker box. When I purchased this one, I made sure I found the one that was sold by Crucial Vacuum and fulfilled by AmazonPrime thinking it was the exact same purchase as the last one. I was very disappointed when it arrived and was the paper filter only in a ziploc bag with barcode sticker on the bag. The seller was T & T Enterprises, LLC.- TOTALLY not as advertised and shown/described. Will never purchase one again from Amazon since I don't know what I'm purchasing until it arrives. When I try to review T & T, it comes up as Crucial Vacuum, Inc. Don't know what's going on."
3,black and decker vf20 filters,Ordered two of the filter sets and received both. One was in a black and decker box and was imprinted with the B&D name on the outer filter. The other came in a bag and did not have the B&D logo on the outer filter and the paper filter is made from a different type of paper than the 'real' B&D filter. The 'real' one fit the vacuum nicely. the knock-off in the bag does not lock onto the vacuum properly. Not worth the trouble to return.. will make the odd one work.
2,Product is really Honeywell and not Black and Decker Filter,"Filters were sold as a Filter Set. Item received was replacement paper filter--only. (Filter Set from Black and Decker VF20 is two parts: a plastic filter and a paper filter.) Photo shown in product listing isn't what you receive. You receive after market product produced by Honeywell. Honeywell's paper filter will fit the the DustBuster, but it has less paper surface area. (It's not going to allow as much air to flow through it, when using the DustBuster.) I'm very disappointed. If I wanted the Honeywell filter product for my DustBuster, I could've bought it for less from a different vendor."
5,Nice replacement filter,I buy these for my wife who uses the cordless vacuum everyday. I buy them buy the case so she doesn't run out.
1,Definitely Need More Info,"Big Beatles collectors out there like us think Not a Second Time is more than the Capitol issue of this album on CD. What is it? What are the tracks and are they alternate versions, and if they are reissues of the superb Capital mixes, are they releasing them all?"
4,Thorough history,"I purchased this book before my recent trip to Poland in order to understand the history of the country before arriving. I am not much of a history fan, but this interested me. The book was thorough about not only the history but also the culture, literature, etc., of what we now call Poland. The book was a little dry for me, but that's how I view most history books. The book does not go into every detail, but it will give you a good general idea of what happened when and to whom."
3,The View from Nashville,"I enjoyed most of the interviews in this book, but didn't agree on some of the people he thought were just fine.. Popular opinion was not with Him on these people..To Me, He seems so pompous, even on His shows.."
3,"good stuff, but....",....no doubt tried'n'true-knock-down-drag-out-get-the-crash-cart stuff....any real Ozzy will love the laid-back delivery....and the groundwork portion is great...but methinx a combo of Sperry/Roufus dvdz be 'better'....peas'n'wuv erflingz
1,Horrible product,This batteries lasted about 2 cycles before they would no longer hold a charge. What a colossal waste of money! I would have been better off buying disposables. Save your money.
3,An eye for an eye - vigilante dad,"Quite an impressive cast on this movie - Kevin Bacon, Kelly Preston, John Goodman in a dynamite role.There were some gut wrenching scenes in this movie. What would you do, as a loving parent, if your beloved son was slaughtered in front of your eyes? And you didn't think the murderer would pay a fair price for taking his life? (But what would be a fair price? I'm quite sure a parent would never think any punishment was harsh enough.)This movie explores, or at least attempts to explore, some of the deeper ramifications of this killing and the events that follow. But most of any productive message gets lost in the gorefest.I thought the first half of the movie was done pretty well but once the retribution started, it was over the top. It was as if the Director couldn't decide whether he wanted to make a ""Movie with a message"" or a slasher film.It wasn't terrible. There were good moments. But I wish I had rented this one rather than buying it."
3,Good at first then........,"First off what is John Goodman doing in this movie? I watched this movie & liked the facted that it acted real. (Hold on) The first half of the movie I liked, then the rest of the movie, WOW. What a joke. The supporting actors were terrible.(Kevin Bacon was by far the best in the movie.) It had this 'so called gang' to me it was a joke, HAHA. In 'The Gang' it had a Black guy, some Mexicans (maybe they were if so they did not fit the look.) & some SKIN HEADS. WHAT?, are you kidding me? That was poor of hollywood to think thats what a gang is like. The ending of this movie was just enough to say 'Why did I watch this?'"
1,NOT FOR KIDS,"Mickey Mouse has capitalized on the ""When Animals Attack"" phenomenon with this book. The book tells of graphic dismemberments on the ""Matterhorn"", drownings en route to ""Tom Sawyers Island"", and raping and pillage on ""Pirates of the Carribbean"". This book should have been titled, ""When Mickey Attacks"". Terrible"
2,Caution: You may lose a bit of the magic....,"This is a very well written book about the inner workings and secrets of Disneyland. For me though, being a huge Disneyland fan, I lost a little bit of the Disney magic. I do not need to know that some of the past cast members called it ""Dismal Land"" and hated their jobs; or that there has been a murder at DL; or some of the other disturbing events. I walked away after reading this book with a bit of sadness; the magic that I feel when I walk through those gates will be forever tarnished, and I deeply regret reading this book."
5,country wisdom and know how,a must have book. referred to friends who ended up purchasing this book. lots of info on working the land and utilizing what you have.
4,Country Wisdon & Know How,"Great book, has a lot of information for gardening and other applications. Recommend the book for anyone who wants to do things out doors and cooking."
4,Very insightful,"Having dealt with depression for six years, I found this book to be a very useful eye-opener; I don't think anything I've read has helped me heal as much as Dr. Gregg's. It will enable you to find and deal with the root causes of many of the issues that worry or upset you and to raise your self-esteem. There were a couple ideas in the book I didn't entirely agree with, but then it's also a question of interpretation. Highly recommend."
3,A little to convienient--plot and ending...,"I have read all of Ms. Spencer's books...so much that I keep looking at titles hoping beyond hope that I've missed one or a new one has come out...this one is not one of her best (even though I've read it twice.) If only things worked that way in real life...ahhh...well, that's why its a romance novel. The solution to this plot line is a little too pat, even for the time period that its set in."
5,Another good story,"This is a hauntingly good story. Kinda of dark but it works, it's real. Be careful of what you ask for... I really enjoy this author."
4,"Except for the predictable ending, this story is almost perfect!","This is a very moving story about a woman,who is loved by two men and in turn she loves them both but the passion she can share with one, she can't with other. Sadly it is her husband she can't share her passion with. I can identify with her feelings because she not the first woman married to a man she can't feel carnal desire for. Not only now after seven years of marriage but she never had from the beginning of her marriage.But the man who can give her what her husband could not is her own brother in law, that's a twist and complication too good to read about. surely Lavyrle spencer does justice to the story to make it believable. If only the ending had a been a bit different. It was too Easy. I mean their situation is so complicated. This ending doesn't do it justice....But still a very enjoyable romance from my favourite romance writer."
4,Found By mistake.. But Loved it,"I was actually looking for [something else] but somehow google chose to send me to this site, and this book. On a whim, intrigued, I began to look into the book for more detail. I made the decision, purchased the book, and was pleasently impressed. It's amazing how often the things you look for are not what you find, but what you find is better than what you were looking for!"
5,Really good read,"I found this at a used bookstore for a dollar and some change. I quickly thumbed through it and purchased it fully expecting to be dissapointed. But I was wrong, and enjoyed it vey much. In fact, I didn't realize the author was the famous Rocket Boy until I saw the movie October Sky on a cable channel while on a business trip. The narrative in this book really made me wonder how Admiral King managed to stay CNO. Amazing."
4,Research Material Torpedo Junction of 1942,Order received as advertised. In a timely manner as stated in offer. Will do business in furture if offer meets my needs.
5,Spongebob,We received our DVD really fast...got it the next day!!! DVD was in the condition the seller described. I would recommend this seller.
4,Good product,"I purchased this video, thought I was getting something else. My children liked this video. It had a lot of the shows they had seen and liked before."
5,another great collection of spongebob,"Like all the other SpongeBob dvds, Tales from the Deep is an enjoyeable dvd. There are a couple extras, but it is loaded with episodes that contain SpongeBob's brand of humor. It has the first episode with Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy as well as Sandy's introduction. And my favorite, ""Valentine's Day"" where Patrick is tricked into thinking SpongeBob didn't get him a present (and if Patrick's not happy...no one is happy). I thought the only weak episode was the double length House Party. But even it was pretty good."
3,"Good fit, comfortable, not the best value","For the price I expected a little more, but they are still more than acceptable."
4,Almost perfect,"I really love the Little People collection. Once I got the first set for my daughter who will be 2, I realized what a fun & creative toy it was. So I continued and will continue to purchase more sets. The only thing I didn't like about the castle, which I think is beautiful, was the attachment on the top. I don't know if its just me but I found it a bit difficult to attach. And I noticed that the gate doesn't always open when you press whatever it is you're supposed to press. But again, I love it. I think I just don't know how to put things together. :D"
1,Debunker Alert! Stay Away!,"The problem with Joe Nickell's books are that he assumes that most UFO and paranormal cases are not real. If a self -acclaimed investigator writes about the paranormal, should'nt they have an open mind instead of already judging the case before the investigation takes place? A good investigator presents both sides of the equation, Nickell usually does not.Mr. Nickell, do yourself a favor and warn everyone that you don't believe in much of anything before you label yourself an investigator of the paranormal."
3,Doesn't lather,My one and only complaint with this cleanser is that is does not foam into a lather. In a way it's kind of like washing your face with a thick lotion. I was disappointed because the regular oily skin cleanser from pca was fab and foamed right up so i'd only need a drop. Not so much the case with this stuff. I much prefer the other cleanser and would recommend that one. Or the blemish control bar i LOVE that stuff!
2,it wasn't advertised as 100%,"so I can't complain that the disc had some damage due to frequent use- it was from a HS library.Normally, I'd return it, but it was mostly ok, and let's face it- I'm not likely to view it again for a long time."
3,Still Waiting For The WIDESCREEN Version!,"Some ""special edition"" this is - NOT! Even a bare-bones SE is in widescreen and has director's audio commentary - this thing only has the audcom. The earlier version was a piece of junk pan-and-scan, and so now is this one. Still waiting for the widescreen, guys. Waiting..............z-z-z-z-z........."
2,Waste of time! I want my money back!!,"Okay, so kick me for giving this movie 2 stars. The first star was for being (excuse me) ballsy enough to do a stand-up routine based on his own indiscretions, embarassing moments, and general muck-ups, instead of as he said, ""waiting for the E! True Hollywood Story to tell it."" Fair enough, but I am thinking that the E! Story might have been more entertaining and less buffoonery. All that aside, this movie was a waste of an afternoon that I spent. There were very few parts that were funny/amusing. The only heartfelt message that came across was: ""No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life."" Well, damn, Martin. Maybe you oughta give comedy a rest and try philosophy."
3,Gift purchase,I bought this from my daughter's wish list. It arrived timely and in condition stated. She has not complained about it so I'm sure she is enjoying it.
1,dissappointing,"this is one of the first stand up comedy dvd's i have bought (along with kings of comedy) and i have to say i was dissappointed. he's really not too funny with his racial jokes, chris rock and dave chapelle are much better in this area. also its annoying to hear more bin laden/911 jokes... they're just not that funny. i really wish i could return this dvd, i couldnt even watch it all the way through the whole thing"
1,Worst book ever,I purchased this book to work on my 1990 4runner and it is worthless. The diagrams show very little if any detail. DO NOT PURCHASE.
2,Mediocre service manual at best.,I bought this book for maintenance on a 1994 Toyota Pick-up. Not very helpful because the information and drawings I needed were inaccurate. I bought a Haynes Manual and found it to be much more reliable.
5,A Masterpiece from a Musical Genius,"This is truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I just cannot fault it. Anita's voice-vocal range, sound, notation, emotional capture is 10/10. The lyrics-unforgetable, intense is 10/10. The music-sound, instrumentation, chords, rhythmn section is 10/10. The songs are all beautiful and flow perfectly well. The album is the perfect package. This album has stood the test of time and will continue to be played in 100 years time.Till this day I continue to hear these songs being played in shopping malls and train stations in Brazil, Chile, Thailand, Hong Kong, USA, UK, France, Holland, Germany, South Africa, Nigeria, Italy, Australia to name a few.No wonder Anita Baker is adored by so many other musicians including Pavarotti, Mary J Blige, Faith Evans, Celine Dionne, Tyrese, Snoop Dog and many others. Mary J Blige once said this album saved her life. I say, Im not surprised because it made mine."
5,ANITA'S BEST,For anybody who knows me from back in the days to the present knows that I LOVE ANITA BAKER. She set the standard for R&B/Jazz music. This is her best work only because her songs on this lp relax you so much you can go to sleep on them. And then on top of that dance so smooth to it. I can remember when I was having a bad day I'd come home put this tape in and just relax. This lp has that effect on you. So for those who don't know about this cd need to buy or borrow it because this is R&B music at its best.
5,Great CD!,"I've never been comppelled to write a reveiw for a CD before, but after hereing Sunny Waters's CD I just had to write a reveiw. Like a breathe of fresh air the lyrics and the music are so sootheing to listen too. Sunny has a unigue gift of song writing, and each song is like a piece of peotry that creates beutiful pictures in you're mind. I listen to the cd almost everyday and cant wait for a second cd from Sunny Waters. Karen"
3,Too much dust,"Held all right, but produces a ton of dust flakes when I touched my hair. I stopped using it, but my wife likes it."
5,Natural Hair Spray Works,This is such a great product because it is natural and it really works well with just a small amount of spray needed each time you use it. It lasts all day!! I intend to use no other hair spray ever again!!
2,I wanted to like this but didn't,"I really wanted to like this product since I'm moving to more natural personal care items. Unfortunately, this product didn't spray evenly and didn't hold my short fine hair for more than a couple of hours. I've ordered my old stand-by Eurphora Firm Mist Finishing Spray which works beautifully for me. My search for a natural hairspray continues."
5,Hypnotic,"""Gertrude of Stony Island Avenue"" is a hypnotic tale in which the boundary between the strange and the normal seems forever blurred. I was captivated by Purdy's highly distinctive style, which feels authentically ""old-timey"" yet also perpetually ""off-balance."" Carrie's search for her daughter constitutes one of the strangest yet ultimately moving quests for selfhood I have ever read."
3,Entertaining but just not Grissom,"I have enjoyed all of Grisom's previous novels, but think that he should stick to Lawering. While this is an easy read, it has been done to death. He didn't miss many sterotypes or standard plots of the genre. I was reminded of ""The Education of Little Tree"", which was far better. I'll admit that it did hold my interest,though."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING :((,"I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS WRITING! I HAVE LOVED ALL OF HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE LACKS ""him"". I KEPT LOOKING FOR THE PLOT, NEVER TO BE FOUND. JUST A BUNCH OF RAMBLING ON, NO STRUCTURE. I BOUGHT THE BOOK ON CASSETTE, UNABRIDGED, BUT FEEL I WASTED MY MONEY!!!!!!! HERE'S HOPING FOR MUCH BETTER IN THE FUTURE! SINCERELY, FRANCES WILLIAMS"
4,"Expectations, Expectations","Reading through some of the other reviews of this book, I am struck by the extremes. Some give it one star, others give it four or five. I believe this is due to the expectations the reader brings with him to this book. If you expect another Grisham lawyer mystery/drama with tight action sequences you will be disappointed. If you expect a good story that is well-written you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is that the ending is abrupt and somewhat unsatisfying, although Grisham may have done this on purpose to parallel how Luke's world changed at the end."
3,To Kill a Tom Sawyer,Good but not great. Would be a super book to give to a spoiled teenager. I'm amazed at the vignettes that resemble To Kill a Mockingbird and Tom Sawyer. Quite accurate portrayal of poor rural southern life - in this era of technology it is hard to believe that just a few years ago many did just live hand to mouth. A nice book though I would cut out the house painting business.
1,Hours of My Life I Can Never Reclaim,"If I had a choice, it wouldn't have received even a 1 star rating. What has happed to John Grisham? I've enjoyed his law-based quick-read-mind-candy that he's cranked out in the past, but this book was awful. Filled with unendingly dull reiterations of cotton growing/farming/picking I wanted to blind myself. His sick portrayal of a 7 year old boy who expresses realistic 14 year old tendencies continually piqued my anger throughout the book. I drudged through to the highly predictable ending that only proved to me that Grisham should stick to what he knows. I've decided to pass on the future recommendations of friends who told me this was a must read. So happy I didn't buy it."
4,Different,"Not his norm, however a very clever and witty story line. It will keep you turning the pages just to find out what will happen!!"
4,A different Grishams,This story has a very different style compared to most of Grisham's books. Its a slow moving but interesting read.
3,Nice and easy does it...,"One has to ignore the fact that John Grisham penned this novel. It is, as most relate, not the usual for him.No mystery, it is a sweet book, written thru the eyes of an Arkansas farm boy of seven.It was an easy read, and had character, It told the story of the Chandler family, cotton growers, the harvesting and economic hardships often involved.Migrant farm workers played heavily in the novel and what they brought to the Chandler family in a season of picking.Nice and easy does it..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This was a horrible book. While I think the rest of his books are follow a specific formula and are kind of repetitive in some ways I was begging for that feature in this book. The book is slow, and pointless. If you must read this book then please check it out from the library and save your money. I have enjoyed most of Mr. Grishman's book but this one was a big dissapointment. He needs to stick with what works, books about legal issues, regular fiction is not his game."
1,A Sad Disappointment,"After The Street Lawyer, I decided not to invest in further John Grisham novels. When I saw the reviews for Painted House, I changed my mind. I wish I hadn't !! There was almost no plot, very little character 'building' and, as a consequence, I found the story flat and lifeless. Sorry, Mister Grisham, but this really wasn't for me."
2,Love Grisham but really hated this one!,"I have read all Grisham's books, most within a day or two. I still read this one fast, but unfortunately I read it fast because after a hundred pages or so I began to skim read. I do not like to skim and don't even remember the last time I have resorted to doing so because I normally love to absorb the details of a well-written book. Despite Grisham's attempt to depart from his typical style and bring us a nice story about a poor southern boy to life, I was bored to tears and raced through to see if it was ever going to get any better. I do like non-suspense literature but this is not Grisham's forte. Without lawyers, he is out of his element. John, please return to the stuff we love!"
3,"Not his best, but I liked it anyway!","I read this book a few days ago and felt that I should voice my humble opinion on its qualities. The storyline was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages as the tale unfolded. The conflicts between the main character and the world around him are both engrossing and touching at the same time.I felt like I was there in the old south a times. I could smell the magnolias and hear the ice crackling in the glasses of lemonade on the porch.I recommened this book to all citizens who love tales of the land below the mason-dixon line... and, if you are a baby boomer it will certainly stirr up old memories of times past."
1,Grisham Disappoints Again,"I've always waited impatiently for John Grisham's next book, buying the hardback instead of waiting for the paperback release. I was very, very disappointed with this book. I found it hard reading because there basically is nothing to grab your attention, nothing to keep you avidly reading well into the wee hours of the morning. It took me 2 months to finish this book, and the only reason I finished it at all is because my husband bought the hardback and I felt guilty about not reading to the end.Perhaps John Grisham feels he's made enough money that he doesn't have to produce gripping stories anymore - or perhaps he was contracted to write so many books and is struggling storywise to fulfill his obligation.The storyline to this book was so dismal, so slow and so uninteresting - a real disappointment. This reader will wait for the paperback editions of any future Grisham books, but only after reading reviews.John, what happened?"
1,WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER.,"""A Painted House"" is definitely not a page turner and not John Grisham at his finest. I think he made a mistake when he deviated from what he does best, and that is writing stories about law and order. ""A Painted House"" is the kind of book that is easy to put down and not pick up again for days. I found it rather slow and at times downright boring. People slave in the cotton fields day after day and fall into bed completely exhausted every night, only to get up again the next morning to repeat the whole process over again. This is not to say that there weren't some interesting pages in the book about migrant workers and mountain people who came to pick cotton so that they could make ends meet and put food on their table. However, in the final analysis, I thought this tedious tale would never end."
1,Missing Out on a Painted House,"I have not been able to get into this book. Maybe because it was the first different book he wrote. I did love Skipping Christmas, though it was great."
2,A Painted House,"Found this book extremely boring. Nothing really happens until you are two thirds through it. The last third of the book seems to be setting you up for the sequel. If this were someone else's novel, rather than John Grisham's, can't believe publishers would have ever considered it. Maybe they read the sequel."
3,3 1/2 stars - an enjoyable departure,"With A Painted House, Grisham departs from his traditional lawyer-based genre. Having always enjoyed Grisham's novels, especially his early works, I was not sure what to expect from this effort. I found it to be a pleasant and enjoyable novel. A Painted House describes life on a cotton farm in (extremely) rural Arkansas during the 1950s. As the story unfolds, harvest time is getting underway. The trials and tribulations of life on the cotton farm almost 50 years ago are presented with stark clarity through the eyes of a 7 year old, Luke Chandler. Luke's hopes and aspirations are brought fourth and played against the hardship and uncertainty facing the Chandler family year after year as cotton farmers. Grisham provides a colorful, wide-ranging set of characters that add depth and intrigue throughout the story. Although not a page turner with a gripping climax destined to keep one late into the night reading, all-in-all A Painted House is definitely worth a look."
2,A time for pseudonyms,"When I buy a book, I read the blurb and reviews and try to figure out if it's going to be a good read. When I buy an Author, I grab and go. John Grisham is no longer a grab and go. I am very disappointed by the lastest offering by Mr. Grisham. It's a bad as opening a new Clancy and finding poetry. It's like I've been robbed of time and money. If Grisham wants to experiment with style and genre, I think he should use a pen name. It's a cotton picking shame he had to flood the market with a dirt poor, down and out, out-of-character work. Now I've got to start vetting his work before buying."
1,Thumbs Down,"I like metaphores as much as the next guy, er, or girl. But this has got to be one of the most boring, uninspired book I've ever read with a title that is as shallow as the depth of this story. I understand that Grisham wanted to break out of the crusty-Lawyer vs the Big Bad Businesses kind of plot-letting, but this was more than I could stand. I knew going into it that it was much more laid back, no lawyers, no courtrooms...but what I was not expecting was a narrative of a 7 year-old boy (who's too young to think about sex) living on a farm with his reletives, each of which you never really get to know very well. Crops, rain, more crops, more rain, a one-paragraph murder, an illegitimate baby. No thanks. I think I'd rather watch the ""paint dry"" than to read ""A Painted House""."
4,"He gets ""southern"" right","I love to read about the south from a real southerner. John Grisham gets every nuance right. The tale is so true to real life that I wasn't able to ""escape"" as I did reading his previous work. I missed the lawyers, but this was a beautifully written book, and well worth the investment of time."
3,This is the oddest book...,"I cannot understand why I enjoyed A Painted House.As others have said, there are no resolutions to many of the conflicts in this book. I was disappointed at the end when we didn't find out about the brother, the baby, or the family they took in. I also kept waiting to find out what significance the painting of the house had but never did. I feel we should all be shipped a sequel at no cost to the readers.All that being said, I still enjoyed reading it thoroughly. It was sort of like taking a little vacation I guess. It had a Dandelion Wine (Ray Bradbury) and To Kill A Mockingbird feel to it. I can't explain why I liked it. I will probably read it again sometime in the near future when I need to relax a little."
1,Would McDonald's ever sell pizzas and stop selling BigMacs?,"or Coca-Cola sell wine and stop selling Coke.... John, where is my February law novel? I don't really care if you want to have a go at writing something different, but I NEED MY FEBRUARY LAW NOVEL. I can't wait another 12 months! By the way, you could have warned us that the Painted House is totally boring for readers who did not grow up in Arkansas, and don't follow baseball."
1,Grisham! Stick with what you do best!,"A very sad story about sharecroppers. Reminded me of an Oprah Book. If I hadn't purchased the book myself, I would have sworn it was absolutely not a Grisham."
2,Ending? What ending?,"This started out very interesting reading. The world from a 7 year old's view was natural and refreshing and the could reader empathize with fantasies of the Cardinals, the hot sun while picking cotton and his fears and curiosity about the hill and Mexican people. Tension builds between groups, the little boy is burdened with secrets no adult could reasonably cope with, from violence to outright murder, yet in the end, there is no resolution for the reader to ""end"" the story. Just a resolution that grandpa and boy will carry a secret to their graves....oh, come on! It seemed the author just had to foist on some simplistic conclusions at the end that Mexican and hill people really are basically nice people, all in the same boat to struggle, and work and survive Arkansas in the 1950's.Very disappointing. I would not recommend this to others."
1,A Painted House,"Totally surprised by this book. All I could do to read it, and it normally takes 1-2 days to read a John Grisham book. Didn't like it at all and wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not Worth the Wait,"There are only a few authors that I look forward with anticipation for their new books. John Grisham is one. Although I certainly could have waited a lot longer for this one. This book seems to encompass the same day throughout. It plots along and in some places, drags along. There is never edge-of-your-seat action. It gets to the point of ""who cares"". I had to stop 3 times and read another book in between. My advice is to wait for the paperback and then try it. John Grisham should go back to what he does best, legal thrillers."
4,Painted House,"I loved this book! My family had very similar experiences. My grandfather was a sharecropper until later in life, when he could finally afford his own land. My dad was the first in the family to leave to go north. He worked in a Formfit factory, making bras, etc. He was the sewing achine mechanic and went to barber college at night.We lived in a trailer court, As my dad and first mom said, ""At least we are out of the fields!""Soon my uncle Bill and Uncle Roscoe came. Uncle Bill and Uncle Roscoe worked construction and helped build O'Hare airport. We would go there when I was small. This book is so accurate that my dad and second mom will not read it--as they say, ""We lived it!""The author really caught the feel and tone of Marked Tree. I really enjoyed the book. It was formulaic, but is very true to the time. I understood the pain of the narrator in getting the paint for the house. We did litte tiny things like that when we visited Grandma. Again, very true to form!"
2,Not your typical Grisham,"this is not what you expect to get with a Grisham novel. there is no plot, at all. it is an interesting book if you are interested in life in the rural south in the 1950's. I grew up in the rural south around this era and was familiar with much of what was discussed in the book. it was nostalgic and often humorus but not what i look for from Mr. Grisham."
5,"Hero, Stan Musial","Luke was seven years old, living on a cotton farm in the Arkansas delta with his father and mother, grandfather and grandmother. He knew that when he grew up he would be a baseball player, and like his idol, Stan Musial would play for the Cardinals. In the meantime lots is happening in the town and on the farm where they lived in a unpainted oak farmhouse. Taking place in the early '50's we learn of the itinerant workers who camp on the farm and pick the cotton for $1.60 a hundred pounds, the hill people and the Mexicans with their own prejudices. Into this bucolic setting comes murder, a baby without a father and secrets Luke can't find a way to share. Then someone starts painting the house white."
3,nice read,"i think this book was a nice read, nothing to write home about but luke was sweet and the family was nice, the book had no endings: for example the guy in the war where did he end up or the baby, or the ""runaways"" or the hill people when they got home or the floods or how the bus ride ends there does need to be a sequel and i admit i would love to read it"
4,Excellent Work,"In his first departure from the legal thrillers, Grisham strikes off in an interesting new direction. It is an interesting work reminescient of Faulkner and Steinbeck yet laced with his own definitive humor. Grisham comes across as a little unpolished for this classical style of writing but it is obviously a work of the heart which he gave considerably more effort than his past several works. Read it with an open mind and no pre-conceptions about the limits of his literary talent and you will be very pleanantly surprised."
4,Author successfully changes genres,I enjoyed this coming of age story of Luke set in rural Arkansas. It was a welcomed departure from the lawyer books and took me back to the fifties which appeals to all aging baby boomers born prior to 1950. It reminded me in scenery of Cold Mountain and also Baldacci's The Wishing Well which was another coming of age story written from the voice of a 12-year old girl. I would suggest that Grisham is capable of writing in multiple genres and he can continue with Luke and follow him into adulthood as a first-year law student. Many possibilities abound in this semi-autobiographical tale of young Luke. A good read. Keep it up John.
3,Just OK,"I loved the character and thought they were very well developed. My complaint is that nothing much happened, and the ending was very disappointing. I wanted to know how things turned out for the characters but everything was left in the air. When I finished I felt like the last chapter must have been left out of my book."
3,"No Lawyers, no legal wrangling, no fun!!","I read this one while on vacation in the Bahamas. I found it to be a 'novel' of less interest than his past efforts. I knew that it would be different, but I wasn't impressed with it as much as his past efforts. I don't read much, but when I do, I like the suspense that he offfered up in the past."
5,A nice change,"When I bought this book I wasn't expecting a Law Thriller, so my expectations for the book were not all that high.I began reading the book and thought to myself, I cannot believe I just bought this book. Boy was I mistaken.Grisham does a wonderful job with this book. The buildup of all the characters was wonderful and the story behind the story, marvelous...It was a pleasant change from Grisham with this book.. A+"
3,Ending seemed too abrupt and incomplete.,"I was into the book and enjoying the way the story was being told. Unfortunately, the loose ends never got ""tied up."" I thought the author could have given us some insight as to what happened to several of the main characters. Is a sequel planned??"
2,Boring,"Although the story is very well written--good character development, etc. it was BORING and predictable. So much so that with only 1/4 of the book left I found myself jumping ahead 50 pages or so at a time and not missing anything."
1,Bored me to tears....,"I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton."
2,Well-written but SLOW,"I am a big John Grisham fan and this was my first experience with a non-lawyer novel of his. I have to say I prefer the suspense books a lot more. While Grisham certainly has an extraordinary gift for painting a detailed picture with his words, in this case that of a little-known slice of the American past, the picture turns out to be not all that interesting to look at. Perhaps it's the fact that it's told through the eyes of a 7-year-old, perhaps it's the fact that life as an Arkansas cotton farmer in 1950 was incredibly dull, but this book was much more put-downable than other Grisham books. Even the book itself seems to conclude that this is a rather miserable way to live out one's life, and that those who could escape it, did. If you're looking for something slow and meandering, read it, but don't be expecting ""The Firm""."
1,300 pages into this and nothing interesting yet,"I have a couple hundred pages to go here and nothing interesting has happened. Ok, someone got killed but you know who did it and even if you didnt, you would care either way because the guy getting killed is some beatnik that wasnt even a part of the story. This is so ho-hum and mediocre I cant believe it. It reads like it was meant for ages 5 and under. Farm life must be pretty boring right? Well, heres a story about everyday farm life and nothing more. The result? Boring. The characters are uninteresting and the writing style has no coloration whatsoever. Bland, bland, bland. If something happens during the remaining pages, assuming I get that far, I will eat my words and update this. This is the last Grisham book I'll ever read. I quit reading his works about 4 books ago as I finally realized, the guy just cant write."
3,A Grisham disappointment!,"As an avid and longtime Grisham fan, I eargerly picked up A Painted House for an enjoyable read.Unfortunately, I found the pacing of this novel tedious and strained. Where I usually found myself unable to put down one of Grisham's novels, I found myself struggling to get through this one.I'm not one of those readers who thinks Grisham should ""stick to what he knows best"" and write only law-based thrillers. However, I found this foray into general fiction to be a disappointment. I hope he tries again - but I hope he remembers to incorporate some of the exciting pace that his other novels have kept up."
4,My First John Grisham Book.,"I truly enjoyed ""A Painted House""; Grisham did a brillant job painting a picture for me of the life of a poor cotton farmer family in 1952 Arkansas. At times I could feel the thorns of the cotton plants as they picked the cotton and the warmth of their caring way of life.Even though at times I thought Luke had the insights of an older person than a seven year old boy, I enjoyed the clever way Grisham got me feeling that I was part of the Chandler Family. I found myself laughing out loud at the funny way Luke looked at life.This will certainly be the first of many books that I will read by John Grisham."
2,BROKEN in 6 months,"I got this brand new. within 6 months it started with the blacklines,and then bleeding colours,then BOOM..it went dark.lucky for me,I got the $ 129.00 in home 3 yr warrantyand today..I called for service."
5,This is one of the best cds that I own!,"This cd is energizing, calming , touching, poetic, inspiring, romantic... all at the same time. I never tire of listening to it and through the years it has been a wonderful musical background to unforgettable moments with friends, remarkable trips or only to relaxing moments ar home. I recomend it to anyone who loves to listen to instrumental music that can take you on imaginary journeys into the beauty of sounds and feelings. Give it a try and it will surely become one of your favorites, as it is one of mine!!"
2,"Worth a try, but don't really like it","Perhaps the degree of doming is wrong for my finger, but this really didn't work for me. Also, the adhesive disks didn't work well. Worth a try though."
2,disappointed...,"I was really excited to get this product...mother of 3, never have time to lay out in the sun...this was the perfect solution. Carefully read the directions and tried to apply it, but it came out in clumps...???...maybe I got a defective bottle...I don't know, but I had to quickly smear the globs around on my skin to keep it from looking 'patchy'. I would not purchase again."
3,Spray will clog,"I ordered 4 cans of this product over about 4 months. One can was clogged from day one and useless. The others worked but you have to clear the spray constantly. If the spray works, the product is great.It's probably a combination of the texture of the tanning material - size of the spray opening and not enough pressure in the can. Hard to recommend, based on the spray issues."
4,bushnell 20 x 50,"binocular is excellent, great vision and handling. the paddle type of adjustment could use some work. it was stiff and difficult to adjust. also buried to low in the frame, need some long fingers to use it with ease. i would have preferred the wheel instead."
2,BINOCULARS,I ORDERED THE WRONG SET OF BINOCULARS AND THESE WERE NOT WHAT I WANTED. I DID NOT USE THE GLASSSES AND RETURNED THEM IMMEDIATELY. THEREFORE I CAN NOT REALLY RATE THESE BINOCULARS.
2,"Review of similar model, Powerview 16x50","I have the Powerview 16x50 model. They are difficult to hold steady and difficult keep focused. The Powerview 20x60 model has 25% more magnification, so I assume it's 25% more difficult to hold them steady and 25% more difficult to keep them focused. The Zip focus is a handy feature. You'll need it! I find myself refocusing the 16x50's all the time. For the same price, I think a good pair of 10x50's would be easier to use and provide better image quality."
2,not what I expected,"Bushnell is normally a very well rated product. I have owned several binoculars over the decades, but this set could not be adjusted. It did not fit right over the eyes (too narrow) could not be widened enough to give clear vision. All I got was double-vision. ALSO, I suspect that this item was returned once before because there was NO paperwork in the box... no warranty, nothing!!!!! I don't know, but this might have been a defective item. Sorry, I returned them."
1,Not so great.,"I purchased these binos because they appeared to be a good deal. However, they didn't turn out to be. The binos arrived with one of the lenses bent inward significantly. I returned them to amazon with no hassle. The representative who helped me over the phone was very nice and even sent me a replacement the very next day. The replacement binos seemed fine at first but then I noticed that the lenses were slightly crooked. So when viewing an object, both eyes have different perspectives which creates a blurred view. The only way to view an object clearly is to keep one eye closed. I would return these too, but I threw away the manufacturer's packaging. I wouldn't recommend these. If I had to do it all over again, I would pay a little more for something better."
5,Very pleased,This product is exactly whats advertised. I've found good quality at an affordable price and would definately recommend these to anyone looking for the same.
1,Dissapointed,The vision tubes on the binoculars were out of alignment. This caused double images. A simple vision test before putting this pair on the market would have caught this defect. I am dissapointed that the manufacturer did not catch this defect. It did not make me want to get a replacement pair. I sent them back to Amazon for a refund. It was easy to return them to Amazon.
4,super duper binocs,"Like some of the other reviews said. Its a little shakey because they are so powerful. I took them to the PRINCE concert, and we were pretty close already. When I looked through them at PRINCE, all I saw were eyes looking back at me. lol. Will work great for what I bought them for. Spy on other fisherman and see what they are using for lures and bait. I gave it only 4 stars because you have to buy an adapter to put it on the tripod, and I feel it was misleading to the point where I thought I cwould be able to use them on the tripod out of the box. Can't wait for my next trip to vegas to people watch other rooms. lol j/k"
2,Bushnell binoculars,Did not like these binoculars because something must be wrong with the lens. I would see double images and it would not focus correctly. I have another pair that was just 10x50 and they are much better than this one with no double vision or images.
2,Confused...yoga or strength?,"This is the only Core Fusion video I didn't really care for. When I do yoga, I want to give my muscles a break and stretch and twist, but this required a lot more work than my other yoga videos. On the other hand, it wasn't challenging enough to compete with the other Core Fusion routines for strength work."
3,"a silly, fun album - but not all I had hoped for","I love Christmas music, and I do enjoy silly Christmas music. Cledus has had some great flashes of comic genius - so I decided to give this album a shot. The album was fun, but not all I had hoped for. Some of the tracks amusing, others were just kinda dull - I can't say this was Cledus' best work. The best track on this album is the cut spoofing Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" as ""My Trees on Fire"" - short of that, there wasn't much worth loading on the ipod."
2,Ridiculous,This is a poor attempt to teach children about self-control. Children learn to control impulses by either being in real situations or maybe pretend situations. They do not relate to overly anthropomorphic characterizations of animals. Let's either teach children or talk about realistic animals. Most publishers know how to do this.
4,glam rockin` @ it`s finest.....,"this is glam rock at it`s finest,from start to finish. it just has great vocals & riffs ,slick production, ROCKS"
5,"A positive perspective on Life, as it should be.","Bill Porter is one of the many everyday man or woman that are real heros going around this world. It was a great idea to present his life in a movie. He is a simbol of many men and women that do their best, despite all the adversities that they have to fight.This is the type of film that may bring many emotions, but it deserves to be seen. The key actors do a great job, by the end of the film, you feel as if you have been there. After seeing it, you will not feel sorry for Bill Porter, instead we feel good, because he is a man that did accomplish something in life, living a life similar to many of us and still setting a standard of integrity and will."
5,Door to Door,This movie is awsome. It tells a good story. The actors are great. It is funny and will bring you to tears at times. What more can I say?
5,Fantastic movie!,"This is one of my FAVORITE movies! It is based on a true story of a man who had physical limitations but he did NOT let them get in his way. No matter how many times I see this movie, I never get tired of it. In addition to the touching story, the acting is excellent. I highly recommend people see this movie. It will make you cry, but it is also inspiring."
4,amazing performance of macy,"so-so storyline, but macy's acting is amazing. sorry for him to play this role too early. if he could postpone it 10-15 years late when hollywood was obssessed with disabled characters, macy might get an oscar nomination or an oscar."
2,CD,"HOW DO I PURCHASE A COPY OF MOMENTS AND MEMORIES THE """"CANADIAN"""" VERSION I HAVE TRIED EVERYWHERE TO FIND IT AND CAN ONLY GET THE ONE FROM AUSTRALIA. ARE THEY THE SME ONE JUST DIFFERENT COVERS? PLEASE HELP"
1,Waste of money,"The suction of this cordless vacuum is so weak that it cannot pick up anything from the hardwood floor in our house! Very, very disappointed."
4,Good Value for the Money,"For a cordless under $50, this little guy performs well. I have a Rottweiler in the house that sheds constantly all year round, and it works satisfactorily to pick up the pet hair and crumbs on my hard floors. When you turn on the brush, it does a good job of cleaning up the rugs, and it's perfect for touch ups on the carpet when company's coming. My favorite part though is the hand vac, which is so convenient to have around the house; I use it more than the whole vacuum! Also, I was not disappointed with the battery life like some other reviewers; it stayed charged through my kitchen, dining room, two bathrooms, and some touch ups around the house without going dead. I gave this product four stars only because the suction could be a bit better, but as long as your expectations aren't too high (like expecting it to perform like a $800 vacuum!) I think you'll be pleased with this little helper."
3,pretty good value,"I purchased this vacuum about a year ago, and was very happy with it at first. I have all hardwood and linoleum in my house, with one area rug. I wanted a small vacuum I could use for small jobs. I used it about twice a week, sometimes using it on the floors and rug, sometimes just the rug. I have found that it has barely any suction on bare floors now, but seems to works well with the carpet brush. Also will not hold a charge for more than a couple of minutes at this point. I paid about $50 for mine, and would say I've gotten good use out of it, but wish it would have lasted longer than a year."
2,not real happy with the suction,The convenience is wonderful but the suction level is not great. I guess you really need to go with a corded vacuum to get great suction.
5,Delightful Southern family!,"I enjoyed this book SO much! The main storyline of Neely getting married was great, but the background characters are begging for stories all of their own! Tanya Michaels is just fantastic!"
1,Production made this the worst film I have ever seen,"This documentary may be full of history, but I couldn't get past the pathetic production. I enjoy documentaries and have watched dozens, but in my opinion this was the worst made film I have ever seen.I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but couldn't stand watching it. The framing was bad, the sound was bad, the edits were this close to causing a migraine and if that wasn't bad enough then I had the pleasure of seeing multiple shots of Traudl just sitting there watching her poorly done interviews on tv.Don't waste your time on this film. Spend it watching Errol Morris, Nick Broomfield, Ken Burns, and one of the many other documentary makers who know what they are doing."
3,It's ok,"The first few songs are great! However, after about 4 or 5 songs, the rest aren't that good. I don't even listen to them anymore. The soundtrack is very disappointing, almost as much as the movie was for me."
2,Disappointment,"I was so upset when I heard the soundtrack and the two songs that I wanted most weren't even on the soundtrack. ""Peace Like A River"" and ""Seasons Change"" those are like the best two songs throughout the movie.Trust your not going to find those two songs anywhere on the internet either, at least not the movie versions (the orginal versions are widely avaiable)."
4,Almost Perfect Gospel CD,"I ought to give this 5 stars just for ""You Are Good."" But as has been pointed out, the CD doesn't include ""Seasons Change"" and ""Peace Like a River,"" and instead includes music that wasn't in the movie (""Change is Gonna Come""); Mom Winan's cameo isn't in here either, and that was a good song. This CD includes a couple of versions of some music different from the version used in the movie. I really wish the CD had included all the main music from the film. Still, there's some great music here. I noticed a few people may have thought it was a little too urban. For something a bit more traditional, you could get the 1995 Grammy award winning gospel choir CD ""One Voice"" by Gladys Knight's choir, Saints Unified Voices. Me, I have both, and they're my two best gospel CDs."
4,Uplifting,"this is definitely an awesome and uplifting soundtrack! true we may have the original versions of these songs, but such a compilation of such great artists and songs could in no way display a low budget project. we should appreciate the efforts alone of such great talent to come together to make this possible. if you love gospel music, you definitely have to have this one!"
4,unfinished business,An excellent fast read...easy not to put down.A good plot...a few unexpected turns with quite a surprise ending!...and worth a read!
3,Unfinished Business,"This book is an easy read romance novel. If you're looking for a ""chick-book"", this is one very interesting story."
3,Sweet Romance,"As many here have noted, I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan, especially her ""In Death"" series. I really enjoy her suspense/thriller/romance novels, so this one was a bit different. This story is a straight romance with the family dynamic of coming home, and first loves. I, for the most part enjoyed it, but it did have it's predictable moments. If you enjoy romance novels, this one is a sweet and I would recommend it. However, if you're expecting some fast paced excitement or intrigue as you'll find in some of her other series, this one is not for you."
3,unfinished business,it was and ok book not up to nora roberts standed. and easy pick up put down. Im usually nose in a nora roberts cant put down.. but not unfinished business.. just a ok book for me
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I have only read a few Nora Roberts books and have to say this one was a disappointment, found it very predictable from start to finish. I kept waiting for some kind of twist to make it more interesting, which never happened. If you are looking for a ""very light read"" then you ""might"" enjoy"
4,Great romance,Loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Very easy read and as always it seemed as if I was part of the story. Five stars!!
4,Light and entertaining read.,"I liked and enjoyed this book. Nora Roberts's writiing is phenomenal at best, intense, entertaining, and engrossing. I would recommend this book for a light and entertaining read."
4,"Easy read, Great story","Great story that leaves you feeling good. Easy to read, could not put it down. I am a Nora Roberts fan"
3,Unfinished Business,"While the story line ""unfinished business"" focused on the love story, I whish it had had more of a drawn out line on the parent child renunion."
2,"Ho, hum...","I don't know why I bought another Nora Roberts book. Her stories are formula driven. They remind me of Victoria Holt. There is a story built around the same love-hate, unrequited, undiscovered, conflicted and rediscovered love scenario. The names and characters and settings are changed in each book, but it's the same-old-same-old premise. Boring!!"
4,A good yarn,"This is the story of Vanessa, a brilliant concert pianist, but a completely befuddled human. She's 28 and for the first time in her life, she's making decisions on her own.It's telling that the woman has an ulcer and doesn't know it - refuses to believe it. Illness is a weakness, and she has no weaknesses.Vanessa goes through a catharsis in this story, learning to live with what has happened in her life and correct where she went wrong. She goes home to heal a breach with her mother and heals herself in the process.Oh, and she has a really hot romance.My only problem with the book is that her father, who is revealed as a selfish SOB from almost page one, is never overtly discussed. Or at least, not enough. He is the epicenter of the damage in her life, and he remains an open thread. This is unusual for a NR book, normally she deals with these situations.Anyway, a great early Nora R. entry. WORTH reading!!(*)>"
5,a soulful treasure!,"Anything Cindy Laferle writes will predictably bring you home to what matters most: living gently, simply, with an open mind, a loving heart, and greater appreciation for life. Cindy's words have never failed to inspire me. In fact, on more occasions than I can name, her words have brought me to grateful tears. Her reflections on home, family, and parenting, especially, deeply touch the heart. This collection of essays will fast become one of your favorites. It is one of mine. It makes a wonderful gift book as well."
3,Customers Beware,"Although Bocelli's songs are wonderful as usual, the CD I received only has 10 tracks on it, and is missing the duet with Judy Weiss. This is quite unfortunate since this track is the only reason I purchased the CD. At the time of the order I had too much going on to care about it, but it's still noteworthy for future purchasers.If you purchase this album, do check it to ensure that this track is part of it, as it's a wonderful listen.Since this appears to be the only album that contains this track, I have no other choice but to purchase the entire album again, since no music service seems to carry this song."
4,Best of Bond,I always enjoy listening to this lovely quartet's music.So having not only the CD but the DVD on one disc makes it easyto take along when traveling. And who wouldn't want to be withthem?
2,Wisdom?,"This book left me wanting more...more of the ""Wisdom of Teams"" the predecessor of this book. It was bland. They touched on some real world examples but not enough in my opinion. It was a quick read and felt that it could have been deeper. This book could have developed more specifics into developing single-leader or team disciplines."
3,Not introductory,"I was hoping for a more introductory treatment of the topic of Fourier Series. I am a math instructor trying to get a handle on the topic, and while I can follow the text, it is not one I would recommend to others seeking a high-level explanation and introduction. However, I am still looking and have not yet found a text that doesn't immediately dive into a much more technical explanation than I wish."
4,My thoughts on The Ultimate Rangers DVD,"I thought White Light, Countdown to Destruction, To the Tenth Power and Forever Red were pretty good choices. I didn't agree much with Trakeena's Revenge though, it wasn't that great of an episode. What about Green w/ Evil, anything from Zeo or Turbo. Also, I was disappointed there were no extra features like outtakes etc. I hope DVD sets for each season are put out."
3,Great Indoors...Horrible outdoors,"This works great indoors. The quietness when baby is asleep is nice.. there is no fuzziness to listen to.However, the aspect I needed it for was the long distance range... and in this area it failed. First the baby had to be screaming before the monitor would transmit the sound/alert when outdoors. Second, the ""out-of-range"" beeping would sound within the boundaries 1000ft range -- this I suspect from being blocked by sheds and trees. So, it probably does reach 1000 ft in range distance... but only when there is absolutely no interfering objects.If all you need is indoor use, this is great, but for outdoors... well I'm still searching.One thing the description failed to mention was that this monitor comes with 3 of the needed 6 rechargeable batteries (enough for the parent receiver). And the batteries are recharged by using the provided plug-in adapter."
5,For learning about ABA and relating to school you cannot beat this book...,My title states it all. The 7th edition trumps the phenomenal 6th edition in it's inclusion of IDEA 2004/NCLB concepts. It is well worth the price difference between this book and most ABA books.
4,technical lingo,The only thing I really did not like about this book was it had a lot of technical verbage that tends to put one to sleep. The examples and scenarios were helpful in presenting the content.
5,excellent! Support for the first year,"Fabulous read for those of us following the guaifenesin protocol. I have tried so many treatments for fibromyalgia, both conventional prescription based and alternatives. I can tell you that this is the first real and lasting relief i have received. If your strong, and determined to help yourself get well this is the answer. I am now working, have a social life again and truly feel alive after feeling like my life was one big miserable painfull mess. Thank you Dr. St. Amand and Claudia Marek!"
4,necessary read for fibromites and those around them,"I've been diagnosed with fibro for about 6 yrs now. I have a great deal of denial about this. I kept thinking if I forced myself to suffer through more exercise and just suck up the pain, fatigue, the IC, etc that the fibro would ""go away.""I've been in a bad flare for a few weeks and I picked up this book. The first fibro book I ever read was ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia and Other Invisible Illnesses."" This book is not full of technical jargon, it's down to earth and honest. I like how she reinforces the importance of being your own advocate and taking charge of your health.I decided on this book at this time in my life so that as I start to come out of my denial about having fibro and how bad it can be, I can use this book as a new starting point...a guide to handling things more realistically. I would love it if she had a companion workbook for this. It would be awesome."
4,"A little morbid, but...","I don't like sad movies, but I have to say that this movie is really good. The characters have depth and the storyline is intriguing."
1,Advertising for his web page,"My book came misbound -- the cover was upside down and pages went from back to front like an arabic book.1/3 of the book is filled with some survey material that typically said: I've been a mortgage broker for x years and I really, really like it. I make money and you can too.The rest of book can be condensed into 2 or 3 pages of info that isn't completely obvious. The remainder is a subtle suggestion that the author's web site has more books that are even more fantastic!Very poor book."
2,The book does not worth the money,"The info in this book is very basic, and only would be good for a person just entering the mortgage broker field. A lot of his personal site advertisemt, that is why many people got frustrated after reading this book. I would personally recomment to read All About Mortgages, which is packed with precious information, and notthis one."
2,So you want to be a mortgage Broker,"Its ONE big advert for the mortgage company, 29 pages on how to contact the company and buy more books and items. It does have a couple of chapters that helped me, but its frustrating that it keeps refering to the company that published it, to sell there loan products."
1,Buyer beware,"Reference - I don't think soBasic - At mostHelpful - Not for meThe author has broker training they're trying to sell you. It was obvious to me they have created a new marketing idea to sell you their products. I would not have given it any stars if that were an option. I am going to sell my copy and try to get some of my money back.I have a friend who is a mortgage broker. He believes that some of the statements in the book are questionable.Decide on your own if you want to be a mortgage broker or not. I think the biggest part of the job will be selling your services. Heck if I could make 1% closing mortgages I would do it 24 hours a day. But how are you going to get your business. If you think this book will give you one little hint about how to do that think again. The book tells you they have a course that teaches blah, blah, blah."
1,Not very detailed...,"I bought this to find out about the warning lights my 2001 Maxima had for the catalytic converter (bought a code reader to find out what the ""Service Engine light was trying to tell me) and ABS brakes (ABS light on dash). It did not have any real info about either problem... Not sure who this is really aimed at - certainly not the serious home mechanic... Only paid a couple of bucks (used) so worth a try..."
1,Useless Accessory,"I have to support the previous review, although my problems with it were different. Mine didn't have instructions either and so I put the remote in one way and the nunchuck on it. There was a green light if nothing was in or if the nunchuck was on the remote. The light turned red if just the remote was set in. I tried both ways to see if it would charge with no change. I looked up the company online and saw no reference to instructions or common problems.I took it back to the game store, which usually counsels against buying non-certified products. They were happy to exchange it and recommended NYCO's charger."
5,good water heater,"Heat water very fast, no plastic smell, no complaint. a little bit big for 2 people though."
1,"Hot water smells, tastes like plastic","I purchased this model of T-fal Electric Kettle in Sept 2010. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. HOWEVER, when the water is hot, it takes on the smell & taste of plastic. I expected a little of this in the first few uses as a consequence of the pot being new. But even after all this time -- nearly 2 years -- the taste is so strong that it significantly alters the flavor of teas, hot chocolate, soups and instant coffee.Some readers may wonder if I'm reheating water that has been standing in the pot. No, I empty it, give it a quick rinse and begin fresh each time with cold water from the tap. And there is no unwanted taste in the water before it is heated. I can only conclude that the defect is in the kettle itself. Very disappointing.I cannot recommend this product."
2,Water smells and tastes like plastic,"The heated water still smells and has a platic aftertaste a month after purchase. The water indicator has only 3 measurements .7,1.0,and 1.7L. What does this mean in terms of cups? Not very practical and very disappointing.T-Fal Vitesses 1.7L (7-Cup) Electric Kettle"
2,the smell,"I wanted to like this kettle. I really did. Based on features, it should get a 4. If only it didn't stink.It was to be a replacement for a stainless steel Breville that started tripping the GFI outlet. The troubleshooting instrucions said to boil the pot with 2 tsp of baking soda. That didn't help - still a strong chemical odor. Tried white vinegar as well. First 1/2 cup plus water, then all vinegar. Still the smell. After a total of 15 pot-fulls, some baking soda, some vinegar, some plain water, the smell was diminished a bit but still present.I called the manufacturer and was told they'd replace the pot, but that they were out of stock and would take at least 3 weeks.I'm returning it for another stainless kettle."
4,T-fal Vitesse Electric Kettle,"The kettle heats the water very fast,within a minute. I love everything about it. I just wish it had a position on the knob of the kettle or on the base that would keep the water hot for a given amount of time. That is if I chose to."
5,t-fal vitesse 1.7liter electric kettle,"I am very pleased with this purchase - well-priced and delivers hot water in mere minutes. It has replaced a larger capacity Japanese thermos-style hot pot which had to be kept plugged in so the water would stay hot. Now I just plug in this smaller model whenever I want hot or lukewarm water (love the option of how hot I want my water)and voila! This T-Fal 1.7L unit takes up way less room on my counter, is esthetically pleasing to look at and quite sturdy. I had looked at several other models at Bed, Bath & Beyond as well as Target, and they all felt flimsy. Very happy with my purchase!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,Plastic smell is terrible!! the taste was even worse!! I called manufacturer t-fal to complain. I sent product to them!! Waiting to hear .
5,Quick boil,Very convenient for a quick boil. Probably the best electric kettle there is on the market. I wish there is a smaller model for the practical side of it since I rarely boil more than a liter of water. Very satisfy with this product.
2,it stinks - literally,"purchased this as replacement for another kettle. boiled and discarded water several times. put in baking soda per instructions for plastic taste - did not help. made kitchen stink of plastic. water dribbles out from under lid, not just spout - dangerous. rather heavy. made in China. slow to boil."
1,not worth the money...,"I recieved this toy as a gift for my then 8 month old daughter. She was more interested in the box it came in than anything else. Like many have said, the base is too narrow, and she was always tipping it over which caused her to tip over as well resulting in lots of crying. They could have at least put more activites on the toy, music or lights. Maybe, then the toy would be worth the money. As is, this toy isn't worth a buck."
4,"Fun, but not very safe.","I just bought this for my daughter. She really enjoys it, but, as a walker, it is somewhat unstable and rolls so fast that she ends up on her knees (or her face). Also, the space in the back is too small for a child just learning to walk to stay in. It's probably best for children who are already walking."
2,Dangerous on hardwood floors,"As a walker, this toy too slippy for hardwood floors. Every time my 12 month pre-walker pushes it, the wheels skid on the floor - they are very light plastic and they do not even roll on our floors so most times the toy slips across the floor with my son ending up belly down on the floor. I think it would work better on carpeted floors but it's too dangerous if you have wooden floors. My son has no interest in the toy anymore, doesn't even play with the attachments on the front of it."
2,Not worth it.,"We received this toy as a gift. Actually, we received two of them! Very nice of the people who bought them for us, however, this is not a durable toy at all. It's very flimsy. My daughter fell over on it immediately. And what's with that thing sticking out of the back of it? It has ""put an eye out"" written all over it. It's not durable as a car and it's flimsy as a walker (there's absolutely NO resistence, so unless the child's an excellent walker already, he or she is going to fall). The plastic even feels thin. There's a little thing on it that spins and every few days or so when my daughter passes the toy, she spins it for a few seconds and then moves on. Definitely not worth the price!"
1,Doesn't roll well,"I wouldn't recommend buying this. It doesn't roll well on the floor at all. My daughter (1 year old) was sitting on it with my husband calling for her to come to him. She couldn't push it, but ended up falling off cause it wouldn't roll. Don't buy this one."
3,Wheels dont move smoothly,This is a great walker. Both my daughters love the toys on it. The trunk is a big hit(they love to put anything they can find in it including mommys keys). The only reason I rated this a 3 star is that the wheels dont move very smoothly. The regular ride-ons move around the house better. Therefore my daughters never really liked it as a car.
2,Im returning it!,"After one day of buying this toy, I noticed that when it is set up as a push toy, the wheels are too close to each other and it makes my son kick it and lean forward too much while walking. Also when in the ride on position, the handle is too close to my son, making it hard for him to use. I will be returning it!"
2,Not so great,"I might have gotten this for my son when he was getting a little too old for it. But he never really seemed interested in it. He is tall for his age and this toy is really short when put in the option to ride it. It has been durable, although he does not really use it."
3,Watch your fingers!,The wheels don't turn well enough to use as either a walker or a rider. And watch it when you switch modes... I got my finger caught in there and it was impossible to get free....OOOOUUCH!
5,Great for Babies and Toddlers!,"I bought this for my daycare, My smallest one is 8mo. He can ride on it pretty good and he isn't walking yet. He loves to open the hood and find a toy that we put in there. He also has fun playing with the other toys on it. It is low to the ground, so if the child slides off they won't get hurt. My older children love this also. Its great!"
5,Works,"Works as needed, Typical Playskool toy, easy enough to put together. Not as big as I had hoped, but works. Niece loved it, easy purchase :)"
3,its ok,"Nothing special but does everything it says it does, very cheaply made though. I wouldn't buy again if I had the choice"
3,Great to play with - but hard to set up!,"My 11 month old son thinks this walker is the best thing ever. It is bright, durable and doesn't topple over easily. I did find it a bit tough to put together - I pinched my finger while pushing in the antenna and the wheels needed a very hard smack to get them into position!"
2,She didn't learn to walk with this...I can tell you that!,I bought this walk n ride for my youngest when she was almost ready to walk (about 11 months). She wouldn't fool with it too much but instead use the shopping cart I had when my oldest was young. She preferred the shopping cart even though it moved more quickly but she would always reach for the shopping cart first. I still have the walk n ride but its sitting in the backyard. I seem to remember her feet tripping on the wheels while using as a walker. I think there are better walkers out there.
3,lots of fun but isn't very durable,"We got this toy as a gift. It is my sons favorite toy, but it broke in about 1 month. Now it is duc taped in place. semms to be working fine now, but who knows for how long...."
3,Cute!,This is cute but mostly was used to teach my younger one to walk as they never used any of the activities on it or ever rode on. Also made a great dangerous step for my son to push to something and attempt to stand on it and fall. Just buy the regular stand up push toy.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this for my son and I had a couple of problems with it. First when he tried to walk with it, there was not enough room for him to walk. The wheel part of it is either too wide or not wide enough. Second when then toy is in the ""ride"" position, my son would pull it in the ""walk"" position, but because it was not made to secure in by me it would crash down and startle him. I would not recommend this toy at all. My son never played with it."
2,Back too wide for riding,"My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. The trunk and other little extras are fun, but she can't make it move when she sits on it. Her feet hit the back end because it is so wide. It didn't help her as a walk behind, either, because the handle is low and forward of her feet -- she'd end up leaning over her toes. She also has the Little Tykes Speed Racer and she LOVES it - at about the same price, it's a much better choice."
3,Not worth it.,"I got this for my daughter last Christmas when she was 10 months old and just beginning to walk. The base is too narrow for her to walk easily. Like other reviewers, we have found moving from the riding mode into the walker mode difficult and less than stable from a safety standpoint. In the riding mode, it is heavier and lower to the ground than a Fisher-Price rider she received as a gift from her aunt. Therefore it is more difficult for her to push and she now likes the Fisher-Price rider better. About the only thing my daughter likes to do with this toy is put things in the trunk and that alone is not worth the purchase price. I do not recommend this rider."
4,My son loved it,"My son loved this toy. He walked behind it a little, but really enjoyed it as a ride-on car. I gave it three stars on durability because after about a year the wheels started coming off. He had outgrown it by this time anyway. I had to sneak it out during naptime, just so I could get rid of it! If your looking for something to last forever this is not the toy, but if you need it to last for one child then this is the one!"
2,Hard to use for toddlers and boring for bigger kids,"This toy seems to be a good idea, but doesn't perform. In walker mode it tips too easily for learners and in ride-on mode the child's foot gets stuck on the little antenna on the back. Takes up space and never got played with. I have twins and babysit triplets and still it didn't get much use."
4,Lots of fun - but very light,"We bought this for our son when he was first learning to walk. He shrieked with delight the first few times he walked behind it. Very fun toy.The downside is that it is very light and tippy. Parents, you MUST walk along with your child and this toy until they are absolutely walking 100% on their own.On the upside, it's inexpensive and easy to switch between walk-behind and ride-on. Small and light enough to pack in the car for weekend getaways."
1,Dangerous Toy,"I liked this toy a lot at first. The idea of being able to push and ride was great. But twice my son fell while using it and cut himself. The not-so-sharp plastic edges of the toy cut him above the eye and on the lip, both times leaving cuts that I debated getting stitched. The toy is now in my garbage can. Live and learn."
2,Decent walker...,"This makes a decent walk-behind toy, but it's pretty bad as a ride-on toy. The rear wheels are set further apart than the front wheels. This design makes it easy for the child to walk behind and not trip over the wheels, but it makes it difficult for the child to keep their feet clear of the rear wheels in ride-on mode. If you're looking for something that's truly dual-purpose, look elsewhere. Also, not the most important thing to consider, but it's really ugly. Unless you live at the circus, this thing will stick out like...well, like an ugly piece of plastic. If everything else was top-notch, I could overlook the vomit-inspired color scheme, but there are many better-looking options out there that probably work as well or better than this."
2,A little too little,"We bought this for our daughter when she was around 11 months and standing but not walking. She used it mainly in her room on carpet. The toy is really light so in the ""push mode"" she managed to build up a lot of speed in a small space. A couple of times she tipped it over. She really seemed to prefer to push around a jumbo sized pampers box. Now she is walking she hardly looks at this toy. She is tall so when she does sit on it in ""car mode"" she is too big to push forward - she can only push backwards which seems to get old really fast. Considering all this and the amount of space this toy takes up, if I had to do it over I would probably pass."
5,Great Toy for my 10 month old girl!,"My daughter is too small to sit on it on her own, but she loves being on it with our help!"
1,Not what it seems,I was excited to get this toy for my 11 month old son but when I did I was disappointed. You have to assemble the toy yourself and it's not easy. The wheels do not spin and the multiple parts fall off. I was uncomfortable having my son use it to stand up or push it while walking.
2,"Good for Riding, Terrible for Walking","This toy has been through both of my kids now and I've had the same experience with both: this toy is just fine as a ""riding/scooting"" toy but is terrible as a ""learn to walk"" toy. The problem is there is very little to no resistance in the wheels so as soon as you begin to push on the handle, it goes rolling. This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it, it shoots forward. This is probably a larger problem on my hardwood floors but I can't see it being significantly better on carpet.The good side of the toy is that it is well sized for a riding toy. The handle is place well and my kids were/are able to get on and off easily by themselves."
2,Not worth the money,"My 9 month old is starting to walk and I thought that this would be a perfect toy for her. I was wrong. She likes to play with the activity toys on the outside, but when she pulls herself up, the handle falls down. It is not sturdy at all. When she tries sitting on it, she wants to play with the activity toys and she falls off. I'm going to try another toy and the Step Start/Walk N' Ride is going in the trash."
2,Cute - but not sized for &amp;amp;quot;usability,"We got this for our son when he was 9 months old. At that point in time he couldn't walk yet - but he was very interested in using it as a ride-on rather than pushing it. At 9 months he was the right size to use it as a ride on, but his skill level was not there yet. He's now 18 months and is too big to use it as a ride-on toy. In fact he only got to use it as a ride-on from 12 1/2 months to 15 or 16 months. That's a very short window of opportunity. At 18 months it's too low to the ground and the room between the front and back wheels is much too short for him to get a decent range of motion as he propels himself. This is unfortunate because at 18 months he is VERY into ride-on's (he calls them go-toys) and this one is no longer usable. So, it was fine for a walk-behind while learning to walk - but it didn't 'grow' with my son as advertised...."
3,Great concept - but my 10 month old doesn't know what to do!,"My daughter is 10 months old (was pre-mature and in ICU for a long while) and she doesn't know how to make it move. She likes to sit on it, but that is all she does. We have purchased a giraffe that she can ride and she knows how to move this one, it is just a little too tall so we bought the Playschool Walk 'n Ride too. Unfortunetly, she likes to play with the wheels and the other moveable pieces but doesn't like to move it while she is on it (and not quite walking)!"
3,"Not as good as the others, but still a good read","Usually, this series is fabulous. This book did not measure up to the formar standred. This talks about hevier subjects then the other books, and in not such a humerous way as the others. Overall, just so-so."
5,Discovered right on time,"Byron Brown captures every feeling I've felt in the past 3 years and addresses it simply by not determining it as good or bad but just the way it is. You can choose to continue to try to conform or you can realize that you have, along with your inner judge, the capacity to step out of bounds and make a singular decision from your soul, if you can find your soul."
3,Go to the head of the class,"I suppose it's always advisable to go to the source of the material. Whereas Bryon does justice to the subject matter; quite honestly, it doesn't hold a candle to Almaas' master works which do address this subject with great profundity."
4,Charming,"A nice, quiet tale to read your child during bedtime. Soft, tasteful pictures fit perfectly to a story about a mother's enduring love. Sweet."
4,Touching,A way for you to break out of a shell of your own. Beautiful! I cannot believe the skill that Stephanie Lisa Tara writes this book with. Truly amazing!
4,Very good CD...could've been better,"Way too much rap...other than that, it's a really good CD! Here are my predictions/WANTS for volume 2:1. Kimberly Locke - ""8th World Wonder""2. Avril Lavigne - ""Don't Tell Me""3. 3 Doors Down - ""Away From the Sun""4. Cheri - ""I'm Ready""5. Hilary Duff - ""Come Clean""6. Outkast - ""The Way You Move""7. Jessica Simpson - ""Take My Breath Away""8. Joss Stone - ""Fell In Love With a Boy""9. Lenny Kravitz - ""Where Are We Running?""10. Linkin Park - ""Numb""11. Los Lonely Boys - ""Heaven""12. Maria Mena - ""You're the Only One""13. Evanesence - ""My Immortal""14. Switchfoot - ""Meant To Live""15. The Darkness - ""I Believe In a Thing Called Love""16. Yellowcard - ""Ocean Avenue""17. Train - ""When I Look To the Sky""18. Blink-182 - ""I Miss You""19. Hoobastank - ""The Reason""20. Britney Spears - ""Everytime"""
2,Proofread please!!,"There is nothing that annoys me more than seeing ""looser"" used in place of ""loser"". The writing in this book reeks of internet message boards. I see that it was edited by Mark Barfield. Is English Mr. Barfield's native language? This may have been a good read if it had been better written, but as it is I can only give it two stars."
2,These are not Zanies,"Although these come up when searching for Zanies furballs, they aren't ; they're called ""Bat Around."" Note that other reviewers say they're not as good with the polyester filling. My foster kittens go absolutely nuts for Zanies, so that's what I'm sticking with. The real ones areZanies Canister Cat Toys 60 Fur Balls 2 In"
4,An excellent mystery-thriller for teenagers.,"Several teenagers recieve blackmail threats from a mysterious source. One of Pike's earlier books, this is a straight mystery, without any of the gory attempts at emulating Stephen King"
2,"Get your own idea, Pike!","Well, what can I say about this book? I suppose there were soome scary parts, but the book never seemed to end! While the book differs in many ways, the plot is very similar to Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer. Some group of drunken teenagers hit and kill someone in a car accident, and decide to cover it up, then a year later someone comes after them in revenge. I Know What You Did... was in fact written more than ten years before Chain Letter. Plus, Chain Letter was tasteless, and ridiculous. And I have just learned that there is a sequel to Chain Letter, and I now feel an obligation to read it. This book is a must miss!"
3,Very heavy,"A solid cane but very, very heavy. I'm strong enough that it doesn't bother me much but someone who is frail would have difficulty using this cane."
2,Too Heavy,I have a cane by same company that is really light and easy to use. I ordered 2 additional canes to keep in car and work for easy access. But these canes are very heavy compare to the one I already have. Bad choice on my part.
4,Entertaining,"I rated this book 4-stars because I thought it was very entertaining. I was a graduate student in physics in 1974 when the J/psi particle was discovered. This book gave me more insight into the events that lead to its discovery -- a history that I really enjoyed.For those who are looking for detailed physics, they won't find it here. Dr. Riordan describes various experiments at different facilities but does not provide enough background for those not familiar with particle physics.Overall, I really enjoyed the book as one person's account of the events leading us to where we are today in the standard model. This book is well written and easy to read."
2,"No, no, no","This completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original. Overblown, overproduced Mackintosh garbage. If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated. Mr. Banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst. And the omission of ""Sister Suffragettes"" smacks of PC nonsense."
5,Poppins is Poppin,Excellent version of the Broadway show. Some new songs enhance the reason to purchase this version.
2,Be careful - watch how your baby reacts,"My 11 month old boy loves baby einstein, baby genius, and first impressions. This video begins with a beautiful Bach piece and some black and white bars slowly moving. However after 2 minutes or so of watching this video my baby began crying apparently because a freaky face was drawn. When the face started eating things I had to turn the video off because it was really scaring him. The video has a creepy feel as the images slowly change unexpectedly. However, the black and white pictures might be nice for a newborn or a baby who doesn't get scared by the images."
5,Excellent visual stimulation - sights & sounds,My two year old grandson has watched this video since he was 6 months old and still loves it. It is a great video to watch together close to bedtime because the soothing classical music is a great relaxer (especially for those over-nighters away from home.
1,"highly overrated, not very practical","I was very disappointed with this book. It doesn't provide the real world facts about making an indie film as other books do. It reads like an introductory textbook that skates over all the issues, but never really tells you the things you want to know about how to finance, cast, and sell an indie. Don't waste your money here."
1,Not much fun at all!,"First of all, no tutorials! It took me almost an hour to learn how to brush and feed the horse! Other Let's Ride games, such as Silver Buckle Stables, explained EVERYTHING! Another is how slow everything is-especially the days. A normal day isn't that slow (for me, anyway)! I also can't believe how dirty a single horse can get within five minutes! The only good thing about this game is the information you can fill in about your horse and the color selection. Maybe the graphics, too. Before my mom bought this for me, I thought it was going to be as good as Silver Buckle Stables. Now, I wish she spent the money for this game on Spore or My Horse and Me. Believe me, this game is not worth your money! Let's Ride disappointed me this time."
1,book was dirty,the book had black messy dark marks that cleaned up with a wipe. it better to receive a nice clean book.
3,It's a reference book,"Just a word of clarification, especially to those new to this kind of material (like myself). This book is like a catalog of monologues and scenes, but does not reprint the actual scenes. You'll need to find the actual scripts elsewhere."
4,Take the legs & train off,"Not sturdy at all, but my son loves this toy. It tips over easily if he tries to pull himself up on it. I have removed the legs and leave it as a floor toy and he loves to push all the buttons. The train pulled right off (more then once) so I leave it off now."
3,Slightly flawed,"This album begins good, with ""Need You Bad"" making the grade. Ainger Charlie Huhn also has a good voice. But the songs themselves and production are lacking. This was the beginning of the fall for Mr. Ego. But, overall, I think this is a still enjoyable album."
5,"This is a great Nugent Album,front to back,it ROCKS.","This was the first Ted Nugent album I bought many moons ago,it was great then and it's great now it has a steady pase from begining to end.after this I ended up with a closet full of Nugent albums,most preaty damn good,if you like this style of rock you can't miss with this one,next try double live gonzo,a true classic for the true Nugent Fan.The rare form of Venom soup,and good friends on this one are not found on a lot of other one's and its worth having just for those 2 alone,the rest just top off the glass.if you like nugent buy it you wont be dissapointed.TJ--Texas."
2,Mediocre entre to statistical analysis,"I used the 7th Edition in a graduate course in statistics and was frustrated both by the text's poor organization and its failure to present key statistical concepts clearly. I had to resort frequently to other sources to clarify topics that were poorly presented in the Prentice Hall text, and tended to find much simpler explanations outside of the text. The problem sets are particularly troublesome, as many of them do not appear to relate to the section in which they are contained and insufficient explanations are offered in the answer key. I recommend you look elsewhere."
4,Very good,"This is a very strong performance from the Met. Terrific orchestra conducted by James Levine, excellent sound on the DVD (I listened in stereo). Right away with the overture you know you are in for a treat. Traditional, grand staging in the Met. manner -- no attention-grabbing Euro silliness or time-shifting confusion. As for the singers, they are all good, and some are excellent. Maria Guleghina isn't pitch-perfect 100% of the time, but she has a tremendous expressive range and can pull off this most difficult of parts. Juan Pons as Nabucco is commanding, and vulnerable when the role calls for it. Gwyn Hughes-Jones, a tenor, as Ismaele, was very impressive -- I had not heard him before and had no expectations but he has a very strong and beautiful voice, acted well, and was clearly working hard (he's sweating like a pig inside of five minutes into Act I). Wendy White and Samuel Ramey (who has never been all that impressive to me) were fine."
2,not great,"It has some of the same chapters that are on volume 1, also it has fewer episodes than volume 1.It's good but it could be better."
1,a let down,"this book sucks.it ommitts the songs:'when i'm 64','baby's in black','things we said today','i'm down','two of us',I me mine','i'll follow the sun','the fool on the hill','Yer blues','got to get you into my life','for you blue','she's a woman','octopus' garden',among others!what it does include however are:'and your bird can sing',and 'sun king'-two songs lennon himself called ""throwaways""!Also,it includes what the authors like about each particular song.does anybody care?THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!"
1,Is this book a joke?,"This book CANT have been written by two beatles' fans!All the great songs that are left out,and some really crappy songs left in the so called ""100 best"".IT it a joke?Somebody tell me!Is it a joke?It doesn't even include 'yellow submarine',a #1 that they named and made a film after!How is this possible?But they include 'and your bird can sing'?That crap!Is this book a joke?"
1,worthless!,"All the pictures inside are in black and white,don't let the color photos on the cover fool you!It ommitts alot of good songs;for example: 'yellow submarine'(whitch was a #1 hit for the beatles,by the way)!It includes bad songs like 'good morning,good morning'(a song john lennon called ""garbage""),and ""sun king""(""just one of my leftover pieces of crap from India"").I don't care what these two IDIOTS like about each individual song if they include throwaway songs instead of a #1 hit!Ther're opinions are worthless,and this book is worthless!Read 'A hard days write' instead!"
2,Very weak... and a hint of plastic?,"The sachets come individually wrapped in plastic baggies. For a large cup (say ~16 oz), you'd need 3-4 sachets to brew a tea that wasn't obviously weak. I tried it well before the box's expiration date, so that wasn't the problem. As the tea soaked in the water, it seemed to develop a faint taste of plastic. Not sure where that's coming from. Could be the baggie it was in or the sachet, which is made out of some kind of plastic fabric."
1,Disappointment,"When I order items from amazon or any products for home delivery I expect some rough handling throughout shipping, that's why I don't order a dozen eggs or Faberge eggs for that matter. A Stainless Steel Spur should be ok to get to my home in decent condition, it is STEEL! Well that's not the case with the one I received, several of the spikes were bent on the wheel. To just blame the mail carrier would be easy but the perfect condition of the envelop makes me doubt that, this was just poor follow through on the part of the shipper hobbytoolsupply. It took me two seconds to examine the spur and grasp that several of the spikes were bent, you would think at least they could do that, is this really too much to ask?! Good thing there are many other choices in who I buy from, because if I see the name hobbytoolsuply next to a product I'm moving on... and I recommend you do the same."
4,Replacement Copy,I bought this book to replace the one I lost when our house burned in 2010. When I was in high school I used the instructions for the orchid to do a project for my art class. It turned out beautifully and while the book was a tremendous help I will have to admit that my Art Teacher helped fill out what instruction the book did not.It is suitable for a beginner to help them get started in the pastel medium but only for the very basics of drawing and using pastels. I did not give it five stars because like all Walter Foster books it is only a very basic instruction manual.
5,How to Write a Novel,"A brilliant tale of how best to go about writing the all-American novel. Or British. Whatever. I carry this book close to my heart, as do all serious authors."
4,very sweet!,"This release has really grown on me...This album really has the complete package; nice tunes and great soloing. Even though some of this gets into the sphere of smooth jazz, it's all really well done.Sterns soloing is great throughout (no surprise), and I especially like his performance on the title track. I might even like the overall production here (working with Steve Khan) better than on Upside/Downside... very nice.As a bonus, Peter Erskine is on drums (his playing is always so tasteful.) No Notice features guest Don Grolnick on organ, and check out the blowing Bob Berg does on this one!Shawn"
5,Awsome,"I'm not a musician and I can understand this album rocks. Everybody is just great at every postion they're in. The last song is my favorite; it has a funky bass line and a solo which is just mind blowing. Everytime I listen to it, I feel a musicians' pain when they go ""OOOHHHH NOOOOOO!"" It's a really cool funky blues album for those who like this stuff."
4,decent watch!,very attractive face.as with most casios it functions flawlessly. good buy for the money. however it feels a bit too ligh for a mans watch
4,Overall it is a great book for repairs of any level.,"The book is a well put together repair manual covering virtually ever aspect of maintenance and repair. I, being an inexperienced mechanic, was still able to do many of the repairs. I did find the text a bit difficult when it came to figuring out what part they were referring to. The detail they gave was excellent with a diagram for all models. It is a must for any Honda Civic owner."
3,Better than Hays,This is a fair book. Deffinatly better than Hays. Where hays explanes things in one sentence Chilton uses an entire paragraph. However it does not contain all the diagnosis I wanted and it is plagued with misprints and occasionaly contridicts itself.
3,Of Particular Interest to Bush Watchers,"""Purple Dots"" is causing talk in Austin at the moment for two reasons: it's being used as an example of what's wrong with political parking perks as Mayor Watson is trying to make nice with Austin-bashing legislators, and some Bush watchers may be reading its description of CIA director of covert Operations ""Bushong"" (p.37) as a thinly-veiled satire directed at Dad and, by implication, Texas Governor Bush. As for the novel, itself, it does fall apart at the end, but up to that point it's decent reading for anyone interested in the ins and outs of Washington politics as seen by an insider. What Politex finds particularly interesting is Lehrer's ""Brooks Brothers"" style, a use of language and a way of thinking from a recent, by-gone era that his loyal readers probably find comforting."
5,Worth it.,"Big enough for my sunglasses, easily and good protection. Worth the price for a useful and mobile carrying case. Only complaint is that it's bulky to fit in a cargo shorts pocket"
4,Great Case for just about anything small,"If you are looking for a solid case that will hold and protect your sunglasses, ipod or a GPS, this is the case for you. It is surprisingly durable. All in all a great product.My only negative is that its size is larger than most sunglasses and they tend to rattle around unless you can get some foam to pack them in. It would have been nice if the manufacturer would have included foam with the case, but I was able to pick up some at the local hardware store for very little cost."
2,Cheap MOLLE strap snap,"Case itself is great, like Oakley case plus some cool attachment design. But the snap closure on the MOLLE strap is completely useless! It does not close at all, when the package arrived from Amazon, it was wide open, and they just don't stay closed! Wow, what a deal breaker that is, because I was going to attach this to my third line gear to keep my eyepro safe. Total failure Civilian Lab."
5,Not enough stars in the rating system for this masterpiece,"This is one of my faves when it comes to the Cat Who series. The clues (cheese names....I won't spoil it for you!) and interesting characters like Mr. Limburger who is as odious in personality as his name suggests, gentle Aubrey the bee keeper with a heart bigger than his brain, Onoosh, the mysterious woman. I won't go on, I might spoil things.Other clues (what Qwill finds in his ready-to-cook turkey)and other goings on, and the ""coverage"" of the Pickax Hotel bombing....nicely narrated. Though through Koko's catly fits (which is caught on tape at the cheese tasting at Qwill's apple barn and distributed by others for the laughs) we start to piece together who, and then later why. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book.As a long time fan of Braun I say this is one of her best. But start at the beginning...to see Qwill and Koko's genesis and struggles. What they had to do to get where they are now."
5,After reading hardcore mystery novels this book is refreshin,"The cats in this book are hysterical. I've been reading hardcore mystery novels from artists like John Grisham. This is a refreshing approach and since I'm a cat lover this book is great. I've ordered two more of her novels today from Amazon.Com. Great plot! I went to the book store in search of a mystery novel about cats that my Uncle in WV had told me about. I found two different artists, Ms. Braun and Rita Mae Brown mystery books with cats. Both are great reads and completely different."
4,This book was very engaging!!,"Lilian Jackson Braun's books always keep my attention. Despite the fact that I am a cat lover and enjoy reading about Koko and Yum Yum, I also enjoy the quality of the book. I enjoy her book's lack of profanity, as well as the way she can turn a simple event in Moose county into the talk of the town. Also her ability to turn Koko and Yum Yum into new and interesting investigators in every book without sounding old. I would reccomend her books to anyone who likes good, clean, mysteries"
5,"a wild, inspiring read","While I question much of Free John's intentions and consider him to be something of a self-aggrandizing narcissist, this book is well worth reading. It's an account of several months in 1974 when the Guru engaged his community in a series of outrageous sexual and ecstatic practices perhaps intended to open his devotees to the immanent divine. Was Da really just doing this to gratify himself, was he serving his devotees in this wild way, or both? In any case, it's a potent vision of spiritual practice that is all-inclusive. In this half-dead age, the presence of such a spiritual wildman, even a (quite possibly)crazed one, is a phenomenon worthy of deep consideration."
3,Good buy but could be a slight bit better,I purchased this watch about a year ago. The watch does everything I expected it to but even for the close to 50 bucks I paid for the watch I would desire a light for the digital clock piece and My watches hour and minute hands do not illuminate at all after about 30 minutes. This is probably a quality issue as others have said their watches are illuminated very brightly. If the part worked well I would have given the watch 4 stars but because this and no light on the digital clock part I have to give it 3 stars. My other watch is a Tag and for what you pay for this watch it is a good deal if you can handle no light and illumination hit and miss.
4,jason,"This is a great watch I'm replacing one that I bought 17 years ago, and would buy this watch over and over again. It is reliable and worth every penny."
2,Close but no cigar,"Nice looking watch, great value, but flawed. The radium or whatever material is applied to the watch hands and hour markers to allow night vision is not adequate - the hour marks stay visible for some time but the hour marks fade almost immediately. So at night you can't tell what time it is.Also, the button mechanism that steps you through the various digital tasks works only occassionally.I should have sent it back right away."
3,"Love the Look and Feel of the Watch, But Band Just Snapped","I have absolutely loved this watch for the short time that I've worn it, but the watch band that it came with just literally tore. I wore this watch frequently, but not every day, and I work in an office; I wasn't that tough on the thing. In my opinion, a watch like this should last for many more years than this did for me. I specifically bought the watch believing that the band would be durable, and it was not. It's a good-looking watch and I never had any problem with the mechanics or function of the watch. Too bad the band could have been made more durable. Just thought I'd let everyone know."
4,Si tuviera luz le doy 5 estrellas,"Este reloj es genial, muy buena construcción, diseño clásico pero atractivo. Muy buen precio.Lo único que le falta es la luz, las manecillas y horas vienen en material fosforescente pero no retiene la luz toda la noche.El envío exacto con la fecha programada!Pura Vida!"
4,A good cd / underappreciated.,"By the time the 80's rolled around, Robin Trower had become somewhat of a relic. Hair-metal was the order of the day. The surprising thing about this cd is RT's ability to merge his classic guitar-riff music with an overall updated sound. The first song, Tear it Up is worth the price of admission. Most of his faithfull fans probably own this disc already. It may not rank with his classic Bridge of Sighs, but still a good guitar rock disc. A good one to add to your collection."
3,Good if it has all the parts!,"My first one of these arrived missing a couple panels and one of the plastic ""hubs"" so it was a 14-shoe holder. It's kind of a nuisance to assemble - the hubs are of the ""press to fit"" variety. I do really like that each cubby can hold a pair of men's 11 shoes. This has made my bedroom a much less hazardous place."
1,Horrible product,This product is so difficult to snap together. Ikea furniture is a breeze comparatively. I thought I would take 20 minutes and it has turned into 1 hour a day for 3 days as it was so frustrating I had to stop. I would not recommend this product at all.
1,Not Worth It!,"I have worked on putting this storage unit together for the past 3 days. It is very frustrating and the little plastic pieces that should ""snap on"" are so fragile I've broken 3 of them so now I'm a couple short to complete the project. Now that I have it FINALLY put together I'm afaid to touch it for fear that it will fall apart. Not a good buy."
4,User-configurable,"You need a leather hammer or rubber mallet to put this thing together. It's user-configurable so I made it to fit the space I had available. That was why I ordered it and it works well for that. Each cube holds one or two pairs of shoes, depending on the size (I wear a woman's size 8). It's not attractive, nor is it ugly, it is nondesript, and efficient."
2,Not good for the price,Very important note:see the dimensions before you order this product.I bought the similar product from costco with the same price it was very good and more space to keep adult shoe. And it comes with 20 shelves. This one is very small the quality is very poor and it comes with only 16 shelves. This product is for kids shoe.
1,Terrible product,"Unless you are buying this for a Toddler....save your money!!! It is very cute, but impractical for any person over 3!!! There is a reason they don't give you the dimensions!!!"
3,England for Snobbies,"NOthing in the Amazon notes tipped me off that this book omits Manchester, Birmingham, and Bristol because they have ""nothing to offer the first- time visitor"". I am a second-time visitor, and plan to make many more trips to Manchester, where my son lives. I am collecting reference books about England, for myself and family. I gave this one to my sister, who was disappointed and surprised that Manchester was omitted. There is more to England than London and the Cotswolds, and I think this author needs to wake up ........OR give the book a different title, such as ""What I think you should see in England"". As far as I know, no other city in England has the Imperial War Museum North, the Manchester United Soccer Team, the convenient airport, etc, etc, etc. This book could also be entitled ""Portions of England for Dummies"". It is not a good reference book."
3,Helpful but limited,"My cats are affected adversely by the flea medications and essential oils are deadly for felines. So, I tried the Neem oil. It was somewhat helpful but I found that diatomaeous earth (food grade for application directly to their body and regular applied around the house), along with flea traps seemed to have a more noticeable affect. Every animal and situation is different, so I'm not sure whether I'd recommend this product or not. Sorry."
4,stinks but work,"My daughter's guinea pig came from the pet store expecting - and also had mange mites. Because of the babies, I couldn't use typical vet remedies to treat it and read about neem oil on line. It does really smell bad-so bad that her babies would not come near her for about an hour after using. It took a few weeks of treatment-mixing with olive oil, rubbing in fur and washing out- but it did get rid of the mites and the fur that had come out is growing back in. I would use it again if troubles arises."
4,Exactly as advertised,"It keeps the fleas away and I like not having to put crazy chemicals on my animals. But it stinks to high heaven. The smell fades after a couple of days, but it's stronger than I would have believed until I experienced it."
4,This is nice.,I love crystals and this is a nice crystal - I like to hang my outside where the sun hits them all the time.
3,Webisodes not included,Show would get 5 stars but loses 2 stars for not including the webisodes. There is no good reason for not including them. Perhaps they were afraid to show the gay chacacter that is revealed in them.
2,"i like the show, the 'extras' suck","they have lots of 'in' jokes/humor, why do I care as a fan? I want the extras to understand more about the show - check out Lord of the Rings (can any of you compare to Peter Jackson?)...."
1,I was sold crap,"I bought the blu ray edition of BSG thinking it was a step above dvd, but to my shock none of the disks work in any of my blu ray players. I have three players and each time the disk is invalid/unreadable. I have never been so damn angry, this $170.00 product is totally useless to me so i am getting my money back for sure. Note: I am not saying the show itself is bad, i love the show thats why i wanted it in HD."
5,Great Series Re-Make,"I received a very good price for this series on blu ray through Amazon and it was worth every penny. This show was a rare jewel in today's field of mindless, insipid and vapid television programs. I really think the producers should consider re-making the orginal series at the time of the height of the Cylon War just before the colonies are destroyed. Given the level of talented writers and an actors they were able to recruit for this past series they would be able to crown their success with another blockbuster hit."
5,"""Battlestar Galactica""","Absolutely great! Just wish there were a second series of ""Battlestar Galactica"".... and who wouldn't love a collectible cylon? M"
2,Packing makes me wish I never bought the series....,"Ok, so even I was wondering HOW BAD could packaging be when I saw how many people complained over it but it's BAD. Cheap crappy cardboard inlets for your DVD's so they all pretty much fall out and go all over the place....Not to mention this doesn't include the mini-series.My advice to everyone is to stay away and just buy them individually."
3,bsg review,i absolutely love battlestar galactica that being said i hate this box set and heres why. the discs are held in place by the most flimsy peice of cardboard i have ever seen. said cardboard is far from secure and is more likely to damage the discs than hold them securely. each season has its own set however there is ABSOLUTELY no episode guide no special feature guide or even a simple list of whats actually in each section. looking for a particular episode? good luck finding it if u dont have an idetic memory and know exactly which disk its on. oh and the cylon toy/figurine looks and feels like a cereal box toy. its big its technically acurate but if you intend to buy this item for it your wasting your time. in short buy the individual seasons seperately it may cost more but is a much better investment.
3,"Great series, lousy packaging","This is a GREAT series - perhaps my alltime favorite TV series - and it is nice to have it all in one place. There are two problems however. First, the grainy look to the series makes differences between the DVDs (which I also own) and these new Blurays fairly small. It is really only on the outdoor shots, or on a really big screen that the Blurays distinguish themselves (delete one star). Second, and more significantly, the packaging is terrible (delete another star). Not sure who thought it was a good idea to include a telescoping box that doesn't fit on most shelves: IT'S NOT! Further, and this strains credibility, nowhere in the set is there any indication of which episodes are on which discs - beyond deliniating the different seasons. Without disc contents, finding a particular episode with current bluray player load speeds is tedious. Sure, you can print out your own 'cue cards', but on a $200 set the ommission is significant."
5,BSG on Blu-ray is going to rock,I hope the video quality is better than what was released on HD-DVD. This item alone may finally force me to purchase a Blu-ray player.
1,Series: 5+ stars; packing and image quality: 1 star,"The packaging is cheap, tacky and horrible. It's obvious that over time, the discs will become so scratched as to become un-playable. Also there is no book or guide of any sort. I had to go online and download a guide. The DVD quality was distractingly bad, flat and almost one dimensional.I exchanged the set for a the Blu-Ray, bought a Blu_ray player and boy what a difference! The packaging is the same but the Blu-Ray's image quality is spectacular and the extras are fantastic.And as for the series itself? Battlestar Galactica is simply the best show ever in the history of television."
1,Talk about GREED...,"a real kick in the arse to the fans who made them rich. this set should LIST at no more than $200 topsdue to economies of scale, the pro-rated all-in-one-box mfg cost savings, and the fact that these episodes are now 'old news' so to speak. Unbeleiveable"
4,Good blu-ray translation,"The series Battlestar Galactica speaks for itself, and I love it a lot. I got the Bluray edition to watch it again in its entirety. I can honestly say I was expecting the actual disc holders to be a bit better... it's four open boxes with sleeves you slide the blurays into. I wasn't impressed with that for the money.Otherwise, very happy with the quality, sound and the series."
4,the series,"it's a very good series.so,I'm going to review the set itself.a couple of the discs skip or freeze,they didn't seem to be dirty,could of been my player.the set comes with the movie ""razor"",so you don't have to buy it separately(yes ,I bought the movie when I bought the set).Here's my main gripe,season 4 starts with ""Razor"",then disc 2,3,4.there's no disc 1... disc 2 starts with ""previously on battlestar galactica"" there's couple of scenes from episodes I've never seen,and that first episode on disc 2 seems to jump forward a lot.So I really believe they left out disc 1.Someone that knows the series better than me will probably correct me on that,and that okay 'cause I'd like to know.All in all,it's a really good series"
4,"Great series, awful packaging.","Hands down one of the best series I've watched sci-fi or other. That said, the idiots who designed and approved this packaging need to be fired."
5,Early Glam Metal at its best. This is one of the best !!!!!!,Serious Rock for the Glam Crowd... Only one better and that would be Heavy Bones S/T
3,If you like Cool from the Wire,"If you like this album, ""Cool from the Wire"" seek out some of their other albums! ""Five Easy Pieces"" is my personal favorite. These guys ROCK!"
3,Nothing you haven't seen before,"The Bottom Line:A thoroughly mediocre war film that doesn't attempt to rise above the conventions of the genre, The Trench may satisfy the cravings of Great War buffs (their war being sadly underrepresented next to WWII) but if you've seen a war movie or two you're likely to be underwhelmed by this rather tired genre offering.3/4"
5,Very good introduction to the topic for EE students,"I used an earlier edition of this text in the Communications Systems course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where Prof. Carlson was, at that time, the head of the Electrical Engineering Department) and found it to be a very good book. The explanations were concise and easy-to-understand. The book explains the underlying concepts well. The mathematical tools needed for the understanding of the concepts are introduced at the appropriate times.This book is used in the EE curricula at RPI and at Stanford University (in the EE 279 Introduction to Communication Systems course) and at other schools.For an EE student at the undergraduate level, this is an excellent introduction to communication systems and should help you understand quite a variety of topics dealing with both analog and digital communications."
2,Not Ace's best work,"If this had been a three song E.P. with ""Insane,"" ""Dancin' With Danger,"" and ""The Acorn Is Spinning"" then I would have given it four stars. Unfortunately, it isn't. Tod Howarth wrote five songs on this album that easily qualify as bad hair band metal. Ace also wrote some crap here. ""Juvenile Delinquent"" is a joke and ""Separate"" would be better if it were ""separated"" from this album.Ace's 1978 solo album was great, and his Frehley's Comet debut was ... good. Ace is a very talented guitarist with a distinguished sound. Too bad you just can't find any of that here. This album was released in 1988, right in the middle of the hair band explosion. Like so many bands in that time, Frehley's Comet experimented with glam. It didn't work. The good thing is that Ace knew it and didn't make the same mistake twice. His next album ""Trouble Walkin'"" is very good."
5,Solo Portfolio,"I looked at many bags trying to find one that was flexible to handle my needs for local use and travel. This bag filled the bill nicely. It has many useful compartments, protects my 15"" Macbook Pro nicely and it is stylish and lightweight. I highly recommend it."
4,Great For Miscellany and Separation,"I used this set when my husband and I endeavored to use one giant bag for our week-long vacation. The three piece set is really two sizes, two smalls and a large, which worked well for us. Socks and unmentionables in one small for him, another for me. The larger one I eventually used to store gifts we had purchased, wrapped in t-shirts for cushion, and it was a dream.If you like a little organization in your bags, I can recommend these heartily. The mesh on all sides but the bottom breathes really well, but they are by no means super structured. They yield willingly to things pressed upon them, so keep that in mind when you're cramming ""Just one more"" pair of shoes in your suitcase."
5,Amazing product for the unorganized,"I used these in my back pack for my trip through Europe. I am a very unorganized person and without these packing cubes I would have had a mess of wrinkly clothes to deal with throughout the trip. They are flexible yet sturdy and they fit neatly into my side zippered backpack. I used the larger one for my pants, shorts, skirts etc. and in the smaller two I rolled my shirts, tank tops and summer dresses. Its so convenient to just grab what you are looking for without the hassle of sorting through everything else. The zippers were also of good quality and didnt snag. When I first purchased them online I thought they would be bigger than when I received them. But after using them, I found them to be the perfect size. They can hold a lot for their size. Highly recommended and I plan on purchasing more for longer trips with larger suitcases."
3,Lightweight but flimsy,"Everyone loves Rick Steeves, but these packing cubes do not live up to hs name. The packing cube concept is great but this set is not well-made. The zippers do not move freely and need a heavy tug. I feel to it going to break soon. On the plus side it is lightweight and you can see all your stuf inside without the need dig around."
4,Nice Product,Very nice product. Keeps things organized. Size better for shorter trips rather than 2-week trip we were on but were helpful in keeping the smaller items together and organized.
5,Great idea,While these packing cubes consume a bit more space than a roll of clothes it's really nice having your clothes separated by type into these cubes. And they are squishy enough such that a half-full cube can be jammed into small space.
1,pissed off buyer,"The worst thing I have ever bought. It didn't work from the begining.I left a couple of messages but never heard from you. Did talk with La Pavoni, they said you would take it back but nobody returned my call.I think your service sticks. I had to press one star to send this noteDave Gilber"
3,Worth the money but I was dissapointed,I really enjoyed this dvd but I bought it to see him sing The Stroke my fave Squier song but hearing him sing that sucked.There was no base to it and it just lost all the attatude that made it a great song.All in all a worthy dvd but that one thing pissed me off so.
3,i'll be honest,"...i havent read this book yet. thats why i tried to give it a rating in the middle. but, what i do know is... the first 45 pages of the book. are literally just reasons of why it was a good thing you bought the book and saying how much it's going to help you. ..wtf?"
4,Lots of stuff,"but the box seems a little flimsy, for the effort and money put into this you think they would have done a nicer package, needs more documentary stuff."
1,POOR VOLUME CONTROL,tHE VOLUME ON THIS DISC VARIES SO MUCH THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ADJUST THROUGOUT THE ENTIRE DISK..
5,Great watch,I bought this watch to wear swmming and diving and on the weekends. I have been extremely satisfied with the quality and look for this product.
4,Yellow Dial Ana-Digi Casio,"I bought this watch many years ago at a Service Merchandise chain store. Anybody remember them?I found through the years that it goes through batteries at the rate of about one a year, often less if the alarm is used. Other than that, the watch is comfortable, accurate, and it an excellent value for the money. My wife accidently threw the watch away while it was on a cluttered desktop about 2 years ago, and I replaced it with one from Wally Mart, although there it was about $75.00. The battery lasted less than a year, in fact it needs one now."
2,Too much hype?,"True, it is nice to have analog and digital. True, the watch looks nice in a rough-kinda way. However it stops there: looks. This is actually a delicate watch for its appearance. Read prev reviews and you will learn about the tendency for hands to fall off. And after you change your 1st battery you better not get any water close to it. Mine works intermittently. First I thought it was the battery, so I had it changed but to no avail, it still works when it wants to. My much cheaper Timex has needed no battery replacement after 2 years, it also has analog and digital and I have even scuba dived with it and it is still going."
3,Almost a redo,"I was so excited the watch came in quickly as promised. It was exactly want I had wanted. I already had one that had quit working from several years previous. I set the time and the watch did not keep time. The digital portion kept perfect time but, the analog portion stopped and lost time. For about a week I reset the time daily. After that first week it began to work and has not stopped since. I don't know what happened but it works perfectly now. I would have thought the battery was an issue but the read out and on the digital portion was good and it never lost time. Seems great now."
1,"power supply absolutely sucks, causes high noise in the output","The device seems to work perfectly, as long as I power it with a 12-volt battery, rather than with the power supply that came in the box. With the power supply, there is a very noticeably background hum. So this device, as supplied, does not deliver on its promise of low noise. The background hum is actually louder than the hum I had with my old cheapo Radio Shack amplifier! With my 12-volt battery, however, the device appears to meet its low-noise specifications. So, I'm using it with a battery. Serious inconvenience!Also, the phono stylus they supplied for my Shure V15 Type II cartridge doesn'tfit. A total loss. And there's no way to contact these people from their website, and by the time I got around to actually using this thing, I had lost the shipping paperwork.I'd definitely never buy from these people again."
1,Think twice before you buy these steps,"As far as entering and exiting the pool, these steps are great but they are a major pain otherwise. They float around no matter how much weight are put in them AND the algae grows inside,underneath, and around them no matter how clean you keep your pool. We also had to replace our liner after they scraped a hole in our liner leaking 30,000 gallons of water overnite! They are also fairly expensive. I continue to search for another step instead of the ladder that came with the pool....."
1,Don't Bother.,"It might have been ok for 99 cents, but certainly not any more. There is nothing in here that is not common sense, no tips or tricks, no insider information. Sorry I wasted the money."
1,Much to be desired,"After spending a lot of time trying to set up this camera myself and time with the Creative tech support I actually ended up returning the item. Turns out that the camera requires the use of Port 80, which is blocked by my ISP and, according to my ISP, is blocked by many ISPs. Tech support wasn't much help either. I had to wait at least 20 min each time I called and I felt like I got the run-around each time, with a wild goose to chase in order to get me off the phone."
4,Mejor del Chavo del 8 Vol 1 DVD,"I bought this DVD for my husband who used to watch it when he was a kid, so it brought back good funny memories for him. I coulnd't get into it too much because of the fact that it only shows you clips from different episodes,and not the full episode so you don't actualy understand everything that is going on. All in all it did make my husband laugh and I was happy about that."
1,Just not worth it.,"I purchased this DVD-audio from Amazon.com because it was grouped with the Blue Man Group DVD-audio titled ""Audio"". The BMG Audio DVD was truly a masterpiece.""Immersion"" was a piece of something else.This disc should be free and included with every new 5.1 surround system to check speaker placement. That's about all it's good for. There is some artistic quality to the music, but not much, and not enough to charge someone for the price of a real DVD.While I know Blue Man Group is not for everyone, their first DVD effort was a lot better than the compilation included in Immersion.If you want to pay a lot just to see if your speakers are connected properly, buy this DVD. If you want a speaker test program AND some great music and comedy, buy Blue Man Group's ""Audio""."
1,"Horrible DVD, not music!","This DVD lacked quality and content.There is only one track that remotely resembles music, it sounds like fast-forwarding through a jazz piece... Track 3 (White Turbulance) is 4:28 of variations of white noise! Most of the tracks are random poor quality sound effects.The disc audio quality is lacking also. The average bitrate of this Dolby Digital DVD is only 440Kbps, less than CD quality to each speaker. My other Audio-DVD titles are DTS encoded at almost 2Mbps data rate.Don't waste your time/money on this piece of trash."
2,Not a keeper,"Like other reviewers, I was excited about getting a DVD audio player and getting this disc. That excitement ended, at least with this disc, when I listened to it. As others have said -- nice demo disc that shows off the separate channels, but nothing that I would listen to a second time. This one's going on eBay tonight."
5,RECOMMENDED,"This is the most interesting DVD-Audio surround sound recording I've heard so far. Recommended for open-minded, adventurous listeners."
3,NATIVE SON,"The story was very informative and quite educationally shocking! However, there was too much preaching that was totally unnecessary. The story said it all."
4,Good book,Bought the book for class. Very interesting read. Shed some light onto that time period and the feelings people had.
1,Only if you choose to,"Although this book's setting takes place in Chicago, it really didn't appeal to me. Richard Wright's style of writing is prolonged and boring. He can be suspenseful (at times! ), but you need more than that to appreciate a book. Why does it take 430 pages to tell a story about a young man who kills two girls and rapes one? Honestly, thats the whole plot itself. Another thing is that Richard Wright tries to emphaize everything on ""white people"". White is just a color, not a race. I understand things weren't easy back then for ""blacks"", but the more we look at it that way, the more people will keep thinking of our society as racist! Now that's a problem. I also didn't appreciate all the violence inflicted onto women. I'm not even from this country and this book seemed so silly to me."
2,boring,"sure this tells us all about racism and how it affects people, but this book is so BORING... i slept 3 or 4 times trying to read it. The end is the worst, its like 40 pgs of a lawyer talking and then the State.-dont read it unless you have to"
1,Shabby version of a great novel,"I'm writing this review to comment on the digital edition, which is riddled with typos and missed punctuation, enough so that readability is impacted.If digital editions are going to be sold at only a slightly discounted price, they need to be proofed as carefully as paper editions."
3,Both Fascinating and Tedious,"The basis for the book Native Son is an excellent one, and that Bigger is not an immediately likable character makes the message of the book stronger. However, I quickly found myself bored with the overexplanatory and oversimplified style of Richard Wright. I kept accidentally rereading parts that I had already read because the events of the book just didn't stick in my mind. The pages-long argument of Max in the trial was tedious and tiresome. Although I love the idea behind this book, the way it was written kept me from being interested in it. I much prefer Ellison or Baldwin."
5,Must have!!!!,I was able to get a new perspective on teaching after reading this. I have been teaching for 12 years and this book helped me change the way I teach. We are guiding and facilitating a family of learners. This book could be the primary teacher's bible!
2,Overpriced TV episode,"While this episode is perhaps worth a 2-hour TV episode at the Unbox or iTunes price of $2 or so, it's not worth a $20 DVD. It's not a bad episode of BG, but there is nothing particularly well-written about the script or anything else that would justify the price being charged."
3,Frustrating to watch,"I felt Razor was frustrating to watch due to the enormous amount of, what I felt to be, tactical errors committed by Admiral Caine. I am not familiar with the Pegasus's FTL drive or the Raptor's FTL drives, but chances are they are not compatible with the FTL drives of civilian cruisers. What tactical advantage was there to strip the civilian ships of their FTL drives? I can understand transferring key civilian personnel to the Pegasus for mission related reasons, but due to the large number of deaths aboard Pegasus surely they could have spared the room for some of the families. Caine could have kept in tow the civilian ships capable of FTL travel much like Adama's convoy. There are other aspects of Razor that annoyed me but overall I felt it wasn't worth watching."
