5,Quite nice!,"This book helped me out in many ways. I had never quite mastered anything save drawing cats like watermelons with whiskers (my own Grumpy looks like a watermelon in a catsuit, so he's not much of a model!) or easy-peasy snakes. I'm still no master of drawing animals, but now people recognise them! Now I get, 'Nice dog!' instead of 'Um... dog?' As with all How to Draw Manga books it assumes you know which end of the pencil hits to paper, and treats you like an intelligent human being with some skills. Your end result follows the efforts you put in."
3,This is an actual journal to write in,"This is not another installment in the Lady Cottington's series, nor should it be confused with ""Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Journal (Hardcover)"". This is an actual honest-to-god journal. You know, one you write in. With blank pages. Well, the pages aren't actually blank - they are lined. And have some of the squashed fairy art/stickers from other books. Plus, out of 128 pages (according to the product info), there are only 13 pages that repeat over and over and over."
4,"Did what Linksys wouldn't, WORK!","Plug and play. No increase in speed but that's expected if you understand the technology in your environment. I tried two Linksys CM100's but neither worked (maybe my service providers fault), but this Zoom and my old no-name modem work fine. FYI - my service provider is Ygnition and I live in an apartment in DFW."
4,Zoom 5241 USB Ethernet Modem,I have had this modem for over seven years and it has preformed effortlessly. I have reached download speeds ranging from 2mgps to 5mbps. It has been a top notch piece off hardware.
5,A Must Read,"This is such an inspirational and life-changing book, and I wish everyone could read it. All the anecdotes and stories are so full of hope and promise. I love the notion that nonviolent solutions are just a matter of a lack of creativity. That's absolutely true. This book, along with Starhawk's books are my favorite books of all time. I do take issue with one thing, and that's the use of science in the book. I feel like appeals to nonviolence based on quantum mechanics and mirror neurons are not genuinely representing the science. I think it's a beautiful interpretation, but probably not scientifically accurate. But that's more of a minor sidenote than a real complaint. And even given that, the book is touching beyond words and something that should be read in every school."
3,not an introduction to The Ring,"This is absolutely the best ""highlight"" collection out there -- no others come close to the range and depth of material provided. But beware, this is not an ""introduction to The Ring"", as some claim -- the notes are skimpy, the titles of the excerpts are untranslated, there is no libretto, no description of the excerpts -- their context or meaning -- so what you have is a great summary of the works -- one that is most useful if you already know them -- something to take along with you in the car or while jogging or walking the dog to remind you of the real thing. Bear in mind that whatever the deficiencies of this collection, the others have the same faults also."
5,Authentic Sounding 20's/Early 30's; Fans Will Like This One,"The British Group, ""The Charleston Chasers,"" by virtue of the band name they have chosen, pinpoint what they are about. This, their second CD done for Stomp Off, is every bit as true to the 20's/early 30's style as their first work.Debbie Arthurs has a voice well suited for these vocals, and the band works well together. The selection of songs includes some old standbys, like the Charleston, and even a couple of newly written 20's sounding songs.My favorites are: Baby!, I Love My Baby, I'll Be A Friend with Pleasure,Just Another Day Wasted Away, and a new one, Funny Honey.You will find samplings of several 1920's styles, from hot to sweet jazz. A wise purchase."
4,A nice book to spend a couple of hours with.,"Can you imagine Merlin, Modred and Morgan in Boston or New York in the year 2200? The usual power sources have been depleted and now the world runs on magic as some run on java. Experience the adventure of Wyrdrune, Kira and a couple of other characters in a world once again full of magic and see the first experience with the dark ones after eons. Definitely a book worth reading."
4,Really liked this one,"James is not a typical Malory hero. Ok, he is handsome etc, but he is a man that made his own way in life. And Georgina is not a typical Malory heroine. She is American - and all that it brings with it. The way they are together is a joy to read. I really liked them both. And the story was swift-paced and entertaining. Well, the one thing the Malory brothers (and the heroes of this series in general) really should learn is that not everything can be solved by beating someone."
5,Still great the second time around,I absolutely love Johanna Lindsey and all of the Malory stories. I just reread this one and still love it. The writing is so smooth I just sail through these books and find myself in love with all of the characters. I recommend virtually all of Johanna Lindsey's books to any historical lover.
4,Another Malory winner !!!,"You fall for Georgina and James from the beginning of the book. The Malorys and the Andersons are so wonderful, you just want to be one of them - and for a little time you are.The chemistry between Georgina and James, and their sense of humor, endear them to you very much."
5,great brush for all hair,"I have a standard poodle and a wheaten terrier/poodle mix. The poodle has wiry hair and the mix has soft silky hair that is prone to matting. This brush works equally well on both dogs. It has cut my grooming time down in half. Since my dogs both have hair, not fur, they do not shed. I, therefore, do not know how this brush works on a dog with fur.The dogs don't seem to mind this brush as much as the one I used before, so that is a plus too. I only wish Amazon carried the small brush as a Prime item. I had to go buy one locally instead. My dogs are beautiful and not matted thanks to this brush."
5,great,great dog brush for my dog. She has very long long hair. I like the way it takes out all the loose undercoat. :)
4,"The slicker, duh duh duh...","Very nice brush - has semi flexible, thin-metal gauge wires that really pull the undercoating out from my pooch! We've gone through a number of different brushes (some lost some break) but the construction of this little guys seems sturdy enough.Great brush for getting lots of hair out on a thick coated pooch."
2,Sloppy construction,My wife borrowed a BowMaker and found it useful once she was shown how to use it. But the construction of the one she bought is bad. It's not worth the postage to send back but before it can be used the board will need to sanded to avoid splinters and each peg resized in order to fit the holes.
2,ITS CRAPulario music,"I don't like their music its just,a lot more of what we already have in latin america... S.K.A It's nothing new."
4,Mixed bag,"While the performances are variable - Maazel's Firebird and Karajan's Rite, are very good without being outstanding - others, like Markevich's Symphony, are average at best.The exceptions are Marriner's Pulchinella and Dutoit's Petrushka - which was highly acclaimed when it first appeared and is still one of the best performances available, with its glowing colours and rhythmic subtlety.At at the price it's worth getting for the Petrouchka, Pulchinella and Concerto in E flat."
3,Great,"When you get a flat, it does what you need it to do, will your tire. Easy instructions and use."
1,Blew up my Car DC Adapter,"I bought this air compressor thinking that it would save me money and time when I need to fill up air in my cars. Apparently, it blew up two of my DC adapters and I had to return it back to Amazon.I would not recommend it."
4,slime air compressor,So far it has worked well on bicycle tires which is my main reason for buying it.
1,Hose Failure in less than 6 months,This unit was fine while it lasted; but it didn't last nearly long enough.I packed hose in the unit just the same as it was when rec'd. Pour hose material in my book.
5,slime 12 v inflator,Good product. Just don't use it for truck tires. Add a few pounds to your tires and blow up inflatables
3,too environmentalist,"A bit namby-pamby on biology. Where do all those tendencies, preferences and inclinations come from?"
5,Another great one from Lightfoot,Gordon Lightfoot / Cold On The Shoulder: One thing you can count on is finding enjoyment in the voice of Gordon Lightfoot. There are a few hits on this one and the whole album is exceptional. This one is highly recommended. Five Stars.
5,Inspiring and Informative,"The gorgeous images and thought-provoking text in this fascinating examination of artists books are inspiring and informative. This book gives a creative jolt to the reader-- a must-have book for anyone with art-world interests, aspirations, or simply appreciation."
3,Good read for Elminster fans,"If you liked the other Elminster novels, you'll like this one. If you've never heard of Elminster, you'd better pass. The character development is over and El is a powerful mega-hero. Naturally, its Ed's world so he can toss around gods and major characters as much as he wants. Those of you who hate Elminster will like the few (too few) chapters where he abstains from magic use. The writing style is so-so, but it's a nice, complex plot with interesting characters. This one is about Mystra testing him to see if he's worthy of being a ""Chosen."" The end is filled with spell battles and moralizing. I'd have just spoiled it for you if the book wasn't so predictable."
1,BOOOO,it did not make any sense. It was very redundant. Every book Greenwood keeps on getting worse and worse. I do not recomend any one getting the Eliminister series.
2,I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS SO-SO AT BEST,"I'VE READ THE OTHER ELMINSTER BOOKS AND THOUGHT THEY WERE A PRETTY GOOD READ. THIS LATEST ONE HOWEVER, WAS VERY CONFUSING AT TIMES. ELMINSTER SEEMED ONLY A SHADE TO BE SPOTTED HERE AND THERE, THE VILLANS IN MY OPINION SEEMED COMPLIMENTARY. THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES OF THE STORY WERE NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINED. THE PASSAGE OF TIME OF THE STORY WAS ALSO CONFUSING. THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AND IT LEAVES ONE ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YA GOTTA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ELMINSTER IN HIS PRE-SHADOWDALE DAYS BY ALL MEANS READ THIS BOOK,BUT..... IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN INTERESTING STORY THIS ONE MAY LEAVE YOU WANTING."
3,GOOD BOOK BUT NOT EXCELLENT,I Do not want to add any spoilers so the only things that i want to write are:1. It is mysterious but the best parts of the books are these that the writer do not refer to Elminster..The Elminster's part of the book are between moderate quality to worst quality...2.It is a good book for Forgotten Realms funs but if you are not one of them then you will find it strange3.There are too many characters and not enough plot which is confusing and sometimes you will think that you missed things and story...4. Mr Greenwood is much better game designer and world creator THAN writer...thanks
1,Junk read,"Marton's effort doesn't rate as very good journalism or gossip. No historian, and not much of a pseudo intellectual, Marton offers simply a round up of some Presidential marriages without particularly keen psychological insights other than the fact that either one or other ( in the case of the Clintons, both) partners is hung up on the quest for power, and what that obsession means for the marriage. Marton should know, since she's the former wife of ABC anchor Peter Jennings and currently Richard Holbrook, what it's like to stand subordinate to a bigger presence and the subject of this book - as well as the shallow depth of the analysis and lack of original reporting - certainly (albeit poorly) reflects on her own life experience. Save for the paperback, this is definitely summer beach reading."
2,"Should work, but sloppily welded and delivered dirty","The basket is as advertised, I suppose.However, it arrived dirty; my fingers were covered with welding soot just taking it out of the box. The spot welds are pretty ugly, too - they seem solid but are very discolored and kind of sloppy, with the discoloration extending all the way across the legs. Somebody spent a lot of time cleaning up the one in the picture, if the one I got is normalShould it work for its intended purpose? Probably. But I expected better welding and at least a clean part."
3,Better Beer & How to Brew It,"This book by M.R. Reese gives a very elementary approach to homebrewing. While it supplies the reader with recipes, the book only gives detailed instructions only once. And the author expects the reader to flip back to the page [with the instructions] each time. Plus the instructions for making the brew are very standard or generic. Yet as any home brewer may well tell you that each beer with different ingredients require the brewer to alter the direction ever so slightly. Each recipe is different, requiring different instructions."
3,No instructions to unlock the transcript key on the CD Rom,"I think this is an excellent product, but I had a hard time getting the code/instructions to unlock the transcript key on the interactive CD ROM. It has been block by the program developers for student/teacher interaction, but I have been going round-and-round with the publisher, developers, and anyone who I thought could help that I am a independent consumer. Still no instructions on how to unlock the key on the CD ROM. I have been referred to my instructor, (don't have one), publisher site (not useful), and place of purchase. Have not heard from them yet. However, If you buy this CD Rom be prepared to purchase seperately the transcript key 0130139785.It just sad now I am stuck with a partially functional interactive CD ROM."
4,Not bad. Still too much fill and fluff,"Does Joyce get paid by the word? I think the last two books, I've read by this author (Prize/Masquerade) could have both been shortened by at least 100 pages each. If she could just be a bit more succinct, she might really have what it takes to become a five star author. I still say two of the greatest romance authors of ALL TIME are Judith McNaught (Whitney My Love and Until You) and Johanna Lindsey (Gentle Rogue, The Magic of You, Prisoner of My Desire, and Man of My Dreams) to name a few. I still can't quite put Joyce in their league, but she's not bad. Who doesn't love a swarthy, well hung alpha male that she cleverly writes into each and every one of her texts."
1,Not Worth The Effort,"This book was poorly written, in every way. The spelling was atrocious, some sentences were so grammatically incorrect, it was more like something one would expect from a Jr. highschooler. So if you can get past that, you then have to contend with an often unbelieveable story. The male lead, Devlin, is a cold, heartless s.o.b. His female counterpart, Virginia(from Virginia)totally lacks for self-respect. The story was way too long. I had to make myself read the whole thing. The author just keeps rehashing the same old things page after page till I found myself skipping paragraphs. It almost seemed to me that the author was just trying to fill pages rather than write an interesting story. I was greatly disappointed in this book. It had such a promising premise, but she let the story get away from her. Don't waste your time or money."
4,READ THIS BOOK,"I only wish I could use this space to go into greater detail about my true thoughts on this masterpiece. At points it is difficult to tell if the gross misspellings and poor grammar are intentionally used to convey a mindset and attitude, or the wrong copy was submitted for printing. This could be the birth of a new form of writing, a mixture of stream of thought and ignorance. great fun"
5,Just what Piano rags ought to be!,"If you are a fan of piano rags don't miss this one! I can listen to it a lot. The way David Thomas plays is not too fast or too slow. Having just the right feeling of emotional sentiment, the music is never cloying or flashy. Something for a happy yet reflective mood. Enjoy!"
2,Mis-titled,"This DVD gives a broad overview of the Pacific War starting in August 1942 with the Allied invasion of Guadalcanal all the way through to the dropping of the Atomic Bomb and Japan's surrender in 1945. Only the first half actually covers Guadalcanal. As such, the title is quite misleading. With respect to the Guadalcanal portion, much of the ""footage"" is actually taken from the documentary ""With the Marines at Tarawa"" and is clearly not Guadalcanal. The maps are very general in nature and little mention is made of the 6 sea battles surrounding Guadalcanal. (The DVD erroneously claims that there were 4 sea battles.) While the USMC did most of the fighting on Guadalcanal, the US Army also had a significant presence and almost no mention whatsoever is given. If you are looking for a more comprehensive DVD about Guadalcanal, I recommend ""Guadalcanal: Island of Death""."
5,Amazing filter,"In my humble opinion, this is by far, the most amazing envelope filter on the market. I use it on my saxophones and I couldn't be happier with its performance. It's also very easy to master and mold to your liking. Along with its ease of use, EMMA didn't cut any corners regarding its sturdiness. Once in your hand, its density and ruggedness is obvious and highly appreciated. Great buy!"
4,good product,"Good product from good manufacturer. Be carefull however, it is very strong. Take with precaution under a professional care taker. Makes you go to the bath a lot. Needs to drink a lot of water."
3,Worth the price for the photos,"The historical/technical information accompanying this photo gallery of watches is simply a sketch and will be well known to watch buffs. There is a gross error in the introduction to section II - Chronographs. The definition of a ""chronometer"" [a watch whose accuracy/reliability has been certifide by special horological labs] is mixed up with ""chronograph"" [a 'stop watch' type of movement].All of that said - the 360+ color photographs [despite the meager descriptive text] are worth the price of the book."
2,This was weak.,"I'm a huge TNG fan, but this show really didn't take off until the third season. But a some of First Season episodes were really good,like Where No One Has Gone Before, The Big Goodbye,The Battle, and Conspiracy. This episode isn't one of them. I gave it some slack for it being the first hour long show, and the actors were still not used to their characters. But still compared with the later episodes, this episode is just weak."
4,Very nice contemporary New Orleans classic jazz group.,Chris Tyle and Duke Heitger make a good 2 cornet team in the style of the old King Oliver Creole Jazz Band. Fine selection of tunes.
4,An overlooked album in the Lightfoot catalog,"Released shortly after ""If You Could Read My Mind,"" ""Summer Side of Life"" produced no hits of the caliber of that record's title song. But there are gems here, like ""10 Degrees and Getting Colder"" and ""Go My Way,"" both of which have been covered by other artists; ""Cotton Jenny,"" a fan favorite at his live shows; and the strange but haunting ""Cabaret,"" which sounds like two songs that meld into one effortless whole. However, the record's narrative masterstroke is ""Miguel,"" which, without preaching or politicizing, encapsulates the terrible dilemma of an illegal alien who finds himself in trouble with the law. ""Summer Side of Life"" is the work of a mature and gifted songwriter, and if you are a Lightfoot fan and have never heard it, you are missing a small gem in your CD collection."
2,Didn't Get It and Didn't Want To,"Listen to this carefully before deciding to keep. I returned it. My tastes run more toward Stan Richardson, and a smoother, more calmly predictable sound. So, forewarned, you may purchase."
5,Best Sitcom on TV,"The Office is by far the best sitcom on TV today. One of the greatest things about the way the characters are portrayed is the fact that five people will probably each have a different favorite character. It would probably be helpful to watch the seasons in order just to understand the development of characters and how interpersonal relationships got to where they are currently. Besides relationships (Pam and Roy, Pam and Jim, Karen and Jim, Michael and Jan, Ryan and Kelly, etc) and a few other minor plot lines, the episodes can be watched out of order, if you want."
5,My new favorite comedy show,"We started watching the office this year, in 2009 and by March we are already on season 3. It's a fantastic show! And the quality even increases over the seasons. Get. It. Now. :)"
5,the office,I love this show. It took me awhile to understand it but I laugh out loud everytime. Finally a good show on TV. I can watch this show all day long!!!
1,Sorely disappointed,"They shipped the wrong item to me three times in a row. Each time they shipped it incorrectly I followed up with an email stating the grievance. Each time the refunded my money. However, after three attempts to purchase the item, I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE ITEM."
5,The Office - Season 3,This was purchased as a gift for my husband who enjoys this TV show immensely. He is enjoying the DVDs very much.
5,That's What She Said,Michael and his crew are back in the third installment. There's plenty of fun extras like Lazy Scranton and Deleted Scenes from every episode. One of the many highlights is the bat episode directed by cult sci-fi guru Joss Whedon.
5,So funny and glad I caught it on sale!,"My sister was wanting the Office DVD series for a Christmas present. I saw on black friday that these DVD's were on sale in many big box stores, but amazon.com topped all their prices and I was able to get free 2 day shipping with my prime account. I am so happy I got these DVD's because they allow the entire family to watch a great show with the Jim/Pam characters playing off each other in situations everyone can relate to with a comedic twist. I actually purchased the whole series off of Amazon, and they all arrived in a timely manner with no difficulties.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,great comedy,"Funny show. Must be familiar with the humor they use, otherwise may find it offensive. Also, better watch the first two seasons."
5,Good Watching of Office season 3,"I am an office fan, however in Australia, we are in the middle of showing season 3. It is also shown very late on a Sunday night (10.30) and is only shown when the channel has a spare spot. This means only half the eppisodes have been shown over a period of about 4 months and there is no knowing when the next will be shown.I found the whole season 3 on Amazon and bought it. It was delivered very quickly to my Australian post office box and cost considerably less then it would if I had bought it in Australia, - even if I could get it, which I can't as they don't release it until all the episodes are shown."
5,If you liked Titan...you'll love Citizen Coors,"...Congratulations to Dan Baum for making Citizen Coors a very enjoyable read. His research is excellent and evident and his story telling is intriguing. ...The Coors family has it all: money, murder, family dissent, recovery. I found it to be much, much more than a ""business"" read (although it does give some excellent examples of different business philosophies and why they did/did not work.) I highly recommend this fascinating book.C. Roberts New Jersey"
3,CAUTION! ITS NOT THE 4x6 PAPER INK & PAPER,"The advertisement states it is the Color Ink and Paper set. When I got the item it is ink and paper LABEL set. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!! Amazon should really change the wording to LABEL SET, not PAPER SET. It is VERY MISLEADING!!!"
2,Disappointing. Only 1 of 3 discs is Mac OS X compatible!,"The packaging is very deceiving. Only one of the 3 CD's is Mac OS X compatible, Although the other 2 do launch, they launch in OS 9 emulation (classic) mode. OS X has been out for what, 5 years and they haven't upgraded all their software yet!Very disappointing"
5,Very good!,"This protector is very good and can't beat it for the price. It is pretty thick, it goes on nicely, leaving very few bubbles, and the screen looks very clear...you can't really tell it's on. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Easy to use and effective protection,"These are easy to use and provide short-term effective protection for device screens. The plastic is soft and scratches easily, but is easily replaced with a fresh piece...I find that it lasts about a month (in my pocket, exposed to my keys and other crud) before the scratches become totally obnoxious. The used plastic peels off easily, without leaving any residue behind.Incidentally, cutting these to size is simple. The backing material is printed with a grid to act as a guide. I'm straight-line impaired and can almost get it right.Note...these are packaged 12 in a plastic bag. When I last looked, they were much cheaper than the precut protectors designed for a specific cell phone."
4,Comprehensive (But smelly plastic case),"Far superior coverage of this battle than any other source material I know of. (Like ""The World At War"" ) Uses not commonly seen B&W footage of acceptable quality. It covers all aspects of the battle's preparation and development. Such as a rundown on the generals and the armament. Most importantly, it keeps referring to the strategic implications of each main event during the preparation and development of the battle. For instance; it talks about ""Lucy"" the British intelligence operation that supported this battle. And how the ally invasion of Sicily influenced Hitler's decision to terminate operation ""Citadel"". Unfortunately, the plastic case has a disgusting smell I have noted in other cheap productions. I had to throw it out immediately! This is why I gave it a 4-stars, instead of a 5-stars."
1,A piece of junk,"I bought two of these tires for my wife's bike. Both arrived with punctures already in the tubes. I went out and bought patches because I know what a hassle it is to return items bought on-line. After sealing the punctures, it turns out the valves leak. DO NOT BUY!!! These things are junk."
5,Loved this book!,"I personally loved this book! Amazing pictures, fun to do, keep you busy books! The little pocket books would be great to take with you, wherever you go! Some of the puzzles are hard, and you have to think on some of them, but overall it's a cute book!""Cassie, Age 14, Williamson, NY"
1,A big mistake.,"I thought Transform, Tonight The Stars Revolt, and the ultra rare Anyone Fr Doomsday were brilliant. (I didn't care for Mega Kung Fu Radio). This album is full of rare and unreleased material that should have stayed in the vaults. I expecte getting another modern metal album but, its mostly full of Rap Rock which I hate. Stick with the newer material."
4,Fantasy at it's Best!,Richard Corben takes an interesting storyline and brings his full skills to bear and the results are astonishing! A must for every Corben fan!
5,A stirring look into how we face death and dying,"This third book in Wilcock's series about life in a monastary is deeply moving. The story revolves around Father Peregrine and his relationship with Brother Thomas, his aide. It is an incredibly poignant portrayal of the struggle to cope with the degenerating physical and mental capacities of one we love deeply.Brother Thomas wrestles with God and his own faith as he watches his mentor and friend, once graceful, articulate, and impressive, disintegrate into an embarassing lump of humanity, stripped of dignity.Wilcock's ability to articulate the spiritual struggles of both men is unmatched, drawing the reader into the heart-wrenching questions we all ponder but are too afraid to face.This three part series is the BEST fiction I have ever read. It stirred me as deeply as Tozer and Spurgeon, but in the exciting form of a story I couldn't put down."

5,Most Interesting,"This is a great book to see where we came from and where we might be going, with great insights to life."
3,A good place to start...,"This is the first book I read when my son was diagnosed with multiple food allergies. It's a good starting point, but not the best book on the market. The author's child has a severe peanut allergy so the tips given are mainly for a severe peanut allergy. For those of us who have severe allergies and are avoiding the top 8 allergens plus additional foods - the help this book offers is limited."
2,Better resources are available.,"I wasn't very happy with this book. I found a few helpful pointers, but overall the views were sort of extreme, and some of the advice was very contrary to what physicians have told us. If anybody I knew was reading this, I'd suggest they take it with a grain of salt and get several other viewpoints as well."
4,Better than I Expected..!,"Well, I'm really liked it..the early books Expendable,Vigilant,Hunted,Ascending & Trapped..!so I was looking forward to Radiant.. and the book was better than I expected..yes! perhaps with silly ideas at times but now with an bit more than that..with the philosophy/religion/culture debate between the characters and also an few interesting civilizations..! an very good fun read..!"
3,Blimp at altitude,"Blimp seemed ok, but did not come with helium (understandable) or twosided tape (inexcusable), and hard to find battery (a real negative).so one had to go out and buy both.Then there is a big problem.....blimp does not lift off adequately at higher altitudes (like Denver, 5000ft+) at all.Turns out even the real one does not go there.So in Denver, the present for the 8 year old turned out to be a science lesson rather than a toy.Should say this when buying and also make clear what batteries are needed. An interesting downer."
3,Stop. think.,"This book does contain some nuggets of wisdom for beginners in social science, but as a student I thought it took far too long to say far too little. There are far too many examples for concepts that only need one or two examples. For example, the authors frequently littler the pages with ""Stop. Think."" as they propose several alternative hypotheses for certain observations and models. Also, the book does seem to have an suffocating liberal bias. I don't consider myself particularly conservative, but some of the ""hypothetical"" examples seem pretty off the walls (such as the suggestion that the U.S. discriminates against ethnic minorities because they have higher death rates than whites). Ideally, I would recommend skimming the book and paying attention to the conclusion, but don't get too bogged down in the details."
2,Endless Whining,"Seem cruel? Please do not take it in the harshest way. I would like to agree with a reviewer 'music fan from USA' and would like to point out 'in general' I am reviewing the remaining Lightfoot cd's with this review on each following cd. Lightfoot had struck such a thunderous stride on Summertime Dream and the ride all the way was just relentless, churning out such rich vivid landscapes, songs like 'Miguel' come to mind... and then there are albums like this. Passionless. Mixed with the hammiest recording fumblings imaginable. Vocals that seem monotone and obsolete, void of any longing. seem cruel? Well, that's how I feel. Sure there were some goodies. Shadows (3.5 stars) for instance was quite good, but even that suffered a tremendously passionless production. From Endless Wire on out Lightfoot has truly lost his way. These remaining cd's need something they never had, nuturing. Folk and music of this type cannot be manufactured on an assembly line and Endless Wire highlights that."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GORD","No one can dispute the links and ties between country and folk music. The strains are evident in so many folk songs, that it would be hard to sepearte them. However, ENDLESS WIRE leans a bit too much on the country roots in folk. IF THERE'S A REASON is almost stereotypical country. The kind of song you'd hear in a jukebox of a b-grade movie country bar. SWEET GUINEVERE, although a story, also drips with tepid, saccharin country overtones.To balance those songs out Lightfoot puts down a beautiful opening track DAYLLIGHT KATY. HANGDOG HOTEL ROOM is one of his more fun and fast-paced tracks, and DREAMLAND is a wonderful tune that seems to show the battles he had with love.It's not a rip off to buy this album, but unless you're a serious Gord fan, you probably won't love it."
1,Irrationallity personified - could it be satire?,"I am an atheist and professionally trained physical scientist who regularly uses evolutionary concepts. I've previously enjoyed Kaminer's work and writing. However, I found this book so intellectually shallow and irrational as to be offensive to my sense of fair play and the basic rules of how we establish knowledge that I could get through less than half of it. The part I finished came across as a dogmatic attack on those who disagreed with Ms. Kaminer's political views. At the point I quit reading I was grateful that I didn't have to choose between Ms. Kaminer and the Kansas Board of Education."
4,Good information,"Good information included. Was looking for more projects, but this information will be much more useful as I move forward. The resources included will help."
4,okay book,"book to help with all your projects, i would recommend getting the home depot book more geared toward the individual project you are doing"
5,Great gift!,I purchased this as a christmas gift for my brother-in-law. His kids were excited to learn chess so they could play with him. The players are made well and it is nice that every team is represented.
1,Avoid this garbage,"There is no question about it. This is the worst casino video game on the market. The reason stems from the change in ownership of the Hoyle Franchise from Sierra to Encore. Anyone who has ever bought an Encore Software casino game can testify to the fact that they are ALWAYS riddled with mathematical errors and unplayable bugs. This version is no different than anything Encore produced in the past. It is my understanding that Sierra began development of this game but Encore finished it. I bought it in the hopes that Sierra had put enough of their programming expertise into the game, but unfortunately, the game is trash. There are terrible unplayable bugs throughout the game and the game plays out in such poor quality. I tried to remedy the problem with the downloadable patch, but when that didn't work properly I uninstalled the game and threw it in the trash! Avoid this game and avoid all Encore casino products. Buy the versions of Hoyle under the name ""Sierra""."
3,Better than one star!,"This is an OK movie, not a great movie. Considering the star power one might have expected better but it's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.Frances Langford is a stunningly attractive woman and gives an excellent performance.This is the first time I've seen Ozzie Nelson outside of Ozzie and Harriet and he wasn't as good here as he was in O&H; though it was fun watching him outside that familiar role.Jack Haley from Wizard of Oz fame plays his role nicely as does Rudy Valle. Both big stars from the era.Art Linkletter doesn't show up until about the 60 minute mark of the movie. As the package blurb says Linkletter plays himself.Overall not bad. The movie is very difficult to watch because of the poor transfer; the storyline is slow moving but overll enjoyable."
4,A Small Criticism...,"First off, if you like Shearing's delicate touch, sense of swing, and tasteful musicality, you'll really enjoy this album as I do. I have two small problems with it that take away the fifth star. Firstly, although it's generally a smooth recording, as with many Telarc jazz productions, it lacks definition in the treble range. For example, the drummer's cymbals are virtually inaudible. Secondly, Mr. Shearing succumbs to the temptation to sing (croak, really) on the last track, which causes the program to end funereally.My advice would be: Buy a copy. Turn up the treble. Program out the last tune. Enjoy."
3,Shearing has a nice touch,"I like the music; Shearing has a delicate touch.When I was young, I was lucky to see him in personon the strip in Chicago.I love this unusual medley of Christmas songs.My CD, however, stalls in the middle; so I returned itfor a replacement."
3,High price and muted colors,"I thought because I was paying 30.00 for this book that it would be a hard back, big, beautiful book. Imagine my surprise when a carefully wrapped, thin, paperback book came in the mail. The story is the classical one, the art is great, except for one thing -- the pictures are not vibrant. After reading the story I decided to keep it until my two-year-old granddaughter is old enough to handle the idea that there is a giant who eats children and that thievery pays off."
5,A lyrical read,This book taught me things I did not learn in my four years at Rutgers. Taryn Sauthoff truly brings the campus to life and engages the reader through otherwise mundane topics. Her gifted prose and witty insights make the reader smile first because they can appreciate the love felt for the Rutgers community and second because they enjoy reading Ms. Sauthoff's lyrical style.A must have for any prospective student or anyone who wants to enjoy a young gifted author.
4,Great Buy!,I am very happy with this purchase. Great book.Read with my 13 year old daughter. Led to very interesting conversations.
5,Happy Customer,My book was in great condition and obviously came from the NY library so it had library stickers but the product info told me it would. It came in on time. I was very pleased.
3,Slave,Parts of this book were too graphic for me. I can't believe what women in some parts of the world have to endure. I couldn't finish it.
2,Not as good as Earth,"This book was very redundant to me. I read two of her other books first, and I thought Earth was easily the most powerful and well-written. This one just seemed like not only was it saying all the same things as her older books, it was also very repetitive information from chapter to chapter. I was pretty shocked when I saw one line in the book and became very confused because I was certain I'd already read this book--but after looking at the other books, I definitely had not read this one yet. I am almost certain there are some sentences and paragraphs that are taken word-for-word from her own previous books! If you think this is a good book and have not read Earth yet, I highly advise you get a copy of Earth."
5,"These reviewers are crazy, great great great album!","I have just about all of the Dinosaur Jr. albums. This one is my favorite by far. Everyone is hating on this cd and I don't get it. This disc is catchier then all the rest, and I guess some ppl consider that lame. But Mascis still has crazy solos, crazy drums, and beautifully somber vocals. Bug is good, Where You Been is good, this to me though is the quintessential Dino Jr album. Yes it's newer school and yes it's cleaner and catchier then their normal stuff, but it's so undeniably beautiful. I actually enjoy the cleaner guitars - don't worry there is still plenty of fuzzy solos and riffs - but this cd is their best ever despite what everyone says. It's a matter of opinion, but I know my music and I especially know bands like Dino Jr and Sonic Youth. Buy it."
2,"Half the size, half the episodes","This mini-dvd is based off the already released 'normal' DVD of the same name, only instead of packing 6 episodes like the original did you'll only get three. Included are 'Final Exam', 'Sisters', and 'Divide and Conquer', but missing are 'Forces of Nature', 'Sum of His Parts' and 'Nevermore'. It's disappointing since these were the better episodes from this collection as well.Only recommended for the novelty value of owning a mini-disc (which as these things become more common, won't be novel for long). Completists should skip this release and grab the original."
5,childrens book,Our grandson is 3+ and named Jack. He will love this! I read it and it isn't scary and the illustrations are wonderful.
3,Items missing from order,My order arrived quickly but was missing the User's Manual and the 2 recordable CD's that were supposed to be included. I emailed the company but items were never sent.
1,Very bad Item no heat,Received the item looked very nice in person. Plugged it in turned it up to max heat let it heat up and it will not even melt very small diameter flux core solder. Let it sit for another 10 min on high still wont melt the solder. Point is you get what you pay for. In this case I should have listened. Spend the extra money and buy something that will actually work.
1,WEHEW! SOMETHING NEW TO COMPLAIN ABOUT!,"What a pile of dung! Imagine, without albums such as this, there would be no radio marketing departments! This is what they put together for the kids, mainstream so called punk albums, about as valuable as a can of Odouls. This thing stinks almost as bad as Sum 141, just another reason to wish death upon radio and MTV. WAKE UP KID!"
1,not punk,"these guys are not pop punk they shouldnt even have the word punk in on how they sound there just plain out pop, those bands out there that say there punk arent there just pop, punk isnt even close to those dumb bands like blink,sum 41 and all those other POP bands,and emo what the F__k...most music is emotional but alot of bands dont say im ""emo"",if i wanted to cry id go rent sweet november or somethin like that!"
3,By Far Their Worst,"On the whole, this album is not terrible. It just is not good. The problem I have is that it seems to be a gimmick. People look at songs like ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" by the Clash as a joke, and that's how I imagine people will view Bleed American in 10 years. I think ""The Middle"" and ""Sweetness"" are fine, catchy songs, but there's just nothing to them compared to ""Claire"" and ""Robot Factory"". Anyway, the album is enjoyable for a while, but...Static Prevails is much better."
4,Surprised Me,"Here's what I expected going in: tuneful pop, a bit of street spunk and a whole lot of navelgazing, just the CD -- in other words -- where the appeal pales to anyone past a certain age. Well, I'm past most ages, but this CD -- by either name, its current eponymous one or its pre-9/11 unfortunate Bleed American -- has legs, with every one of its 11 cuts highly listenable, very hook-y indeed, and, here was the surprise, often with literate and sympathetic lyrics. I think the CD flags a bit toward the end with just two of the last four cuts, Cautioners and The Authority Song, standing up to the best of the earlier songs. But a solid five of those seven --A Praise Chorus, The Middle, If You Don't, Don't and my two personal favorites, Your House and Hear You Me -- will stay high on all my media playlists for a good while to come."
4,One of the best unknowns...,"I first heard this CD a few weeks before its release when it was being played promotionally in my local CD store. I've been anticipating it since, and certainly have not been let down by its gravitas. I've heard too many times of CDs that get better upon repeat listenings, and while this album does do that, it makes a strong enough impact the first time around to have you hooked. I personally want this group to be successful to the point that they can keep making records as good as this, but not so successful that they lose focus on the music."
3,Balls,"This record was called Bleed American. Then came September 11. Then the record was renamed Jimmy Eat World (even though they had an early EP called that already) by a panicky record company.Maybe the band and their label should have had the balls to keep their original title.On the whole this is a tepid, blanding out of the band in contrast to their earlier records. In The Middle is a great track, but otherwise it's a disappointing record. I wonder how much this is the work of the band and how much it's the heavy hand of some producer."
5,Everything You Need,"They have so many sounds, they are diverse and well versed. Their lyrics hit it and they have a great sound. I have heard their earlier albums and this one is definitely their best. If you are looking for a new band to get into, this one might be the right fit for you."
5,An Album for Every Mood,This album is the one to get to explore and express every kind of feeling that you could possibly imagine. There is a song for every mood and thought. With out a doubt the best rock band that has broken into the main stream music scene and one that I am sure is going to be around for a long time to come.
4,Old but good,"When this cd first came out I threw them off as another emo pop band and didn't bother listening to them. A few months later a girl I was seeing gave me a copy for my birthday, I was right they are just emo pop but.they do it so well. While the songs wont change your life and make you totally stop listening to all your other favorite bands you will enjoy the album.Honestly the first track on the cd is the stand out and style I wish the band would have stuck to but they want to sell records and softer poppy music is usually what sells so I guess your left wishing.The cd is worth the purchase and is one that you can listen to more than once as well as a few classic songs on the cd."
5,One of the only new albums worth buying,"Out of everything released in 2001, with a couple of exceptions, Jimmy Eat World sticks out like a sore thumb--the only good band amongst a sea of crap. This record got me into them after I heard the title track on the radio. Jim Adkins is a monster songwriter whose melodies and lyrics rank amongst some of the best. ""Bleed American,"" the title track is probably the hardest thing here, and is probably a more anthemic, tuneful song than Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" This whole album is great though, from beginning to end."
4,uptempo cuts are perfect for hiking/walking/driving,"the guy below me, Mike from Chicago, presumes to give a rundown of each song........he's just wrong about the album in general. Authority Song is awesome, so is Get It Faster, so is Sweetness. JEW's (heh) best songs are the UP-tempo ones, not the slightly corny ballads. Mike, get some cajones man! Anyways the harder stuff on this album is what makes it a very good albumn, make no mistake."
4,Long Lasting Enjoyment,"I can listen to this CD for hours on an airplane or train and it never gets borring! All the songs are great!! ""If you Don't Don't"" is my favorite out of the bunch! If you like Jimmy Eat World's singles on the radio you will LOVE this CD!"
4,Good Cd.,"An all around good cd. My favorite song is ""The Middle,"" but the others are ok. I have never bought a Jimmy Eat World Cd, but they are pretty good, if you like rock and a little punk, and maybe rap or hip hop, you will definitely like this cd, like me. Don't miss it if you can! It is very good."
1,Complete Tripe,If you enjoy TRL this one is for you. Otherwise move on and find something interesting to listen to. Jimmy and Britney would make a great pair wouldn't they?
1,one hit,I heard the one song on Bluetorch TV or something and it was real good so I bought the cd. I was disappointed when the rest of the songs were much mellower......not my cup of tea...
4,damn god emo,"i bought this cd when i was titled ""bleed american"". i decided to pick this up when i saw the video for ""the middle"" on mtv2. i was immeadiatly hooked. i found most of the songs good and singable. the best songs are by far the beginning ones.The 5 best are:1. the middle ~ such a great song2. get it faster ~ hey, it's true3. sweetness ~ such a fan favorite4. a praise chorus ~ a good song, shows a softer side5. bleed american ~ a really cool punky emo songthere u have it, long live JEW! second best cd, next to ""Clarity"""
5,Would you quite with 'EMO',"...now lets get to the review. i love this cd, one reason is it addresses punk rock, pop, rock, and alright 'EMO' at a great extent. i have to give these guys credit, they are a true hard rock band in a world where thats hard to find; add with that great songwriting and you have a terrific mix.so buy this album for the music, and ONLY because of the music."
4,I Like This Group,"This group isn't very well known, but they are awesome and they've been around a while."
3,Lean Cuisine,"A cookbook that's a pleasure to read, but a little light on content. Thus, it's filled out with recipes that are repeditive, although it's possible that this accurately reflects the author's focus on Arab/Sicilian cuisine. There's definitely more heavenly food in Sicily than there is in this oookbook."
4,The Thyroid Soluntion,"Good Book, very informative. I had read about it in Prevention magazine and wanted to know more. Read it and learn more about your body and the function our thyroid plays in so many aspects of its ""workings""."
5,Very helpful,I have hypothyroid and have found this book to be a helpful resource to which I refer frequently.
3,Good Book,This is a really good book but I found it a little hard to read and I enjoy reading medical books. I do like that it's entirely about the mental aspect of thryoid disease unlike most other books that just explain all the symptoms in a basic way. This devles into so much about depression and anxiety and the changes relative to your thyroid hormones. I was shocked how much the two relate to each other and was happy to know I'm not crazy...it's my thyroid! :)
4,Dr. Arem found my thyroid cancer,This book is a helpful overview of thyroid functioning.Dr. Arem discovered a cancerous nodule on my thyroid during an examination. He knows what he is talking about.
3,The Thyroid Solution,The book covers a lot of information. It is not as easy to follow as I would have liked it to be. It will take more time than I was interested in spending to get through it but the information seems helpful once you get to it.
3,"This toy is for an 18 inch doll, not a little girl.","This toy is sized for an 18 inch doll, not a little girl. The size is wrong on the product description. Look at the related ovenHotpoint Electronic Toy Stove Cookerand you'll see a closer approximation to this toy's dimensions.This is a really fun toy. I got it for a little girl for christmas and I wanted to play with it! Both she and her sister really enjoy it. They are 4 and 6."
3,Not bad....but still kind of disappointed,"This CD is the low point in the musical career of the RHCP's. This CD was just completed after a major change in the band from a viewpoint of band members coming and leaving and their own personal dilemma's. Success and the price of fame was the cause of all the band's issues and this is reflected in this CD. The second track Aeroplane, My Friends and Transcending are the pick of all tracks. The other tracks go all over the place and at times its a dissuasion of noise.I give it 3 stars because of being a die hard fan of RHCP's and my devotion to the quality songs that have come out from this band."
4,IT'S PRETTY GOOD,"While not quite as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, this album is still worth getting. The songs ""Aeroplane"" and ""My Friends"" are excellent, but there are other tracks that I would skip if I had the opportunity."
4,They still red hot !,I bought this cd 2 months ago and I also bought BSSM (their BEST CD!) But this cd is also very good I'm listening to it right now. There are some songs on here which are very good and you can sing to and some which are worth a listen but not anything like some of the other songs on this cd .Like Aeroplane which is the best song by the Chili's. It one of song that make this cd memorable . Also this cd has some language in it but not enough to get a Explicit Lyrics Label. If you are looking to start your Chili Peppers Cd start with Mother's Milk then buy BloodSugarSexMagic then OneHotMinute and finally there new cd Californication .Finally go see them live they're great!
3,"Flea rocks, but what is Navarro doing?",Flea is the best bass player in the world. Just listen to Aeroplane or Coffee Shop. But Navarro spoils it all. Listen to BSSM for the right peppers sound.
5,"Different, but Good...no wait, it's GREAT!!","This Album was a different turn for the Peppers. But I believe it was an important one. This CD is by far the bands darkest, but with good reason. At the time John Frusciante was about to die, from his battle with herione and the rest of the boys were having trouble getting adjusted to the new guitarist. Dave Navarro did a great job though, he stepped up to bat, and in my mind hit a home run. The great thing about this album is how it fits in with the rest of Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog. Their albums are almost biographical. You can tell what the band is going through with each different album, even from their very first one. This was a landmark step for them in their evolution as a band. If your a fan, you should appreciate this album (regardless of the fact that they had a new guitarist) but if your not a fan, this album may be a little too experimental for you."
3,"Not their best work, I'll admit it.","This CD has its up's and down's, I'll admit it. Dave Nevarro's guitar playing never really ties in, as he's from the similar-sounding (but not enough so to fit in with RHCP) alt-metal band Jane's Addiction. ""Warped"" has a good intro, but gets tired quickly. ""Aeroplane,"" ""My Friends"", and ""Shallow Be Thy Game"" are all decent songs, but nothing here is fresh or ingenuitive enough to spark a purchase from anyone but hardcore fans. Oh, and ""Coffee Shop"" just blows completely; Flea's bass solo is the only thing that keeps it from destroying your ears."
4,Ok enough bitching,"I see all this bitching about this album...but if you think about it this album was just a rough time in all of the member's lives. It's definitely different from Blood Sugar Sex Magic, but there will never be an Album like that ever again. It sucks that John's not in the group because he's got to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, but with out this time in their lives there could possibly not be Chili Peppers around, and I, for one, would not be able to live in a world where the Red Hot Chili Peppers did not exsist. Rock on!"
2,Quite disappointed,"I am not at all happy with what we received, based on what we ordered. We ordered the ""Galt Premium Wood Baby Walker"" with ""real rubber tread tires to prevent slipping."" Along with the handle feature and the wooden body, what we MOST were interested in were the tires.However, what was sent has wooden wheels with a thin sliver of rubber running around the circumference of the wheel, and it doesn't even cover the wheel. This is not the durable product that was advertised.If you want what is advertised in the picture and on the description, DO NOT buy this. I may retract this review if Little Wonders can make this order correct."
1,CHEAPLY DONE - IGNORANT CREATORS,I am VERY disappointed with Jumpstart Kindergarten Classic. There are not enough activities for the children to do. The activities they can choose are difficult to figure out how to do.
3,Save Your Money,"I Love Lucy is quite possibly my favorite television show of all time. I had orginally bought all of the seasons when they were released not noticing that the first season was close to twice the price of the following season. This box set is bulky and only contains four episodes a disc. I would save you money and buy the reformatted I Love Lucy season one, being released soon. In this edition there will be six episodes to a disc and will fit in nicely with the rest of your collection."
5,Fantastic!!,"My son and I enjoy watching I Love Lucy!! He's 10 years old and he's hooked up on it!!I bought seasons 1 and 2 and also considering buying seasons 3 and 4.The DVDs are fabulous and also have many other features such as deleted scenes, songs, and much much more.I actually received the product before the expected delivery date!! It is a great purchase. Very satisfied."
4,FIRST SEASON HAS FLAWS!,"So far I have watched 4 DVDs out of the set. On disc 4 there is an episode of My Favorite Husband entiltled ""Valentine's Day""; at the end of this episode, we lose the audio for about 2 minutes thinking there is no more data and then we hear the remaining dialogue that is also cut off; someone messed up badly on this one. Also, the audio is different on every episode. I needed to adjust the volume very frequently. In general, the quality is excellent, but I am a somewhat disappointed. I am very eager to know if others noticed the audio problems mentioned above or any other flaws. Hope this was helpful."
5,Glad I kept it for myself,"I actually bought the first year of I Love Lucy for my 20 year old who LOVES Lucy, not knowing her boyfriend had already bought it. Talked it over with my husband and we kept it for ourselves. We have been watching it and can't stop laughing. I forgot some of the funny things Lucy has done. I bought second year for my daughter and am thinking about getting it for myself."
1,New Version...TERRIBLE quality,"The series speaks for itself...one of the best television shows EVER. However the new re-packaging of the series has issues. My first copy of Season One had three of the 6 discs scratched. My second copy had the Spanish subtitles go on randomly. I'm on my thrird set, hopefully no problems."
5,OMGOSH!,THANK GOD! I have been putting off buying the first I Love Lucy Season 1; mainly because of the price. Thank goodness they're rereleasing it! And WAY cheaper too!
1,4 stars I pushed the wrong button,More reasonable and well restored. It's still too high and should be the same price as Gilligan's Island so it loses a star. But My Favorite Husband is a great easter egg. Watching one after the other after the explosing of realistic TV and seeing real versions of the sit-com does detract. But then again I have the classic moments Lucy book that is made to be a very fun toilet read and when you focus on the great stuff the show is still the gold standard for the sit-com.
5,I love lucy the complete first season,What about everyone who has purchased disk 1 -8 will they be releasing a disk 9 so that we do not have to purchase the hole set again to get the one disk we do not have?
2,Unrealistic portrayal,"While I enjoy the Dear America written series, I did not like this adaptation. I bought it to show to my 8th grade Social Studies classes but thought it would give them an unrealistic picture of how immigrants lived. The main character was supposed to be a poor Russian immigrant girl but she lived in accommodations that are perhaps better than some of my students'!"
4,"Excellent results, but hard to clean!",Does a great job with polarizing and color. But it sure is hard to clean once any finger oil or any other kind gets on it.
3,Hoya Moose warmifying filter,Hoya Moose 58mm Warm Circular Polarizer Glass FilterThis filter gets fantastic results when shooting people near rocky background or water.
4,20th century sex review,"Five Stars...This is an excellent history of sex in America in the 20th century. It has a substantial review of censorship and its opposition through the century. The importance of sex researchers and sex philosophers is well documented. The influence of war, movies and stars on sexual change are enthralling. A fine addition to our library of sexual reference"
5,I LOVE these books,"My mother's hometown is the real Deep Valley, and I have loved these books for as long as I can remember. My grandmother and I spent a summer vaction tirelessly hunting down out of print, hardcover copies of all the high school books. They were, and remain, my very favorite young adult literature. I read them over and over because the invoke memories of a less frenzied time. I strongly recommend them for anyone."
4,A great book for people of any age,"i am a 14 year old from chicogo and i got really into all of the betsy-tacy books. i read them all three times. i'm not kidding, they were that good. i think that maud hart lovelace has created a series of masterpieces that are perfect for any girl who loves to laugh, and even cry, over a good book."
5,"A delicious experience, full of grace, charm, and humor",Betsy and Joe finally come together . . . and even then things don't always go smoothly! Full of tendeness and humor. Deep Valley at its best.
4,Review,I'm an amateur cook. This book helped me with terminology and also with techniques that made my work easier.
4,Not as good as it could be,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It is good for descriptions, but the pictures are a little small, fuzzy, and black & white for my taste. It isn't much of a cookbook of course, but instead is a step by step guide for various techniques. Nevertheless, I turn to real cookbooks for recipes, and haven't used this much. Somehow I dont use it as much as I would think I should."
1,A Very Poor Product,I bought this item for my son thinking it was going to be so worth the money. When i got it however i was sorely dissapointed. The item is made cheap and all of the pieces just pop off at random. My son can't really even get five minutes play without something coming apart.
4,Picture is not what you get,"My one year old (yes, I know, this is for kids over 3 - whatever!) absolutely LOVES the vacuum cleaner - mine and his. I have a DYSON and now he has his own. He doesn't even turn it on - he just joins me daily as I vacuum. I'm sure that the suction wouldn't be much, so don't buy it for that and if color/appearance is important to you, don't count on getting a purple and green vacuum like the picture - It will be obnoxious red and yellow and purple. However, my boy has me vacuuming at least twice a day and I have an immaculate house with a one year old !!! My friends don't believe it!! :)"
2,try the real ones,"Though I like very much Eric Clapton here the only thing he does is to have some fun with his group. There is nothing new, neither the arrangements, and he sings like a frog. The best thing one can do is to follow the clue of the originals and take 'em home!Sometimes Clapton play a pretty good fine blues, but here's not the case, so I say the same that Clayton Littlejohn: try the real ones"
2,Lacks Soul,"This, like many EC Cds after 1978, lacks a soul...I think that Backless was that last great EC CD (excluding Journeyman) and Eric should focus back on his passion more than his speed....Get either ""Blues"", ""Crossroads 2"", or ""EC WAS HERE"" for some great EC blues stuff."
2,What a sham. What a shame...,"E'C's love off the blues is obvious. And his willingness to ""tribute"" the originators is commendable. But these ""faithful"" renditions do not offer anything new aside from modern production. What is most troubling is that middle american ""white"" folks are treating this as though it's a work of genius. Does E.C. make blues ""safe for white people?"" It's a sad commentary on Clapton's audience. If you go to the source(s) you will discover that there is no substitute for the real thing. E.C. has no soul. His versions are stiff, stuffy and tight sphincter by comparison. If you must have your blues served up by a white guy. Try Robben Ford, Ronnie Earl or Paul Rishell. Or better yet, If you like the old classics go to the originals. E.C. is a bore."
4,"Great Guitar, Rough Vocals","This is a fantastic album for fans of Clapton the bluesman or Clapton the guitarist. He unleahes fiery guitar solos in ""Five Long Years"" and ""Groaning the Blues."" The only reason that this album is not a classic is that Clapton's singing is subpar, but his guitar playing makes up for his singing. If you're a Clapton fan from the Bluesbreakers and Cream days this album is for you, but if you're looking for albums like ""Slowhand"" or ""Unplugged"" you might want to skip this one."
4,Well worth your time,"I have to agree with some of the critics -- Clapton does an excellent job and his technical skills shine in this album, but the vocals do seem a bit forced. However, this was the first blues album I ever owned, and I was hooked on blues from the first time I ever played it, years ago. I still listen to it regularly. The primary virtues of this album are (a) better insight into Eric Clapton himself, and (b) an ideal introduction to the glory of blues music for those who haven't been exposed to it before. Like I said, I now own a collection of blues music by ""authentic"" blues masters, but I still enjoy listening to Cradle. You won't be disappointed. His guitar work rocks."
3,"An homage, a well-played exercise.","Like ""Malted Milk"" on Unplugged, Clapton here is copying, almost note for note, blues greats. There it was Robert Johnson. Now it's mainly Freddie King. The beauty of the blues is that evryone has covered everything - but always in their own way. I don't see any of Eric Clapton here. In truth, this wasthe first blues album I ever bought. It was my entre into the works of B.B., Freddie and Albert King, Muddy Waters, the Wolf, and earlier acoustic pioneers. But this album isn't The Blues. It's a tribute to the Blues."
4,Eric at his best doing covers,"A good blues album, but is this entirely EC. It seems he's back doing the covers again. EC is a great guitarist but I can't help feeling he's lost some of that creative talent. I'm a great fan of his earlier albums 461 Ocean Boulevard and Slowhand but even then he was doing covers. I can't help feeling that EC gets a lot more credit than is due. It's his best blues album of recent times, but I'm sure he could produce some original material."
4,Awesome guitar,"I just recently got into the blues, but I had already heard of Eric Clapton. When I got this CD I was wowed again by his awesomeness on the guitar. He is the best in my book. I can't wait to hear more of his stuff in the future."
4,Rugby Rob Review,"Rugby Rob is a good book about the college years of student who felt he didn't fit in.....until he found Rugby! Robert Kanzig's unique humor comes through throughout the entire book and is very interesting. Not knowing much about Rugby, I did learn about the game from the book. Besides Rugby, the story line did include a romantic interest. I enjoyed Kanzig's book and look forward to reading more of his novels. His wit in combination with his outlook on life is unique and entertaining!"
4,Treason never prospers...wrong,"I have only received this book a couple of days ago. However it's an excellent read. The writer clearly doesn't like his subjects, but he does St John Philby justice so far. Kim has only just entered the story.I would normally not review a book at this stage, but l have waited along time to receive it, and l have got stuck in, because both Philbys' are of interest to me in the work l am doing.I would recommend it to readers interested in the 20th century British politics and in particular foreign policy, and to recruiters because this pair give a new meaning to the word disloyalty...and how to damage a benign host..in this case Britain. Plus a master class in how to cover up their nefarious activities while despoiling the country's interests in favor of it's rivals and enemies."
2,Nikon D5100 Autofocus does not work with Filter,"This is more of a warning than a review, but if you own a Nikon camera, the auto focus may not work. I tried using this filter with a polarizing filter and by itself, and camera could not focus in the auto-focus mode at distances from 3 feet to long distance and the camera would not take a picture. Then I removed the filter and the camera worked perfectly--same result with Circular Polarizing filter (CPL). You can use this filter in the manual focus mode and it works fine, but I like personally the results better when just using a CPL."
3,pic this album up if u are a prophet posse fan!!!,"i liked this album, there is some songs that are ok but most of them are tight!!! i remember when i first got this cd i was always jamming out to ""Fly Straight"" and will a n.... make it brings me back in the days when i was in high school. dj paul and juicy j's beatz are always good. So if u are a fan of the old prophet posse and 3 6 u need to buy it!!"
3,gets worse over time!,"As a huge queen fan I orginally thought this was a great listen, but over time only a few moments still are enjoyable. My highlights are ""let there be drums"" ""last horizon"" and when they had freddie on the big screen on ""bo rhap"" a few other good moments are mixed in with plenty of boring rubbish. For real queen pick up ""live at the bowl."""
1,Save your money for something better,"A relative bought this dvd for me a while ago, and it went straight back into the store. I was expecting more out of this, i thought i'd give it a try, the magic that Queen once had is gone, obviously. To me this dvd was just a regular concert and nothing special. The songs that Paul Rodgers sang, weren't fit for his vocal range, although Brians guitar was great on some songs, otherwise this concert was just a mess"
3,Beware DTS only,I think this is a decent concert but was very dissappointed the 5.1 is in DTS only. I think it's poor that this is not disclosed on the website.
4,Harder then I thought,"Great,lively show, very tight Paul does a great job with the songs and dosnt try at all to be Freddie ( Rapsody ) is sung by Freddie via the Jumbotron with the music live.The Guitar player rocks! I mean really much much heavier then I would have guessed.Sound is ok, not a WOW demo disc, but a great show nonetheless"
2,Not Bad,"This is not a horrible DVD, but Paul and queen are not the greatest mix in the world. We got some highlights here, but a lot of these songs sound like a imitation of the real thing. Soon queen and paul will once again go their seperate ways and what they did will be basically forgotten in a ""flash."""
5,Wow,I dropped this CD in a car with an Infinity stereo and Wow! I heard Sea Level years ago but it didn't sound near this good. The digital remastering of the original recordings really brings this music to life. For those of you who like complicated jazz rhythms you should check this out. I personally don't know of any other music like Sea Level. It has a touch of Allman Brothers with jazz like Sting used to use. For me now I have to buy the rest of the remastered recordings.
2,Would not buy if I had it to do over,"Lots of great pictures of the newer stuff (1964 and on), but only a list in the back of the great old stuff with no pictures. Not recommended for the serious collector who likes the wonderful old wood toys and needs/wants a pictoral reference."
5,Great reference book!,This is one of the best books for little people and other FP toys. Also a great wish book. One of the best for identifying your toys. I would recommend it highly!
4,Good Book,It is a good book for the identification of some of the different toys sets. The larger pictures are helpful.
4,Very relevant,"I like this book a lot. It describes the 4 main personality types that people fall into and how many miscommunications occur if we're unaware of how to deal with those personality types. It also focusses on the fact that some people are incompatible but that doesn't mean they can't be in a relationship together. Nowadays, too many people walk away from a relationship as soon as things get difficult - this book shows you that we may have different personality traits and how to compromise and accommodate those traits. I like that it shows you that it's not anyone's fault, we just have to try a little harder before giving up. I'm not into religion and the author is so there are smatterings of that throughout but I didn't find that annoying. I really like her other book, Personality Plus too. I found it very helpful in my relationships with different types of people in all walks of life."
2,"Rickover Unauthorized Biography - Lots of Interesting Details, but Overlong","Worth reading if this is your area. The book describes Rickover as dominating, selfish, obsessed, power-hungry, dictatorial - but of immense value to our country because of the way he directed his ambitions. Interesting: How he exploited Congressmen to support him; how his superiors and peers despised him, yet envied his brilliance, how he interviewed and selected staff. Not interesting: Endless details on appropriations; differences between various sub propulsion designs. The book is solid and well-written, but unless you are interested in this arcane area, you can find more interesting biographies. And beware: Because this was unauthorized, Rickover and his staff did not participate and many of the inputs from others are of the vicious, jealous type, so the whole man does not come through in this book very well."
3,OK,"This is a decent fun loving rock album, but doesn't approach the lyrics, rhythms, or breadth of styles found on later albums. Get it if you think you're die hard, otherwise refrain."
3,More dress up than puzzle,"I was a little disappointed with this puzzle. I didn't realize that only the princesses (head, torso, and skirt) and flowers at their feet were the puzzle pieces. So, this ""puzzle"" is more about changing around the colors of the dresses and flowers than learning how to fit puzzle pieces together."
1,This is not a Shure approved reseller - no warranty!,"Had a small problem with my headset. Sent it to Shure to get it replaced and Shure called me to tell me that this was not a Shure-approved reseller, and that they won't honor the warranty because of that. Be warned!"
4,Great Sound IF you can find the right fit,"I purchased my pair and received them this past Monday, after using them for a day I came to the conclusion that they did not work for me and needed to be returned.I have read other reviews on this product and tend to agree with all the plus and minus mentioned by others on this and other internet sites.These can produce great sound IF you have the right ears for them, I had to stick them way down in my ear to get good bass from them, my ears still ache a little (just a day later) from TRYING to find the right fit to enjoy music coming from my IPOD, I tried all sizes supplied by SHURE and there is ample sizes and variants but nothing worked FOR ME.If you have some question as to if this product is the one for you I would suggest taking a chance and adding them to your online cart, but like me make sure you have an easy way to return them should you not find your correct fit.Also, if you hate ear buds you'll probably hate these from the start."
4,Needs more bass,"Have had these buds for a couple ears now. The sound is very clear but lacks some bass. Had a chance to try out some e530's, which put these to shame (expected given the price differential).I had to send back my original pair b/c of a fraying wire. Shure has some unbelievable customer service. They sent me a new pair immediately after receiving my old ones."
3,Comfortable and good sound...but bad quality...,"ok, so I got a pair of these in Feb 2009, they almost last a year...almost. The left ear bud just died out one day.No problem shure has a 1 year full warranty on all products right? Sure enough..took a while but they sent me another pair. These lasted about 4 months if even and again left ear bud started cutting out. now a month in Im still waiting for another replacement pair.These are possibly the most comfortable ear buds once you get used to them. The highs and mids are great. The bass is there...but it's nothing to write home about.The biggest issue with these is the build quality, I;d expect them to last at least a full year and a half/2 years if not longer for the price.Honestly you can get skull candy inked buds for 10-15$ if you know where to look and they wil have more bass. Yes skul candy is HORRIBLE quality...don't expect them to last more than 6-9 months...but it;s not like shures last you much longer...Save the money get something else."
3,Good quality but color mis-match,"I purchased these floor mats for my husband's Jeep for Christmas. Overall we are pleased with the quality and the fit, but the color did not match the picture on the website. The ""charcoal gray"" color is much darker than pictured. We will keep the item since the color matches other parts of the Jeep's interior and it would be a pain in the neck to return the large shipment, but be careful when ordering this item!"
2,Slightly below average,"EMI has put out some really fine recording as part of their ""Red Line"" series. This isn't one of the better ones. While Gavrilov has all the talent to pull these works off, he isn't helped by poor sound quality. The orchestra sounds unclear and some of the piano passages are muffled. The opening movement is taken at a quick pace (about the same as Rachmaninov himself on RCA), but the second movement really slows to a crawl and Gavrilov almost seems too deliberate. The sense of flow is lost. I don't get the sense that Muti and the Philadelphians are really that involved or that they even care a great deal. The Rhapsody comes off better, more together, but it is almost a consolation prize. On the other hand, perhaps you get what you pay for in this case. There are other excellent Rach 2's at mid price including Ashkenazy/Previn on Decca, Van Cliburn/Reiner on RCA, and Richter/Wistocki on DG, and for a budget price there is a fine performance by Rubinstein/Reiner on RCA."
5,Nosso Lar,"I actually bought an (English translation) of this book while traveling in Brazil. It is one of the best books on the subject I have read in a long long time. It clearly describes an incredible and believable place/space a not-very-awake soul goes through after death. Told as a story, rather than a channeling, I felt the concepts and ideas introduced were very accurate. Even though some of the ideas are now considered a little old-fashioned, most of what is said is absolutely true, as I have seen and experienced it as a spiritual (psychic) counselor. I put five stars on this book since I couldn't put it down for a brief rest while reading it!"
3,A Holy Land connection,"I purchased this book hoping to get historical information that helped connect biblical records to world history specifically the time of Alexander the great, the 300 Spartans. At the time I did not comperhend the title Hoplite!So this really was not a help in what I was looking for"
5,Great for a picky eater,"My picky guy, a Mississippi River Map Turtle, would not eat. He likes to dig up his own food on the bottom of the tank, so he won't go for anything that floats. These sink down into the river rock at the bottom of his tank. The color and smell attract him immediately and he digs them right up and eats. I was worried about him not eating, but these did the trick for him."
5,A Good Christmas Present,I bought this for my grandparents for christmas because i know they like to look at older documentaries and movies but I didn't know exactly which ones to get them. I have to say I'm glad I did because they immediatly ordered several World War II DVDs and they seem very happy with what they got.
4,fit perfect,Has been a great tire for our jogging stroller.has held air better than the big box store inner tube.and the price from amazon was better.
3,Slime Smart Bicycle Tube,Received on time and the right product. I punctured the tube and I'm not sure if I accidently did something wrong or the tube was easily punctured. So I can't give you a review because I was not able to use the product.
2,Grass,I purchased because I had bare spots in my yard and it had good reviews. The seeds come up very quickly as described. The grass died so I still have bare spots.
1,do not buy from this vendor,this is false advertising - this is not a set of 6 but just one bowl - do not buy from this company - based on the fact that they are willingly giving out false information - this is not 87% off retail - this is not 6 pounds to ship - this is not a set of 6
2,not so good,"The book was in good condition, however it was filled with writing and I felt a bit cheated. I made three orders in the same day and this order took almost a week longer to arrive."
3,probably the best season,"I agree with the last reviewer that this was clearly the best season of Mad TV. Maybe because the show was new then, I really don't know why. But the skits seemed more funny than later years, maybe they had different writers.As the last reviewer also said, this was a season where we saw some mock movie trailers where they mixed two programs together. One example in this first season was their film - Blades. A mixture of the Wesley Snipes movie 'Blade' and the Billy Bob Thorton movie 'Sling Blade'. I thought it was so hilarious when I first saw it, and I still do. At one point in the trailer the Sling Blade guy says, ""Yep...ate me a vampire once. Sucker taste like corn."" And while Blade was fighting off vampires, the Sling Blade guy stood there eating fries, or as his character said: French Fried Potatoes."
4,This is a very funny show,"INTRODUCTIONI love MADtv. It is so funny. I cant wait to watch it. If you can tell i am refering to the newer seasons. Dont get me wrong, this is a great set. The only problem is that there arn't many funny skits. Most of them are wierd and annoying.SUMMARYNow to the positive side...In this 3 double sided disc set there are 19 hilarious episodes plus the 200th episode reunited the first seasons cast. There are a lot of funny special features too. This season has many animated shorts too, like the SPY vs. SPY and others i dont know the names.sorry. but the are pretty funny.CONCLUSIONThe first season of MADtv overall is great, but a few weak spots. It is well worth your money though. I cant wait for the other seasons to be released"
1,TITANIUM???,This item does not weigh over a pound as stated and that may be because it is the cheapest plastic you can imagine not titanium as stated in the ad. I paid over $8 with shipping for this scoop that probably won't last a week. What a rip off. I am on an AB in Turkey and scoops are impossible to find. Beware of this misleading ad.
1,Do not buy this,I rented this to learn about Puerto Rico for an upcoming trip. It was like a filmstrip from when I was in middle school. The footage was grainy and looked as if it was filmed in the early 1980's. It is horribly out of date. I cannot recommend this.
3,yes and no,"overall, it was a pretty good book. I loved it..and i co uldn't put it down..and then it got to the end. I hated the ending. it didn't give you anything. it gave you no closure whatsoever. it left you wondering.and that would be okay if there was like..a sequel or something. but you have no idea what happens to michael. you have no idea if he's dead, alive, kidnapped, ran away. and that upset me. i wanted them to find out SOMETHING. i was just very disapointed with the ending."
5,A real page turner...,"A real page turner, I couldn't put it down. Harrar weaves an intricate web in ""The Spinning Man"" that is both fascinating and unnerving. Beware Professor Birch - he's one mighty strange and mysterious character, from beginning to end!"
4,Actually 4.5/5,"Im an 40 + yr old guy who prefers ""newer"" Weasel stuff...this one is great if just for the following 5 songs:Acknowledge,Sidewalk Warrior,Static,Let Go and Last Night...the rest all above average tunes just a tad inferior to the 5 awesome listed tunes."
3,Not as bad as people say,"This is not SW best album by no way but it seems like a reflective album that it takes some time to get into. i think after a few listens you'll undertsand what Ben weasel was trying to do. best songs:"" acknowledge"", ""sidewalk warrior"", ""static"" and ""bark like a dog"""
4,Useful for Outdoor Portraits,I bought this to reduce my shutter speed with the lens wide open while synching with my speedlight in outdoor portraits. It works as intended.
4,Would appeal to Civil War and 19th Century Maritime fans..,"With an ill-equiped crew and ship the South brought havoc and ruin to the Union's maritime fleet, in particular the whaling fleets. So if you are a Civil War buff, 19th Century maritime fan or intrigued with the history of whaling this is very worthwhile. The intriguing issue here is the fact that the Shennandoah was fighting long, long after the official end of the war."
5,I like the BASS that shakes the huuse,"It is a Great CD, it has just the right kind of music to kick back and lissen to, or tun it up and shake the house."
3,kindle book,"Not a book I would recommend for children. Very wordy, but a nice account of the Greek Tales. My niece was disappointed she was looking for a on her own book."
1,CHEFS STAY AWAY!,"DO NOT buy this roaster if you are at all serious about cooking. It warped immediately in my 500 degree oven, the high temperature I used to start my Thanksgiving turkey. Also completely useless over two burners to make gravy--everything immediately burned, it has major hot spots, and horrible heat conduction. The bottom is, as another stated, like tinfoil. I was very surprised at the poor quality, being so happy with other Cuisinart bakeware I have purchased. It is a waste of money and I am currently requesting a refund from Amazon or Cuisinart. Wish me luck."
4,Very pretty roasting pan & impressive gift,"If you have a good cook (or chef) in the family, this makes a very impressive gift. It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.My only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior. You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards. The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean. But it's worth the effort - the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.Worth the money.Watch out for the handles when they're hot - they don't fold down and it's easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you're moving it around while hot."
4,Touching grief,"For anyone who understands the depth of their own personal grief, this cd helps you remember. But, surprisingly, it is also empowering to remember the universality of grief. Both track 1, with the two surviving Gibb Brothers and the track 3, the melding of the children's voices, were powerful and touching. The orchestal version on track 2 was only okay.I'm glad that I have this in my collection. I wish the recordings were longer, though."
3,just okay,"I have these in several colors.......... these are not a ""first"" they are definately seconds. okay for knocking around but not for dress."
4,Great!,"The Goo Goo Dolls Rock! My fav song is ""Long Way Down"" and ""Name"". The oly reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is thet it just isn't as great as Dizzy Up the Girl!! Other than that, I loved it!"
2,I bought what amounts to a very expensive single.,"I bought this album because I liked ""Name."" Unfortunately, it turns out that that is the ONLY song I like on the album. The rest of the songs are extremely forgettable.This seems to be one of those bands that will be only worth buying when a ""Best of the 'Dolls"" CD comes out."
4,"Iris,Name,Slide,are my favorites of all.","These songs tell a story. They are my very favorite songs because they touch my heart.Music is very special to me and when a song makes me feel like these do,they are part of me. .."
5,A Must For Anyone,"As a true Goohead, it's hard for me to say which album is the best. However, this one definitely is a contender. If you liked Dizzy Up the Girl, you'll love this album. I'll be honest, just like any every other GGD album, half of it sucks b/c Robbie Takac is singing. But the songs Rzeznik does make it worth the purchase (& the 5 stars) This album is hot, & you will be pumped when its over."
1,"One ""Name"" + 12 lame","How about a cross between the Hooters and Guns and Roses at their worst? Bought the album because of the catchy and thoughtful ""Name"". The rest of the album is all over the place. Some of the songs sound identical, some are trying to be punk, some are trying to be GNR (why?), sounds like a different vocalist on every song. The lyrics and guitar riffs seem generic and recycled. A major disappointment."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....................,"Ugh. This music is for the same people who can find 3EB or Matchbox 20 talented. Incredibly boring. Yes, they have talent, but each song sounds the same!!! Do yourself a favor, and go pick up some Nirvana or NIN."
2,Too General to be of Help,"It begins with a long trail-less intro with info about Hawaii that can be found in other sources. This is followed by descriptions of a few trails on each island.Only a few trails are covered, so unless you plan a specific trail, the book is not much help. If you use the book to choose a trail one ""advantage"" is that you will not have many to choose from (and the number choices in Hawaii is staggering).Knowing a bit about the Oahu trails, not necessarily the best are covered and the ones included are not fully representive.The bus directions are good addition, because not all the trails are loops making the logistics for tourists difficult. I would advise anyone relying on this information for to check the schedules which can be found on the internet (search for The Bus Hawaii)."
1,Randy's lyrics direct from God's word.,Shining down from the Father of lights is one song everyone must hear. Not just for the words which honor the LORD but for the music. Also the first track song regarding seeing God's hand is excellent. Don't let another day go by without listening to this song or buying this CD.
5,La Jolla: A Celebration of its Past,"My husband is very impressed with Patricia Daly-Lipe's book, so much so that I haven't had a chance to read it yet. He has read a number of books about our home town of La Jolla and found this one to be truly superior to the typical tourist offering. The overall quality of the book is demonstrated by the breadth of the topics covered coupled with the knowledgable glimpses of La Jolla offered by several resident authors."
5,Fostering a Scientific Imagination,"I am actually looking at the 1952 edition of this book as I write this. Like the previous reviewer, I was given this book as a child & devoured it. It helped make me a lifelong reader & gave me a life-long interest in the natural world. I cannot think of a better way to prime a child's imagination. The illustratons opened worlds to me & the text explained those worlds. Even this old edition is refreshingly free from religious qualifications of Darwin: you get the straight stuff here. (I'm about to order the latest edition for a young friend: I hope I'll find the same scientific rigor.)"
1,Overhyped poo poo,The only good thing about this band is their clever song titles. Everything else is a disappointment and not worth my time.
5,Inexpensive communication,This product allows driver and passenger to communicate on a motorcycle. It is very user friendly and has an input for a cd player or whatever.
2,"Weird, very weird.","Uh huh... Being fans of bands like the foo fighters, incubus, joyrop and the cranberries this is not what I expected. I originally heard the song unmarked helicopters. This cd is full of weird weird stuff. The music is strange, especially the use of the upright bass. The vocals are also not so good. But what I like the least is that it's just weird. It's serious-weird, no like other bands that are weird on purpose. Soul Coughing was just a weird band. I can't personally recommend it."
2,"too much, too little","This computer game doesn't cater enough to young toddlers by guiding them through basic computer usage. The opening screen is completely without intuitive choices (you have to move your mouse over a part of the screen for anything to move/change enough to show it as an option.When you finally reach one of the games ... they are not anything remotely educational or even .... decent to play? Confusing to even an adult, really. I was disappointed, especially compared to the ""older"" games in this series."
4,Sneakin' Out - 4.5 stars,"Before we had Brandy, Monica & Aaliyah we had the inimitable, Stacy Lattisaw!! I grew up listening to this girl and could not believe the voice coming out of a 13/14 year old girl. I happily bought her greatest hits cd but it doesn't include one of my favorite ballads - I COULD LOVE YOU SO DIVINE.Her rendition of this song still sends chills up my spine & makes me wish I could sing as well as she can. This ballad as well as all of the other great ballads of hers are not too old or too mature for her - they all possess a sweet innocense that is indeed lost on the teen singers of today's music biz.This album, produced by the great Narada Michael Walden who worked on all of Stacy's initial releases is one of the best r&b; albums of the 80's. Stacy Lattisaw's voice is indeed missed in the music world but at least we are able to relive the magic of her voice through the re-release of her albums. If you can get your hands on this disc, ENJOY!!"
1,1.3 Billion of Chinese remembers,"In 1970, Willie Brandt, who bravely fought in the Norwegian resistance against the Nazis during the war, fell to his knees at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial. He was a symbol of atonement for his country's war time guilt.By contrast, we are reminded constantly that Japan has yet to own up to anything. If ever there is anything that unites all Chinese, it is the belief of NEVER AGAIN.In addition to the 1.3 billion Chinese, countless other Asians who suffered in the hands of the Japanese also remembers.Shall we also add the ghosts of the American, British and Russian POWs who were tortured and killed when they were used to test chemical and bacteria warfare devices?[...]"
1,Remember,Just remember- for years after World War II the Germans denied the Holicaust ever happened also
1,shame on you,"Some japanese right-wingers have always trying to change their history! shame on you! They cannot face what they did in WW2, they need lies to make them feel good."
4,Above average but not great.,"I find it hard to apply wax when I have to dry my car.Since you need to apply the wax WHILE your car is wet (right after shampooing), too much of the wax goes to waste when I squeeze the towel to dry my car.Other than that, it gives your car a decent gloss. It also offers decent protection.Eagle One's NanoWax (spray type) is easier to apply but this one is cheaper where I'm from. :)HTH. :)"
4,bring it back,"I am an adult, I do not like to read alot,but I do remeber reading this book as a kid and wish to read it again as an adult if i could find it.! the authers ability to create a vivid images in your imagination to the piont of smelling, seeing, and feeling it is extrodinary! a must read for all alike!"
5,this is the greatest book i ever read!,"I read this book probably 9 years ago and although I never was a big reader I am a writer. Now that I'm getting into reading more, I would love to have my own copy of this book. It was the first book I ever read from cover to cover. Anytime I told anyone about the book, no one had ever heard of it. I'm glad to see that other people feel the way i do about this magnifacent book."
4,VERY DIFFERENT BUT ENJOYABLE ALBUM FROM R.E.M.,"FOR CANCELLING A TOUR, R.E.M. PROMISED FANS A HARDER SOUNDING ALBUM. WELL, THIS IS THAT ALBUM. THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL R.E.M. ALBUM OF THEM ALL. BUT, THIS IS VERY ENTERTAINING. THE BEST TRACKS ARE ''WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY, KENNETH?'', ''CRUSH ON EYELINER'', ''STAR 69'', ''KING OF COMEDY'', AND ''TONGUE''. THIS IS THE CLOSEST THING YOU'LL EVER HAVE TO A HARD ROCK ALBUM FROM R.E.M. ALSO, LISTEN FOR THE SUPRISING MOMENT IN WHICH MICHAEL STIPE SAYS F**K NEAR THE END OF ''WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY, KENNETH?''."
4,Monster ~ R.E.M.,"This is indeed not the most consistent album REM has ever made but this is a daring and creative experiment. Most the songs on this album are buried in loud guitars and drums and Michael's lyrics are again quite hard to decipher. It's quite cool when you know what he's singing, a lot of sexual references and black humor.1.What's The Frequency Kenneth? 5/52.Crush With Eyeliner 5/53.King Of Comedy 3/54.I Dont Sleep, I Dream 5/55.Star 69 4/56.Strange Currencies 5/57.Tongue 5/58.Bang And Blame 5/59.I Took Your Name 3/510.Let Me In 4/511.Circus Envy 3/512.You 3/5"
2,"What's the frequency, Michael?","Let me start off by saying I am not an ""R.E.M. snob"" who thinks the band's last good album was released in say 1985 or so. In fact, ""Monster"" was the band's first album that I truly did not like. It starts off with the fantastic single and Dan Rather diss ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" and then its straight downhill from there. One problem, I think, is that this was R.E.M.'s long promised return to their rockin' roots. By this point, they were simply no longer capable of creating interesting harder edged songs. Overall, this is an unfortunate misstep for a fine band."
4,"""R.E.M."" rock!","It's true, this may not be ""Murmur"" or ""Out Of Time"", but it's still an amazing album. I think they really needed to make this record, just as ""U2"" had to do ""Achtung Baby"" at that time. Also, them jumping onto the alt-grunge bandwagon is nonsense. ""Monster"" was the natural progression after ""Everybody Hurts"" and ""Shiny Happy People"". Plus, this album has it's own share of hits, including the great opener ""What's The Frequency, Kenneth?"", ""Strange Currencies"", and ""Bang And Blame"". I think ""Star 69"" and ""Crush With Eyeliner"" were even minor hits. There's only about two tracks I don't consider that good. Overall, ""Monster"" is essential for my collection, especially since only one track made the recent ""Best Of"". Perfect album title too."
4,Not your typical R.E.M. but Don't Let That Deter You!,"I know many R.E.M. fans who carped about the departure made by the band here in terms of the sound of ""Monster"".Know what? I'm glad they did it. I like when a band is willing to take risks; I like it even better when that risk pays off. R.E.M.'s ""Monster"" is a terrific album from beginning to end.Catchy songs such as ""What's the Frequency Kenneth?"", ""Crush with Eyeliner"", ""King of Comedy"", and ""Star 69"", make you move whether you like it or not.""I Don't Sleep, I Dream"", ""Tongue"", and ""Strange Currencies"" are the type of evocative and pensive songs R.E.M. does so well.""Bang and Blame"" is a great song, period.I know that this doesn't sound like the band's early work, or even like what was to be found on ""Out of Time"" and ""Automatic for the People"" but to me it's a splendid detour, one that few other bands would dare take, much less do with such aplomb."
2,Eh...,"Okay, Amazon, thanks for telling me how to feel. ""Strange Currencies"" better than ""Everybody Hurts""? I don't think so. As many people have pointed out, there are only two goods songs on here (and both are classics): ""What's the Frequency"" and ""Bang the Blame"". It's so dissapointing that REM can't put out a totally solid album. With this band, it seems their hits are all classics (rightfully), and everything else is just mediocre or worse. There's no middle ground with these guys. I think I'm being generous with two stars for two songs, but whatever."
3,Far too repetitive,"I loved every album from REM before this one and every one after hi-fi.This one left me a bit flat. There are 2 or three good songs but the rest are identical. Twangy, distorted riffs that are all too similar. They should have named them song 1, song 1 part 2, song 1 part 3, ect. It would have been more honest.It doesn't suck, but it is probably their weakest effort, right behind hifi."
2,Whoops! R.E.M.'s Big Mistake,"This is one of the weakest efforts I ever heard from R.E.M. Instead of innovating, they seemed to prefer imitating on this one. The main problem: the band mistakenly thought that adding a little bit of feedback to otherwise mediocre songs would make listeners think they had a new, inventive sound. They're not fooling anyone. They do succeed in a few songs, namely ""Bang and Blame,"" ""Star 69,"" and ""Crush With Eyeliner."" The rest of this CD is forgettable filler."
2,Redundant,"This alblum has too much of one thing that sounds old after awhile. Specifically, there are too many songs that sound alike, with loud/fuzzy guitars and all. Melodically it is weak too. BUT it does have what I think is one of their best songs: ""Bang and Blame"" (which is depressing in tone, but beautiul melodically and compositionally). Overall, it needs more variety of sound, tone, and subtlety. This is by far REM's worse alblum. Buy the singles to the hit songs instead of the alblum and save yourself some money."
4,"The rocky REM. Yes, you heard right.","REM are notoriously one of those bands that have a great formula, but don't tend to vary it much. Well, if Monster were better known, that perception might well change. While not as quintessential as Automatic, relentlessly optimistic as Out of Time or experimental as Up, Monster is an interesting record. Tracks like opener What's the Frequency, Kenneth with its driving powerchords, Crush With Eyeliner, with it's quirky rhythms, Let Me In with its Nirvana influence and Circus Envy with it's metallic ending demonstrate REM's ability to go rock, whilst Strange Currencies and Tongue stay true to vintage REM. Some critisised REM for this change in direction, but it clearly, important marks a necessary respite from a formula, that, while generally very good, could grow tiresome on some albums like the much over-rated Green."
2,"Read the fans' reviews here, not the critics","As if you needed any more proof that mainstream ""rock"" critics don't know what the heck they're talking about and are only trying to sell magazines (and CDs!), just check out the blurbs here above the fans' feedback. SPIN calling Monster REM's best since Murmur?!? Sheesh - give me a break! This is yucky stuff. Kenneth, wake up!"
3,Meh.,"Geass isn't very good. The things about it that I enjoy have been done much better in other shows. I watch this with family members, because it's easier for them to get into than Mobile Suit Gundam or Deathnote. They seem to enjoy it a lot more than I do.If you like colorful images, military tactics, revenge stories, and soap operas, you'll probably enjoy the first season of Code Geass. If you're new to anime and you're looking for an entry point, this works."
5,Sinus Relief,"As a chronic sufferer of sinus congestion along with snoring problems, I found this rinse to be a wonder drug!. Not only did it improve my breathing but it also lessened the degree of my snoring and I no longer wake up in the middle of the night with a dry sore throat!"
1,Mixed feelings about this product,"I ordered two sets, one for me and the other as a gift for a co-worker. Typical for Amazon, the items were poorly packaged. One set arrived safely. The other set had 1 medium size bowl broken. I decided to keep the broken set rather than returning the item due to the shipping cost would be more than the item itself. The lids are somewhat difficult to work with, taking some effort to cover the bowls. But I like the fact that the glass material is less likely to harm you, compared to plastic containers, which I use for dry goods. Do I recommend this item? No."
2,Begin the Harp,"This moves too quickly through the lessons. Accompanied by a teacher it may make more sense, but alone and with no prior experience it is, in my opinion, not a worth while investment. Many of the lessons include only a few lines of certain songs, which is frustrating if you want to play ALL of ""Greensleeves"". I would suggest ""Teach Yourself to Play the Folk Harp by Sylvia Woods"" book and DVD, especially if you do not have a teacher handy.This book is good for a quick review if you haven't played in a long time."
5,Book for new harp learners,the book was as described and is helpful in for a beginner who allready has some experience with other instruments.
4,Emma Smith DVD,A little disappointed in the content of this DVD. Seemed to be a repeat of the story of Joseph Smith - nothing new. karen
4,Ancient Aliens,It is good for inforamtion. The video and pictures are very good.I don't have a anything else to say so this should fill your word counter.
5,an indispensible book for those who'd rather have fun than new furniture,Daring decorating for pennies. I love this one and plan to buy it for all of my frends and relatives who love individual expression more than ostentatious spending in their homes. A set decorator's approach.
4,Long forgotten summer,"Long forgotten summer 1969 in Leeds haunts a lot of people, after the bones of a small child are found in the attic of a newly bought house.Tragic event from 30 years ago forever scarred a group of people.When the new owner of the house, Matt Harper decides to investigate, past becomes alive again.Robert Barnard is well known for his fairly short books with logical puzzles and sharp wit.He is one of the last old-fashioned Brittish writers who plays by the rules of detection. This lovely book wae a great pleasure."
4,A lovely book of poetry,"As a woman going through a loss of faith and religion I feel very connected to this book. I feel a connection of a soul level to a religion and faith that I no longer can carry or believe in, yet it still consumes so much of who I am and how I relate to the world.I really identified with so much of this work. I am glad to have it."
1,Disappointing,Extremely poor job on a subject that had extremely high potential. Bill Maher would of done it justice.
5,Tom Petty's Best,"I have always loved Tom Petty, but to have an album where ALL the songs are good is hard to find.It starts off with the uplifting, and beautiful acoustic song ""Wildflowers,"" that just gives a really optimistic view of things.I personally like all the songs on the album, the only really significantly great songs on here would be ""Don't Don't Know How It Feels"" ""Time to Move on"" ""Wreck Me"", ""Honey Bee,"" ""Hard On Me"",""To Find a Friend"", ""A Higher Place"" and the last song ""Wake Up Time"" a wise song about your dreams, goals, your past and love. Cause it's wake up time, it's time to open your eyes and rise and shine. Tom Petty, the rock genius, is still going strong and this album shows that."
3,Pick this bunch,"3 1/2The second side looses a bit of pulse, but Wildflowers remains one of Petty's most engaging works, the only one I've cared to own actually. Not being a classic rock fan in particular, some of his deepest and diverse studio work sounds evident throughout, likely your classic case of a Rubin sandwich artist revitalization."
4,A Typical Tom Petty Album,"By the release of ""Wildflowers"" it was apparent that Tom Petty was never going to record the universally acknowledged masterpiece album of which all his fans have thought him capable. The closest he ever came was the adventuresome ""Southern Accents"" in 1985. Since then, Petty has settled into a comfortable groove, recoding albums that feature twangy giutars, his signature nasal vocals and a few pop gems. The best tracks here are the title song, ""You Don't Know How it Feels,"" ""You Wreck Me"" and ""A Higher Place."" All four will be fine additions to his next Greatest Hits album. Between those highlights are plenty of pleasent filler material, with the occasional clunker, ""Honey Bee"" in particular.Overall, ""Wildflowers"" will please any Tom Petty fan, but it is unlikely to win him any new converts."
2,"Ok, but nothing great.",The book is a modified version of Swindoll's sermons on 2 Corinthians. The editor simply took Swindoll's transcripts and made it into a study guide with some questions at the end of each chapter.This is one study book you can probably skip over. The questions were personal reflection questions and would probably not be real good for group study.
3,For Intellects Only,"Reading this book was like plodding through a minefield, slow, cautious and the dread feeling of what may lie ahead. Although this book was well written and had a lot of theories based upon the numerous reflections of intellectual writers, I found it to be overly pedantic and written in often difficult to comprehend intelligentsiaese. Upon finally finishing this book I tried to reflect what I had read and wasn't quite sure of what the writer was trying to convey. I am certain that I have above average intellectual congnitive reasoning, but this book was way over my head. I would compare reading this book to deciphering poetry."
5,Autisms.org - Book Review,"This is the long awaited 2000 edition of a book written for special education teachers, school administrators, psychologists, speech therapists, and advocates and parents concerning the education of preschool-age children with Autism and ASD.Service providers of various programs for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders were asked to answer questions regarding structure, staffing, financing, curriculum, assessment procedures, and support services of their program. Invaluable resource for people interested in providing, comparing, or procuring top-notch services."
1,Oh gawd it was bad!,Save your money. This is one of the worst gay movies ever made. The only entertainment it gave me was when I distroyed the cd and threw it in the garbage.
3,Beautiful People of Rather Boring Story,"This is a story of the Hollywood of the McCartney's witch-hunting of the fifties last century: saving their business tricky producers had a same-gender attracted male movie star married to a beauty, a traditional Hollywood - comedy happy-ending- with-some-twist followed.For a contemporary, post-""Brokeback Mountain"" reviewer story looks being a farce rather than a comedy."
3,A SENIOR LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE,"I AM LIVING IN A SENIOR LIVING ATMOSPHERE AND SOME OF US WANTED TOLEARN SPANISH. EVEN THOUGH MOST OF US HAD 2 YEARS IN COLLEGE.SINCE I USE AMAZON.COM FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING I THOUGHT WHY NOTORDER SOME DICTIONARIES FOR OUR GROUP. THIS BOOK ""WEBSTER'S SPANISH-ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR STUDENTS"" IS A MUST FOR All STUDENTS. IT IS SO VALUABLE TO US. ALSO ORDERED ""EASY SPANISH PHRASE BOOK"" BY DOVERPUBLICATIONS, INC. THESE ARE THE ONLY BOOKS WE USE. I COULDN'T RATE THEM HIGH ENOUGH. THEY ARE VITAL... AMAZON DELIVERED THEM 3 DAYSLATER JUST IN TIME FOR OUR NEXT CLASS. THANK YOU FOR CARRYING THEM.A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER, MINA SPENCER (mina-spencer@hotmail.com)"
1,"Problems, problems - no Sony support","The mouse runs backwards and the screen blacks out 1 out of 7 starts, very unreliable. Sony offers no support other than their website, which seems not to provide any knowledge of these issues. At least acknowledge the problem and offer a fix and be accountable for the product quality."
3,ok for money,"I bought this lemon a few months ago. It seemed to work well with car and bicycle air pressure. However,I made an error in rating. The unit worked ok, but my cigarette lighter fuse burned out . This item is worthwhile for buying."
4,A beautiful story line .. but one complaint...,"I thought it was a beautiful story line, and as a single professional working mother of a two-year-old, I bought it knowing how it applied to my situation. The illustrations were beautiful pastels and my daughter and I enjoyed them very much. I was disappointed however to see that the mother was constantly shown wearing a very prominent gold wedding ring on each illustration that showed her left hand. Not all working mothers are married and I felt that these illustrations were reflective of a social 'ideal' that for some of us is outdated. Some single moms choose to be single moms. And when my daughter is old enough, I plan to explain to her that ideal parental-child relationships are not dependent upon wedding rings or marriage vows. We both enjoyed the story very much however, and I would recommend this book to other working mothers, both single and married."
4,Charming and Sentimental,"As a working mom, this was a book I couldn't resist. Of course, I don't bear much of a resemblance to the mama in this story, but I think my toddlers (both boys) get the picture. The comforting notion seems to resonate with them that after a long day, mama will come home to the sweet bedtime routine."
4,"solid, dreamy atmospheric record",great disk to put on and escape the world. natacha atlas ad's a sultry feel with her voice... great ambient effort by an established band. this thing has held up really well in my collection.
2,Think twice before getting this book...,"...if you knew who wrote this book, you'll never want to read it. Lauren Child is the creator of Charlie & Lola. Although Lauren Child's artwork is really good, she made a bad choice to waste it on Charlie & Lola. Other than that, the book looks like a good book about a girl kids can relate to. But the fact that this person's the same person who created Charlie & Lola takes away 3 stars. If you'd like to read a good book, try out the W.I.T.C.H series or Tokyo Mew Mew."
4,Very cool...but give us something NEW!,"And by new, I mean LIVE!! When is Def Lep gonna come out with a live concert DVD? The Rock of Ages tour was the perfect time to do it, does anyone know if they are planning on releasing anything recent of a live concert? Thats the hardest thing to find for Lep, live footage!This was a good DVD though, like others have said, great for the casual fan. But us die-hards need MORE!!"
4,Worth it for the remastered sound!,"I must disagree with the conclusion reached by the previous reviewer (and fellow Def Leppard fanatic -- I, too, have every official Def Leppard release imaginable). There are more than 3 interesting things about this DVD. Yes, the commentary and 2 new videos are great, but what really makes the difference to me is the newly remastered surround sound, particularly the DTS track. You have never heard Def Leppard like this before! Perhaps the previous reviewer is without the benefit of a surround sound system, but it really makes all the difference. But like the other reviewer, I deduct one star for some missing videos, including ""Long Long Way To Go"" and ""Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)"". But overall, this is well worth having, even if you already own Historia and Visualize."
2,This is just a repeat of the review of Lost City: Part 1,"I got this episode because the my dvd was damaged and the Lost City: Part 1 & 2 were not viewable. I wanted to see if I should replace the seventh season of Stargate SG-1. I found out that these two episodes are probably my least favorite of all of the episodes of all of the seasons. I guess there is no reason to replace the set. I was very dissappointed that General Hammond was replaced and I really, really don't like the character Vice President Kinsey. No offence to anyone, but he is a lot like scum."
5,Stargate SG-1 Season 7 Box Set,What anawesome season! Michael Shanks returns full time as Daniel Jackson. I think it is one of the best seasons of the series.
4,"Daniel Jackson returns, and all is good... in the first half","In the beginning of season 7, we regained much of the character interaction that had been lacking since sometime in season 4. Fallen was quite possibly one of the top 5 Stargate episodes ever. It had action, adventure, and great character development. The first half was amazing, with only a few pitfalls along the way (Avenger 2.0).Unfortunately, the second half of the season just went downhill with way too much focus on romance. (Who cares if Carter has a boyfriend anyway? I'll Days of Our Lives if I want lame love stories.)I recommend you buy this set. Even though some of the episodes were bad, season 7 reclaims some of the magic that Stargate had lost."
4,Stargate is great but Disk 5 of this set is BAD!!!!!,Tried 2 different sets and Amazon was great about sending the replacement for the first set BUT on both sets on Disk 5 the shows are scrambled.
2,Source Material,"I remember from my youth the comic book being way better than the film. Watching as an adult only reaffirmed my childhood acumen as a critic. This movie is so amazingly boring it made me long for the comic book and a Vicodin. Failing that, I found the remote and put this epic on permanent pause."
5,Highly Recommended On All Levels,"Great entertainment and historically correct, for the most part. Richard Burton plays a convincing Alexander. From the start, with the background on Alexander's youth and his relationship with his father Philip and mother Olympias, the movie awesomely captures history. The battle scenes are recreated very well. I especially liked the post-battle scene at Chaeronea with the drunken Philip's singing echoing through the valley. Only minor errors, such as Darius's daughter being called Roxanne (a Bactrian princess) instead of Statira, can easily be overlooked. Alexander in fact, married both women anyway. The Persians are also shown historically correct for the most part, especially Darius' murder and the scene at Persepolis. For an under two-hour movie, what you get is quite spectacular. Of course, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reduce to film everything in Alexander's life."
2,Rossen the Lesser,"The faux Shakespearian dialog by Robert Rossen not only induced me to chuckle but it has the unfortunate effect of inspiring Richard Burton to give a bellowing, mannered performance -- maybe hoping to distract from his pitifully non-athletic physique and grotesque blonde wig.The direction, also by Robert Rossen, reminds me of the worse of the old Italian sword-and-sandals films with failed efforts to make a cast of tens seem larger and make cheap sets to look lived-in.The history is mix of authentic and questionable, but the vital importance of military tactics has been reduced to simple brute force in cheaply staged battle scenes.Lovely French icon Danielle Darrieux (in a dark wig -- contrary to Burton) comes off best as the embittered and ambitious mother of Alexander. She and the 'famous moments of legend' earn any positive rating I give this."
1,What a dull movie!,"I truly do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about Alexander the Great. I have been reading about the Great Macedonian for four years and I connot explain how completely inaccurate this movie is. Everything from the costumes to the characters are incorrect. The armor the soldiers and Alexander wear looks very close to fifth century BC armor, especially the helmets which have feathered plumes and not horsehair plumes. This is suppose to be the fourth century BC! King Darius's daughter was not Roxane in reality, the movie portrays her as being so. She was the daughter of some barbarian Alexander captured. There are so many mistakes in this movie I have to give the director some credit for at least trying to create this movie."
3,Jumpstart Preschool,"It's pretty good, but reader rabbit is better. I guess I expected a little more. It doesn't keep my child's attention nearly as long as reader rabbit does because of the way it's designed. Reader Rabbit is designed as an exploration/adventure type of game where you go exploring from screen to screen. Jumpstart preschool is a one room preschool and you click here and there."
3,a mainstream history of the adventures of george and karl,"The latest batch of big selling books about our president are shamelessly laudatory and the covers of the books tell you how much the authors are keen on the prez. From looking at the cover of this book you might get the impression that it was taking aim at Bush instead. No such luck. While the book doesn't continuously glorify Bush / Rove there is a LOT of dirt they glib right over. All in all, an unsurprising,speedy and light mainstream press (and yes, that's a bad thing) account of of the adventures of Bush and Rove."
1,Skip this one,"This book is pretty lousy. They rhyming is forced, the rhythm is off and on throughout, and it is way too long for small kids. I'll be donating this one."
5,WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS STORY FOR YOUNG & OLD,"""A Wish to be a Christmas Tree"" is a wonderful family Christmas story about a big tree who wants to be chosen for a family's Christmas tree but it has grown too big. The animals of the forest convince him he is their Christmas tree in many ways all year long. There are very thought provoking statements from the animals. I bought 2 copies of the board book for my 4 younger grandchildren and a hardcover copy for my 2 older grandchildren. The books are sturdy and beautifully illustrated and will surely be read every Christmas. I read the book as soon as I received it and wished I had found it before Christmas but they will keep until next year to give as Thanksgiving gifts as I am sure the grandchildren will read ""A Wish to be a Christmas Tree"" many times before Christmas. Such a treasure find!"
2,OK product,"I usually get Reese Large Pearl, but the Amazon site said back order and not sure when available. I ordered Bacom. It is a good product, better than regular store product and I would have been very excited if I did not know of Reese. Easy to fix and a good product."
3,Design flaw,"I bought these sunglasses 18 months ago. They fit well, don't fog over, and are comfortable to wear. I put the glasses in the case when not wearing them.However, both lens have developed a worn spot on the sides of the lens because when the frames are folded shut,the end of the frame touches the glass. Opening & closing the frames rubs the end of the frames against the lens which caused the worn spot. Luckily the worn spots are outside of the vision field.Good glasses, poor design. I'll keep wearing them but won't buy this style again."
5,A TOUCHING LOVE STORY - A TOUCH OF FRANCE!,"Trouble starts when Domenique asks her bookish sister, Kimberly Jamison to switch places with her. Twins do that sometimes.Kim does not feel comfortable with her sisters' life style - but boy are they beautiful. The gal not the life style.Domenique finally admits to a drinking problem, helped by our villian, but does not want to give up her place as a top fashion model.Kim is afraid that she cannot fool the elderly designer of the famous House of Duroche or their model's dresser.When she meets the American partner, Philippe de Claremont sparks are struck - good or bad is debatible!Enter our villian. Kim is not aware of Domenique's dealings with him. [I've seen him before]Ah, but love blossoms in the strangest places. Beautiful background - Philippe's sister and their home. Wonderful RomanceHIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- GREAT addition to your collection."
4,No seat No game,"At first when i saw this video I was a little afraid, why?? Everything was going so fast (the moves the kicks) but after 3 days I started seeing a change AND burn!! love it..."
1,Not even worth the stars,The tape was a waste. No results. It took a long time to receive. Never by from this person ever in life !
4,Unimpressive build quality,"If you're planning to use this polarizer with a hood on, especially a deeper one, this is probably not a filter for you. For whatever reason Hoya only serrated the outer edge, and the front part is absolutely smooth. You won't be able to turn it unless you can somehow squeeze your finger between the hood and the filter edge.For a few dollars more you can get B&W; multi-coated filter like this, whose maker put a little bit more thought in the design. B&W; also seems generally better built.The coating on my copy of this Hoya doesn't actually reach the very edge of the glass on one side, and when I look closely I can see a gap in coating where the metal ring meets the glass. The gap is tiny and it doesn't actually matter in the photos, but it does leave a bad impression.Optically I haven't noticed anything obviously wrong with it. It's still a multi-coated polarizer, so guess it's an okay value all-in-all."
4,Original Nikon lens cap cannot fit the filter,The filter is very thin which gives good result at the corners of the pictures. This means there are no more shades around the pictures especially with wide angle captures.Though this thin rim of the lens causes another problem:The original lens cap of Nikon cannot fit the filter. There fore I have to protect it with its own rubber cap.
5,Perfection,This is without a doubt the best album I own. If you have not heard these guys yet you are really missing out.
2,A Good Boy,"This is a very good boy with a nice tie and nice underwears. He is a good boy and can climb trees. That's what good boys do.Thank You, Good boys"
5,Outstanding!!!,I will keep this short. I am an old school metal fan and have come to love the metal-hardcore movement. I pay attention to vocals and instruments to the nth degree. This is my favorite CD hands down! There is so much power and the delivery is unbelieveable. Sure there are resemblances to other bands but dont try to compare. Buy this CD and listen to it to appreciate it. If this genre is your taste then you be very pleased! Every track is a ripper!Cheers!
5,Great CD at a great price!!!!,"I have all of ATR's CDs except this one. I was so excited I was able to purchase this thru Amazon for a great price. The CD just like the service from this seller did not disappoint. This is probably my second favorite CD from this band. The Fall of Ideals is my favorite CD from this band, but this CD DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! If you like ATR buy this CD! The more I listen to this CD the more it is overtaking The Fall of Ideals....buy the CD and decide for yourself."
3,A couple apples short of a bushel,"Coming only four weeks before Dexter's tour de force 'Homecoming' performance at the Village Vanguard and featuring an all-star rhythm section of Barry Harris, Sam Jones and Al Foster, 'Biting The Apple' is an auspicious affair at face value which unfortunately falls short of it's promise.'Apple Jump' (I Got Rhythm) and 'I'll Remember April' are toe-tapping enough but 'Skylark' is drowsy and tensionless and the two previously unreleased tracks 'Blue Bossa' and 'Georgia On My Mind' really ought have stayed that way in my opinion. It only really gets into gear on the final track 'A La Modal' thanks in large part to Sam Jones' propulsive walking bass line.Some Dex SteepleChase albums I would recommend over this one are 'Bouncin' with Dex', 'The Apartment' and the two live albums with Jackie McLean 'The Source' and 'The Meeting'."
4,A great story of justice overcoming injustice and the spirit of man,"A great read for two reasons. One, the fine story and two, a clear understanding of how much contents can be trimmed from the original text and still produce a successful screen play and film."
3,nice ending,not a movie I would have picked if I'd seen the previews but it was ok.interesting story line. Sad but interesting
2,The Burning Plain,"This writer has no gifts as a director. The work is muddled and lacking in resonance (like his ""Butiful) . His work was excellent when he was collaborating with the director of Amores Perros."
4,Fascinating ~,"I found the ralationships, and their connections, extremely fascinating to watch play out in this movie. If you're interested in family dramas/dynamics, this is the movie for you!"
4,SURPRISED,"J WAS SUPRISED , I WAS WATCHING, NOT REALIZING THAT THERE WHERE FLASH BACKS. I THOUGH AT FRIST I WAS WATCHING THREE ACTRESSES DOING A WONDERFUL JOB. THEN I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT MISS LAWRENCE WAS THE YOUNG MARIANA (CHARILIZE THERON) . WHICH AFTER I CAUGHT UP I WAS MORE APPRECITIVE OF THE QUALITY OF THESE ACTORS AND THE OVERALL MOVIE,"
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Beautiful women of questionable moralsugly men of equally questionable morals--Some one left out the plot when writing the script.Not much acting required--Executive Producer - Charlize Theron, hope she recovers her coins."
4,RENTED MOVIE FOR KINDLE FIRE,RENTED THIS MOVIE TO WATCH DURING A 9 HOUR TRIP AND NOW I KNOW WHY PARENTS TAKE MOVIES FOR CHILDREN TO WATCH ON TRIPS......IT MADE THE TRIP SEEM SHORTER.
5,"BRAVO, BIS RECORDS","One of the great charms of this wondderful recording is to realize the universality of this music. Here are songs bya Cuban composer, known mostly for his popular tunes andmovie scores of the 40's, performed by an American soprano,a British pianist, on a Swedish label (BIS), with a Germanrecording team (recorded in Stockholm)! How more internationalcan you get?The performances are completely genuine, as Cuban-sounding asanything by the composer himself, in his numerous piano solorecordings. This recording is a revelation, and will surelyput these great songs on the musical map. Ms. Farley's beautiful voice, sensitive phrasing, perfect pronunciation and understanding of the style, and Constable's outstanding piano accompaniment justify Gramophone's selection of this CD as theEditor's Choice.BIS is doing a great service to this music, as it has done with Tirino's path braking piano series. More of both please!AndresTampa, Florida"
5,ROMANTIC BALLADS BY CUBAN'S OWN GERSHWIN,"These popular ballads ride the edge between popular and classical. They are obviously meant for the mass public,like Cole Porter' songs. However, like Kurt Weill -hiscontemporary- Ernesto Lecuona was classically trainedand forward thinking. His harmonies are often quiteoriginal as are his melodic turns. The poems he usesunfortunately are mostly banal and repetitive, but theyactual just seem a pretext for the music, which isextremely beautiful. The performances here are firstrate. Ms. Farley has an extremely beautiful voice andshe understands and conveys the meaning of each songwith great finesse and artistry. Bravo to BIS forcontinuing their Lecuona series with such a greatnew disc. More please!L.R.New York"

Whether you just want to put up a couple jars of jam every once in a while, or are ready to be self sustaining and can an entire garden's worth, this reference will be your guide time and time again.Not only are there specific time tables, but the recipes are delicious and interesting. Each chapter also ends with a tasty way to incorporate your canning into a tasty homecooked recipe to showcase your wonderful canning abilities.The Ball Blue Book should be a staple in the home of every canner."
5,food preservation,"This a great book for anyone, whether you are an old hat at food preservation or just starting out I suggest you get a copy for your library."
4,Ball Blue Book Guide to Preserving,"The book arrived promptly, and it was in good shape.I matched it with my older one, and felt the few recipes left out should have been included, as they were not obsolete as far as safety was concerned.I did not like, however, the format. It was much nicer and easier to read in the older version."
3,Good--- if you own both typs of canners,"I purchased this book from a local store, but I will be returning it. The first half is dedicated to high acid foods, and the book only gives instructions on processing these in a water bath canner. I have a pressure canner, and have no intentions of getting a water bath canner, so without adaptive instructions, half of this book is useless to me."
5,Hawaiian Sun Juice,"Hawaiian Sun Juice is terrific. Only problem it's difficult to purchase in our area. Delicious, highly recomend it if you haven't tried it, comes in several differentflavors. A top drink in Hawaii. Thanks Amazon.com for getting it."
1,Garbage,"From the moment I bought this Pocket PC it's been giving me problems. Not user friendly, battery life is a joke and overall, the product is garbage. Not worth a penny...junk."
2,WE WANT THAT SRV MTV!,I just want to know why MTV would hold back these live unplugged jams of Stevie Ray Vaughan playing a 12 string? .....wish they would come out with a video or just the SRV songs on a disk....I bet thay would make alot of money off it.
5,LOVED IT,"This book is awesome. If you liked Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe, then you should read Gotham Tragic. The author uses a glamorous New York City restaurant as a backdrop for the antics that follow. The characters are all excellent--some are sympathetic, some are hilarious, some are despicable. The story is a page-turner that doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Fullscreen,Not bad for the price. Family-friendly. You probably have friends who tried to sell you stuff like this in the 80's and 90's.Be aware it's not widescreen though.
5,True/Key points that will change your LIFE,This book WILL help any professional hone their skills as well as teach you to use the personal unique skill sets to your advantage.
5,Out of the box thinking at its best,"If you really want to take your business or personal earning capabilities to the top, then you must have this book. Jay is simply the best in learning how to tap your inner resources and use what you have to get what you want. This book will give you more profit making ideas than you'll have time to implement. Any single chapter is worth a hundred times the selling price. If the idea of working smarter, not harder sounds appealing, then this book's for you."
1,It's all been done.,"My first reaction from having read this book was, ""DUH""! Aside from anecdotes about how well his clients are doing, the author doesn't seem to offer anything original here. Most of the tips and techniques are not given in any great detail; perhaps Mr. Abrahams hopes we'll attend one of his seminars, because this book reads like a transcription of what I imagine his oral presentation to be like. I only wish I'd had time to read the book before the 30-day money-back guarantee expired."
4,Marketing Success Becomes Instantly Clear Now!,"Mr. Abraham's message can be distilled into 3 things: 1) get more customers, 2) get them to buy more, and 3) get them to buy more often.The book spends the rest of the time telling stories around these themes. I've attended his seminar, bought his tapes, and also have this book. Personally, I wished that he used ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"" as his book model instead of ""Awaken the Giant Within.""This is one of those books that you know has lots of stuff in it, but you get bogged down in it, it's no fun reading it, and it sits there on your shelf.Memo to Mr. Abrahams: We know you're America's #1 Marketing Wizard. Please get someone to help you rewrite this book. It's too hard a pill to shallow."
5,Very comfortable,Our house has some carpet covered floor and most wood flooring. These shoes worked really well. I am still very comfortable in them. They do expand after a while but still haven't had an issue with them coming out of my feet.
4,good deal,"The glasses were shipped very quickly. They came in a box which included a sturdy case to protect the glasses. Always a good sign that the producer wants to protect their product. The glasses fit me very well. I liked the clarity of the lenses. I wore them on a drive down to Los Angeles which is about a six hour one way trip and l didn't get ""sunglass nose"" where they make that deep dent. They kept the sun out from both the sides and the top. I'm very happy and will probably buy another pair at some time."
5,"Great sunglasses, great price !!!","I was looking for a great pair of sunglasses but at a reasonable price...I finally found them. Great fit, great lenses, basically...fantastic sunglasses."
3,Poor editing or ???,"Factual errors in history or natural history can often be ignored as typographical, as in 'Wagons West' by Frank McLynn where he refers to the West coast tribe near which Lewis and Clark over-wintered in 1805-06 as the 'catslops' (yes, sic, cat slop, why not just call them cat-sick, funnier).Worse is John Keegan in 'Fields of Battle' having Thomas Jefferson visiting Bent's Fort in 1833. Hope I'm that active at 90 years old, not to mention dead.But in a book by an ecologist published by Oxford Press and selling at $38.00 retail, I kind of expect better than to find on page 4 a satellite photo of the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri the caption of which, in no uncertain terms, describes the Missouri and the Illinois merging before meeting the Mississippi, both to the East of the Mississippi."
5,Good Book,All of Rosanne Bittner books are good. I like the characters and the way the books move through their lives.
3,nice but smaller than expected,"Beautiful photo on the shirt, but even though I ordered a 3X, it was still too small. My husband usually has no trouble wearing 3X in other shirt brands so we were both dissapointed."
3,Okay,"My daughter is 5 and loves to sew, but she was bored after a few minutes with this. It might be because she likes to sew what SHE wants, rather than filling in the toy's design with the exact colors she's supposed to use."
1,No Vista support,"SIIG does not have drivers for Vista for this card. They do have cards with Vista drivers, check their website. (They do have drivers for Win 2k & XP). Since I bought it for Vista I rated it 1 star and am returning it."
2,This is not an Arthur C Clarke book.,"This book was written by Mr. McQuay based on a 850 word outline by Mr. Clarke (as Mr. Clarke explains in the afterword). McQuay ought to be listed as the author and Mr. Clarke's name ought not appear as an author (he was not consulted during the writing and simply approved the final draft). The resulting book is wildly implausable and has some of the worst cyberpunk and racial cliches I have seen in a long time. America is ""owned"" by sinister orientals and the fanatical Nation of Islam plots racial war. The cliches and outright ""cheese"" actually make this book quite funny, saving it from a lower rating."
1,"NO MUSIC, <1 min interview with Tom Morello",This DVD is basically an interview with people who are Rage fans. No Music. No concert footage. There is less than 1 minute of an interview with Tom Morello. That's it. No Zack. No Brad. No YTimK. Definitely not worth the price.
4,I really enjoy this album,"I suppose people think of this as a bad release because it wasn't originally intended to be so. Well, get off the hype machine and actually listen to this album. I really don't get it, all the tracks on this album are strong, some rather strange, but you can't be a Prince fan without getting into his eccentricities, that's what makes him such an influential artist, not just being catchy and living off of Purple Rain (Prince has never tried to make another Purple Rain, except maybe for 'Around The World In A Day').My favorite tracks would be 'Le Grind', 'Bob George', and 'Superfunky...'; but honestly I don't hear a single weak piece in the entire mix, and while 'When 2 R In Love', an awesome ballad, does bring down the tempo, it still works sandwiched between the two minimalist hip hop pieces.There isn't really any underlining theme to this album, but overall it's a good listen."
5,Amazing,"Prince has proved yet again, with this album that he is the king! He puts the ""R"" in R&B!!!!!"
2,The Unbelievable,"Great cinamatograhpy, great acting, great locations, stupid story. There is no way a group of men from that time are going to get themselves killed getting this guy 'safely' to a train. He's a sociopathic killer and thief. He would have been hung on the spot...end of movie."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An engaging western which draws much of its success from its well-drawn characters, 3:10 to Yuma is one of the few remakes that has a legitimate claim to being better than the original and is a wildly enjoyable ride."
5,We loved it,My wife and I are in our 30's and we are well educated and and love movie's with a good story. This film was smart and funny and it had good pacing. They need to make more westerns because there are not enough. The acting was great and wow what mean villian. We bought this film right after we rented it. We really enjoyed this and you should too.
2,way overrated,"was ok until crowe and co showed up.his side kicked was such a pansy trying to be a tough guy.i got tired of someone telling someone else to stop talking to wade only for that person to continue talking to wade.i was also lmao @ wade being hand cuffed in front and not shackled at the feet when off of a horse.and the whole bad guy with a conscience was a sham.if i were the director,wade gets shot between the eyes after poking singer in the neck with the hidden fork.roll credits."
4,Better than the Original,"Purchased as a gift, I was invited to dinner and a ""showing"" by my sister in law and thoroughly enjoyed this version. In comparison to the original film starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, this rocks. James Mangold and Cathy Konrad pull and incredible performance from stars Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. Taught, engaging, exciting. A definate must-see."
4,Pretty Good Western,"I'm not much of a fan of westerns. This one was pretty good though. Bale and Crowe both do a good job with it. There are a number of dumb scenarios in it (sitting by firelight while the indians can shoot at them, riding out at night, then camping a few minutes later, etc). Overall it was good."
2,don't waste your money,i can't believe how lame this is... i decided to rent thismovie because of the great reviews and now I'm thinkingthose who gave it a great review must have seen a differentmovie. don't waste your time on this. 2 stars for effort andthat's being generous.
5,Excellent movie,This is an excellent well made movie that draws the audience into it. Its definitely a DVD to buy for your collection
4,Good Action and Good Acting,"Christian Bale and Crowe make good foes and allies in this movie. The movie stretches credulity a bit much when they make a run for the train. Scores of expert gunmen keep missing Bale. I just recently watched the original with Glen Ford. I thought both movies had their strengths and weaknesses, but the ending in the first movie is more plausible than in the remake.Beside the slightly hard to believe plot, all the performances are good. Fonda as the Pinkerton is extremely good. How Crowe verbally engages his guards on the trip is very good. Crowe plays a criminal who is always thinking and playing the angles very well. Bale plays the one-legged rancher trying desparately to provide for his family very well."
4,3:10 to Yuma - FANTASTIC,"This was a great film. Acting by both Bale and Crowe are exceptional. It didn't do well in theaters because I don't think it was given a chance. If you want a great story with character and life, this is it."
4,A character study set in a dangerous place and time,"""3:10 to Yuma"" is a rough, gritty Western that relies as much on the interplay between the two main protagonists (Bale and Crowe) as it does on the Wild West chase-and-shoot sequences to hold your interest. The movie starts slowly, but builds to a shattering climax where you find that nothing was quite as it seemed during the film. You find yourself wondering just what Ben Wade was really thinking as the events progressed, and why he does what he does at the very end. Not quite a great movie, but well-constructed and thought-provoking."
1,changed ending!,anyone who saw the original will be disappointed in the ending. the original had a clever and happy ending; this remake has a depressing ending! beware!
1,not a classic western,"The sound quality and video quality on the blu-ray is very good.What is not fine is the made-for-TV direction of this film. It's pretty clearthat the director is at fault here. James Mangold has done some very good films,but this is not one of them. It's shot like a TV soap opera. It's all close-ups,and the sets and the scenery are completely wasted.Some movies are like that--you can just see the director is framing the entirething for video or for TV. And this is one of those movies. None of the dramaticscenery of a movie like ""Hang Em High"", or ""Unforgiven"", or even ""Open Range"".0And as a story, it's mediocre. Bale and Crowe are greatactors, but they can't overcome bad direction and a weak story. If you likeclassic westerns, you probably won't like this. It's more like a TV cop showfilmed on a western lot."
2,Not up to expectations,"Flawed, cliche-ridden movie with plot holes you could drive the steam train through. And the ending is even worse, leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth and feeling ultimately cheated.The PCM soundtrack rocks on Blu-Ray."
5,3:10 to Yuma,"Great movie, solid acting. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend it. Moves much fater than the original and the location shooting adds greatly."
4,Intelligent western,"Never saw the original, but this remake is very fine viewing pleasure. Intelligent script, and, although there's a lot of blood and gratuitous violence, it seems to be necessary to the story line. The ending run to the train station by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale is the only section that goes over the line toward unbelievability. I mean, dozens of shooters keep missing and missing. Right! It leaves you almost laughing, which is not the desired reaction. Otherwise, Peter Fonda has a nice turn as the Pinkerton man. A lot of suspense here. Worth watching."
3,okay movie,"this movie was okay, not one of the best western i've saw. but still okay. if you like westerns then you'll like this movie."
1,Noble attempt to be an in-depth movie + Outrageously far-fetched ending + Few entertaining moments = Not worth buying,"It tries hard to be an in-depth movie. It deals with psychology, conscience and honesty. There are very few exciting moments. The worst problem is the outrageously far-fetched ending. That has never happenned in history or reality. Logically, it'll never happen either. To me, that makes the film less interesting. It's still worth renting for curiosity."
2,For the beginner,This book is for the beginner and offers no information that cannot be found (for free) on other internet sites. It appears as if the author has written this book to make his methodology clearer to himself and in the process decided to sell it as a book. No earth shattering revelations to be found and definately not enough good quality examples.A bit disappointed in the content but this book will be a good read for an absolute newbie in the field.
5,Perhaps the most beautiful Kiri te Kanawa performance ever,Christopher Hogwood put together some of the most beautiful music from Handel's early operas - and recruited Kiri te Kanawa to sing it in what is one of the most beautiful recordings I have heard in 50 years. That it is not available now is a great crime against music and lovers of Kiri te Kanawa's great voice and artistry.
5,Forefront of 3-D Animation Design,"From 2004's 'The Incredibles' to the great 2006's 'Monster House' & 'Happy Feet' knowledge of LightWave is at the forefront for how-to in spell-binding 3-D Animation. And this book takes you from a basic start to accelerating your own imagination to new heights. Ablan is able to make quite complicated procedures simple and step-by-step understandable. Those who complain may just want results without the time taken to learn. If you have thorough grounding in Photoshop you can do this! Once you follow Ablan's direction you discover your own. A fantastic book, excellent resource as part of your digital design library."
5,As to not make your ego larger Mr. Ablan...,"Having read this book (As thick as it was) in under a week, I thought that it was a very well written technical manual which was very informative in the subject matter at hand. It was direct, clear, and presented in such a way that even if the reader has no concept of 3D designing whatsoever, they would be able to create at least a spinning logo by the time they are done. Definately the best lightwave manual to date! (Newtek, take notes.) Cant wait till Inside Lightwave 8!"
2,Pagan metal,"I was extremely excited when i was given this movie as a gift. I am a huge fan of folk metal, and was surprised to find such a dvd existed. The movie however, was as total letdown. The bands featured were subjected to the most assinine, offensive, and completely irreverent questions possible. Instead of using the interviews and live footage to show what an interesting and talented group of people the narrator got to meet, he seems to use the time to show what an uncultured idiot he is. This movie is a toss up, because there are no other documentaries on folk metal yet, Its cool that it exists, however its painful to watch. If you're interested in seeing talented musicians struggle to answer idiotic questions, this is the movie for you. The only up side is that now that world can see how classy and intelligent the members of the featured bands are in their responses. Seriously, the singer from Primordial has the patience of a saint."
1,A Complex Fate,"This is a bad book. Not because it's written badly - it's not. It's really a good read. But you cannot tell fact from fiction. Barry Sanders was an early Stickley collector and I think this book was written in the 1970s but found no publisher. Now with the craze on all things Stickley it surfaces. His research is dated and in many cases supplanted by much newer information. The footnotes indicate he has read Mary Ann Smith's groundbreaking book Gustav Stickley: The Craftsman and yet he states as fact many things that are the opposite of what Smith writes, and footnotes, in her book. Sanders' research is poor and he does not separate fact from his own speculation in the text. Readers should refer to Smith (though dated) and to Marilyn Fish's continuing series of books for the latest accurate information. Please see my review in the Winter 1999 issue of Style 1900 magazine for more details on Sanders and Fish books."
2,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I love Dean Can Dance! However, nowhere on the album cover (front or back) did it say this was a concert version of previous songs! Imagine the disappointment when I got the album home only to discover songs I already had. I give it 2 stars for the deception!"
5,"Mystical, The vocals are art for your ears! Indulge!","This album is lovely, empowering, and mournful. Some songs encorporate much of our Wersern pop theams, but most of the album is very well written and performed."
4,Pretty good for a 16-year-old,"One of the more fun and innocent teen pop confections of the Britney era (the term ""Britney era"" used for demonstrative purposes only), Billie had a couple of decent hits here, but didn't quite get thrust into the stratosphere. It would have been nice to see that happen, because she does pack some likeable appeal as well as respectable if not extraordinary musical talent."
1,Predictable&boring,Billie sounds just like Britney&the other non-singing Chicks out now.doing very bad Generic New Jack.it's very Soulless&tuneless music.it's The Paula Abdul Hall OF Fame.
1,Advanced prospecting & detecting for hardrock gold,"I can't understand why anyone would publish a 5th edition tech book and not rewrite. Get out of the past, Jim, and join the present."
1,not as good as they say,"Do not be fooled by the glittering reviews. This is not a good book. It tries to be an action adventure murder mystery, set against the theories that jesus had children, and that the crusades were his children's attempt to retake their rightful land. The problems are that it does not develop this theory enough to be plausible (ooh, a secret book explains it) to those new to the field, but offers nothing new to anyone who has read up on this stuff. If you are interested in the theory that jesus had children, read holy blood holy grail. If you have read that then stay away from this book at all costs because you'll be bored. On top that, the fiction portion is as, if not even more, underdeveloped. The characters are wooden at best, and the plot is standard. The other reviewers mention songs, but who cares! If you want poetry read frost. Once again I offer this warning, stay away!"
1,Not that great,"Interesting subject matter, and with all the glowing reviews I expected much more from this book. The ending was a HUGE disappointment, and the characters were not very realistic. I didn't really care about anyone or anything that happened. The songs were distracting, not romantic and inspirational."
3,A nice mystery book,"When I read this book, I must say that I enjoyed it but it was not what I expected! I was looking for a book about the Crusaders and was recommended this book, but this is more of a modern mystery, even if the Crusaders are a part of the mystery! As I said, the book is ok and readers that like mystery-books will probably enjoy this more than me!Regards,/Alex"
4,Nice Portrait of Different Generations,"Alan Hollinghurst's The Spell is, first and foremost, wonderfully written. The author manages, for the most part, to effectively capture different generations (perhaps weakest on the youngest generation) far more than most writers in the gay field. I do not know that it was necessary for them all to be so specatular looking (or at least to their physical beauty to be referred to so often as a part of the narrative). It is the writing, though, that, in the end, will carry the reader through the lives of these four men as they examine and obscure their past, present and future. It is a pleasant read with a satisfying ending."
2,A major disappointment,"A major disappointment from the writer who gave us the ""Folding Star"" which is my favorite book of all times. This is a very boring comedy of manners. The story line and the characters are completely uninteresting. While Hollinghurst is the premier English wordsmith, this book represents a complete waste of his talents."
3,"The natural skin care and beauty cook book: A unique basic course on the care of your skin and hair featuring 240 easy to make,","If you want to make your own skin care products this is a great way to start.The easy to follow recipes are a great way for you to learn how and what affects your skin and hair, which allows you to develop 'a feel' for what will work for you and what does not.Once you've mastered the basic ideas presented in this book, you will probably go on to more complex and indepth books on Aromatherapy, Herbal Medicine etc."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"Hello, The magazine arrived, but it was not as expected. I like to hunt and shoot traditional bows, Recurves and Longbows. I do not want to make my own bow or make my own arrows. I assumed, incorrectly, that the magazine was what I wanted. Completely my fault, but unfortunate. Thanks."
2,Bland,"I picked up this book at the local library a few weeks ago, hoping that as a teenager myself this book would be the answer. But I didn't really find any of the recipes appealing, inspiring, or useful, nor did I find the cutsey designs and blurbs appropriate or pleasing."
5,A real teen pleaser!,"I purchased this book for my picky niece. She loves to cook, so I thought getting her a cookbook written by teens would appeal to her, and perhaps entice her to try some new foods that she made herself. She loves this cookbook! Immediately upon bringing it home she made the fried apple rings (and brought me a sample-yum!). The recipes are easy to follow, appetizing, and the pictures are great. This book makes a perfect gift for the teenage chef in your life."
3,disappointed,A lack of description and unorganized thoghts clutter the undescriptive graphics leaving a viewer disorientated and wishing for more than graphics. The earlier books seem to have more direction and clearity
1,The Worst of the Buffett Books I Have Read So Far,"I have read several books about Warren Buffett and this is by far the worst. It appears to me the author has tried to summarize other writings about Buffett into one book. Save your money and buy ""The Warren Buffett Way"" by Robert Hagstrom and ""Buffettology"" by Mary Buffett."
2,An Oversimplified Account - Where's The Beef?,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have read a great number of books on Buffett and his investing style and this one is the worst. Simmons spends very little time on the calculation of Intrinsic Value and ends up using a formula which doesn't take into account a number of the important factors which Buffett looks at. The formula is a VERY simple one based on only the Return on Equity of the firm and a discount rate. You've got to be kidding me! The case studies are helpful, but once again they are simply explained and gloss over much of what is important. If Bufffett actually invested in the way described in this book noone would have ever heard of him."
4,Well done,It was well done. It makes a great argument that high schools and universities should definitely listen to and apply.
4,Wonderful book,"This book is so delightful. As a city dweller in Manhattan with a large roof deck of my own, I needed some inspiration for growing plants upwards on several trellises I installed. This book was perfect! The designs a gorgeous, and the writer gives you enough information to duplicate some of the marvels. Also, if you love Paris as I do, you'll love daydreaming over the photographs."
3,Another crazy Bigfoot movie.,Just another crazy Bigfoot movie. There has been no proof that Bigfoot is a killer. Hollywood just can't make a good Bigfoot movie.
4,I love this kettle!,"Today I got this kettle.First I wanted to be sure if it whistles like a harmonica.Soon after I took it out from the box, I put it on the stove with about half level of water. Yes, it whistled like an old train. Nicely harmonious sound! I have been looking for this kind of sound from a kettle! Although some people complain about no sound, mine worked very well.This kettle is designed very simple but very beautiful.But the handle is fixed and can't be moved. If this handle were movable, I would give it five stars."
3,It whistles,"As noted by other reviewers, the lid of this kettle whistles but you need to have the right amount of water there (between 3 cups and 1.75 quart). The kettle is pretty small. The handle is fixed. The build quality is fine. However, the handle is too hot to be held when the water comes to a boil. Considering I got it for $20 at HomeGoods, I can live with it."
3,good enough,"This book has great advise but you won't find it until the end after a whole lot of carring on about movies that may relate but really distract from the true concept. If you can get past that, it really is a great book, but personally I found myself skimming over things I'm not interested in hearing again. Although, I have past this book on to other friends because it has great insight about projection and how to deal with such ""vampires""."
3,Not as good as the first.,"Kage Baker's first novel was very good--well-plotted, with a strong main character and a sense of humor. The humor remains in the sequel, but the other elements have weakened. The main character of this novel, Joseph, is not given much to do. He carries out his Company mission, and that's it. The mission itself is not very exciting; they're packing up a village of Native Americans from California to preserve their culture. All in all, there's very little tension or conflict in this novel--Joseph basically does what he's told, and the tribe's removal progresses relatively smoothly.A hint of what could be a much more interesting entry in the series is given in Joseph's references to his mentor Budu. He rebelled against the Company and seemingly got away. Hopefully, the next novel will shed more light on this character."
3,"Really ""from the Ground"" - but not really ""Up""","This book introduces you the really grounds of MFC programming. It explains the basic concepts in a very clear and understandable way. However a bit more advanced or complex topics are either missed out or discribed confusing, impossible to understand from this book (I mainly mean the section about ActiveX Controls). So if you'd like to learn what MFC is, this book gives you a good basic introduction, but if you'd like to get an at least medium level MFC programming knowlegde, - well, try to find a much better publication."
1,False advertising encouraged by Amazon,"I received this from a third party seller. It was not an SACD - as advertised - but a stereo rip-off from some US CD franchise. Seems it was distributed under license from BIS and the seller did disclose this in the 'fine print' but Amazon did not alllow them to sell it with other than the [Hybrid - SACD] tag at the end of the title. So, I don't blame the seller, but buyer beware!"
5,Disney Tinker Bell Motion Wings Watch,"I agree that the wings are on the transparent side and hard to see, but isn't that what Fairy wings look like?It was just what I expected with a Disney watch and I am very pleased. It arrived even quicker than expected. No regrets at all."
5,best album ever,"this is the one of the best rap albums i have ever heard. im dissapointed they did not blow up nationwide. i am awaiting their second album with hits such as ""good girl"" and ""show me you're nasty""they are awesome"
3,some goodies here.,"Yo this cd is banging! ""It's gettin hot"" is a sexy track with a strong beat, definitely doing it up big time. ""The Hype"" is another head banger, catchy beat and it makes you wanna pop it up in ya systems when you is riding. They got a soft track ""Love to Love You"", it's alright not that explosive but it's cool. ""The Cycle"" an in depth ""feel where i'm at"" kinda tune, pretty good. ""EVerybody in the Club"" is somewhat of a dissapointment, kinda weak not that catchy. Overall this cd is pretty good, lyrically it's alright nothing ear captivating but s'all good, I'd still recommend this cd no doubt!"
3,"Excellent Artwork, Poor Writing","This item features some very fine artwork; unfortunately, the writing is truly uninspired and unimaginative hack work. The whole book is basically one long chase scene filled with senseless prattle by the two protagonists. Half thru I was hoping they'd be caught and eaten just to shut them up. Clearly hoping for a sequel, this work ends with nothing resolved.Nevertheless, children 12-15, lacking discriminating taste, may find the book an enjoyable romp thru alternate histories."
3,"Great if you want to learn a little spanish ""here and there""",I thought instant immersion would actually immerse you and TEACH THE LANGUAGE IN DEPTH!! This is fine for travelers who want to learn a little here and there but a serious person who wants to learn the language on the computer - buy something else
3,ok video,This video is OK. Music is not great. He doesn't say much during the video so there isn't much motivation and it can get boring. It is however easy to follow because there is a window that pops on and shows the moves he will do next. The routines are challenging. A good workout...if you don't get bored.
1,Tintin - a product of past thinking,"I was really taken aback to see the view of other cultures represented in this work. At some level, I know that peoples consciousness at the time was less enlightened but it was truly unnerving to see such blatant racism on display. I suppose there was some value there in the historical lesson, even if that wasn't the intent of the author. Awful!"
3,The Adventures of Tintin: Vol. 1Too small for most kids to read.,"""The Adventures of Tintin:Tintin in America/Cigars of the Pharoh/The Blue Lotus"" 3 complete adventures in one volume: Vol. 1: This is a graphic novel, and it's much smaller than the original books. The dialogue balloons are extremely tiny, and it is very difficult to read. My grandson took one look at it, and didn't want to bother trying to read it. You would almost need a magnifying glass to read the words. I was very disappointed. Next time I will buy the regular books."
3,disappointed,"I purchased the Barbie Beach Glam styling Head from Susu Home Center. The product arrived in a timely manner. Although the doll is beautiful, I was VERY disappointed that it is half the size of the doll heads I remember from childhood. This doll needs a stand(which was not included) in order for the doll to maintain an upright position. I would not recommend this doll for a small girl(3-4) because the accessories pose a definite choking hazard.Had I done the research, I would have passed on this product.."
2,Lackluster,"King is substantially weaker than Star, and below the median for Throwing Muses offshoots. It has a couple of okay songs (the title track, and to a lesser extent Red), but the album's lack of critical and popular acclaim is deserved. Try Star or Tanya Donnely's Lovesongs for Underdogs for better stuff."
3,Different,This cd is very unique.. The music is good and some songs u can relate to!My favorite song is puberty! I think u will be amazed by how good this cd really is! My Mom even likes it! u really can't relate it to any other cd. but my personal favs are Godsmack and scream 3 soundtrack!
3,"D's thoughts on ""Filth Pig""","Howdy, this is one of my keystone albums in my cd collection. You're thinking ""then why give it only three stars?"" Well, I'm not completly sold on this one. This cd is going to rub you one or two ways, either you're really going to like it because it's HEAVY and really dense (and I mean DENSE!) or else the thing will bore you straight to death, I flip-flop back and forth between the two when I listen to this. So three stars, it is."
4,classic,"classic minstry . if you are new to ministry filth pig is a good place to start . not too much else a guy can say , i mean it's ministry , their guitars and drums sound like they are tuned to a higher pitch and the trebble is exaggerated they play loud hard and fast .i think the term for this style is industrial ?"
5,HMMM :+),Though not quite as good compared to Psalm(69) it is decent. DON'T be driven away from morons who give it 3-2-1 stars. YOU must buy it. No disappoints.
4,Different but good.,"This album is reminds me of White Zombie ""Astrocreep 2000"" and Jane's Addiction. If you're looking for another ""Psalm 69"" or ""A Mind is a Terrible Thing To Taste"", I warn you, DO NOT LOOK HERE. You'll have a better chance with KMFDM. But if you're looking for something with a heavy bass groove, like most if not all of the tracks on this album, then by all means pick this album up."
2,OK?,"I was a bit disappointed with this toy. It just seemed to be much less exciting than the reviews and description. It is literally a thin plastic ring into which two glow sticks are inserted. We tried throwing it several ways, but it did not impress. I am just puzzled that anyone would find it fascinating. Sorry."
4,Excellent for new to Virginia,"As son was transferred to a suburb of Richmond and knew no one and had no clue as where to go, this book was given as a gift. He has since told me that it provided restaurants to try and places of interest plus locales to find a permanent place to live."
3,Nice concept,"I saw one of these at a motel once and thought it was cool and that the kids would like it (which they do). I ordered two and they both arrived cracked (the plastic dispenser part that holds the cereal) - I sent them back and two more arrived and one of them was cracked (!) - - at that point, I was over it - and my friend took the cracked one for cat food (its plastic so it wasn't dangerous) and I kept the one that was good. Its a great little thing and the kids love it...it does take up counter space though."
5,I LOVE This dispenser!!,"This dispenser is amazing. We keep one side filled with my 5 year old daughter's cereal so that she can get a bowl and make her own breakfast in the morning without spilling cereal all over the floor. The other side has my cereal in it, and it's all I can do to keep my boyfriend out of it while we're making dinner. I'm ordering another one!!"
4,I'm happy,"I'm happy with the cereal dispenser. I'ts easy for my children to use. They love being able to do it themselves. I love not having to pick up all the cereal they use to spill out of the box. They are less likely to waste cereal also because they have better control over the amount they get. Yes, it crunches a little cereal, but for me, the pros far outweigh the cons."
4,A Real Find,"I discovered this book the long way around. I collect children's books and had purchased a book called ""Zarafa"" in that category.It was through its bibliography that I found this book. I would have given this book a full five stars, easily, except for the factthat sentence structure was so often not what it should be that I had to often reread to figure out what it was saying.That said, I believe that I learned more about modern Egypt and surrounding area than in any history class I have taken. I'm prettywell versed in the antiquity's age and the modern era from the Aswan Dam onward. But I knew virtually nothing about those in betweencenturies. So, that was an added benefit to reading this intriguing, heartwarming, delightful story about the giraffeherself.If you are into kids' books - try these alsoZarafa: The Giraffe Who Walked to the KingandA Giraffe Goes to Paris"
1,Anecdotal Hodge-Podge Meanders Endlessly,"I pretty much agree with an earlier, lengthier review in here. Zarafa's story is barely told, and pretty poorly at that. The historical background is interesting, but confusing because much of the information has nothing really to do with the journey. Basically, this would have been a fantastic New Yorker article or historical children's book. I was tremendously underwhelmed and tossed it aside before Zarafa was halfway to Paris."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"More of a gently creeping horror tale, four ordinary people are givenresidence in a building, and all is of course not what it seems. Theresidents slowly discover, via an odd Madame, that maybe they are notactually descending into something scary, but something that is a lotdifferent to that. In general, not that interesting, this book."
4,A Second tier Wolfe book,"This book attempts to adapt the quintessential Gene Wolfe formula by positing several interesting characters around a central mystery. Unforutantely, this is restricted to our world, unlike the fabulous worlds of his varied 'Sun' novels, so his imagiantion is not given free play. Equally unfortunately, he fully explains his vitae idea, a general time traveling back to a pereptually flying ship (which by the way was probably the msot origianl thing in teh book, of using the 300 mph jet stream to glide on. Also includes a tie in to howard hughes.)In brief, this is a book to read after you've finished your Pynchon and Eco."
5,After a long search......................,"I have managed to track this fantastic book down. I read it a few years ago now on loan from a friend. With no cover on the book, sorry fellow book lovers but the girl had travelled with it across Europe and the cover went the way of all well read books, sad but true. I had no memory of the author only the blinding, blazing story line that had me captured from the first page. I think i fell in love with Candy the slightly pudgy ""Escort Girl"", who spends the book munching chocs and delivering some great lines that help to carry the story page after page. Look, enough words, its almost Christmas time, go out and treat yourself to this book, stick it in your stocking, then forget about it till you wake up on Christmas morning, you wont be disapointed, your family may though feel neglected as you wont be talking to much. Enjoy!Colin Gould."
2,Things look different when you're 12,"I consider myself to be a Howard Chakyn fan. I read American Flagg when I was 12 and was blown away. Clever, inventive, violent and cool. Since then though Chakyn hasn't been involved with anything even remotely as cool (maybe the Black Kiss). This book is a lot of nonsense. What's up Chak ?"
3,Predictable,"A fun read, your basic characters, one-dimensional. Situations as you encounter in most romances. Predictable, but humorous and entertaining.The first half was better than the second. I enjoyed the McKettrick books, but believe I prefer Maggie Osborne's western romances for the more complicated stories."
5,High Country Bride,"I liked it all the Mckettrick book are great, there could be more romance but great story lines,they have a long line of series."
5,Wonderful book!,I love most of Linda Lael Miller's books and this book is no exception. I can't wait till the next books about the McKettrick brothers (Kade & Jeb) comes out. This book about Rafe McKettrick is a must read...
4,Cool pictures of the Whale!,"This is a pretty good summary of the changes the A3D went through. (I would like the In- Action series better if the production quality was a little cleaner.)If you ever flew on a Whale you should get this bookAnd if you want to know the meaning of versatility in aircraft design, you could hardly beat a study of the A3 and A4!"
1,"Yeah, Right!","This game sucks ya'all. DON'T BUY IT. Unless you're about 5-10 years old this game is cake. The fires suck, and so does the challenge. I do fire rescue in the real world, this game is nothing like in any way. Bad game!"
4,effective,"as a flight crew member i use this in my lunch box to help keep things cold, it works perfectly for what i need and it never leaks!"
5,Beats Blue Ice bags!!!!,"I have alot of problems with swelling my back, my arms, sometimes my legs. I have arthrites osteo and gout.I used blue ice, seemed so much easier to use, That is untill a blue ice bag got cut up in my chair leverWow!!! what a mess!!!! gooey slimey blue ice all over my chair yuck!!!!I found out these ice bags existed. I LOVE THEM. These bags don't leak their easy to put ice in.Ice is much colder than blue ice.The ice bags are a great way to reduce swelling. The bags will do it without the gooey mess of blue ice messing up your chair should one break.I highly reccomend them I use them all the time. Fast shipping great service AMAZON!!!"
3,Not bad,"Mary Russell is now Mrs Holmes, though still an independant young woman. The only bit I don't like in this series is the religious theorizing, although there is not an excessive amount of it. The story is good, keeps the reader interested. Shows the harmony between Holmes and his wife, without his character changing, or him becoming too demonstrative or affectionate. It makes it believeable that Sherlock Holmes can play the role of a husband."
4,Excellent suspense with Mary Russell & Sherlock Holmes,"This book was a page turner. I loved the suspense of what would happen next. I like Sherlock Holmes books, though not as thrilled about the TV shows. Laurie King kept me enticed to turn the page and I had a hard time putting the book down. The secrets Mary and Sherlock unfold throughout the novel intrigue the curiosity and adventure in us all while teaching us a bit about history. The skill of Sherlock and his detecting are both delightful and amazing. Mary is a wonderful detail companion in the detecting world of Sherlock Holmes. The story unfolds after a friend leaves a historical box with Mary & Sherlock on a visit, which she claims has value - though she does not know how much - and then mysteriously is killed the same day. And the mystery begins as they try to find out who killed her and why over a small box. Now I see why this novel is an Edgar Award Winner. Enjoy the book."
4,Caught off Guard,"I have only done 2 of the 3 DVDs as I had an injury. Today I decided to do the one with the resistance band that came with the DVD. They mentioned tubes on the back of the box, but that is not what it came with. Using tubes with handles make a lot more sense, but it came with a med/heavy resistance band which was not long enough for me to get more then up to my waist and they were moving them overhead and I am 5ft. I do a lot of exercise DVDs and know I have the strength, but the band was very short. I opted to use a heavy one from another instructor and got through the toning workout which was very good. I have yet to do the aerobics one. I like Tom and his crew a lot and he explains well, but it would have been nice to have the right equipment before I started the workout and now don't know where to get it to make the workout better."
2,Worthless at night,"I purchased from a Home Security store($169.00 each). These are worthless at night. One is too dark and the other is too light, like looking into a dense fog bank during the day. Customer service at Swann has been less than acceptable. Long hold times by phone and the website response slow and no help. I am going to junk these and try another brand."
3,swann maxiday/night camera,"Camera worked great color during the day but it is suppose to be beter than the swann buldog according to price and specs for night. It does not preform well at night seems to be to sensitive to any type of background light. The bracket system that came with my camera is not the one in the picture which seems to be a new one from swann, the mounting system I recieved is the old one which needed constant adjustment. I returned the camera"
5,Great camera at a great price,"I use this camera with a 4 camera DVR set-up in a 0 lux environment. Typically I need at least 10 meters of lit area to work with, this camera provides it with no problem. I have used one of these cameras to cover a 30 meter area with great results. The beam pattern is even and covers the entire viewing area, cheaper units have the typical round pattern that doesn't cover the edges. You couldn't do better for the price, plus the additional lens is great!"
5,The view from the floor,"Even Johansen's 2001 masterpiece ""Quiet & Still"" remains one of my favorite albums of all time, so I was quite excited to find out about his new band MAGNET. I was also a little worried that he would change his sound drastically like he did with Libido. REJOICE! Even has definately made one of the best albums of 2004 and it gets better every time I listen to it. Mostly gone is the alt-country that graced alot of the tracks on ""Quiet & Still"". Added to the mix are a bit of subtle electronic sounds & beats and nice swelling strings. Both are a great match for his gentle voice. There is not a bad track on this album, and the US bonus tracks (from UK singles) are superb additions. I can't wait to see what he does next."
3,Don't buy just for Lay Lady Lay,"So I'm sure most are considering this album because of the fantastic song ""Lay Lady Lay."" The truth is, this song is very atypical of the rest of Magnet's work in ""On Your Side."" It's much more of a newer Radiohead meets Coldplay type sound that is very mellow and somewhat experimental in their sound uses. I definitely do not regret purchasing the album, however, I'd recommend listening to the other tracks before jumping in. Some songs, such as ""The Day We Left Town"" are absolutely beautiful, and ""My Darling Curse"" interestingly samples the drum beat exactly from Brubeck's ""Take Five"" (not sure if this is intentional or not). By the by, it's a pretty good album and will definitely grow on you - it took some time to grow on me. So, if you're contemplating the album simply for Lay Lady Lay, buy the single on iTunes, but if you're looking for a mellow/jazzy/ambient album, you'll like the rest of what Magnet has to offer."
2,Nice experiments -- Wrong explanations,"There are some great projects in this book. Unfortunately, many of the ""Analysis"" sections are just plain wrong in their explanation of the scientific principles. For example:""...piece of glass called a prism, which slows down the speed of light."" (p. 29)""...gravity pulls harder the more material there is..."" (p. 77)""Light travels slower in water than it does in air."" (p. 79)There are many, many others.This book is in dire need of a science editor if it ever gets republished."
1,A Jumbled Mess!,"I took three of my children through some of the projects. If I wasn't a machically inclined person so able to adjust their misinformation I would have never gotten through it. My 14 year old son did the project on the cover which doesn't look like the explained project in the book. The one we built was way more fuctional.My 12 year old daughter did the ""Don't be so dense"" project and she managed to get through it but was confused about what their conclusions were.My 9 year old son did the ""get the point"" project and we worked and adjusted so much and spent so many hours making it's known conclusion work that I have been soured from science projects.They did do the projects themselves with a bit of engineer tweeking from me but those books should be clear enough for a child to understand and someone should actually do the projects to see if they work. It's amazing it ever got published. Probably some publishers inept niece."
2,cheap and plastic,This thing does not stay in place. I needed a sponge to prop it up. Also don't let the chrome finish fool ya. It's plastic all around and feels cheap. Right now this is in a box going right back where it came from. No good.
4,"I know that actor, but where did I see him before","If it drives you nuts because you can't remember the name of a show you used to watch or a certain actor's role in a show, this is the book for you. It gives cast listings, a synopsis of every show, and the time it was on the air. It lists the emmy winners, top 30 shows each season, and which shows were based on movies. It's even got primetime schedules! The only drawback is that it only goes up to 2007."
4,Allou need to know - and then some,"The title says it all.This really is a complete reference to every network and cable TV show since 1946 up to the last date for this publication, around 2003.All the favoutites are here that one may care to mention - from West Wing to Dallas, Star Trek to Bonanza, and others you may have forgotten - Gemini Man, AfterMASH anyone?The strengths of this book are in the synopses which are entertaining and informtive at the same time, so this book is more than just a dry listing of information. Also included is an extensive index on such items as longest season runs, Neilsen numbers etc.Highly recommended."
4,More missing shows,"Missing is an NBC show, ""The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" which aired in 1954-1955 (39 episodes, filmed in France) and which starred Ronald Howard, son of Leslie Howard of ""Gone With the Wind"" fame, as Sherlock. H. Marion Crawford played the good doctor. The producer was Sheldon Reynolds. The series has been occasionally shown in the NYC area on PBS channel WLIW. Tapes of the shows are available. It definitely should be listed in the next edition. The shows are classic 50s TV genre."
2,very small print,This is an excelleni book. I received it well within the alloted time limit. However to read the words you should have very strong glasses. The print is very and I mean very small. For content it rates 100%.
5,WORTH READING,"THIS BOOK HAD ALOT OF INFORMATION, YEARS ON TV, ALOT OF SERIES LISTED,REGULAR CAST AND SPECIAL GUEST STARS,MOST HAD A RE-CAP ABOUT WHAT THE SHOW WAS ABOUT,I LIKED LOOKING THROUGH THE PAGES AND READING ABOUT ALL THE PAST SHOWS, THERE IS SOME FUN TRIVIA IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK AND ALL THE EMMY WINNERS.THIS BOOK IS A GREAT PRICE AND I AM REALLY ENJOYING IT."
4,Great Tasting,"I really enjoyed this pasta. To me it had a taste that was very similar to standard pasta and when I used it to make Spaghetti with 3 Cheese pasta sauce, it was awesome. Even my picky children who were not thrilled to see ""no gluten and no wheat"" on the pasta package thought that it tasted really good.Will definitely use this product again."
3,Good Price for Entry Level,"This mp3 player is good for entry level and people who use their mp3 once in a while. The good thing about this mp3 is the SD Card expansion. Sound quality is OK. The earphones need improvement. I used this with my $30 Sony earphones and the sound quality is the best. I guess they expect you to buy a better earphones. The controls button are small, but OK and same as any mp3 player of this size. Don't expect the Ipod experiences from a cheap mp3 player like this. Good for beginner / entry level."
5,review for Head on movie and Musik,"Head-OnThis is a great masterful German/Turkish movie I even watched the dvd out-takes, Diertors cut, Etc. all that stuff offerred on all dvd but never watch. The actor Birol Unel has the intensity of an actor who has been around awhilr though I had never heard of him. I did see it recieved many awards as it should. The story itself is like halfway thru you are in a totally different place, sound, andsituation NO i am not going to give away the movie but, along with the excellent soundtrack, you must see it. Definatly 5 star...Cheryl A Paxton"
3,Avarage record,"He plays fine and the band does as well. However a bit to ""nice"" and thus a bit boring. Especially when comparing the alternatives from the period, the style, the set-up and the instrumental colleauges available.The 4- 5 star reviews are definitely out of range."
2,Disappointed,"I'll be honest, the main reason I bought this was for Mary Woronov and for the VERY short time she was in it she was good as usual. The plot, what there was of it could have been very funny but there were so many missed oppurtunities. The lighting was unflattering and the script lacked any consistency. I was very disappointed because I could see that deep down there was a great movie waiting to be made."
2,Rubs off much too easily,"I bought this to use for a craft project. It looked great on the brass that I sprayed it on, but rubbed off on my fingers as soon as I picked it up a couple of hours later. It might work better on automotive paint, but I wasn't impressed with its performance on bare metal. I will say it washed off easily enough with soap & water."
4,Madonna:Mary in the Catholic Tradition,Very informative. A bit more like a textbook than I expected. I was looking more for a good read.
4,FUn for the whole family,"Got this for my daughter (age 8) for the holidays. It wa a big hit on X mas day for the whole family, sitting around having a ball. Some take it more seriously than others. But whatever you level of expertise this singing game is both FUN , histerical (when you are with the right crowd) and definitly encouraging for the hard core karaoke singers. Whether you sing for the fun of it or take it in seriousnous, you will enjoy this game.."
4,Awsome Game,"This is a really fun game.The micophone is flaless and the pitchlines are very hepful.If you are Karaoke Revolution dreamer thanthis game is for you.You can choose your character,costume,nickname.You sing at your friend`s party,to a famous superstar.I lovethis game!"
5,A Great Reference For Marshall Enthusiasts.,"This book does a great job of covering all of the bases that make up Marshall amplifiers. The provision of schematics is really helpful in troubleshooting and just seeing how the amp works. The color section is a joy to look at, and the reprinted catalogs are as well. A great book at any price."
2,The History of Marshall,"Since there are no OTHER books out there dealing with the Marshall amplification history this one will just have to do..for now. Sporting no glossary, and with more pictures and poorly reproduced schematics than relevant tonal references, I found myself searching time and time again for some clue as to the legendary tonal qualities associated with the individual models. None were given really. I was hoping for some help in trying to select a new or vintage Marshall amp and I couldn't find it here. There is far MORE INFORMATION available on the internet than is compiled here in this book. Copyrighted in 1993 this book NEEDS TO BE UPDATED, it's now 15 years out of date. For $33.00 I could have done without this book..although I do like looking at the pictures."
2,Could have been much better,I was disappointed in this book. Not what I expected. Although very basic it lacked the detail I expected such as a more in-depth write on Jim Marshall's life and the pictures of the actual artists which use Marshall Amplifiers weren't sharp.
4,Bird's Eye View,"This guide is really nice...it is very helpful if you are going to Australia, or you just want to learn about the birds there for personal enrichment.Very pleased with it!"
5,Fun summer read,"I'm not a huge YA chick lit fan, but I really enjoyed this book. The story is about a teenage girl from California named Jazz (short for Jasmine--she is half Indian) and her summer vacation at an orphanage in India. Jazz's mother was adopted at a very young age from the orphanage by American parents and wants to go back to find out more about her roots. Jazz is initially reluctant to travel to India because she has to leave behind her best-friend/crush Steve, but she eventually comes around. The story is sweet and the main character is likable from the get-go. The author does a great job of showing India from an American teenager's perspective (having gone to India myself as an American teenager). The ending was a little too optimistic to be believable but at least it was a happy one (phew!), which is almost essential in these kinds of books. I would highly recommend this as a fun summer read."
1,"It's time to call it quits, boys.","Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed the first two Jerky Boys CDs and much of the third. By the time the fourth CD rolled around, the schtick was getting tired and the pranks went from funny and silly to rude and stupid.Now, the Jerky Boys have unleashed their fifth CD: ""Stop Staring At Me."" This CD is just the pits. There's not even one or two good tracks. Skip it."
3,Worth the purchase,"Given it is not the best compilation but masturbation box is hilarious so is super gay you will laugh! If you are a fan you should have it in your collection, I have every album and I listen to all of them worth the amount of money. You will laugh.Send a salami to a boy in the army thats what they say!"
5,other people lie,"This game is awesome. It is realistic. The guy who said he couldnt crash didnt look at the realism settings. Everyone who complained about the requirements is right. I had 500 mhz and 128 ram and 8mb graphics card. It worked terribly untill i got a new computer. 2.66ghz,512ram, and 128 graphics card. It works great. A better computer wouldnt do much better. Triple the minimum requirements and if your computer doesnt make it dont buy fs2004. With this simulator, not a game, you can downdload other planes off simviation.com. You better have a joystick if you are going to play this game. It just need to have a throtle. The new aircrafts are annoyings but this game is still great."
5,best sim so far,"I OWN TWO PREVIOUS VESIONS MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 95,98 AND NOW 2004 A CENTURY OF FLIGHT.IN MY OPINION MICROSFT HAS DONE A BETTER JOB WITH THE 2004 VERSION,MORE AIRCRAFT TO FLY A REALY GREAT FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR ROD ,IMPROVED ATC,ONE THING THOUGH LETS HOPE THAT WHEN 2006 COMES OUT(IT'S ALL HUSH HUSH AT MICROSOFT HQ)THAT THEY WILL AT LEADT ADD NEWER AIRCRAFT MY FAVORITE BIENG THE AIRBUS A321 WHICH I FLEW TO EUROPE ON,AND THE CITATION X BY CESSNA."
2,Many Problems,"Flight Simulator 2004 has too many bugs on its roll out. I would suggest waiting a while before you purchase FS2004 especially if you own FS2002. The software development team used the same old tired panels that have been used since FS2000 and before. The work seemed to go into the new aircraft ie, Wright Flyer etc. If you have FS2002 and have updated panels from the base set of aircraft you will be very disappointed to go back to the Jurasic era panels. Microsoft really needs to pay attention to what is out there as 3rd party addon's for instance Paul Goldings panels and aircraft.General advice wait 3 to 4 months before buying by than Microsoft should have solutions to most of the problems once enought people beta tested it for them."
4,Good choice for young learner,It is highly recommended for young players especially who are starting this game. The finish is very soft and comfortable on young hands.
3,Giggle Physics!,"The graphics on this game really don't hold up with age. But It's interesting to see where this franchise got it's roots. So for nostalgia's sake it's worth getting. The DOA games have always been about the Boobs, and these games have a comical amount of boob bounce; or as I like to call it Giggle Physics (GigglePhys). It's good for a laugh, or some juvenile entertainment, but not much more than that. If your looking for more depth in DOA games, you simply will not find it. The only improvements this franchise makes with time is with graphics and GigglePhys. The story mode is just plain stupid, but then again, what fighter ever had a decent and logical story? You're not buying it for that anyway."
1,This game is horrible unless your into bouncing boobs:,"I've played all of the Dead or Alive games and found that they lack everything but boobs and girls. Sure there are guy ninjas like the awsome Hybusha but that's really the only reason I kept the game. Sure I like girls, but come on, i buy a fighting game to play a fighting game. Oh about the fighting physics they suck. You can about counter every freakin move. I used Hybusha for a few days and I beat a Super rank gamer on DOA online, how pathetic. The graphics are all that seemed to please the eyes except for B-factor. Anyways When it comes down to it, matrial art fighting is way better than this, To me this is horrible tekken clone that diserves to be put down for good, DOA 4, a clone of this game with more characters, whooo who cares. Anyways if your looking for a awsome fighting game pick up the best, Soul Caliber II or if you like Tekken buy Tekken 5, but please save yourself the money and dignity skip this one..."
2,Retraact-it. Retract this!,"This came with the wrong bracket, also very flimsy. Also. Last time I buy heavy stuff online."
3,a bit flimsey,"I think it is great fun to look at, but I have found it to be a bit more flimsey than I thought it would be. When I ordered the stainless steel model, I assumed it would be quite sturdy...not so much. Regardless, I use it daily. I hope it will hold up to long term use."
5,A Fresh Approach to Sports Psychology,"Having read several sports psychology books - Rotella etc. - I found ""On The Sweet Spot"" to be refreshing and provocative. Keefe marries sports performance with the science of the brain in an instructive and memorable manner. This is not a traditional ""how to"" book that reviews the standard steps such as ""pre-shot routine"" - I am sure that Keefe felt that those topics have been covered effectively by the existing body of work. Instead it probes deeper into the mysterious interaction between the self, the brain and spirituality.This is not a casual read, it demands thinking and reflection - but ultimately delivers a compelling message."
5,Great music about the pain of love.,"After hearing Somebody's Crying and Graduation Day many times on the radio and TV I finally got this CD. I was afraid that the rest of the songs on Forever Blue might not live up to my expectations. As I discovered there is a lot more to this album than the two songs that were released. The songs stay true to the theme of the album's title, Forever Blue. This CD is great to listen to when you are feeling a little blue yourself, especially if your troubles are related to love. Chris Isaak's lyrics are so true you might think he is singing about your life. Forever Blue and Shadows In A Mirror are incredibly sad but so good that you just have to listen to them. In my mind this is one of the better CDs in my collection, I only wish the lyrics to all the songs were included in the linear notes. Nevertheless I highly recommend this one, just be warned it might make you cry."
4,Nice Mellow Album,"I really enjoyed this album - Chris Isaak has a very sexy voice, and this is a great album to wind down to. However, it isn't a heavy rotation album for me - I like to listen to it once in a while. Certainly worth purchasing, however."
4,fairly nice for a kids watch,"My wife is a big fan of Little Mermaid and half jokingly said she wanted an Ariel watch for Christmas.If you want Micky, Minnie, Tinkerbell, Winnie or the 3 princesses, you're in luck - their easy. Ariel, for adults anyway, is darned hard to come by. This was the ONLY decent Ariel watch I saw. Even then, I had to buy a new band for it as this is a kids watch. As for the watch, it really is a nice looking watch and if you put a ""real"" band on it, you'd never know it was a kids watch. Anyway, she liked it and I'm a hero."
5,great item,We purchased this for our five year old daughter. The quality was better than we expected for the money and she absolutely loves it.
4,margarita's galore,"we bought this book after we ate at Maria's Mexican restraurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Interesting to read all the different recipes and try some new drinks."
2,"Same old, same old","I had a thought about writing a Margarita recipe book. I went to Mexico to see the Tequila-making process and taste each and every type of Tequila manufactured.Or so I'm told.Later, when I woke up at home, I was disappointed to find there was already a very nice-looking Margarita recipe book. I keep the book on hand, as a kind of joke. It opens with some history, then a classic, uncompromising, margarita recipe. Turning the page, one learns that a Margarita can, in fact, be made with a different Tequila and orange liqueur altogether! Each and every recipe is exactly the same; only the brands of Tequila and liqueur are changed, to protect the innocent. If you want a book where you can find an identical, genetically purebred Margarita regardless of which page you open to, this is the one to get. Heck, get two dozen identical copies. Your sense of whimsy will not be lost on me."
4,. . . 'til my daddy takes the t-bird away,"This is possibly one of the most fun games I've ever played. I just started playing it a couple of hours ago and I'm totally hooked. I wish you could have 2 people going head-to-head that's not using the x-box live component, but I can totally live with the way the game plays now. Wow!!!"
1,Sent Me The Wrong Book!,"Instead of sending me ""Forensics: The Winner's Guide to Speech Contests"", they sent me ""Duped America."" Yep....I was duped alright."
1,So So,"I don't know who reviewed this book before, but it's not worth more than 1 star, and I think that was generous. A friend loaned this book to me after I expressed interest when I saw it at their house. Despite her warning I read it with my children anyway and was very disappointed."
3,I should have paid more attention to the size.,"I don't know what I was thinking, I thought this was a larger plate than it is. It's ok, though. I can find uses for it, and the price was still great."
5,Joshua in the holy land,The book came on time and in very good shape. I will enjoy it thank youhaving this as a hard book will make it nice to keep
5,Secret Weapons Fun and Challenging,"I am not your typical gamer being retired and only occasionally delving into game playing. I really enjoy Secret Weapons Over Normandy. I find it very entertaining, and it's a challenge for my skill level which apparently isn't that great. Before buying the game, I read some reviews and a few indicated that it was rather easy to play through all the missions. I guess you wouldn't want me in your squadron as I am frequently killed in action before completing a mission! Besides just being a fun experience, I find the overall layout of the game quite good. The graphics are fine, various noise levels are pleasant and not annoying, and there are extras like news clips with commentaries that add to the overall experience. You should be able to purchase this game used for under $10 and I would say that's a good buy considering the many hours of aerial combat that you will enjoy. I don't have any other aerial combat games so I can't provide any comparisons."
4,Love it!,"This game is personally my favorite. The scare factor on this game isn't the looks of the ghosts, but the tension. The walking in to a room and not knowing what is waiting there for you. I personally like the game, because of the settings. Which are beautiful. There are a few things that annoyed me about the game, first and foremost is Mayu. She is seriously irritating as you attempt to make your way through the game, being as you constantly have to wait for her to catch up. The repetitive nature of some of the ghost. I really dislike how many of the ghosts actions repeat themselves. (Such as when the lady falls fom the landing.) But all and all this game is fun and is truely scary, I have friends who won't stay in the same room when I'm playig. But I recommend this, ONLY if you believe in ghosts^^"
3,A game I can't even play...,I bought this game about a month ago and it is so scary I can't even play it. I make it about ten minutes into the game and I have to turn it off. If you are easily frightened it may be in your best interest to save your money. Had I know it was going to be as scary as it is I would have not have bought it.
5,Ridiculously Scary,"Right now I'm playing Silent Hill 1, Silent Hill 3, Resident Evil: Code Veronica X, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Outbreak, and this game is by far the scariest game I've EVER played. I actually have to take breathers before walking into a room, I literally scream as if I'm actually seeing ghouls, I get scared in the dark after playing, and I question myself why I even play this, it's that scary. If you decide to buy this beware of playing by yourself, there's a warning on the back of the box about this, take it seriously. I also have Fatal Frame 3 but haven't yet played it. If you're really looking for an amazing horror game you've fatal fallen across the right one."
5,Deep song,"Zelia Barbosa sings these protest songs of the early sixties with a depth of feeling both sorrowful and evocative - unlike other interpretations, including those by the artists that wrote them. The recording is not overproduced, which only adds to the sense of the music being 'real', not a producer's dream of how to sell hits. Drums crash and guitar strums as Barbosa moodily evokes the suffering of down and out people, and though there are brighter songs, the dark tone pervades most of the album. If you're looking for early bossa music that steers clear of the cheesy arrangements and fey vocalising, this album is for you."
5,Grandma Heart Pendant,This was agreat value and an outstanding product. My wife has enjoyed from the minute I gave it to her.
2,not as described,"would have been nice to know there was a big crack in the dispenser, that is noticable. item was not clean, would think twice before ordering from this person again!!"
1,Too big,"Too big, couldn't find where to put it in the kitchen. It wouldn't fit anywhere, so I returned it."
2,could live without it,"Not quite as sturdy as I would like. Would not allow children to use it. Can't use it for large clump cereal like granola. Caps on the bottom of the dispenser are hard to get on. All in all, if I had purchased it at a store I would return it."
4,Good for the price.,This product makes eating cereal easier and a little cooler. It seals cereal well. I haven't had stale cereal with this unit. It does have one major problem though. The plugs that seal the bottom where the cereal comes out are made of rubber. As you know rubber can lose its shape with time. After about a year with this product the rubber has become loose and easily pops off with the slightest touch. I have feeling I'll need to replace it eventually. So these will probably need to be replaced after a few years in my experience. But they work great until the rubber seals give out.
2,Waste of Money,"This really looks like a nice item, if it only worked as well as it looks. We have tried cereal and snack. Most cereals just get ground to dust as you turn the handle, and most snacks get stuck in the wheel. You have to turn left and right in hopes of getting something edible out.Save your money."
4,"Good, doesn't draw as well as individual but lasts longer",We found this to be good in that it is harder to eat/break and the colors last quite a bit longer than the regular bathtub crayons. we've had one for two months and it still has plenty of crayon left. Our other crayons all fell apart within couple of weeks.
3,overpriced,"The picture in the ad makes this appear much larger than it really is. My son enjoys it and it holds up better than most tub crayons, but it is way over priced for its size. I probably would not purchase it again just because of the price."
3,Too good,These crayons were well received by my 3 and 4 year old children. They are easier to use and write better than the crayola ... But too well. They lasted for 4 baths because the kids drew so much - they just turned out to be too expensive.
2,Not so great,"After reading all of the reviews, this seemed like the best bath crayon choice. But...it takes FOREVER to scrub off of the bathtub. Maybe we just have an old one, but I say pass on this crayon. Plus, I couldn't find any safety information about it, leading me to be even more suspicious."
4,Use of imagination,"Most toys nowadays don't leave room for the imagination.This is a great wooden toy with which someone can build all kinds of marble runs. It is better for kids 5 and up as the wooden blocks move out of position easily and it doesn't work very good on carpet. My daughter played with it for a while, but now she is bored with it, but I'm sure that she will get it back out soon (as she rotates her toys).The paint started to chip of after only a couple of uses.A special sack with it to store it with would have been great.It comes with a couple of marbles. You can also play with it with other blocks."
1,Very poorly written,"Maybe there is a pony in here but it is not worth digging out of the pile. The writing is absolutely terrible - dozens of words where few would have served. It reads like a bad high school paper. ""Of course"" is in every other run-on sentence, between extraneous parentheticals. It is an academic version of ""like, you know, whatever"" - insufferable."
4,long & boring,This is interesting if you are really into Asian history but it is a long drawn out affair. Many of the names are hard to remember as you jump from one era to another.
4,is good,"is a good product with good quality, I use a lot to keep order in the kitchen with me works fine grains"
3,not thrilled,i was disappointed to find it such lightweight plastic. it looks very nice-which in my kitchen is more to the point. i thought it looked cool. even when full of cereal it is somewhat unstable when in use. the twist off cap on the dispenser is awkward to maneuver. the price was right.im not hard to please. it kinda took the fun out of it for me...it feels cheap to me
2,"Indeed, it was BORING","The theory behind this book is good, but, boy is it DULL. As another reviewer stated, it does hook you in the beginning, but then continues on with nonsensical poetry and meaningless tales. Once I got to the correspondence between Ash and LaMotte, I didn't know if I could make it through. I finally skipped the whole section, as well as most of Sabine's journal because poking my eyes out seemed like more fun. However, I'd already invested that much time in the book so I had to finish it. Interesting tale. Maybe someday it will follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride and publish the ""good parts version."""
4,"A good read, but a little boring in between.","AS Byatt is undoubtedly a gifted writer, what to make up poetry by two poets so convincingly in addition to the narrator's voice in this book. It's a great story, but readers be warned: it does get very difficult to read at times, what with pages of poetry that one much read through to decipher clues about characters and their motives. Perhaps it's because I am reading it on a Kindle; I find it much easier to absorb books in actual book form. Still, it got quite exciting as the story moved on. Worth a read...don't give up during the earlier portions!"
3,Clever Book,"This book is very clever academically - complex plot, layers of meaning etc. If you don't usually read poetry, you might find yourself skimming through these sections of the book. I found most of the characters not very believable or appealing - particularly the modern day group. However, it was interesting and mentally stimulating so worth the read."
1,Hopelessly boring,"Hmm...how best to describe this book? Dull. Dull. Sleeper. Boring. Dull. Take my advice: don't read it. It hooks you in in the beginning (however slight that hook may be) but then it drags on FOREVER. It's hard to follow, and you read about 100 pages total of useless junk and letters...blah blah blah. Don't waste your money on such a worthless, sugary, boring book."
1,This book drags!,"I was very excited to read this book after being taken in by the book jacket but finally gave up after getting to page 150. I desperately wanted to like this book, and finish it. Although, I found aspects of the book intriguing (the letters) and the writing was very descriptive, the story dragged. I was going to stop around page 75 but forced myself to continue. There are much better books out there like ""The Sun Also Rises""-Hemingway."
1,Overstated,"A.S. Byatt is obviously a gifted writer and intellectual. I enjoyed her ability to convincingly write in the ""voice"" and varied style of her different authors. My problem is that I could care less about any of her characters and the development was painful and slow. I am sorry to say that this book is clearly for those literary intellectuals. Not for everyone. My blessing to those who love it."
3,Long and difficult read.,"Unless you're really brilliant and know all kinds of history and love difficult reads about writers who are brilliant and love history, this book is not for you. I bought this after seeing the movie. Though the story itself is fascinating and compelling, getting there is quite a trek. Some of it is magical, however, but be prepared for digging in and holding on."
4,New country,"Erika Jo has something of the most famous voices although she sounds ""modern"". I love the songs, music and lyrics, but I confess that I got fond of Erika Jo as soon as I heard her. Listen once and you understand why, like a spell..."
3,Its not bad! But shows its age,"Back in the day i would of likely called this a slightly Clumsy Metal gear. The two characters play different the one Tenchu style, Shes a Ninja with plenty of toys, A grapple and such. The other character i felt more at home with, Using fire arms and gadgets felt very Solid Snake in a way.While fun the game shows its age with a clumsy stealth system, Level design was nice but lots of repeats since both characters end up going thru many of the same places, More than once even.Overall its not bad! If you love Psx and ps2 genre action games, This might be up your Ally."
2,Could Have Been Better,"The book (entitled Binary) was great, suspenseful and kept me reading. In fact, while I was reading it I kept thinking it would make a great film. Then, while surfing through Amazon's recommendations based on my previous purchases (I had purchased Coma and The Great Train Robbery - both are good solid films directed by Crichton) I saw this. Due to the DVD case art I was expecting a great movie. I was unfortunately disappointed with both the acting and script. It almost makes me sad that Crichton, himself, directed this. The story is good and could make a great movie. This is one of those that I wished Hollywood would adapt and set in the present day. It would make a good thriller.My advice, skip the film, but read the book."
4,Sweetie Awo is Back!,"For those of you who missed the first book in the Sunbeamy Kids series, here is an opportunity to catch Sweetie Awo fever. Miss Flora A Trebi-Ollenu has outdone herself with her second book ""Sweetie Awo Goes to Boarding School."" The star of her series is now facing new challenges and gets a taste of boarding school due to changes that have occured in her family. This book is a page turner as it is interesting to join Sweetie Awo on her first experience in boarding school."
3,Good but not great,"These headphones definitely do a good job of blocking out any unwanted external noises. While it's not noise-cancellation, it does get pretty close. The in-ear buds can get a little gross, but with care, this problem can be mitigated.I really liked that Shure supplies several different sized earplugs to fit your ear, as well as ""earwax filters"" that prevent earwax from travelling into the innards of the headphones.On the downside, the dynamic range of the headphones isn't quite as great as I expected. Bass is a little bit weak, but if you are a casual listener like me, and not some major audiophile, this should not be a major problem."
2,Not for use while running,"I bought these earbuds for my IPod for use while running. They sound great while they remain in your ear, but keeping them in your ear is the problem. The large foam inserts only remain in your ear only for a short time; that is until you build up a sweat. Once you start to sweat, the buds will no longer securely fit in your ear and will slide right out.I'm back to using my lousy IPod earbuds again."
4,I like 'em.,"Very good sound. 1/2 star off for awkward positioning of wires & shortness of individual leads. 1/2 star off for the actual earplugs - the seal is SO good that body sounds (swallowing, coughing, etc.) tend to overwhelm the sound from the earphones (which is just how this kind of earphone works, I suppose)."
2,"OK fit, limited frequency response","These are solid little buggers with a nice thick cord and hard plastic transducer housing. Shure could stand to include rubber sleves that are yet one size smaller than the ones included, but I manage a decent fit despite my apparently small, shallow ear canals.The freq response is limited, very mid-rangey with a sharp drop-off on the high- and low-ends. As stage monitors, these are probably briliant. For Hi-Fi listening, these leave a lot to be desired-despite the claims on the packaging. Shure doesn't even publish freq response specs for these, so you know they're hiding something.I compared these to an $8.00 pair of Teac standard earbuds, and the difference was astonishing- clear, airy highs and enough bass to satisfy my orchestral music needs. These Shure's had none of that, a trade-off, I suppose, for the sturdy construction and noise isolation aspects."
3,"Good sound, lots of plug options, short life","These are very good sound isolating headphones when they work. I like the over the ear design of the units and how they fit inside the ear canal. With plenty of options and sizes almost anyone will be able to find a good fit. They really do a good job of passively blocking out the outside noise. I like that because I don't need to crank the volume up all the way on the MP3 player.The main problem with the headsets and some subsequent iterations of this model is the poor quality of the cords. I'm on my 3rd unit in 3 years and this cord just went after 9 months of use. Good thing for Shure's 2-year warranty, because you'll probably need it. The good news is that the support service is fast & responsive. But you kind of don't want to deal with that on a $70+ item."
4,2nd Pair I Bought!,"This is the second pair of Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones I bought. After several years of use, I ruined the first set by inadvertently cutting the wire. These are nice headphones. Good sound, good fit, good build quality (nice heavy wire), AND good price. I particularly like the moldable foam earpieces (included) that once compressed, will form fit to your ear canal. I routinely use these when I am exercising....doing yard chores..etc. I have to say that when I'm cutting the grass for example, the earpieces just about cut out all of the mower noise. If I had to give any critique, it would maybe be that the bass may be a bit lacking at times, and an earpiece has cut-out once or twice during periods of increased exercise ..and I would assume because of sweat getting into the ear-piece."
2,Dumbstruck by all the positive reviews,"I read a lot of positive reviews and only a few negative ones before deciding to try the shure E2c earphones. Unfortunately, no matter which size or type of sleeve I tried, the sound quality just wasn't very good. While I found the medium size soft and flex sleeves to be the best fit to get any bass, the bass wasn't particularly rich. The overall sound was still rather tinny even in the best of orientations. They also weren't very comfortable. My two-year-old Sony earbuds (MDR-EX51) were less than half the cost and have better bass response. Speaking of response, I can't even find those specs on the shure website, although they should be glaringly obvious when you choose to view the product specs. So, for all of you who love these earphones, enjoy them, as they just did not work for me at all. Needless to say I returned them."
1,Good drivers killed by cheap and nasty cable.,"Basically owned these for 3 months when the plastic covering on the cables began to crack, not only making them uncomfortable but then eventually the audio began dropping out. I think part of it is even caused by the travel case they supply. Just comes down to some engineer or product manager picking the wrong cable supplier probably just because it was .01 of a cent cheaper than some decent cable.Drivers were good. They're not the best in the world but they're good enough for listening to Mp3s and also make flying a bit more bearable.Shure's service also sucks since you need to mail it to them and in an email they said that the cable deterioration whilst being a known issue is likely my fault, so not to expect them to cover costs. Just makes you feel that it's not worth paying the premium when your mp3 player is edging closer to the same price."
3,"Keeps external sounds out, but poor sound qualtiy","Overall these headphones do a great job keeping external noise out (I was vacuuming and couldn't hear it running), but the sound quality is really poor for the price. Bass is non-existent."
2,Difficult to wear,"I found these headphones difficult to wear because I couldn't find a good fit with the ear pieces provided. The black mushroom style plug was the only fit that seemed to produce he bass that made the sound decent and because I had to push them so far into my ear, it became annoying after a short time. If you don't mind something pushed into your ear snuggly enough to allow the sound to come through, then these work fine. I guess I prefer something that isn't so snug. For the price, I will be looking for another model that works better for me."
4,"Excellent isolation, precise sound","The included ear fittings seem ugly to some, the ear pieces difficult to put in at first but the sound is exactly as described - clear, precise and most external noise is drowned out. The bass levels are a bit dim, no rocking of the ears with heavy drivers, so they are probably a better fit for pop, classical, jazz and instrumental rather than percussive, hip-hop and electronic music. Interestingly, when I plugged these into my pc at work (a run-of-the-mill dell desktop) I got slight noise from the motherboard being transmitted across the sound card. This would probably be inaudible with any other speakers or headphones, but with these clear drivers, you'll spot any flaw, crack or poorly encoded mp3 file instantly. Overall, worth the money."
2,Small size = small bass,"The E2c sounds good for an earbud, but in fairness the praise ends there. Earbuds just can't match the low end sound of a larger headphone--even the inexpensive types. Other variables held constant, a bigger speaker accompanied by a stronger magnet will increase bass response. I prefer the overall sound from my $45 titanium driver headphones from Radio Shack.The E2c is not ""noise cancelling"" it is noise isolating--just like the earplugs you get from the drugstore. I hate to say it, but this product is really just a hybrid ear plug/ear bud. Really, there is not $99 worth of product, technology, or even clever idea.If you're an ear bud fan, you'll like these (as other report, they sound good for what they are). However, if you're the type to trade some convenience for superior sound, I suggest you pass on all ear buds."
4,Great Sound - a little tricky to fit,"I'm still trying the different earpieces to find one that fits properly and is comfortable for the hour or so that I usually use them - so far the foam ones are the best, but they are a little scratchy. Hwever, when the fit is correct the sound is very good - I am hearing new elements of music I've been listening to for years. Because of the sound isolation I can listen at lower volume levels and still hear clearly.On sale for $39 these were a great buy."
1,Bad insulation,"These earphones have a nice sound, but they use inferior insulation in the wires. The wires are stiffer than I expected and maintain their shape around the ears. While not a problem in using them, the isulation cracked and broke a few months after the warranty expired causing the sound to go in and out in one of the earpieces. This happened despite the fact that I treated the earphones very gingerly throughout their lifetime. Shure service was very unsympathetic and wanted almost as much to fix the problem as the earphone cost in the first place. If you purchase these earphone, don't expect them to last very long."
5,Fabulous!,"Couln't live without them! I recently took them to a pro soccer match with 20,000+ fans in attendence and they were able to silence the entire crowd! Excellent clarity, very comfortable, and compact and transportable. Perfect."
3,"Good, but not for everyone.","I have used the Shure E2c daily for two months now and the sound quality in a noisy environment is more than acceptable, however, my ear canals are apparently smaller than normal and after continued use (thursday and friday of a normal work week), the smallest black ear rubbers still make my ears hurt because they are still too big to fit comfortably. They are more durable than my Etymotic ER6i's because of the remote driver design (tunnel feeds sound from external large driver into the ear canal) and there are no filters to replace. For critical listening the ER6i's are superior, though."
3,So-so,I bought the earphones solely to listen to the movie/music aboard long distance flights. Sound quality is comparable to the earphones supplied by the airline. The sound isolating feature depends on how tightly the earphones are fitted to the ear. Earphones come with a selection of different side adapters to match different ear sizes but finding the adapter tight enough to both isolate sound and to not fall out when moving your head is a nuisance particularly when squashed into economy seating.
3,good for noisey jobs like mowing the lawn,"I have had these earphones for a few weeks now, and I would recommend anyone that has not used in your ear phone types before to give yourself some time to use them. When I first got them I didn't like them. I found them uncomfortable and the sound quality just decent not great, but that didn't really matter so much to me since I really only got them to use for mowing the lawn. Prior to this I had a huge pair of Koss over the ear headphones, and decided to try a pair of headphones that were a little less ridiculous looking when wearing. After a few weeks however I have gotten used to them and find them reasonably comfortable and the sound quality pretty decent for a pair of headphones that really do well at cutting out load sounds. I still will say I don't think I will ever use them as my main headphones, my Koss KSC35 simply have better sound and are much more comfortable, but for load environments they are great."
3,Not exactly pleased with the sound quality,"I've been using these for a trip on a plane...the earbuds work as earplugs fine...but the actual sound quality is not up to par IMO. I've fitted them and put them in different angles, but the bass response has still been less than optimal and there is some phase problems...probably expected from their bottom of the line series. I'm kind of wishing I had bought the B&O ear buds because they seemed better but were slightly more expensive."
2,The cord sucks,"I've had these for a couple of years and the sound for me is great, made me remember what my music should sound like. But the biggest complaint that I have is, and this is why I gave them 2 stars, that the cord on my right ear where it bends at the top, cracked in cold weather and I had to electrical tape them, then the next winter the left ear cracked and I have hade to do the same again, which makes for them being a bit uncomfortable on top of the ear. Plus if you where glasses the cord seems to not want to fit that great over your ears. I'm going to try the new version of the Bose earbuds and see if the review of those are true."
2,Ear PLUGS not ear buds!,"I, too, was taken in by the Shure name. Selecting buds (there are about 5 styles that come with the E2c) is critical because you're not selecting something that comfortable fits outside your ear, but rather selecting something to go IN your ear, snugly. Too snugly.Let me be absolutely clear: These must be seated in the ear canal with an absolutely perfect seal, much like a hearing aid. If the seal isn't perfect, ALL the bass goes away, the tone changes, and they sound like a tiny AM radio. Yuck. Again, when they're shoved in the ear canal, they sound great - if you can stand the feeling of something akin to industrial ear plugs.The only reason for 2 stars, rather than one, is that the sound is good if they're shoved in far enough."
2,"Good sound, faulty construction","I purchased my pair of E2Cs in December 2005. By August 2006, they had already frayed and I was forced to send them back. Fortunately, Shure's customer service is excellent and they have a great exchange policy. However, now, six months later, my newer pair of buds have again frayed and I am again finding myself having to send them back for exchange (hopefully they will).I'm thinking that maybe the cold, dry winters of New York aren't good for the plastic wire coating. Nonetheless, perhaps Shure should look into using a different, softer type of plastic that won't crack and fray as a result of the elements."
2,Great While They Last,"After ~2 years of use, the connection on these headphones failed (and I didn't physically damage them in any way, just plugged them in and out, like one does with headphones...). It began by sporadically losing one channel, then that channel dropped out entirely, and now no sound comes through...for $80 one would expect better production values, no matter how they sound."
2,Not worth it,"the product is terrible. the plugs, all the different sizes, don't fit and were very comfortable. the plugs kept falling out."
5,Great Earphones for the Money,"These are great earphone for what that cost, infact they would be great for the money even if they cost more. I used them on a plane and it blocked out over 95% of the engine noiise, I forgot I was on a plane. When using them just around town, they block out lawn mowers, dogs, and cars whizzing by. They sound great, and I am noticing things in the music I never have before."
3,Great product but...,These ear phones do sound great but they're just not for everyday use. They do come with different size and style ear buds to custom fit your ear. With me the ear phone will occasionally pop out of my ear no matter which ear bud I use. It get's annoying after a while.
4,Great Price for an Above Average Headset,"I've been using the Shure product on and off for a few years in the studio and jumped all over the super-discounted E2C headset that Amazon had available a while back. While not perfect, these great earphones have left me quite happy with my decision.The good:Great sound quality.Significant number of options for different ears.Fit and finish is above average; Shure reputation is outstandingEarphones include a relatively compact and very secure casePrice/value is very goodThe bad:The most comfortable earpieces for my ears are ORANGE?!?!? Orange?!?!It takes a bit of effort to fit the earphones properlyThe cable is a bit too long and bulky for my tasteAt the end of the day, this is one of the best in-ear headsets that I've ever owned. I'm just curious now what you for the money of the Shure headsets at five times the price..."
4,Would be a 5 were it not...,"for the fact that I've had issues with them twice already.They are very durable, sound great, etc. etc. There are no issues with the quality in my opinion.However, I've sent them in once and they were replaced because one started to malfunction and just recently I've begun to have issues relating to the cord which someone else mentioned. Shure, however, is very responsive and the 2 year warranty is pretty good. Also, keep in mind I think I abuse my pair and use them a lot so even if they didn't replace them, I think they've served me well and for $65 which is what they're going for now, they can't be beat.That said, I think the best endorsement I can give for these headphones is the fact that I will be sending in my pair to Shure (and they'll probably send me a new pair back) and will be purchasing another pair, probably the SE210s to see what the next step up offers.When it comes to headphones, I'm definitely a Shure fan (and Grado)."
2,"Overpriced, Weak Bass, Uncomfortable.","Do any of these reviewers know what they are talking about? The sound of these earphones is below average at best. Sure they beat those five bucks earphones you find in Wal-mart, but they do not justify the sixty dollar pricetag. They don't sound good with bass heavy music and can hurt your ears. Even the smallest fit pieces are too big for me. You are better off with the Sony Fontopia for 1/2 of the price. The Sony earphones are far more comfortable and sound better in the low end. But I have to warn you the wires on the Sony is very thin and won't last very long. The Shure E2c on the other hand, have very nice thick cord and will last you a long time."
1,"Great Sound, Horrible Durability","These earbuds sound fantastic, stay in your ear well have ample cable length and fit snugly with multiple different rubber tips. I only wish they were made to last. If you use these earbuds, they WILL fall apart. The rubber insulation on the wire WILL rot and crack and peel away leaving you with bare exposed wires. No problem, right? Shure is a great company that will replace them under warranty, right? WRONG. They will tell you to purchase a newer model that has a replaceable cord. Why would newer models have a replaceable cord unless they, as a company, are fully aware of the poor quality of their previous products and instead of fixing the issue would rather charge you more money for replacement parts. I say again, do not buy products from Shure, they will not last."
2,Don't Bother,"I bought these headphones as an upgrade to the premium headphones that came with my Zune. However, these headphones are more expensive and don't sound any better than the probably overpriced Zune ones. I had a really hard time finding end caps that fit into my ears without falling out and ensuring the sound isolating properties of the headphones. When I did finally find a set that works, the sound quality isn't any better than what I was used to. Sound isolation was achieved, but didn't really matter since the sound quality was not there. Finally, after about 4 weeks the right ear bud no longer works... and I can't figure out why. These ended up in the trash and I will not buy these headphones again."
1,Don't buy,"I bought these because my cheap sony earphones had been chewed up by a dog. It took amazon 3 weeks to get them to me. I then spent 30 minutes getting the perfect fit, and then I tried them out. It was almost all treble, I thought it was my ipod so I tried them on everything and anything. They were almost painful to listen to, and if I changed the equalizer on the output device they sounded distorted. I am now listening to music on my cheap dog chewed headphones and returning these back to amazon."
1,Wires Rot and Short!!,"I loved the sound and the fit more than any other pair I've ever owned. They lack in bass but not a big deal to me. Loved them EXCEPT!!!! Within 6 months without fail the wires' insulation rots, gets brittle, and breaks. I've owned 3 pair because I like them so much, but without fail they short out. I'm nice to them too!! Sad because their fit design is SO GOOD! And sound isolation is the best I've experienced. If I was rich I'd just but 20 pair and go through them like toilet paper, but I'm not.VERY NICE..............SHORT LIFE."
2,too expensive for such poor durability,"Bottom line: this is supposed to be a ""portable"" product; it's not. The wires are simply too delicate to endure. Plus, as another reviewer mentioned, the carrying case is designed to practically guarantee failure. It's like storing a paperclip in a container that forces you to flex it back & forth a bit each time you store it.To me, an expensive product that is, in fact, designed to fail & designed to produce a follow-up purchase is not acceptable.So, if you plan to use them on the go, don't expect them to last more than several months."
5,Great Sound - Great Isolation,Fortunately I read your few bad reviews of this product after I had placed my order. I love them. Properly fitted they provide a very fine audio experience. I also own a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones. They are a bit bulky to take walking with my iPod. The Shure earbuds sound great and also isolate better than the Bose - without batteries. I had used expandable foam ear plugs for industrial hearing protection for years so it is only logical to adapt them to high quality earphones.
3,"superb sound quality, but becomes less comfortable over time","For earbuds, these have superb sound quality. I'm amazed sometimes at the sound that comes out of these tiny little things. However, it has becomes much less comfortable to wear over the 3 years I've owned these. I do not know if I am unique in this, but I have had to slowly move up in size, as it expanded my ear canal. Overuse of any earbuds increases the risk of earwax buildup, but I had significant problems with earwax because, presumably, they create an airtight seal around the ear canal so that more and more gets trapped within.It's a balance between the sound quality/noise reduction and the discomfort. In the beginning, I was awed by the sound. But over time, the discomfort won out and now I don't use them at all."
5,Ipod Necessity,"Freaking awesome!!! The way sound is suppose to be heard through earphones. Great stereo separation and volume levels where you wnat them.WARNING: Do not wear these while walking near traffic. You will not hear anything external, except yourself breathing. A lttile weird at first but completely isolating.Enjoy."
2,OUCH!,These just aren't comfortable in my ears. None of the many ear canal adapters seem to feel comfortable enough. Definitely can't wear these for more than 15-20 minutes at a time.
5,Excellent delivery,I received the headphones in perfect condition and on time. They were a gift for my husband's birthday and he was thrilled. It was easy and the service was stellar.
1,The Worst,"Got these for only $40, but might as well have thrown the money in the trash. The sound is worse than any headphones/earbuds I've ever had including the ones from the Dollar Store. I found the sound VERY TINNY, so gave them to my son & he agreed- they suck. Wouldn't use them even if they were free. Unfortunately by the time I got my son (lives out of town)to check them out it was past return period. Afraid to put on Ebay as buyer would probably be dissatisfied also. Oh well, win some, lose some."
1,Dissapointing,These headphones were really disappointing. Sony has a much better product For 1/3 the price. The sound quality was lacking and tinny.
4,Not What I Was Expecting,The book wasn't exactly what I thought it would be like but I still enjoyed it. There were a lot of examples of human behavior studies which I found very interesting . . . but I am not sure exactly how it all applied to happiness.
5,An Entire Different Look at Happiness,"Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert opens a view of happiness that is not in the normal range. Anticipation, imagination and rationalization are each responsible for much of our happiness. Mr. Gilbert disects the reasons we are happy, the times we are happy, and how we visualize our happiness. Great book - makes a person think about what they really have, want to have or don't really need.Prudent Pam"
5,Learn To Be Happy,"Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert stresses in his book with a scientific explanation, that humans have limited imaginations which steer them in the wrong direction in their search for happiness. According to the author since we err in remembering our past we concurrently err in imagining our future and we will err on imagining what will make us happy. Not only that but you tend to repeat the same errors in imagining what will make you happy. One of our biggest problems according to Gilbert is humans desire to control everything they can. They even try to control the uncontrollable.+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Are you a spiritual retard, or are you on the path to ENLIGHTENMENT?+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +"
1,Poorly Written and Not Funny,"I got through the first chapter or two hoping the book would become more interesting, but it never really did. The author tries to be witty like the writers of Freakonomics, but doesn't come close, and the attempts to be funny in every other sentence and not having it really work make it hard to read. Like some of the other one star reviewers, I'm puzzled at the amount five star reviews this book received, because usually books here at Amazon with those kind of reviews are actually pretty good, like Freakanomics and Fooled by Randomness.The book itself just seemed to be a lot of high level analysis of unrelated, simplistic college student experiments on human nature strung together enough to make a book."
3,good but not so good,"maybe i had very high expectations when i read the nytimes book review, or maybe i did not understand all the psychological explanations, but i found this book to be utterly confusing. some of the information was very insightful, especially some of the studies, but most of the time i was skipping pages to get to something interesting, something that i would understand. based on the small blurbs on the cover i just waited and waited for my 'aha' moments (like the ones during freakonomics), but i seemed to have missed the thesis of the book and got more confused and lost as i proceeded towards the end."
3,tough reading,Ordered this book on the title. The author is a professor at Harvard. The editors made it more user freindly. You can grasp the concepts from clinical results and apply them to your sense of reality. The end result is you are respondsible for yourself. Good Luck. Hope you have a good life.
5,Best book I've Listened To All Year,This was the best book I listened to all year. It was very entertaining and raised a lot of interesting questions about how we perceive the future and to some degree the past.
4,Stumbling on the title,"This is a highly interesting and readable book, but the title is somewhat misleading. As the author points out in the Foreword, this is in no way a self-help guide. Instead, it is an in-depth exploration of how our minds construct the future and how this conception is systematically and predictably inaccurate. The author is an academic psychologist who brings the scholarly diligence one would expect to the subject but lightens it with a breezy style that at times reaches a little too hard for one-liners. There is even a glimmer of hope offered in the final chapter regarding how best to predict a successful outcome in the pursuit of happiness. Like many of the insights Gilbert explores, it may prove surprising. Even without any promise of practical applicability, this will prove a fascinating read for anyone interested in how the mind works."
3,Very Interesting....,"This is a fascinating book and gives one pause to consider how much of our thought process is ""automatic"" or ""hardwired"" versus true original thinking. The book has given me food for thought and how it applies in my life."
4,Psychology of expectations,"""Stumbling on happiness"" is not as much about happiness, or how to acquire it, but about our cognitive processes that construct the expectation of happiness. Daniel Gilbert exposes a number of flaws in our reasoning: we tend to overestimate the positive impact, we rationalize bad outcomes, we err in our imaginations, and many more. The book is unlikely to change your life, but it is chock-full of interesting studies and trivia - becoming aware of common mistakes in our perception of happiness may well be half the battle towards achieving it."
5,Love this book,"I tend to only review products I like (unless I really, really hated it). But I love this book. Just the discussion of psychological experiments alone was worth the weight. Daniel's ability to not over complicate all the concepts and issues addressed is wonderfully refreshing. Plus, I was able to give my local librarian an ""Ah hah"" moment using one of the examples from the book. That was golden."
1,"Waisted Time and Money for People, Who Look For Big Picture of Now","Philosophical musing of hard core materialistic reductionist, incapable of open-mindedness to overcome blindness of shortsighted old-paradigm scientific dogmas, thus incapable to see a revolutionary ""big picture"", which is offered by cutting-edge scientific discoveries of our days in the fields of quantum physics, epigenetics, neurobiology, neurosociology, social and emotional intelligence, etc., etc., etc.This book gives no articulated, nor substantiated answer to the question it claims to give, just contributes to mental confusion and emotional illiteracy. Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy...Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now."
4,"Practical, scholarly approach to finding happiness","We've all gone down certain roads looking for happiness and found out, sadly, that the roads were dead ends.If you're like me, there have been times in your life when you have wanted to just give up on happiness. But Gilbert shows that happiness is attainable in ways that we may not expect.Gilbert shows why we seek happiness, and gives practical on how to ""stumble"" upon it. This book has given me insights that I never even imagined.Another book on this topic I'd recommend is: ""Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices"" by John Allen. It's more than just a Christmas story. It shows how kind acts and service to others are the real keys to lasting happiness.Also: the classic ""As A Man Thinketh"" by James Allen. (Are James and John related?)"
2,Not what I thought,"The author of this book doesn't claim to be able to make me happier, and I didn't really expect him to be able to do so. However, I did expect a book that was more cohesive and that really tackled the idea of happiness. Instead what I found was a group of descriptions of experiments done by psychologists throughout time. Some of these experiments were fascinating and highlighted interesting facts about the human imagination, but I often could not make the connection between these experiments and the happiness that was advertised by the book's title. Furthermore, the tone of the book's author was a bit informal for me. I like my research scientists to be a bit standoffish, and Daniel Gilbert was often too flippant for my taste. Overall, it didn't capture my interest as well as I'd hoped."
3,Deserves a listen...,"This album is pretty much hated among old-school Bad brains fans, and yes, it is very different from their early speedpunk/hardcore stuff. While far from a great album, it does have its moments which keep me from brushing it aside. As a reggae fan, I'm pleased with the plethora of reggae tunes here, and why they are by no means at the level of Burning Spear or Jimmy Cliff, they're not at all bad. The over-the-top cartoonish thrash of ""Justice Keepers"" always brings a smile to my face and makes me wanna jump around the room, making it a guilty pleasure of mine. A few of the songs, like ""Rights Of A Child"", are outright annoying, keeping this album from getting much time in my CD player. However, I'm glad I own it and can pull it out when I'm in the mood for some of their positive vibes."
1,Not worth the price,I did not find this video helpful at all. I had already covered those topics with my 8-year-old. I was hoping it would go a little beyond the absolute basics of boy and girl differences. That was $25 (plus shipping) down the drain since it did not even add to anything I taught my son.
1,Worst reception of any phone I've ever owned!,"This phone gets absolutely horrible reception. Every 30 seconds to 1 minute, the sound just completely cuts out for about 4 seconds. It doesn't matter where I am, in a city, in a building, outside in a wide open space. I used it in the exact same locations as I had used me last phone, and I couldn't understand a darn thing anyone was saying, and they couldn't understand me either. Making phone calls was MISERABLE! I hated trying to talk to people. But the problems did not start once the call had been initiated, it had a hard time dialing out, and often would proclaim ""no signal"" in places that I routinely used the phone before this one, and the one I bought after I couldn't deal with how horrible this phone was (about 1 month)."
1,terrible phone,"It makes calls, which if that's all you want then its perfect. Other than that, however, this phone does nothing else."
2,Basic Scale Book,Not quite total scales n techniques.It's a basic scale book full of your typical exercises.Nothing mind boggling and not nearly as total as the book would lead you to think.A student bought this book online and brought it in.He thought he was on to something until he got the book and was mythed to learn it wasn't exactly as advertised.As a teacher it's not bad but there is certainly much better methods on the market.
3,Great for TAB readers.,"This book is great if you prefer learning scales in written TAB. I personally, associate scales better with fret board patterns and shapes rather than TAB. If I tried to switch gears and start learning additional scales with TAB, this book would be fine. But I starting learning scales by breaking down the fretboard into shapes and patterns. So if you are more of a visual person and memorizing shapes and patterns comes easier than memorizing TAB, this may not be the book for you."
1,Shotgun Bride,The second in the Mckettrick Triology just didn't do it for me!I enjoyed the first in series - High Country Bride - about Rafe and Emmeline but this book was so boring I could not even finish it! To me it was wrote like a bad scrren play for an old western. The characters couldn't come through and the way author portrayed them in this novel made them seem truly dumb!I would save your money and hope the third in the series is more like te first!
5,Shotgun Bride,"I have loved all of Linda Lael Miller's books I have read. They grab me from the beginning, and I can't put them down til the end. I love having a series of books that follow a family, even across generations. If you haven't tried one of her books, you should. You won't regret it."
4,These McKettrick boys sure know how to make a girl lose her mind,"Challenges: Read for Fun, Read-a-ThonOverall Rating 4.50Story Rating 4.50Character Rating 4.50First Thought when Finished: These McKettrick boys sure know how to make a girl lose her mind :)Oh I love historical romance! Specifically, early American historical romance--it makes me smile. Kade McKettrick is all Cowboy: stubborn, hard-headed, loyal, smart, and sometimes just a wee bit cocky (ok nothing wee about it) and Sister Mandy (LOL) was just the woman to put him in his place. I don't know about you but hard not to love a western romance where the girl beats the man in a horse race! Have to admire her gumption!Final Thought: If you like stubborn cowboys and hard-headed women, you will love this series!"
5,The Best Gum,"We buy this gum by the boxES! The flavor lasts a long time, and you can chew it all day if you want!"
4,The first and best metal music of my life!,"I will be frank, this album blew me away. The attraction? The cover. Mastodon's ""Blood Mountain"" album is the first metal album I've listened to and have not stopped listening at all. Unlike other bands who scream death and grotesque remarks, Mastodon keeps it going with rhythms of power and melodies unlike before, filled with fantastical references. ""Pendulous Skin"" is the one track that changed the way I perceived metal, and other such tracks in this album simply are unforgettable."
5,Metal's saviours,"This is easily the most interesting hard rock release I have heard in the last two years. Along with Down, this band is truly carrying the flag for all the metalheads who aren't totally fascinated by ultra-fast playing and vomit vocals. Each track takes them in a new direction, so predictable they are most definitely not. From the amazing opening track, these dudes play the hell out of it and there's so much going on it stays interesting after several dozen plays. The vocals are a superb fit with the music. As a former fan of Today is the Day, I was pleased to discover they share some personnel with that outfit. The awesome cover art is just the cherry on the cake."
5,Superb Performance,"I have an extensive collection of recordings of all types (thousands really) and I have over two dozen recordings of the Berlioz piece. Although this performance is virtually unknown to most listeners, I can say definitively that there are no better interpretations, and few that equal it. I have no idea who Carlo Zecchi was, but I know that the Czech Philharmonic is one of the greatest orchestras in the world, and was so at the time this was produced. The interpretation has both power and subtlety. The Ball is definitive, with a glow unequaled anywhere else. And, the finale has (quite literally) more power and impact than that of any other performance I have heard (and I believe I've heard most of them.) This recording is very highly recommended."
2,average,"with the exception of you put a move on my heart,stuff like that&slow jams this is pretty average.tamia is a way better vocalist than brandy.brandy in fact almost ruins rock with you.quincy jones is the producer of producers genius,legend,etc.. but this isn't with his standards."
5,Excellent Program needs to be Made Available in Region 1,This series set a standard for its genre and I've yet to see anything comparable.Attention to detail was one of the hallmarks of this series; after all these years I still remember how each actresses' physical appearance was carefully altered to reflect dietary and other physical deprivation; I wonder how many of today's actresses would allow themselves to be seen week after week in such realistic fashion.It also was shown on the BBC where it gained almost cult status and BBC TV offers a box set of the entire series in DVD PAL format. On my list to buy since one can download an all region DVD viwer and watch on computer.
3,"It's a cute book, but not worth the price","It's a really cute book and it made me cry the first time I read it. But honestly I wouldn't have bought it if I realized how small and flimsy it is. If my son gets a hold of it, it will be destroyed. It would have been a lot better if it was released as a board book."
5,Best Translucent Powder,Sets the foundation really well. You'll want to reapply about twenty minutes after the initial application but after that you're pretty much set for the rest of the day. This has been my favorite powder ever since I first tried it about 8 years ago. I have yet to find a cleaner finish.
1,Not what I expected,"This ""confection"" is not in anyway like licorice. The licorice confection made by Panda does seem to use the same filling; a brown ""wheaty"" mass that is somewhat chewy, not at all sweet though. The raspberry confection is coated in raspberry flavor, but it cannot mask the filling flavor."
5,Best Book Ever on Parenting,"I've always been a huge Dr. Dobson fan. I purchased this book when I was at my ""whits end"" (for those of you familiar with Adventures in Odyssey). As expected I was thrilled with the entire book. Dr. Dobson has real life examples that had me saying ""that's me! that's my kids!"" the whole way though. And of course he gives the instructions on how to go from beeing the terrible example to being the family who lives in harmony with obedient children. He doesn't just teach you how to get your kids to obey, but also instructs you how to raise them though adolecents - saying no when necessary and yes when possible.I loved this book. You won't be dissappointed if you purchase this book!!"
1,"Sad, cruel book. Zero stars.","It's hard to imagine a worse parenting manual. Hopefully, parents today are too wise to waste their money on such profound misinformation. Children are not criminals to be whipped into shape. They are cherished gifts to be taught with love and patience and by example.Grandmother of seven."
3,Some good ideas if kept in perspective.,"This book doesn't deserve the uproar it's causing. Dr. Dobson states repeatedly in the book that he advocates spankings only in rare instances of blatant, deliberate disobedience, and not even for all children because children are so different. As for the Christian justification of corporal punishment, that is indeed nonsense and shouldn't be taken literally. But I have read several books that are full of psychobabble and permissiveness and I have found them beyond useless, and I am pleased that someone encourages discipline. By the way I have managed to apply Dr. Dobson's principles of establishing guidelines for good behavior and responsibility WITHOUT ever spanking my child, and I believe it is these principles exactly that have made it unnecessary for me to ever have to spank her."
2,Not enough discipline tips and too much personal agenda,"The book was touted as a guide for teachers and parents who are having discipline troubles or who are interested in learning about proper discipline. While there were some interesting tips and case studies, the book, overall, ignored teachers (which is why I read the book in the first place) and focused on parents. Moreover, in the Discipline in Morality Chapter, The author spouts right wing rhetoric and completely undermines any good advice that was offered in the first half of the book. I thought there was little place in a discipline book for this type of preaching. The book is short, not comprehensive, and at points, offensive when the preaching begins."
5,best book for parents,"This is the best book on parenting I have ever read. It is also excellent for teachers or anyone involved with children. I have begun giving it as a baby shower gift, it's that good."
1,A horrible book of terrible advice,"Dobson, who exhibits no understanding in either religion or child psychology has written a book touting corporal punishment as a primary means of raising children. This in a day when our knowledge of child-rearing clearly shows that corporal punishment, while it may cow children into immediate obedience, is also a precursor of anti-social behavior. Children who have been beaten learn that ""might makes right"" and often become bullies on the playground and abusers in their marital relationships. The evidence is that today's abusers were punished with belt, fist, rod, and whip as children.Dobson has nothing useful to offer in this book. Neither his psychology, nor does his understanding of the bible teach a method of raising loving and caring Christian children."
5,The New Dare To Discipline,"I find it interesting that the reviews aren't listed in such a way as to represent anything current, or present a balanced view of what readers think. Shame on Amazon for placing the worst reviews up front for people to read and making them ""dig"" for the good reviews. The first review is a single star, & written in 2003?! 5 years ago!! There are other good reviews written in the last month, but they aren't presented up front. What a shame. Dr. Dobson never promotes child abuse of any kind and never would. It's too bad that some children have to grow up in environments where their parents weren't able to use his advice in such a way that the child didn't benefit. However I can't believe that someone's entire abusive childhood can be blamed on a single book or two. Sounds like something was desperately wrong with the parents that isn't or wasn't obvious to the child at the time or even now. So sorry for all who had to grow up like that."
1,Child Abuse!,"I leafed through a copy of this book at a woman's house today and am SHOCKED that this book is even in print. Do the world a favor and buy a Sears and Sears book instead. This book literally made me sick to my stomach. I feel so sorry for all the children being raised by this book and for the parents who have fallen prey to this type of ""advice."""
3,Curious about this newer edition,"Honestly, my husband's the one who purchased this ebook, so I can't give a review. I plan to read it when he's done reading it."
2,"Too much Psychology, not enough Scripture","Although I respect Dr. Dobson and his agenda, I have to say that I believe there is way too much psychology and not enough Scripture in his parenting advice. There are no ""timeouts"" in the Bible, nor is there the differentiation of willful disobedience and disobedience. ALL disobedience is willful!! So, it is either disobedience or a mistake. There is too much gray and not enough black and white. It is possible to have consistent discipline in a loving environment. Be encouraged that there is no need to make tons of excuses for our children's behavior. Simply address the heart issue, remove the foolishness, snuggle and love your children and they will desire to live lives that are pleasing to the Lord. Check out Ginger Plowman's book ""Don't Make Me Count to Three"" for a much more Bible based approach to reaching the hearts of our children through loving discipline."
3,Fun music,"Lounge music for teenagers? Real hi-fi, and a LOT of fun. If you liked 50's pop like ""Tan Shoes & Pink Shoelaces"" or ""Chantilly Lace"", these tracks will fit right in. I can't remember if ""ginchy"" ever caught on as a catch-phrase tho.The album is short, and the Kookie character theme gets a little repetitious. But only a few of these songs had been on CD before this release. Of those that hadn't, a few are gems. The last track is very short (1:37) but really hot (should that be cool?) ..."
5,Roaster takes place of second oven,Found out at Christmas that I needed another oven to roast my prime rib roast. Only had one oven what was I to do. My neighbor brought over her Nesco roaster and solved the problem. We roasted the prime rib roast in the roaster and it came out perfect! Soon I went online and order one for myself. How did I ever manage without it!!!!!
4,Very nice rendering of he Book of Psalms.,This makes a wonderful psalter and the inclusive language puts forth a stately figuring of the psalms. Would be nice to include a chart of the best psalms to pray during the liturgical seasons and those suitable for Morning and Evening prayers. The Morning and Evening Canticles added would make this book a more superb prayerbook.
1,Horrible quailty control,"The pants I received had some stitching missing, Velcro hanging loose and what looked like a last minute hand stitch on the inner liner that would never hold up during wear. I contacted jafrum and they asked I send pic's over and I did right away with my camera phone. She said she would send me a fed-ex label over so I could send them back. 3 days later and still no email, contacted her again and she said to check my spam folder, nothing. I needed the pants for a trip I had planned and didn't have anymore time. I had my grandma break out the sewing machine and she did a great job repairing the pants. I sent jafrum an emailing saying I had the pants taken care of and was wondering if I could get a discount towards my next purchase. She wanted to see a receipt where I had the pants fixed. I'll never buy from jafrum again and don't advise anyone else to either. I Should of just saved for the Tourmaster pants."
5,Great Ski Pants Alternative,"I have used these pants more often as Ski Pants than as Motorcycle Pants. I've used the pants as Ski Gear for several weeks in very cold and snowy conditions. Even @ -25 degrees they kept me really warm all day even when standing in one spot for long periods. I felt particularly warm around my knees due to the armor. As Ski Pants these outperform every Ski Industry Pants I've used. Zero water got through the tough outer shell. Neither did they sweat on the inside. I can even kneel in the snow and not get cold because of the armor. However, the armor is kinda hard for kneeling all the time. I removed the hip inserts and the pants felt more comfortable. These pants seem super-tough and should last for years.Yes these Motorcycle Pants are baggy. So what? That just made them more roomy where they need to be and yet the waist and length are just right. These Pants are about use and not fashion. And at this killer price I could buy 6 pair or more to get comparable Ski Pants."
2,Not everything is what it appears to be.,"I was very upset to receive an outdated version of this reference book. The photo image is of the most recent edition and so is the purchasing information. I will not purchase anything else from this vendor. You can't judge a book by its cover and apparently you can't buy one based on it, or the info provided, either. Caveat emptor - buyer beware!"
5,A Brand New Midsomer Murders Fan,"I was introduced to Midsomer Murders recently. I bought Set 17 and Set 18 at a steal on Amazon. I really enjoyed all the episodes on both sets. I think the show is just simply incredible. It's so slow moving but before you know it the show's over.I do have a question for all the diehard Midsomer Murders fans out there. Would anybody know if the other sets have subtitles? I would like to buy the other sets but only if there are subtitles. The British English is kind of difficult for me to understand.Anyway, I'm now a big fan of Midsomer Murders and I highly recommend this show to all Agatha Christie fans. Thank you very much."
3,Helpful guide,"This book is very well written. It disribed VP very well. But unfortunately, there is no ressources in that book for women who live outside USA."
3,simple and sweet,"I bought this book, one of many, I am using to expose my grand-children to French. I love the simple lay-out, bright colors, and I like the fact it is bilingual."
2,Too Wordy,"I bought this book for my 2 year old's birthday. When I read it to him, it was way too complex compared to the other Thomas books. Also, it was kind of annoying because everything Thomas said, he repeated it in the book. I regret buying this book."
1,I would so give this a 5 Star Review only for the fact that this is not the Imported Reissue that Amazon says it is.,"I ordered this CD via through Amazon thinking that it was the reissue with the Bonus Track of 25 or 6 to 4.As it states in the information reguarding this CD. BUYER BEWARE!!! Athough this is the reissue of Vince Neils Carved in Stone, It does not have this song as a bonus track, There for it nothing but a regular reissue of the same CD that was released in 1995 on Beyond Music and not Warner Bros. Other then this little misguided information I would Definatly give this release a 5 Star rating."
2,Lots of info but nothing on swapping engines,"If you want to swap a EFI engine into an vehicle that never had it you will need to understand how fuel injection works. This book will help you understand it in pretty good detail. However, it does not help you understand what to expect when swapping an engine. I think maybe his title ""swappers guide"" refers to the sections on swapping parts on a fuel injected engine for better performance. I know I need to buy a different book to find what I was looking for."
5,Green Tea Fat Metabolizer,"Have used this product for several years and found it to be the single best supplement for use in losing or maintaining weight and correct metabolism levels. Keeps the appetite under control with a proprietary blend of natural herbal boosters and nutrients that, when used with a healthy diet plan, has a dual action effect on weight loss.

5,a must-read for every Rio fan,Ruy Castro's chronicle of Rio takes you through the city's centuries long history to where it is today: the marvelous city. Castro has great wit and humor and has knack for telling a story. Excellent quick read before visiting Rio before the Carnival.
2,"Ok, but not fabulous bubbles","My son (5yo)has very sensitive skin and eczema; we usually only use cetaphil, phisoderm baby or aquaphor baby wash on him. He has for years wanted to take a bubble bath so I finally bought this. He has taken about 4 or 5 bubble baths now. He has not broken out or had a reaction to it, but it definitely does not create big fabulous bubbles either. He is somewhat satisfied but I am still a little sad for him. I will be happy when someone is able to create a sensitive skin bubble bath that makes LOTS of big fun bubbles.This barely does more than just pouring some of the regular wash in as the water fills up; and it costs MUCH more!Disappointed!I recommend you save your money!"
4,electric fry pan,"The product was a little damaged, however the box was a wreck, it had been taped and the UPS driver opened the box to see contents. the bottom is not level and there are marks on the pan, I do not have a box to send it back, so I'm using it. not happy Mary Lou"
5,Handy Dandy..,"Great bag to help organize tools. Actually holds quite a bit for it's size. Bag it high quality and ultra durable too. I was so impressed with it, I bought one for by father and one for my father-in-law."
4,Very good resource book,"Online Genealogy is a fun hobby that is increasing in popularity. It use to be a hassle trying to contact libraries and record halls by mail or telephone.The ""Idiot's Guide..."" will show you everything you need to know to get started setting up your family tree. Make sure you have as much detail, about your history, available when you begin your search, to make things easier.If you already belong to a genealogy club, this book might seem redundant. But it is a nice reference to have when you don't feel like searching your bookmarks for a specific page.I bought this for my mother, and she found it very useful. Of course she still writes half of her bookmarks down on paper."
5,Luxurious robe,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The material is perfect for cold winter nights, and the cut is great. As far as sizes, my wife is 5'6"" and the XL size is great. Very pleased with this"
3,Far too tight,"I own several other pairs of Allen Edmonds - Park Avenues in 11D, Kenwoods in 11D, Meranos in 11D. All fit very well (though the Park Avenues are a tiny bit tight). After reading the reviews here, I ordered the Walden in 11E.Even an 11E is too tight for me. I'm not sure how the sizing works on these, but it's not right. Would highly recommend trying them on somewhere before purchasing them."
5,"Awesome book- must read for Advertising, Marketing, and PR",Great book and great advice. Awesome examples and very applicable to today's over-communicated life.
1,Overated,"I'm not a mkting professional nor an Adman and yet i could see right through the thinly constructed arguments in this tome. For example, the authors cite an alternative strategy (presumably in lieu of mkting / advertising campaigns in known travel and other publications) they would recommend to the central american country Guatemala to increase their share of worldwide tourism spend. They're concept is simple, rename the country 'Guatemaya' to reflect its Mayan heritage.Bloody hell! That's something one might vet internally BEFORE the client meeting along with all the other goofy stuff one throws out during the creative process, but to actually suggest something like that to the client?Wow... i put the book down right there..."
4,makes you think..which is good!,"One has to understand not to take all what is said as the sole truth and then it's working great. There are loads of great examples...though definatly seems like they themselves drive Volvo or Volvo has paid authors to write such good reviews about it. Anyhow...when reading I kept in mind to be subjective and not to take it all as the truth, becasue then you end up jumping in your strategies as soon as you finish another book.Neverthelsess, great ideas, great samples, a bit too arrogant look that PR is the only way...but I'll take it."
1,The ultimate resposibility of advertising IS PR,"In the surmountable aspect of Public Relation, no other device is poorly used, yet has the potential for greatness than Advertising. Advertising is, in all points of fairness, an extenstion of Public Relation... a broad yet clear message of what the company is, what the company sells, and what the company can offer you.For these schmucks to ever think that advertising is not an extension of PR, or to think that it is not useful and ""dead"", shows how much they actually know about the business of Marketing. Advertising is a model vehicle for brand recognition, brand strength, and brand longetivity.Any ""advice"" in this book is ultimately a reflection of their own personal greed... of course they want you to think advertising is dead and that PR is king.. because they are in the PR business.Do not buy this book... it will be a waste of your valuable time, and it will ultimately doom you to failure."
2,Frustrating,"The projects in the book all center around a single XML structure, planets in the Solar System. Althought the structure is easy to understand, it does not illustrate other more real world problems, so this book is not useful as a cookbook or idea book.Secondly, the examples show the application of xslt in a simplistic and difficult to understand manner that falls short of the requirements of a reference. It also fails as a reference due to poor organization, poor index, and lack of comprehensive coverage.Finally, I feel that the author moves too quickly and fails to illustrate complex concepts well enough for this book to be used as a primer.Overall, I have found this book to be frustrating to use and would recommend that buyers save their money."
3,Fun but not much to it.,"My wife and I got this game a few days ago and we are enjoying it but there isn't much to it. It is a really cute little game with cute music and fun to play but all you do is unlock new recipes each time you score high enough on existing recipes. It consists of choosing a recipe to cook and then you are timed with a series of minigames to complete each part of the cooking process beginning with anything from peeling potatoes, slicing onions, coating and frying meat, and everything else on up to arranging the food on a plate. It's a neat little distraction for a quick game. If you are looking for a game with depth and longevity, look elsewhere; however, if you are looking for a cute and quick little cooking game, then this is it."
3,Fun but it gets repetitive after a while,"Cooking Mama is a game that lets you chop, stir and cook your way through various Japanese-style dishes. It was really fun in the beginning trying to get better at slicing and dicing my way through a recipe but after a while, it became repetitive and I got bored. There is no advancement through more difficult and complicated moves or recipes, so it stagnated. I'm sure that it would be more fun if it was made a multi-player game where players can compete in skills or speed, but as a stand-alone game, it's just allright. It could be a pretty good game for kids to give them a harmless, virtual taste of cooking and handling knives."
4,My 7 yr old just loves this...,"She wants to show me EVERY dish she makes and is still thrilled after 2 months when she has made something. I personally did not find it all that exciting, only because there was no good goal or reason for playing. I prefer puzzle games. You do unlock more dishes, but it was not quite to my taste. That being said, my children are absolutely fascinated by it. My daughter is now convinced that if I let her have free reign of the kitchen, she could cook anything, and my sons love to watch. It is also a hit when friends come over to visit."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!","This game is very fun to play with, but when you want to play with a friend on the game, it takes at least 15 minutes to play with that friend. Overall, I love the game."
4,"Repetitive, but still good fun","Gameplay get a bits repetitive after a while, but it's still pretty fun. Some parts of this game are actually quite challenging."
5,Cooking Mama,My grand daughter has wanted this for a while but the stores were always out of it. Needless to say she i thrilled that I got it for her.
4,"A Little Simple, Yes, But...","I've been reading the previous reviews and I understand the complaints. I've been playing the game for 2 weeks and I can see that once you've done everything (which won't take extremely long) there's nothing left to do. But, it's a 20 dollar game. And here you can get it for 16. I say it definitely worth the money. It's fun and different. It's all based on the stylus. You get to make so many recipes and there are a lot of different tasks you have to perform to make each one. I also like that there can be variations to the recipes. It's a different game and I appreciate it for that. One more thing...this isn't a game about challenge. You don't move up levels, besides bronze, silver, and gold medals depending on how well you made the meal."
5,Great Fun!,"I bought this game for my daughter's birthday and it's turned into her favorite! She says, ""It's fun and you get to do things like you were really cooking in the kitchen. You can make real recipes just like at your house."" I picked this game up on a whim and I'm very pleased with how much she enjoys it!"
3,Cute,"I rented Cooking Mama, partly out of curiosity, partly as a joke. It sounded silly and I didn't expect much of it. My boyfriend's 10 yr old daughter asked me what I was playing, and when I told her it was a cooking game, she looked at me like it was the dumbest game she'd ever heard of. However, she tried it and now she's hooked. It's cute and fun in small doses. I haven't unlocked all the recipes yet, but it doesn't seem that it would have any replay value afterward (thus the 3 star overall rating). I don't really understand the point of combining recipes either. You're not really combining anything. You're really just making two separate recipes and putting them on the same plate. The timed challenges can range from very simple to frustrating."
1,Burn it -Please don't buy it,My daughter desperately wanted this for her birthday ....I tried it out myself and I have to say I was never so disappointed in a game - i cant understand its appeal( apparently there are several new versions) I feel like writing to Nintendo to get my money back...I am certain it was created by absolute morons...Nintendo should get back in the kitchen and cook up something else - for now I think I'll throw it down the garbage disposal!
2,At least track one is excellent,"I came to this CD looking for...a good CD. I found a good song. Unfortunately, everyone has heard the song before. Yes, the song I'm talking about is ""Hey Man, Nice shot."" The two stars above are for this song only. The rest of the CD is followed by 10 butchered versions of the first song. Seriously, though, Filter reuses some of the highlights of that track in the other songs in painfully noticeable ways. It seems as though Filter had one great idea (track 1) and tried to stretch it for all its worth. I afraid I can't recommend this CD."
5,Short Bus is great,I've been a fan of these guys since 95 and I can tell you that this is a great album. Filter should have got a lot more recognition for it back in 95. Richard Patricks voice is awesome and the rest of the guys kick ***. too.
5,Excellent Debut,"Filter's 1995 debut album, Short Bus, is a fine example of industrial rock (although Richard Patrick doesn't like the term) at its best. I find the criticism Rich has received regarding Filter's similarities to Nine Inch Nails to be absurd. I am a fan of both Filter and NIN and they are both very different. Trent Reznor relies heavily on electrical methods (which I do not condone at all), whereas Rich's music is a lot more rock-based. ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" is the song that stands out after the first listen (partly due to the fact that its the first track), but repeated indulgence reveals the raw skills of Patrick and Brian Liesegang (the other main musical contributor to the album). The gritty music and Patrick's often lazy vocals add to the album's edge, the former being highlighted in ""Under"" and the latter in ""Stuck In Here"" and ""So Cool"". A must-buy for people with ears."
3,Handy but Superficial,"This map is attractive and compact, and is plasticized so it should endure a lot of rough treatment on a trip. It includes a diagram of the vaporetto (water bus) routes that would be more helpful if it were larger. The map covers the main tourist areas in reasonable detail, but it is of no use for one wishing to explore the less beaten paths. In short, it's pretty, but incomplete."
3,Who is he?,"Dr. Hunt provides no information regarding where he practices. I would have found him more credible if he had provided specifics about his CV.He offers few comprehensive success stories.The book in interesting, but the author refers the reader to various web sites that stock products he recommends. Some of the web sites do not exist, and the products cannot be found via traditional Google search. One wonders whether this sloppiness pervades other areas of the book."
2,Not necessary for dispensing Milky Spore,"I bought the dispenser for use over 1 acre of land, and quite honestly, I became frustrated with the dispenser and used a clean pot with holes in the bottom instead. The tube was next to impossible to fill in any sort of appreciable time without spilling Milky Spore all over your hands. If you get this product, a funnel is a must!!! Next, the actual method dispensing took a long time. I would up spreading Milky Spore on the stems of plants, my shoes, and pants. Also, I did this in the morning and the dispenser is made of cardboard. After a while, dew would swell and damage the end of the applicator.Overall, it's a good idea for applying the product, but save a few bucks and use household items instead."
1,Rip off,This so call dispenser is nothing more than a cardboard tube with some fine holes. You could purchase a tube from the post office and poke a few holes for a lot less.
2,Milky Spore Dispenser,I did not like this item because I wasn't able to judge properly how much of the product was being put down. I would not recomend it!
4,"very watery, but effective","This product is very watery, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It squeezes out and gets all over the place when you are just trying to get a little bit and sometimes the water and cream seperate inside the product so I have to shake the tube a bit before I use it or else i get a bunch of water coming out. This is pretty annoying but the fact that it works so well makes up for it. Gets rid of baby's rash within hours! Other stuff I've tried would take days."
5,Whole family loves this one,"We rented this movie at Blockbuster and my kids (Ages 6 and 4) kept asking to watch it, even after returning it. So I bought it here and they have been watching it often, haven't lost interest yet. I would definitely recommend it for families to watch together. Parents should be prepared to answer questions :o)"
1,YUCK,"I am so disappointed to say that this movie was horrible. The story line at first tries to mimic THe Prince of Egypt to get the story going and then actually does follow a lot of the Bible story but it is aestictically unappetizing. The animation is annoying. I just really wanted my children to see the full story, as the Prince of Egypt leaves out Awesome parts of the story of Moses. BUT this video, although it includes them should in no way be purchased as a means to fill in that gap."
5,Wrath of God,"Hopefully, if you get this dvd, you've seen ""Beowulf and Grendel"". If not, I would advise you to as it explains the problems involved in the production of this film. Bits of it are in the 'special features' of ""Beowulf"", but if you really enjoy the background of filming, this is wonderful! It was such a struggle with the elements and the financing, I'm amazed it was produced. Altogether a wonderful commentary on, and with, the people involved in the making of the film, the actors, the director and others. I loved both dvd's."
5,Fabulous Cd collection - Golden voice!,"I was blown away by Josef Locke's glorious voice. These songs are amazing! I loved the video of the same name, which caused me to search for the real Josef Locke's music. He is awesome! The quality of the Cd's are excellent, and the delivery time was speedy. I'm impressed."
5,Hungers of the Heart .... Fills your Heart !,"This is a book that will spark a flame in your heart, especially if you are the romantic sort ... it will put a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and butterflies in your stomach ! It reaches deep and brings to surface emotions that were perhaps hiding away !Definately a sit down in front of an open fire, with a glass of wine and a single rose in a vase, book !"
3,Spare the money,"This lens maybe be crystal clear, but coming in at .2x, this lens made even the closest shots look far away. The lens is soo big it blocked the flash, I had to buy an hot-shoe flash just so I could film at night. In conclusion, this lens is far too expensive for what its worth, I shoot skate photography, and I would recommend a lens that you dont have to be just about touching them with the camera too even see them. I'd strongly recommend either a .3x(raynox has one for 80 bux) or a .42x (ebay for 50 bux, I own a .42x, its alot better than this. even if it was only worth 150 bux less)"
2,Looking for a song title,Someone help me with the name of this song please from Crash. It plays just before Maybe Ttomorrow (while people throw wood on a torched car that the policeman ditched after accidently killing Don Cheadles brother). I believe it has some foreign lyrics and has a recurring piano chord.
5,The California Cool of Joanie Sommers,"I think Joanie was one of the first singers I fell in love with as a kid. She was so cute, the archetypical Warner Bros. babe!I missed out on the LPs the first time around, and collected them all in the 70s. Her fresh, crisp & cool delivery was like a Malibu breeze. No hint of cigarettes & brandy in her style! She had radio hits a la Connie Francis, but her LPs were strictly swinging jazz. ""For Those Who Think Young"" features a studio session with the great Marty Paich, and a live set with a Bob Florence combo - both first rate. Joanie still sounds just as fabulous 40 years later, and this is a wonderful place to discover her terrific singing style, even though all the discs are great!"
4,Great for heartburn relief,This product was recommended to me by a nutritionist for heartburn relief. It works! One tablet a day for a few weeks and the heartburn is gone. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for alternatives!
4,"Good book, need more to pass the exam.","I found this book to be very comprehensive, although it put emphasis on the wrong aspects, aspects that are not relevant to the exam. This is a good book if you want to learn to use SQL Server, however you should definately supplement it with a MeasureUp practice exam if you intend to pass the 70-229 exam. (I just passed the exam using this book and a MeasureUp exam for preparation.)"
4,Good reference,"This is a good, technical book with easy to follow guidelines by Dr. Denese. Bought it based on reviews of others and I'm glad to add it to my library."
4,OldMusicOK,I received the CD of two old Kingston Trio albums -- music I first listened to many years ago on LP. The wonders of technology -- I hear them with greater fidelity now than I did then.
4,Removal of SanDisk U3 Launchpad,"Like the other reviews I was annoyed by the U3 launchpad. All I wanted was a small flash drive with lots of storage. I REALLY did not like the dual drives showing up in the tool bar. Hey I just want to save files! Anyway, SanDisk has a free, fast tool to remove the U3 Launchpad. Simply download it, format the disk and yippee, you have a 2GB storage device.Launchpad removal tool from SanDisk is available herehttp://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1415or go to google and type: Sandisk remove u3Cheers!"
5,This is a useful tool,"After reading the predominantly negative reviews from other customers, still did not sound that they were being fair with the utility of this product. After going ahead and purchasing and using this product it seems to me that it is very handy for the main purpose that differentiates it from any regular flash drive: allows access to pieces of software that may not be installed in public computers, with the additional features of security. The slowness of the load up is exaggerated by the reviewers, in my tests that was not an issue at all. Button line is that the U3 capability is optional, but a nice thing to have especially for oversees travelers like myself. I really liked this product."
3,Storage device - fine; U3 software useless,"As a storage device for data, pictures etc. the product is fine. However, when I installed the U3 software, I could not transfer data to the device, and couldn't even get Windows (XP) to access it (write protect error message). Only after deleting U3 nonsense and formatting the drive could I use it for storage - that worked perfectly. Also, good luck getting info from Sandisk website - this was no help in resolving my problem, and there's no email customer support that I could find on Sandisk website."
5,Sandisk Cruzer,I'm very happy with this product. The security software allows me to transport files with confidence.
1,"DOES NOT WORK,","VERY DISAPPOINTED I THINK ITS A DEVICE CONFLICT OR SOMETHING, I HAVE ANOTHER STORAGE DEVICE THAT WORKS FINE"
4,"Good memory, too much bling","This is not your typical plug-it-in and click save. This product has way more programming on it than the usual user needs, like skype, etc. There's even a superfluous ""intro"" you have to go through before using the thing. Seems to work ok for the moment, though. Who knows? Maybe I'll end up using the skype."
1,This device contains a virus!,"As described by other reviewers, Sandisk wrote their own virus that infects your computer the instant you plug it in. It took me a lot of work and headache to figure out how to remove it. Because of this I may never buy another Sandisk thumb drive. I don't know what Sandisk's virus is after but I suppose that it could report market information off of your computer given that it has Internet Access. It takes advantage of people's use of thumb drives for file transer to spread itself to other people's computers. It is a good thing that it is possible to remove it or else I would have sent it back and demanded a refund."
2,boring fights....,ufc 119 was by far one of the worst ppv i have seen. the fights were boring and it was over hyped
1,GSI Percolator Insert,"Extremely thin aluminum construction. Came crushed despite the packing material. I was able to straighten it up enough to try it. There are two holes drilled in the base to help circulate water. In my opinion the design would be more efficient with only one hole, or maybe two smaller holes. While this works, I would suggest you save your money."
3,Meiner Meinung nach der schlechteste Jack Ryan Roman,Nicht so gut wie seine vorherigen Romane. Die Vorurteile der Amis gegen die europäischen Staaten und ihr Nationalstolz tropfen nur so aus dem Buch.
2,SOUND QUALITY VERY POOR,The sound quality is very poor. Such a shame because this great artist deserves much better.
2,Simple-istic,"This book is very basic and doesn't really address any of the big issues you would want to see like templated content creation, programmatic extensions, framework services. This is in part due to the design of Zope itself lacking in those areas.I came to Zope through Wiki. Looks like the idea of Collaboration servers is finally starting to gain some credence. Unfortunately, Wiki, which has been around for ever, is a hacked up mess written in Perl. Zope, being written in Python, and having much more structural mechanisms looked appealing. After looking at it, though, I've found that it to is a shortsighted solution. It is screaming out for a real XML foundation (and plumbing). Instead, you will find that it will let you do some things relatively quickly, but you'll want to hold your nose (unless you are a hacker in which case you may feel at home)."
5,His most comprehensive anthology to date.,"This historic 2-CD anthology of the legendary Johnny Pacheco's recordings for the Alegre, Fania and Vaya labels is truly something special. Not only do you get many of the best songs from his solo albums--you also get tracks from his collaborations with Celia Cruz, Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez, Hector Casanova and Monguito El Unico. Mr. Pacheco himself offers track-by-track comments on the songs in the booklet notes and the sound quality is as good as could be. Classic Salsa from one of Latin music's most respected and innovative figures."
4,Great history of a genre,"Most power pop fans will have already the majority of these songs, but that doesn't mean this collection isn't worth having. While not everything on here really qualifies as ""power pop"" (""Killer Queen"" by Queen?), it is a great collection of 48 songs over two CDs. They range from the modern classics (""Stacy's Mom"" by Fountains of Wayne) to the songs that originally gave ""power pop"" its name (""Go All The Way"" by The Raspberries). Since it's an import, there are enough obscurities here to make it worthwhile for the fan of this type of music (I don't know that I had ever heard ""Another Girl Another Planet"" by The Only Ones, but I liked it). If you're a power pop fan, this is almost two hours of great listening."
3,A good movie with a re-used plot.,"Charlie St. Cloud reminded me of the movie ""The Invisible."" Also, there was a TV show episode with a similar plot many years ago on I believe Nickelodeon. For me, this made the movie a little predictable, yet it was still entertaining.The acting was good, but the story could have went much deeper and could have been much more emotional than it was. It felt a bit lazy. I thought it was good how the movie had adult themes. I'd say this one is a rental."
2,Bad Acting,"Zac Efron's acting was questionable, especially during the moments where he was supposed to be upset and sad. His crying looked like he was ""acting"". He is more suited for light hearted comedies like ""17 again""."
3,Hollow inside....,"So this is about as 'deep' as Hollywood dares to go nowadays, especially when flaunting the acting chops of its 'beautiful', 'maturing' lead? I'd heard pretty decent things about this and it was....just ok. Seemed like a cross between ORDINARY PEOPLE and ALWAYS, or maybe a GHOST WHISPERER episode. What really got me though: the annoyingly 'cockney' friend of Zac's who's sole purpose seemed to be to give the film some London shabby-chic of the Russell Brand variety. There was never any explanation why some kid from London was digging graves and care taking at some remote Maine or Northern California seaside village!! Maybe the book explains it. I'm just so sick of these English actors being cast for no good reason and then they amp up their 'accent' (real or not) to 1000 db above normal (I'm talking to you, Rachel Weisz!). And the end was SOOOOOOO predictable."
4,Great Movie!!!,My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. Something different for a change. I am so sick of the same story lines in movies. I don't want to write much because I don't want to give anything away. It is a really good movie:) watch it!
5,One of my favorite movies,I saw this several years ago and bought the movie. Really good movie if you like heart-felt movies and I think it is well told. The cost of the BR was worth it to me. Good value!
3,"OK taste, very chewy",These bars taste ok. They are very chewy so the little bar last for more than a couple bites.
3,Not sure why this is so expensive,"I do not understand why a used version of this workout is so expensive. It is an ""okay"" workout, but exactly what it says ""not so tough"", not even for beginners. It does not flow well, which is true for many of the The Firm parts workouts, and the gratuitous ""instructor"" in between each segment bites into the cardio time and heart rate acceleration, if any."
2,Not Much for Hard Core Fishing Info.,"This book, like Humphrey and Shogren's, was a waste of money. It does nothing for me as an avid and expert trout angler of southeast Minnesota. Therfore, it would only be somewhat relevant to a person who doesn't know what a trout is."
2,Alanis' female liberalism is a facade,"It's a shame that so many women have been fooled (by Alanis and her marketing gimmicks) into thinking that she represents women's causes. The truth is, in an interview she actually referred to herself as a nymphomaniac. How's that for female liberalism?"
2,Alanis Morrisette CD,"It's a good CD, however the one I bought was all scratched up and none of the songs played all the way through without skipping."
5,A milestone album,"7 years after the fact, this album is still an amazing piece of art, a honest and telling reflection of life, hardships, and experiences, as heard through the music of the truly talented Alanis Morissette. Upon its release in 1995, this album made heads turn, and it continues to do so upon re-listening, over and over again. These songs are universal, and will always be, going down in rock history as a milestone album, and a milestone artist. Listen to it again, and you'll remember why you bought this album when it first came out. If you never did, it's long overdue."
1,Ironic?,"Hey, I didn't know that when things go from bad to worse that's irony; wait a minute, IT'S NOT. I believe it is called MISFORTUNE. And what's the deal with her consistent bitching/wining/moaning/complaining... . If she keeps it up she may well descend into self-parody."
3,You can only listen to this when you're mad.,"I listened to this for the first time with no expectations whatsoever, only hearing the song ""Ironic."" I got it because my friend always sang the words to ""You Learn"" and, though she isn't the best singer in the world, I could tell it was a good song.But when I got it, I was amazed at how angry it was. I listened to it a few times around, then put on a calmer CD.Warning: DON'T LISTEN TO THIS CD WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY. IT'S VERY DEPRESSING AND ANGRY."
3,"a good cd, but not varied enough","I bought this cd after only hearing a few of her songs on the radio, when I first got it I loved it, but the pessimistic feeling and unhappness that runs through the cd is too much for the cd to be something I'll listen to over and over"
4,A solidly popular CD,"Alanis managed to create an immensely popular CD despite her vocals (which do not compare to many better sounding female vocalists, a short list including Annie Lennox, Anne Wilson, Sarah McLachlan, and so on). Yet, perhaps the raw sound and feel of the album is what makes it so appealing. Alanis is not a solid vocalist, but that flaw is set against good rock and intense lyrics. The jury is out as to whether she will follow up on the success of this album, but this is a worthy buy in the ""angry rock"" category. For a more folk accoustic, check out Ani DiFranco, but be warned -- Ani's language can be worse than Alanis'."
5,Rock On Alanis!,"I have nothing to say but brilliant. This album is one of the best in history and will go down as a classic. She is truely the first lady of rage and this is evident in the track ""You Oughta Know"". I just don't know why her career has been going on a downhill ever since this release. I just hope she can make a great comeback because I really miss the old Alanis days."
5,excellent!!!,"I just want to congratulate Alanis on a job well done. The song 'You Oughtta Know' came out just when I needed it. I had recently broken up with a boyfriend, and the song describes it to a tee. She nailed how I felt, and how the breakup went. The song for me was very theraputic. I listened to it every day, and got over what that jerk did to me. The only thing I don't like is Alanis in concert. Stop with the retard, flapping your hands around ***t! It's incredibly annoying, and one of the only reasons that I would never go see her in concert. But other than that, she's awesome!"
3,A stepping off point in lieu of greater things to come,"This cd honestly grows tiring if listened to regularly. It is definitely good enough to be pulled off the shelf every couple of months and listened to another time, however. I love the energy on this album. I usually listen to it while working out, for the lyrics such as ""it's easier not to...so much easier not to...and what goes around never comes around to you"" drive me forward. I suppose my real problem with this cd is that Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is just so much better. While this cd has anger and wit, Supposed Former has an introspective quality that makes me think about myself in a new way every time i listen to it. Jagged Little Pill is a good album, but when picking one over the other, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie ranks high above this freshman effort."
1,"A Bad, Bad Cd","When i ordered this cd i was thrilled, when it came, i was depressed, this was one of the worst cd's i've ever wasted money on. two thumbs down! I thought, the songs were very bad, and i really hated her voice. I always wonder why i wasted the money on that cd."
1,like a cat singing into a fan,"This cd is just some idiot venting her mindless frustrations under the disguise of music. The lyrics are moronic and the voice has a screeching quality of excruciating proportions. She sounds like a cat with a digestive disorder singing into a fan. Stay away from this, unless you are experimenting with a new pain killer and wish to generate a massive headache for a trial."
1,garbage !,"This woman can't sing at all, adn is fooling everyone with her ""different"" appeal. Listen to this CD carefully: it is just plain boring."
5,This cd is absolutely amazing!,"I must say that Alanis Morissette is one of the most talented singer/performers out there! All though her voice may not be the most beautiful, she makes up for it by having wonderful intense lyrics and catchy song beats. Some people are completely against her singing, and I can understand that. Many people say that she has a bad, angry attitude, which is true. However, if your having a bad time with a boyfriend or life in general, and if your in the mood for something different from your Britney Spears or BSB, pick up this cd, you won't regret it. Still, if you know for a fact that you don't like Alanis Morissette, don't waste your time typing reviews that only criticize what you consider to be ""awful"" singing."
4,alanis is cool,"if you are looking for pop, don't buy this CD. if you are looking for some of the best music around with a dose of girlie angst, pick it up! Alanis has been my favorite since 1995, when Jagged Little Pill took her to the top of the charts. this album had not come out of my CD player since then (good I have a changer)this CD rocks. vintage A.M. at her greatest."
5,a gem,this was the first Cd I ever bought and was not a dissapointment. Having heard her tracks on the radio I bought this bby straight away. The songs are all pretty simple with a crisp drum beat and guitar and harmonica. Angst is not the right word probably sympathetic lyrics or atleast sympathetic for herself. It is an amazing album though perfect for coming home on a friday afternoon and giving the world the big finger to. Explicit lyrics. Huh?
5,Much better than Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,"I bought Jagged Little Pill almost as soon as it came out, and I'm glad I did. All of the songs but Mary Jane and Forgiven are excellent, and even those two are decent."
3,We oughta Know,"Alanis Morisette is right on. She has a good voice and writes great songs. But ""You Ought to Know"" was one of the most annoying, overplayed songs in recent history that really gave me a headache. It prejudiced me from liking any of her following work."
1,pendant,"can't review, as never recieved the pendant, as it was out of stock once I had bought it, although it didn't say so initially."
5,Indispensable!,"This is the paperback manual that originally came withThe Forgotten Realms Archives. It will come in handy for copy protection purposes, and to read the ""paragraphs"" referred to inside the older Gold Box games. There are now websites out there with all of this information readily available, but for a true retro gaming experience you can't beat the actual manual! There were also code wheels for a couple games, you will probably have to find those online as well."
3,"Just became a fan, but like their newer stuff better.","I just began my F.L's journey about a week ago when I purchased the ""Yoshimi"" (sp.?) album of which got me hooked. I than, a few days ago, decided to buy, through amazon, Clouds taste Metallic. I bought it because of the excellent reviews. I got it in the mail today and I have to say, although I only listened to it one time, I was a bit disappointed. Some of the songs are muffled and are not as ""Yoshimi-ish"" as I would have liked. You see, I like more laid back etherial Floyd like sound and this one just did not do it for me. I gave it 3 stars only because I have only listened to it once and realize it may grow on me. I can only hope. If someone knows of a more spacey Floyd-like F.L's album please let me know!!! Thanks!"
2,Not any new info here,"If you have ever watched any of the NHL videos with Messier clips, a lot of this information will look or sound familiar because it relies heavily on well-publicized newspaper stories. Some stuff was new to me regarding the Messier/Neilsen incident, but don't buy it based on that, not enough to justify it."
3,It's finally released!!,"How nice it was to browse through amazon to find that this forgotten gem has FINALLY been released on cd. In all honesty, Bitter Sweet isn't quite as good as Steps In Time, but the tracks Alone Without You, Platform One and 2 M.B. alone make this good reason to purchase this disc. Kind of odd though, now that this disc is released, it seems they've pulled Steps In Time from the offering. It's ashame the group didn't carry on, I believe there could have been a lot more to offer. Paul King's solo effort was a 2 star at best. But Bitter Sweet was definitely a bitter sweet ending for a band with a short lived history."
2,THE CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER,I THINK IS VERY DIDACTIC FOR MI I DO NEED MORE PRACTICE ON EVERY ITEM FOCUSIN IN EACH CHIL PROBLEMS DIFFERENT KIND OF EXERCISES WIL BE MORE INTERESTING FOR ME AND THE KID AND NOT TO BE MORE REPETING EVERY ITEM THANKS
5,Literature at its Finest,"Admittedly, I'm not a poetry person. I bought this book because it was required reading for a lit class I took. However, I devoured this book and loved every single poem within it. Tretheway has a quiet but strong presence, and the words she writes jump right off of the pages. It is beautifully and wonderfully written, and I highly recommend it, even for non-poetry people."
5,Great for the price,"I purchased about 6 of these binders for myself to use during the school year. I'm not very careful with my stuff and getting expensive Avery binders was just out of my current economic situation with college coming soon.These binders are well-built with metal rings that don't bend when you press on them. After having used them for about 7 months, they are starting to fall apart. On two of them, the corners are starting to shed apart and the cardboard is showing. On another two, the inside flaps that hold paper are starting to peel off of the inside cover of the binder. However, for less than two dollars each, I really can't complain.Thanks for reading!"
5,A Don't-Miss Hepburn Reading Experience,"Very few books on Hepburn have been written by people who even met her, let alone those who knew her personally. James Prideaux has been a close friend for many years. In his book you'll find a portrait of Hepburn that has not yet emerged: human, warm, eccentric AND egocentric certainly, but always, always, ALWAYS fascinating. You'll find here the star, but also the woman-complete with warts. If you want to find a Hepburn not available elsewhere, don't miss this one!"
2,MAJOR disappointment,"I have listened to this CD at least 10 times, and still can't find a track that grabs me. Compared to some of their other efforts (Stunt and Maroon are tops with me), this is pretty blah. I've been listening to - and enjoying - this group for years, but I think they missed the boat with this one."
2,Ugh! Another listless cd.,My favorite band is on its third uninspiring cd. The christmas effort????? Terrible. This cd is just not up to the standard of Marooned and niether were the previous two. Disappointed again.
3,Not Bad,"I liked Everything To Everyone (and all the previous albums), but this one was slightly disapointing. It is still a good BNL album and worth the purchase, but it is a slower tempo album than most of their previous efforts."
2,Way to fast!,My husband and I watched the video first and were very disappointed by how quick it went through both subjects of puberty and sex. Especially on the topic of puberty and the menstrual cycle. I think $25 is way too expensive for a 15 minute video. The topic deserves much more explaination and graphics.
1,"Too short, not worth the amount of money I spent","Video was too short, the video was partially cartoon when talking about the serious matters and my daughter did not have any questions. My daughter is 11."
5,Love it!,I love this product! It kept my little girl so warm when I would have to do a paper route in the middle of winter. It fit my huge stroller just fine! I would recommend this!
5,Informative and interesting,"The author of Marching Through Culpeper has masterfully woven the rich history of this key Civil War town into an interesting and enjoyable story. Once I started the book, I was hooked. I highly recommend this book for those who wish to learn what life was like for the residents of a small town in the center of the action of one of the world's most savage dramas."
5,Buy This Book!,"As a voracious reader, collector, and enthusiast of The Late, Great Unpleasantness, have devoured hundreds upon hundreds of well written books. This is undoubtedly the best researched and most entertaining of all. If you plan to buy only one book this yer, let it be ""Marching Through Culpeper."""
2,Remember this is fiction,"People knowledgeable of the Civil War will recognize the latitude the author has taken with facts in creating her quaint romantic novel. But those for whom their only interest in history is through fiction may be under the impression that this is a true story, which it is not."
2,Poor quality,Has scratches and a spot which looks like someone tried to cover up a blotch. Also had a spot where it is smoother which indicates it was sanded - likely to cover up other worse scratches.
4,Worth the price,"Rack did not fit into space in which I wanted to use it. Had to disassemble and reassemble part of it and was very easy to do so. Fits perfectly now, attractive appearance."
3,Nice but wobbles.,"I was looking for a space saving wine rack and this one was also shown in a vertical position to save even more space. From the picture, $50 bucks didn't seem to bad but once I got it I felt like I overpaid somewhat. Looks like it should be worth about $30; no more than $40. It still seemed nice enough for the area I was putting it in so I set it up in a vertical position, but it wobbles! Horizontally it sets fine, but that takes up entire area where I want to place it. A small furniture wedge helped set it right, but I'm disappointed that I have to do so. Also I would be very careful with it. The wood seems to scuff very easily."
3,No surprises on Dwight Live CD,"If you are a Dwight Yoakam fan, ""Dwight Live"" will give you pretty much everything you want in a live concert CD. But, because it is a ""live"" album, the sound quality isn't as great as a studio recording, and Dwight's performance is not as sharp as if he was in the studio. And it makes a difference, because Yoakam's unique sound and musicianship definitely benefits from high-quality recording and engineering."
2,Disappointing ...,"This live album is a disappointment. Dwight Yoakam'sbest studio work has crystal clear sound (vocals andinstruments) and lively energetic arrangements.Unfortunately, Dwight never seems to get in thegroove during the concert[s] and his performanceis lackluster. Another disappointment is that thesound quality is poor, even for a live album. Theredeeming qualities are the choice of some of hisbest songs and his band is in good shape. Standoutsare ""Lonesome Roads"" and ""A Thousand Miles FromNowhere."""
4,Vocalist Lee Wiley Revisted,"I was first introduced to Lee Wiley by way of a series of 45rpm records that featured the first 8 tracks of this CD, over 50 years ago. To hear her again singing those same numbers in such splendid fidelity, was a pure joy. Add the additional 16 tracks of numbers I had never heard recorded by her, makes it a treasure for any Wiley admirer."
4,Great but Not Ellroy's Best,"I hadn't read any of these pieces before, and I dug most of them, especially ""Body Dumps"" and ""Hush-Hush."" Occassionally, the repetition that comes from each of these stories being originally published seperately becomes tiresome (He mentions his mother's death in almost every nonfiction piece). Not quite as good as The Black Dahlia or My Dark Places, but Ellroy's still the best in the biz."
3,"Inconsistent, but fun...","Over the past few months, i've devoured every one of Ellroy's books that I could get my hands on. However, the only pieces here that I felt stood out where the ""Hush Hush"" and ""Dick Contino"" stories."
5,"""Lift Up Your Voice""","I purchased this music when it was first recorded in 1995, (audiotaped version), and it was awesome then. Now, fourteen years, and a family later, I am thankful that it was still available, though out of print. This music is even more meaningful to me now as it was then. It is the simple things in life that are the most precious......a song in your heart.....praise on your lips. A worthwhile investment."
3,Description Wrong on Size,"Manual says this microwave is 24""(W) x 13/ 3/8"" (H) x 19 1/8"" (D) not 39"" long as stated in dimensions.[...]"
3,"photos nice, text is ""snobbish""","I just finished ""reading"" and viewing this book and was very much surprised to find such condescending views. The author speaks about how to not look like a tourist when lining up on the boat docks, that certain construction workers are referred to as ""Carharts"", and generally gives a less than flattering description of most people that visit or work on the island. Although the photos can be interesting or beautiful, I really felt as though the author tarnished the essence of the book with trivial matters such as those mentioned above. If one has to worry about how his ""year-round islander"" neighbor might view him because he was on the boat dock more than five minutes waiting for a ferry, that's pathetic.Summary: photos are great, some subject matter ruins the pleasant feelings one gets from viewing the photos."
5,Perfect,"I purchased several of these long sleeve tees for my husband to wear under his polo shirts during the winter. Because the price was so reasonable, I was worried the shirts would be cheap. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, given the price. Word of caution, they shrink considerably in the washer and dryer. When I first saw them, I suspected I ordered them too large UNTIL I washed and dried them. The length, in particular, shrunk quite a lot. I ordered white, navy and black. The darker colors did not fade at all upon the first washing...again, a pleasant surprise. Medium weight, they are good for wearing under another garment."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON CABLE BOX - BEWARE,"The 1183 Media Center remote will not work with the Verizon Cable Box. Without the remote working, the 1183 will not function with the Media Center, so the buyer is stuck with ""Win TV"" - basically, what you can get for $29, and not the $100 required for 1183. Google the ""Hauppauge 1183 and Verizon Box Problem"" and you will see hundreds of complaints of which Hauppauge denies exist. Check it out before you go through the hassle of buying and somehow having to return in unopened packaging to obtain a refund."
4,Geek Heaven,"Pros- Easy to assemble and install when directions followed.Cons- Maybe this is my fault but it wasn't until we got serious about siting that we realized we did not have a really good spot for wind speed and direction anywhere on our property. We are still always within about 20% of the wind speed and direction of our local tv station and maybe that is pretty good but I was a little dissapointed by that. Also, the directions were a little obscure about orienting things for wind direction readings but maybe that would be self-evident for the more advanced weather buffs this seems to be intended for. The included info display panel is a little hard to read but ok. I very highly recomend the PC interface software for a much more satisfying weather/data geek experience."
4,A CLIFF NOTES OF JEWISH HISTORY,"This is a great book, a kind of Cliff Notes of Jewish history from bibical times through to the modern world. No tpoic takes over a few pages and as written by Gilbert it is a pleasure to read."
2,Only Sporadically Engaging,"Given the project's prosaic (and that's being generous) script, I cannot imagine how such a talented cast was assembled. ""Barry Munday"" is a sadly lifeless affair; and that is a shame."
4,It's Worth It Just For the Sound Clips,"The TOMMY BOY SOUNDTRACK consists of mostly alt-rock tunes and sound clips from the movie. There's also ""Superstar"" by The Carpenters and that Spanish song, ""Eres Tu"". Personally, I think the soundtrack is worth owning just for the movie sound clips. I love the movie and I bought the soundtrack solely because of all the sound clips included: 8 of the 20 tracks are sound clips from the movie, including ""Lalaluukee"", ""Fat Guy in a Little Coat"", ""Housekeeping"", and ""My Pretty Little Pet"". Besides the sound clips and ""Superstar"" the only other song I really like from the album is ""It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"" by R.E.M. I think this album will be enjoyed by anyone who likes the movie TOMMY BOY and anyone who likes alt-rock music and if you happen to be a person who really is into both of those things, then you'll probably love this soundtrack."
4,A rare find,"Felt like I hit pay dirt when I found this album was on cd. Had the album back in the day and loved it. Couldn't get enough of ""Keeping love new"" and ""So fine"". Wish Howard Johnson stayed the course in the music industry-seemed to have fell off after this album but oh well, this is good enough."
2,Frustratingly cheap.,"After days of teaching myself to play via the Internet I was finally able to change the notes, but the instrument was only visible in my own head - no one else could hear me play at all. The product is extremely cheaply produced, and it is hard to keep from bending the metal prongs so that the vibrating tongue buzzes against the sides. Much too quiet."
1,At $4.98 it's about $20 too much,"With these you get even less than you pay for, and that's saying something. The difference between one of these and even a mediocre instrument is astonishing. As someone who's played some of the very best instruments of this type, the mere thought of the ""Snoopy's Harp"" sends chills up my spine. And that's not some sort of snobbery: I'm all for inexpensive when it works. But these are simply unplayable: poorly made and with a design that would be lousy even if it were well made. If you want to play jaw harp don't waste your money on this item, but instead find one from a reputable make (my personal favorite is Zoltán Szilágyi in Hungary)."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.,"Bikini Girls on Dinosaur Planet was just appallingly bad. I mean, they must have actually tried to make this thing this bad. I could have overlooked the threadbare plot and horrible dialog if the sex scenes were good, but they would have to be about 9000 percent better just to be considered okay.The bonus movie, Bikini Goddesses, was better. And it was still horrible as well. In fact, some of the trailers that were included in the extras section were better than both of the movies put together.I strongly do not recommend this one."
1,Worst Golf Related Book I Have Ever Read!,This Cinderella is a real pumkin. Murray could have shown a little more effort in trying to give the read his/her money's worth. I feel Murray riped me off and wasted my time!
2,Bill should try illustrating instead of writing...,"I thought Bill went off on some rambling tales that made little sense. The book was funny at times and the photos were great, but it was difficult to follow the entire tale. If Bill was given the opportunity, I think he would be better at illustrating a children's book of poetry instead. I hear he has an artistic side, and I would like to see how he would draw. His appearance on Letterman promoting this book was enjoyable. If he was offered the chance to collaborate on some children's poems, I'd really be interested to see his creative sparks fly. I'd also be interested in reading a book by Bill about his involvement with the Saint Paul Saints..."
1,Ugh,"I wanted to love it and found that I could only tolerate it. Funny bits here and there. Otherwise, rough."
2,Yikes! This was BAD....,"I was at the local library looking at books in the golf section. I've read a couple by Tommy Armour and one by Ben Hogan, both were good and informative.I saw three copies of this Murry prose on the shelf. Thought, hey this should be good and interesting. I quickly noticed that all 3 copies had not been creased, thus unread.Went and sat down and started reading.....then my mind started to wonder...then I flipped through and looked at the pictures....then quickly returned the book to the shelf. Bill, stick with the game itself and leave the word processor to sending quips to Chevy.The stories did not grab me, the humor was non-existant, and there were very little facts that I could grasp of interest.I did like the movie Caddyshack, but Dangerfield stole that show, Carl the groundskeeper didn't really do much for me as a character or make me laugh. Sorry Bill, but Stripes was cool :)2 stars for the pictures."
3,A slice of litigious medieval French life,"Ms. Wroe has come upon a seeming wealth of untouched historical data in the form of Rodez's archives. Unfortunately, she stresses the story of a pot of gold at the beginning of the book but never sticks to that main stream. She uses the ""story"" to bring in all sorts of fascinating information about business and social life in this French town, but these tangents don't bring us any closer to resolving her main story-line.As earlier reviewers have stated, perhaps she should have stepped over that line into historical fiction where she could use the business and social history of the town, as well as the main idea concerning the pot of gold and constructed a fine fictional tale that would have been more pleasing, as well as having better flow.A useful book for the information on business, law, and society in this unique town, but don't buy it expecting to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
4,Micro-history....a fine tour of daily life during a long war,"Ms. Wroe has done readers a great service in bringing to life the partitioned town of Rodez during the 1300s. This is the type of historical writing that actually permits you to experience the daily life of a city beleagured by the ""English,"" who behaved more like roving gangs than soldiers of the Crown, an image difficult to infer from the conventional textbooks that focus on macro-level, sweeping events. I much prefer this to the historical novel. While such novels always have a grain of truth; it is much more difficult to ascertain where fiction ends and nonfiction begins. Wroe uses her imagination, to be sure, but she is following archival material and, as a result, we are given allowed the opportunity to see part of an era and its people that might well have escaped our view."
4,A promising beginning,"I read the sequel to this novel first, and while I liked the sequel better, it was still a treat to go back and experience these characters in the first blush of their romance. I'm perfectly willing to concede the points of other reviewers that this author has written stronger fiction. In addition, if you are reading this primarily as a mystery novel, you are doomed to disappointment. This author uses the ""mystery"" aspects more to add a bit of flavor to her characters and their lives, than to confound the reader and keep them guessing until a clever ending.The main editing issues have also been brought up in other reviews, but as far as a contribution to the genre, I find that Gina has a really fresh voice. I enjoy the way she uses language, and her well-crafted sentences. I think I like the strong character progression we're given in the 2nd book more, but this book laid an excellent foundation, and is one I will undoubtedly read again."
2,Unexpected sparks fizzles fast,"Honestly, I love lesbian romance novels, but this was unfortunately one of the lamest I've ever read. The mystery aspect was completely based on overhearing conversations, and had not substance to it at all. You could completely predict ""who did it"" before you got 1/4 of the way through the book. The romance dialogue was sophomoric at best. It took me forever to get through it, it was drudgery. I kept hoping something better might happen, it didn't. Save your time - pick something else."
5,Excellent Antivirus,"I have been testing this antivirus during two months and i definitely recommend it. Sometimes i have had some problems with my network connection after the antivirus is updated, but i disconnect and connect the network card and the problem is fixed."
5,Excellent work,I got a copy of the book recently and have just finished the first chapter and the book reads really clearly. I always thought the battles in the Bible were boring but this book makes them exciting. I don't mind the fact that the authors are not afraid of expressing their views and coming at things from their political slants. I hope there are other books on the subject as good as this one.
3,Good overview and some useful advice,"This book provides a good overview, but not a lot of detail on malicious code. It's more of a policy-based approach to defending against these threats."
5,Terrific,"I just finished reading this terrific novel. It's smart, hilarious, and beautifully written. It's also a rarity -- a ""boy book"" that women will love. Hank, the good kid, is about as appealing a character as you'll ever run across, while Ralph, the prototypical terror, is scary and fascinating, and yet, finally, as vulvernable as any other boy. In a series of linked stories, we follow these two into adulthood. Each piece stands on its own, but the cumulative effect packs a wallop. Oh -- also -- the depiction of Chicago's working-class South Side was so vivid it made me wish I had grown up there, too. John McNally is the real deal."
2,THIS IS THE WORST GAME OF THE SERIES,"THE GRAPHICS AREN'T TOO GOOD, THE CARS LOOK GREAT BUT ARE LOADED WITH MORE HANDLING PROBLEMS THAN EVER BEFORE, AND THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS. LET'S FACE IT, THE ONCE-GREAT RIDGE RACER SERIES IS NOW DEAD. AND THIS IS THE GAME THAT HELPED SEAL ITS FATE."
3,"hard rocking Neil Young, perhaps more for PJ fans than those of NY?","I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who noted that any of the songs on this Cd would be a welcome addition to any other Neil Young recording but taken together they become uninteresting and monotonous (my words, not his). The drumming is uninspiring - bang, bang, thud thud, bang bang bang. Were the drums not so up front in the mix they wouldn't be so irritating. I love Neil Young and am a moderate fan of Pearl Jam (love Ten all the way through but prefer most of the band's Cds in small doses). I wanted to like this collaboration more than I do. This music isn't horrible (like that on Re-ac-tor and Landing on Water). It just doesn't grab me. Now if I were a big fan of PJ and a moderate fan of NY I suspect that I would feel differently. Throw Your Hatred Down is a great song and, indeed, to repeat myself, individually I do like most of the songs here. Maybe I just like Crazy Horse more as Young's back-up band."
3,Good but not as spectacular as i was hoping,"The cd is pretty decent but not as musically inspiring as I thought it would be.I think the music is a little to overshadowed by too many distorted guitars and fuzzy playing. I was hoping for more technical interplay between Mccready, gossard and Neil.The single I got ID with neil young was a better example of what could be between the group.All in All, its a pretty good cd but I think it could have been much better if they broke out some accoustical stuff along with all the overdose of grunge."
2,disappointment--pay attention to the bad reviews,"Before I got Mirror Ball, the only Neil Young cd I had was After The Gold Rush. I was interested in his rock music, so I got this. I was expecting a grunge masterpiece like everyone was describing, but I got a disappointment. If you've heard one song on here, then you've basically heard all of them. Sure there are plently of people who like this album, but check out the other reviews...maybe you will turn out to be one of the people that will be disappointed with Mirror Ball. Buy Neil's other albums before you think of getting this. It's not all bad...""I'm The Ocean"" is really good, but the album doesn't live up to just about everything else that Neil Young has done."
3,So this is This Smiths (?),"After hearing a few of their songs (and reading all these flaming reviews on Amazon), I went out and purchased my first Smiths album, this one. I hoped I would get the best of their work on 1 disc..and I don't know if I did. This collection was a mixed bag for me. I absolutely love the song ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out;"" it's probably one of my favorite songs ever. I also enjoyed ""The Boy With The Thorn In His Side,"" the classic ""This Charming Man"" and ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now."" However, I didn't care so much for about half of the album. I think it's a good CD to own if you want a more well-rounded music collection though. But don't take my word for it, have a go at it yourself."
4,good yoga dvd,Very good dvd and very good if you are a beginner or an intermediate user of the practice of yoga.I recommend this dvd and find Bob's style very useful especially with form.
3,Disappointed with the yoga aspect of this,"I have seen the Biggest Loser and Bob Harper does a lot of yoga on the show, leading me to expect this to be a good yoga workout. Unfortunately I did not enjoy Bob's yoga. I do not think it has a good form or flow. It does not give you the stretch and alignment it should. I would caution against doing this workout if you are unfamiliar with yoga as Bob does not do enough to explain good form or positioning, and also throws in a couple of advanced moves that could lead to injury in beginners. I would class this more as a strength workout using what look like yoga moves. That being said, it does give you a strength workout, and strengthen muscles you would use doing a real yoga workout!"
2,Music is a total distraction,"The music for this DVD seems mismatched, maybe it was a mistake? The workout itself is okay, could be more challenging and have better flow but the music really takes away even more from the pace and flow."
2,Meh,"I bought this video as a way to incorporate yoga and strength on days when I felt like changing things up a bit. I have many of Jillian's videos, some Biggest Loser videos and Bob's Pure Burn Strength video. This video was just okay, the yoga moves did not challenge me very much at all. This may be good for beginner's. And I don't consider myself advanced at all anymore now that I am back in school full time and work out maybe 3x per week. Now, am intermediate at best. I really like Bob, but this one was a little disappointing. I give it two stars because I don't like it and was not challenged. The title Yoga for the Warrior was deceiving."
2,useless for me,"I picked up a pair of these, and they're useless for anyone w/ any sort of punching power. Basically, they're useless for anyone under 10 years old. They come flying off whenever a shot lands."
2,Not so great :(,"I was very disappointed with this book. I expected that there would be actual examples/cases/cures in the book that were relevant to Edgar Cayce and Castor oil. The author tells of some of her patient's who were helped with certain things, but no details as to what she healed them with. This is not a healing guide, remedy or self-help book, it is more of a story. Too many chapters are describing how the author decided to become a doctor and the road she took to get there. Quite boring and not what you'd expect."
5,Man this is so addictive!,Ok the first day i got it i played ot for like 3 hours straight and the only reason people ever give it bad reviews is they say they are finished in 2 hours.Well then they must have not unlocked a whole bunch of extra stuff that you can set records on and then yell at your brother saying you beat his record.I have unlocked all but one mini game in about 3 weeks.I still set records for my brother to beat and of cours he always beats them but doesnt it sound fun?There are some pretty strange games like eat the banana and pick the nose.The graphics are meant to be cruddy cuz thats kind of how they were supposed to make it.Just buy it and yyou will be happy!
3,satisfied but would not buy again,this product is ok but the shower gel/shampoo does not lather well and for 36 bucks would expect a better product. The exfoliating scrub was a plus though.
3,Rhino Ramp,I bought this rhino ramp to use for my 5 series bmw. The sport suspension sits pretty low to the ground and steeper ramps don't work. Overall I able to get the car up on the ramps. The only negative is sometimes the ramps will move on you as try to drive up on them.
5,tinglie! koochi-q! i Smoochie it!,"I got this game for christmas from my parents and i've played it ever since. i is kindahard to beat but easy at the same time. i've bet it three times now but it is fun all the same. I needed cheats every once in a while. it is one of my three favorite GBA games; harvest moon: friends of mineral town, hamtaro: ham-ham games, and last but not least, Hamtaro: ham-ham heart break.thank-Q! Bye-Q!"
3,I wish it was better,"I love Wallace and Gromit. I couldn't wait to play this game. However, I am disappointed. I found the graphics to be very well done, but the camera jumps so much that every time I play, I get motion sickness. Sometimes the camera jumps so much that you walk right off of platforms. It doesn't save automatically so if you forget, get ready to replay. I would still buy it, however, I would wait until the price drops..."
1,Who is teaching here?,"I find it interesting that the author of this book is a woman and is, therefore, *teaching* the men who have left reviews here. They are thankful for all they have learned from *her* about the Scriptures."
3,There may be some inaccuracies,"The writeups on the hikes are entertaining and informative. There is a considerable amount of history, botanical, and geological information here. I have found that when hiking the descriptions are not always accurate. Some of the landmarks, for example, didn't seem to be where they are explained. Also, some of the color markings for certain trails are either inaccurate or outdated. I recommend it as a good place to start for suggestions on places to hike. However, I would try to obtain more up to date maps or guides of the specific areas you're interested in before venturing out."
5,People please,"Come On! This book is 20 years old and people are reviewing it as if it's new! DUH! This book needs to be taken off the list, but Amazon doesn't want to do that, and why? Because they still have books to sell. Nevermind the fact that it draws stupid reviews from all sorts of idiots who think that material this old should still be accurate. Duh, Duh, duh, people."
2,Unmaintained Trails,"I can't fully judge this book yet, but if the first hike we did was any indication, this book isn't worth it. We tried the Storm King hike (#9 I believe), and there was no trail to speak of. We managed to trail blaze a way up to the top of Butter Hill, but could not find the supposed yellow blazed trail at all. After searching for over an hour, we gave up and headed back. Very disappointed."
5,Clip it and smoke! It's that easy.,I bought this to aid my cigar smoking on the golf course. Clips perfectly to my golf bag or to the cart and secures cigar nicely.
5,Great Item,My husband and all of his golf buddies now have this. Was thrilled to find it at this price as I have seen them other places for double.
5,great product,"click on my cart very easy and secure. clip hold the cigar tight but not damage the cigar, very good product."
3,Cigar Minder cigar clip,"Good product and works great. However, the coil spring that operates the cigar holding part of the mechanism is flimsy. I have been using the product for about five years and have gone through at least a dozen clips. Once the little coil spring breaks, the holder is useless."
1,DISBELIEF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"if someone has time can someone please breakdown the whole story of the lawsuit the world wildlife fund against the the world wrestling federation, why & when did it start & and what caused it, why they are allowed to say ""world wrestling federation"" but are not allowed to say ""wwf"", and why do they have to blur the attitude scratch logo but do not blur the other older ones like the block logos. would really love to know."
1,5+3+1=? stars,"Why would five, three and one star reviews average out to a four and a half stars? Is there something wrong with my math as I know it? (The 5/3/1 stars are obviously before my input here..)"
5,Got ground cable?,"Great quality product, fast shipment. I picked up the same gauge power line as well to run power to my winch on my truck."
1,Uninteresting life,"I'm sorry. I looked forward to this book because...well, I like dukes and I thought this duchess would be interesting. But I couldn't get through the first chapter and immediately put it in the books to go to Goodwill. If you liked it, more power to you, just not my cup of high tea."
4,Excellant game for shooting.,"Point Blank 2 is definitely all about shooting! Not a bunch of juvenile story nonsense, just a bunch of shooting. Some truly interesting challenges for just about every aspect of shooting, rapid fire, single shot, moving targets, you name it. No recoil management or extreme accuracy, though. The guncon technology doesn't support either one.The only drawback is the long time that it takes between stages to evaluate the results and the clunky controls to get to the next stage or to repeat a stage. Oh yeah, and the terrible music."
5,Phenomenal,"Mike Oldfield rocks you to the other dimensions and back. I highly and dearly recommend this cd, nothing else compares to it!"
5,Somthing MORE than music,"I can't quite explain this, but this music reminds you of the importance and deep comunication power that music can have. As with the great composers music, this reaches right in to the very soul, it's like the chords are in resonant frequency of existence itself! Outstanding!"
2,No save option,"No save option in game, instead you need passwords. If you think this game is like the old PC based Pirates Gold, you are wrong. This game is mission based and boring to this gamer seeking a portable Pirates Gold clone."
2,a waste of money-sort of,"If you are looking for a game with characters that look like the movie's, don't buy this one! The graphics are not that bad in general, but the character portrayals are awful. Some of the levels become boring after about a minute, if you are still playing the level at the end of a minute. If you want a game that follows the movie's story line, this is not the game for you."
4,Even the adults were enthralled,"I bought two of these kits for entertainment over Thanksgiving, and everyone thought they were awesome. The kids loved it, but the biggest fan turned out to be grandma. The geyser shot up between 25-30 feet, and it worked perfectly both times. The pieces in the kit are simple but made well. Enough candies come with the kit to do the experiment twice (you'll need two bottles of soda to use them all). I'm glad I got this version of the kit instead of the eepybird one, because this is much cheaper."
1,Four failed attempts in a row!,"I bought this for my children last summer. I also bought two things of Diet Coke and extra Mentos. We tried two in a row, the first one shot out the sides and the second one tipped over. No cool geyser tower. We were very disappointed.So again I purchased two things of Diet Coke and two things of Mentos. First time it shot out the side and the second time I made sure it was as tight as tight can be and the Mentos got stuck in the tube! I tried to get them down but it was too late a couple had already gone down in and I couldn't get them to drop down fast enough to do anything other than you could accomplish by shaking up the bottle!All in all it was very disappointing. Especially since we've watched the YouTube videos. We just can't seem to catch a break and I'm all done trying."
2,Too lightweight,"Some reviewers called it (Chrome Brushed Magazine and Toilet Paper Stand (Chrome) (24""H x 10.5""W x 3.5""D)) flimsy; I'll just call it lightweight. Without a big book in it, it would topple over if you put too much power into your toilet paper pull. It was neither as hefty nor as clever a design as the same company'sInterdesign 68600 Toilet Paper Roll Reserve Holder, which I have. I was disappointed & returned it."
2,Cleaning freak,Although I've not completed this book I have found that it contains text that isn't relevent and just pads the book out. It's difficult enough to find time to read books without having to wade though loads of rubbish!
5,Great Music,"Whether you like the movie or not the assembled sound track is worth listening to in it's own right. Mellow sounds and a good selection of jazz. The title of the theme is a bit strange "" Doe Eyes"" only because it doesn't obviously relate to any particular scene in the movie. Unless it can be interpreted as the longing for something more both characters need in their lives. But as stated good mellow listening regardless of enjoyment of the movie."
2,anachronistic,"while a well researched and argued piece, this book fails its readers as an anachronistic piece of scholarship. the ""key pillars"" of judicial integirty that the author negatively defines contemporary canadian jurists against crumbled long ago into the dust of ozymendias.while self-evident that everyone should wish to support a judiciary that sports both honesty and integrity, the authors true intention is to butress a school of legal philosophy that is over 100 years old. these formalist and positivist notions of legal decision making and knowledge building are as dead as notions of national homogenaity and elitist decision making. further, it is ridiculous to attempt to dichotomize the legal system from politics, as does this book, because they are one and the same. understanding how that relationship should be re-articulated is the work of future scholars. this book is the work of one whose time has passed."
5,Incredible!,"Cascada's first official single is just incredible! This song makes you want to dance forever, and for those who want to hear a slower version, the mix is incredible!"
3,Steamfast steamer,The handle does get hot when in full operation.Could handle wrinkles better. Not a big fan of thismachine
3,Decent,"Hose is very short!! Your arms do get get tired after a while. Beware you do need to use distilled water which isn't mentioned anywhere on this site. Overall, its a decent product."
4,Good for the price,"You can spend a lot on steamers. This one is perfect for what I was looking for. Produces steam quickly and easily removes common wrinkles. Difficult to press clothes, but if you're just looking to smooth them out, especially fine garmets, I recommend this steamer."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,Gave this as a gift. The received tried it out and I am now returning it because it doesn't do its job. It just spits out water.
4,Works,Seems to work well post kind of short and light duty still works really well. I'd buy another one when this wears out.
3,Good product- broke down after year and a half,This product was doing a great job for it's size however after less than two years it suddenly stopped generating steam. We were careful to clean out the inside using vinegar per instructions.
2,Quit working after two days of heavy use,"I bought this steamer in October 2011 to steam garments and linens used in a relative's wedding. It got a good work out for two days using only distilled water as instructed. I drained the unit and dried it as well as I could and stored it in a closet until last weekend (August 2012)when I pulled it out to steam some shirts. It worked for about five shirts before it began cycling off and cooling down every minute or so. It would steam a minute and then I would have to wait for it to get hot enough to produce steam again. Eventually, it quit steaming altogether. If you're looking for a disposable steamer, this one did a great job first time around. I was not looking for a disposable steamer, so I'm not all that excited about its performance any longer. (At least it made it through the wedding.)"
3,Great little steamer but some issues,"This steamer is on the smaller side, but it gets the job done. I got it as a gift and have had it for over a year now.PROs: It heats up incredibly fast (some here have said under a minute; in my experience it's closer to 2 or 3 from a cold start), is effective, and is easy to use. Emptying and filling the reservoir are easy. No dripping, which has been an issue for me with past steamers.CONs: There seems to be some on/off action that is either automated, or just completely random, with the steaming action here. It will be producing steam, and then when I start using it on a garment the steam slows to a trickle (of steam, not water) until I put it back on its cradle again. Then it starts up again and I have to start again with the next garment. Why it won't produce continuous, strong steam, I'm not sure. The pole isn't very high, and the brake-free wheels mean that this guy is gonna follow you around.Not a bad choice, but I think I could have done better."
1,Died in 1 year,I bought this product based on the good reviews but it died in the first year.It was good when it worked and produced hot steam.
4,Works fast on clothes!,"I have a shirt that took me 40mins to iron on low, and I steamed it in less than 5mins with this baby! I was hesitant to buy a steamer because I feel like they're so much slower than irons on thicker fabrics, but this also worked super fast on a jersey shirt that I have-- I only had to go over each part once.The only downside is it did not work AT ALL to clean my mattress. Somebody told me that garment steamers helped clean upholstery and such... I'm not sure if that's true, but this one didn't."
2,"good in beginning, but doesn't last","very good in the beginning. they recommend buying distilled water for it, but it just doesn't make sense coz it uses a lot of water. so i clean it out with vinegar every now and then as they said is required on their manual due to mineral deposit if you're using tap water. after about 9 months, it starts to start and stop on its own. probably over heat. warranty is only for 1 year. i clean it out some more and it works for 2 times, then by about 14 months, no matter how much i try to clean it out with vinegar, it won't steam any more. the hose and the unit is hot to touch, but no steam come out. at this point i can't even use vinegar to clean it coz the vinegar water just sits in the tank and won't steam up. i now need to buy a new one, of another brand."
3,"Worked well, broke after 1 year of using though","The steam comes out really fast, about 1 minute one can start ironing. The height can be adjusted to about 2-3 feet for storage to save space. The tube is very stiff and I wish it would be a little softer to move around.This product has a short life time though. It has been a year + 5 months, and after about 5-6 times of use, the long black steam tube connected to the base suddenly broke off due to rubber wear and tear. It would be impossible to glue back as the contact area is just a thin circle. At first, I was thinking to contact the manufacturer for consumable part replacement, but the manual says a one-year warrantee, mine just passed it. I wish it could last longer; for sure I will search for a more durable brand."
1,Bought brand new and does not work out of the box.,"When I received this steamer, it was brand new. I open the box and set everything up and there's no steam. I know I set it up right. I read the instruction and it says it takes about 40sec for the heater to heat the water, but its been about 40 mins already and yet no steam."
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT,"I purchased this item almost a year ago andI love it! It heats up so fast, ready to go inseconds. Does a great job! Small enough to put in mycloset so it is always handy when I need to quicklygo over a garment. I am going to get my sister one forchristmas, she saw how quickly it worked on a party dressI steamed for my niece and was amazed at how great it worked.I hate ironing and since I have had the steamer, my ironingboard has not been out of the closet!"
1,"After a month, only creates steam for 30 seconds","I bought this about 2 years ago, and still regret it. It works well for about 30 seconds, then it just stops producing steam. The reservoir is full, the switch is on and lit up, and the handle is up high, but it just stops steaming. It's very frustrating when two people need a shirt steamed before a night out, and you have to speed through them to make sure you have enough time to get both done before the steam stops flowing. Other people have complained about this so I know the one I have is not just broken."
4,"Use distilled water, not hard tap water.","The water is very hard where I live. I thought filtering it with a Brita would help, but it doesn't. It failed within 5 months (there was so much sand and debris in my steamer!) This occurred outside Amazon's return period, so I called Steamfast and explained what happened. They told me hard water was a problem, filtering wouldn't help, and MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY WOULD SEND ME A NEW STEAMER (after emaiing them pictures of what happened). I use distilled water now (sorta pricey at $1.30 a gallon) to steam my clothes. It works well now, and hopefully there won't be any more problems.I figure this was sorta my fault, so despite this I would recommend this product as a budget steamer."
1,completely disappointed,"My hand held steamer developed a leak in the seam where the plastic halves connect, so I got this steamer to replace it. What a complete disappointment. The water only lasts long enough for three items of clothing, the pole is six inches too short, when you try to do the cuffs of pants you can't because the hose folds in half, and the hose gets hot because it's not insulated. I do not recommend this steamer."
1,Disappointed,"I read all of the raves here and decided to purchase this steamer for my dress shirts. I don't have curtains or any other fabrics to steam so I can't comment on this steamer's performance in those areas.Pros: Does heat up quickly, in around 30 seconds or less. Takes up less space than a fold out ironing board.Cons: Needs distilled water. Does not do a good job removing wrinkles from my men's dress shirts that I hang dry. I had to make multiple passes with the steamer to even have a noticeable affect on some wrinkles. Other wrinkles would not come out no matter how long I steamed them, while also pulling on the fabric. If you're looking for something to give your shirts that crisp, sharp look from ironing and dry cleaning, this won't do it (At least it didn't for me)."
1,manufacture flaw,the valve at the bottom was defective so the entire contents of water spilled everywhere. couldn't use the product even once.
5,Perfect Steamer for all jobs including drapery,I bought this to steam heavy weight curtains in my bedrooms.It heats up quickly and works perfectly. The design is greatand collapsible for storage. Light weight as well for easymovement while steaming.Great Product Great Price
4,Decent Machine,"The machine gets ready really quickly. I think under 1 minutes its ready to go.Easy to set up and store. Easy to operate.The additional pad is helpful.Things to look out/improve on.- There isnt instructions in how to steam clothing - its harder than you think.- There's a problem with what you do with the extra water in the machine after you are done. Its like a humidifier, if you just leave the water in the machine you will be growing a lot of stuff. Would be nice if there's some way to get rid of the water in a easier fashion."
1,steamfast SF 407 1500w fabric steamer,"I have bought this product from amazon USA and want to use it in the UK howvever it has arrived with american plug and is 120volts, anybody be able to advice what i need to do? I can be inboxed to michelle_burke1@sky.com"
1,"One thing for sure, shirts dont come out pressed!","I bought this product so that my shirts will look somewhat pressed, well let me save you the time and effort:If your buying this to have a easy way to get your shirts to look pressed, DONT BUY IT! It doesn't work AT ALL for shirts. maybe for drapes its a good product, i dont know , didn't try, but this def wont press your shirt, or look remotely pressed!The youtube video of this is misdirecting, they make it sound like this should work for shirts, when it doesnt work at all!"
1,Disappointed,It was visible that the box was opened before and to top it off the product was damanged. The pole was denrted to the point it can not be used. I dont even want an exchange I needed item for sunday and now I have to return it due to poor quality of the product.
1,The hose get too hot,"The hose that leads to the handle gets too hot because it's cheaply made of rubber without any fabric covering. Very disappointed, had to return it."
3,"Not Morrissey's best work, but still OK.","The first song on this album, ""Teachers are afraid of the pupils"" is arguably the worst song Morrissey has ever made in his career, it's painfully long and seems like he's venting. I hope he felt better! ""Reader meet author"" is an excellent song and is the album's best. ""The operation"" is another good song and is also quite humorous. I personally find ""Boy Racer"" and ""Dagenham Dave"" to be very annoying songs and all the other songs to be much more listenable."
4,Medicine for my Mind and Body,"I checked this book out of my local library out of curiosity and because I had been having aches and pains. I felt there must be something more I can do than take aspirin all the time. I started reading this book and doing some of the exercises and immediately began to feel better. I decided to purchase this book from Amazon so I would always have it as a reference. The simplicity and illustrations in the book are well received. I recommend Mr. Kent's book to anyone who wants to get a handle on their health, spirit and mind."
5,Must have mixer!,"I've wanted a KitchenAid stand mixer for years, but didn't feel it was worth the investment. My friend, who is an accomplished baker, told me it was a must have in the kitchen, so I put it on my birthday list. My husband bought me the Accolade as a gift about 2 months ago. It's wonderful. It makes a little more noise than my friends Artisan, but the gears will last a lifetime. My friend recommended The Mixer Bible cookbook to go with it, just to familiarize me with the mixer and introduce me to all the attachment possibilities. That was a great investment, as I feel like I'm more ""in the know"" now, and all the recipes are great too."
5,Love It!,"I bought mine about a year ago. I use it more than I thought I would. I used to make bread in a bread maker, but now I use the mixer. I can make 2 loaves at once. I purchased the grinder attatchment to grind my own meat. It's much healthier and less expensive than buying store ground meat. It's also great for making ""real"" whipped cream!"
3,shoddy but tolerable,"The very first line of the book ""On 24 April 1877 Tsar Nicholas II declared war on the Ottoman Empire"" shows how shoddy and rushed this book was. Alexander II was the Tsar at that time. Nicholas wasn't crowned until 1894. The book is filled with maddening errors like that as well as ommisions and weaknesses like plate commentaries that don't describe the uniforms in the referenced plate at all.But still a somewhat worthwhile attempt since there are so few books on the subject."
3,Great Calendar..BUT....,"This is a great calendar for Braves fans. There is one tiny, little problem. Half the guys in the calendar have been traded or released. Unfortunately, the months with LaRoche, Giles, Ramirez, and Reitsma will be in memory of Braves past. I suppose you could tape a new picture over the old ones."
3,Call it a 2.5 rounded up,"I like Wallace and Grommit. I don't like Wallace and Grommit the game so much. The graphics are decent and the sound is ok overall with some fluctuations. This isn't really an adult game which is surprising because it gets very hard at times...way too hard for kids. Kids don't play this game with an adult, because you will hear alot of cussing. Now for the biggest problem the camera angles....yeahhhh! The camera has a mind of its own sometimes....a big detraction from the gameplay."
1,WARNING,"I knew NOTHING about video games, I bought this game for my son, I'm divorced, and his father has an xbox 360, we both thought the games worked for all xbox systems, but they do not, and so now this game is useless to us, so just a warning, don't buy this game unless you have the right xbox system"
3,If you like the movie you'll probably like the game - if you like games.,I bought this for my son - he's 6 1/2. He has tons of xbox games and he really loved the movie so i thought i'd give this a try. He likes the game a lot. It sounds like the characters. The tasks are not impossible so there's not a lot of freaking out lol I thought this was a good game. Probably not one that a teenager who's into shooting and race car driving would like though.
2,Can we fix it?!? Apparently not...,"It's ironic that this is a Bob the Builder toy, because it certainly isn't very well built. My 2-year-old loves the lights & sounds, but we can't let him play with it because he can completely disassemble it without even trying. (Yes, he's beneath the suggested age for this toy; it was actually bought for his older sister. But it's come apart in her hands, too; she's just old enough to know it's broken and ask us to fix it.) Oddly enough, for being so easy to take apart, it's quite difficult to put together.Also, the product description talks about turning sunflowers into products, and the picture shows a cute ball with sunflowers on it. The balls that came with our toy were plain yellow & green."
4,Murphy's Law -,"I enjoyed the first of I hope many adventures of Molly Murphy. The heroine, escaping the hangman's noose in Ireland, escapes to America by pretending to be the mother of two children whose mother is diagnosed with Tuberculosis. The description of steerage class, the organized chaos of Ellis Island and differences of the various parts of New York City are well done. Some of the characters seemed to fit a generic mold, but through Molly's eyes they take on a new life. Her ability to survive and thrive makes her an interesting and terrific heroine. Here's hoping that her dream of being a detective doesn't get thwarted by fate or Daniel Sullivan. I couldn't put the book down and wondered when will the next one come out. May Molly have a long and happy life!!!!"
4,"Lots of good, one problem for me","Liked the setting, the writing and main character, but wow, what a lot of coincidences. I don't mind one or even two in a story, but I lost count. Even before Molly Murphy arrives in NYC and keeps bumping into people she knows or needs to know, there's a huge coincidence that helps get her there in the first place. This became a big distraction for me, I'm afraid."
3,"Lays in the basic groundwork, but...","In my opinion this book fails to emphasize a very important aspect of horror writing - originality. William Nolan does a very good job describing the mechanics of horror (how to establish a sense of mystery, implication rather thahn description, how to make your character seem easy to harm, how to allow the reader to identify with the character, etc.), but the aftertaste of the book seems to tell that what it tells you to do is enough to be a successful writer. I wouldn't recommend continually referring to this book - it won't let you to develop your own style."
3,Be careful when taking a seat,"These chairs are 'just okay'. Fairly comfortable, but poorly made and require tightening of the screws often to prevent wiggling. Larger people may find these too fragile."
1,P U,Played for 30 min got bored took it back to the video store.Who ever came up with this idea for a game must have been on Geritol.
4,Interesting,i love the movie and the game is great and exciting except i wish it would be more of a shooter instead of just stealth and boring objuctives. i also wish you'd have more freedom in the levels not just doing objectives and moving on; the game goes really fast. Besides that the game is just what i expected. I'd give it a try if you like/are familiar with the movie otherwise don't beacuse you'd get confussed.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"As everyone before me has said: This book is absolutely horrible. There is no way that a student just learning data structures should be allowed to use this book. As a Dean's List student currently having to use it, I've found that the best way to study is that when the professor tells us to read Chapter 3 on lists, you browse the topics being presented, then actually study and learn the information from another textbook instead like books by Gaddis, Savitch, or Malik. This book is best left to be burned."
1,Confused,"This book is absolutely the worse book that I have ever seen for any course I have ever taken in college. From the start, this text is confusing. The author constantly makes useless points and wastes time on examples that are meaningless and spends little time, if any, on pivotal parts. Even my professor is finding errors in how the author structured her work and examples and is actually lecturing the author via email! For someone who already has a background in this field, this book is tolerable. But if a person is trying to learn this material for the first time, this book will leave a person confused and with even more questions than when they started. I'm considering using my old textbook for this course, because that one actually made sense in every aspect and was clear cut."
1,Mind numbing with a hint of confusion,"This book is one of the worse text books, I've ever owned. The text in itself is relatively confusing. The book is lengthy, though this might be a good thing, it's lengthy in all the wrong ways. First off, the author spends more time making jokes and using point-less examples to describe a concept. Then, the author proceeds to use not-even-pseudo-code to explain concepts. Then, lastly, the code is presented, but it is not documented properly which makes it harder to trace, especially if you're a beginning data structures student (which I am). The one thing that nags me about this book is the authors use of a stack-implementation in the hash tables (pushing the data to the back of the list) rather than a queue implementation (placing the data at the front of the list), which takes up less operations. Overall, this book is NOT a good thing to buy nor even own."
1,Course book,"Typically most students that take Data Structures are neither lazy nor stupid. This may be considered to be a good book if the person using it already knows the language and has good understanding of the principles used within the book. As a course book for people that are attempting to learn, this book has very little to offer. Sadly, I am in a class that requires this book. Everyone in the class is complaining about this book and even the teacher is having second thoughts about using it again. Probably the main problem is the cryptic code snippets included."
1,I'm speechless about this book...,"I've seen many worst books out there but this one seems to top it all. The author really makes simple thing complicated, I'm not sure why. I have a decent background in programming and I'm just trying to learn a bit more about Data strucctures and learn C++ at the same time (two birds with one stone, ya know)but this book really gives me an Ulcer.I'm reading this book b'cause I'm taking a class and unfortunately (you guess it) this is the required text book, but luckily I already finished post graduate schoolso I'm just taking this class to improve my programming skills so having lousy grade is not an issue.I can't wait to resell this lousy book. Does anyone know a better C++ Data structure book out there, besides this one of course?Thank You"
3,"decent kirby book, just wished the book's paper was of better quality...","Just got my copy of the kirby collector today....and i must say it's....well good i guess. If you love Kirby then there's lots of reading material here. Tons of Q&A; with colleaques etc. For me that's just the problem...i just wish there was more to look at..i mean..this guy is an illustrator/artist after all, and i bought the book to look at his work, not to read about it. Also the paper quality plain sucks as the pencilled art doesn't look good at all, poor paper=poor reproductions. The inked works look decent though.Don't get me wrong it's a decent book for the hardcore Kirby fan but i was looking for more of Kirby's workin this. i bought the wrong book.....i'll look elsewhere for a better retrospective on this great artist."
1,A Major Disappointment,"This book was a disappointment. There was virtually nothing in it I could use. It is so basic that it might be appropriate for grade school level, but that is about all. When I purchased it, I was hoping for some real pointers, tips and exercises I could use to improve my listening skills. What is contained in the book is generalities such as on page 17: three keys to hearing the message: care, pay attention and select what is important. Or on page 60, the book covers stopping bad listening habits by (a) catching yourself in the act, (b) fighting the habit, (c) substituting the old habit for a new habit, (d) ackowledge your success and (e) be patient with yourself. There are too many quizes and ""listening labs"". I do not recommend this book."
5,Very enjoyable,I was very suprise at the quality of the product.The sound was very good and I will be ordering from this company again.
2,"WHERE IS ""ONE DAY I'LL FLY AWAY""?","okay so how can you put together a best of randy crawford album WITHOUT ""one day ill fly away"", her greatest track?why do these record companies do this when they put together best of albums? they always, ALWAYS miss out a vital track, no matter who the artist is."
5,Let me peek through a hole in the tent at the circus inside,"Ms. Disher did an excellent job of conveying the life of a ""ploob"" (plebe with boobs) in an world of ""plicks."" I read the manuscript and couldn't put it down. My wife has just finished it and her emotions have been taken on a roller coaster ride."
4,A brilliant account of VIRTUE!,"This is a very beautiful and brilliant account in virtues. If you are a Christian, ya gotta strive to get it right. If your a Buddhist, the same is true. If your Jewish, live it! Whatever the Faith of any Individual, it must be reflected or attempted to be driven towards the reflection of their life experiences. Not too much to say about this book except that it needs to be read! It needs to have an impact on the lives that it comes in touch with. Otherwise, what's the point in pretending to be someone your not or don't care to be?"
3,"Tintin, Vol. 3","The Tintin stories are wonderful and timeless, but the reduced page size in this book is almost impossible to read."
2,glenn ford,"System very efficient. Book arrived well within the time period indicated and well before I expected it.Book in good codition etc and well packaged. However the content of the book was not what I expected, given Glenn Ford was a famous film star. I expected the content to be about his films. Instead it was about plants. It would have been helpful to have an indicator of the content of the book."
2,Yes--a fact checker,"I agree completely with other reviwers who bemoan the lack of fact-checking. There are portions of this book that are off enough, and potentially problematic enough, that it should not be used as a stand-alone resource."
4,One man's view of higher dimensions,"This volume takes you through Kaluza-Klein formalism and there is some math that must be understood for an insightful experience. Some of the material is dated, and Dr. Kaku's string theory has taken a beating in the scientific community of late.However, this book is still one of the best introductions to the fifth dimension and the integration of time, electromagnetism, and gravitation.There are books that are best described as mind candy; Dr. Kaku's works are a brain feast that will nourish your intellect and imagination for as long as your remain lucid."
2,Not a very good book,"I have read a number of books at this point on grand unification and theory of everything. This book in particular deals with superstrings as a means by which to unify the physical forces. From a personal standpoint I do not like superstring theory as the answer to grand cosmological problems. The readability is also poor and the writing is disjointed. Last, I prefer the works of Martin Rees and Kip Thorne to Kaku. Again this book is very disjointed and does not even present superstrings all that well. Spend your money elsewhere, on the afformentioned authors, or check out some Feynman books if it is unified force type of stuff."
3,Entertaining and informative,"If you are bored, this will be a fun read. I had no problem reading this book from the first half toward the middle, then it got extremely technical. I had to skip one chapter in the middle and proceed ahead to the rest of the book. Compared to other books on this topic, the content of this book is about average. The authors aimed more toward entertaining you rather than teaching you, which is fine. My favorite quote from this book: ""You don't understand mathematics, you just get used to them"", as said by John von Neumann."
5,Supernatural: Seaons 1-5,"This is a must for any fan of the supernatural itself. They take things to the weird and extreme. They push more bounderies than anyone even know exsisted. Dean, the hunter at heart and Sam the reluctant one, travel from place to place. Trying to make the world a safer place for all of us that live in it. Do be afraid of the monsters in the closet and under the bed. But always know that Dean and Sam will be there to take care of them and to keep you safe. The love/hate relationship (hate on Sam's part)between these two brothers is very touching and will make you cry. All the things that Dean has done for Sam to be able to go to school and Sam doesn't even realize it. Dean has been watching over and taking care of Sam since he was 4 and Sam was 6 months old. That is a lot of burden to place on a 4 year old boy, but Dean has lived up to that and when it comes down to the wire even is willing to die for Sam. Need to own so that you can watch over and over again."
4,5 in 1 digital camera,"My son loves the camera, the only thing I didn't realize that it takes AAA batteries. I know that there are some cameras similar to my sons that take AA. Other than that were good. Thank you."
1,WARNING: Do Not Buy! Terrible Video!,This camera/Mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true! I brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies. But I was sadly mistaken... This camera just takes cheap pictures and videos. The only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that I had no need for. After about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better I gave up and sold it on eBay for the same price as I brought it for. It's a great idea... but it just isn't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice. The Mp3 player isn't all that wonderful either. It doesn't work with iTunes. Or easy work with Windows. Hope this helps... I wish I would have read this before I brought this camera.
1,Bad picture quality,my parents bought me this camera for x-mas four years ago and since then it has been sitting in my closet collecting dust. There is a lot to this camera that is wrong.1. The picture quality is HORRIBLE! The pictures are too dark even with the flash on.2. Getting photos on the computer is a pain. My brother is a computer wizz and he could not get the photos onto the computer.3. The battery life is pathetic. You take three to four shots and your`e done you need to go buy more batteries.So save yourself the trouble and do NOT buy this camera unless you want another thing in your closet collecting dust.
2,And the Crowd Goes Wild/And the Fans Roared,"It's a good book & great for those who have CD players. BUT it would be great to also offer it on cassette (for those people, like my father, who do not have a CD player, but would LOVE it)."
5,Awesome,"Highly addictive...beautiful graphics and music...the story, quests and items are very true to RPG...It combines some of the best elements of the games that I recall playing in the past like Origins Ultima VII, Baldur's Gate and most recently Guild Wars...Highly recommended for those who recall and remember the D&D games from childhood....the only drawback is that there is not enough time in a day for play as much as I want...especially with family and my busy life"
2,It's sort of like single player WoW,"Think World of Warcraft... but all by yourself. Sure, the game is huge and there's tons of stuff to do - but will you want to do it? For me, it is a definite no. I hate reading long reviews so here's a breakdown.Pros:HugeOpen-ended (aside from the main plot)Easy to cheat (item duplication, weak AI)Cons:Zero socializationWAY over-hypedToo Complex /Laughable in game explanations (+1 Feather on Self... um, yay?)Awkward fighting (or maybe I just don't like first person sword fights?)All but pointless third person modeI bought this game on a whim when I first purchased the PS3, since it was raved about all over the net. Terrible choice. I played it all the time... until I bought my second game. I haven't even touched ES since then. If you are looking for a new game for you PS3, go and download Tekken, Stardust HD, or Calling all Cars (or all three, which is still cheaper than this game)."
5,Over-encumbered...I hate that.,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, seriously.I think other games like Prince of Persia, Sonic or Metal Gear are pointless now. This is the future and this is what will become of video games. It's worth your money. I hate spending my money in arcade-type-boring-games, I played those games when I was a kid with my Sega Geneis...now it's just stupid to do that...I have a PS3 and I want something more, and this is it!Games like Oblivion, GTA series or Fallout3 are the future. Games like Star Wars Force Unleashed, Ninja Gaiden, Prine of Persia....etc...are a waste of time and money. They are good games for a weekend, but not for spending 60 dollars for Christ's sake!Can't wait The Elder Scrolls V!!!!"
2,Boring and Buggy,"The game looks OK and it does have a lof of options, but the bugs drive me nuts and overall I find it kind of boring. I stopped playing after a week or so. My 9 year old son hates this game too.When I start the game up, I go to a sceen informing me not to turn off the system when it's writing to the hard drive, like every other game. For some reason, with this game I can get stuck on this screen for over a minute. I press X and nothing happens.I'm not a huge fan of role playing games. Every few years I buy a game with a good review and then after playing I remember why I don't like games like this. It's because you do a lot of moving around and not much else."
3,Oblinion 4... one of the few awesome games out there,"If you gave a PS3, and have played Motorstorm and Resistance a million times? You should get oblivion. It will drain all of your free time until the better games like Ninja Gaiden and GRAW 2 come out."
1,Dumb,"Although the DVD cover says this is about teenagers, and the 'kids' are shown in school, all the actors are obviously much older. None of them do a very good job of faking teenage behavior or even looking like teenagers. The British can make a sex comedy that is truly funny, but Americans seem to only make them seem dumb and silly. This movie is full of totally unbelievable silly behavior that makes the movie barely worth watching. I gave it a 'D' rating only because the language is surprisingly clean for a dumb sex comedy."
5,the best,"the best there is. but if you want the most for you money, and don't have 100 bucks for bearings, buy the bones super-6."
1,"weak, short life","This is a weak product. Doesn't pick up signals as well as others and mine died within a year from overheating.Don't bother purchasing, you will be wasting your money."
1,Ugliest pearl earrings...,"Very disappointed with these earrings, but you get what you pay for. They are large and flat and are just plain ugly."
5,Perfect for Holding Playbills...,"... and so much less expensive than the ""official"" Playbill binder. Especially useful if you're like me and you can already fill up three of these easily, and plan to fill more as time passes."
5,Space-age pimping all the way baby!!!!,Eightball and MJG have done it again!! There new album in our lifetime may be there one yet. With the awsome bass heavy beat and lyrics that cut to the bone it's gets may vote for album of the year.
2,This Is Sorry!,I can't beleive I bought this cd with high hopes. It is terrible and all these people giving it 5 stars. Yeah right this is sad. Eightball made a tight double cd and then they come out with this! What a waste of talent!
3,Okay for people not serious about yoga,"This DVD doesn't have a serious tone to it. It seems like the actress feels goofy doing yoga and that reflects on the mood of the DVD and there for on the person practicing. The way she looks doesn't inspire confidence in her yoga proficiency. It is a beginners, beginners level instructional yoga. I wouldn't buy this again. I wouldn't suggest it to a friend. Instead I would try a Rodney Yee dvd, if you were going for a more relaxed beginners yoga."
5,This DVD is my prize possession!,"I adore this DVD! I have quite a collection of yoga DVD's and Ashley Turner is definitely my favorite instructor! She has a calming voice and I enjoy the positive statements throughout the practice. I also love the outdoor background with the ocean view. I haven't become bored with any of her DVD's as I have with others. This DVD has two programs, each around 30 minutes long. The program for stress relief is hugely effective. I had a terrible tension headache and after using the stress relief program on this DVD, my headache was gone and I felt completely relaxed. I enjoy doing these programs in the morning to set a positive tone for my day. I highly recommend the element series of yoga dvds. Power Yoga from Element is fun and challenging and features Ashley Turner as the instructor as well."
3,Good,"This product ships extremely fast, I received it on the first possible estimated date! Which I was not expecting because there was such a long time frame it we estimated to arrive in (Dec.28th to Jan. 15th)! This is my first Ashley Turner DVD and to be honest, she's quite talkative. Also, I enjoy the yoga for flexibility far more than the yoga for stress relief (you can choose to do just one of them or both). I found the stress relief session to be flat out boring but, I like to stretch a lot more in my yoga so it's just a personal thing. If your like me and like your yoga to be lots of stretching I would reccomend just buying a flexibility DVD! But, if you like both or are a beginner and don't know which you prefer yet this is a good DVD."
2,A Lot of Meditation... Some Stretching,"Here's my caveat: I don't do yoga to meditate. I do yoga for exercise. This DVD has too much of the meditation part of yoga for me- and the ""ask a blessing"" stuff. That's just not for me.*IF* you practice that kind of yoga, I'm sure this DVD is fine. But it's not my cup of tea, and I won't be using this again."
2,Disappointment and more than a bit dull,"When I was awake and reading this book, I thought it a silly misuse of trees and ink. The author produced a book that is actually more dull than the sum of all policy reports in D.C., where she works. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets high marks from those who haven't actually read it. The book offers no recommendations on how to improve ecotourism or guarantee its success as a tool for sustainable development."
2,Odd Reoccuring Noise,"I purchased this printer in April (2005) and soon noticed that it made a loud noise that lasted a few seconds, every few hours. The Tech Support team kept saying it was a faulty clutch and would sent me a new refurished) printer within a few days. They did send another printer but within minutes the noise began again and did so with the next FOUR printers they sent me. After a time I found it was the top paper roller moving every two hours (to the minute) even when the printer had never been connected to a computer! I have spent hours on the phone trying to resolve the issue and a lot of time repacking and mailing back the old printers. I thought I was getting a good deal but I guess not. I guess have to learn to live with the noise or just unplug it.Update- To be fair, this printer is still working well a full two years later (I don't print a lot) without me having to replace anything. I connected it to a power strip so I can flick a switch to shut it off (and avoid the noise.)"
1,Male fantasy,"If you are a male over 50 and lust after your daughter's friends, you'll surely find this a vicarious hoot. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Waste of time,"What a bad piece of literature. Several times I stopped reading this book, but then picked it up in the hopes that just maybe there will be some interesting development in the next chapter. However, that's not the case- it stays flat and boring the whole time. Let me summarize the plot so you don't have to waste your time: cynical man in mid-life crisis presents his views on life and sex. He comes across a new age group (based on the Raelians) and through inaction helps their founders. Every other chapter is a brief unemotional journal entry several centuries later briefly describing a dystopian Earth. That's it."
1,who needs this?,"Another novel about the futility of all relationships. What an anguish to read about the endless clones of the main character, clones all hoping to achieve the ""supreme goal"" i.e. a total annihilation of anger, fear, affection, sex, longing... ?? Houellebecq focuses mainly on depicting an ice-cold SF-like universe where people interact on a terminal of a computer, with even the thought of a webcam forbidden!! That's all that's left to life.I paid Euros8 to buy this book.I spent one week to get through 3/4 of this book.Tell you what, i knew before opening this book that life is not a rose bed, that human relationships are rotten, that what we all fear - loss of love at its utmos- might really happen ... so i consider the money and the time i spent on it LOST.The view is not a pleasant one, so if you're not depressed get some pills while reading it, if you are depressed look for another book."
1,Yuck.,"I did not enjoy this book at all! It was VERY slow moving and full of rather obscure references which did little to add to my enjoyment in the text. And while I'm sure it's no fault of the translator, it just didn't strike me as being all that well-written. It was boring and had a rather lame ""futuristic"" plot that didn't make too much sense, or seem properly executed. I really wouldn't read anything else by him or recommend this to anyone."
5,Versatile Binoculars,"I have used these binoculars in the Amazon jungle, the Galapagos Islands, at a political rally, and several Spurs games. I find them perfect for me because they are a compromise of size and magnification. I don't like to carry heavy binoculars and usually opt to leave them behind. These are light enough to be taken along and powerful enough to be beneficial in the diverse situations I listed above."
1,Awful junk,I gave one star because you can't give zero these are horrible binoculars my 25 dollar buschnells are waaaay superior when I called Nikon they told me I shouldn't have bought them from amazon great customer service don't you think.? Thi things have double images the instructions don't cover diopter adjustments and the folks at Nikon said they don't even make them anymore
5,A Must Have for Pipe Organ Enthusiasts,I was lucky enough to have seen part of this on television a few years ago. Now I would like to find a copy. Such an honor to watch one of the greatest organist/composers of the 20th century work up close and personal! There are clips of this available on YouTube.
4,REMOVE THE WIRE!,"We had this toy for 3 months until the wire broke. Once you remove the wire, it works as a remote control toy - the way it's supposed to. You have to remove the wire completely from Scoop AND Bob the Builder - which is just disconnecting the plugs. Easy to use and fun for my 2 year old."
1,Doesn't Work...Don't waste your money~~~~~~~~,"My son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday. He was so excited when we got it open and he couldn't wait to play with it. After 60 frustraiting minutes, my son and my husband gave up on trying to make it work. The scoop character does NOT follow the Bob remote. Scoop gets lost in follow me mode and says,""What's going on Bob?"" Literally! Now it just sits and collects dust.Don't waste your time or money. You'll find most Bob the Builder toys are not well made and we've been dissapointed by them every time. We no longer purchase any Bob the Builder toys. :o("
2,Skip this Steel Magnolia...,"This story sounds like it will be fun, but it becomes a Venus/Mars tirade that has a bitter twinge to it at times. The main character fails to grasp our empathy, respect, or even sympathy, and the plot doesn't always make coherent strides forward. Skip this unless you too have a lot of unresolved anger toward men."
1,Stupid book filled with cliches,"This book started out good for the first couple of chapters. It started to go down hill and by the time I realized how bad it was, I was more than half way done. I finished only because so I could discuss it with other people I know who have read it. In my opinion, the author seemed to be making up the story as she went along. Character developement was erratic (bringing in tattoos on a character that earlier was a matron type.) Plot was undistinguished. No real story line except man bashing. Certain characters dropped and then brought back in for no apparent reason except to end the story somehow. What a waste of paper!"
4,Don't need to be a southern belle to enjoy this one!,"You don't need to take a rose apart to know why it is beautiful, you don't need to dissect Queen Bee to know why it warms the soul. Just make yourself comfortable and let this cast of really likeable characters take you on their journey. Ms Smith reminds us life is too short to be taken too seriously. Isn't there a little Lin and Uncle Bedford in all of us? I hope so. Loved the book."
2,Trying to be too cute,Found this novel very trite and the lead character too overblown and shrill. Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay??? I am sure that he is NOT. Loaded with errors and mis-spellings. I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family. Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all. This novel could have been alot better and I am not going to read any of her other books. Too many good southern writers to read instead of reading Ms. Smith's. Read Cathy Holton's novel instead - wonderful southern women's novel.
4,A comprehensive view of a US Navy Fighter Squdron in WW2,"A must for anyone who is interested Military Aviation. Tom Blacburn's novel, The Jolly Rogers, oulines the genisis of one of the most well known US Naval Fighter Squdrons in existance - with the Skull and Cross Bones still flying today on the F-14B's of VF-103. In two combat tours, the Jolly Rogers not only broke the backbone of Japanese resistance about the Soloman Islands - destroying 154 Japanese aircraft, but also vindicated their belief in the fighting ability of the F4U, having earlier refused to give up their beloved Corsairs for F6F Hellcats. Vividly written, it allows the reader to glimpse what life on the frontline must have been like, through Tom Blackburn's own experiences and feelings. Sometimes funny, always frank and moving, this novel is a must for anyone wanting a comprehensive library on Military Aviation - or with an interest in the Jolly Rogers"
5,Great Book,I purchased this book for my son as I was already familiar with it through a daycare I worked at. The author's words press on like a train with the rhythm and the rhyme. My son loves this book (as he loves trains also!)
5,A must-have for your library,This book has captured the attention of all 3 of my boys. I bought it when my 6 year-old (my oldest) was little and it has since become one of our favorites. The illustrations are wonderful and captivating for the younger children and yet provide older children with creative ways to use their imaginations. Each of my boys have articulated that they thought the engineer was Daddy and they were the little boy accompanying him. It didn't matter the skin color. They were able to identify with the characters in the book. This book is definitely one of our favorites and has been taped up to ensure it continues to have a long life. The ending provides a nice soft way to transition to saying good night.
4,"Great book, but the pages are too thin","My son(2 1/2)and I both love this book. It's beautiful and fun to read. However, my only complaint is that he has a hard time ""reading"" it himself because the pages are so thin. It makes it too difficult for him to turn the page without missing a lot of pages, and even though he's very gentle, he ends up bending or creasing the pages. It wouldn't likely be a problem if the book itself wasn't so big. But large, thin pages aren't easy for a child to do himself."
3,Just Okay,"Honestly, after reading the reviews I was expecting so much more from this book. It doesn't hold up to titles such as ""Goodnight Moon,"" ""Run Away bunny,"" Guess How Much I Love YOU,"" etc. The rhymes in this book are incredibly infantile. The book does redeem itself somewhat on the last two pages. The only reason that my toddler likes this book is because it's about a choo-choo train, and he happens to be going through a train phase."
4,A must for storytime!,My 2 y/o son is into trains and loves this book. We read it to him at bedtime and it helps him wind down (especially because the train goes to sleep at the end).
4,Good but not great.,"The movie is a good effort and does help to understand how some of the concepts of the novel might be envisioned, but is not a satisfying realization of all the events and action of the novel. Probably no movie could do that in two hours. That would probably need a long TV series, such as COSMOS."
1,Lame,"Gee, what can I say... this is a very lame lower level intelligence movie. Wish I had not spent any money on it."
2,Meh....,"I bought this movie for Demons In My Head. I saw it for rent back in the 90s, now in 2013 I decided to finally buy it and watch it, and it was cheaper buying it in this combo. All the reviews are going on and on about To Become One, which was less than terrible. Same story with Demons In My Head. I love B movies, and I knew what I was going into with buying this because I have watched most of Brain Damage Films (most of which are awful). Don't bother with either of these, they are both slow, boring, and crappy. The only Brain Damage Film worth watching is Terror Toons."
2,Disappointing Flag Book,"Although this book showed some flags I was unfamiliar with, it came up short in terms of small pennants, which was my main reason for ordering it. In addition, there were very few color pages at all, and none of actual flags showing the detail most Collectors are looking for. Save your money.Jim Washington state"
5,Great Gear Bag,"This is a great size bag for the beach or other times you may want to bring gear that needs to dry quick, it is a very well made bag. Its slightly larger than I expected but perfect size for what I needed"
2,Too big for a small person,"I am 5'4"" and this bag was away too big for me. It's about 1 1/2 x 2 1/2 before pull the strings on top. The straps are too rough on the bare skin when I wear a sleeveless shirt. If you like a big bag and wear a jacket all the time, you may like it. Sewn well and durable fabric. The silver color looks quite the same as the picture on line."
3,What a shame!!!!!,Got my Mesh torn. Since I live in Costa Rica it was a lot more expensive to send it back than to buy a new one here. Waste of money on this one!!!!
2,She coped L.J.Smith,"Anyone who's read L.J.Smith's novel The Chosen (published 1997) can see that Atwater Rhodes as blantantly copied it. In the Chosen, Raschel seeks revengence after her mother is killed by vampires. She learns how to fight and became, surprise, a vampire hunter. She helps Daphane Childs out and discovers a secret world of human slave trade run by vampires and shapeshifts. So Raschel goes undercover as a slave to bring down the organization and ends up falling in love with one of the vampires running it.Now where have I heard this story from?"
5,can't everyone just get off her back?,"Atwater-Rhodes is a great author, and this book is no different.For all of those who say that they're ""Tired"" of the ""same"" plotlines, i say get a clue. Are any of *you* writing and being published, much less at such a young age? Are any of *you* actually selling copies of your books (if you've written any)? it seems to me that some people are just peeved and jealous.as for those who prefer to read and ridicule, try writing something productive. you dont have to read her books. and some people like the whole girl falls for guy vamp-storyline (not that that's all she's done). its HER choice what to write about, and if she keeps writing as well as she does then i am not going to ridicule her until her writing goes down the toilet.as a teen writer, i have tons of respect for Ms. Atwater-Rhodes.she's good. get over it."
2,Incompleto,"Resumen de la etapa con discos Borinquen para la que Lissette grabo aproximadamente una veintena de discos. Se dejan fuera muchos grandes exitos y se incluyen algunas canciones que ni siquiera se escucharon. Dada la dificultad de encontrar las grabaciones originales de esa epoca se pueden rescatar algunos temas importantes. En resumen,una compilacion mediocre que no reune realmente lo mejor de Lissette."
4,Great stuff,"3 movies showing 3 great fights: with Liston, Foreman and Frazier (in Manila). Superb commentary. Pretty good."
3,"These are the whole fights, not a highlight reel...","It's important to keep in mind that these videos are the whole fights (Liston, Foreman, and Frazier III), not an assemblage of the most thrilling moments replete with docu-sport commentary. I was a little disappointed, b/c I expected something different -- but, admittedly, that's mostly my fault."
4,He Shocked The World,"These videos show all three phases of Ali's amazing career: he beats Liston with speed, Frazier with power, and Foreman with brains.This is a great set of videos, but I sure wish I could find the first two Ali-Frazier fights in a similar package."
4,Robart Manf. Paint Shaker,"It does a good job, but the box would bounce around all over the table. I put some double sided velcro on the bottom and stuck it to the table. Now it stays still and doesn't make hardly any noise."
2,Paint Shaker,"This item stopped working in 6 months. Thought it was a little pricey for the use I received from it. It was a great ideal for people that have joint issues, but needs to go back to the drawing board! I know 5 other people that had the same problem."
4,The Shaker shakes,"CND Shellac Color Coat with UV3 Technology, Base CoatI bought the shaker for Shellac nail polish because reviews said how important it is to get the most out of the polish - and the polish is pricey. The shaker works well and saves my wrists however it is not a heavy-duty machine. If I want to turn it on and walk away to prep for polishing I always wedge it against something to prevent it from shaking itself onto the floor. An invention of suction cup feet would be great. It does the job - I bought the extra little straps because it only came with one although you could probably rig an elastic with knots to work."
5,powerful,The book was powerful and helpful to my individual needs. The service was fantastic as well. I am sharing the book with friends.
2,Not as good as his previous 2 books,"I am a fan of Ron Rash's fiction too. I did not think that this book was as good as the first two. The characters were not as compelling, the language not as lyrical, and the plot not as exciting. There were too many loose ends--Travis's future college plans, reconcilation with his family, etc. The whole book moved slowly."
5,To continue or not to continue... that is the question?,"I read the book and I thought it was amazing... I don't want to give away what happens but it is seriously NOTHING YOU ARE GOING to expect. I know I started to cry at the end... it's very touching and emotional. I think that people are going to be sad and angry but it's actually a great new begining. I was wondering though... usually in the fron of the book they say the title of the next book. This was such a surprize ending, and there was no new title to be announced! Does this mean Bonnie's not going to continue her wonderful teen series?"
2,"A ""sequel""???","In light of the title, I was expecting more of a real sequel to the first one. I don't know anything about the video games so I can only comment on the movie. Dolph Lundgren seems to be getting very tired from his other movies action requirements. The plot was sorta lame, the ""special effects"" minimal, the acting pretty much had a low bar requirement and the concept of the overall ""plot"" made me wonder why the film was even made! I mean really... if someone needs a place to spend money (wisely)... I could mention a few worthy causes where LOTS of people would benefit in a positive way rather than a handful wasting the time it took to watch this film!"
1,In The Name of the King two worlds,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever saw. As a matter of fact after about twenty minutes or soon I just got up and turned off the movie and went to do my laundry or to find some dirty dishes to wash. I told myself the next time I just stroll in family video to rent a movie I will DO SOME RESEARCH FIRST before I rent anything. This movie is horrible, unknown actors and poor everything. Don't bother renting it Don't buy it leave it on the shelf and hope that no one wastes any time renting it. There is nothing about it that either me or my husband found interesting ... a waste of time...I gave it one star but it didn't deserve that."
2,desepcionada,Desepcionada pues de haber visto el tamaño real del producto no lo hubiera adquirido por el precio que pague.
5,Very cute!,"I bought this for my neice (because her father and grandparents own a family construction business) and it is very cute! The pieces are all soft, so she won't her herself (or anyone else) with it. It's nice that it has the words on it, but I think that by the time she can read, she will have outgrown this."
1,More Like Zero Stars,"Where's the ""0"" star rating when you really need it?Bad acting, aimless direction, impossible to decipher soundtrack (thankfully we get subtitles for the dialogue), and worst of all, a premise that might--might--have worked in 1975, but hardly 2005. In short, the story concerns Why It's Okay to Be Gay. Duh. Throw in some absurdly unbelieveable bit characters in the fashion of a sitcom's B-story line and there you are: A Total Waste of Time. I've had more fun watching rocks erode.Avoid."
4,Lighthouse Guide,"great little book to have with me on my ""Lighthouse Quest"", wouldn't go lighthouse hunting without it"
2,Anecdotal but not Informative,"Kirstie tells us about a few months in her life, but nothing about how she lost weight, lost her ars, or regained her life.For entertainment value, it's great. For information, it misses completely.Kirstie is an excellent commedienne, but she should have stuck to acting - writing is surely not her forte."
4,good reading if you like Kirstie,"Cute, just as Kirstie. There is no diet information in this book. Just Kirstie accepting her size. It was good and I enjoyed it. I think acceptance is what this book is about."
5,A hilarious hunka love,"Kirstie Alley's journey through public life has been joyous, celebratory and sometimes rough. Anyone who has opened a series of tabloids to see her own expanding butt featured as the centerfold deserves an air kiss, a hot fudge sundae and an AK-47 loaded for bear.Alley also deserves respect, however, for her work (very, very funny), her honesty and her willingness to plop her expanded arse down on the sofa next to you and tell it like it is. Yowza! What a relief! What a hoot! Wotta broad!"
5,There's a powerful Goddess in us all!,"The Goddess of Happiness is a wonderful book chalk full of inspirational ideas you can use to realize your potential. From my view, many of the women I know spend the majority of their time focused on their families leaving little time in the equation for themselves. And I'm just the same. The Goddess of Happiness has been a catalyst for me--showing me that making small changes amount to big differences. And these new perceptions and actions really make me feel like a powerful goddess. Thanks to Debbie Gisonni for this eye-opening book that puts life in perspective!"
5,It is no accident...,"...that Tommy walks this planet and does what he does. At the time of the Center Stage show, I was sitting in my Vacaville apt. channel surfing and just by accident (?) happened upon this sweet man and his sweet music. I had never heard nor seen the likes of TE before. As it was, I went to his website and discovered that he was due to play in Petaluma at the Mystic in a month.Outside the theater, in the line waiting to get in, we all buzzed with our personal ""how I discovered him"" stories and impressions. I got there early and was able to snag a seat down front. Next to sitting in the back room at the Elbow Room in Harrisonburg Va. to listen to Happy The Man on a Sunday afternnon, this is my favorite show."
1,Wrong Item,The company sent me the wrong product. When I called them to set up the replacement item they said they would be sending the correct product and an email regarding the transaction. I have received neither. I have tried to contact them numerous times for right product but still nothing. Unprofessional.
1,Terrible Blender!!,"I immediately liked the color and style of this blender until I turned it on, so terribly loud it is offensive. Not only that, and I have read reviews after my purchase, the plastic jar has tiny little cracks on it and is leaking after 2 months of use. I only use the blender once per days and may include some frozen fruit in the smoothie. I understand that this is a design flaw so am trying to contact the manufacturer for either a replacement jar (most likely will crack again) or a different glass blender. Buyer beware on this one!!!"
5,"excellent, gripping production","I love Wagner and the Ring and I'm aware of its faults, at times clunky dramaturgy and repetitive content. This production has solved all this and I was glued to my seat for 2 nights taking hardly a break between acts and music dramas. Siegfried was particularly great -- the one night I tend to like the least. In this production at last it was both dramatically and emotionally convincing.The musical performance is solid but at times I wished some of the singers were of higher caliber.Overall, I couldn't recommend it more strongly. A fantastic theatrical experience, and at time funny, too!!!"
4,An entertaining read,"Although the plot of Probability Moon had elements in it that have been done before in science fiction, they were brought together in a way that I found to be fresh and engaging through the different points of view of the various characters --- including the alien characters. Kress' writing style is clear and her prose does not get in the way of the story and the characters, though not all totally three dimensional, were, for the most part, fleshed out nicely. I especially enjoyed the character of Enli, the Worlder who has to spy on the humans in order to atone for her crime and become ""real"" again so she can again truly be an insider in her culture. I also liked the fact that the plot was driven by a combination of physics and anthropology, a usually uneasy marriage of disciplines. Many previous reviewers obviously did not care for the book, but I liked it and will read more of her work, including the sequel Probability Sun. So there."
2,Fairly bad,"The book's beginning is amazing but as you read further you'll be dull about the book. The last 100 pages or so are so long-winded that you'll think of leaving the book, and you know what? You can leave it there because the end has so many loopholes and loose ends that you'll be disappointed. On the other hand what has to do Eve Duncan and her kin in the plot?"
1,Wretched!!,"This was quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. I couldn't even finish it! The plot was ridiculous, the dialogue atrocious, and the writing just plain terrible. I've never read a book where the writer used the words ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" so much in a person's thoughts. It was literally once every page and it got really old. I'm also pretty sure that normal guys don't just blurt out ridiculous lines like ""Am I going to get lucky?"" no matter how inexperienced they are in relationships.I've been trying to find some new authors lately because I've read all of the books by my favorite ones, but Iris Johansen will not be one of them. This is my first and last by her. Honestly, after reading this book I can't even fathom why she's a best selling author at all. Don't waste your time!!"
1,Like a bad soap opera...,"I bought this book based on the author's reputation. It was a mistake. I hated reading the book. The plot is not intense, and the dialogs in the book are too soap-opera like: just plain dumb and plenty bad.I found the main character of the book too whiny. I think the author meant for the main character to be a strong, determined lady with a mother's soft heart. However, it did not come through that way for me. I find the main character to be annoying. Many times I just wanted to slap her face and say ""just shut up about your kid already. He's fine.""I forced myself to finish the whole book. It was a mistake. I should have just tossed the book in the trash can.If you want to read a thriller, I don't recommend this one."
2,Disappointing,"I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them. I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book. What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd? Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know."
5,book,"I ordered this book after reading the book b-4 this one. I wanted to read it right after I was finished with the first book and it came very quickly. I was able to follow the story line into this book, with out waiting for ever for it.Thanks"
3,Readable But Not Her Best Work,"An interesting book but not Johansen's best work. I listened to the audio version and it was decent. The plot centers around a formula for REM 4 a mind control substance but the science is not explained quite enough to understand how it works or to really make it believable.Sophie, the main character is a bit of a poor me type person but she gets stronger throughout.Jane Maguire has a small role and some others characters from Johansens earlier books."
5,Killer Dreams,Iris Johansen has kept me reading way into the night again. I always like her characters and plots and I never figure it out until the end.
1,No-no-no,"The Eve Duncan books are not worth buying - if you must, borrow at the library - I didn't even open this book - just put it in a bag and left it at the library"
1,Great Idea! What happened?,"I found the premise of the story intriguing -- protecting plants for future generations. The history and the science appeared to be well researched, the characters had some substance and could certainly grow into rich personalities. I kept waiting for something to happen - interaction between the worlds, a spectacular find that could change history, a breach that required an operative from the company, a murder, something. I'm sorry to say I found it very boring."
2,Good Premise/Un-engaging story-telling,"While the premise of this novel sounds like an interesting new take on the time travel, I put it down after about a 100 hundred pages. I found the writing and story-telling to be a bit run-of-the mill, and there didn't seem to be a lot of suspense or sense of curiosity sparked. The premise of the series sounds interesting enough that in a way I wish I get through it and see if it gets better, but I guess when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy I feel if a writer can't get the reader interested early on, I don't have a lot of faith that I'll care a lot about the middle or ending.This may be a sci-fi/time travel disguised as a commentary of historic events, which is fine, but in my mind in the tradition of great fiction you can have underlying commentary, as well as great story. I would also barely classify this book as sci-fi (though that is how the publisher has labeled it)."
3,Light-weight Entertainment,"Undoubtly this book will spawn a whole series of books dealing with immortal time travlers, hardly the makings of grand fiction. No matter, the sci-fi elements are mere window dressing for the central story of a young girl's first love in early 16th century England. And thank goodness those elements are there because all of the giggles help disguise a bare bones, cliche-ridden love story. Now don't get me wrong - it is a fun read - but the hardly original observations that mankind is doomed to ever repeat his mistakes throughout history do not lift this book above the level of pulp fiction. As seems to be the norm these days - vastly overrated."
5,"This is rare stuff - historical, funny, romantic SF.","I read this in hardcover last spring, and I read it again when it came out in paperback with the nifty cover. It's a gem: science fiction that manages to be both romantic and funny when appropriate, without being a farce. The history is incredibly detailed and accurate, and for once an author seems to be observing the old maxim of those who do not study history being doomed to repeat it: she illustrates and points up her future with the details of the past, and her cyborg heroine's horrified comparison of one with the other. The original hardcover promised a sequal and, marvellously, it appears next month. Checking out the author's website will yeild an excerpt from the new one, and it looks to be as grand as the first. I can hardly wait - Ms. Baker's work is moving, well-crafted, thoughtful and actually entertaining. Hoorah!"
2,Overrated,"After reading some of the great reviews on this site, I was fairly disappointed with ""In the Garden of Iden.""All of the ""science fiction"" takes place in the first 10 pages of the book as the author describes The Company and the technology they developed to enable time travel. This chapter was well done and presented an intersting take on time travel.Once the main character makes it back in time, the story unravels like a 16th century Harlequin Romance. I'm surprised they didn't cast Fabio as Nicholas Harpole (the Cyborg's love interest)on the cover of this disappointing novel."
5,"Great book for adults, too!","I love science fiction, and read this after reading reviews. It was positively enjoyable! It was funny and interesting, and I never got bored or distracted. I know it's a children's book, but it was so refreshing to read! I'll always be happy to recommend it to anyone!"
2,"Great optical quality, but weak mechanically","These little Nikon Premier 8x20 LX glasses are very good quality optically, sharp from corner to corner and easy to focus. But mine have proven to be delicate and the hinges have loosened and become floppy twice in two years. Nikon USA fixed them under warranty, but I am not impressed with the lack of robustness. Not recommended."
2,Buy it used!,"There is a reason you can purchase this book here for around ... For that price you can't go wrong but if you pay more than that you will have wasted your money. If you are new at web design and need a basic understanding of css xml and xhtml it provides that but you could have found that one the web for free.When I purchase Magic Books I want projects that after I complete I can use. I didn't find them here. This is basic, basic, basic and it doesn't come with a cd."
4,blaupunkt speaker set,"These speakers sound great. They are advertised as a component set, but they do not have the crossover to make it a complete component set. Other than that they are really great speakers."
2,Predictable,"Not as bad as some folks are making it out to be. I was afraid it would be full of splattering blood and gore, and surprisingly it is not. But it is very predictable. The viewer knows what's coming long before the movie gets to its point."
1,Breaks easily in the hands of 3-year-olds,"The subject says it all. The body may be die cast metal, but the wheels are and are attached with cheap plastic. My little nephew made short work of it. For whom do these toy makers think they're making these toys? stepheda"
3,A little disappointed,"It is a very cute doll my two year old hasn't really taken to yet but I think he will eventually and he does keep him in his crib. I purchased it in June 2007 and gave it to my son as a Birthday gift in August. The flashlight died in about a month's time, give or take. There is no obvious or visible way to replace batteries?? I am also a little worried about the stiching behind Bob's neck as it is not very tightly stiched. I just contacted Ty's Toy Box and am hoping for a response regarding the flashlight..."
4,"Clear, concise, to the point","I really like this little book! The layout is great (no clutter) and easy to read. The font is adequate, the equations clear and the tone relaxed. While it isn't as in depth as most other books on this subject, it makes for a handy reference. It is a broad overview of the fundamentals of earthquake seismology. I find that it explains some of the more rigorous subject matter in an easier to understand way. If you're not understanding a subject very well in say, the book: ""Quantitative Seismology"", just refer to this little gem and wala...it's like a lightbulb coming on. I particularly like the section on source theory. It's like a breath of fresh air. I can't say enough about how accessible this book is. I recommend it highly."
1,Cute little lab puppy,"Guess I'm the only one, reviewing this so far, LOL!!! I could only rate, Nugget with all one stars, because I don't have him yet. But, I know he'll, be just as good as the 28 inch, Garth lab dog I just got today. But, I am going to pair them up, and make them a family. Cut idea eh? :-D"
3,a broad introduction,"I was surprised at how much material this book covered, especially with some of the colloquial forms of speech that wouldnt be taught in other, more ""formal"" courses...But it is very confusing sometimes and you will seriously have to put a LOT of work into memorizing the information presented in the dialogs. Yes, it's true that sometimes the book doesnt match the audio, but only with one or two words. The charts are extremely confusing and unhelpful...This book is not for the casual tourist, it is for a language learner who is intent on packing in as much information as possible with limited practice material.... so be warned i guess..."
4,Inside Story of the Industiral Revolution,"Lunar Men, an inside documentary on the dynamics between the engineers of the Industrial Revolution, chronicles the people, places, and ideas that staged the platform for the eventual publication of The Origin of Species in 1859. Since this extensively referenced book reads like a sophisticated encyclopedia, the reading is somewhat challenging.Richard William NelsonDarwin, Then and Now: The Most Amazing Story in the History of Science"
1,Complete waste of the purchase price,"I was truely dissapointed in this particular Duke Nukem title. Maybe had I not purchased 'Time to Kill' a year prior, my opinion on 'Meltdown', would have been different. Meltdown is nowhere in the same catagory as 'Time to kill'. The graphics to begin with are mediocre and better suited a less powerful system, i.e. the genesis or n64. Second the controls are cumbersome and hard to operate. There is no cycling of the weopons that made time to kill much more enjoyable. My suggestions to any fans of the Duke Nukem titles to completely pass this one up and if possible borrow a friends copy of 'meltdown' so you can return it after the dissapointment."
2,"Inexpensive, but flawed","Although a great bargain, the emulsion on these DVD-RW disks have uneven concentric markings, and a few had vertical flaws missing emulsion, rendering a 40% usefulness. I use 4 different DVD drives, so this isn't a burner problem. I could understand a faster write-speed product (requiring a higher laser output) to have rewrite problems, but for these 4x speed disks, I would recommend another brand (RiDATA disks have held up to 40+ rewrites successfully over several years)"
5,No lost data!,Was a bit worried as the price was really low at 8.95 per 25 but have had no lost data and have used 50 of the 75 discs purchased. Very satisfied as well with the prompt shipping. Easy 5 stars in my book.
5,look no further,"this is the best dvd+rw 4x I have ever bought. I tried another ""big"" brand and got scratched discs with the holder in middle broken on many of them. with amazon, you get your guarantee, and always a great product. I am on my second spindle of memorex and not a scratch in sight. try it, you'll like it!"
5,Video Recording,"Purchased these to use for transferring VHS to DVD using Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 and they have performed flawlessly. Have had no problems with formatting, etc. I would buy them again in a heartbeat. They aren't the cheapest, but they aren't the most expensive, either. Good value for a decent price."
5,"Funny, Smart, Compulsively Readable","This is a terrific read. Lerner has such a light touch, and such a delightfully wicked sense of humor, that anyone will empathize with her story: she's not just a fat girl looking for love and attention, but an extremely intelligent and self-aware person struggling with questions of meaning and worth. Her shocking swings up and down the scale are, for Lerner, swings between life and death, and between meaning and meaninglessness, hope and hopelessness. This memoir is one of the best I've read.I can think of about five people I want to buy this book for -- it would make a wonderful gift for anyone who's struggled with weight, depression, or any kind of existential angst."
4,funny and insightful,"Lerner opens the book with an amazing evocative description of getting weighed in gym class. She so well conveys the sense of shame a young girl would feel in that situation, that it is a bit disappointing that tone is not sustained throughout the entire book. However, it is not hard to find yourself mirrored in the book, at least if you are a white American woman like me. I have never been overweight, but I could totally relate to Lerner's struggle to reach what this culture perceives as a presentable weight. I cheered when Lerner finally took control of her life (helped by having a mood disorder properly diagnosed and treated) and stood up to an insensitive writing lecturer. Although the book is short on solutions for a reader hoping to conquer her own food demons, it is still a funny and fascinating, if painful, read."
5,Incredible!,"As a mother of three teen-age daughters and someone who has had no experience with eating disorders, this incredible tale of a bulimic mother was a true eye-opener. I encouraged my daughters to read it and after doing so, we were able to have some healthy, honest discussions regarding eating and body-image issues. Ms. Krikorian's raw, honest account of her struggle with bulimia is an inspiring story. I wish her the strength she needs to control this disorder and the hope for a possible recovery."
2,Disappointing,"After enjoying the Blair Witch Chronicles comics, the Blair Witch Project Dossier, and the Secret Confession of Rustin Parr (not to mention the original movie), I thought I would get the same buzz from this book. Sadly, I found the writing to be a lot less compelling than those other tie-ins. The description was flat, the characters were simple and dull, and the plot was fairly predictable. Worst of all, it just wasn't very scary. Despite an attempt at a ""did it happen or didn't it?"" twist, I saw the ending coming about a hundred pages away. I'm afraid I won't be making reading further volumes in this series a priority."
5,Thai Cuisine,This is the fourth copy of this book I have purchased. People always want to keep a copy as I usually travel with it or prepare the recipes from memory. All recipes well received.First tasted at Mekong restaurant in Honolulu and enjoyed the meal. Challenge is to reproduce the flavours of the restaurant from the cookbook. Well written and simple to follow.
1,Keo's cookbook,"is more about Brand (Keo's) commercialization, placement and reinforcement than cooking.I found the recipe's un-authentic, over-prepared and stunningly presented in pictures. None of this was useful in building my skill in the cooking of authentic Thai dishes.Worse, I still envy the beautiful dish presentations that are beyond my resources to plate to the family table."
5,Best book for self-study,Learning general relativity has always been a dream of mine. This book made it possible for me to learn GR on my own. A dream come true!
3,"First Impressions: Rather Brief, but Useful","This book has a lot of very good core material (it contains exactly what it says on the cover). I intend to extract all useful information from this book over the next few months. I have read it cover to cover and listened to the CD. To have all this information organised into one small book is an extremely useful resource.My one and only reservation is that the text is overly brief and suffers from the ""too obvious to mention"" syndrome. I concede that the book is aimed at approximately intermediate players (I am....I think); but wow - some of this stuff really needs an explanation for people lacking a solid music education (me, and others). Just a couple of extra short paragraphs here and there, or a good reference. It would enhance the usefulness of the book many times, and really make the Exercises/solos shine. In addition the annotation of the Standard pieces with information a couple of page turns away is a bit frustrating."
4,This audio cassette series is very enlightening,This audio cassette series is extremely enlightening and you do not have to be single for this to pertain to you. It points out things that you recognize in yourself and offers ways to help improve the way you communicate and listen and help your partner feel more important and loved. I highly recommend this title.
2,Poorly Written,"I found that the book has quite a bit of typos, mispellings, and at times contradictory information. This was espeically frustrating and confusing, since preparing for a test that draws on such a wide pool of information is trying enough. I used Barron's which I thought was alright, but I have to attribute my passing the CLEP to the CLEP Comprehensive Success System, [...]. The problems on the CLEP were very similar to the problems in the three practice tests in the end of this other study guide I bought.If you want to waste your hard earned money and precious time on a poorly written study guide, this CLEP Official Study Guide 18th Edition is the book for you. Some of the grammatical errors in this book are so outrageous, and overall, the book is just a jumbled compilation of historical facts, with no specific ""plan of attack"" to help you pass the CLEP."
1,WASTE OF MONEY....,"TOOK THE TEST AND FAILED BY TWO POINTS.... NONE OF THE MATERIAL IN THE BOOK HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL TEST. IN ORDER TO PASS THE SOCIAL SCIENCE/HISTORY TEST, YOU NEED GENERAL KNOWLEGE OF US HISTORY, AND SOME SOCIOLOGY. BIG WASTE OF MONEY! INSTEAD, GO TO YOUR LOCAL BOOK STORE AND FLIP THROUGH THE BOOK TO GET THE GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEST. OTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE ON YOU OWN FOR THIS TEST."
1,Don't waste your rental money.................................,"because I couldn't wait for it to be over! Horrible acting, I mean every character was 1 dimensional and had no emotion whatsoever. The movie reminded me of Pumpkinhead but much much worse. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was because Lions Gate had it's Brand on it and I love Lions Gate flicks (most of em). The lead actress (the park Ranger or whatever lady) was just horrible. Her lines were so f'n cheesy and she delivered them even cheesier that it was unbearable to listen to her. I hope she never ""acts"" again. If this movie comes on tv, give it a shot but it's time you will never get back!!"
3,Not that great,"i was looking for a book on this subject, the writer the publisher, it all looked perfect. but the book is soooo boring, after reaching a long way into the book you waste your time on artists rooms and clubs!! really! then when we finally start, it is like for ever, the process seems so slow... the book ofcourse is full of the writers own sketches which might not appeal to every one. what you might find here, at this price, you'll find for sure in more cheaper and more focused more useful books. i wouldn't recommend it personally."
2,Rather boring,"This book was a disappointment, certainly not up to Robert's usual level of writing. The trip they made wasn't particularly adventurous (overhyped) and the constant whining made it tiresome to read. The only thing that kept it interesting was the information about the Anasazi and early white settlers, which was indeed fascinating."
2,Disappointing.,"I enjoyed reading ""The Secret Knowledge of Water"" and ""House of Rain;"" both books written by Craig Childs. So,I bought and read this book because Greg Childs acted as photographer in this traverse of Comb Ridge. And, Indeed, the photos are good. Unfortunatly, David Roberts, the author and traverse participant, comes off as needing total control of his hike companions. The writing seems choppy and more a personal journal than an adventure."
4,Loved it.,My sister recomended this book to me but I was already reading it.We both loved it. I highly recomend this book.
3,Long time coming,It was good.. Not my favorite. I really dont know if I would read this author again; I would pass it on to others that would like it..
4,A good read,"A love story with a few twists. The author puts you into the story, as if you could picture the characters and surroundings."
4,Good book,This was a good book to read during the Christmas break. Just a nice book. I will look for other booms by Edie.
4,Charming,"Very entertaining, I had a hard time putting it down. Everyone has a friend like Jenny , but everyone deserves to be happy."
4,Long Time Coming,"In this book teenage love is a surprise to one, but not to the ghost if you believe in ghosts. In the end all is happiness."
3,Good,I haven't got to it yet. It is a freebie. I have a lot of books to read that I haven't gotten to yet.
3,Little to long.....,I got bored and skipped chapters. Good ending ....less day to day get the point. Just didn't keep my attention.
4,I enjoyed this one.,I like some 'romantic mysteries' and this one was just a good light-reading-has-a-little-humor entertaining work. I also love animals so the fact that the main character is a veterinarian caught my attention. I already downloaded another book by this author.
4,A Long Time Coming Suspense,"A Long Time Coming is an enjoyable read. It has an interesting and somewhat unique plot, fascinating characters, and mystery. I did not care for the paranormal aspect but it did lend itself to suspense. I kept looking for a natural answer to some if the bizarre happenings. That said, the book was fascinating, kept my interest, and the ending did not disappoint. Good rainy day read!"
5,Great book!,"Much better than I would have expected from a free book - this was actually one of the better books I've read in quite some time! The characters were believable/relatable, and the story pulled me in from the start and kept me guessing till the end. This wasn't a ""scary"" book by any means, but it had a bit of a spooky vibe that kept me on the edge of my seat and made me want to keep reading way past my bedtime. This is the first book by Edie Claire that I've read, and I can't wait to read more of her work!"
3,Long Time Coming,"some slow parts but good story, surprises toward the end which made up for it. Would check on some of her other books"
1,Long Time Coming,Fast paced thriller. Read in one sitting- enjoyed vivid descriptions and character development in real life action. Will read other books by this author. 4 stars
1,So so book,I don't really like the book too much. It wasn't as interesting as I thought it will be. Just my opinion.
5,Long time coming,"Held my interest; well written; creative storyline; could not discern the ""who-done-it"" too soon. Prologue wraps up the story nicely! I am reading Eddie Claire's other books now."
4,Great mystery,This was a great read. Characters were perfectly delightful getting to know. The book had a good plot. It was an outstanding easy read.
3,"Great read, but......",I really liked the supense in the book however I was not a fan of the explicit sex and language. I don't feel like this is necessary ina story line to make a book interesting.
4,Not bad for a free book,"This author keeps you reading. She often repeats herself with character description and contradicts her characters personalities but if you can get past some of these rookies mistakes, the story is good and keeps you engaged. There were some page filling moments but not too bad. I felt is was a decent book and enjoyed the story."
3,Long time coming,This is the first time I have read this author and I was impressed the story made it hard to stop reading it and made me want to get to the end very good.
2,I had to finish the book!,"But for a very specific reason: to see if it would end as I suspected from about page 10 on! I thought surely there would be a twist or turn; but, alas, none appeared. I was glad when the book ended."
4,"Long time coming,","I liked the story in this book,it was just different compared to the books I usually read.I would recommand this to some friends."
3,This was ok.,Liked this book but not loved. Great weekend book. It kept me entertained though. Give it a shot and see what you think.
5,Great Book,Great and unexpected book. I was really surprised considering it was a freebie.... I will be reading her books again.
5,You can still come home,"I could not put this book down, from the moment Joy ran into Jeff, I knew without a doubt they would find one another...from the creepy old house to the watching after elderly parents I can relate well ...excellent story, I will definitely recommend to my friends!!!"
2,had potential..... at least it was free.,"This book started off great, but then went downhill fast. The storyline was very predictable. The main character's inner battles became tiresome and redundent."
4,Remembering Jenny.,I liked the book a lot. The characters were people you cared about and the mystery was intriguing. It took a while for Joy to see clearly. But the end was truly satisfying
5,An Excellent Author,"I truly enjoyed reading Long Time Coming and will be looking for other books from Edie Claire. A perfect diversion from reality, thanks."
3,A thrilling love story,"A love story that has a few twists and turns because of a ghostly presence in the plot...At times I was scared as there is quite a bit of suspense scattered throughout the book as a young woman tries to come to terms with a traumatic experience that happened to her when she was in high school.I enjoyed the book, which says a lot because I don't really like fiction."
5,Very good!,This book was great! Really a good read. Picked it up hoping for a diamond after several really bad ones and I am so glad I did! Read it people you will love it.
2,Don't know.,Can't say howmuch I liked it because I never did get to read all of it. Rental time is too short.
5,Held my interest,"Enjoyable read, deals with some real life issues, held my interest, ends on a happy note, some spirit topic covered"
2,Felt Predictable,"First off I guessed by the 3rd or 4th chapter what the problem would be so that's always dissapointing. And the book was ok, at time it held my interest but it felt very generic and odd.How could someone that old have repressed trauma for that long and no one doing anything about it? That seemed totally impossible; if she'd exhibited that much reclusive and maladaptive behavior for that many years, surely someone would have gotten her into counseling? Other than that, the love story was kind of sweet, but the guy was too perfect to be believed, and the paranormal stuff was silly/stupid/creepy to me - lol - just like to the villain of the story! The only part that rang true to me was when a neighbor tries to take over your parents as that happened to me and my sister. It didn't bother me that much but to this day it is a huge issue for my sister.So the book is a blend of the improbable, the impossible and the downright crazy. If that's your thing, you might like it!"
5,Very good read.,I enjoyed this book from begining to end. There were some laughs and also the tear jerking parts. I would recommend it.
3,Long Time Coming,"The story begins a little clumsily as if the author can't find her way. Get past that point and the tempo livens and the story becomes very interesting. and informative re vetinary work,"
4,Good Book,I just finished this book and it was interesting. It isn't your typical romance novel because there is a bit of a mystery involved. A good read overall.
5,Great Freebee,"I've never reviewed a book, and I am not a writer or a critic. I simply enjoy reading, and this book was real joy to read."
5,Nice Serum,"This Rejuvaskin serum is a good buy, has lots of the active ingredients, and works well. It gives the skin exactly what the title of it says, a rejuvanating effect, and makes the face more youthful and healthy. I also noticed a nice tightening effect. It has all of the same ingredients of other high dollar serums, but with a much more reasonable price. It can especially be beneficial with continued regular use!! Well worth a try, so give it one!!"
5,Excellent description of how Merrill Lynch operates,"In the Preface of his book, Mark Dempsey states, ""Out of fairness, however, I have withheld the name of the brokerage firm that I worked for."" Elsewhere he mentions that his previous job was selling radio advertising time. A check of the NASD list of past and present brokers includes a ""Mark Dempsey"" who, between 1992 and 1995 worked for Merrill Lynch in Dallas, TX. Prior to that, between 1985 and 1992, this ""Mr. Dempsey"" held sales positions with five different radio stations or networks. Coincidence?"
5,Konica Minolta X60 Digital Camer,The camera is an excellent piece of workmanship. It does everything the add says and much more. Everyone I have shown it to has been very impressed.
1,Pls DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is not a book for people who have gained weight due to a thyroid condition. I had my entire Thyroid removed a year ago and have gained twenty five pounds prior to the operation and that was in less than six months.This book only offers popular diet plans that are already available to the general public that have gained weight the old fashion way, through eating too much and not exercising enough or at all. Needless to say I am very dissapointed.In my entire life I have never gained so much weight and it's not due to my diet or lack of exercise. For me this is not a normal condition that can be cured with a low carb salad.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a REAL THYROID CONDITION and plan on donating it to the Library.I saw a news story about a Veterinarian who totally cured a monkey of any thyroid symptoms and I'm hoping that one day a human Doctor will be smart enough to figure out something for humans because there's nothing in this book that will."
2,Tell Me Something I DON'T Know,"Most woman with a thyroid problem are looking for some concrete information, not generalizations!!!! PLEASE, PLEASE TELL US SOMETHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW!!! Sorry, the book gave me no further information than what I already knew. This one goes in the pile with the other ""Expert"" writings on thyroidism."
5,LOTS OF INFO,THIS BOOK COVERS A LOT OF AREAS REGARDING THE THYROID. I'VE BEEN HYPO FOR A FEW YEARS & STILL FOUND STUFF IN THIS BOOK THAT WAS HELPFUL.
3,Not realistic,Eating this way is easier said then done and all the help seems to be us relying on doctors. Not sure anything works and getting help feels difficult.
2,Not for me,It did not fit my health requirements. My friend suggested i get this book but it wasn't suited for my needs.
1,Where's the Diet?,"This book was a total waste of time & money. We've all tried most of the diets ""listed"" in the book, having the author tell us ""you must find whatever works for you."" What bunk! I'll give her credit, she got my money."
5,Must Have Book for Hypothyroid!,"I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and put on medication a year ago and was still struggling to lose weight when I stumbled upon this book. I read it cover to cover in one day and everything started to make sense. It has a lot of helpful tips, including which supplements you should try. The book offers three types of diets to fit your lifestyle. (And the author clearly states several times that this is not a miracle diet book.)Since reading the book, I've started a new diet and I started doing pilates and yoga, based on the authors recommendations. I haven't felt this good in a long time! I wish they would have handed me this book when I was first diagnosed."
1,The Thyroid Diet: Manage your Metabolism,"What a disappointment. Expecting something new here, but didn't get it. Basically this is the GI diet - and if that doesn't work for you then there are a whole host of other well known diets suggested. Though the book begins by giving numerous examples of people who seem to eat little but get/stay fat, it goes on to trot out the usual 'eat less and exercise more' advice."
2,"Needs a more clear diet section, this was not worth buying","I have read on Hypothyroid and this is not the book I was looking for, as to help me to speed up my metabolism. I would like to find a book that just is plain and gives examples of diets and foods to eat. Disappointed...."
2,Get Catechism instead,You would have to be an idiot to take this for your guide to Catholicism. When this series treated other religions they seemed to be careful to follow the official teachings of that religion. Yet here they give equal credence to official teachings and dissent. This is dishonest and biased. Don't depend on this book to tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Catholicism. Get the Catechism of the Catholic Church instead.
1,Complete Idiot's Guide to understanding Catholicism,"This book is replete with misinformation. It appears more as a personal agenda than any type of guide. The authors rail agasinst the Church's teaching on contraception. They only mention the ""Rhythm Method,"" which is extremely misleading, while completely ignoring the scientifically and biologically based Natural Family Planning. They portray the depravity and immorality of Madonna (the singer/performer, not the Blessed Mother) as true Catholic mysticism, which under any circumstances is not. These are just two examples of the misleading misinformation contained in this book. The best part of this book happens to be the little boxes with snippets of information. Most of these are fairly accurate, but not worth buying this book. Readers who are looking for information and not an agenda would do better with the ""Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism."""
1,Ridiculous!,"Both chargers do NOT work with my ipod,the description of the item is FALSE ADVERTISING. People like them make buyers not shop at amazon..com.."
1,Disappointed!!,"I have bought some of these in the past and love them! But the newly designed lid only has a single seal instead of double, and it makes them easier to leak, if not porperly sealed and, horror! the juices that condensate on the lid run all the way to the edge now, so when you put the lid on again they come hoozing out from the sides!!! Not very convenient for taking them to work or anywhere where there is not a sink handy."
2,Not worth finishing,"I like this genre of novels. They are getting more popular and the competition is getting greater. So, the writing needs to be better. This is an example of lower quality writing. The characters have dialog that would sound silly from a person, let alone an angel. I tried to stay with it, but at one point it was no longer worth my time. Fall of Lucifer by Wendy Alec is much better."
3,huh,I'm new to Christian mythology but I felt Lucifer was a very one dimensional character in this book. And as he is a major player it made the story very difficult to get into. The premise was admiral but I felt the suspense and tension in the plot was lacking.It has always been my opinion that the most fascinating villians show an arc explaining how they became evil.This book would be best for those looking for a creative retelling of the bible not someone looking for new ideas.
4,An accessible introduction to low-dimensional topology.,This book treats (geometric) topology of dimensions two and three together with necessary machinery of group theory. The account is accessible if you have the basic knowledge of general topology and algebra. It well illustrates the inherent difficulties in low-dimensional topology. A mild surprise with this book is that Novikov's proof of the unsolvability of the word problem is fully described.
4,Good Workout,"Ok, Denise IS chatty but, she does know her stuff. And this DVD like her Shrink your Female Fat Zones, is very good at working out your entire body. I really like the ball exercises, it's not too exhausting, but you definitely feel it the next day!!!"
2,Just a bunch of chess articles,"I am rather disappointed after buying this book. It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ... it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole.I would rate it higher if it had title like 'Alex Yermolinsky selected chess articles'. But this book does not offer any organized plan of work towards reader chess improvement (ohh, there is suggestion to study own games on the beginning). So I am just disappointed after buying it."
3,Good book,This book is good if you can take the time to work through all the analysis presented by the author.
1,Disappointing book,"I am disappointed with this book. It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ... it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole."
3,ok camera,"a little disappointed with this camera. It is an ok camera, but for this price it was a let down.it takes a while to get used to all the features. You change one little thing and it drastically changes the shot, and you cant figure how to get back. when you place it back in same position, you meter still isnt right. white balance.... cant figure out how to customize it. ahh wellI really got it for the night shot featured on other sony cameras, but silly me, i mustta overlooked the fact, that they discontinued that on this model, HUGE let down. .looking to trade it up already for a f828 or a Nikon."
2,ALL THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE MADE IN THE SAME 2 WEEKS!,This is a books whose rating are most certainly pumped up by many optimisitc reviews giving 4 or 5 stars in the same 2 week timeframe. It really isn't as good as other books in this area. Look up other 'after college' books.
5,Non Pop Up Umbrella Drain,Drain looks great with my new Decolav vessel sink and matches my faucet. Plumber had no problem installing drain and it fit the sink perfectly.
5,Mystical and beautiful~~!,I play this cd everyday. The music reaches into the deepest places of your soul.
5,Top Shelf,For any serious handicappers this is a must read book.For those who are new to horse racing read and re-readto grasp all information.
5,Great book!,This book will help you to have conversations that actually matter. I found it valuable and helpful in so many ways!
1,Terribly boring and very beginner,"This dvd is terrible. I'm shocked by the 5 star reviews! It is designed for someone who has never worked out before and features horribly repetitive, 80s style aerobic moves. If you were exercising before you got pregnant, please don't waste your money on this."
