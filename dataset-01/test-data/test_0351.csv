5,Awesome shoes.,"I've been using this shoes for about a year now. It fits perfectly well, no problems at all. Very good build quality. Been using it everyday at work since I bought it."
5,Touching,"Four Spanish versions and one Portuguese Version of songs of the album ... Nothing Like The Sun"". The translation seems to be worked out well. The songs are personal, sensitive and touching. The voice of Sting is not only in English unique."
3,It's a mirror,"The mirror will definitely suit my needs for the price. Although I've had no problems yet, I can see how it could loosen up over time and not stay put. This is going on a Kawasaki Teryx."
1,"Horrible, a waste of money","I had to buy this book since it was mandated by the instructor to do so. It was so bad on so many levels. Maybe it was beyond my understanding, but it left me with no useful information. If you can avoid buying this book, I would do so. If you must buy it for a course, good luck!"
3,I returned it,"It is just a vaguely defined compillation of subjective advices about a host of completely different topics, written in the style of a pop magazine."
5,a great resource for 'site-security' design,"A very good basic resource for understanding what 'physical security' is about and how it can be combined with landscape design to look good and include public amenities. The best section is the collection of case studies of how it has been done well already, such as at official public buildings and public streetscapes. There's a good synopsis of the book on the NJ landscape architecture assoc. (...)"
2,"Looks-5 stars, function-1 star","I did a lot of research before buying this unit. After 4 months of use I am very disappointed with this product. This is definitely the best looking coffee maker I have ever purchased, but that is where the complements stop. The carafe dribbles all over the counter top. I have found this to happen even when I pour VERY slowly. My carafe is also very finicky. It must be placed perfectly or the drip mechanism is not engaged and coffee and coffee ground pour out of the top. BIG mess. Unfortunately, the complaints do not end there. The steam from the unit condenses behind the carafe and creates a big puddle every morning. And to be quite honest it doesn't really brew that great of a cup of coffee. So if you want a good looking machine, this is for you. However, if you like a functional machine that is convenient and brews an awesome cup of coffee keep looking. I know I am."
2,Don't buy.....,"The machine looks nice, however doesn't function very well. Coffee leaks while pouring from the carafe. Coffee leaks out of the unit when the carafe is removed to pour coffee in the middle of brewing. Overall poor design.......I'll be placing this in the next garage sale!"
2,company does not make replacement parts/filters hard to find,Hi!When shopping for a coffee maker I think it is really important that if it comes with the water filters you should be able to find replacement filters fairly easy but unfortunately you can only order the replacement filters for this unit from the manufacturer which is not cheap when you figure in shipping.anyone looking for a good machine should do a lot of research before purchasing...
2,Pouring is frustrating,I love the design and coffee tastes great but for $120+ I expect a coffee pot that pours without making a mess. This is the worst pouring pot I have ever had. I thought mine might have been defective but it appears to be a common problem based other reviews. Stay clear.
1,Very unhappy,"The coffee tastes fine but getting into a cup is impossible.you can not pour from this carafe without spilling coffee all over the kitchen, and I mean every time."
2,Disappointed,"We are very disappointed with this coffee maker. It DOES leak, has confusing instructions ( why would anyone want their machine to operate on military time???) and does not produce a hot cup of coffee. For the money, it is not worth it. Perhaps more time should have been spent on the operation of the machine and less on the ""retro"" look. Going back to Mr. Coffee!"
1,Not worth the money,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this coffee maker. I spent a lot of money, and now after less than a year, I am looking for a replacement, and it won't be another DeLonghi product. The gold filter disentegrated after 3 months. When it came time to replace the charcoal filter in the water filtration unit, I could not find anyone who carried them. I contacted DeLonghi, and they sent me to some online dealer who never returned my emails. The basket that holds the filters has a plastic piece that keeps falling off. And finally, believe everyone who says the carafe leaks when you pour the coffee. I thought they were just crazy and couldn't pour properly, but the only way to avoid half of your coffee running all over the counter is to hold the carafe over the sink at about three feet above your mug, then pour very very slowly. At least the drips will go down the drain.A lousy product."
4,DeLonghi Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker,"I had one of the very best cups of coffee I have ever had from my new DeLonghi Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker. It also is a very nice looking coffeemaker. There is only one little problem....when I go to pour a cup of coffee from the carafe, I drip coffee all over the counter. It has taken me a while to learn the proper angle to pour so that doesn't happen."
2,not very exciting,"The projects in this thin book are too advanced for the instructions given. The designs are pretty ""finished"" in some cases, but with just a couple of paragraphs describing what was done. My favorite project was the ""junk mirror"" with stuff glued to it and then painted. Still, it's way cooler than what a kid at this reading level could expect to make. Besides copying the various projects, the book didn't inspire me to make anything myself."
3,Examining Induction,"I wrote sometime ago:""There are a great many better books on fallacies and sophistry than this one. As one reviewer writes, it is over-written and tiresome in over-explicating cases. It's obvious that this book was written to accommodate the mass explosion of informal logic courses in some of our lesser-grade colleges. While the subject has been neglected over the years, and as yet, there's no single book that treats inductive reasoning and all the fallacies, there are many that are superior to this one. If this is the text used in your course, change courses.""I have to admit I was wrong about this book. It's better than I first thought, based on my repeated returns to it for the names of the various fallacies. I still think the book could have been better organized, but it's a richer book than I first thought."
5,I am very happy with this watch!,"This watch has a very pretty face background and the hands are very shiny and nicely shaped. The numbers are very easy to read from all angles. It is hard to get perspective from the picture, but it is only about an inch and a quarter from end to end where the band attaches. The leather band is fairly slim at only about a quarter inch wide. It is very comfortable and you hardly notice you are wearing it. If you prefer silver faced watches it is one of the nicest most reasonably priced watches I found available. If I could change anything on it I would opt for a wider band."
4,Nice,"Super cute and small, it works for what I need: attractive enough to use as a small wallet in public or small enough to hide in a purse. I can pack an extra battery, but it is tight. The good thing is that I can put money in this and combine this as a miny wallet (not much more would fit). Has extra pockets for memory cards, but don't see needing that function. One thing: I did buy the suade leather case, and parts of the case are starting to rub smooth. While the appearance is now a little ""used,"" I am still happy with how compact it is. Definitely worth it."
4,I have always lived this lady's voice.,This lady's voice has always been superb!!! Another lady is Elkie Brooks!! check out her treatment of WHATS THE MATTER BABY. if you like TIMI! you will like ELKIE.
1,You'd better already know Illustrator,"Don't buy this book unless you already know Illustrator. Not for beginners. Also, the step-by step tutorials contain several errors and incomplete information. All in all, this book really disappoints me."
5,Great product,"The first time I gave one of these to my 6-month-old daughter, she worked on it for 20 minutes! She is very busy, so that is quite amazing for her. She has no allergies, but I got these because I approved of the ingredient list. The biscuits are a great shape for little hands, long enough that they can get a good hold, but short enough that its easy to manipulate. She seemed to enjoy the flavor and texture. These are brown and get gummy and leave brown spots whenever she would drop them, but so far it has washed out of everything."
2,slow and monotonous,"I looked forward to this CD with great anticipation as I have loved James Taylor's work forever. However, I was so disappointed in this latest effort. There are a few pieces that are interesting, but for the most part it seems to contain the same sounds over and over again, from one piece to the next. Many individual songs have a good bit of repetition within them. There is very little upbeat sound, although the horns are nice, but overdone. The entire tempo is very slow. It is hard to hear the words on many of them. I will make sure to listen to excepts next time before purchasing."
1,What happend?,I am sitting listing to October Road for the first time and I am completely under-whelmed. What happened to JT the poet? This is nothing more than easy listening for adults meant to be played in dentist offices. I am very disappointed after a very strong Hourglass album. What's up with the saccharine background vocals?
1,Not feeling very good about this purchase right now,"Well, I had read another review of this all-in-one printer from someone who had a very frustrating beginning with this product: dead on arrival. I thought, well, sometimes glitches happen, and no company can promise 100% quality, right? Well, unfortunately it has happened to me, too. This machine made a horrible racket once I turned it on, spewed a bunch of ink in the bottom of the printer, and now I'll waiting another 5-7 business days for a replacement. Also, when I checked the ink levels in the brand-new cartridges, they were already down to 80%. I hope Epson can manage to send a functional machine, but with this being the first Epson product I've bought, I'm feeling pretty shakey about what to expect next."
2,Dont buy this,Was looking like a fairly good piece of kit until had an urgent requirement to scan at the same time as running out of ink. Now cant do anything until I replace the ink cartridges. Absolutely disgusted with it. How can it not let me scan just because it has no ink. Last time I checked ink is not a requirement of a scanner.
5,"Must Read for anything ""Competitive"" .. especially pool.","I enjoy pool ... but found the insights in this book apply to anything at all I do where ""winning"" is important. So much of what we do, if we want to bring our ""A Game"" to the table, is controlled by our state of mind. This is the book to read to give yourself an edge you simply can't find anywhere else to keep yourself in the game, enjoy the game at all levels, and take yourself to the next (and next and next) level. Jim Stevens http://savingfuelnow.com"
2,a bit much,"This had some great reviews.. but it was beyond agonizing to get through.I thought the first few pages I read in this book was a wordy intro that would clear up soon after-- it's the same all the way through.I found myself desperately looking for a point, which led me to do something I've never found to actually work before- and am suggesting: Read this book backwards."
4,"A lovely, quite intimate album, with lots to it.","I think this is top stuff. Leila did this album in her bedroom, with friends helping, guesting as singers. It has a sort of rough, un-slick, 'first effort' slightly flawed feel, but at the same time is very lush & full of sounds. It's very very good, interesting, thoughtful, with layer upon layer of samples. I suppose it's a bit like the trippier side of The Orb or Unkle, mixed with Stina Nordenstam, if you get my meaning. I hope we get another one soon."
3,"Not practical, theoretical instead.","It does contain some helpful ASHRAE tables, but it is not very practical. It is a theoretical explanation of HVAC engineering principles rather than a practical HVAC design guide. If you want a theoretical book, then this is a good one."
3,didn't meet expectations for noise blocking,"I got these headphones to block the sound of people talking at work, and they did not meet my expectations. I expected these headphones to block out a lot more sound than they do - with no sound playing through the headphones, they have almost no sound-blocking effect in my office setting. I now play white noise through them, which works to block distractions. These are made to block airplane noise, and I have not tested them on an airplane."
3,Pretty good,"This is pretty good for what it does, I'd probably give it more like 3.5 stars. It blocks out a decent amount of noise, although not all noise (it reduces ambient noise to more like a whisper). It's heavier than I expected, but I probably was naive about thinking it wouldn't. I use it when I go running because I live in an area with a lot of traffic noise, and the most surprising thing for me is that it quickly developed a knocking noise in one side. I assume it's probably not designed for the constant jar of jogging, and that a little piece must have gotten knocked loose. So I was disappointed by that.But for things like blocking out the noise of lawn mowers, weed eaters, airplanes, traffic, etc., it does great!"
2,"Noise reduction: YES, Good sound: NO","Excellent noise reduction.tight fit, get loose with time (or on a book overnight)less than mediocre sound quality. no lows at all, lacks volume."
2,"Not what I expected or needed, and not for beginners.","I ordered this book, looked it over, and sent it back. I'm a relative beginner to watercolors. I wanted something step-by-step, and from the description, I thought the book would have many projects and paintings to try. This is not the case. It has page after page of vague suggestions for techniques--this author is especially enthralled by spraying water and paint onto the paper from spray bottles--not what I was interested in at all. This book might be good for painters who are accomplished and want to try new techniques, but I wanted a basic book with basic techniques. I also wanted some step-by-step paintings, something that an experienced painter probably wouldn't need. This book is not for beginners."
1,You will be disappointed,"This is one of the worst films this one has had the displeasure to have purchsed and have watched. The other reviews that praise this movie are very misleading. To put it simply, this film stinks. The cinematography is horrid, the music is worse (Western pop from the sixties), the story line is pitiful and there is no acting in this film. It is not a drama nor a comedy. It is a tragedy. This movie was given one star because reviewers are not allowed to give no stars. Amazon.com should be more honest in the reviews they promote if they want return customers.DON'T BUY THIS FILM. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY."
3,Too academic,"This book is part of the required readings for my theory construction class, I find it dry and difficult to understand. The plus side is that it`s short."
4,Crowded House Fan's Review,"I'm a Crowded House fan looking back at what the Finn brothers have done.I've only just heard this CD, and my judgement is mixed. There are some truly beautiful songs. Split Enz really had a way of injecting feeling into some of them. All round a very good CD, with some plain tracks."
5,"Basically, I Love It","This album is such a welcome return to Robin's signature style...all except the last track, (a bit too dissonant for me) I very much enjoy playing it often, and am so glad I finally bought it. Thanks Robin!!"
1,talking in a wind tunnel,oh my lord what a piece of junk. so much background noise on both ends. just dont do it to yourself.
4,Beautiful thank you gift. Friends loved it.,"I purchased this as a gift for good friends that had invited us over for Christmas dinner. They live in the wine country and had broken their decanter the week before dinner. I sent them this as a thank you gift, they sincerely loved its simple elegant lines. Good wine should be decanted.Top quality look and feel. Highly recommended."
5,Truly A Blessing,"Dorothy Norwood brings this beauitful and touching album of Hattie B's Daughter, it is remarkabley beautiful because of its personal touch of spirituality. I enjoyed the closeing of this album because of the alter call to those who desired to go into the ministry, and those in of need salvation, this is what ministry is all about.""The Storm Is Almost Gone"", a very moving and touching charismatic hand clapping tune brings delight and uplift to the opening of this album, ""I'll Make It To The Promise Land"" , and ""The Lord Has Need Of Thee"" are very moving songs of inspiration, all of the tracks are great ,but I especialy enjoy these selections. This is truly an uplifting album that will leave you full of joy and smiles. If you don't have this album, and you love gospel music hurry and get it! its truly a blessing."
5,~~~One of Lamb's Best ~~~,"This is whithout a doubt one of the best Lamb's albums ever.The Year of Jubilee reminds us that as long as we are with our Lord, every year is the Year of Jubilee (when the lame shall walk and the blind shall see...).The compositions by Joel Chernoff and the productions and arrangements by Rick Coghill that year of 1985 were right on the money, perfect; songs that became a landmark in Christian/Messianic music up until now. Songs like ""Pray for Jerusalem"" have become more and more congruent with what's been happening in the world.Every song is a winner, so if you're looking for a very good Christian CD with lots of rhythm and annointment; this should be at the top of that list, easy.........Baruch Ha Ba Yeshua !!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not very useful,"This book has very little practical value, filled with useless aphorisms. Everything's obvious and purely commonsensical--nothing anyone wouldn't know already. Mostly this is an opportunity for the author to congratulate himself on his career as an advertising executive. This book, too, looks like it was self-printed through a vanity press. Otherwise it would have never made it to the light of day. A waste of money."
2,Flimsy and don't latch closed well.,These caps keep flipping open on their own. They are cheaply constructed and the covers' 'latch' is a joke. I replaced them with Weaver polar caps that are a much better product.
3,Decent start for beginners in real estate,"While I have had this book for awhile now, it still is one of the better books for beginners in real estate investing. It covers a lot of topics broadly. It is good in that it gives you a general idea of major concepts and then you would have to either do more research or read another book to learn more about a particular subject. The cartoons are also helpful in keeping the book light and funny. Overall, a good book for beginners who want to a high level knowledge of general concepts in real estate investing."
3,"Great price, but fit is a little loose","I bought four of these plug adapters for a recent trip to Australia. The price was great and they did the job. My only complaint is that the side with the US socket had a slightly loose fit and it was a little too easy to unplug the device. This was true of all four units and with a number of different devices. Still, for the price I would still recommend these."
3,"They work, but are a bit ""floppy""","They worked, but were not a tight fit to the outlet. I ended up using a chair leg against them to keep the connection firm. Not an ideal solution, but it did work. I'd have gladly spent a bit more money to avoid this fix."
1,ripoff,this dvd has to many interviews cutting into the songsyou dont get to hear the song from start to finish.save the interviews for the end.
2,"OK, but not great","As huge JT fan, I was hoping for more complete songs on the disc..interesting interviews, but I watch all my oncerts with cordless headphones while on the treadmill & stationary bike, and desire more concert-style dvds to avoid skipping the interview tracks."
2,Is it really worth ( )?,I've read many books about how to succeed after college but this one seems to fall short of a few important points. I would stick to Patrick Combs and his many books about the same subject.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This machine is worthless. It worked on two CDs and completely stopped working. The copies I make now don't play on most of my other machines, and when they do, they have skips and distortion. The manual is completely unhelpful. Harmon Kardon technical support is nonexistent. I wasted $500 on a system that does not work. Please don't make the same mistake. Either try a different brand, or wait a year until they get the technology right."
3,bad copies,"The Harman kardon CDR 20 is a great burner, except the fact that when you dub cd's, various tracks have a distortion and a static error on them."
2,KEEP YOUR MONEY,"Although a good treatise on one arm pushups and one leg squats, this ""book"" is really nothing more than a ""pamphlet"" with VERY big pictures and VERY big letters. Dowse this lack of content with some ""secret Soviet Spetznaz"" hoo-ha and you have an instant hit for the low, low price of.......well you get the picture. Oh, and if that is not enough hoo-ha, there are plenty of pages dedicated to all of the other ""secret soviet"" programs that Pavel peddles for ridiculous amounts of money. Unless you are simply a die-hard Pavel fan, your cash would be better spent on.....lets see...anything."
2,Expensive,"That's all I'll say but when you get it and start reading it, you will probably feel cheated because reading this review you already have now what you'll have then, just trust in yourself and be consistent."
5,my soundtrack,"I listened to this album so many times my senior year, I think I wore out the vinyl! I loved and sang along with every song several times a day, much to my brother's dismay. I recently watched the movie with my daughter, and she loved it, too. With 80's type music coming back, I think this could be added to the collection of todays kids as well as us nostalgic adults."
3,Excellent primer on logic and thinking,"Shaw writes an excellent primer on logic that is easily read and easily understood. He uses a minimum of symbols and peppers the book with examples and problems throughout each chapter. The book is really more about right thinking than formal logic and as such he includes chapters on probability, statistics, and language. Really a nice little book that covers just about everything in a first year college course."
3,Oh no! Bono again!,"Why only 3 stars? One for Cave, one for Jarvis, and another one for Mr.Cohen himself. I really think Mr.Cohen deserved a real tribute concert film with people like Tom Waits, Tindersticks, Richard Hawley, or Lambchop, just to name a few. Antony and Rufus Wainwright would have been perfect for a Boy George, Pet Shop Boys or Michael Jackson tribute concert/album. What are they doing here? And Bono and his articulate guitarist? Yes,Bono again.It's a strange world indeed."
3,Good Cohen -- Bad interpretation,"I have followed LC written and sung since the 60s, and have liked Judy Collins, k d laing, even Jenifer Warnes covers. But this CD just didn't seem right. Cohen seemed to mumble, I couldn't understand some of what was being talked about. None of the acts made me want to go out and buy an album by the artists -- except maybe Martha Wainwright. They all seemed either too weird or unmusical."
3,"performance great, DVD flawed","I had previously seen this show and had it on my DVR until the box went bad, so we lost it when the box was replaced. I knew the show itself was outstanding, and was excited to find that there was a DVD of it. Unfortunately, the DVD we received had several flaws, so it froze several times and we had to skip forward and, therefore, miss parts of the performance. In addition, even though his song ""Anthem"" is listed in the credits, and was performed in the show we had previously recorded, it is not on this DVD. It almost appears that the DVD was pirated."
3,Worth Watching for Cohen Diehards,"An interesting look at the variety of artists that have been influenced by Leonard Cohen. The performances of Cohen's works by others were of varing quality, but the biographical and interview information was first rate."
5,Rock solid UPS,"Beyond impressed with the APC Backup-UPS. The LCD display is well worth getting since allows real-time monitoring of UPS state.I turned off the power and ran the UPS for 15 minutes and noise level is well within reason. After turning power back on UPS recharged in little over one hour from 40% to 100%.UPS also comes with PowerChute software it maybe 3 years old but has all you need. This APC uses personal version and support old windows OSs, XP, Vista, and Mac OSX 10.3.9 thru 10,4.9. Expect them to release a WIN7 version soon also.I have the following connected (32"" LCD HDTV, Dell E510 Dual Core, DSL Modem, External HDD, 5.1 speaker, and running a game use 80% CPU power). That is 260 watts of the 865 watts possible. We even connected friends new quadcore with new DX11 video card and UPS had power to spare.If you have a high end PC or Mac it is well worth getting this UPS."
1,Where is the quality control?,"I have been a fan of APC in the past, but both BR1500LCD units that I recently ordered had quality control issues. The first one buzzed and smelled like warm plastic, and the other I didn't even want to plug in as the outer casing appeared to be warped and/or have something pressing against it from the inside.Disappointing.Kudos to Amazon for taking care of it promptly and painlessly."
4,Rock Solid,Great little UPS that does the job. Just remember to schedule on your calendar to replace batteries after 4 years!
5,Solid,"Haven't officially used it yet, but it was exactly what I was looking for. Heavy, strong, and solid. I'm sure I'll love it."
4,Does the Job and Does It Well,"Just had a chance to try out the bacon press tonight for BLT's--it works great!We love our bacon nice and crisp, and this little press does the job great and seems to speed up cooking time (perhaps because the cast iron ""holds in the heat"" while the bacon fries?).Bacon was crisp and delicious; the press prevents bacon curling and relieves you of the neverending task of flipping bacon over and over and over again when cooked conventionally.This press is a great addition to my kitchen; only gave it 4 stars, simply because it isn't quite as heavy as I would like, although it still performs well.Just make sure you season it before first use (directions in the box---just oil the press, oil a frying pan, then heat both together on VERY low heat for 20 minutes.Allow to cool and wipe excess oil off press). But don't use it with nonstick pans!"
5,Meaningful and Inspiring,"Swander does some important legwork for everyone who has suffered chronic illness and/or pain and wondered why, why, why, and how can I be healed ?!She describes her journey to New Mexico and her hopes for finding healing there, but she discovers so much more than healing. She shares with us the wisdom of a Catholic monk, a woman with a gift for prescribing herbal remedies, and mystics such as Hildegard of Bingen, St. John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, and St. Francis. The book also touches on other topics such as the medical establishment, meditation, the history of women healers, and relevant episodes of the author's family life. This book is a wonderful treat stuffed full of inspirational messages, information and ideas that most of us can relate to."
1,Good in Idea but Not in Execution,"As a New Mexico resident and a lover of the desert, I had high hopes for this book when I plucked it off a shelf and bought it based on the description on back. Clearly the author's story is poignant and inspiring, but that really gets lost in barely mediocre writing. Swander grossly minimizes details related to New Mexico and its cultures, and she does the same with her descriptions of mystical figures and religion, and these sort of bald descriptions & generalizations really weaken the power of the story and her credibility as a writer. This propensity also makes the story feel unfocused and unguided. The book just doesn't read very authentically. I wish I had a different experience reading it, but I didn't."
4,"Tasty, Healthy Treat is Wheat, Soy and Dairy-Free","TEDDY PUFFS are a tasty, healthy treat. My toddler enjoys them. I have taste tested them (just for research, you understand), and like them, too.I especially like that they are not overly sweet. In the course of searching for some good wheat and dairy free finger foods, I have found that many cereals are far sweeter than I want to feed to my child, even ""health food"" brands.One thing you will want to know about them is that they are a little denser and crisper than you might expect a ""puff"" to be. The texture is closer to that of a biter biscuit than a crumbly cookie. My toddler does not have any molars yet, and has to work on a TEDDY PUFF for a while before he can swallow it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Thanks for requesting my input, Amazon.com.I purchased two of these batteries so that I could carry a charged spare with me. That was a good thing because, combined, these two batteries don't even last as long as the battery they were intended to replace. I write ""intended"" because I kept the old battery and now I just rotate them. They even look like OEM batteries...so sad."
4,Excellent Deal!,"Nice shoes, very classy but they are firm until you break them in, they rub up against my angle bone."
1,Dont waste your time with 'new' Lamb.,"Lamb 1 and 2 - good.Lamb 3 and Songs for the Flock - Brilliant in every way.Everything after these 4 - dont waste your time.They dont have the depth, beauty, annointing, mystery, feeling,soul, magic - anything that the first 4 have.Im sorry I have to be so negative, buts its sad that a group that was, (in my opinion) the best Christian group there ever was; become one of the worst.Joel and rick, if your reading this:Rivers of Babylon is better than Stairway to Heaven.Listen to Lamb 3 again and go back into the studio.I love you guys.Jesus has more to say through you.Plus Christian music is lacking to say the least.We need you guys."
5,Not available?,"After watching the ""making of"" video about this album, I came right to Amazon to download the album. Imagine my surprise to find my two favorite cuts off the album listed as ""unavailable."" What's that about?If you want serious music-lovers to take your service seriously, treat us with respect. Don't play with us -- you can buy some of the album, but not the whole thing.I'm off to buy it on itunes -- they let me download the ENTIRE album -- I'd rather hear it ALL at lower quality than not get the entire album.Edit: Since I originally wrote this review, I notice that the offer has changed, and ALL cuts are now available, although two of the best are only available if you buy the entire album. Still, Amazon solved the problem, and the album is definitely worth a listen!"
4,GrownUpMusic.com recommended!,"If it worked for Ray Charles, why not team Herbie Hancock with a dozen vocal luminaries and turn them loose in every Starbucks in America? A little integrity is lost by including Christina Aguilera, who pretty much destroys ""A Song for You."" But after Sting, Annie Lennox, Paul Simon and John Mayer get a crack at the mic, all is forgiven. Hancock's white-hot ivory ticklers haven't been put to such good use in a long time. Sure, it's a purely commercial venture, but you'd be hard pressed to put together a mix tape (or a cocktail party soundtrack) this good."
5,Herbie Hancock-Possibilities,"this cd is fantastic, this cd might of been put out in 2006 but when I seen the Documentary on this I could not wait to get it & it has been truly a reward...EXCELLENT!!!!"
5,music we love,PossibilitiesFrom 2007 this has got to be one of the best. We can't what to get the 2008 release...
4,Real people in a historic setting,Interesting plot involving non-plastic people. A unique story line unlike the rest of the genre. Can't wait for his next.
1,Long and Drawn-Out.,"The description on the flap of the book describes a fast-paced, action-packed thriller with CIA intel that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. What I found out was the exact oppossite.It starts out giving the reader very little detail about the characters and their purpose. It is incredibly boring until you reach about page 132. It then gets a little exciting but it is truly nothing to ""write"" home about. The hero (A. Fannin) in the book does nothing expectacular to win the readers over (except grow a beard). He doesn't have the backbone for war.I struggled through the entire book in hopes of it picking up pace. Instead of calling it the 'The Black Tulip"" it should be titled, ""The Big Pansy""."
5,"Swinging, Melodic, and Beautiful!","To fans of beautiful songs, swinging repertoire and lovely interpretation, you must become acquainted with Ronald Douglas.He is Dutch, and yet, so American-sounding.I defey you to detect an accent, and he makes it all sound so easy! His song choices are interesting and wonderful,and his melodic and syncopated choices are right on the money.Ronald is always in full control of his instrument, something so lacking in too many of the current vocalists. He sings with warmth and feeling and really connects.Be sure to listen to a few of my favorites - No Moon At All,Day By Day,and With Every Breath I Take. Each one so different, clearly demonstrating the versatility that only a good singer is able to exhibit.Heartily recommended to music lovers, American Songbook lovers and fans of quality vocal performances!"
2,Fairly irritating disappointment,"Despite claims to the contrary, this model DOES NOT deal well with CD-R's or enhanced CD's. I make compilations constantly, and these homemade compilations play on all machines but my Harman Kardon FL 8380. Other irritants include the fact that it takes forever to turn on, and it then must cycle through every CD in the machine before allowing you to play music. This cycling happens even after you replace a disc. After a disc is through playing, it returns to that disc if you've opened the machine during the time that disc is playing. The sound is terrific, but the other factors override the sound for me. I will be replacing this machine even though I've only owned it for 6 months"
4,Surprisingly-Good Movie,"This was one of those rare cases in which the opposite of what you often see in films occurs: we get a movie that should have been stupid and hokey but turned out to be well-done and a good thriller. Yes, it's a very pleasant surprise.A man invents a machine which can switch the inward beings (at least the brain) of two humans so....the doctor winds up being a killer while the killer becomes him, the doctor in actions and thoughts. This ""fact"" is hidden because the two people still have the old face and body of the person they used to be, so no one else can see the two people have switched ""identities.""Anyway.....there is very good suspense in this film as the good guy tries to save his wife and family from being killed by the deranged human. Yeah, I know....it sounds confusing and stupid, but it isn't. The film also boasts a few shocking scenes and twists at the end. Recommended."
5,the IRON CANADIAN PRIEST,This canadian six man band is an unstoppable force that you should cross paths with in your cd collection.This is an alien breed of metal that will get u headbanging and moshing in your bedroom . On first listen u are pulled in by the iron maiden style of music and the judas priest style vocals( also somtimes iron maiden) by cam pipes and also the wicked harsh vocals by jamie hooper.Three inches of blood has dual guitar that rides u into the battle with drums and bass that gallop along side onward to victory.Three inches of blood is an army that is destroying.Soon enough they will Advance and Vanquish us all.
3,The voice,"I recently bought this cd because of the sound samples. The guys voice was really cool, what a mistake. While the cd has some cool points, the voice is nails on a chalk board. The cds alright in small amounts, but the whole album at once, get some asprin."
4,Good Book - fast delivery,"This is a good specification. It has clear definitions and good examples. This book is very helpful if you need to refresh your memory fast. Maybe this book doesn't have enough cross-references.For example, when they give a list of 48 keywords I expect a link to the article about this particular one following each keyword."
3,"Works fine, bit pricy","This works just fine for what I used it with, tuning home theater. It is a bit pricy buy shipped acceptably quick and works just fine."
4,Very Cool but So-So Quality,"This half yard ale glass is a very cool item - definitely will make you look like a serious/stylish beer lover. The stand is sturdy and well made, but the wood is not of high quality (unfamiliar Asian hardwood). The half yard glass itself is nicely made and has a nice thick lip around the mouth which should help it to survive longer without being chipped or broken. This item is made in China, but the clearance price of $11.99 makes this item a steal no matter what!"
2,"Gone in 60 Seconds 2 was great, everything else a letdown",I'm from Toby's hometown and really enjoyed the unfinished Gone in 60 Seconds 2 which was filmed in our area. Great to see some locals in the movie. I would have purchased for just this unfinished footage. Deadline Auto Theft was huge let down. It was most of the orginal Gone in 60 Seconds. I own that and Junkman and my kids and I have always enjoyed the car chases.
3,Three = One?,"I started watching this movie, Deadline Auto Theft, and about 10 minutes into the movie I realized, that it seemed rather familiar. Then it hit me, it was the same as the first movie, just with a different introduction. The only difference between the Third and First movies is the opening car chase and then minor scenes within the movie to tie in that opening scene with the rest of the movie. At first I though that I just got a faulty DVD or something and that there was a mistake, but then I noticed that in the extra part of the the DVD there was the trailers to all three movies. I watched the first and third trailers, and those were basically the exact same thing. Again, they put in the one different car chase, and changed the name, but other than that, it was the same trailer too. All in all, it was still a good movie, because so is the first one, but I wish there was actually a different story line, or something different about it."
3,"Great, just not great enough...","Part 2 of the Andromeda Saga, and it's a great ride. Video is sharp, audio is crisp, and its easy to navigate. Andromeda without commercials is definately the way to see it.The down side? No closed captioning (really helpful when trying to steal a few minutes while the baby sleeps) and not enough commentary (only on 1 episode out of 5?? Come on, Kevin, you can talk more than that!!)All in all, a definite buy for the sci-fi fan; and not bad for anyone else."
2,Radio/CD full of technical problems,I purchsed this under cabinet radio/cd because we spend lots of time in the kitchen and lack counter space. The radio and Cd sound ok for the price but there are several problems. 1st - the volume constantly goes up and down without a pattern. 2nd - there has been many nights where some alarm goes of at midnight for no reason. 3rd - I find the controls awkward and the directions provided are useless
1,Terrible Radio Sound,The radio reception sounds like I am listening to bad audio on a jet airplane. Radio stations have a loud whirring sound unless I turn the radio off and then on again multiple times. CD is OK. I am currently searching for another under counter unit to replace this one as it is so annoying to listen to the radio.
2,"Nice idea, decent CD sound, terrible radio","I bought this and installed it, and listened to a CD. So far, so good. Then I turned on the radio. Reception was terrible -- to the point where I suspected something was wrong with the unit. I exchanged it for another unit, and the same thing occurred. No matter where it went in my house, there was a strong low-frequency hum (as if I was listening to this on an airplane), and it made listening to anything (even NPR) unpleasant. I returned it again for a refund :-("
5,Quite simply? Fantastic!,"There's not a guy who's heard this CD on my stereo or iPod who hasn't asked, ""Who is that playing the guitar?"" Yeah, no kidding, Sonny Landreth is da bomb, and Grant Street is a fantastic CD. Buy it if you enjoy superb guitar playing, you could not possibly be disappointed.Grant Street"
5,Landreth at his best!,I caught Sonny on tour last year and thought he was great. Almost all the material from his performance is on this CD and it really showcases his music. I am really impressed with Sonny and his bandmates in concert and here on the CD. Sonny's voice has really improved over the years and is now a strength. Of course his guitar playing ranges from excellent to phenomenal as always. I think this CD really does catch Landreth at his best. Every fan should own this recording and it's a great place for any newcomers to Sonny's sound to start.
2,Bad for me!,"I bought this book with the intention to learn something but i have not. The book is sectioned into lengthy paragraphs. the author also throws in some comments and interviews from other investment guru (how guru are they) but it makes reading even more confusing,more often, the interviews serve no purpose to the chapter and tends to deviate away from topic.A better book would be ""The trading habits of warren buffett and georege soros""A bad book for new investors."
2,questionable finance statements,"pg 47 ""If the earnings yield of a given stock is much higher than Treasury bill interest rates (that is, if the P/E ratio is low), then many investoirs think that the stock constitutes a good investment"". hmm... actually NO. This is incorrect. Two stocks with identical E's, but on has a lower P (and therefore lower P/E) means investors view a higher degree of risk in that E being deliverd = they don't think its as good/safe as an investment as the high P/E stock. I stopped after reading this sentence, since this guy doesn't know what he is talking about. He also refers to depreciation as ""depreciations"" throughout the book!?!?"
1,waste of time and money,"much inferior to the warren buffett way, not to say the making of an american capitalist,in the begining of the book, the author says he will analyse buffett's investment in commodities and give a book list for further study, but these are no where to be found in the book,what do you expect from such an author?another chapter 'buffett's personal holdings' just copy all the charts and figures from yahoo, without any analysis of why buffett bought and sold them, what is it if not just for making the book thicker to sell more money,another chapter just summaries buffett's articles in fortune, again where is the originality?most unfortunately i bought it from a book shop that has no refund policy"
4,"For the ""Burning Shark"" idiot","The music here is classic Great White, as only Great White has the balls (or the talent) to cover the majority of these songs, without a straggling member of Led Zep present. Nothing more to say; here, the music does all the talking.As for the cover art, it is a classic play on Led Zeppelin I, where the Hindenburg is seen striking the aerial tower, igniting into a ball of flame. Since this is Great White covering Led Zeppelin, it is a clear mixture of a great white shark, combusting the same as the lead zeppelin aircraft did... idiot!Study your history, and your classic albums."
4,Setting the record straight,"Amazon's bibliographical citation for this work is way off; you'd be lucky to find it in a reputable library catalog if you tried looking up this sloppy job. The proper title is ""Herbert Spencer on Social Evolution""; the editor of the selection is J.D.Y. Peel; and it is published in the U. of Chicago Press's series ""The Heritage of Sociology"" (NOT ""... Society."") It's a good selection of Spencer's writings, including brief extracts from his letters. I was about to sell my copy when I started browsing through it again -- and decided to keep it."
3,ok not my favorite,"I think the Cha, Cha, Cha (Spanish learning songs) cd is better for Spanish immersion. However these are ok. I thought it would be more ""song"" like instead it's not her just singing a word in both Spanish and English. Like Rojo, Red...But not a real song to go with it."
4,Love and Sex in a Big City,"Those who criticized the book for lacking the spirit of Shanghai- who say that it could take place in any large city- missed Wei Hui's point. The main character is a 27 year old girl finding her way through the glitter and glam of a large city teaming with global influences. This is no traditional China and she is certainly not a traditional girl. Whether or not Wei Hui is the voice of a new generation and whether or not this book represents those born in China (or at least Shanghai) in the 70s is not important. Its not a glimpse into the China foreigners love to imagine- its a glimpse into the life of a twenty-something beatnik city dweller who just happens to be Chinese. If you want a book about love and sex that reads like the poetic prose of Banana Yoshimoto you've found the book. If you're looking for something that depicts the stereotypes of Asian women that you have in your head, go read something else."
2,not horrible but not very readable either,"I was at the San Francisco airport when I first saw this book. I almost bought it based on the sexy sounding blurb and the picture on the cover. However, I decided to wait until I returned home and now I'm glad I did. When I came home, I borrowed this book from the library, and am so glad I didn't make an impulse buy at the airport. It might be due to the translation, (something almost always gets lost in the translation) but this book seemed quite shallow to me, and overall it was not very interesting. As I said, it may be due to the translation, but the writing style irritated me, and there were many tired cliches. I enjoy reading literature by Asians and Asian-Americans, but for some reason this story didn't sit well with me. My advice is to borrow this, not buy it. The author is very pretty and the story sounds sexy and exciting, but it's really not very interesting when you get down to it."
1,very superfacial,"I find the characters in the book very superfacial, particularly the Baby, to the point, she is annoying.Maybe it is banned, because it is too bad. Very pathetic!"
2,shallow river,"I must admit it's kind of surprising to find such a degree of directness in a novel set against the backdrop of an oriental city like Shanghai. I never expected to encounter sex as steamy as dim-sum. But after an initiation in modern China's version of 'sex, drugs and rock 'n roll', I couldn't help thinking: 'What's next? When does 'it' happen?' But there is no 'it' to happen. Like a shallow river this novel keeps on flowing, but fails to reach any depth. It is like fast food: convenient enough to appease one's hunger, but too superficial to make a lasting impression."
4,Fresh and New,"This book is avant-garde and contemporary. In spite its ban in China, it shows how far Chinese culture has come since the days of Communism. Shanghai Baby, by Wei Hui, is translated by Bruce Humes. The story is about a rebellious twenty-something Chinese woman name Coco, who aspires to be a writer and follows her ambition at her boyfriend's suggestion. Meanwhile, she begins to discover her inner identity through her relationships with her rich, Chinese boyfriend and her tall, handsome German lover. Her life is further complicated by her social circuit. For the first time in her life, Coco questions her own control of life. This beautifully written novel grabs hold of all the senses and emotions and forces us to confront our own identity."
3,Ok,"This book was an ok read. Not quite as controversial as I thought it would be for all the controversy it caused. It is the story of the narcissistic main character and her endless problems, most of which she creates herself. I would borrow this book from the library to read, but wouldn't necessarily buy it."
3,Writing what you know,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though I cringe at her pretentiousness (the party, ugh!)Overall,she spoke for a speficic group of her generation and her own experiences and to me that is no different from the writer of Sex & The City who sees the funny side of her life and the people she hangs around with. It takes a while to learn to write about everybody but even then I don't think it is possible. Perharps in her next book, Wei Hui might want to inject a bit of humour. In conclusion, I praise her for being bold. I prefer this to someone writing a sorry story and expect the rest of the world to be moralistic about their plight."
2,Lots of sex scenes with little content,"I read the Original Chinese version, I find it rather dissapointing. With all the hypes about this new raising author, I thought the story was pretty shallow.A lot of details on sex scenes and derogative lifestyles of the new Shanghainese generation. The main character's emotional struggle with her impotant soul mate and her attractive but married foreign boy friend didn't end well.Overall, I find there's just too much publicity given to the author and the book, but the book is dissapointing."
2,Disappointing,"The Desiree Shapiro mysteries at first glance seemed to have a lot of promise, but I found the characters to be one dimensional and the mysteries to be just plain boring. I gave up on this book half way through, not caring ""who done it""."
1,"Cute shoe, HORRIBLE construction","I really wanted to love these shoes, they're really cute and comfy. BUT, I wore them one time and the front seam ripped, exposing my big toe on the right side. The left side seam was starting to come undone too. These are not too tight, in fact they fit loosely, so they didn't break from over stretching. These are not constructed well, even though the leather seems to be good quality. Just be aware, these are not the high quality moccasins that Minnetonka used to produce. Not worth the extra money for the name. I had to return my pair, I hope Amazon comes through with the refund."
1,Wrong item,"This is my first time buying goods in Amazon, however it isn't a pleased result. Both the picture and the description on the Amazon website show it is a Hardsole shoes, rubber sole shoes. When I receive the shoes, it disappointed me a lot cause it is softsole. I can't wear them outdoor. I really hope shoebuy could give our customer a pleased feedback. Unfortunatly, it has't been solved now."
4,CN,The shoe is very comfortable. But next time i get one i will get it a size smaller becaused it stretched out a little.
3,Undersized a lot,"It appeared to be a nice moccasin, but it was very undersized when my wife tried it on. Short and narrow. So I may try again, and order a size or two larger, but I'm thinking stop by a store."
4,Strethchy,"I wear a 9.5 normally, and I heard these mocs run large so I bought a 9. Waaaayyyy too big, so I exchanged for an 8.5 which fit perfectly when I first wore them However after a few wears they are too loose. I tried tightening the leather straps but its no good. The are still very cute, I just wish I knew better before I bought them. Therefore, 4 stars instead of 5. 5 for cuteness, 4 because of fit."
5,Perfect Moccasins,"After reading all the reviews I was nervous about ordering them, I normally wear a size 6 &+ my foot is wide so I ordered a 5.5reg, I had to return them to order a 5, but the width was perfect. I love them so much, the quality is amazing &+ I can tell they are going to last awhile. Just order a whole size down!"
4,laces don't stay tied,"Shoe is fine,but the laces won't stay tied,... I had to stitch them so they would stay tied..."
4,Comfortable Mocs!,I had been looking for a pair of moccasin's for awhile. I wear a size 11 so finding shoes of any kind in stores is a bit of a challenge. I saw these on Amazon and was hesitant to order shoes without trying them on first but I went ahead and ordered.Later that week I received them and they actually fit! I wore them the first time for hours and there wa no breaking in period at all. Very comfortable. I do wear thin socks as I found they were a little too snug with my usual white sport type socks.
2,where is customer service?,"Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. She doesn't love them and we want to exchange. Unfortunately, we accidentally discarded the box. Customer service will not respond to our inquiry about if we can return or not. So, we haven't been able to do anything yet and it's been nearly a month."
1,This shoe lacks quality,"I bought this shoe four months ago. I paid fifty dollars for them, but they did not prove to be worth the money. Unfortunately, after two months the interior bottom started detaching itself from the rest of the shoe; this makes wearing them very uncomfortable. Also, the shoelaces come undone every fifth step, so extensive walking is out of the picture if you don't want to be highly inconvenienced. Overall, the shoe did not meet my basic expectations, and was utterly overpriced for the quality."
2,Felt old ladish...,"I returned this - I just couldn't get over the feeling that I looked like an old lady wearing these... They were ok comfortable, but not over the top comfortable where I could have gotten over the fact they didn't look good on me. If they felt more like a supportive slipper, I probably would have kept them."
5,Great shoe!,"I love my new moccasins, they are perfect for winter time because of the heat they give your feet! I have very cold feet all the time so they help me warm up. I do have one complaint and it's because of the ties, they tend to become untied when you walk so you have to be careful not to trip on them."
3,Not as wide as I need.,"Not bad, but I would have ordered extra wide if I had tried it on first. Comfy and cute, but they also kind of look like they'll fall apart soon.Normally I wear 8.5 or 9 in wide brands like Dansko, but ordered 8C/D to keep it from slipping off my heels. I thought I was just slightly wide, but I this brand I'm probably more like an 8 E."
1,If you want to burn your sinuses....,"This stuff BURNS !!! After using it, I felt as though I inhaled peppers. Well, check out the only active ingredient on google; Capsicum annuum. This IS a pepper plant. Despite the burn, the relief it provides is minimal."
1,Stay away from this stuff!,"If ""0"" stars had been an option, I'd have given it. I bought this product to clear up chronic nasal congestion so I could dive without being dependent on stuff like Sudafedrine which makes me hyper. Everything folks wrote about the burning is true. But what was MUCH WORSE for me is that I could NOT stop sneezing (and I mean ALL day) or breathe through my nose for almost 3 months after discontinuing it - and I only used for about a week. The sad part is that I mistakenly thought I had developed a new allergy. Ha! I probably had zero functioning nasal mucosa left!"
1,Not good for me,"Used this spray this morning. It didn't open up my nasal passages, in fact it got worse. Also Made me nauseous. I feel a lot worse now. maybe this homeopathic medicine is not for everyone."
5,Love Sinus Buster,"Wonderful product, has finally taken care of sinus problems that have plagued me for years. Now even have my daughters taking this product and they too have finally found relief of severe congestion, has made their sports activities better handled now that they have conquered their constant sinus headaches and congestion."
1,mixed reviews.,Well a large percentage have given 1 star terrible ratings and a lot have given great 5 star reviews. Either A. Lots of the good reviews are fakes or B. The people that are addicted to afrin/ oxymetazoline or those that have rhinitis medicamentosa are trying this and expecting it to work like afrin or cure their condition but are in fact not helped because the rebound effect of RM is causing there sinuses to swell shut and that it is not actually the fault of the capseicin not working. Does anyone who doesn't use the chemical sprays get relief from this product? Maybe. But the ones that have existing conditions shouldn't expect this to work like their existing drug does or cure the issues caused by other medications. I'd like to see some more conclusive reviews but I am leaning toward this product being a gimmick and not actually providing serious relieve to normal stuffiness. And that there might be a lot of sham positive reviews.
4,This really helps!,"I have suffered from severe sinus headaches for 30 years and this is the first over the counter product that actually provides some instant relief. It does not totally make the headache go away, but with all except the most severe of them, Sinus Buster takes the pain from being something I can't stop thinking about to a background nuisance. It subsides the pain enough that I am able to resume activities such as working with much better concentration since I am not distracted by the pain. I would recommend this to anyone with sinus problems."
5,great!,"by not having this dvd..YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOSING!!This is AMUST HAVE CHER tour on DVD! on the official site there was this 3 words that took me by storm..(SAVE THE MAGIC)this ain't another tour dvd..THIS IS THE FAREWELL TOUR!I know that there is hollywood stars,pop stars,celebs..and there is CHER!i really loved this dvd..and i wish i could give it 10/100000!"
5,CHER (AT HER BEST),"I must say i have the vhs version but there is no comparison, the quality is much better and the sound is awesome, Cher has outdone herself this dvd rocks, were going to miss her I hope she decides to come back and do something else, I know as well as other die hard Cher fans she will be missed I Love Cher, she is one hard act to follow classy lady, get this dvd you ll love it much much better that vhs better picture quality and sound, Randall from Pikeville Kentucky"
4,Cher is great.,Saw Cher in Vegas and wanted capture the memory. This DVD is very much the same as the Vegas show. Lots of fun. Misses the energy of seeing her live at Caesars but if you could can that no one would go to a concert.
5,The best Apple fruit pies,The Drakes by Hostess Apple Fruit Pies are the best. My husband eats one every night and now we cannot find them. Please bring them back. Thank You Gin
1,Speaker Phone Problems,"Serious problem. The volume buttons do not function properly. In the middle of a conference call on speakerphone, the volume goes straight to it highest settting. Pushing the down volume button doesn't do anything. The reset option also does not work. However, sometimes it does work. I find that that this happens many many times. I really liked this phone until this unreliable feature is one. SO dissapointed, as I bought it for the speakerphone. May be a result of not using batteries as hinted at in the previous reviews. I am taking my phone back today. Can't anyone make a quality product anymore? This is ridiculuous."
1,Not user friendly for troubleshooting,"My power cord has gone out within one month of getting the phone. It now eats up 1 battery every 2 days. It won't ring or the buttons don't work unless it has power. I am having to send it back. I personally wouldn't buy this phone, but unfortunately, my corporate office did."
5,Amazing,"The influence of the ideas of western feminism combined with Islamic principals is described eloquently in this book. The rich history of veiling, Islam and colonization are thoroughly described. It is complete as well as exciting to read."
2,Y-U-C-K is all I need to say....,"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! They are awful, uncomfortable, easily breakable, and overall CHEAP. Never again."
5,Ultimate garden-planning book,"For anyone planning a garden of any size, this is the ultimate garden book. Plants of all types are categorized by size and the book is arranged so that plants can be ""visualized"" as they would look in your actual yard. A must-have for anyone interested in adding plants/trees to their yard."
2,Brother not happy with watch,"SKAGEN MEN'S DUAL TIME WATCH ALL-SILVER 281LSSI purchased this for my Brother for his birthday. When he received the package, he didn't know who it was from or why he was receiving it. He returned it because he said it wasn't his style, and he ordered watch that was more to his liking."
2,Good looking watch,"This watch itself is a very good look casual dress watch.The only problem is that in the description from Amazon didn't mention about the battery life.On Skagen official website has clearly mention all Quartz watch has 3 year battery life.So in my case is when this watch arrived with only top dial has movement, the bottom one a has not movement at all.In this case I return it the same day. And request a replacement.Skagen Men's 281LSS Dual-Time Mesh Watch"
5,I Love this Potty!,"I read numerous reviews and customer opinions on the various potties out there and decided to purchase this one. I have been more than satisfied. I'm an avid horsewoman and have it in my trailer so that I can use the ""facilities"" before tacking up and riding out and when I return. I just finished cleaning it for the first time and it was very easy to empty, clean and set back up. I have had no issues with this product and highly recommend it to anyone needing a portable potty."
3,"Great, but not long lasting","I love this watch! It's the perfect weight for my wrist, has the date and a backlight for seeing it at night. It's simplicity at it's best. The only thing about it is that it does not last! I was replacing the battery every 1-2 months for a year. I finally replaced the watch and this one is doing the same thing. I have never found such a simple, high quality material watch that I liked so much, but I would not pay the $45 I was told it would cost or even the $37 it's listed for on amazon, unless the watch is going to last a couple of years. So sad, because I'll have to find a new watch, it costs too much to buy a new battery every month. =("
4,still working,bought this watch awhile ago and it is still working. The only pain in the neck is trying to fix the date every month we don't have 31 days. You are supposed to be able to pull the little pin out a little bit to change only the date but I haven't managed to find the correct spot. My husband can do it though so that's good enough for me.
1,I bought two-and neither worked!,"This was really a disappoinment because I love the look of this watch, and it seems so well-made. The first one started running sporadically after about a month and a half, then, it died. I'd had the battery tested, and it was fine. Amazon told me it was too late to return it but that I should contact Timex. That was two months ago and I still haven't heard back. I liked the watch so much that I decided to try another one, and the second only worked a couple of days before doing the same thing. Well, that one did go back to Amazon in time. If I thought I'd have any better luck, I'd try for one more because it really is a pretty piece."
2,Heavy,"I bought this watch and its nice, but a little heavy. I think this is because it was not built with the latest technology."
5,"Wear this watch everywhere, great for college student who takes the bus",RELIABLE - WATERPROOF - STURDY- DOESN'T SCRATCH - BRIGHT INDIGO - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.... I don't miss the bus to campus anymore!
3,Beat after about 500 miles,Started to wear and move around after about 500 miles of trail riding. Switched to ODI lock grips which will hopefully last longer.
1,Just awful,"Portentious, overblown, slow, pretentious and deathly dull. I must be missing something, because I can't see any merits to this dinosaur of an album"
4,A classic of British Rock!,"Back in the mid 1970s, the launch of ""Crime of the Century"" was a question for Rock music fans. Another ""Progressive"" group? An alternative answer to Symphonic Rock? Together with ingenious lyrics and the use of keyboards, sax and even harmonica, this British band issued a series of successful albums.The first one to consider, obviously, is this ""Crime of the Century"". To be noticed: first CD reissues captured the mid-to-low sound quality of the LP version. Luckily, people at A&M;/Universal Music decided to reissue a remastered version. No extra tracks, no additional features, but the sound quality has been improved.If you want to remind the best times of Rock music (the 70s), get this album, as well as ""Breakfast in America"" and ""Even In The Quietest Moments""."
5,BUY THIS BOX SET NOW!!!,"Dubbed, subbed, makes no difference... a great series from Xebec, licensed and treated with care by ADV. Buy it now!"
3,Bad presentation of great criticisms.,"the authors way of presenting competing ideologies in dialogue by embodying them in ""real"" people was cute for the first few pages, but then grew tired reeeallly quick. the characters became shallow and predictable, and little more than distractions from the ideologies they were supposed to be holding, and led away from what could have been more involved discussion of the ideas themselves, which were what the book was supposed to be about to begin with. Maybe if he'd dispensed with the whole plot idea, and used the characters as simple props, with no story lines or relationships, and just led you through the issues, I would have given it the 5 stars it deserves, but the manner in which it was written hampers its arguement."
5,Gary Newman,"I saw a fan sub of this about three years ago and fell totally in love with it. Ever since, I have been longing to get hold of a copy of this (which is possibly one of my favourite animes), and now my prayers have been answered in the form of the realease of this DVD.This has to be one of the wackiest anime titles I have ever seen. The basis of the story follows the tale of a half-human, half-dragon girl on her quest to look more human. She falls for a handsom pop-singer who also happens to be a dragon slayer...If you love SD (super deformed) anime you will LOVE this.... The anime characters spontaneously switch from normal to SD when you least expect it. This anime is a total wack job...hillarious stuff."
2,BORING,"We watched this movie for a movie discussion group we are in, and thought with the director and stars in it, it would be good, but we were really bored. Just too many long scenes of the girl De Niro falls for, long drawn-out scenes of her face (yawnnnnn)."
2,boring,"This movie had lots of great actors,should have been a good story but bottom line it was a bore!I wish it had been better as it was written as about Irving Thalberg"
3,Tomorrowland,"TALES OF TOMORROW was the televison predecessor of such anthologies as ""One Step Beyond,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits."" Many of this show's stories were based on classic fiction while other scripts were written by some of the best names in mid-20th Century fantasy/sci-fi. The four season #1 episodes here originally aired on ABC-TV, Fridays at 9:30 p.m.For an excellent sampling of another science fiction TV predecessor of Twilight Zone, check out VERY BEST OF ONE STEP BEYOND. This box set offers dozens of supernatural stories at a bargain price..Parenthetical episode numbers, titles, original airdates and cast members are included below.(#39) Appointment on Mars (6/27/52) - Leslie Nielson/William Redfield/Robert Keith Jr.(.#9) The Crystal Egg (10/12/51) - Thomas Mitchell/Edgar Stehli/Josephine Brown(#16) Frankenstein (1/18/52) - John Newland/Lon Chaney, Jr./Mary Alice Moore(#43) Ice from Space (8/8/52) - Edmon Ryan/Raymond Bailey/Michael Gorrin/Paul Newman (in support)"
5,The road to Italy has been opened,"Concise easy to read guide. Organized by the different regions of Italy. Included are itineraries, maps and most importantly the ""sidebars"" which are shaded areas of a page with hints and facts that other guide books don't offer. Also a included are blank pages for travel notes. Agreat value for the money."
2,Some good Some bad,The book is somewhat boring but it does provide some insight into the sheltered life of an upper-class urban male. The book may provide a confidence boost to male readers considering the undoubtable feminine nature of the seemingly straight main character Melvany who's biggest fear is getting a used band-aid stuck to his foot at a pool.
5,We are never tried beyond what we can bear.,"Refresh your mind and spirit by laughing, crying, sighing and becoming entirely lost in this book. Arnold tells a captivating story of a young woman who, like most of us, didn't make all the right choices. But, all things work together for good to them that love the Lord and are called according to his purpose."
5,How Christian Fiction Should Be Written,"I think this book was published in 1946, but don't let the age fool you. The author presents the story in a much more real way than many of the modern Christian writers do today. In many of the contemporary Christian novels, the characters are either so perfect that they don't seem real or so have very filthy minds. A good Christian novel is one that is somewhere in between.Francena H. Arnold, in Not My Will, keeps it real and presents characters with real problems that only God can solve. Contemporary Christian authors should follow her example in the novels they write. Parts of it are sad, but it is well worth reading.You may also consider readingSearching for Mom, which isn't nearly as bleak, but it is a more recent book that explores the will of God in the family relationship."
2,Steve Austin,This video is the same thing that aired on A&E. It is not really good. They talk about how Austin got paralyzed and how he got the name Stone Cold.
3,"A bit technical, but I'm still reading","I truly loved ""Eleven Days"" so much that I bought ""Known Dead"" the very next day after finishing Harstad's first book. Only 1/4 through the book, I find it to be a bit disappointing after the first chapter. A lot of rhetoric and technical gun talk. For 80 pages I've been waiting for something to happen..."
5,translation for missionaries,"This is a very interesting book, and the author is a well-educated person, trained in anthropology and linguistics. As the child of missionaries, he lived in India, the Philippines, and later in Papua New Guinea. His ""translator's toolbox,"" the practical part of this book, would be useful for any field researcher. However, sections such as ""the impact of sin"" reveal a complete lack of self-examination as to why ""receptor cultures"" should have ancient Middle Eastern taboos and mythology foisted upon them. Missionaries are a culture that deserve to be studied by anthropologists. Grad thesis, anyone?"
1,I see two bottles! (on Amazon),I always thought that Slide-o-Mix was a 2-bottle deal. I clicked on the product that showed two bottles and I received one bottle. Am I a dummy or is that a badly listed product? I really need to read all of the fine print.
2,JUST A MANICURE,"Jeff Sutton (Richard Wyler)shows up in Rio with a suitcase with 10 million stolen dollars. The money is wanted by both a crime boss (George Sanders) and by Sumitra (Shirley Eaton)who is building a female army by kidnapping wealthy people and taking this money. These are your typical female army with exposed legs and a woman's usual 24 inch waist.In one scene Jeff brings a gun to a knife fight, but then uses his fist. The film also has prisoners in glass cages, women being tortured, brief girl/girl action, and the worse soundtrack I have heard in a long time. There was a background buzz for much of the film, plus the music was horrible with terrible lyrics. The pink phone with the long extension cord that can be dragged through a swimming pool was funny. The film has a fair amount of camp value. Also known as ""Rio 70"" and ""Future Women.""Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Sex, nudity (Maria Rohm, Beni Cardoso)"
4,T.C. Fry has written a very eye-opening book.,"If you think you know the cause of disease, then think again. T.C. Fry's ""The Great AIDS Hoax,"" is one of the most eye-opening works I have ever read. It's not just about AIDS, but the cause of all disease, which will make you think twice the next time you think you can catch a cold or the flu. Even sexually-transmitted diseases don't escape Fry's logic, which is right up there with the greatest of scientific minds."
3,Technically Sound,"Great features, but the display is hard to read unless you are direcly over the watch at zero angle. The field to the left of the hour display often displays other numbers at slight angles. I have had many watches(SuUNTO, Oregon Scientific, Bulova, Casio, nIKE) and none have aver done this. Im sure when I contact SUUNTO they will help me out. Just got the watch and havent had time. If it wasnt for that it would be TOP rated. So I will give it 3 stars....for now."
5,A real joy for lovers of fashion and history,I have always loved hats! Susan Langley has put together a wonderful selection of gorgeous vintage hats and put them in their historical and fashion context. A wonderful treat.
5,Major bang for your buck,Upgrade several servers with these processors. Amazingly fast and they run cool. Was an AMD fan but these Quad-core processors put me back on the Intel team.
4,ok video,"I liked ""Since you didn't feel like showing up"" much better. I didn't care for the sound quality, it wasn't mastered that well."
1,Disappointed,*Quality of an early 80s cartoon*Male frontal cartoon nudity (seriously....multiple times)*For the price you only get three 5-7min cartoons*Won't ever buy a Scholastic again
4,"Funny, Bitchy, Poignant...",....everything a good Queen loves to be! :) LOL While the book is definitely a fun read...also check out the author's BLIND ITEMS. A much funnier piece not as soaked with sex as this book is.
2,Hmm. Really don't know about this one.,"This book has a very promising plot, but what would have been a unique, insightful view of relationships (romantic and otherwise, gay and otherwise)is really undermined by humor that falls short of its mark--and not to mention an annoyingly self-satisfied main character, who goes through the entire story learning absolutely nothing from his experiences. Isn't change what fiction is all about? It doesn't happen here; no one undergoes even a smidge of self-discovery. If anything, the only thing that changes is the living arrangements. What's the moral then? That gay men are sex-starved and one-dimensional? How bleak."
4,Don't harp on it,"Many of the great Andrew Lloyd Webber songs are here, including ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" and ""Jesus Christ, Superstar."" My friend Peter Puller the Pasta Chef and Bartender Extraordinaire loves to do his own versions of these hit tunes, such as ""Don't Cry for Me, Semolina,"" ""The Fandom of the Okra,"" and ""Jesus Christ, at the Bar."" There was certainly something special about Webber, and there is no better way to appreciate his special genius than getting a little plucky with a harp."
5,Reliving past games,This is a great collection of the ten best games played by the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lots of action and excitement. Excellent packaging.
5,all-doingwatch,Very well constructed watch. Recommended for anyone in the military or who enjoys outdoor activities.
1,Watch not as advertised,"I have ordered this watch twice. Each time the wrong watch was sent. The basic silver model was sent in the black military box. Amazon would only refund purchase and not send the correct black military watch as ordered. DO NOT ORDER THIS WATCH ASSUMING YOU WILL GET THE BLACK MILITARY MODEL...The used watch price of $225 was the selling point for me to buy this watch. Amazon has done nothing to correct this issue and still advertises the black military model for the $225. YOU WILL NOT GET IT and have to waste time arguing with customer service...I am an Amazon Prime member and have experienced good service until dealing with this watch...If I could give negative star rating, I would still be pushing shift 8."
5,Suunto x lander,This is a great product and I am very happy with it. Previously had Swiss watch and had many problems then switched to suunto and it is the best watch I ever had. Thank you Suunto!
3,Good as an introduction,"I happened to buy this book amongst others as I have an interest in the history of Japanese swordsmanship and Iai.I found this book helpful in terms of history, sword-testing and nomenclature; though I found the drawings a big 'sketchy' at best. For reading purposes this is a good book, with plenty to keep it interesting... but if you want to know more on the practical side of the art of drawing the blade I'd suggest ""Flashing Steel"" by Shimabukuro instead. It uses photographs in illustrating points and offers better descriptions in its' instruction."
3,Very helpful and informative,"I have all of Shihan Craig's books, except for 1 that was out of print before I started reading his works. He is a uniquely qualified and highly regarded martial arts instructor and historian. I found this to book to be quite helpful. I bought it before starting Iaido when I just wanted to read his books. Now that I train in Iaido I use it as a reference."
3,Indigestion,"I got the Move Free about a week ago. I started taking 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening, but decided to take two in the morning and two in the evening. It does seem to help my range of movement, but I've had severe indigestion for two days now, and I think it's from the Move Free. I'm going to cut back to 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening again and see if the indigestion eases."
1,Coincidence?,I have lower back pain due to a disc disorder so I decided to try this product to see if it helped. Granted I only used it for a little over a week but in that time I developed diarrhea and far WORSE joint pain. Not only did my lower back ache even worse but I also developed pain in my hips and knees. I don't know it it was caused by this product or not but it seemed like quite a coincidence so I quit taking it immediately. Being as I just quit taking it I don't know yet if my pain will subside.
1,Flush mechanism very poor.,This was our first portable potty purchase. We gave it a water-only test run and are very disappointed. The flush mechanism only works if the water tank is very full and even then delivers just a trickle of water. We tried contacting the manufacturer at their web address only to have the email returned as undeliverable. We are returning this product.
5,Got this to give as a gift,"Loved the samples I heard at amazon. I'm excited for my friend to listen to it. It seems intact, so I don't believe my friend will have any issues with it."
2,Robbie the Reindeer (Hooves of Fire/The Ledgend of the Lost Tribe),Not real thrilled with this movie. My husband & I have been a great fan of Wallace & Gromit for years. Our 3-year old is also a great fan of Wallace & Gromit. This is a definate adult R rated film and not for children. Kind of slow and very disappointing.
5,President Carter's book on Palestine,One is able to get another point of view which is not the one provided by the U.S. Government of supporting Israel right or wrong. We need to challenge the way any country treats its citizens that claims to be a democracy and does not abide by its principles. President Carter has the credientials to challenge the attitude held by people in power who would back Israel even when it is wrong. It would be interesting to see a book written of the USS LIberty incident.
3,Carter is not Telling the Whole Truth!,"As much as president Carter tried to tell the truth, he was not telling the whole truth! What's happening in Palestine is much worse than what he described. Cultivated lands are being confiscated for ""security reasons"", homes with sometimes two or three families living in (because many families have been forced to leave theirs and live with other families) were demolished for having one member fight the occupation and many, many atrocities happening in the holly land that CNN and Fox prefer not to give five seconds to cover while giving primetime coverage to a police chase of a car. Still, I highly recommend this book."
1,A book full of lies by a failed president,"Nobody is mentioning the fact that the Carter foundation has been receiving millions from Saudi Arabia, and Jimmy admitted that he put millions in his private bank account. He had to do something to please his Saudi benefactors, hence this book. This book has been critisized extensively and there is little to add. Something not widely known is that as an ex president Carter has traveled all over the world for many years and always to the worst dictatorships, to kiss the asses of the worst murderers since the Nazis. And of course, he is an anti Semite, you just have to read between his lines. But he is also very stupid, if he thinks that he could discredit Israel and get away with it. The Jews are not weak any more, and when the time comes, they'll get rid of this miserable commie traitor and the other anti semite cowards."
1,From the man who helped Khomeini into power by doublecrossing the Shah...,and now wants to bring the same trouble to Israel. His coffers full of Arab money. And they talk about an Israeli Lobby???!!!
5,Excellent book!,"Former President Jimmy Carter gives us an excellent perspective on the conflict in the Middle East, using his experience in politics and his visits to the occupied territories. This book shows us that Israel is an apartheid state, no matter what the Israeli and American media try to say. The Israel lobby has already been exposed and many Americans are realizing that occupation will never bring justice.This book is also a very easy and short read."
1,This Book is a Mess!,"Jimmy, who once dined in restaurants that were ""white only"" and did nothing in Georgia to change the ""apartheid"" during his lifetime, is now an ""expert"" on the middle east? I think Mr. Carter needs to return to ""Israel 101"" as he does not even have his facts correct. This man, wrote a book and is so beligerant about the questions on his sources that he refuses to respond. This is a work of a man who clarly is in cahoots with the radical Islamofacists and this is not a book that should be consider worthy of praise. In fact, it should be filed in the ""fiction"" section of the library."
4,Good overview of Arab-Israeli relations,Gives a good overview of Arab-Israeli relations since 1948 with an emphasis crucial barriers to peace. The first book written by a prominent figure to focus on the suffering of the Palestinians.
1,For the mentally supine and amoral individual.,"Carter has outdone himself yet again. With another rubbish book of his ultra-left wing amoral and factually void drivel Carter continues to solidify his legacy of being America's worst President. I wonder if Carter would do a work on the Zabaleen Coptic Christians that live as cattle in Egypt. I'm actually very sorry I purchased this book for a quarter at the local book fair. Well, cheaper then a roll of toilet paper. Should any wish worthy works on the subject I'd suggest ""Bible and Sword"" by Barbarah Tuchmann, ""From Time Immemorial"" by Joan Peters or ""Israel Under International Law"" by Howard Grief. On entirely related subjects I'd suggest the works by Bat Ye'or, Robert Spencer, Andrew Bostom, Ibn Warraq and Sam Solomon. Happy reading..."
4,PEACE NOT APARTHEID BY JIMMY CARTER,"President Jimmy Carter has come down to realize that Israel is the guilty party in the making of Palestine. Unfortunately this is too little and too late because Israel has provided a favorable arena to the Muslim extremists,who are a small minority.Israel has helped in grooming these Muslim extremists by constantly providing a reason to fight and take revenge.This blood bath of the 20th and 21st century is another form of biblical crusade.Again,USA is fighting a proxy war for Israel and I think most Americans including Jimmy Carter have come to realize the truth."
1,palestine peace not apartheid,"what's happened to the past president, & peanut farmer. just reveiw the dancing in the streets by palestinians as they watched the twin towers falling....they want to make us united states of islam, and peanut farmers like jimmy carter become a tool for the jihadist to manipulate..this book has so many false statements and claims, i'm shocked he found a publisher...it certainly will be a best seller in the arab world. they say death to america, and good old jimmy says they have been misunderstood!!!!"
3,Poor quality CD production,"When I received my order, I discovered a major flaw in the middle of the very first CD of this 5 CD set. I tried the disc in 3 different players and had the same problem with each playing. I returned the disk to AMAZON - this system is relatively painless, but took about a week. The new disc set has FLAWS ON EVERY DISC. These flaws were not as serious as the first set I got, but I had to replay several passages to make out the words. This was inconvenient and detracted from my experience. I have not returned the second set, because I'm convinced from the number of flaws on the discs that this entire production lot is simply poor quality and it's not worth the aggrevation of returning these to get yet another defective (maybe even more defective) set of CDs."
5,Thank you Mr. President,"What Jimmy Carter could not do as a president because of all the obstacles of politics and lobbying in Washington, he is accomplishing it now. My hat's off to him. The history will not forget the oppression and the injustice that were done to Palestinians and US complicity to that. Thank you Mr. President for writing this book and to have the courage to go against the popular misconception about Israel (which is perpetrated by media and powerful Israeli lobby)."
2,misleading and factually insufficient,"I feel duped by Mr. Carter's elder statesman status. After I researched the ""facts"" cited in his book to support his opinions and found them lacking, I then searched for the reason behind his switch from the assertations he made as president. Should I be surprised to find that the Saudis contribute millions to his habitat for humanity program. He is the CEO of the organization. Therefore, some of the funds find their way into his pocket. He should have revealed his close financial ties to the Saudis in the introduction or preface of his book. Shame on me! It is also very dry reading. Don't waste your money. I would have given this only one star, because it is so misleading. However, either Jimmy or his assistant on this book can write a clear sentence from time to time."
1,Bad book with inaccuracies...,"It is truly sad to see a former President of the US take such a one-sided approach... he only presents one side of a terribly complex situation and in doing so, creates more harm than good. It is one thing to criticize one side of the situation, it is another to simply ignore facts or present them erroneously... this book is unfortunately rubbish from a President that I once admired... at least to a certain extent."
1,Great if it works,My sub died shortly after the warranty was over. I Email JBL and they offer to replace my unit with a newer unit called an E250P for $248.64 (accommodation price). No Thanks
1,Screwed by JBL Crap!!!!,"This is not a group I wanted to join, but I too have this crap for crap subwoofer and it too has blown up, two years after purchase. Playing along with a quiet song and ""BOOM!!!"", monster feedback,noise, etc. Reading the other reviews is not encouraging, but I will get on JBL's case.Deplorable quality. Class action suit is indeed indicated.NEVER BUY JBL AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER, NEVER, NEVER!!!!!!!!"
2,Loved it while it lasted,"While it worked this is an awesome sub. I had it for a little over 4 years, and was very pleased with the sound quality and deep rich bass. It has all the controls you could ask for, and fills a large room easily. It is a large unit so if space is a concern, look elsewhere.Had I written this review a year ago, I would have nothing but praise for this unit. Sadly, over the last year I started experiencing issues with it. It would randomly turn itself on and off, as if the sensing unit had failed. Then it started making random pops. Now, while it powers on, it produces no sound at all. There are no local service centers, and JBL customer support is almost non existent. I paid $250 for this product new. It appears it will cost me close to that to have it serviced.I guess it's time to look for a new sub :("
4,PMD's Solo Comeback,"So, PMD is obviously a rap music pioneer. The first four EPMD albums are amazing, some of my all time favorite rap music. They broke up, and Parrish released the sonic equivalent of a shwag blunt full of seeds: Shade Business. In 1996, no one was checking for PMD. He dropped this album, and I remember being the only kid in my high school to own it. And I loved it. I started rocking Tims and a fisherman hat right after copping this joint. This is a consistent, dark, rugged hip hop album. If you miss the days of 40s and blunts, tims and hoodies, this album's for you!"
2,What a BOMB!,"This book is a HUGE disappointment. The characters were totally unbelievable. The horses were more real than the people. I kept waiting for it to get better and before I knew it...I was done. LAME ending. Don't waste your precious reading time with this one. IF you liked Jane Smiley's Thousand Acres, you will hate Barn Blind. YUK!"
1,"Haynes Dodge Plymouth Chrysler Mini-Vans 1984-1995: Caravan,","This book is the biggest nothing as far as being helpful in repairing something I've ever seen. We wanted a how-to book and the only thing this book tells you how-to do is ""take it to a professional""! I know how to do that without having to have a book tell me! Don't waste your money!"
1,Come see Maynard SELL OUT!,"Total crap. Suitable only for those that dont want to keep any respect for APC or Maynard. Appears to be written for pre-teen boys that do not know that they can see real porn on the web for free. The whole DVD is just like the Outsider video, bad. I was hoping to see some concert footage or at least 5.1 sound of APC videos. Nope. Just Bikini Bandit tripe."
3,short on parallels to Austen,"The book club members decide that they want to focus on only Jane Austen, because anything following would be a disappointment, and this is. I found the parallels between the Austen books and the characters to be so shallow, I wasn't always sure what they were.If you want to read about characters in parallel with Jane Austen novels, I recommend Bridget Jones's Diary with Pride and Prejudice or Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason with Persuasion. Although there are some distinct differences between the books of Jane Austen and Helen Fielding, there are many parallels, and Helen Fielding is funny."
4,Does this give you an appetite for Jane Austen's books?,"If this gives you an appetite for reading Jane Austen's own books, then here's a good-value edition that you might want to look at - its ISBN number is:0954840119(put this into the Amazon search box and the book will come up).Also a good gift for someone who liked The Jane Austen Book Club."
2,not great,"It says on the back that you don't have to have read any Austen but I would disagree.It's all pretty cheesy, the storyline is uninteresting and the characters are fairly one dimensional - I wouldn't recommend it."
3,A lovely read,"This book was lots of fun to read. It was quick and quirky at times and looked into the lives of women and how they respond to each other on a social basis. It was much like attending a Jane Austin book club, reading other people's ideas of a shared passion. Enjoyable and fluffy."
1,The Jane Austen Book Club: A Novel,"Boring and disappointing, I forced my self to read it since I spent the money on the book. The plot and the characters were just boring-who would publish this book and will they give me my money back?? One star is one too many."
1,disappointing,"Disappointing read with flat characters. Stories go nowhere. The book lacked depth. Although the concept was good, the story lines were not fully explored and characters were not developed. After being in a book club for over 5 years, we feel that Fowler's story doesn't begin to touch on the interconnections of book club members and to the similarities members feel with the characters they read."
2,How deep is it?,I was not thrilled with this book. I thought the characers were shallow and kept hoping to find a little depth. The ending did pull it all together but it appeared to be just a quick way to end a muddle.
3,Mildly entertaining. Fizzles out.,"I started out really enjoying this book. The author begins in a tone that resembles Austen's quick, wit and backhanded compliments of the main characters. I enjoyed Jocelyn's story. As the book continues, however, the style changes to one which, while not unpleasant, cannot withstand the book's weak plot and/or the thin mini-stories of each progressively less interesting character. I have never read Karen Fowler, but I assume the style is hers. I love Jane Austen. I enjoyed the in-jokes, and even liked reading the pages of criticism in the end. But when I finished the book, I found myself shrugging. The characters may have been realistically portrayed, but I only cared about one or two of them. I finished it merely to see how Fowler executed the Austen element in each of the character's lives. I guess whether or not you like the novel depends on how much tolerance you have for these annoying people, and the humdrum stories Fowler chooses to tell about them."
3,How did this book get such rave reviews?,The Jane Austen Book Club (the novel) is about the life and times of the small group of women and the single man who decide to have a monthly book club regarding... Jane Austin's novels.It is a short-lived book club. Austin didn't write that many novels.Most of the members seem to think that Jane Austen cannot be surpassed as a novelist.That should be a warning.Picture the alternating of a discussion of Austen's various books with snippets of events from the members' lives.There... you've got the plot.I assume this was a more entertaining movie.
1,We were not amused!,"The premise was cute, a novel based on the lives of members of a Jane Austen bookclub. But the book itself is thin, with little plot and ordinary characters.Better to spend the time reading or re-reading the real and wonderful Jane Austen."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book because it seemed like a great concept. However, the concept wasn't well developed. There were also many writing errors in the book, and the book kept going back and forth from the characters pasts to a little bit about their meetings in the book club in the present. All in all, it was very disappointing, so much so that I didn't even finish it."
2,Don't bother,"Since I love Jane Austen books, I thought this would be similarly enjoyable. Sadly, it was not."
4,I wish I had known !,I wish I had known: there is a synopsis of Jane Austen's novels in the BACK of the book. I would have enjoyed it more!
1,Yawn :-0,"I wanted to like this book, but it just bored me to death. I kept reading and reading, hoping to find something that would make it interesting, unfortunately, that something never came."
2,Was There A Point?,"I was unable to discover the point of this novel. As a Jane Austen fan, I was hoping for more discussion of the Austen novels. There were some interesting insights, which is keeping me from giving this book one star, but not enough. I didn't care about any of the characters or their stories, especially since their stories were so poorly told. I find it hard to believe that a film was produced out of this material. Don't waste your time with The Jane Austen Book Club, read Persuasion or Pride and Prejudice, again, instead."
1,What is the point of this book?,"A friend gave me her copy of THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB, saying that she found it unreadable but that, since I loved the writing of Jane Austen, I probably would enjoy it.I didn't enjoy it. I hated it.What was the point of this book? It's not about Jane Austen, and it's barely about the members of this so-called ""Book Club.""The characters hardly are developed and, in consequence, there is no way that they can engage a reader.These characters rarely interact with one another and their backstories, insofar as these are revealed, are boring.I find it difficult to believe those people who claim to admire this book, thinking that their claims are some sort of pseudo-intellectual version of the ""Emperor's New Clothes.""As far as I can see, the choice of this title totally exploits the excellent reputation of Jane Austen, an author who no longer is around to defend herself."
1,Very unsatisfying,"I read this with my book club. As Austen lovers, we all had high hopes for the book, but they were dashed by the end of the first chapter....and it went downhill from there. The characters are dull and unsympathetic, the writing poor (one never does find out from whose perspective it's written-- it seems to change without notice), and we kept waiting for the Austen parallels which never materialized. Very disappointing book. If you're looking for a good read, choose The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon instead."
1,"Hook, line, and sinker","Yes, I too was lured in by the many sterling reveiws on the cover of this book. The old adage of not judging a book by its cover holds true for this one. The premise was promising: the book club meeting to discuss each of Jane Austen's six books. The development of the characters was so thin; they were almost like vapor. To me, the author seemed to have this great idea and then didn't follow through. In the hands of someone else this could have been a meaningful book. I finished the book, not because I wanted to, but on principle. I will be disinclined to read anything else by this author."
2,At least it got me to read Austen,"The best I can say about this book is that it got me to read Jane Austen. Karen Fowler can write well, but this story falls flat and goes nowhere. It is a kind of chick lit light. Even readers who like this book admit it lacks a plot, and I'll add that it lacks any likable, interesting, or understandable characters. We get snippets of background on each of the six members of the book club, but that doesn't help our understanding of their present circumstances or behavior. All of the discussions of Austen's books are superficial - the discussion questions at the back, as bad as they are, are better than anything in the story. Fowler also makes a strange tie-in to science fiction, presumably because she is also a science fiction writer? All of the characters are confused about life and love, but not in an interesting and insightful way. If Fowler was trying to write a modern parody of a generic Jane Austen book, then I would say it is too generic."
4,Entertaining and educational,"I've only read one Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice, but I enjoyed this book even so. The characters are well drawn, and develop in interesting ways over the course of the novel. I could tell that Fowler was doing clever, interesting things in her story, in homage to the Austen novels. I did not feel alienated by not being familiar with the source novels. Instead, it made me want to seek them out."
1,Drab,"I adore Jane Austen and was more than willing to try to enjoy this book if only for that reason (though I read a wide range of fiction and non-fiction). Right from the start I was irritated because the author described a Rhodesian ridgeback barking mere feet away from where the club members were in discussion. As the owner of a ridgeback, I know that absolutely nobody can talk or hear a thing while it barks. But that complaint is slight compared with the utter banality of the shallow storyline and the tedious characters. I only regret going to the trouble and expense of buying a hardback copy. If I could I'd award this book no stars."
4,You must be a Jane Austen fan!,"For all this is a well written book, the real joy of reading this lies in the subtle parallel's between each of the members of the book club with Jane Austen's 6 novels. If you haven't read Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense & Sensibility, Persuasion, Pride & Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey, you will be missing many of the references. Fowler does a very good job at using the Austen novels as a framework without developing the plots into modern copies of the original. She does not pretend to duplicate Austen's style and I think you would be disappointed if she did.It is a good book and an easy read. Well done."
4,One of the best post-Evangelion mecha series,"Dozens of mecha-featured series followed in the wake of Neon Genesis Evangelion. They were a mixed bag, to be sure. You had utter garbage like Brain-Powered and decent but unoriginal fare like Blue Gender.But you also had Gasaraki. Gasaraki was my favourite of the mecha series immediately post-Eva because of its seriousness, its complexity and its realism. No squealing kawaii heroines, no slapstick comedy, no animal sidekicks. Probably because of its subject matter, which was greatly informed by Japanese culture and geopolitics. Mecha were presented as realistic engines of war, and despite their skill and effectiveness, even mecha pilots could be lost in the currents of political and corporate intrigue. It was a convoluted mess at times, but overall was a good example of highbrow seinen anime all too often lacking among the swarm of shjo and shnen series."
5,waking up the West,"After watching ""Swimming to Cambodia"" Spalding Gray said one line that I'll paraphrase, ""Maybe there's this great cloud of evil that floats over the planet and randomly lands somewhere every so often."" Well, from Cambodia to Rwanda, that about sums it up because there is really no other explanation for the horrors of the genocide that occurred there. Feargal Keane has written a superb account of his journey into Rwanda shortly after the 1994 genocide. It's a well-balanced look at both sides with Keane able to access both Hutu and Tutsi areas (albeit sometimes with great difficulty and not a little danger). The human face of the ""war"" so often missed by Western journalists is really brought to the fore by Keane's insightful and extremely compassionate account."
4,"""Like an enticing fruit salad""","""Bryant ... offers a novel filled with characters you'll swear you know. ... ""Solitary Hearts"" reflects the author's own innate sense of compassion. Though some sections are far too sweet to satisfy the Grinches among us, this work of love will appeal to most caretakers as well as to those they tend."" This is a quote from a review by Sandra Redding, Published May 12, 2002 by the News & Record, Greensboro, NC."
1,Worst CD ever,"k these guys i heard were pretty good so i went and bought the cd from a local media play, worst mistake of my life to buy this. I would not even pay $1 for this cd. The lead singers voice never changes pitch when singing, every song sounds the excact same, and his scream is the worst scream in the entire world. Then the guitar players sound like they wanted to make a band one day so they just went and learned the guitar and they just suck. Not good music, not good guitar, not good voice, not good anything."
5,Godspeed this band to #1,"Just like Johnny Terror when I bought this I was like what the heck? So i put it away for awhile. Then I brought it out again for a listen. Then after a couple more listens i was hooked. The songs work well together. I love the comfy feel.And the song structure as everyone says is just plain awesome. Even through the chaos every thing falls in line perfectly. The no chorus part was the reason why I didnt like it to begin with. After listening I ended up love it cept it takes a lot to remember all the lyrics in the cd.If you want one of the best new hardcore acts cd, you best get on now before you get called a mainstream poser."
2,Second Quality,"The knives in this set are great. However, they arrived with the finish on the wood all over the knives, and several of the handles aren't fit well. The block has so much glue in the slots that the steak knives won't all go into the block, and the block arrived scratched and dented all over. Is Amazon selling factory seconds??"
5,GOTTA OWN THIS ONE!,My son and daughter (3 and 2) absolutely love this video. And moms and dads: you'll be going off to work with the catchy tune in your head - perhaps sing out a note here and there. We just recently got the book too. Highly recommended.
3,Not John Blaze!,"Yo, this album has some tight production by DJ Premier! But, the lyrics and choppy flow provided by M.O.P. just don't cut it. At times throughtout the cd, it seems like they yell and mumble words together. And what's really annoying is how the group echoes every sentence after a member rocked verse on the mic. However, they do represent the hardcore thug image with their guns and slugs. Overall, i recommend that you borrow this cd from someone first, before you make the same mistake i did of buying it. Peace!"
2,Not what their second album is,"About 4 years ago when I bought this cd, I could not wait to throw it in my cd player. But after listening to the whole thing, I lost it, and never wanted to see it again. The lyrics and flow that M.O.P. offered was not the problem. It was the production. Besides ""Stick To Ya Gunz"" every production is terrible, leaving the cd to be terrible. But now M.O.P. second LP ""Warriorz"" is out, and it's a thousand times better, Primo made up for his crummy production and M.O.P. got out of their freshman slump."
5,Excellent must buy !M.O.P best album!,You must buy it now don`t waste time! It has good lyrics and good basslines! Trust me don`t waste time to look for what you want!The one u want it`s here!
4,searchin 4 peace and a fan base,PH never got that fan base.unfortunatly they never caught on.whats weired though is the fact i herd searchin 4 peace months befor the album droped.either way the album version sounds better then the mo'thugs version.the problem with rap labels is that there artists are horribly marketed.this was a great solid album.it looks like we won't see these mo'thug artists again.

3,"Good, but not that good.","The author Diane Dreher tells the reader how they should apply the Tao (Tao Te Ching) to their everyday lives, and provides little exercises for how to accomplish this. It is presented in kind of a ""wake up and spell the roses"" flavor about your personal attributes. Personally, I don't like to give bad reviews to any author, and the book was not that bad, it just wasn't written in an interesting way. There was sections of the book which I really liked, but there was a lot of bore too. My philosophy is to just get ""it"" from the source, The Tao Te Ching."
4,a way to Peace...,"I couldn't disagree more with the ""serious student"" review. The serious student can simply read the original Tao Te Ching. This book makes the Tao, the Way, accessible to people who otherwise might never get the message at all and I consider that serious! It's very relaxing and certainly does create a way to peace. Keep in mind it was written over twenty years ago, so yes, it sounds ""new age-ish."" But, as I just wrote on my blog, if I was marooned on an island, this is a book I would like to have with me. That says a lot, from someone who has a houseful of books! Important, profound literature does nothing if it can't help us calm down and enjoy life. Lighten up and give it a try! It's been part of my collection of Taoist books for years, and I think it's a delightful, inspirational little gem."
2,SO-SO,"To put it bluntly the worst songs ever made by ABBA are in this album but since this album has 12 songs to choose from there are still hints of future success of the group. At the time known as Agnetha Bjorn Benny And Frida the group messed around with different techniques to find the perfect sound for the group. Although not found in this album there are a few songs such as :RING RING , ANOTHER TOWN ANOTHER TRAIN AND NINA PRETTY BALLERINA show that this rookie group could go far if they worked more on their melody. This is a reasonable beginning but not too flash. Definately not a very good ABBA album but still they were only just starting out and the albums after that pretty much showed how well they could be. Die hard fans will love it but the rest of us stick to greatest hits albums to get the better of the songs on this album."
3,Underrated; you can already hear movement towards greatness.,"While hardly a masterpiece in the league of the great, late albums, 'Ring Ring' is a vast improvement on patchy albums like 'Waterloo'. The grotesque prog-rock indulgences that marred that work are largely absent; the one exception, 'I Saw it in the mirror' is redeemed by sad lyrics and moving backing vocals.By this tage of their career, Abba had yet to find their true voice, so 'Ring Ring' largely comprises some excellent pastiches (eg the Carole King of 'Disillusion'; the Animals of 'She's My Kind of Girl').Full of exhiliratingly tuneful dance pop, the Abba aesthetic can be glimpsed in the frothy stomp/melancholic subject matter of the title song; the haunting 'Another town, another train' reminiscent of the astonishing late ballads; and 'Nina, pretty ballerina', an early stab at what would become their euphoric masterpiece, 'Dancing Queen'."
4,Quality filters,"Quality name brand Filtrete, not some off brand make. I like having multiple filters so I'm not constantly ordering."
4,Quality of transfer?,"The first ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" is truly a classic, combining old school horror with an eerie poetry like the original ""King Kong"". Admittedly, I disliked part two, which sacrificed the poetry for mere action, and didn't even bother to watch part 3.Can anybody comment on the transfer of the first film in this collection? I found the old single DVD of ""Creature"" rather weak. Has the film been remastered for this edition, or is it the same transfer?"
1,"lackluster, tedious and infantile","The Creature from the Black Lagoon is a lackluster, tedious and infantile film filled with ham actors who smoke, curse and fight each other in each scene, attempting to portray some sort of sophisticated 'drama'. Most of the characters are so inept they can't even shoot straight. The 'scenes' of the Amazon jungle are repeated over and over on some man made studio back lot. I was rooting for the Creature all the way.I could go on, but basically, these films are an insult to intelligence and have been hyped up by teen pranksters who saw them at the theater in the 50's/60's and have been following every Creature feature convention for the last 45 years.They try to drown out any sort of criticism. Avoid the Creature from the Black Lagoon Legacy Collection (Creature from the Black Lagoon / Revenge of the Creature / The Creature Walks Among Us)."
1,I'm waiting my CD,I'm waiting this CDI hope receive it until 2010Best regardsCarlos LimaJB40: 40th Anniversary Collection
1,Eye of the Storm,I ordered this product way over a month ago and never did receive it. I have emailed the sellar several times with absolutely no response. So I don't know how good this product is.
1,died in less than 4 months,This was the perfect entertainer for a 12 hour vacation drive for my 5 yr old daughter. I even enjoyed playing it. Unfortunately it started eating batteries and died even with trying another new set of batteries and then an ac adapter with no revival. I bought this on QVC for $20 so $50 for less than 4 months of play isn't worth it.
4,Great for Electronic Devices!,"These add an hour or more to the playtime of your electronic devices, but do not help mechanical devices with motors and things. I don't understand how they work, but on my Rio 500 they give me 2-3 hours more playtime. They are a very good buy for all digital things such as camera flashes and mp3 players, but are not worth the money in older discmans and other highly motorized devices. They more circuts the better. This is also known by the name Titanium and is virtually identical to Duracell Ultra Batteries."
1,all about the new ira,"it amazes me how people can write books who really don't have a grasp on all of the information they write about! He at one point is advising people on which investments to put in their ira but gives a lot of misinformation. First of all, fixed annuities have no front end sales charge at all which differs from the ""cheaper"" investments he refers to that can cost as much as 5% of your entire assets to invest in. As for hidden fees , I think mutual fund companies have that down pat between the annual management fees and transaction commisiions! Secondly, he is speaking only in terms of what those funds were making at that time and not what someone can expect on average. How do you like Janus worldwide now, my friend!"
4,A good and clearly written book on the different IRAs,"This is a wonderful book the that clearly explains the different available retirement plans. While the descriptions seemed detailed, I would like to see a later volume that explains any changes in the new Roth legislation. A great book for those struggling with options."
2,Fright Night,"This Album is not what i expected it to be. It's an OK album, compared to FIGHT NIGHT 2004..."
4,A must have for any web site project manager.,"This book provides a project methodology and substantive advice regarding usability and design. The coverage of the considerations involved in creating a large scale web site is thorough. Most of the advice is very solid.Minor drawbacks are that the design suggestions are warped by a grid ethos, apparently brought about by a too-early exposure to Quark Express.Another drawback is the constant droning regarding the wonderfulness of Netscape Navigator. This is somewhat understandable as the author is an employee of Netscape. The biased browser information is a little out of date.<P"
3,what the others say it is,"this watch does what the other reviewers say. BUT, don't get it wet. i had mine replaced for $75 after an online complaint to the company. the watch fell into 5 feet of water and was trashed by the water leak. i like the compass, barometer the best. the trend line is helpful on the weather forcasting. the temperature is only good if you take the watch off and leave it on the ground.besides the compass, it functions the best if you leave it in one place and refer to it daily at your tent...not all that convenient, eh?"
4,Great shoe,I got these and loved them right away. The putty color goes with everything. They definitely weren't made for extended hours of walking but they're comfortable for short periods of time. Loved them so much once the black was back in stock in my size I got them too. The only problem I have is the sole of my foot hurts after long wears.
3,Ultimate Route 66..... I'd say not!,"I expected better things from Michael Wallis than this mish-mash of disjointed bits from along the mother road. I'm certainly glad that I didn't pay more for this set because it simply didn't have the ""goods"". There is another 5-disc DVD set available which is a far better resource for anyone wanting to drive the old road. Disc 1 is okay, but disc 2 is a 30 minute waste of time and really a disappointment. Disc 3 included a visit to an ""Exotic Dance Museum"" which I felt was inappropriate and not even part of the old road. While I appreciated the updates on ""favorite"" road sights, there weren't enough of them. Far too much of Wallis' ramblings about some lost or forgotten spots. I'm more interested in what to expect if I traveled today. I have traveled most of the route over my lifetime and feel this was a waste of money and time."
4,route 66,I recently was with a team of 8 on a missions project out in AZ. We visited sites along Route 66 and it was very nostalgic and I remember the TV show Route 66. I enjoyed watching this and want to share with my team mates too.
5,A Perfect Fit,I've been a fan of Kenzie shoes forever & am sad to see they're getting harder & harder to find. These shoes are cute & very versatile. I found the size true to fit. My niece named her daughter Kenzie & these shoes made the perfect present!
3,Somewhat off target...,This attack on Amtrak seems to ignore the comparison to how much of the taxpayers' money is spent on supporting a money losing airline industry as well as an interstate highway system abused by trucks that are HEAVILY subsisidzed by the federal government. The amount of money lost per person is much less with Amtrak than any other public transportation means.
5,Thumtacks Barbed Wire And A Whole Lot Of Blood,"Me and my friend saw this pay per view and it ruled, the tag team table match saw each team take great risks to try and win including balcony dives, powerbombs, ladder dives,and other crazy moves,and the street fight oh man there was barbed wire boards, thumtacks, and chairshots the price is a little high but I would buy it"
4,great ppv,"well, it could have been a bit better but overall it was a great ppv. the cactus jack,hhh match was great. the rumble itself could have used a little work but still a buyable movie"
4,29 men 1 woman 1 winner,Kurt Angle vs Tazz 3/5 First ever tag team table match:Hardys vs Dudleys 5/5 First ever miss rumble swimsuit compatition:5/5 Tag Team Championship Match:Acolytes vs New Age Outlaws 2/5 Intercontinental Championship Match:Hardcore Holly vs Chyna vs Chris Jericho 3/5 Street fight For the wwf championship: HHH vs Cactus Jack 5/5 Royal Rumble:5/5
3,"a good ppv ruined by one person, one old person","The 2000 wwf Royal Rumble could have been one of the best ppv's ever. With the unbelievably brutal street fight for the wwf championship between cactus and HHH. The Royal Rumble was also great. But they would have been much more enjoyable, if Mae Young hadn't come out and did what she did. Who could enjoy a good match after that!? The WWF went a little overboard with that one. But at least your able to enjoy the dudleyz and Hardyz in a table match. If it wasn't for Mae Young, this would have been a five star ppv."
3,Not Bad,"It's ok, but it's not really as ""for dummies"" as you might think. Not neccessarily for beginners."
5,Very Nice Selection,"If you are looking for a good set of routines that are short enough to be able to do when you have time in the day, this is a nice selection of workouts that target different parts of your bdy, arms, legs etc, it provides a nice workout.Highly recommended."
3,Great selection - poor sound quality,"I bought this off the ebay and thought maybe I had been hoodwinked into purchasing some crappy BMG record club selection or something. Closer examination reveals that this was released in 1995 which means that it missed out on a proper re-mastering. The hissing sound is very audible in the background and just drives me crazy. This super-group deserves a new re-master, 2004 style. Otherwise, most all the Cream a normal person needs."
4,"Excellent for newbies, but a little disappointing.","I really loved the original of the series, but I was a little disappointed with the re-make. If you are a true fan of the original, then you may cringe at the changes made to the characters. Especially, the fact that they made Linna so wimpy and that Mackie, (Sylia's perverted brother) was nowhere to be seen. The music on the re-make was pumpin', but I thought that the music on the original was better. Priss also had a better personality on the original series. Other than that, if you haven't seen the original, then I would recommend this DVD, for the animation quality is great, but if you truly loved the original, then be warned that this is not a sequel (although it would have made a good prequel) and that you may be in for a surprise."
2,"Baby Deluxe Assortment(32804) Edible Hard Sugar Decorations, 24 pcs","They are great looking and good decoration for baby shower. But unfortunately after I received the package, I found some are broken."
1,I got lost!!,"I am a beginner. I tried to follow this book and got lost.The explanations about the images sometimes did not illustrate the concepts. The focus shifted to something else. It was hard for me to find the linkage.I like books written by Frank Webb, Al Stine and Charles Sovek. There are all very easy to understand and I can learn pretty fast by reading those books. Try one yourself if you are a beginner."
5,A scifi novel to make all fans proud,"I have read all the Wing Commander novels even the horrible ones written for the movie, which in and of itself was a horror, and I believe this is the best book of the series. Yet, I wonder of all the books why this won hasn't been reprinted? None of the other books in the series are as complening and captivating as this book.Without giving to much away, the plot seems to be a combination of the World War Two Dolittle Raid, and the Battle of Midway and like the US Naval the Confed fleet is outnumbered, out gunned, and the Kilrathi like the Japanese are winning the war, but out numbered and stretched to the limit the humans in the ConFederation have to take an all or nothing through of the dice on a plan that has almost no chance of success. Read the Book and Find out if the Confederation hits the heart of the Kilrathi, their homeworld, or we lose? Find the book, the answers will surprise you, the cost will be high, and don't stop reading to the end."
5,Brilliant,"If you are a fan of electronic music, this album is essential. Cevin Key has always been an innovative producer, from Skinny Puppy through all his various side & solo projects. This album reminds me most of Doubting Thomas ""The Infidel"", perhaps my favorite Skinny Puppy side project. Lush instrumentals, great use of samples, dramatic song structure, it's all here. While I believe most of these tracks were written well over a decade ago, they sound like they could just as easily have been written yesterday. I can't even single out any tracks as highlights, because this album is great, front to back."
4,Savannah's first piano,"Savannah is 8 months old. I think the FP baby grand was her favorite Christmas toy. She was able to easily push the keys, turn the ""page"" and generally ""play"" the piano. I believe it will grow with her. The three functions increase in difficulty as she ages. A really great piano."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I originally had this piano as a hand me down and it had several problems so thinking it was just because it was used I decided to buy a new one. The new one showed up with all the same problems, whithen a few weeks, it went from great to total crap- the keys started shorting out and not playing the songs or the words. Now it has gone to static sounds or nothing at all- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,F-P Grand Piano,Purchased as a gift for my Grand Nieces (twins). They love this thing and were about to drive their mom crazy with it until she finally found out how to turn the volume down.
2,Would've loved the toy...if it hadn't been broken the 2 times I ordered it!,I ordered this toy twice from Target and both times it didn't work properly. I'm not sure if this toy if other people have had this problem or not. I wouldn't reccommend buying it from Target. They have awful customer service and were very unfriendly when dealing with the returns. Maybe I'll try buying it from somewhere else and see if I can get one that works.
5,Outstanding!,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this toy. I bought it for her about two months ago, she was 10-months-old. She just turned one and it remains one of her favorite toys. When she gets up in the morning or comes home from being out the first thing she does is go play her piano. She dances, laughs and play with EVERYTHING on the toy. I'm very pleased with it. I also have enjoyed playing with it a little, showing her the keys and different things to do. Well worth the buy."
4,The baby loves it but the music is awful!,"Our 8-month-old LOVES this crazy piano, she laughs and smiles when she even just sees it, and she loves to play with it and chew on it.BUT - why did fisher-price have to make the music so outrageously bad?! Nursery rhymes are actually quite nice, so why turn them into really bad off-broadway schmaltz that makes parents want to prevent their babies from turning on the toy? Attention fisher-price: just stick with normal music, babies will still love it and it won't make parents' skin crawl."
2,"fantastic music, but NOT stereo","okay...this is supposed to be a part of the Stereo Action Series. In fact, it is one of the very first entries in that line of crazy stereo recordings. My old and worn LP is a lot of fun in stereo, but this CD release is the MONO version, thus defeating the purpose of even calling it a stereo action recording. While the musical arrangements are absolutely top notch, there is much less life in this mono version than in the stereo edition. Hopefully this will be rectified at some point in the future, but I doubt it. The rediscovery of cocktail music which led to its resurgent craze in the mid to late 90s has died down...too bad. I hope the stereo tape is not lost to the ages."
3,pieces with bad coating,"When we opened the package and tried to play for the first time we found a lot of small shiny pieces and fine dark colored particles on the board. They made the board somewhat messy. When I tried to clean each piece, I finally realized all these small shiny pieces and dard particles are result of coating coming off the magnetic portion at the bottom of each piece.This whole thing kind of makes me sick. We spent quite a bit time wiping all the pieces clean. I have to wonder all those residues are of health concerns too.Functionality wise it is good. Maybe we are just not lucky. But I have to consider this product inferior. It would be nice if game rules had come with the product."
4,"Well researched, very readable, Hard to put down.","I found this book to be a very interesting look at the life of an upper middle class woman, throughout the latter part of the eighteenth century. Mary Fish Silliman had a bittersweet existance and survived three husbands and several children and grandchildren. a very good read for research or pleasure"
4,A Great Supplement to a 1st year US History Course.,"The Way of Duty is a great supplementary reading for those taking a first course in US History or for those wanting to know about the life of an ordinary woman and her family during the time of the American Revolution and pre-Revolutionary times.This book has information about the First Great Awakening, and on the religious sermons that were preached during the Great Awakening. But this book tells a story about the life of Mary Fish Silliman, and the time (1736-1818) in which she lived. It's a good window to look out to see how a family functioned during the American Revolution."
5,Dennis Byrd is a stud,"this book kept me wanting more Dennis and Angela Byrd are truly inspirational people. I highly recomend this book to any one who has had any kind of setback in their life or career. Dennis never asked ""why me?"" when he paralyzed playing football. Dennis used faith in him self and God to rise above it."
5,Not your usual Italy trip!,"This book is a wonderful addition to your Italy travel library. It is not your usual list of high spots to see in well-known tourist locales. It has a wealth of unique and truly lovely places to visit with a special person or on your own. We just returned from a trip to Umbria, and found the book invaluable in locating outings, activities, eating, vistas, and wine-tasting that we may not have found otherwise. In addition, the villa where we stayed was found through resources in the book and it was exquisite! We felt that because of the book and the activities and places discussed, we enjoyed our trip at a deeper level and got a true sense of Italian sensibility and what Italians appreciate about their terrain, sunsets, and foods. Bravo, Ms Podesta!"
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this television in early 2005 and the picture went out a couple of months ago (May 07). I paid around $600 for it at Circuit City and from reading the reviews, I don't guess it will do any good to contact Panasonic and will not be worth the money to pay for it to be repaired. I have a Panasonic 40"" LCD Projection TV that has been working fine for 4 years but I will not purchase another Panasonic television ever again. Do not waste your money!!!!!"
1,Panasonic should get out of TV business,"As stated in so many of the previous reviews, picture went black on my Panasonic CT-27HL14 at 2 years. Actually I feel fortunate to even get that long after reading other people only got a year, or sometimes even less for TV in the over $500 category. I have to believe that Panasonic has lost alot of future business on this model and if it's any indication of their HD quality, you should stay clear of their TVs. Fortunately the 10 year old + Sharp tv that it replaced is still here and working well, so I can take my time making my next purchase but I can GUARANTY it will not be a Panasonic"
4,It Drew Me In,"While reading Different Flags I was drawn into the story. I actually felt that I was one of the members of the ""cast"" and that what was happening to Ani was also happening to me. It's an interesting novel, though not a perfect one."
4,Excellent Descriptions of Daily Argentinean Life,"I received Different Flags as a gift, and I had my reservations about enjoying it. After all, the author is relatively unknown. But, as I read, I found myself impressed with the way she describes daily life in Argentina and the protagonist's attitude towards her aunt. The lead characters ( Ani, her aunt and the priest) are well-developed, too. The language and the grammar used in this book is not always the language of someone born in the United States. It's not a novel for someone seeking something American. However, this fits the story well. Different Flags takes place in another country, where people and their habits are different. The Thornbirds is a more famous book, but I didn't count it against the author of this one at all."
3,Python 2.1 Bible,"The book does cover a lot of ground regarding Python and tool kits that are available.I found it a bit too advanced for someone just getting into the language, however if you already have some familiarity with the language it would help you expand your knowledge beyond the basics obtained with the initial download.It just covered to much ground to do the job completely and although I know it will become helpful in the future it was the wrong place for me to start."
4,Great concept,"Some great songs on this album, Mr. Roboto, Don't Let It End, Cold War. But also a few that don't make sense out of the context of the rock opera itself. I like it for the feel of listening to it straight through, but it does become a little disjointed when shuffled."
1,The Missing Link,"This is way beneath a 1 star rating. I listened to this album and my stomach was coming out, I was laughing so loud. I'm one who loves to listen to people trying to make good art, and watch them bomb it. The song Heavy Metal Poisoning makes me look like a good singer. The story behind it is laughable.One the up side, if you listen to this album, you will grow to love every other artist out there. It's that bad!!!"
2,I Was There...It Deserved To Be Trashed,"I had been listening to Styx for 6 years and had all of their releases when Kilroy came crashing through with Mr Roboto. I'm not putting anybody down for liking that song, but it and the majority of the rest had such a negative impact on the longtime fans. Mr Roboto in retrospect isn't *horrible*, it just isn't Styx if you know what I mean. Cold War is absolutely the worst Styx song of all time. I can't believe Tommy would write or allow such garbage. Don't Let It End is respectable. High Time is more garbage. Heavy Metal Poisoning and Double Life are the best 2 songs (written by JY of course). Just Get Through the Night is actually pretty decent. Haven't We Been Here Before might be acceptable if there weren't so many light songs already here. The real shame is they had the talent, proven guitar work and awesome drumming by John to avoid such a quick fall from grace."
4,One Of The Best 80 Albums,"I really barely knew Styx (Before Kilroy was here) I'm still not sure if it was there fisrt album, but for it's time a was a very cool pop-rock album, maybe one of the 80's best"
2,Big Break,"Poor Dennis tried to write for the there and the then, with disco. There was nothing wrong with their music before, and it's not like they were going poor. Don't Let it End was a nice ballad, and Tommy's Haven't we been here Before? was a slow relaxing track, but that just doesn't cut it. Double life was kind of funny in an interesting way, but that's it. The rest is just disco as a lame attempt to get popular. Maybe this was the reason Tommy left for Nugent and Spades. They were back on the trail in '99 with Brave New World, but from 83'-98', Styx was on a big break from music. Welcome back Styx!"
5,Spectacular Sci-fi Double Feature,"I bought these as on-topic fillers for my science classes because they are still timely and just plain fun to watch. The technology is funny to todays kids, but the stories really engage 'em and spur great discussion."
4,overly priced,"the cords seem to be ok, i won't install them untill spring, the only negative thing is they are way overly priced, but what isn't"
4,The American Lanza Was Great - That Is More Than Enough,"Why this ongoing nonsense about a this or that Caruso? Enrico Caruso was unquestionably great. He was also unique. This frenzy to tag other tenors as the German Caruso (Tauber, or some other German or Austrian? Nothing of the kind, but great enough in his own right); the Romanian Caruso (Schmidt - again, unique and a splendid artist); the Polish Caruso (Kiepura - terrific on film, if sometimes perhaps less so on records) - the list goes boringly on and on.Caruso was great and unique; and so, despite the stubborn or prejudiced or deaf or silly critics, was Lanza. They both left many wonderful recordings, and Lanza at least also was fortunate enough to live when good quality sound film technology was available, so thanks to technology we may enjoy his legacy perhaps even more than that of the great Neopolitan."
5,Pacific Drums Percussion 700 Series Straight Cymbal Stand review,"This is a good straigt cymbals stand for the $$$. Keep in mind that it does not extend that tall, if you need a tall stand. Check the dimensions before purchasing. The name brand of the stand is not as important and the quality of cymbal you are using. Even more important is the player playing the cymbal. Hope this helps!"
3,Cymbal stand,"after I set it up, I realized that it was a little bit too short, but it stands well and steady!"
4,Hilarious,How refreshing this comedian was when growing up and everytime i watch this DVD I am in tears laughing. Something every household should have and in your collection
5,Best of Pandolfi,By Request is by far the best of Padolfi. These selections are full of emotion. The clarity of the piano is to perfection as is Emiles' rendition of every song. This is one of my favorite musical selections in my collection.
5,Useful overview,If you haveHead First Design Patterns (Head First)this poster is great overview that you can stick on wall and stare at it from your computer table.
5,Great latin entertainment magazine!!!!!!!!!!,"Great latin entertainment magazine!!!!!!!!!! Makes a great gift!!!!! My Mom loved hers....My Mom is a latin gossip and entertainment enthusiast so I surprised her with this gift subscription and she was thrilled. Once again, thanks Amazon.com You're the best!!"
4,The magic is back,"Reunited for the All Tomorrows Parties event, this formation of Captain Beefhearts Magic Band amazes. John French, Gary Lucas, Denny Walley, and Mark Boston turn back the clock to the days of Trout Mask Madness (or look far ahead, depending on how you view Beefhearts music).French's drumming is as incredible as ever, and when he sings, well, he sounds real familar to a voice we all miss. This is a far better record than it should have been, and considering it was recorded at a very early rehersal, it's nothing short of amazing. The Magic Band. Ain't nobody even close."
5,"Funny, Lots of Info","TV Dot Com is a funny, info-packed book about the future of television and the history of television. The book traces the origins of today's TV features, such as the VCR, and takes the reader by the hand to the present and into the future. It's very insightful and fun to read. The author often uses humor to make his point and although there are only 128 pages, there is more info here than most 328 page books.The coolest part of the book is the Predictions sections. At the end of each chapter, the author offers 10 or so predictions on that topic. I agree with most of his predictions. And I can hardly wait for them to start. One of the most interesting forecasts is that the Video on Demand will replace the local video store.All in all, this is the best book about the television and the culture I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,"Good overview, easy to read and follow structure.",This is a good book for getting a good lay of the land. There is a death of books out there on this subject. I found the book to be laid out in easy to understand and read structure.
4,CLONES,"Replica is a book that is interesting. The books main character is Amey Cammblen she is one of seven clones. She gets poisoned and has to make a trip to the hospital. When in the hospital she is deathly sick, and she starts to go in to a dream. She dreams about an evil doctor that kidnaps her and all of her clones too!I was intrigued when I read the book because of the way that Marilyn Kaye describes the intense action and suspense like when the doctor chases Amey. This book is an exciting one that is good for any time when you have nothing to do or on a long trip. Replica was an interesting book about a real but fictional character. The book would be good for people who love to read no mater what age they are."
1,Just No Good,"I gave this book a star because I think that anytime an author is able to write, finish, and publish a novel, he or she should be commended, but that's about it.This novel had a lousy premise and was, in all respects, so incredibly silly that I only finished it because I hate putting books down in the middle.First, I think that the authors, who should not quit their day jobs, should really see a different editor. Second, I think that the author should really think hard about how to write a cliffhanger ending (as this book is clearly meant to be the first in a series), third, I think that the authors should stick to writing Star Wars novels.Don't read this book. I promise that if you are a thinking person, you will be sorry if you do."
3,easy to read but the examples are not sufficient.,"The book is used in my 2nd computer science course this term. I found the contents for each chapter are kind of messy, To best understand how those machines and lemmas work is to work out some examples in the text book. But the book is so stingy giving out readers examples. I also get another book as my 2nd reference book for this course. This book gives readers more examples and just-right explaination for each theoretical thingstitle: Automata and Formal Language author: Dean Kelley"
2,Not recommended,"This text gives a rigorous treatment of the the theory of computation however it simply lacks creative presentation. To put it in laymans terms, it is simply boring. I liken the reading of this text to having a root canal performed. I simply cannot believe how effective this text is at killing the excitment I got from reading on this subject the first time. As with any subject, if it is presented well, virtually anyone can ""get it"" provided a little thinking is applied. This book's authors cover the necessary subject matter but, in my opinion, simply do not teach it well and therefore do not inspire."
1,Not a very good introduction.,"I had the misfortune of having this book as the text for a course on Computational Theory. I had never been exposed to the subject material before and this book left me totally confused. The examples are shrouded in complex explanations that only left me filled with frustration. In my humble opinion, this book is not fit for an undergraduate course in computer science without some previous exposure. As another person commented, I also wonder wheter it was written for students or PhDs?"
1,Good books are understood by all.,"This book is good in the fact that it covers a lot of subject matter thoroughly. Unfortunately, many students, like myself, simply find this book to be boring in presentation. Personally, I think, how can someone not love this subject? It is incredibly interesting and its study answers so many questions relating to the possibilities and limitations of computers. However, this book does not keep students interested."
3,another challenging Melvins release...,when i heard 'the bloated pope' a few months ago i assumed that the whole cd would be rockin' melvins w/the requisite killer drums and guitar. it turns out that Lustmord has had a much heavier hand in the production of this album than the killer 'bloated pope' would make it appear. much of this album consists of 'ambient' noise and anyone looking for ONLY killer-rocking melvins stuff will be surprised. it's an eclectic release. it reminds me of 'honky': several killer metal tracks and lots of spooky weirdness on the other tracks. this cd would be best experienced in an altered state.
5,dark ambient meets L.S.D. grunge,"the title explains it all.some tracks take several minutes to churn into a recognizable melvins aura,and that's a very good thing!this is like the ""bootlicker"" album on ludes.if you like this one definatly check out the ambient works of robert rich and steve roach as well!the death cube k albums would also compliment this release well!"
5,very pleased,his is the first classical instruction book i ever had with a cd i had flamenco books with a cd guide to show how you are playing i am looking forward to many hours of fun playing and learning using this book.
5,"This ring is gorgeous. my friends are jealous of my new ""sparkly Diamond"" for christmas parties. I just grin and say thank you!!",All my friends are curious and jealous of my sparkly new christmas party ring!! I smile and say THANK YOU!!!I couldn't love it more if it was real diamonds And my friends think it is =)
1,wears out quickly and zipper breaks,I got this case and used it for transporting my laptop to and from school. It only took a few months for the zipper to break off as a result of the stiffness of the zipper. The zipper is stiff to zip and there is no ease about it. All four corners of the bag have holes from putting it in my backpack and constantly using it. I only used it about a year and a half and yes i used it with a broken zipper. It was still zippable because the metal piece that holds the handle of the zipper broke. I recommend this item if you are hardly going to use it but I definietly don't if you are going to use it everyday like I do or want something that will last a long time. I won't be purchasing another.
4,Does the job,"It's a simple sleeve to hold your notebook; I use this and a padded Tucano bag to protect the notebook; the only minor gripe is that it has ""grown hair"" in certain psrts as the material got scraped when taking the notebook in and out."
5,I love it,I have absolutely no regrets on the purchase of the Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress.I have had many restful nights on it.
3,"not bad, nothing special","I figured ""hey - it is deceptive advertising but it still may be a good mattress"". It's average and there are probably better ones in this price range. But it's better than nothing."
2,Not Firm enough,"I have purchased other memory foam toppers that were firmer than this one, that were lower in density. This one states that it is a 5.5, that is why I went with this specific one, also the great price. Its is nice and didn't get much of that chemical smell after I aired it out for 24 hours. I just expected this to give me a bit more support than I got."
2,Very basic introductory book,"I was a little disappointed with this book, it is a very basic introduction to mule deer hunting. I was hoping for something more in depth on the habits of these beasts and how to get them on the table. Almost a 'coffee table' book, not terribly informative."
3,"It was fine, but fragile","The watch looked fine and was exactly what I was expecting. I dropped it on a tile floor and the faceplate shattered. Of course, it was not advertised as drop proof and it was quite inexpensive, so I can't really criticize them but be forewarned if you are prone to dropping or bashing things about this watch may not be for you."
3,The Beginning Of The Slide,"After Fairport's first two albums, with their terrific blends of quality originals and traditional songs, this album feels like a letdown. I am surprised that it was voted ""Best British Folk album of all time"" by one magazine's readers. Yes, it is still somewhat enjoyable, and Sandy Denny's voice was as great as ever, but this is the beginning of a long slide for the band. They started delving more heavily into the Olde English traditional folk music, and come off the worse for wear, in my opinion. I actually prefer their original music, which was top-notch, and the Dylan covers. A disappointment, but I still hang on to my CD and put it on every once in a while for a change of pace."
4,"Beautiful, enjoyable, fair","Fairport Convention: Liege & Lief: It is always a joy to hear a Fairport Convention album. Their fine rendition of ""Tam Lin"" is the best cut here. The rest of the album is enjoyable and rates four stars."
4,Great Workout,I'm a big fan of Ellen's videos. They are challenging yet are very easy to follow. She has great cues. This gives you a great cardio workout as well as toning and sculpting. I like to get a new video once in a while to shake up my routine. This is a great video.
2,Disappointing Mix,"I bought this video recently, it is a disappointing mix of aerobics and pilates. I bought it for the pilates so I expected the pilates to constitute the main portion of the video...it wasn't!! The short session of pilates was the video's only saving grace.And what's up with the cutaways to the drummer when you are trying to follow the routine? The music is not the focal point of this video, the exercise should be. I recommend the Hilary Burnett's Matwork series for true pilates - it's excellent and challenging.JennB(Barbados)"
5,Perfect for new Momma's!,"I LOVE this workout! I bought it on New Years Day and have been addicted ever since and doing it everyday. Ellen is the best instructor that I've encountered yet. Her voice is not annoying and she motivates and gives clear instructions. I had never done pilates before this video, but she gave me a pretty good understanding of how to use my muscles and breathe. I saw results the first week, mainly my legs, arms and thighs. The squats are working magic. This workout is good for beginners and not too difficult to follow. Everytime I use the video I get better. I'm more limber, energized, my waist is shrinking and my abs are getting defined. I love Ellen and I recommend this video to all you Momma's trying to get back into shape that don't have time to go to the gym. Give it a try, stick with it, you will see results fast."
5,never get bored,"I have an entire collection of home workout tapes, including Denise Austin, TaeBo, Winsor Pilates, and various Crunch tapes. This is the only tape I use for my cardio workouts (I do strength training on my own with weights and a stabilty ball). I find that when I use this tape consistently, within three weeks, my problem areas (loose areas around my midsections, butt, and thighs) are almost non-existent. Ellen, the instructor, seems approachable and easy-going. The drummer is in no way distracting, but the music pumps you up and changes tempo with the moves in a very motivational manner (especially at the times when you need it the most!). This is a very low-impact cardio workout, but if you are looking for a strong pilates workout, I would suggest Stoutt and/or Windsor. But this tape definately gives you the cardio needed to stay in shape."
5,Great Advanced Pilates Workout,"This is a great workout for anyone who loves Pilates, but wants a more advanced workout with cardio elements. I've been doing Pilates for about 6 months, and I wanted to try something that focused on burning more calories and increasing my heartrate during the routine. Ellen's video did just that! The first time I tried the video, I couldn't make it through the whole routine, and I had to take a couple 30-second ""breathers,"" but it's definitely a great workout and you will notice changes in your body right away."
2,This is not pilates,This is more of an aerobic workout than pilates. The instructor continiously trys to convince you that you are doing pilates but really you are doing aerobics. There is a short pilates mat workout at the end that is good but the rest is not pilates. Don't waste your time.
3,Interesting...,"I bought this DVD because I am in the proceses of lossing weight. And I thought it would be great way to help burn off the fat. The whole ""Crunch"" Series has gotten great reviews. But I am not very flexable and doing the floor exercises were difficult. So I am going to work on my stretching and flexability and then do this DVD again and again. It is a great cardio at the beginning. But I am still going to get the rest of the DVD's in the series. I get bored so this will help me to be able to pick a workout for what ever mood I am in that day."
1,UCK... Not worth the money... CHEESY..,I have alot of dvd/fitness videos and this by far was returned before I opened it. I borrowed it from the library and after 3 minutes shut it off... The dvd had a good concept but I don't believe it was anything close to true 'pilates'... The outfits were CHEESY and just enough to cover the private parts etc.. the models in my opinion did not look really fit and the outfits did no justice... I was surprised of the poor production on this crunch dvd..usually I like their product... Don't waste your hard earned money on this one... I don't usually write reviews but had to step up on this one..
3,good for beginners,"This workout is fairly simple to follow but not very high-intensity. I am in pretty good shape so I barely broke a sweat doing it and the strength-training exercises at the end didn't include enough reps to make my muscles burn. However, some of the ab exercises were new to me and so I did more of them then the video does to get up to my level, which I would say is intermediate to advanced. If you're a beginner, this is a great video to buy. If you're advanced, you will probably want to look for something harder."
5,THE BEST EVER,"This is the best workout ever. There are two parts, cardio and mat, less than 5 minutes into the cardio you'll be sweating like a pig (girls of course, glow). It's a good long cardio section andthe mat work is HARD. I couldn't finish it all, the first few time. I would like to make it clear that you need NO EXTRA EQUIPMENT. You feel great after. You need this DVD! It's good for all skill levels."
3,Not Quite Pilates - MishMash,"I've never reviewed anything I bought before but I thought I'd point this out to folks who are interested in starting Pilates like I am. The Fat-Burning part was intriguing, and the dvd does this by putting an aerobics session in the program. There really isn't much pilates to it, it's aerobics. The next section was the pilates with mats, where she showed some basic pilates moves which are easy to follow.Personally, it felt like half and half of aerobics and pilates, which isn't necessary a bad thing, and the cardio workout isn't terrible. People focused on burning calories might find use for it, but people focused on pilates will probably be disappointed."
4,Great dvd,"It really gets your heart rate up with cardio before the pilates mat work out. I wish they focused a little more on the abs but you can really tell the difference in your lower body. I am so glad it doesn't have the cheesy music and faux-thong workout clothes. You can really tell this was made recently, not in the 80 or 90s."
4,5 stars if pilates workout was better,"I never tried any cardio-type workouts before I purchased this dvd. I never thought I would enjoy cardio, but it doesn't seem so bad in this workout. I really enjoy doing pilates but there wasn't much of a pilates workout on this dvd. There were good pilates priciples though.Also if your new to a cardio-based workout as I was, the steps can be a little confusing."
3,Not quite challenging enough,"If you like the style and feel of aerobic dance but want an easy pilates work out this is the one for you. It gave me a decent work out, but it wasn't as challenging as I would have liked. I think one would do better with doing a traditional pilates workout for sculpting along with traditional cardio, like walking for fat burning."
2,"Mediocre at best, and way too repetitive","Definitely an interesting idea for a video - cardio mixed in with Pilates work. But I have to say that the cardio section is pretty disappointing. I didn't feel that it did a good job of working different muscle groups. All of the movements were based around doing squats...over...and over again. I think my thighs got a good work out but I'm not sure about the rest of my body. And the movements in the cardio section were extremely repetitive - to the point where I completely lost interest and was just counting down until the end of the section.The (very) brief mat work portion of the video is better, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who hasn't done some pilates before, as the instructor doesn't give very detailed instructions during this part.I'll still bust out this video when I want a change in routine sometimes, but I'm always instantly reminded of why I don't like it. One of my least favorite crunch videos so far."
4,"$60 for Hereticus, I think not","For some odd reason, this book - a $6.95 paperback if purchased from The Black Library itself is being listed by sellers here for $40 and up! Do yourself a favor and just use the GW online store to order, after speaking with a GW sales representitive here in the US, the book is not in limited production, nor is it sold out."
4,Review of Behind the Scenes in the Lincoln Whitehouse,I think this is a very well written description of President and Mrs. Lincoln and their children also. This goes into their personal day to day living and thinking especially Mrs. Lincoln and Tad. This covers that aspect of their lives better than I have seen written anywhere else. CRC.
3,A Very Special Christmas,Bought to complete set. Buy to complete set or if you want to hear another artist's take on Christmas tunes.
4,Great Holiday Hits-But Beware---,"When this album first came out 13 yrs. ago, it had Bon Jovi singing the old Clarence Carter classic ""Back Door Santa"", later releases such as this one have substituted it with his old standby ""I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas"". Can anyone possibly explain why this was done? Bon Jovi's cover of that song is a rarity, while ""I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas"" can be found on a few other r&r Christmas collections. All in all, you can't beat this 1st of the A Very Special Christmas albums, with maybe 2 exceptions all the songs are terrific & you'll find yourself playing them every year around holiday time."
5,Read the book first!,"I probably would atually give this book a four star review, but I give it five just because I felt the need to countact the previous review, which comes from someone who not only obviously has not read the book, but apparently hasn't read the Bible either."
5,A wonderful find!,"HR Pufnstuf series is the collection-Magical island adventures and memorable for kids of all ages. Highest quality DVD production collection, featuring Billie Hayes, and starring BAFTA and Oscar nominated Jack Wild (Oliver!), who brings his character Jimmy to life so delightfully. This entire series is so playful,musical,and has so much color, vibrancy, and imagination brought to life by superb talents, it is irresistable. Perhaps quite modern and progressive for the day, it holds up brilliantly today, nearly 4 decades later, and never ceases to be entertaining. My memories of some of the characters had faded over the years, but marvelous to rediscover them again on this 3 dvd set. Highly recommend this H.R. Pufnstuf series, if simply for the sheer joy of the music, colors and characters, all from Living Island. And of course-a very great talent now lost to us prematurely-RIP Jack Wild."
4,Very good,Very good watch. Huge improvement over the chest-strap technology. My only complaint is that the finger sensors that read heart rate sometimes take two tries to read heart rate...but I have a similar problem with hard held heart rate monitors...maybe it's just me.I would buy the Mio again.
3,Watch This,"As a sports watch it does serve its purpose. It is small. I wear a 6.5 inch bracelet with room and this fits snugly on the third hole from the end with barely enough strap to put through the end tab. It does not always read my heart rate or takes so long that it isn't as accurate as I would like it to be during spin class. However, I need a watch and want one that can withstand sweat and abuse and not having to wear a chest strap which I can never find is a plus. If you need a monitor because of health issues or rely on a heart monitor extensively during your work-outs this is not the style for you."
2,Can't transfer video to computer,"Apparently this is a problem with many JVC cameras. It claims that you can upload video to your computer. However, there seem to be some issues with Windows not recognizing the camera. I have done numerous reads now on this through the internet (wish I had researched this area before buying the camera) and it is either a problem with the Win XP Service Pack 2, the IEEE1394 firewire (which JVC doesn't give a cable for this if you do decide to buy a firewire that will work with the JVCs) or the capture card, which does not seem to come with the camera, but they admit on a JVC site that it is needed. Why they haven't worked out these problems yet, I don't know. But if you google ""computer won't hook up to JVC camcorder"", you will find that it is a big issue with many JVC owners. I bought this camera specifically for the computer upload function, and it has failed. Thumbs down."
1,JVC should not sell any item like this again.,"Don't be expect about it.It is not the display that 1.33 mega pixel should show up and seems 3DNR(3D Noise Reduction) never work. you will feel like you are riding on an airplane. It sounds so motor cycle. I was about going to throw this camcorder when I played what I recorded. Bettery is available for only 65min but if you do rewind or playback like that kind of things, I don't know how long it's gonna be. Of course, you better don't think about still photo. -_-;"
2,Extremely Noisy - No Analog Digital Pass Through,I purchased this camera at [a retail store]. Got it home and made a short tape. The video quality is average. The worst thing however is the noise that is picked up by the microphone of the tape mechanism. It is Extremely loud and annoying. This was a deal breaker for me. And I dont consider myself too picky. The software that comes as part of the package is the bare minimum and I probably wouldnt use. I got a screaming deal on this camera and was really disapointed that I had to take it back - but the noise picked up by the mic is very noticeable. Not worth the money at any price.
1,JVC WILL RIP YOU OFF,"JVC recognise on their web site they have manufactured defective GR-D30U Digital Video cameras..mine is one of them..I sent it back for repair when my camera kept telling me to ""remove the lens cap""..when their repair center received it they called me wanting $250.00 to repair it. I sent a letter to the president of JVC. Still no satisfaction. DONT EVER BUY A JVC PRODUCT."
4,absolutely great CD.,"obviously the guy who reviewed the CD before I did doesn't now the first thing about good music.I first heard of the spirit that guides us when they released their debut 'the sand the barrier' and it completely rocked my socks off!then this one, the follow up. it had to grow on me, I have to admit. it's nothing like the debut. gone are the mogwai like soundscapes and the ?beragressive hardcore parts. but the spirit is capable of writing a good rock song, or a couple of them. nice singalong choruses and good melodies. I love the lyrics, and the way the guys sing.the only downside is the almost complete disappearance of the screaming part. I know he sounds like a maniac, but I love it."
4,"Very nice, but I believed these would be larger",These were nice but smaller than I had expected from description. Nice design though. I would recommend them for a remodel or update on a cabinet.
2,Disapointed In Bible.,"I recently purchased this bible for my 10 year old son. My husband and I both have life application bibles and love them. I'm sorry to say while there are some good attributes to this bible...overall I was disapointed. It is missing some key things: this is not a red letter bible therefore making it very difficult for a child to know when exactly Jesus is speaking, it's missing a dictonary & concordance in the back and most of all it's missing the one thing that's makes an application bible an application bible...it's missing ALL the explanations for verses etc at the bottom of the page! If you're just looking for a basic bible w/out red letter this would be perfect for you. But, if you are buying it thinking you're getting an actual life application bible I'm afraid you'll be greatly disapointed."
5,A great Bible for any kid!,"This Bible is arranged and translated in a way that will allowkids to study on their own or with family and friends. Also, with themany features of this Bible, kids will be able to read about certain people more in depth, apply Biblical principles in their lives, and start thinking about theological issues. This is a great Bible for any child, whether they have been raised in church or are just beginning."
5,Great to see a reprint now,"The only one I missed (because of moving to the Netherlands). Happy to see a reprint finally of this book. The series is complete now (until next issue arrives of course). Every annual has been worth it and this one's no exception, even after 12 years!"
5,The Wit and Wisdom of our Pop Culture Icons,"From law and order to sports and celebrities, They Said That! provides an entertaining look at ""the wit and wisdom of modern celebrity culture."" Engelmann's compilation of verbal slips and and insights from people like Dennis Rodman, Shirley Maclaine, Madonna, Monica Lewinsky, Bill Gates, Wayne Gretzky, and President Clinton will amuse and entertain you. Carefully researched and meticuloulsy organized, They Said That! is a pop-culture reference book and chronicle of our times. Guaranteed to make you laugh and ponder the absurdity of today's superstars."
2,defective,"I was really excited to get the Fisher-Price Amazing animals sing and go choo choo for my grandson. Now that he is old enough to enjoy it, I find out it doesn't move or play the songs. I bought it new from amazon but kept it for a gift. I am disappointed considering how well its rated and the cost."
1,Useless and annoying,We got this toy as a present for our daughter's 6-months birthday. She is turning 1 year now and still is not interested in this train. The music is too loud even on the low setting and the songs are just annoying. The animals are very heavy and hard to manipulate. Most of the animals don't have much range of motion (except the giraffe). I personally have hard time finding educational value for this toy - just a bright plastic noise-maker. I have never seen my daughter pick it for play from her toy collection.
3,"Loved the toy, but broke in 30 minutes by 23-month-old.","When we first opened the Animal Train, it crawled along on the low-to-medium height carpet just fine. Within 30 minutes, my 23-month-old boy apparently broke the train because it can now only pull on the lineoleum, otherwise, it will click (the gears) and not go anywhere if on the carpet. Couldn't find anything in the instructions as to 'DO NOT USE ON CARPET'.We still have fun with it, but are careful only to use it on the lineoleum (which there isn't a lot of it so we have to re-direct the train so we don't strip the gears)."
3,Nice Toy If It Worked,Unfortunately the toy never worked correctly and we bought it brand new. This item should be purchased at a retail location instead of through the mail for ease of returning if needed. It plays music fine but has never moved across the floor like it should. I'm a little disappointed about the quality but it's a cute toy and my one year old likes to push the smokestack to play the music and the animals are cute.
5,Still going after 2 years!!! Very durable!!!! Super cute too!!!,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas when she just over 1yr old and loved chasing it around Christmas morning. She has continued to play with it over the last 2 years and loves it!!! She now likes to put her babies/barbies in it and pretend they are going on a trip. She has thrown it, hit it, stood in it and just about anything a kid can do to abuse a toy and it still looks brand new! Now my 6 month old son giggles his head off when she drives it past him back and forth, he also loves to hold the animals and tries to suck on them. This toy is well worth $30 and even the $40 we paid for it when it first came out! I am willing to bet this toy will be popular in my house for at least the next 3yrs as my son starts to enjoy it more and more! This toy is also very good on batteries, I don't think I have changed the batteries in it more 3-4 times."
4,too small,"Thought it is bigger in the photo. The actual bag is really kinda small, it can probably only hold another laptop in the the other compartment other than the laptop compartment. It really is quite smaller than I expected it to be. Great value and great for the price too though."
5,Is North America getting this or what?,What in the hell is going on these days? Companies as of late sure do like to keep their customers waiting and waiting.. I have been waiting forever to see this and now the studio decides to not release it? WTF.. that sure is pathetic..
2,Translation is too literate and loses poetic power,"Having much admired Machado in different anthologies and translations (by Robert Bly) I was left very disappointed with this translation - it attempts to follow the Spanish too closely and loses a lot of poetic force. Some poems fall completely flat because of the unfortunate translation - in fact I barely recognized a poem I absoluely love: ""Rainbow at Night"" compare the Robert Bly translation with Alan Trueblood's if you ever get a chance and you'll know what I mean.On the other hand if you know Spanish this is a good volume."
5,Time to grow some teeth!,"Wonderful new album! This one starts off with more of an edge. A high energy album that shows off more of William Faith's talents. Monica Richards' vocals take on a harder edge, and the groups musical versitility shines through yet again. (""Compare Sredni Vashtar"" and ""In the Amber Room"") This album steps away from their familiar Medaeval and Early music themes for a bit and jumps full force into the 21st century's Techno/industrial world.Definately another triumph showing the groups talent as musicians."
4,"""Sauce for the Goose"" means his gander is cooked!","CHILLERS was a one-hour suspense anthology adapted from Patricia Highsmith's eerie short stories and hosted by Anthony Perkins. ""Sauce for the Goose"" is the second episode of that program. It stars Ian McShane, Gwen Taylor and Benjamin Whitrow.""Sauce for the Goose"" was previously used in the TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED television series.SYNOPSIS--Olivia is a widow made wealthy by orchestrating her husband's death. She remarries avaricious young Steven, who intends to continue alley catting about. He doesn't know however that the treacherous Olivia has far different plans for him.RELATED ITEM:Twelve episodes ofCHILLERS(including this one) are available in a fine quality 3-DVD set from Echo Bridge."
2,A Decent CD,"The reason we got this CD was for Toussaint McCall's ""Nothing Takes the Place of You"". Just this along song was worth getting this CD. Many of the other songs were ones I have never heard of; perhaps it is best for those who actually REMEMBER the 60's."
4,GOOD STUFF,"This book was assigned reading for a Hispanic culture class I'm taking. I read the English translation, and I actually kind of enjoyed it. Gallegos has written a very interesting commentary on life at that time in Venezuela. Santos was probably my favorite character, next to Dona Barbara, of course! I would recommend it to anybody who would be interested in learning more about ranch life in Venezuela or who just wants to read a good book."
1,Male fantasy,"I only finished this book because a good friend loaned it to me and I felt obliged to give it a try. It is the sort of book I should imagine some men drool over - a beautiful murderess constantly undressing and making love as he peeps through uncurtained windows, then she marries her victims and kills them. There is no real belief that one person could follow someone through life and never be spotted and never really lose his quarry. There is no engagement with the characters.Certainly would never read another book by this author. Relieved that I can go back to my satisfying Norwegian thrillers, my Donna Leon's, Michael Connelly et al."
1,Not So Great,I bought this fan in hopes of it move a good amount of air. I was really disappointed. When I used it with the A/C adapter it got so hot you could hardley pick it up. The fan itself moved very little air. It is so little if you hold it just inches from you you can barley feel the air. This is the worst fan ever. If its not on your lap when you use it forget it.
3,Good fan,"It works. It was a lifesaver while we were outside at a family function. You need to be near it to feel it, but its deffinatly worth the buy if you're going to be in the heat."
4,Lightweight. Great for a power outage.,It's a medium-powered fan; cools my bathroom but not strong enough for my bedroom. Quiet. Fair price.
5,"02-cool model 1044 10"" indoor/outdoor fan","We are really happy with our new 02 - Cool Model 1054 10"" Indoor/Outdoor fan. It is a wonderful fan"
4,Portable it is...,This fan is very portable. We've taken it camping and even to the office. The only concern is the big 4D batteries it requires. I've labeled our cord and put it in a plastic baggy to make sure we don't misplace it.
5,Great Case!,"This case is inexpensive and easily holds my gba, my gba worm-light, and a bunch of my gba games! It is worth the price and is light and easy to bring with you on trips!"
4,Timex Watch,This is a nice watch at an affordable price. My only complaint are the glow-in-the-dark strips on the hands. It makes the watch look somewhat cheap.
1,Memory totally broken,I have tested this memory in 2 different pc and it's not working at all...I lost all my money in this.
4,Kingston DDR 2100 Memory,Memory card slid right in to the available slot. Nothing else required. PC recognized it on first power-up. And nothing fried !!
2,For hard core fans only,"I'm a big fan of rock guitar instrumentals and many of the players on this disc, but aside from the Bourelly and Marino pieces it was really mediocre"
3,"Not bad, but you'll have to do it twice...","Giselle is cute, energetic, and clearly a good dancer herself, and I would bet her actual studio classes are a lot more interesting and complex. But on the DVD, her workout doesn't really get your heart rate up much--even if you add in bounces/jumps, etc. I tried doing each segment twice and that worked me out a little more (and got me up to ~60 minutes). This is still a fun workout and I'll keep doing it on days when I want a lighter session, but if you like Paula Abdul's 2 cardio dance workouts, then Crunch Cardio Salsa is going to fall a little short.(By the way-- on the plus side, I had no problems understanding her and I enjoyed the music/drummer.)"
2,Not if you want to sweat,I enjoyed the video and the smooth moves. However it does not qualify as a workout- too easy and you barely break a sweat.
5,Brighten Your Day - The Cardio Salsa Way,"This DVD's been a fantastic addition to our fitness program and we highly recommend it. To any couples out there needing a little exercise ""spice"" in your lives this is it. Giselle and her dance crew will inspire you, motivate you and teach you exciting salsa moves and rhythms. Neither of us were ""dancers"" but we stuck at it and the moves came with time. Do this work out with your partner. 35 minutes of sensual Salsa 2 to 3 times a week has been a wonderful tonic for our relationship, as it will be for yours!"
2,shrug,"This is an ok aerobic workout.You'll get your heartrate up.I don't really recommend it though.Here's why:- hard to take seriously. Which is ok, but I don't think they're trying to be funny, which makes me feel bad when I have to laugh.- music could be.. better.- girlfriend's feet move faster than a ferret on speed. Which is impressive, but hard to mimic. I take comfort in the fact that many of the backup dancers drop some of the steps too.- It's a pretty long workout. I usually have time for about a half an hour at best, and we're nowhere near the cooldown at that point.When I finally made it to the end of the video, though, the cooldown was a pleasant surprise. Very nice. Kind of relaxing."
3,"Ok, but not great","The music was great, however the instruction got in the way of dancing. You never got a good workout because she talked and instructed the entire video. I kept waiting for her to ""dance"" so I could get down to sweating."
5,Adventure movies are back,"One guy unknowingly joins organization that saves and protects the world from its legends, recipe for success or disaster. Thank goodness it is the latter. A movie about a librarian, you may say, sounds dull. Alas, this is no ordinary library. It houses all sorts of things from mystical artifacts to long forgotten books of magic. There are also regular books there. If you liked Indiana Jones or Jason Bourne then you will love this movie. It is a very easy going and action packed adventure from start to finish."
4,A Fun-Filled Romp!,"The first of the Librarian series of movies, I was a bit dubious when I first sat down to watch this when it came out. I shouldn't have been--it was fun, filled with adventure, and funny. Bob Newhart and Noah wyle are hilarious, and the other cast members do a fine job as well.Recommended."
3,Low budget film,The movie is entertaining but lacks the depth of a big production movie. I have seen better made for TV movies. This was the less entertaining of the three.
3,not what I expected,I did not like the fact that it has a foreign language on the cover-nowhere was I told that it was not printed in English- we have not seen it yet- it was purchased as a Christmas gift
4,Size!,"Seems like a great instructional book; just note that it is not full-size (as it says in the title) - the pages are only 6"" x 9""!"
5,Accurate Rendition,I like this film because it was well done and stayed true to the biblical book of Esther.
4,Esther,My wife and I enjoyed watching this movie. It was thought provoking and makes you want to go back and read the book of Esther.
3,Mostly well acted except...,"A faithful adaptation to scripture yet the movies portrayal of the king was terrible. He was presented as as a naive, stupid, irresponsible child that drank too much. This did not give Esther much credability for loving such a silly man."
3,Esther,I received the product quickly and in good condition but I did not like the artistic license.
2,Disappointing...,"Nothing against Redd Foxx, but this CD was definitely a letdown. The 'explicit lyrics' were no doubt explicit in 1950 but I was shocked at how tame the material was after hearing numerous times what a raunchy mouth Redd Foxx had. Maybe that was left off of this CD, I don't know. I might have chuckled at 5 tracks or so, but that was it. Also, many of the tracks were 5 seconds or less, just a quick one liner. I won't say it was a total waste of money, just probably not what you are expecting. Not what I was expecting anyway..."
5,Far and wide,"A book to dip into for useful world-wide facts and information no-one but a quiz addict needs. There are green and cultural tips, quotes, brain teasers, statistics, lists etc. A good bedside book."
2,ZOMBIE POODLE!!!!!!!!!! :),"The movie starts off when this fat chick has reaccuring dreams about these zombie children and some indian ritual. Then the movie goes on until her dreams become reality as 3 zombie children arise from a morgue and chase the living around. Then the zombie kids eat up an old lady and turns her into a giant zombie and they then have to battle a zombie poodle.A hit and miss film. Some parts in the movie are really cool and others make this movie seem to dumb. Gore was ok for a R rated film, story is rather dumb and no hot chicks in this film. Only worth a purchase if you wanna see a giant zombie poodle.(4 zombies) (and a giant zombie poodle)most entertaining part: the zombie poodle"
1,A true disappointment,"OK, I admit it. I love really awful horror films. I own all the Killer Tomatoes films. I love cheesy movies.This didn't make the cut.It is obvious that they spent their entire special effects budget on the first three bad guys who manifest in this film. By the time the two later characters become zombies, the budget is so depleted they throw a man in a poodle suit with werewolf hands. The production values are poor, the plot is predictable, and it's not even bad enough to be funny. All in all, the movie was a real disappointment, which is particularly bad, since I rented it HOPING it would be bad (but in an ironic, funny way).Skip this film, especially if you have any desire to respect Phyllis Diller, who plays Ms. Poopinplatz; an absolute travesty."
5,Little Rascals,These tapes bring back Great memories when I was a Child. My Children Now enjoy them as I once did. If you have trouble finding them Email me and I will tell you where you can Find the Full 21 Vol. Set. They Now have 1-12 Vol.. On DVD.
3,nothing special,The video is mediocre. There is a little bit of skin but nothing special. It's not anything that you couldn't see anywhere else.
3,Nice little phone but weak battery,"I bought this phone a year ago in white. It is a small phone and ergonomically designed. Fits hand comfortably but when rested between shoulder and ear, to free up my hands, my earlobe always pressed the mute button. The answering machine works fine, and if you have call-waiting, the flash button is a handy feature.All in all the phone is nice-looking/ergonomic/priced right, and the sound quality is good. Of course, there is a downside to all this. The battery life is HORRIBLE. 2 hours off the cradle and it's dead! I am forced into buying another phone after only a year. If you don't mind keeping this phone on the cradle whenever you aren't using it, it is a great buy. If you are like me and like to have the phone next to you wherever you are in the house, look elsewhere..."
4,Maybe 4 1/2,"First, I thank Amazon for helping me find this band. I like to randomly browse Amazon and sometimes I find a band that really sounds good. I checked out a few songs before I bought this, ""Pencil Fight"" and ""Withered"" to be exact, and loved those two tracks so I decided to get it. Every song on the album is great. I can listen to the whole thing through without skipping and enjoy every one of the 50 minutes it takes to listen to it. My only complaint would be that fact that ""Agent Orange"" was censored while ""Friends"" wasn't. IMO ""Agent Orange"" would have sounded better with the original lyric and ""Friends"" could do without they whole ""HEY MOMMA, CAN'T YOU SEE I'M F***ING COOKING?"" intro. But other than that, great cd. Highly recommended. Only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5? It's good but not as good as Muse's albums or Clutch's albums in my mind.Favorites: probably ""Mothra,"" ""Agent Orange,"" ""Withered,"" and ""Time for People"" but pretty much all the tracks are pretty good."
5,"Anyone who appreciates music, will appreciate this.","If you're into deep, moody rock with a twist on the standard form, this CD is for you. I first discovered the band live with Evanescence, and though they have a quite different sound than the latter, true rock fans will really appreciate the album. The band doesn't just do the standard love-and-betrayal thing, it goes further...into a mystical world of aliens, mothra, and school-yard pencil fights (well, metaphoricly). Good choice for a good ear... but if you're a new-to-rock teenybopper who only is here because of their link to Evanescence, I'd suggest something a little lighter."
4,If Syd Barrett......,"This is real nice, gentle, well crafted psychedelia. Sounds like it fell right out of the '60's. If Syd Barrett hadn't had mental problems/became an acid casualty, he might have fulfilled his potential, and ended up sounding something like this. There's a fair bit of melancholia here, but it's not as sad as it SOUNDS. I also hear some Robyn Hitchcock & John Lennon influences. Beautiful, shimmering vibrato guitars and breathy sung-spoke vocals abound here, as on all Clientele albums. The place I would recommend to start, though....is with the more recent ""Strange Geometry"", which is sheer genius."
2,the return? I think not,"Hailed as the return to form for GBVthe promise was unfulfilled for this listener. Hard for me to see how they can even make the claim. i know there won't be another Bee Thousand, but this disc wasn't even a bee one hundred. Bored me to deathIsolation Drills was great, and proof that great songs make a great record, wherever it's recorded. Universal Truths and Cycles just didn't deliver."
3,too much drums!,Too much drums especially on the head medly Leo. But good music for making sandwiches.
5,The Best Romance Reference Book Available!,"I've spend hundreds of dollars on various romance novel writing guides and books...But yet I still come back to this one. This is, by far, the best romance novel writing guide available. If you are serious about romance writing, you must read this book. My copy is so worn from use that I had to buy another."
3,one of the greats?,"as a lit major, i've heard lots about raymond carver as one of the masters of the short story, but i'm afraid that I have to disagree. carver spent part of his career known as a minimalist, meaning that every word in his stories carries meaning and there are no extras in them. that makes for quick reads, but I found the stories lacking. carver seems to skip important pieces of his stories and many of them don't seem to have an ending. they just cut off. I'm not saying that carver's work is not worth reading. it is. he was an important figure in american literature, and he is not a bad writer, I just find other authors, such as cheever, hemingway, and hawthorne to be the true ""masters"" of american short fiction. In fact, stories such as ""so much water so close to home,"" ""where i'm calling from,"" ""what we talk about when we talk about love,"" ""a small good thing,"" and ""they're not your husband"" to be excellent stories, and they alone make this collection worth purchasing."
2,Just Trying To Get Through It In One Piece...,"...I am really not enjoying it...I am probably in the minority. Carver's minamalist approach just does not have the kind of eloquence and magic that grabs me. Also, so many of the stories are centered around dysfunctional families, and feature alcaholism, and couples breaking up. Carver is very redundant, both in subject matter and method. I feel like Carver used the same formula for a lot of these stories, then plugged in slighty varying charachters in slighty varying circumstances. I am finding myself asking,""How many times can Carver beat a dead horse??"". In short, I find this to be tiresome. Strike that. It is maddening."
2,This book could have been so good,"You know, this book really could have shone. The premise is fabulous, the universe is wonderful, but the characters... Oh, the characters. I felt like I was watching a bunch of braindead, immature caricatures rather than a group of intelligent and mature adults. Also, our protagonist, who is supposed to be a brilliant scientist, takes until page 252 to figure out what we all realized back on page 101. The plot drags needlessly in some places, and races along too quickly in others. The real frustration is that with a good editor, this book could have been a gem. But instead, it's just a disappointing read."
2,Not that good,My seven and three year old were interested but some of the images in this video were confusing. It's definitely not worth buying. You're better off getting it from the library or buying some cartoons in Spanish instead.
3,"Frankly, I expected more...","I'm a big fan of the game and was really expecting a lot more.The first DVD, on some of the greats is a good one, 2 hrs of great clips.The speeches on the second DVD may be a bit boring for some people.The third DVD was the biggest disappointment. I believe the presentation could have been much much better. More statistics and more video clips would have been appreciated.Eventhough I gave it a 3, I was terribly disappointed. Buyers remorse? Maybe."
5,Perfect for red wine lovers who live alone!,"Although this shows the Sterling vacuum pump, I actually have the black, plastic pump and it is great! I have always enjoyed a nice glass of red wine with many of the meals I prepare at home. Until now, because I live alone, I had two choices: 1) open a bottle, have a glass and forfeit the remainder since it would get cloudy and lose it's taste or 2) forego the pleasure of a glass of wine with my meal. Now that I have the vacuum and stoppers, the problem is solved. An opened bottle of wine can last for up to a month or more! I highly recommend this item."
4,Happy with new JVC,"I changed my previous JVC Mini DV, which was 4 years old. Was looking to change it for a Sony mini Dv camcorder, based on reviews and size, however if you compare price vs quality of this JVC mini DV, I think it is the best on the market.Does not have night shot (green images), but even with low light quality is good. Has an integrated light, which none of the other camcorders have. Agree with previous comments. Do not buy an sd card as photos are really bad, I do not know where the 1.3 M pixels are. Quality of filming is good, weight probably 500 gr, and it is small. Screen is excellent, bright and high resolution. Software to capture in the PC not so good, but you can capture anyway with Windows media Player.Have it three months now and still convinced it was a very good purchase.regards"
5,Great service,The company I purchased this item from was very prompt and professional ; the product not so much! My nails are a mess from swimming. Then this smells toxic and stays on less than one day. Why even bother!
1,Fantastic Top Coat - but deadly,"I was so impressed when I received this & promptly used it as a top coat with fantastic results. However, after reading the ingredients, I was shocked to see that Formaldehyde is listed. I can't support a product that has carcinogens in it and nor should anyone else."
1,I wouldn't buy this again.,"I wouldn't buy this product again. The shine was absolutely fantastic. The product peels off as the day wears on. By the next morning, most of it had come off. I was very disappointed in the product."
1,Not for me,"my nails are thin and tear and break very easily, I had hoped this would help, but it made my nails so brittle, that they would just break off everytime they hit something sort of like a frozen branch. maybe would be good for people with thicker nails, I don't know but I had to stop using it after 2nd application."
2,Diffrent but not so original,"This album is pretty fun at times, a few songs are diffrent with weird titles and funky beats, problem is many of them are borrowed, they are for example stealing Public Enemy's famous beat from ""Night of the living baseheads"" to their ""Labour day"" in hip hop you got to be original and taking a sample or beat from another group is not cool. However they do have something to say in many songs, they are just like PE politically involved but not in the same way, they are trying to be serious in a unseriuos way so to say. Their new female member brings fresh blood to the group and it's been interesting to hear her contribution. BEP got my attention here with the Justin Timberlake song ""Where is the love"" which is very good song, and political in the right way, it's a fun CD but they didn't get their message out."
2,choose a style bol,"i was very much anticipating this record. the first i saw of it was the 12 lets get retarded. after listening i thought im not going to bother with it, but bridging the gap kept haunting my aural world, so i stepped into the library and strapped on the phones. after listening the only things i remembered were 'the boogie that be' and 'smells like funk'. the former is crunchy disco funk worth a single. the latter is a mos def rip off, check black on both sides for the truth. i was sad that the rest of the record has tried to cover so many bases it has no continuity - in the vein of common's electric circus but not in the same league.so check out their other records."
1,Talkin' 'bout goin' soft...,"What I do not understand is why on one hand people accuse G Unit, Jadakiss and Twista of turning commercial and on the other enjoy listening to this ""new"" black eyed peas cd. They have apparently turned their back on Hip Hop & Rap to get some money. What you can find here is just plain pop-music, which I occasionally listen to in clubs, respectively the radio, but generally try to avoid. For those who like HIP HOP/RAP pls stick to the roots, kanye west and talib kweli."
1,wat a load of crap,i had high hopes for bep album after listnin to songs like shut up and where is the love but wen i brought the album i was like why is evry1 saying this is a good album its crap. i wasted money on this album when i could of done something better like spend money on bog role.this must be the worst album yet from bep and probly the crappest album of the year. where is the love and shut up are the only good songs out of the album dont waste your money ive warned u
3,great sound,"This cd is all about the sounds........a lot of the songs are good altho some of the words are questionable...for example if you like their song Lets get it started---u will be disapointed to hear the original on their cd which is LETS GET RETARDED........if your not a fan of sound with lyrics that are ok then dont buy the cd......if you love to party, get up and dance, and just have fun to music then this is a great cd for you...."
2,"""Let's Get It Started"" is the only good track","My friend is way into the BEP's. He told me that their first album ""Behind The Front"" was the best, but I didn't really like it that much. Then he gave me ""Bridging the Gap"" and that was also, just average. Then he gave me ""Elephunk"", which is the worst one yet; except for the huge hit ""Let's Get It Started"". That song is probably the best song to have been made in the last 50 years. The original version, ""Let's Get Retarded"" is very derogetory and shameful. Making fun of the physically challenged is the lowest you can go. But I'll still give it 2 stars for ""Let's Get It Started""."
2,This is NOT the Black Eyed Peas I know,"I dont know of any other group that turned more commercial than the BEP. I enjoyed their two previous albums prior to this Elephunk, but this is just appealing to the masses to the point of begging to sell records. Like that song, Shut Up, what the hell is that, how can anyone think that's a good track. In their album Bridging the Gap, Apl talks about how they're the only true MCs that you'll hear on the radio, well, true MCs dont sell out, you guys are just hot garbage now.I'm Out!"
3,Best music of their 3 albums......but come on.,"I just had to throw something up to respond to the last post. I've been down with bep since 97 and your comment of Fergie having a great voice.... PLEAZ! See em live and you will realize it's all studio magic. She's a second place to Ashlee Simpson for worst female vocalist. Sorry kids, but this record is only hot because of the tracks the boys spit on. It's hard to love these guys now that they have gone so huge and record pop songs. From a producer standpoint....slickest record they have recorded. I'd like to get a copy that has all of her vocals removed!"
1,Piece of...,"Gee, I can't give this ZERO stars. I'd like to though.Where is the love? BEP slams all types of hatred and discrimination in their one hit from this lame CD, but then they decide it's OK to make fun of people with disabilities on ""Let's Get Retarded"". That's just plain disgusting. Tell ya what, boyz...come on over to my house and sing it for my developmentally disabled son. Then tell his sister that you don't mean anything offensive by it. Then try to sleep at night with a clear conscience.Jerks."
4,It grows on you,"After years of hearing hip hop on the radio (and usually turning it off) the sound has finally sunk in and I find myself humming/mumbling the songs under my breath (like Hands Up or The Boogie That Be) and figured I should buy the album so I can listen to it on my iPod. I wasn't disappointed. There's something almost soothing about the beat and the sound quality of this CD is excellent. I listened to it on the surround sound system downstairs with theVelodyne DEQ-10R 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Black)pumped up and the sound was amazing.There's a lot of variety in the different songs and I'm finding myself liking some that I've never heard before, like Let's Get it Started. Maybe I'll try another one of their albums."
5,hey mama,"if i could i would rate this cd 1,000,000,000,00 but 5 would do it a great cd if you don't get this cd you got retared"
4,elePHUNK!!!!,"B.E.P's first MAJOR album is OK, The songs are cool and I love repeating the songs I love, These are some Key songs for you to look out for!:Lets Get Retarded (LOL! I love this one!)Hey Mama (The truth is I dont like the version on this but the TV version is perfect!)Shut Up (Who could not love this!?!)Latin Girls (Cool!)Where Is The Love? (I am very sick of this song but Its an instant classic!)Well, yeah thats it, if you just love ""Where is the love?"" and ""SHUT UP"" I really reccomend you listen to the whole thing in some way before you buy this, cuz I think most people arent gonna like what they think they are gonna hear!, this whole album IS NOT like those 2 songs. I liked this, but it wasnt what I expected. You have been warned."
4,Let's Party (Hands Up!),"This is the perfect album to just have a good time and party with. The beats are mad, the flow is irrestistable, and the songs are all hyped up. ""Hands Up"" is fun and really makes you want to put your hands up, ""Hey Mama"", ""Shut Up"", ""Smells Like Funk"", ""The Boogie That Be"" are all just a pleasure to dance to. My favorite ""Let's Get Retarded"" (which is now released as ""Let's Get It Started"") lifts you up and gets you so hype its unbelievable. All the tracks will have you flowin' in your own individual way. If your a party person, who loves to just have a good time then pick this LP up and, as they so politely put it, LETS GET COO-KOO."
2,Black Eyed Peas sucked.,Black Eyed Peas sucked. They are the worst rapp group ever. it gets 2 out of 5.
1,"the ""popular"" album? Ugghh","i was always a big BEP fan back in the days of behind the front and bridging the gap and was dissapointed to find they had deserted the mean streets of NYC and adopted a ""pop"" sound. reeeeaaaallllly dissap. guys. fair enough, the new member Fergie(my future wife)is one foxy dudette, but she adds little to the whole affair. if pressed , i would say my topper track is shut up ( i can relate to the lyrics, huh players?) xxxx luv ya ferg"
1,Ely-spunk,"Yes this is one mass of spunky music. 12 year olds, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! 12+ year olds, dont be serious"
5,Awesome,I really love this album. I mean except for Lets Get Retarded and Sexy I love this CD. I can't wait until Monkey Business
3,"pretty goog, but not the best","i like rap/hip-hop. i really like Lets Get It Started, but the rest of the cd is just ok. I listen to it, but I have better cds. The best songs are prolly Hands Up, and Lets Get It Started. Okay cd, not great"
1,This album is a waste.,"Your better off buying real hip hop music. Black eye peas are not even a hip hop group. They are more of a hip pop group.This is coming from one a former dead hard Black eye peas fan, they sold out to white America. The only way they can make money is to turn their backs from hip hop and turn pop."
5,"""Must Have"" for Steelers Fans!!","This DVD set does an outstanding job of capturing the rich history of the Steelers. It contains a lot of footage from the first 40 years before the franchise won its first playoff game as well as great coverage of the 70s up through last season. The bonus DVD has great full-length documentaries on Terry Bradshaw, Jerome Bettis and Bill Cowher as well as shorter ones and much more."
5,Love it,We are huge Steelers fans so this was a no-brainier buy. Got it for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.
2,Poorly made; instructions are incompetent,"The instructions accompanying this target make no sense, and the pictures are just as bad. You will eventually figure it out, maybe, and end up with a lopsided target that sometimes works and usually doesn't reset. The instructions are also quite specific that the minimum distance from the shooter to the target is 30 yards. I'm not an expert shooter, but I'm reasonably competent, and I don't even attempt to hit a target this small at such distances with a handgun. If you use cheap ammunition, hitting this target from 30 yards (90 feet) will be mostly luck, since the ammunition won't be that accurate. Who are these people kidding? I understand the recommendation, though, because the steel is rather soft and easily dents. Shooting at an uneven steel surface is dangerous! Regardless, use only lead bullets, not jacketed ammunition. You'll probably have more fun hanging paper plates by string from a simple stand. Cheap and you know when you hit them!"
3,In case you got the wrong movie,"This movie was mistakenly advertised as the Cameron blockbuster in 3D for $20 with pre-order guarantee. If you suddenly end up with the wrong film give Amazon a call. They know about their error, and will fix the order for you!"
1,Huh,Not a review but I love the artwork showing the Titanic hitting the iceberg on the PORT side of the ship instead of the starboard side Hilarious. I mean ......really???
5,A must for their favorite groovy girl friend!,"My girls each have a favorite groovy girl. You know the one that is their constant companion? They have been with them for years. They have other groovy dolls, these are just the favorites. They can take all kinds of time making up special beds for them to sleep in at bedtime. I finally decided to pick up a pair of these sleeping bags for the favored pair of dolls (a Vanessa and Ladybug girl). Wow, the girls love them. Should have picked them up a few years ago. I completely have underestimated just how much they love having accessories for their dolls! My suggestion - if you are picking up a groovy girl as a gift, I would pick up a sleeping bag for her rather than a second doll. The bag even comes with a little stuffed bear. Pretty cute."
3,Llama Health and Management Guide,Book is somewhat outdated. Health information is very broad and not detailed. Much of what is talked about is common sense to anyone who has owned any type of large animal before.
3,Very Cute but Safety Unsure,"I like the toys a lot and so does my baby, but it doesn't have the necessary labels on if the plastic materials on the piggies and wolf or the cloth for the houses are baby safe, ie BPA / PVC free. They're freaking cute. I like that I can throw the houses in the wash. The lack of better labeling is across multiple major brands and products, though, so I'll fairly say that for what it is, it's very cute. I think a better industry standard may be what's need, so overall still good but not the best in safety in my opinion."
5,Slim Fashion,I bought this play set for my nephew who is 2 years old about to be 3 in a couple of weeks. He loved the toy especially the big bad wolf. He loves to make believe and pretend. He loves the 3 little pigs and the big bad wolf cartoon which I put on in youtube. He enjoys this toy very much.
3,Title is Misleading,"This book does not do what the title would lead you to believe. It is a beginning book in watercolor, with lessons showing all the basics, washes, dry brush, paint, paper and brushes. It does this very well, but I was expecting more discussion on how to look at a scene and simplify it. If you are a beginner, this is a great book. If you are not a beginner and are looking to take your painting to the next level, look for something else."
3,"A Good Bag, Could Do With Better Body Fit","I bought this bag for my MacBook. It is a good bag for a 15 inch laptop. It is somewhat too large for my 13 inch MacBook, but that gives me plenty of room for other things. The hidden drawer at the bottom for cables and small things is a great idea and takes away the clutter from inside your bag. the shoulder/backpack combo is convenient for my circumstances where I need both depending on how I travel of where I am. There are enough pockets and holders for your additional stuff. The only problem I find is that the design is somewhat uncomfortable to carry as a shoulderbag especially when heavy and when you extend the bag (it has an extension zipper if you need more room). It does not fit well with your body, but the backpack seems to work okay. Overall a good bag if you want a shoulder/backpack combo."
4,"Great bag, just a little big than you expect","This is a great product, owned for a year and had no complaints, except for the handle and body fit"
4,Agatha Christie's classics,"Peter Ustinov again doing a superb job as Hercule Poirot although far from Miss Christie's description of Poirot. Great supporting cast in one of AC's great stories. Well written, well acted, well photographed. Mystery fun for everyone."
5,"Great acting, who-dunn-it keeps you guessing","What a great movie! I remember watching it as a kid and had to see it again! Just gets better with time! All star cast with such theatrical acting! If you've never seen the movie before, you'd never guess who dunn it! They just don't make movies like this today. This stimulates the mind without all the gore. Very comical, too. Highly recommended."
5,Great videos!,Excellent videos. Very educational but in a fun way and they look very real!! My 4 year old is obsessed with dinos and watches these videos every chance he gets. Only caution is if you don't want to see dinosaurs hunting / biting / eating each other :)
4,great garage punk album,"A great garage punk record from a seriously christian band. Some think it's a joke and others don't. My opinion is that they really believe it. Anyway, they can play, there are several great tracks on this record. They can also be quite funny, whether intentional or not. The record has one of the hardest rocking anti-war tracks I have ever heard and the last track (sung in tounges) is probably the only song like it ever recorded."
4,A Must Buy,"I enjoy learning from this book.I'm 13 to say the truth and i'm not an amateur or professional.I had brought other manga drawing books parts of this series, and I think this book could really help anyone who wants to learn to draw manga style.They explained how to draw the face really well.It was easy to follow and it explained the parts of the face.Facial expressions was a good section and shows the key to drawing many kinds!They also helped me learn to draw the body better.Shows varties of movements.I was happy that they show how to make a good decent manga.But! the materials they tell you to use,are all worth good in japan.^^; Well it's not their fault but really,so many materials >.<And last of all,they didn't really help in drawing hair but they did explain in breif of hair movements.Overall,this book is really good^_^ if you overlook the lack of exlaining in the hair section and the confusing needs of materials @.@ you'll love it:)"
3,Fine If You're New to This Issue,This book is fine if you are new to post-deployment issues/PTSD but it doesn't offer much in the way of new or ground-breaking insights. It's a little boring.
5,EXCELLENT Product !!!,"EXCELLENT Product & solid built !!! Does what its meant to do, does cool down the temp a lil (via the radiator). Used on my Jeep 4x4 during our desert experditions - where it gets very, very HOT... 48C plus !"
5,Folk and Black Fusion's Magnum Opus,"Bergtatt is such an incredible album and one of Ulver's best achievements. This gave the genre known as black metal a new makeover and proved that by bending a few rules and drawing many influences, you can create a masterpiece. The production is raw, but it's not the borderline white noise or bedroom quality recordings expected from many bands of the genre. It's an album full of beautiful folk-laden melodies, black metal intensity, and some of the strongest songwriting that the genre will ever produce. The atmosphere produced by all of this makes it easy to just relax and enjoy the brilliant telltale masterpiece Ulver created. Nothing can ever compare to this, it's a breathtaking odyssey that is definitely worth your time."
4,Don't listen to those one star reviews.....,"This is a very good book. There is no reason for those one star reviews....I read this book in slightly more than 2 days (which is incredibly fast for me and my schedule). It has a wonderful pace and I kept it in the front seat and read it at red lights. I didn't want to put it down. I prefer the feeling of the ""Winter of the Wolf Moon"" book because I felt the cold as I read it. This book will also put you in the position of Alex McKnight while he gets himself into even more tough situations (he does have a knack for that)."
3,I'm Torn,"Alex McKnight is an ex-cop, now occasional private investigator, living in idyllic (if you like it cold) Paradise, Michigan. An old friend talks Alex into helping to find an old flame. There's just one teeny tiny problem, he hasn't seen or heard from this woman for around 30 years or soI find that I was torn between two emotions after finishing this book. As a mystery reader I didn't feel I had reached closure by the end. The story never really went anywhere, probably because the protagonist isn't my idea of a particularly strong or resourceful leading character. On the other hand, as a reader of literature, I appreciated Steve Hamilton's obvious literary talent and found myself drawn into the story on that level.I like to feel, by the end of a book, that something has been achieved. I didn't get that with this story."
2,an okay thing,this is a decent book i guess. the only reason to buy it is to see some rare lou reed pictures. the author's writing is cliched and boring. he sucks up to lou reed so badly that it's embarassing.
1,Short story,"Get into the book and it is done, either they didnt finish it or they cut off from download, I know my server is TOP NOTCH!"
4,As fast paced as a boxing match,"Once again, Jack London brings you completely in another world, in another's way of thinking and puts you in someone else's shoes for a hour. This time, the master shows us the emotions and needs of two lovers, on the brink of their wedding day. What drives a man to combat ? Could a gentle lady understand that part of him ? Life, as usual, in all its glory, its twists of fate, and its unrelenting progress."
5,My favorite Christmas show,"This is a classic and the songs are fantastic. The DVD is a great purchase because the one they show every year on ABC family leaves out the song ""Give Your Heart a Try"" to fit in a couple extra commercials."
4,Fashionista's Fever!! Vogue lovers this book has your name on it!,"Louise de Teliga brings us a kind of biographical novel with NY as an awesome backdrop.Josie is an Aussie ex model who at 36 finds herself jobless and getting older by the minute; she asks ex boyfriend and power photographer to give her a job as a stylist only to sleep with his hunky and straight assistant Marcus whose photographs of her legs take her a step closer to newfound fame.Josie is a fashionista and a fashion slave, wearing tight shoes and ultra miniskirts to show off those extra long legs of hers. Cavalli, Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Vuitton, you name them, they're here and the Seventh Avenue Rodeo will only make Josie stronger and increase her ability to land on her stilettoed feet.A sharp, smart, and dark novel with the secrets to backstage shoots and fashion love affairs.All of you witty, vogue reading, fashion oriented, Manolo wearing, sexy, saucy, and gorgeous women out there... You'll love this book and all its fashion talk."
4,Good beach read,"Read this while vacationing in Hawaii. Good fashion references, somewhat predictable storyline, but all fun."
1,Not so great,"The idea of the watch is wonderful, but the execution is, well..., lame. This is primarily because it is hard to read in any light, and setting it is very difficult. It was inexpensive so I thought it would be fun for my daughter even if, as other reviews said, the animation was easily set off, but the fact that it is hard to read just about makes it useless."
3,Has to be close to you to feel the breeze,"I was thinking of buying one of these fans. I saw a demostration model in a store and tested it, but I didn't feel any breeze from its position on the shelf. It was only when I took it off the shelf and held it about 12"" from my face that I felt the fan. On the good side, it is very quiet though."
2,Loud,"The little guy keeps a good flow, but it has acquired a loud ticking sound after only 3 weeks of use!! I have change nothing, it simply started making noise!"
1,was very nice........until,"It was a great fan when it was working.I was using my fan on a camping trip in my camper, when I smelled plastic melting. It was the fan where the on off switch is located, it was extremely hot and I went to unplug the adapter it too was also extremely hot. If I had left it plugged in, I am sure there would have been a fire. I am looking on line to see if there is any kind of recall of this fan."
1,broken unit!,"The legs were a bit tricky to put down, and when I did, I busted the mounts. Never even used this thing & threw it away. Coleman makes one that I bought that's better built, and Excalibur Electronics has one available as well that I also bought - I like Excalibur's better, but both are better than this piece of junk. All 3 brands are in the same price range. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of portable ac/dc fan options out there... I bought these for camping in Florida."
4,BECSTASY GATEWAY,"I GOT THE CD FOR THE CURRENT SINGLE 'GATEWAY' AND TO MY SURPRISE ... THEY WERE AT LEAST 3 MORE TRACKS THAT I HAD HEARD BEFORE, BUT, HAD NO IDEA IT WAS HER AND THOSE ARE ... 'HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH"" , ""IF YOU LOVE ME & MY FAVORITE TRACK "" TAKE IT AWAY"".WORD OF ADVICE ... HER MARKETING GROUP NEEDS AND MUST STOP WITH THE PLAYBOY BUNNY IMAGE THEY HAVE CREATED FOR HER AND PUT MORE EFFORT IN HER TALENT.I REMEMBER WALKING INTO A RECORD SHOP MONTHS AGO AND JUST SAW THE CD COVER AND SAID ... ""ANOTHER PRETTY GIRL WITH NO TALENT "" AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE LOOKS CAN BE VERY DECEIVING.AMAZING VOICE AND GREAT BEATS .... WHAT ELSE MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?"
2,Not One of Her Best,"Reprint, so check for it in your library--you won't want to spend for this one. Very tired plot involving male domination as the way to a woman's heart. It definitely shows it's '80's roots. Plot is somewhat contrived and it's obvious who the bad guy is early on. Very disappointing"
4,Old School Training,Woodhouse was an old School Trainer. She believed in a proper choke chain. Just like Ceaser she found the problem was the owners not the Dog.
1,awful!,this book is awful and does not go into detail on how to train your dog. she says you should have your dog killed for way to many reasons.she uses choke chains and never speaks of praising.
2,Excellent resource for training PUPPIES,"We have a problem dog, and had heard that this book was excellent for learning how to train dogs. However, we found it's an excellent resource for training PUPPIES. This book assumes you'e starting out with a puppy, and does not address how to deal with problems already ingrained in an adult dog."
1,Poor quality,I wish I could return these and my Wescott lights that never seem to work right. Very disappointing for the money I paid.
5,Forever.,This is one of the best metal albums ever made...Rest in peace Chuck. You will be remembered forever for extending the boundaries of heavy metal!
2,Ruined by terrible vocals,"I don't know about you, but screaming, gurgling vocals and lyrics about death and dying don't do much for me. It's a shame too, because this band is so obviously talented that I just couldn't bring myself to give it one star. In his defense, ""lead screamer"" Chuck Schuldiner also plays guitar. Sorry all you fans, but I just don't see how this singing ""fits the music very well"", ""is EAR SHREDDING!!"", or is ""emotionally brutal"". What happened to being a good singer, as opposed to being a good ""RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"""
3,"Good for beginners, covers only NT/2000","Book is good as a tool for beginners and as a review of technology. It is for those who are in Windows world only. Presumption is that both database and application server are installed on the same PC, which is not always true."
3,Was fun for a while,"We bought this castle, the batman one as well, they play with it for a while, and then sits for a while, then play with it again for a while....It's an okay toy...fosters their imagination."
4,Good for kids and adults,"I ordered this book for my 12 year old son. It was required reading for school, but I decided to read it before he started it. I was surprised at how much I liked this book. It was a quick read, and I stayed interested the whole time. It's great for sparking thoughtful conversations about genetic manipulation, survival skills, ethics, and more. Highly recommend."
4,Review,"This is a good story for any age. I never wanted to put the book down. There is a few parts that in which are hard to understand, you just have to read the book, so you can see for yourself."
2,Dr. Franklins Island,"This book was good, but its not my favorite book ever. It was surprising at some points in the story but sometimes boring. In the beginning of the book it got interesting because you wanted to know more about the plane crash that Semi, Arnie and Miranda got into. They were the only 3 that survived. I would recommend this book to basically anyone, but I don't know how they'd feel about it. Some people may have other opinions than me but thats what I thought of this book."
4,What can I say?,This book was the first decent book I have read in a long while. The voice is refreshing and perfected. The characters dealed out by a Vegas champ.The most disturbing part of this novel is that it frustrates the reader who is trying to know and help the characters--even as the characters are losing themselves.It also exposes deep questions like: How strong are we alone? and What is it like to be next in line?I would not hesitate to recommend this book to man or beast.
2,Wow this CD sucked,"The only songs on this CD that was even worth listening to was Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional and maybe The song by Taking Back Sunday, but that is already on their new CD. I wish I would not have paid 10 dollars for this. It is pretty much crap."
4,Exceptional Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to the movie ""Spiderman 2"" is a really great album. It's the only place to find Dashboard Confessional's wicked song ""Vindicated"" other than purchasing their single. I love Train and the song ""Ordinary"" was no disappointment. The song by Hoobastank is no match for ""The Reason"" and is rather mediocre. I was pretty shocked at Maroon 5's song ""Woman"". I love this band but that song stinks. Yellowcard proved themselves once again with ""Gifts and Curses"", creating one of the best songs on the album. The rest of the cd is so-so but that is overshadowed by a few outstanding singles. The last two tracks are orchestrations of the Spiderman and Doc Ock Suite. They are also great. I highly reccommend this cd especially if you enjoyed the original Spiderman soundtrack and the Daredevil soundtrack."
5,This CD is what it says it is:,"1. This CD is not a collection of scores. It makes that clear, so don't complain that there are only 2 scores on the track.2. This CD contains music from AND inspired by the movie. 3 of the songs are from the movie; and I can safely say that all but one of the others is completely related to the movie. And the old song that is actually in the movie ( Raindrops falling on my head?) doesn't really fit with the theme of the CD.The playlist is on the back. Look before you buy. But if you loved the movie, you will definitely love this CD. Except for the one track by Maroon 5 which doesn't fit at all, every song is awesome and is completely in line with the movie. All are good, but I thought that the ones by Dashboard confessional, Train, Ana and especially Yellowcard are standouts. Gifts and Curses by Yellowcard captures Peter Parker's romantic struggle so perfectly its scary.So in short:Get the CD and you will like it for what it is."
2,SOME GOOD SONGS BUT...,"First I want to say that I bought this cd because I like a lot the music from Jet and Midtown and decided to give it a try because it has a modest group selection. When I heard the first song ""Vindicated"" I said WOW this cd is going to be awsome, the second song is very boring as Hoobastank song. I have to admit that Jet's song is totally great! also Midtown song, but all the other songs are just boring. I recomend you to first listen the song samples because this cd for me anly has 3 good songs that aren't worth the money, download them better."
3,"Perfect, the price is right","Solid and the work great for the price.I say stay away for the all metal ones, these plastic and metal ones are great."
1,Terrible quality.,"I would never suggest anyone to buy this slide whistle. The entire lower half of the slide-range isn't even usuable, it makes a terrible shrieking sound. The rest of the notes play inconsistently, only if you pull the slide at a weird angle. After much frustration, I opened it up and took a look inside to see what the problem was. The plastic diaphragm that vibrates to make the sound still had stubs on it from where the mold injected the plastic, which deformed the shape of the diaphragm as it was pushed up against the tube, allowing air to bypass the diaphragm altogether, preventing it from making a good sound.This is a complete waste of money, don't buy it."
2,hmmmmmm,"well here we go againanother re release of an old release of stuff from years ago. its generally ok but a fan can only go over and over again on how songs started out and where the went in the next 22 years. i love the melvins, but a brand new, well constructed album would be a really nice change..."
4,thorough and old fashioned,"I like the multi-faceted presentation of language in this book. Of course, the computer language section is a bit laughable, but you gotta realize the book was published in the '60s. Excellent conversation starter. Old fashioned illustrations have enough charm and the text is engaging enough for a 9-year-old who is an avid reader."
4,Big dial and large numbers!,This is an excellent watch for an active person. It is durable yet looks good too. I really appreciate the easy to read face.
2,Not for rugged outdoor use,"Bought this watch from Amazon about 5 months ago. After a few months the plastic case inlet part that holds the band pen broke. Since the cost to ship back to Timex and possibly the damage was my fault decided to buy the same watch again from Amazon. One week ago, the watch broke at the same place. Will not buy a Timex again because the housing is cheap made. The watch however keeps excellent time and has a nice look but for outdoors do not buy."
4,A Fine Watch,"I like this watch a great deal and have very few complaints. It is easy to read, keeps great time, and the battery has lasted for almost three years now.The band is my only complaint. As with most velcro, after a few hundred (or thousand as it actually may be) openings and closings, it begins to get less secure. I find I have to tighten it up more often than I used to. Still, the watch is so light I usually forget it is there. I do not think you'll be disappointed."
5,I love this watch,"This is the second one of these watches I have purchased and I bought two this time. I work in maintenance and am a wood worker and DIYer on the weekends. I have a special Expedition for weekends that can do all of the dirt, sawdust etc. I needed a pretty heavy duty watch that can also serve as a good looking functional, can take the rigors of machine rooms, sometimes dressed up daily grind. This watch with the velco band is just what the doctor ordered. Has military time as well as the backlight, I hope to always have one of these watches."
2,"Thurston Moore, what were you thinking?","Angsty college rock revivalists Black Helicopter turn back the dial about 20 years and do it up Buffalo Tom meets Dinosaur Jr. style on their disappointingly uneven debut Invisible Jet. Featuring members from since defunct but relatively well regarded Boston based groups Kudgel and Green Magnet School, Black Helicopter have played with the likes of Sonic Youth, Shellac, and Mission of Burma. And yet, paradoxically, despite their impressive resume, Black Helicopter stands out as anything but. The phenomenally derivative and incredibly trite Invisible Jet is about as profound as a 13 year old girl's diary and equally as relevant. In all a less than mediocre record from a band that had the potential to produce something fantastic. Ultimately, however, they end up sounding like less than the sum of their influences. (For what it's worth, `Head of Steam' is an awesome song... play it, everything else... not so much)."
5,Timex women's watch,"I really like the watch. It's sporty looking, large enough for me to read and I love the indiglo feature. It's a great price as well. I work outside a lot and wanted a reasonably priced, durable watch. This one is it."
4,fuel pump review,This is a solid unit. The only negative is the way the pump attaches to the bracket. The 3 stud/nut combination seems too small to hold the pump up. I ended up drilling the studs and using safety wire on the nuts.
1,This book is a scam!,"The book is racist and ignorant at best. It is hypocritical at worst because it is itself a scam. It plays up the stereotypes that people have about traveling people and feeds on the fears about those who are mysterious and different. There are better sources of information about travelers. I suggest visiting The Patrin at http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/reading.htm for recommended books. Most are about the Romani but there are also a number of books on the Travelers in Great Britain and America. They may not be as titillating but they are certainly more informative and accurate, which makes them much more interesting in the long view."
3,"bad movie, hot star","This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It has no plot, the acting stinks, and the characters are all cliches. But this movie does have one thing going for it. Pia Zadora is absolutely hot in this film. Her acting is the normal below standard but man is she easy on the eyes. My recomendation, wait till it is on skinemax at 3AM and tape it. Do not spend $50+ for this movie."
2,"Not a great movie, but...","Pia Zadora is sooo sexy! I'm her bigest fan, and wish she could of had better luck in her career. I love you Pia!"
2,Motor noise recorded on tape.,"Although the motor noise is insignificant during recording, whatever little that's produced propagates fairly well to the recording media. In quiet to moderate settings at home, you WILL hear the motor noise grinding in the background. This was a show stopper for me. The JVC technical support staff were not helpful at all. And therefore, this unit is going back."
2,"Motor noise is, in fact, excessive","I read the reviews and decided to take the plunge anyway. This was a mistake and I ended up returning the camera because of the loud motor mechanism that resulted in a constant train sound in the background of my video. This is my first review on Amazon but I felt compelled to express my disdain about the audio quality of this product.I researched the product on various message boards and they seemed to indicate that this was the result of the microphone gain being adjusted in quiet environments. To my dismay, it seems that the noise is picked up in any environment because the motor mechanism is simply very very loud. The noise is captured on tape and is so loud it is hard to filter out without ruining the sound track.I purchased a Panasonic GS14 and while the CCD isn't as good as the JVC's, there is no motor noise at all. The difference is night and day.My advice is to pass on this model as the noise is very excessive and ruins an otherwise competent product."
5,Wondrous Love,"Best new bluegrass CD in several years. Really tight harmonies, superb vocal range, great music. The best!"
2,Doesn't maintain air pressure,"I have had this air mattress for about 2 months now. The bed was great at first. Inflated easily within a minute or two. Setup was nice and extremely portable due to the battery pack. After 2 months, though, it doesn't hold air pressure for a single night. There are no holes or rips, but after a night you end up on the ground. I think this is due to the material stretching. I wouldn't buy this again if stuck in this situation. I say you would be better off spending an extra 40-50 and getting a mattress with better quality materials that wont stretch easily."
4,Mystery Solved.,"Al is in the Von Zippers. I think that might be some Tom Bagley from Forbidden Dimension and The English Teeth on the Keys, sometimes anyways. Geezers, not really, I'd say they're still fresh, although aged. They are a brillant band to see live. This is the most mature album from the Von Zippers, all the songs are exploring new ground. Crime Is Now is passionate rock n' roll, with some howling guitar, screaming vocals, and serious political views, that you won't even notice until you're humming them in your head. If it reminds me of any Damned album it would be Machine Gun Etiquette."
4,She loves it!,"Santa brought this for my 6 year old this past Christmas. She is ALWAYS using it. The sound is clear using the CD player-it's not HD quality, but it's for us more spoiled adults! The radio only gets a couple of FM stations and I live in a pretty open area. It's not an issue with my daughter since she plays her Hanna Montana and Disney CD's over and over and over....I think $50 is a little pricy for the radio-of course I saw it for $80 while searching and as usual Amazon had the best price. All in all, the design is adorable, prefect for little girls!"
2,light taste,"I liked the taste but I was dissapointed that is so light. I had to add 3 tablespoons in a recipe that needs less than 1 tablespoon to get the flavor. It tastes good, but very light."
5,"good book, but can't please everyone","I thought this book was good. But i also have to admit, i picked it up for the first time and put it back on the shelf thinking it wouldn't have enough horses in it. I went back and got it, and loved it. To all those people out there who are complaining that there are not enough horses in it, Ms. Bryant can't please everyone. The characters are not perfect, but not awful. To all you readers, I hope you will give Pine Hollow a try. This book displays teen views and problems in real life, plus it talks about horses. Also for me, if i wanted more INFORMATION about horses, I would just get a real book on horses. I think it is great what Ms. Bryant is doing with her new series. The characters are growing up, so she should write them like they are. Your books are great Ms. Bryant, keep up the good work!"
5,teen life finally meets horses,"Thank you for this book. When I was in grade four and five I enjoyed reading Thoroughbred, the Saddle Club and Pony Pals, obviously now been fourteen those books are way too young for mature teenage readers who love horses.This series is perfect for mature horse loving teens to get their fill of horsie books, without being sickened with the immauturity of a younger series.I reccomend it to all teen horse lovers, definatly worth a try! I'm addicted!"
3,A Little Disapointing But Still Okay,"I've read the Saddle Club books for years but since I'm 15 they started to seem a little...I don't know..young from me. (This coming from a person who watches Pokemon.) When I found out about the more mature series, I ran out to buy the first book. But when I read it, it just seemed like another one of those teen saga stories with some horses thrown in. I wish someone would create a series about REALISTIC teens who ride. I guess I'll try another Pine Hollow book, but if they're all gonna be dramatic and ""teeny"" then I'll have to spend my time watching Pokemon, Daria, and Hey Arnold!"
4,Worth the Money,"Great, amazing, easy, fast, simple ... just a few words for this product. File Solutions made our home files so much easier to access. Whether you go with colored folders or not, it really doesn't matter, just makes it ""pretty"". Reading through the book that defines what goes in each category made things easier. Puchase, spend an afternoon, and be file organized forever!"
5,False Holiness Exposed! and Destroyed!,"Dr. Hellmann's text helped me to overcome past religious traditions that were handcuffs to my spiritual life. False Holiness Exposed helped free me from a deep seated belief that following religious and denominational rules would assist me in reaching my eternal salvation. It helped expose my self-made standards for moral and righteous living by revealing God's true standards. Trying to make yourself holy doesn't save, only Jesus saves. Belief in the One the Father sent is the only religious rule that matters. Once free of my old self-imposed restrictions I found it easier to enter into worship, to pray, and to fellowship with the Holy Spirit - my daily companion. I encourage all who want to enter into a deeper, stronger relationship with God to read this book. Remove your man-made roadblocks and receive free access to God."
1,Linksys BEFSR81 Cable/dsl Route Ver.3,I am very dissapointed with this router. It has slowed down my connection speed to a snails pace. I downloaded the firmware upgrade and changed the propety settings as suggested by linksys but this router still lags. I cannot use it to play online games or logon to my company citrix server without experiencing long delays when communcating. I have a sprint/pcs aircard on my laptop and it has a faster connection speed than this unit! I had a belkin 4 port/wireless router that I was using for 3 years and never had problems like this. The amount of time I wasted and frustration I have experienced trying to get this unit to work properly doesnt make it a deal at any price they are asking. Maybe it works ok for basic email or chatrooms but Good Luck getting it to reliably transfer data at high speed if you rely on your router. I give it 1 star because it did connect to the internet.
3,Good buy.,"Good buy, easy setup. Support is fair, off shore somewhat hard to understand and sometimes confused about whats going on."
2,Buyer beware...,"The box works well, both a switch and broadband router. Setup was simple and worked seamlessly with our network and DSL (Verizon) connection. However...... we purchased the box primarily to support connecting to a LAN via a VPN and had trouble from the get-go. It appears that the box only supports one concurrent VPN session. There is nothing in the product literature to warn of this, only that it supports VPN and IPSec (amongst other) protocols. Further delving into the product support pages on the web reveals the rather ambiguous statement that it 'supports at least one VPN session'. Linksys technical support have not had the courtesy to respond to any requests for information."
1,Port Forwarding Nightmare,After having the BEFSR81 for about two years it fizzeled out so I went out and bought a replacement the BEFSR81 V3. This was step back for Linksys. With the first router I didnt have many problems and was able to setup port fowarding for online gaming very easily. With the V3 router I couldn't even get on the internet until after a firmware upgrade.Then I tried to forward ports for TeamSpeak and running online game servers. I could not get it to work. After a total of six combined hours of trying to setup the router and on tech support calls I have given up and it is going back for another product.
2,This Used to be a Good Router,"I purchased an earlier version of this router (it is currently v. 3.1) and had many years of perfectly reliable good use, until a lightning strike blew out several ports. I ordered another one, confident it was a good product. Big mistake. Just from looking at it you can tell it has been downgraded - 1 activity light per port where there used to be 3. It is unable to maintain a consistent connection with my Time-Warner cable modem. I've had the cable modem swapped out twice and tried three different routers, and all had the same problem; random disconnects and reconnects varying from at least one a day to several an hour. In desperation I hooked up the old one, and it's running fine on its remaining ports.If you do purchase this router and have trouble with it, make sure you get it taken care of while its still on Amazon's 30 day guarantee. Linksys customer support is a nightmare."
1,Garbage,Inflated it and it did not even resemble a circle shape. Had all sorts of crazy bends in the frame. Was about as aerodynamic as a feather without the bird. Tried to adjust the frame and it cracked and popped out almost immediately. The frame cut me when it popped out. Avoid this product.
2,Too Flimsy to Even Throw,"This is our second Hover Disc. The first one did not last very long, but at least it was a lot of fun to throw while it lasted. This one is simply not the same. The outside plastic ring that keeps the hover disc's circular shape is so flimsy you cannot even throw it without the entire thing buckling in your hands. Our first one had a nice firm outer ring that would enable you to throw it with a good heave. This one is practically useless. I am extremely disappointed."
4,Nice toy.,"This is a fun toy. Not sure how long it will last but I think they all last about the same, depending on how much abuse it takes!"
1,Hover Disc is one-time-use...ours flew away!,"I bought the hover disc for my 3 1/2 year old son. I read the packaging thoroughly and it indicated that if you would like it to ""hover"" you should fill it with helium rather than air (and don't use it in windy conditions). Well, we went to the store, filled it with helium, took it to the park (it was not at all windy) and my son threw it in the air and it hovered...and hovered...and hovered...all the way across the river!!! Needless to say my son was extremely upset and for that matter so was I!! I wrote the company but have not heard back from them. The manufacturer needs to warn consumers not to fill with helium for outside use! (Even the description on Amazon.com doesn't warn us!)"
1,Not worth the cost,This hover disc needs to be made with a more durable material. It ripped the first day. I bought 3 of these and so far 2 of them failed. I would like a refund!
2,Oh MY GOD... Don't let your kid's whatch Nestor!,"Alright... we all know The Year without a Santa Clause is GREAT, who wouldn't or couldn't love this holiday classic! However, Nestor has got to be one of the most disturbing Christmas children's movies made!Unless you can afford costly psychotherapy for the youngsters, keep them away from Nestor. I wish I could say that I am joking, but I am not!"
1,Neither copy that I got would play!!,"I have usually had really good experiences with Amazon but alas, life is not always perfect. The first copy that I recieved would not play in either of our DVD players or our computer so I was sent a replacement and it was exactly the same. I have sent them back and expect a full refund. Better luck next time I guess."
3,Bought it to play along with a Rifftrax.,"And for that purpose it was just fine. Only needed Nestor for that, so didn't watch anything else."
4,It's classic Santa,"Its classic Santa. Not my favorite Santa story, but my kid love it. He plays it year round and it keeps them happy. What else can you ask for?"
5,Chrismas Kids Shows,"Hi I can say that even as an adult I still love these shows I think any child who believes in Christmas will love these shows it just doesn't seem like Christmas with out them they seem to go with this time of the year just as much as the Chrstmas Tree does my son loves them and I at 39 still do to I have never seen a child that didn't so you can't go wrong with The year with out Santa, The Nestor the long eared Christmas donkey, Rudolf's Shiny New Year.I hope every one has a Merry Christmas to you and your Familys I hope this helps but I do think most of you know these shows I never missed them growing up and couldn't think of children not having the chance to know and see them to."
5,i like it!,"fast delivery, good package, good service, lovely bookmarker, and most importantly, good book! i like it! :-)"
1,It's a cheap xerox copy,"This is a great book, but th[is] version ...is a cheap xerox copy of the original. The illustrations are of very poor quality and it's not worth [the item price]. I sent it back."
2,I need a clarification,"Good day friend, I wish you success in your businessI received the box with my products, but there is none of the rear bushings.ENERGY SUSPENSION 16.18110G MASTER SET FOR HONDA CIVICThey were in the package? or not they contain?I ask because according to the product description says all I need to come and see all the back missing.I hope your news to get the feed backI`m sorry but don`t speak inglish.Regards,jonathanmarro"
1,A low- energy slog....,"As an enthusiast of Western Swing and a disc jockey who has programmed Western Swing for 24 years on Atlanta FM radio, I looked forward eagerly to hearing ""Adventures In Country Swing"" and playing it for my listeners. The reviews were so positive and glowing that I thought I'd just take the plunge- after all I know the Light Crust Doughboy's work from the 1940's (nice stuff!) and I dug the Ventures from way,way back.I'm sad to say that this CD is as low on energy as any I've heard in recent memory. Nokie Edwards is relegated to acoustic guitar for the most part and Tom Brumley is primarily restrained by the anemic rhythm section. Bland electric keyboards shackle any enthusiasm the music might generate and the arrangements are weak........... what a huge disappointment. This could have been a sparkling, energetic romp but for the most part is a real slog. Do the other reviewers even know what exciting Western Swing is? I wonder.."
5,Best home video compilation ever,"This video, while recorded by fans on various camcorders in the 1980s, is probably the best home video compilation documenting a band there is. This video takes you through the days before Kill 'em All, with interviews, performances, and photos all the way into the Master of Puppets tour. There are even clips with Dave Mustaine on lead guitar at Cliff's 2nd gig with the band.Some people will complain about the quality of the audio and video. For those people I say:1) What footage exists of this band during this time period with better quality audio / video?2) This is supposed to be an amateur video compilation.If you haven't seen Metallica with Cliff Burton, this is definitely worth adding to your collection."
3,Good Band But Bad Quality,"I am one of the biggest fans of Metallica, but this dvd has some of the [worst] video ever. It was basically recorded with a personal video camera from like 1980 or something. They put a lot of good old Metallica songs, but just [bad] footage. If you are one of those people who follow metallica through everything then get it, but if you are just one of those people who just started getting into them, dont waste your money."
5,Cliff Lives!!!,A must for any fan of Metallica. Cliff wastveir heart and sound. His bass solos are better tahn anyone else's and his performance level was of the highest calliber.
5,100 % Cliff,This DVD is one of the best collection of Metallica if you are truelly fan you will see the routs of Heavy Metal back in the eithys!!!!
5,Love this movie,"Bought this dvd for my brother who loves Metallica, he loves it! This is a great DVD for the true Metallica fan!"
3,weak-...batteries,"I bought this... about a week ago. I exchanged a similar Porter-cable l9.2v cordless saw because it seemed that the batteries didnt last as long as they should (the manufacturer touted l24 2X4's)... I exchanged it for the Dewalt saw. The 18v Dewalt's batteries don't last any longer than the Porter Cable's l9.2v, but the Porter Cable had more power. I am not impressed with the tool. Manufactures claims on tool-company web sites claim this saw can cut 125-175 2X4's on a single charge. NO WAY!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I ordeered this for my 91-year-old mother. I did not realize it was full of difficult (even for me!) snaps and had to be folded like an origami project. From the picture I thought there were sleeves. OOOOPS, once again I was wrong. If I had put it together for her to use, she would have broken her neck trying to get into it. I plan to return this item. She and I were both very disppointed."
4,West Coast Wizards,"I enjoyed this video story of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. I am sure there is a lot more to the story of these two men but it was fun. Mark Twain commented on War and Peace by Tolstoy saying it did not have a motorboat race. Can't have everything!?! Is there a secret message here?John Cutler Anderson, Lucky (nickname)"
3,Interesting topic ends up being a good rainy day flick,"The Steve Jobs/Bill Gates story is really interesting yet the film seems to take too many turns that aren't necessary. You don't like either of the two by the film's end (like you did at first) yet your somehow captivated by their impact. But there's too much story left out. The last 5 minutes should of been an hour and the first hour should of been 5 minutes. Some really cool retro music in here but in the end it looks like ""Forrest Gump"" for computer nerds. Rent it on a rainy day."
5,Learn the History of Apple vs Microsoft,"Great movie, very informative, I learned alot about the rivalry between these two giant companies. I recommend you see this movie."
5,... REAL WORLD .... REAL HISTORY ....,.... With so sad recent events ... Mr . Job`s ... EARLY ... departure ... this is a great period film ...of a such a wonderful HUMAN BEING ... this film is potrays a beautiful & magical era ... early 70`s ... nicely backdroped with a cuople of tunes by one of the best ever great brit-bands from the seventies... THE MOODY BLUES .ESTEBAN POSADA DUQUE / Medellin
4,This movie confirms it...,"...This is a brilliant TV movie that shows Jobs' rise to the top of the computer world and Gates stealing his glory. It is often funny, sometimes dark, and oddly educational. Anthony Michael Hall makes for an excellent Gates, looking and sounding exactly like the man. The young man playing Jobs also does a tremendous performance. I suggest anyone interested in the world of computers take a look at this movie. It's fascinating, comical, and riveting."
4,Accurate of Steve Jobs .. But false of Gates,"Pirates of Silicon Valley was a very interesting movie, it put together all the bits and pieces that I know about Apple and Microsoft.The movie portrays Steve Jobs very accurately, just like I remember him ... but it also portrays Gates as a very insecure guy, which he was never.Overall, I have to give this movie a thumbs up, for both entertainment, and historical value, but be careful when it comes to judging the characters, as it really only portrays Jobs as he was."
4,"Cheesy, but interesting","After watching this movie, I went to the ""Oz"" site (the hippy with red hair in the movie that works with Steve) and read his review and comments on this movie. He said that this movie was pretty dead on and that the directors did their research very well. He also mentioned that he didn't even know about this movie until it was released and he saw it! Jeez... He said there were very very few falsehoods about what he saw in the movie. However, there are a few, just like every other movie.This movie is a bit cheesy at times. I liked it overall. I'm not completely sure that Bill Gates was so sneaky and disgusting as he was in this movie, but that's how I picture him, so I think the movie did a great job at showing Bill as I picture him! :-)Plus, it really is a bit nostalgic too... Fun to look back at those times."
5,My favorite movie of all time!,This movie was incredible. It really shed light on two people that I consider to have shaped the world we live in today. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are by far two of the most interesting people alive today and by far the most creative. As far as the movie being historically accurate it seems fairly dead on. I have read many books/articles on or by both people and the movie seemed to be on target. You probably could not have picked better actors to cast in these roles either! I give it an A+.
5,Mac's Back.....Tada,XLNT background of the early years. I'm sure that people who are finally getting fed up with the PC world will have a lot of fun with any of the Apple's. The movie is a must see.
2,Longest Microsoft commercial I have ever seen!,"This movie had to be secretly directed by Bill Gates. Gates is portrayed as inteligent, kind, resourceful, hardworking, a business genius, and even wild and crazy. Jobs on the otherhand is given no redeeming qualities what-so-ever (Darth Vader school of personel management). I'm not saying Gates isn't intelligent--he's certainly been successful, but this film is so completely one sided that it ruins what might have been an above average TV movie."
4,very entertaining,"This movie gives an entertaining and informative view of how both microsoft and apple started. it is amazing that in such a short time since this movie was released, how things have changed so much!"
1,"GREAT ALBUM, BUT YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG VERSION!","The Japanese imports of the Doobie catalog are remastered.Warner Brothers here in the U.S. is still selling the old LP-EQ'd, terrible-sounding masters they released on CD in 1990.If you love these albums, get a set of the Japanese editions. They cost more, but they're worth it.Here is the link to the Japanese remaster ofStampede."
3,"Okay, but I've heard this before","First, the price is a little rough.. for 4 songs. The songs are good, though. Matt Sharp seems to be going for a more mature and introspective sound since his days with the Rentals and Weezer. The songs are very dark. No light pop songs here. To describe what the songs sound like brings to mind one band - Wilco. The songs are incredibly similar to the sound of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Not that it is a bad comparison. Its just not cutting any ""new ground""."
1,did not fit on my Dyson,This unit may not fit onto your specific Dyson vacuum. Since it did not fit on mine - I down-rated it.
3,Too strong for it's own good.,"First of all, the amount I paid for a Dyson, this add-on should have come with it. However, as a separate purchase, I would only recommend this brush if you are crazy about cleaning appliances such as I am (I'm seeing a therapist,jk). Anyway, as for the performance; the brush sometimes works too well. The large size is excellent in reducing the amount of time it takes to clean a large area, however the strong suction sometimes causes the brush to stick to the cleaning surface. That's fine when I'm vacuuming the dresser, but not when I'm vacuuming the LED tv. By the way, regardless of what the descriptions say, do not use a vacuum to clean your expensive electronic devices."
1,useless,"the round brush included with dc23 is much better and has more suction, this one has two holes into the bristles that are so soft it can hardly remove dust, a waste of money"
1,Pure Trash,"Fortunately I only spent $3 on a used LP version, and I did it out of pure curiosity. When I put this on I could not believe two supposedly creative and experimental musicians could come up with such 80's trash."
1,"Poor introduction to the blues, poor teaching technique","As a beginning guitar player interested in the blues, I made the mistake of purchasing this as my second instructional book. I found it extremely frustrating to try to learn from.I didn't care for the songs - I felt like they were very oversimplified (and dissatisfying to play), and the book was far too rushed in terms of the blues theory it introduced.Now, as an advanced beginner, I have subsequently purchased the FAR BETTER book _Blues You Can Use_, which I highly recommend as a blues instruction book. Check it out instead of this one.I periodically re-open this Blues Guitar book to see if I can get anything from it, as my skills advance. As I looked at it tonight, and played some of the music, I remembered why I never liked it to begin with!"
3,Really Good,This is a really good book if you want to learn the fundamentals of Blues style guitar. Not really a guitar beginner's book though. I gave it three stars instead of four because the pages are so small it makes reading a little difficult. But the price for this cd/book can't be beat.
3,good service but need better packaging,"the book was received in a good, timely manner at a cheap priceat a fraction of the cost of a new book, i am doing all my assignments and learning more about vbthe only thing that would need improvement is packaginga cd came along with this book but since the packaging was done in an envelope it was broken in half which has prevented me from doing work at homeotherwise, this is a good seller and would deal with them again if they improve their packagingthanks"
5,Occupy Handbook,I first read this book in the late 1970's. It was a wonderful manifesto on how to thwart corporate greed. As I look at the Occupy this-n-that I think back to how this book would have helped the movements.
1,Unoriented,I thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot. Also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable.
3,"Great design, but too hard to keep clean","Everything fits and it looks great for a while, but it is too hard to keep clean. Scrubbing between each piece is difficult and if not done, you're left with moldy stains from the water."
5,Best bib yet,"The t-shirt is cute but the bib is great! Easily wipes clean (so I can use it for more than one meal a day), covers more of my 10-month-old than infant bibs but the neck opening and overall size are more comfortable for him than toddler bibs."
3,Nice Book for Young Adults,I enjoyed the story and the writing. The ending was too easy and predictable. Kind of a life lesson on happiness and loss.
5,I HEAR A SONG AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL,"When a movie gets made of Whale Song ... and it will ... I won't be surprised if the character of Sarah has a halo over her head the whole movie. This is a deeply stirring novel ... and one that proves Cheryl Kaye Tardif to be one of the finest Canadian novelists ... if not one of the most sentimental and observant human beings. Be ready to be moved. And be ready to hear what nature says to us ... will you? ... then become a better human.Todd Sentell, author of Toonamint of Champions: How LaJuanita Mumps Got to Join Augusta National Golf Club Real Easy"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I read and loved ""The River"" and now I can truly say I enjoyed another book by Ms. Tardif. ""Whale Song"" is a book about a child who went through a lot of change and loss for her young age. I found it touched my emotions enough to bring tears to my eyes during part of this child's loss. A little embarrassing since I was in public at the time. I highly recommend this book."
4,Whale Song,"This book is so sweet, it is very good. The cover is beautiful. Love the mystery of the ocean, especially whales."
4,A Good Read,"I downloaded it yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it! Believable characters, well-paced story, interesting cultural exchanges, human tragedy and triumph. A good read."
4,"For fans of 'A Wild Sheep Chase' and 'Dance, Dance, Dance'","It's shorter than I expected, (the book itself is about 5 x 3 inches, so good for a pocket, I suppose), but it's good Murakami. Offers some back-story on characters from Sheep Chase and Dance, and while nothing really mystical or surprising happens it's interesting to read through earlier work by the author. It struck me that his protagonist, who is the same as in Sheep Chase and Dance, is, like the author, much younger and with very different priorities than in the later works. He also has a different outlook, seems more human and vulnerable (not quite as Sam Spade as the author's later characters) which again gives the reader an interesting glimpse of the author as a younger, less experienced author. The translation's not as great as his newer stuff, which I've read he translates himself, but hey, it's ""new-to-me"" Murakami, so who the hell's complaining?"
5,A Giant Step Forward,"Spiritual psychology has just taken a giant step forward. Steve Rother has identified twelve primary life lessons which, at a soul level, people choose to master through physical incarnation. By identifying the main and the secondary life lessons that a person is working through, the higher purpose of these can be appreciated and the lessons mastered.Spiritual matters tend to be beyond the understanding of academic institutions. While universities do teach the works of inspired pioneers like Jung and Maslow, they cut away their spiritual components, leaving only the mundane and materialistic parts. Spiritual psychology will take root and expand with or without institutional support. Initially, it will likely leave academia behind and become its own science.So, if you have the pioneering spirit to become one of the early practitioners and researchers of spiritual psychology, remember this. The last frontier is not outer space. It's inner space!"
5,Thanks for the insight!,"I never met anyone who who was an astral-traveller, now I have. Mr. Ferguson showed up in my life in a miraculous way and we shared many touching stories and lessons. It just goes to show you that you can't judge a man by his 3-dimensional job... right, Jesus? Wow, being a postal carrier, could you imagine how many lives you could touch... what a fastinating journey to walk the earth AND other dimensions. I think this book is awesome because it shows us on many levels who we are and breaks down a large mysterious universe into a very easy to read and understandable text. I look forward to the new books Mr. Ferguson is writing!"
1,"Spend a little more, its worth it.","If you are the kind of person that loves to receive different products than you ordered, this is the place to get it. I ordered the usb/car charger combo and I received the car charger along with a second car charger for some random phone that I do not own. Since most of the money spent on this product is said to go to shipping, it is not even worth applying for a refund. So my advise is to spend the extra money at another store and get exactly what you want, not a package full of random junk."
5,Two thumbs up,"I have already read this book twice. That it has Captain Jack in it is a big plus. (How could you not like him?) Steve Lyons does a good job of depicting the Doctor and Rose. It's like watching the show, only better because you can take the book with you."
4,flatware holder,Although this does not come with a case it is an excellent product. I fits in drawers where a case would not fit. I am very pleased with this product.
5,Little trouble and Well Worth the Price,"My installation was rather painless, I had trouble twice, but I thought I could do it with only scanning the instructions. (I want to feel smart) I then read the instructions more carefully and was able to solve my problems.It says in the instructions not to place the Access Point close to any device(s), which emit radio waves. This includes Radios, Monitors, TVs, etc. And preferably Line of sight. But as you know line of sight isn't the easiest thing to do. And this applies to any Access Point or wireless networking device.Once I got the network up and running I was able to obtain a ""Very Good"" connection on the other side of my 5-bedroom home. I would highly recommend this product to people who have kids, like myself, and you want them to be able to access the internet from the other side of the house, but don't want to run the expensive wires."
5,Works Perfect with my DI-704 Cable/DSL Router,I plugged this into my DI-704 by D-Link and now I have Wired and Wireless Network Capabilities. Once I got my Wireless adapter for my Laptop I was in heaven. It was rather simple to set-up the Access Point and the PC card. Basically just follow the instructions. Again D-Link keeps me coming back because of their superior products.
1,Hard to install even with same brand components,"It says in the quick install guide to just plug the unit. No configuration is needed if you are networking with other d-link products. Sorry but it's not that simple.I spent the last 3 hours trying to configure it and still not works. The AP Manager don't recognize it and when configuring it manual, the MAC number gives me problems.Right know I'm writting to d-link support for advice. :( I just wish the installation could be easier."
2,Nice product but NO technical support,After fiddling with the unit for a couple of nights I finally got it to work. It would not auto detect and I had to enter the MAC address and IP address manually. I tried to call technical support and gave up after 30+ minutes on hold. They had NO help on their web site for that model and my e-mails were left unanswered. When I tried the built in help I was told my computer does not have the proper language installed. So we will wait for the Cisco unit due out in a few weeks. I know they have support available.
5,Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol,"Excellent telling of ""The Christmas Carol"" Doctor Who style, with an excellent vocalist from England whose rendition of the theme song is trilling to the core!"
3,Only remotely related to its namesake.,"So far, this Christmas special is the best of the new Doctor Who series, perhaps thanks to Michael Gambon's appearance. I'm not crazy about the new Doctor, played by Matt Smith, but then David Tennant's Doctor is a hard act to follow."
5,High Quality and Awesome poduction,"I remember this movie, it was aired on the WB. High Quality and Awesome poduction. It is a teenage flick and you just get pulled in by everything!I can't wait to order this DVD, watch it, and know that I was there! Get this DVD and enjoy the same experiences that I loved so much!"
1,can't even watch the tape,My tape was so bad that I can't even watch it to decide if I like the movie or not. Constant scrolling of film that we just cannot adjust. Makes the film unwatchable. Probably too late to return for replacement or credit.
2,The Phantom,"Tom Tyler, who stars in the best serial ever made, The Adventures ofCaptain Marvel, dons the purple spandex in this early version of LeeFalk's ""Ghost Who Walks"". The Phantom is one of the mostintriguing comic characters ever, a legendary jungle hero who thenatives believe to be immortal because he continues to exist forcenturies. Actually, the Phantom is really human; being replaced bydescendents of the original Phantom who donned the suit to avenge hisparents' death at the hand of pirates. Tyler looks great in theoutfit, and the jungles scenes look pretty good, but thisunfortunately is a typical Columbia serial; weak story and not one ofmy favorites. The only thing intriguing about this one is that itremained unreleased for years, and only available to privatecollectors who sold it at a premium to rabid fans of the Phantom.However, if you are a Phantom fan, then for $ bucks, you gotta haveit just to see the dude in the suit."
2,Lightening strikes twice,"So before i ordered this toy I did indeed read the only review this item had. The woman said for her 4 year old son had easily taken off the arms. I thought""well he was probably rough on it"" So I found it for REAL cheap and ordered it. Sure enough. When it arrived, the right arm was off and sliding around in the unopened box. The thing didn't even make it through transit. Luckily the seller on Amazon was great about it, but wow this is a very cool looking but unfortunately very flimsy toy indeed.I would HIGHLY recommend you steer clear of this thing unless you want your figures to be mangled and tore up."
4,Motivating and well presented,After reading Brenda's ex-husbands book I had to hear her story. It was great to read about Brenda's problems and not only focusing on her husbands betrayal.This book was written very well. It gives anyone in this situation an example to look at. This book does not push the reader to join sides with Brenda nor does it bash her husband. Well done and very informative.
4,Good tunes,"A bit ""'80's"" but still good stuff. ""Boomtown"" and ""Swallowed by the Cracks"" are the two stand out tunes."
4,It worked like it should,"I bought this hard drive after going through a LaCie and three from Western Digital. All had one problem with connecting it to the computer or stopped working. This Maxtor HD was the only one that has work without any problem. The recovery program works but is complicated and I still have not figured it out. Since it does work though I do not have a pressing need to figure it out. For me this hard drive worked, it might not work for you, my experience make me feel that the portable hard drives are a crap shoot so do not rely on just one to keep your information."
1,Why waste your money?!?,"This is probably the last machine I see Microsoft putting out. All the rushing to put this out 6 months or more before the PS3.The only thing the Xbox had going for it was the hard drive.I have both the PS2 and the Xbox and the Xbox 360 will be a let down if you buy it.You have to spend $300 on the console and then you have to spend $100 on the hardrive.To play games online you need to have a subscriton. So just to get started your looking at $600.Then games which ar $10 to $30 more than PS2 and hoepfully PS3 games.The biggest thing to watch for is that this console wont be supported by most of the big game manufacturers.The big game titles may put their games on this system after they release it for the PS3 when it comes out.So if you buy this it will be an investment that will only last till the PS3 is out then most people, game producers, and advertisement will go to the PS3.Then you have a $600 dollar paperweight."
5,Awesome Speakers,These speakers are great. Very good sound quality in both treble and bass. I don't know if I received a newer model than one of the other reviewers but mine did have a headphone jack on them....
1,Raising quail paperback information,"This paperback is NOT a paperback, but a brochure from the extension service. It gives some information for raising quail. This brochure can be ordered from GQF Catalog for $4.40 brand new. Postage was EXTREMELY high for this brochure."
3,Great product - horrible packaging by Amazon,"I was shocked at the haphazarded shipping approach taken by Amazon in packaging this hard drive, and have to give the product a rather low score based on that alone. Rather than a manufacturer's box within a shipping box with styrofoam peanuts or some such intelligent method, the drive arrived poorly suspended by feable styrofoam end caps (one which had worked its way loose) in a thin cardboard box that was a lttle mashed. The product documentation lay at the bottom of the box along with the power supply and connecting cables. Luckily the hard drive worked as advertised, but I have never, ever experienced such shoddy shipping by anyone. I would never expect this from Amazon. What gives?"
4,Fantastic 80's Music,"The only reason why this release didn't receive 5 out of 5 stars is because it might not be for everybody. It is very 80's-ish in sound, but one of the best from that memorable decade. ""Hands To Heaven"" and ""How Can I Fall"" are 2 huge smash hits that will appeal to almost everybody who listens to them. ""Don't Tell Me Lies"" is a high-paced, well-vocalized song that's a pleasure to sing along with. ""All This I Should Have Known"" and ""Won't You Come Back"" are also 2 great ballads, with the former usually getting stuck in your head for a good time after listening. I recommend this album to anyone who likes 80's pop or if you're looking for a few fabulous soft-rock ballads."
5,Fascinating concepts,"I never dreamt that I would read a book about intelligent dinosaurs and not only enjoy it but find it thought provoking. Robert Sawyer certainly is the best science fiction writer today. Though I often don't agree with his ideas, the concepts are compelling and make you think. Sort of like Juan Rico in Starship Troopers who said his History and Moral Philosophy professor in high school had discussions that would wake you up in the middle of the night and make you think: What did he mean by that?The problems of leadership and acceptance of differnt ideas are central to the Fossil Hunter. Sometimes you can avoid death by standing still after studying the enemy. It is a terrific set up to the conclusion of trhe series. I highly recommend the entire Quintaglio series."
5,Functional,Please accept my apology. Previous review is an error. My problem with the Answering System is that the CPC function needed to be changed from A to B. I made the change and it is working perfectly. I also have a KX-T2100 and it is also working perfectly after troubleshooting its malfunction. I need a new tape. Thanks again for your guidelines and again I apologize.
2,No wonder she's only almost famous,"some of the beats are aite, but that is overshadowed by her utter lack of singing talent.....just about everysong on the album is sung off-key, and no she can't blame it all on being recorded for other songs"
1,EVERYTHING SOUND THE SAME,EVERY LAST SONG SOUNDS TOO SIMILIAR ITS SAD SHE SHOULD'VE NEVA CAME OUT WIT A FULL LENGTH CD ESPECIALLY A DEBUT AS BAD AS THIS ONE.
3,"lyrics are worth it, despite her being somewhat tone deaf","The beats are catchy and grow on you. For being her first cd, it could be worse. The lyrics and tunes are worth the money for the cd, or at least the effort to download it. She has talent, but its raw....she definetly needs work on tone and keys.But, is it just me or do some songs sound disturbingly similar to each other?"
2,UH NO,"WOW MAYBE THIS STUFF WOULD BE TIGHTER IF SHE COULD ACTUALLY SING. NOW I KNOW EVERYONE CAN'T BE A TRUE ""SANGIN' DIVA"", BUT WHOA. I'M NOT HATIN, AS I CAN ALWAYS GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE, & WHO EVER MIXED/ENGINEERED THE INFECTIOUS SONG ""UH OH"" WAS ON POINT & REALLY HELPED HER OUT & APPARENTLY MADE THE BEST USE OF HER ""SKILLZ"". OTHERWISE I'D SUGGEST MORE HELP BE GIVEN ON THE NEXT ALBUM VOCALLY, MELODICALLY, EVEN VIDEO PEFORMANCE WISE ( LIKE LOOK INTERESTED FOR ONE) ON THIS ALBUM SHE SEEMS TO SING THE WAY SHE LOOKED IN THE ""UH OH"" VIDEO... WITH OUT FEELING, ANIMATION, INTEREST.. PERHAPS EVEN NERVOUS & UNSURE. I SINCERELY HOPE THAT WITH TIME, SHE WILL FIND HER ""NICHE""... OR WHATEVER THE NEXT GO AROUND. A GOOD SINGER MIGHT HAVE MADE THIS ALBUM WORTH PURCHASING."
1,This has to stop !,"What is going on in the music industry? Can't anyone see that Lumidee can't sing, I mean really SING ? Catchy beats are not enough for me to make her an artist. Her voice has a very limited range and all the songs sound alike. Don't waste your money on this one, don't even accept it as a gift unless it's the instrumental version."
1,C'mon are u kidding?,"There's nothing fresh about this. Her lead single is ""Get Busy"" Part II. I wonder if anyone realizes its the same exact beat as Sean Paul's Get busy and similar to Wayne Wonder's ""No Letting Go. Then she does a remix of it for Get Busy Part III. Nothing good going on here. Look elsewhere."
2,C'mon Lumidee,Well like everyone else I bought this cd for the club banger Never Leave you (uh oh). Boy was I pretty disapointed when I got this cd.The only other good song on here is Honestly. Don't get me wrong the beats are hot but her voice just doesn't go along with the flow.I like Lumidee's voice and I think that she should ''Dust herself off and try again''(quoted from the best female r&b singer ever) and maybe she could pull off a hit.
5,This thing rocks!!,"I was being cheap using the baking soda + hot water method to get rid the tarnishes off my silver jewerly.....that was a waste of time!! After trying 5 times, I decided to give up and I went on Amazon and bought this products and it WORKS!!! I mean the tarnishes came right off!! I am so pleased and my silver jewerly sparkles again!! Love it!!"
4,Diversified and Beautiful,"This is a great collection of diverse music. Plenty of unknowns who show off their skills of imagination, creativity, and originality. a joy to experience when letting the sound hit home. Let your ears do the traveling, when you are lifted in rhythm and melody. indigenous instruments and eclectic syncopation, all intertwined with palpable arrangements that include dub, chillout, downtempo, ambient, electronica and reggae, while of course 'world beat' prevails throughout. if you like percussion, melody, cultural ethnicity, and production mastery, this is a great buy!"
2,Bad connection interface,"TI never made any improvement using the serial port connection, hardware or software. Need to do a lot of fiddling with the computer before getting the device to connect. But if you desperate, you need to buy this, just because there's no substitute."
1,Very disappointed!,"I shopped carefully to replace our long-used and worn-out tub pillows. I thought it would be worth the higher price to get these for appearance and comfort. They were disappointing in many ways. One had a suction cup that inverted and would not stick right from the start, the other developed a leak at a seam after just a few uses. Once inflated, they are very much smaller and not that comfortable. The green color is pretty, but so was Virginia Mayo (for those of you old enough to recall that TV Guide review). Pretty flat, pretty uncomfortable, and pretty bad purchase, far outweigh it's appearance. They were a waste of time and money!"
2,Backlight failed,"I really like this watch for its functionality: water resistant, easy to read clockface, sturdy band - but less than 3 months of use, the backlighting (Indiglo) completely gave out."
2,"Eazy, you lost all of your cool points (My NAme is O.I)","This album was stupid. The only thing good about it was the song On Ya Chin, but don't be fooled, I like it cause of the tune and beat. Eazy's lyrics are not only sexually explcit, but corny as heck. My Baby'z Mama, was the dumbest song I ever heard. Old School (...) wa stupid like a mug. I like the beat and tune, though. I show respect for Eazy, because he died. But if he was still alive, I would have told him all his albums are stupid, and corny, and his dis to Death Row, was weak as paper, while a year before, Dre totally humuliated him in Dre Day (good song, by the way.) Anyway, R.I.P, Eazy-E."
3,Works for my daughter,"My daughter (16 months) would probably give this book five stars, but I find it boring other than being able to squirt water out the whale's spout at the end. I much prefer Sandra Boynton's ""Bath Time"" with the honking nose at the end, it's more fun to read aloud. I think my daughter prefers the vivid color of this one. Great for the whole bath collection and for variety, but if you only have room for one, I'd say get ""Bath Time"" first for your own sanity."
5,The last press I'll have to buy,"Heavy, well made, attractive and effective. I use it several times a week. I don't have to put it in the dishwasher - just rinse it out with hot water and it comes clean. A friend of mine used it the other night when helping me prepare dinner and said she'd buy one for herself and one for her daughter."
4,"Nice, but not so easy to squeeze","I went from no garlic press to this one so it surely made life easier. But if you use more than one medium clove, the press is almost impossible for my average lady hands to squeeze. But this utensil will last a long time, and is very easy to clean (a big plus)."
1,There are much better brands,"It's big and clunky and it doesn't mash garlic very well. It leaves lots of garlic in the hopper instead of pushing it through the mesh. I have other garlic presses that work much, much better than this one. I gave my OXO away."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I purchased the Oxo based on the many positive reviews. The heft/weight of this unit is very helpful when pressing un-peeled garlic - however.....The construction tolerances are such that an over abundant amount of garlic squeezes out the sides and is lost. I found similar results from the Kuhn-Rikon unit too (see my review). Overall, the best garlic press I've found in the Zyliss unit for shear efficiency and the amount of actual garlic moved through the press and useable for cooking. The Oxo unit is average, Kuhn-Rikon poor, and the Zyliss about the best available."
4,Works like a champ,"The first thing you notice is that this has a nice weight to it, not some cheap plastic. It matches all the other appliances i have, but beyond aesthetics its preforms great. I put a clove in and crush it a little then take it out to peel the skin after that throw it back in and press again and the garlic comes right out of the press. Easy to clean too, just turn your faucet on high and it will clear out the crushed remains. Great product."
5,Nice Garlic Press,The stainless steel garlic press was reasonably priced and very functional. The OXO stainless steel garlic press made a nice Christmas gift for a family member.
1,curse it every time I use it,"The plastic and metal handles slip off almost every time I use it, and water gets caught in the space under these coverings on cleaning, resulting in dish water dripping out on next use."
3,major design flaw,"As far as pressing garlic goes, this item cannot be beat. I've tried the ones from Kuhn Rikon, Rosle, and Zyliss; they don't come close to ease of use.However, I can't understand why Oxo didn't design the handles in a single piece rather than slipping on a second external layer. Water seeps in when cleaning, and getting the external handle casings off in order to drain it is both difficult and annoying.I had given this item five stars at first; now that I've had it for a while, the design flaw is irritating enough to warrant a downgrade in rating."
2,not impressed,"I've had this product for about a year and aside from the water coming out of the handle, it began to corrode after only a few uses. I would not recommend this item for someone who minces garlic frequently ( i do about 5 times a week)."
5,Best garlic press I've tried...,"I've tried 3-4 other garlic presses, with varying degrees of satisfaction, and this one is easily the best. What's great about it is (1) the heavy hinge and the built in cleaning mechanism make it dead simple to clean, and (2) it feels very heavy and well built -- it has a great feel to it. I definitely recommend this, even if you already own a garlic press."
5,Garlic Press,Product arrived on time and in good condition. I have used this several times now and find it much easier to use than a previous press that didn't have cushioned handles. This is much more comfortable to use if you are pressing several cloves of garlic. Does a very good job of mincing the garlic cloves. Easy clean up.
1,Not impressed,"I didn't like this video workout - it wasn't consistent in keeping you moving, it was more instructional dance. I didn't care for it, neither did my daughter, who I bought this video for as a Christmas present."
5,A FANTASTIC WAY FOR ANY PATS FAN TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON,"This is simply essential viewing for any Pats fan. I am a lifelong Pats fan from the UK and DVDs are a great way for me to relive the season from foreign shores. This amazing collection has it all, the games, the behind the scenes stuff, the interviews and all the play analysis too.There is so much stuff on here besides the Super Bowl itself, it would be a truly miserable pats fan who couldn't be satisfied with the range of content in this double DVD box. you really feel like you can relive the moment of glory from Super Bowl XXXIX from start to finish, the playoffs, the build up, training days, locker room footage, the victory parade in Boston, the ring ceremony, just everything is included in this massive set.A perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon in the off-season. I guarantee you will feel the way i did if you're a Patriot fan.....smiling from ear to ear and full of pride at the happy memories. An excellent buy for any Patriot."
3,I wanted more from this video.,"I really wanted more from this video, speaker's weren't so clear as for an International english movie, scientific documentation, pictures, movie, may be better and, cold and poor Tesla's movie representation. Historical facts were Ok but poorly representated in the video. At near future I will buy other Tesla's videos to get mi opinion wider about this but now I prefer ""The Secrets of Nikola Tesla""."
5,The ultimate work on this subject! Excellent,"The most complete reference book about the RN I have never seen. When you own this book you do not need reading anymore about the Royal and Commonwealth Navies, because all the relevant informations can be found in this super reference book. Lots of data, very fine photographs, details concerning even the smallest craft (and this can be seen by someone as a fault). Just to pick holes Lenton could insert sections dealing with naval ordnance, mines, radar and so on. But anyway his work is an excellent one: a must-have book for the naval enthusiast's shelf."
4,Great Textbook,"This is a very well written textbook. One of the best. Clarity, examples, and a good supplemental workbook that accompanied the main text.great book for mba's."
1,Horrible book...,"I hate this book. It spreads one problem over several pages so you have to go back and search for the original information for the problem that is scattered over several pages. This book refuses to just give the equations in a straightforward manner... you have to figure that out on your own as well. I had to buy three other textbooks, Standard Deviants DVDs and Cliffs Notes just to understand the material because the book was NO help at all. The book will only show you one type of example, but then the HW problems ask you to solve what the book did not show or explain. Example: The example in the book illustrates how to perform annual compounding but does not explain or demonstrate other types of compounding such as monthly, then the HW problem will ask you to solve a monthly compounding problem, when the textbook itself never explains how to do this. Horrible book."
1,Find another finance book,This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach! Brigham & Company will take 30 pages to explain a concept that can be done in 2 pages. I used this book for my finance class for my MBA; this one is not worth the money or your time.
5,Great dryer,"This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotnessyou would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does geta little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easilywatch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!"
2,hair dryer,"this hooded hair dryer a reasonable price now I know why, it is noisy and the air flow is too weak ,it takes too long to dry regular length hair I finished up drying my daughter's hair with a hand held hair dryer!"
3,Good for the price,"I really didn't expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price."
3,My Take,"I would say it's a three pont five instead of a three. As long as you sit in the right chair and use the right table, it's not too bad, and have plenty to do. I got this to free my hands for other things sometimes, and I'm going to use it more now that it's recommended over hand-held dryers because it's less damaging to hair. I just have my hair down instead of rollers for faster drying, but going to start wrapping my hair so it won't be as frizzy. It takes about an hour to dry my hair. I'm sure it would be about the same if I used an 1875 wattage one. I would recommend it if you have the patience to sit under a dryer and have things to occupy your time with."
3,it's ok...kind of,"i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair....i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago...they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....which is what this one does...i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this...so ill keep it...it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug....."
5,Exactly what i needed,"These fit perfectly on my 1980 K20 Chevy Silverado, it came with the races (wish i would have known that before i bought the races) but none the less i was very happy with the purchase especially the price 120 for anywhere else 60 from amazon (WOOOO!)."
5,This keyboard Rules!,"The IBM/Lenovo ""Thinkpad"" keyboard is very useful in many environments. I use it for PC builds and repairs. I only need one USB plug and I am fully ready to go. I also don't need to reach over to get the mouse.I use if for everyday computing. Very effecient because I don't have to move my hands from the keyboard.I so love these keyboards."
5,Nice little keyboard.,"I am a fan of keyboards with a short keystroke, and this one fits the bill. I am using it on my desktop, and it's nice to have the same keyboard as my thinkpad. The touchpad and trackpoint work well although I also use a mouse. The only complaint I have is that the USB cable is too short to reach my tower under the desk, so I had to put an extension on it. The keyboard comes with a nice soft case. I just wish I could find something to use it for, because this keyboard never leaves my desk."
2,Not really relevant to me,"I have been struggling with thyroid problems all of my adult life and buy just about anything that looks like it will give me information.This was not a helpful book. There was alot of research but none of it seemed current. I left the first few chapters feeling like the book was useless to me because I don't have the resources to get to this doctor and even if I did - he doesn't accept any sort of insurance!Maybe if I had stuck with it, I would have gotten more out of it, but the tone of the whole book just rubbed me the wrong way."
5,Nice first game,"My daughter likes to play this. The rules are simple, the game is attractive and durable. The game also goes quickly, which works for the short attention span crowd. She did try to taste a few peices though."
3,"It was a little less than I expected, but the quality is nice.",It is a cute game and kids seem to like it. I think it is a bit basic and I guess I was wanting a little more.
5,Jonathon the Impaler is a Documentary Filmmaker's dream!,"Rarely does a Documentary Filmmaker ever come across a subject as fascinating as Jonathon ""The Impaler"" Sharkey.Minnesota had its share of celebrity politicians. Al Franken and Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura are fine examples, but neither can light a candle to the Satanic Vampire who ran for Governor of Minnesota in 2006.But as interesting as Sharkey's political career was, it was his personal life that ""sucked"" me in.To me, the characters involved in his life were equally as interesting. I could tell you more, but that would ruin the story.You can watch Impaler on Hulu, but I'd highly suggest picking this bad boy up for the extras and commentary.It's worth the buy.Also, if you watched Impaler and enjoyed it, you'll be happy to know that a follow up film is on the way.It's called Impaled: Painfully Blunt!Trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f9UgmXoXPQ"
5,Nice and functional,The certificates came in a very good time frame. They were very nice and the certificates I ordered fit nicely within them without too much fuss with the little flaps that hold the certificate (which held them securely by the way) in the holder. Very professional looking.
3,Good book but practice questions poor...,"The ""Server+ Certification Bible by Trevor Kay"" is a good review to acquire the basis but the final test and the boson test are not adapted to the actual exam. I take the comptia server+ exam today, and i failed : only 59 %. My thinking about the exam: whouuuu it is hard , more ambiguous ,and less technical than the network+ or inet+!"
2,Serious Errors Found,"There are some serious errors in the text AND the Questions and Answers. Please be careful if you are using this book. If something doesn't sound right, look it up in another location."
1,Get Coriolis,"I am Network+, i-Net+, and A+ certified and had previously used Coriolis books on the exam. It lacks any sort of proofreading, and even some of the questions in the book and the CD are wrong after I had to lookup answers to make sure. There are erroneous spelling and technical mistakes. I thought I would give Mr. Kay a try....don't be an idiot like me, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK. Stick with Coriolis or Sybex."
2,What a poor excuse for a certification book,"This book did NOT cover all the topics on the Server+ exam. I did pass my exam, but not thanks to this book. This book covers some topics such as RAID levels in great detail, while ignoring other topics such as the OSI model (which is covered on the test in part) altogether. Please, do not waste you money on this one. Go buy Mike Myers Server+ guide or the Exam Cram one. Both do a much better job then Trevor Kay's book."
5,I enjoyed using this book!,"This is one of the best books out there on the market.Yesterday I passed the exam. I studied in the evenings after work for about a 3 weeks, and I used only this book and some free online practice test questions. 5 very well deserved stars for Mr. Kay!"
2,Too many ERRORS,"At one time there were some reviews here that detailed some of the many errors in this book. The errors were both technical (some were typos, but some where just incorrect information) and errors in grammar. Most errors in grammar are easily ignored, but there are so many in this book that they became a distraction to studying the material. However, the technical errors are much more likely to cause problems if you are using this book to study for the Server+ exam. Especially, the errors in the question and answer parts of the book (and there are many)."
5,Ah... Cleo Laine,"This is a rich collection of Cleo's best. If you listened to good music in the 70's, this was on your list. And... it is not just a few songs, but a good evening from one of the best. Yes."
3,Great everyday watch,"What a great looking, inexpensive watch!!!I have this exact same watch, but the black version with a black face and black leather band. I really wish I had seen this green version though, I like it MUCH better. I've had it for about three years and it still looks great but the band is starting to show a little wear. The quality of the leather on the band is surprisingly good given the price of the watch. I saw some others say the band is stiff, which it is when it is brand new but when it is broken in, it will conform to your wrist. I've got many compliments on this cheapie Timex.So why only three stars? The Indiglo feature stopped working about 8 months ago for no reason at all. It can't be the because of the battery because the watch still keeps perfect time."
1,Oxford book of English verse,With out an index totally uselessI would have paid for a volume I could have usedThis is not a book you would read like a novel
2,This makes my Dell Laptop freak out!,"I bought this wireless card new and it worked well for a while and suddenly I began having problems with my mouse and my sound during broadband streaming. I unplugged it in and grabbed another wireless card and the problems disapeared. I thought my drivers or my hardware had gone bad. I would choose another card like the netgear one, which is what I will be buying to replace this hunk of junk."
1,Crashing W2000 Every Time,"I use a Toshiba Portege 7000 series with Windows 2000. This card crashes my computer (yes, W2000 not W ME) every time I install it or boot up with it. Combined with my poor experience with the D-Link D713 P wireless router and the third-party support organization (SupportConcept), I cannot recommend D-Link products."
1,Simply stay away from this product,"Continually crashes my Win2000 server (first time getting the blue screen on Win 2000). Called tech support. Don't be fooled by the first immediate response. Held up for about 1hr. Had to drop because the call isn't free!. Well, I did figure out the driver that crashes my machine. I found out that Linksys has a recent upgrade version of same driver. So, I replaced it with Linksys driver and everything seems to be ok. But whenever I loose signal for any reason, I would always have to reboot my server!My advice... stay away for these reasons: 1. Poor tech support 2. tech support not free 3. Outdated driver 4. Driver not compatible with Win2000 adv. server"
1,"What a POS - for the love of God, get a Orinoco Gold!","What a waste of hard-earned money. Whoever designed this should be tarred and feathered! Not worth $half the price of a good card. I don't know how many public places it keeps [failing] in... at school, Starbucks, libraries, etc... Greatest problem ----- keeps disconnecting, then connecting, then disconnecting (1 minute it says connection ""Excellent-11Mbps"", a second later ""Low signal or No Connection"" all while I'm sitting at the same seat/table! Very very annoying... Glad I have a XP OS, my friends with DELLS in Windows 2000 just LOVE it when they have to type in the SSID every freaking time they go to a new place. Too bad Amazon.com doesn't have a 0 star rating for this product, it deserves it. As you see from my name, this looked like a hot deal, but the only thing that got hot was my temper."
2,Fails in most important respect - signal strength,"I agree with the reviewer who is having signal strength problems. In my house this D-Link card gets very low to non-existant signal. A computer next to it, with a Lucent Orinoco card gets full signal. I've tried moving them around and the Lucent consistently out-performs the D-Link. If you have an open plan room for your installation then no problem the D-Link works just fine, but if there are a few walls in the way, then buyer beware, not all cards are created equal."
3,Just beatiful but..........,"The smell is intoxicating.........I love soft powdery scents and this is one of them but unfortunatley it only lasts for around one hour and that is pushing it! Yes, I have the EDP, I was quite frankly shocked that it was so week for being an EDP. The economy is getting pretty bad and so is the quality of the perfume out there, BUYER BEWARE!"
1,LARGE wine brush will break your glass,"The is not a wine brush. It could be used to clean your tiolet it is so large. Please do not buy it and think you can clean your wine glasses with it. You would be better off with a baby bottle brush...that's what we use. The picture they use must be either, a small brush or a very large wine glass, because it is very difficult to force this large brush into your wine glass and then there is the breaking that follows of course..."
3,disapoited,Was disapointed overall but did have some useful info. Wasn't worth the price would be a good buy at less than $20.
4,a great book,"This is a great book,however I did find some errors.On page 223 the author states that all OE 5 liter cams have five 2.081 inch diameter bearing journals.Sorry,all 5 liter cams have five different size cam bearing journals as stated in my official Ford Mustang shop manuals from 1989,1972 and 1966.Page 209 states that oversize valves up to 1.94""intake will work with OE notched pistons,while page 212 says valve reliefs in 87-93 production pistons will accomodate 2.02""intake valves.Which spec is correct?Page 32 and 268 states that the 83-85 dual snorkel air cleaner was used on mid eighties 429-460 v-8`s.1973 was the last year for the 429.And finally,the OE roller cam specs on page 228 don`t make sense to me.If the revised E8ZE-CA cam for late 1988 handicaps the engine by three horsepower compared to the original E5ZE-AA cam,why does the revised cam have better specs?"
1,Do NOT Waste Your Money!!,"My daughter got this present for her birthday. She opened it with anticipation. I followed all the directions, adding batteries first,and then turning the unit on prior to the next step. The instructions said to tune the wirelss microphone to 100.1 FM. I did that and there was already a radio station at the same 100.1 FM location. The mic didn't work. In the ""fine"" print it said, ""Mic may not work in REMOTE areas where there is already a radio station at 100.1 FM"". HA!!! We live in the #3 largest city in the USA and trust me, it doesn't work in the big city either. A total waste of MONEY. Please don't waste yours on this thing...!!"
3,Not my taste,"Having on of the biggest record collections in the Netherlands and a fan of Dave Grusin from the 60's, I have to say this record is only for a SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I spinned it several times but sorry to say I don't like this bodyless piano-playing.I drop this cd in the cellar."
5,Fascinating and Extremely Well-Written,"I really loved this book. I was impressed with how well done it was, since it is a first novel. The author has created a rich and unique world inhabited by interesting, fully developed characters. I completely lost myself in reading about Rani's difficulties and adventures. I was amazed at some of her actions, but she is a complex and very real character. She was, after all, a young person with strong beliefs and convictions who was manipulated by very bad people. I read mostly fantasies, and it is refreshing to read one which really does not try to mimic any of the standard or traditional plot lines. I can't wait for future books."
2,I have the worst luck buying books at airports...,"I picked up this book a few days ago on a trip up to Seattle. I have to say it took the first 150 pages to really get into the book, which is very technical in nature. Its obvious to me that Donald Harstad was a talented police officer in his previous incarnation. There was quite a bit of, in my opinion, useless dialogue that really seemed to be there to just fill pages. The story itself was at times intriguing but it tended to sputter out more often than not. A lot of the character development seemed wasted in the end which, in my opinion, was extremely anticlimactic. I hate to give this book such a terrible review because after all the lead-up I was really looking forward to a big payoff."
4,Lenny Henry is hillarious,"A fun series... at least it is until season 3 rolls around.The first two seasons are very well done. Filmed nicely, they sound good, and you just can't wait for the next rant from Gareth.Viewers may compare Chef! to Blackadder and Fawlty Towers... and many would be right in thinking that the other two series are superior, however, coming in third to Blackadder and Fawlty Towers is NO shame at all. In fact, it should be ranked up there with those series considering Gareth is every bit as sharp-tongued and ill-tempered a character as Edmund Blackadder and Basil Fawlty.The wonderful (and infectuous) music, pacing, characters, and general humor of the first two seasons gives way to fairly mediocre and by-the-numbers fare in the third season. It is not without it's charm, but definitely leaves you wanting the superior quality of the first two seasons.Look for the episode with the real Stilton... it's one of the best!"
5,Excellent Condition,I received the dvd's sooner than I had expected and they were in mint condition!!!! The Best!!!
5,a different twist on the protection program,"My sister-in-law loaned me a book written by Stephen White and I was hooked. I really like his books and this was no exception. It is a little different in that, instead of a criminal going into the protection program, a DA is placed in it to help protect her and her daughter from the man she placed in prison and who had her husband killed right in front of her eyes.Are the legal authorities really protecting her?She goes to a psychologist to help her get over the shock of her ordeal and unknown to those protecting her, she makes the acquaintance of another person in the program, only he is an enforcer or hit man.The psychologist and his wife, a DA herself, are major players in this book also. It is a book you don't want to put down until you have finished reading it."
4,Nodes of Ranvier,"This is Nodes of Ranvier's second full length album, which compared to the first album (Lost Senses, More Innocense) is blown out of the water. I'm not saying this album sucks, because it's a very good album, but what I'm saying is that the first album was so much better. Lost Senses, More Innocense contained some of the greatest, most intense hardcore vocals I've ever heard, but unfortunately the vocalist in that album is no longer in the band. Nodes of Ranvier is a Christian band, as all Facedown bands, and you can tell that by their lyrics of praise and humility. This album is still extremely awesome and intense, but i would still recomend trying to find Lost Senses, More Innocense first.xx"
5,What a Great Book,The book is clearly written with good illustrations and is a must for anyone who is new to catamaran sailing. I highly recommend it.
1,Totally dissapointing,"With all the good reviews around this movie, I expect a lot more. After watching it, it's a depressing movie with most of them are adulterers. Acting are not even a b movie, probably c movie?? I don't if it's the director or the actors/actresses? anyway not touching at all, not as interesting, no great sex scenes and of course, not a great story and message. Sorry.."
2,I didn't care for this book..2 stars is generous,"In fact, I wish I skipped it. Its nice the author documents his tradions. However, I felt like this didn't need to be a book, a conversation on the highlights would have sufficed. It was somewhat interesting to me but the information was not pursuasive enough to convince me that was the right way to approach crystals. I felt he contradicted himself a few times. I also felt he babbled somewhat. All in all, Im glad I didnt pay a lot for the book. I'm actually super surprised at how its gotten so many good reviews when there are books out there like The Book of Stones and Crystal Power, Crystal Healing; the latter being scientific. The only explanation I can come up with is that its an easy read and very accessible to a wide variety of people as it is very simple and lacks depth. As such, it doesn't really say much."
5,Great Book,Very informative. Learned things about crystals not mentioned in any other books I have. I recommend this book to anyone who's new to crystals or to anyone who already knows about them.
5,Good Condition,This book was the last to arrive and I haven't had a chance to really look at it. I kinda did a flip through and it looks to be very interesting.
5,Order Timberlands One Size Small.,Great product and a great price. You'll want to order one (full) size smaller than your normal shoe size.
3,Oversized,"I usually take a size 17, but these were very large on me, and very heavy and clunky, even for a guy with big feet. Also, their construction and design was very old-school, with flat-bottom soles and insole inserts."
1,Beware! Company not refunding for returned item,"The boots arrived and were lovely. However, they were too big for my husband, so I returned them approximately three weeks ago. I have sent the company several messages through Amazon inquiring about when my credit card will be refunded. However, I have yet to receive a response even though the company boasts a 48-hour policy of getting back to customers. Lucky for me I have the receipt and can place a dispute on this charge. Order from this company at your own peril and make sure you keep all copies of receipts."
5,Great lift the flap book,"My daughter (2 yrs old) loves this series of Little People Lift the Flap books. I love them because they are sturdy, the flaps are much harder to pull-off the page than some of the other books she has. And there are several (about 10 or so) flaps per 2-page spread. This book in particular covers numbers, shapes, colors, matching animals, and matching workers to their job. Its one of her favorites, and she loves flipping through it with someone and even by herself."
2,Passion Fish is Okay,"This movie has an interesting plot and acting that points toward why it won awards. However, it contains a very disturbing amount of profanity laced in that adds nothing to the story. Don't watch this movie with your young kids, unless you want them to hear the F-bomb dropped several times just to get the R-rating. The tobacco industry also advertises its cancereous cigarette products in few scenes. The movie ends abruptly without a satisfying conclusion to the storyline. It is like the director was planning to make a sequel. Ouch!"
3,Flawed beauty,"This is a beautifully filmed, splendidly acted, and intelligently written film, well worth watching. At the same time, the movie is overly long and the script contains more than a bit of soap opera. Most objectionable, to this viewer, was the low level of moral sensitivity exhibited by Sayles. There seems to be nothing higher in life than sex, even when it's with someone else's husband. Christianity is sneered at in the script, and there is blasphemy along with the much-used ""f"" word. At the end, one has the feeling that the two women lead characters will reach no higher goal in life than jumping in the sack with assorted men. Just the message this society needs!"
3,Perhaps the most comprehensive book on the subject,"This book often reads like a great adventure novel; however, at some points inthe story it can essentially be considered as such. This is a wonderful view into the world of the crystal skulls, and it is well worth the investment to anyone who chooses to work with these sacred tools. This is also a valuable book to any advanced stoudent of any application of crystals."
4,Fascinating,"Saw the movie ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and had no idea there were actual crystal skulls of mysterious origin. Somehow I ran across this book and figured I should read it.In a nutshell, it seems we have several crystal skulls around the world that nobody can explain how they were made. Hmmm, sounds a bit like the great pyramid(s) and other ancient structures. Lots of myths surround the skulls, attributes of healing powers, etc.An interesting read. Kinda wonder where the authors got the $$ to gallop around the globe to investigate the skulls."
3,Interesting but too wordy,This is a very interesting book but the writer is much too wordy asking too many questions before trying to answer them. I like the concept of the book but don't like the way it's written.
5,WOW!,"This book was great. If you like Lord of the Rings, you will love this thriller. So suspenseful! I recommend this to any young adult who wants a good thrill! AH! Good job Karl!"
5,Top of the line,Just what I expected from Buck. Perfect fit and finish; great design; quality steel; stays sharp. I use steel and then smooth leather to keep razor edge. Be careful skinning; easy to cut self in not paying attention. Skinned 4 deer before I touched up the edge.
5,Beautiful Ffowlin,"I saw this last year and couldn't get it out of my head. Not only is it funny, as many of the reviewers here have said, it is also very, very, sad. It tells some wonderful stories about chickens and the last one about the chicken who's chick is attacked by a hawk is quite moving. But, there is a dark side to this as well because it shows very clearly how human beings abuse and use chickens as pure commodoties.Watch this and you'll never feel the same about chickens again.And ignore the person who thinks it's mad - it's not mad, it's just that they don't understand."
3,Cute Chicken stories,"I bought this DVD for my mom after I had saw it on PBS, and thought it was an adorable documentary. It left me feeling fluffy and feathery inside.And no it is not the history of the chicken; it's just a set of seperate real life stories that all have a chicken or several hundred chickens in them."
5,Wonderful,"I picked this up at the library for my kids to watch... figuring they'd be watching a documentary about chickens and learning something.We were all very surprised with what this really is - a fabulous, interesting, funny, and tender story about how awesome chickens are.That was five years ago, and we have since bought the movie and it is still one of our family's favorites. (Who needs Hollywood when you have PBS?!)We have also, since watching this inspirational movie, bought a few chickens and love being chicken owners... but we don't have them in the house."
2,Title is Completely Misleading,"The title for this review says it all. This is not about the natural history of chickens, it's a short documentary of people telling stories of chickens they've owned, saw, or heard. It's not a bad watch if you want to watch a short quirky documentary about people who are familiar with chickens. It has precious little to do with chickens themselves and nothing to do with ""The Natural History of the Chicken."""
3,It is a decent item,"It does it's job but it is a bit expensive for plastic. I use it to dry my baby bottles and other baby accesories but I really don't know if it will hold up with real use (dishes, cups, etc...). Reason why I purchased it was because of its convenient size, fits perfectly above my minifridge."
2,Chop Chop!!!!,"This version (VCI) has been cut down/edited. I viewed this movie some years ago on either AMC or TMC cable networks. In the cable version, the scenes where Tonto is mobbed in town, by the gang, and then sends his horse (Scout) for help were much longer and exciting. A great fight scene and rescue scene have been left on the cutting room floor. What a shame. Where is the uncut version?"
3,Careful--This is not the special edition,"This is 1 disc, full screen only. The correct cover image is the one posted by Sandra Fox. The cover posted by Amazon is for the special edition 2 disc set, as are the rave reviews. I love it. Just wish I'd got the special edition, which is why I gave this 1 disc edition only 3 stars."
2,Thought was CD,I really thought this was a CD I was ordering. I was disappointed. I would really like to send back for a CD. I hope this is possible.
3,"High domed and attractive, drawbacks of silver hold it back","I purchased a Palladium ring elsewhere as my wedding band. I wanted something to wear when working with my hands, when damage to the ring is likely. I bought this, and a 5mm Stainless band. The stainless band is nicer for a few reasons. First, the silver color is beautiful but doesn't look like white gold/platinum/palladium, while the stainless looks very close. Second, the stainless is much more scratch resistant, this will scratch in the first five minutes you wear it. Third, the dome on this ring is very high which was uncomfortable for me. Fourth is that the silver is likely to react with some people's skin. I like the SS ring I also bought from Sabrina much better. If you want silver, this is it, but it wasn't what I expected."
4,great sterling silver ring,The ring arrived very fast and it was exactly what I ordered! Thank You very much!
2,2nd best,Tenth Anniversay Concert upstaged the Old London Cast. The Eponine in OLC has this annoying monotonous voice. It's all in high tune and more nasal. I can't understand what is she whining for for crying out loud. I cringe everytime I hear her singing. TAC has a better Eponine. Marius however will be the definitive one and irreplaceable. Javert and Fantine in TAC is better and as almost perfect but... the Fantine sounds so Regal that you wouldn't think she's poor. Voice wise 10th Anniversary Concert is truely a DREAMCAST.
1,Defective,"I ordered a CD as a Christmas gift. As my boyfriend was playing it it came to a long silence. There was a wide scratch on the disk. I returned it and ordered a replacement. This one had the same defect! Finally, I ordered a different recording of the same musical from another online store. It was fine."
5,The best of the lot...,Les Miserables is a brilliant musical and this is by far the best recording of the lot. It has none of the annoying accents or over indulgence seen in the other versions. If you're going to buy only one of the various recordings then make it this one!
3,Not Bad,"This is the first time I have listened to the original London cast. Oddly, it struck me as a work in progress. I enjoyed it, but vocally I was not as moved as I was in subsequent productions that came after it. Some of the emotions that went into the vocals weren't there as they were in later productions. Still, not bad. But I also recently saw the 25th Anniversary concert with Alfie Boe. That performance was spellbinding! As if it took some time for the ultimate performance to happen. Love this show! Looking forward to the movie!"
5,Excellent......if you haven't already heard another version!,"This is an excellent recording and is much more appreciated if you haven't already heard another version (Symphonic, OBC, TAC.) If you have heard the other versions I will GUARANTEE you will probably like them better. But if you are a completist and want to add a different piece of Les Mis to your collection - definitely get it. It gives you a view of the show IN ITS VERY EARLY STAGES and if you are interested in the changes from London to Broadway - get it!"
5,Memorable,"Would recommend to anyone who has a love of the play. I saw the movie recently and thought many of the vocals were better than the original, however the original is also a must listen to."
5,awsome!,"hey music fan from CA, isn't this cd just awsome! yeah, I was looking for the origalal lyrics to little people, too - it's one of my fav's. I agree, this cast has much more emotion in their voices."
4,Starving Pauper...,"Hey, music fan from Garrett Park, MD! I recognize your headline, from Forbidden Broadway 2! (Also a great disc.)"
4,Wonderful musical,"I am partial to the Broadway cast recording personally, because that was the one I came to know first. It is really amazing to compare the two, each one has at least one song that the other doesn't. This is a definite must for any Les Mis fan!"
1,"Great material, but seriously over-sung","One of the other reviewers said that Betty Buckley's vibrato was initially annoying, but then he realised the ""passion"" behind the delivery.Well, for me, I want to hear vocal technique supporting the emotion, not the other way around!!!These are wonderful, eclectic, challenging, and very ""adult"" songs. They need honest, respectful delivery - trusting in the ability of the song to tell the story, rather than having to accentuate every syllable's worth of emotion with ""technique"" and blatantly overwrought delivery.A major disappointment - I can only assume ""this was better live""..."
5,Ultimate Favorite Brow Liner!,"It lasts all day, looks au naturale, & lasts longer than the sephora brow liners! People compliment on my eyebrows and I just, love it."
2,I bought it in brown color and when I employed that I don't see any color.,I bought it in brown color and when I employed that I don't see any color. It's same no color.
2,What's going on?,"Where have the horses gone? Why have are bright, funny, HAPPY Saddle Club girls gone? They've changed to soap opera stars with crisis after crisis. They don't even seem to be friends anymore. I love(d) the Saddle Books (and own every...yes...every one of them) as I've read them since I was 11 (I'm 16 now). I hoped the Pine Hollow books would 'catch up' with me age wise. Howeverm just because you are an older teen doesn't mean your life is in pieces. Hopefully, Ms. Bryant will return some of the 'Saddle Club' spirit in Book 4."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!,SINCE WHEN DID CAROLE START TO DATE MOVIE STARS LISA MUST HAVE GONE CRAZY.SHE ALMOST FORGOT PRANCER AND STEVI IF SHE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WHY NOT TRY TO SEE YOUR HORSE HUH I WISH THAT YOU COULD RECONSDER THIS BOOK. OR CHANGE BACK TO HORSES.
3,GET WITH THE PROGRAM!!!!,What Happened????? Life is not a soap opera!! What happened to the horses??
2,This is sooooo fourth grade,"Okay, the fact that Lisa and the ""Saddle Club"" are still running around with and being chummy with ""famous"" movie stars makes me sick. Can we say unrealistic? This book reminded me of books I read in fourth grade. I mean, come on? Carole ""dating"" a star, Lisa considering dating a star. I can't see a difference in this series from the other one except that the Saddle Club can drive. This sould be called ""The Saddle Club After They Went Through Puberty and Got Drivers Licenses."" I gave this book two stars because Bonnie told us about Veronica, and a little about Maxi."
3,Actually liked it better than season 2,"While I love season one of ""Chef!"", I guess I'm the opposite of other reviewers, as I actually liked this better than season two, which bored me to death and was not funny at all. In fact, after watching season two, I wasn't expecting much when I moved on to season three. While it is definitely not as good as the first series, I thought it was funnier than the second. I agree that some aspects were depressing: Chef doesn't do much cooking, the whole divorce thing is a drag, and I hated some of the new characters--especially Savannah (? can't remember for sure if that was her name ?).Anyway, in my opinion, season one is definitely worth watching; season two is a bore; and season three is worth watching at least once."
3,Terror ode to old Hollywood.,"""Terror Night"" (also called ""Bloody Movie""). Standard horror set-up as a group of young adults provide the body-count after trespassing in old mansion. The film is given enough quirk and energy to sustain interest.Plot centers around ""Lance Haywood"" (John Ireland), former screen idol presumed dead. Haywood kills each person according to different film roles. Great cast includes John Ireland, Cameron Mitchell, Alan Hale Jr., Dan Haggerty, Jamie Summers in bubble bath, Michelle Bauer running around naked, and a body ripped in half during the opening minutes. There are also sepia flashbacks to the killer's past screen glories, and a slashed-up head banger who fights to death with Haywood in knight's armor.Plenty of movie posters of Haywood's films and a confusing and indifferent climax. It's like FADE TO BLACK with a great ode to old Hollywood."
5,Overlooked movie,It's not that well known but this one is a pretty good 80's slasher basic plot kids brake In what they thought was a dead actors house lance Hayward one by one there picked off..give a try you'll like it
1,Perfect for fledgling mass murderers like Booger,"This movie is a blueprint for how to ""do a lot of blood and kills"" as the murder expert Booger so eloquently opines in his review. My guess is that a large part of the sales of a movie like this are to uneducated loners like Booger who live in their mommy's basement and fantasize about gory murders day and night."
5,Live Billy! Be still my heart!,"I was blessed with the gift of seeing the engagements at The Jazz Standard in New York which led to this album, and I only wish the album was longer! 'Green Dolphin Street' has always been a favorite of mine, and Billy's instrumental version here is a treat for the ages. My best friend adores his version of 'There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York'. For total heartbreak, there's 'How Can I Lose You?' On a whole, this album is prime modern cabaret jazz. Now that you've heard the recording, check out his official website for when you can see him LIVE yourself! You won't be disappointed!"
5,"""BEAUTY ARISES FROM PRESENCE OF MIND AND SIMPLICITY.""","""THOUGH OUR MINDS MAY BE COMPLICATED, BEAUTY IS NOT. WE DON'T HAVE TO STRIVE TO MAKE BEAUTY IN OUR LIVES, OR LOOK FAR TO FIND IT. WHEN THE MIND IS STILL, WE CAN SEE A MAGNIFICENCE IN EVEN THE MOST ORDINARY THINGS--THE VIVIDNESS OF A SUNSET, THE WARMTH OF A SMILE, THE SIMPLICITY OF SERVING A CUP OF TEA. WE CAN SEE NEW LIFE AND GROWTH. EACH THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHERS, EACH MOMENT IS UNIQUE."" [from page 152.]Here are the chapters: 1) Discovering the Heart of Meditation 2) Meditation Instructions 3) Difficulties and Hindrances 4) Suffering: The Gateway to Compasion 5) Integrating Practice. (Each chapter is amazing but chapter five to me is the best. I have probably 85% of it highlighted!)This is a life-changing book. It's small enough to carry on your body and profound enough to envelop in your heart. I will cherish this always. My wish for all who read this is on page 170, paragraph one.Thank you Joseph and Jack!"
5,"Very, very good reading","Romances aren't really my favorite type of book but this is exceptionally good because it's very believable and very real. This story isn't dripping with unrealistic doting devotion. This story is so ""real life"".The characters are so easy to identify with as well as the jobs they have and the businesses they own. Life and love aren't always fair or easy to deal with, and this book touches on all of those things as well as the wonderful way the author describes the landscape and surroundings. I enjoyed this book a lot. Buy or borrow this book, you'll devour it and feel like you actually know these characters."
2,Boring,"I tried and tried to finish this book, but couldn't. The story and characters were so boring, I gave up."
2,Definitely not a keeper!,"When Rice's ""Angels All Over Town"" first came out, I rejoiced. Here was a smart, funny, quirky writer who could skillfully blend elements of romantic comedy, melodrama and, yes, even a ghost story.Where did that Luanne Rice go? ""Crazy in Love"" retained that sense of quirkiness, but it's been downhill ever since. Her books are growing less sophisticated and more obviously designed for the mass-market romance crowd. She's capable of more. I've bought every one of her books in hardover, praying for that sense of oddball magic, but with this mess, my loyalty has finally reached an end.Oh... the two stars are for the portrayal of the teen girl, who manages to struggle out from beneath the syrup to engage the reader's attention just long enough to finish the book. As for the rest of it... bleah."
5,Coud nine,"I found this book one I couldn't put down. Loved it all though I admit I cried a great deal during the last half of it. wonderful, moving and a caring book"
3,Cloud Nine,"Sarah Talbot is a cancer patient in remission... She still has lots of life in her even though she just finished her treatments. She meets Will Burke just after her hair begins to grow back and the two begin to fall in love. He is worried that he will loose her, but is willing to take a chance. Sarah is full of life and is an inspiration to all. She becomes a good friend and role model to Will's daughter Susan. Susan is young, confused and is trying to find herself. Sarah's carefree acceptance of life's tough circumstances serves as an inspiration to Susan. She teaches her the meaning of love."
1,sean paul a sell out...mr.sellout....fi get buyout....,"How you fi guh call other reggae artists ""Dudes""..yuh not only dis di artist dem but a whole nation a people..jus because..yuh have a likkle hype..bwoy mi a tell yuh sean paul is a big let down...."
4,not bad,"The album is a very good, yes. There are very good tracks. ""We Be Burnin"" and ""Temperature"", the latest singles are also good as well. I didn't like these two singles at first but now i do. They grew on me. My favorite songs on this album is ""Head to toe"" as well as ""Send It On"", ""i'll take you there"" and ""ever blazin"". ""Connection"" with Nina Sky is okay, but not a favorite. No. 9 which is a reggae track, is about family and friends that past away and Sean Paul acknowledges them. There are also some club bangers like ""Breakout"". The album still does not compare to ""Dutty Rock""."
5,HOT A@# CD 4 REAL,"I know I'm real late but when I went to get this CD the day it came out it was sold out everywhere. Then I went somewhere far and finally got it. I banged this cd since day one when it came out it has not left my cd player yet. Sean Paul worked it out on WE BE BURNIN, TEMPRATURE, BREAKOUT, HEAD IN THE ZONE and well da%n all the songs. Worth the buy is all i got to say Im out."
1,Mostly save your money.,"Even though I received this DVD for free I still consider it too expensive because the people responsible for this ""Mostly Autumn"" promo (sorry I mean ""critical review of Pink Floyd"") have stolen 90 minutes of my time that I will never get back. The appalling pub act, Mostly Autumn, are apparently ""the new Pink Floyd"" but as the longest bit of concert footage is actually of them murdering Comfortably Numb I can only assume this quote was made by a deaf, blind man.This is an unauthorised, cheaply made, rip off designed to make a quick buck using the name of a great band."
1,Unworthy,"I have rarely seen and heard such drivel as these two Pink Floyd DVDs, 1967-1974 and 1975 to 1989. My expectations for this material was to have new insights and understanding into the creativity of Pink Floyd. Instead, I was treated to meaningless interviews by nobodies and Pink Floyd wannabees with much of the soundtrack performed by a symphonic orchestra. Terribly disappointing!"
5,A great value,"These cheap knives are really great.I'm sure a purist would disagree, but they are plenty sharp in practice. They hold their edge a lot longer than a traditional quality steak knife.Of course, they can't be sharpened, the handles are crappy plastic, and they seem flimsy. But at the price, they are a great value."
3,Good humor,"Some fun humor, but the ending was obvious by page 12. Of course, the road there was not predictable, just the inevitability. So I'll give 3 stars for the inventive path."
2,Weak electrical and fuel injection,This manual is weak in certain areas. It is worth the price but the Bentley manual is much better being closer to real shop manual.
3,E. 1999 it Aint,"If this was any other group I'd probably give this LP 4Stars but compared to Bone's previous works it was an initial disapointment. I've grown to like it over the years though, for it's production and lyrics and because it blows away anything any rappers put out in the last 5 or so years. Also it has to many weak songs. It's still way better than BTNH Resurection though as far as just about everthing. If your a fan of good rap music you should check it out."
3,Shouldn't have been a double CD,The title of this review says it all. The best tracks are spread between both CDs. My fav tracks are:Body rottReady 4 WarAll OriginalWasteland Worriorsthe track featuring 2pacLet the law endThese tracks keep true to the Bone style.(Donno why am writing this review now. What I jus said has been said countless times in other reviews of this product and Ive had the album 4 5 years now)
2,They went Weak,"If you are a bone-fan and you havent got this yet, you are in for a disappointment. Creepin on ah Come Up and East 1999 Eternal were Bone's better albums, but now they have just alot of tracks, but not too many good tracks. They do have better beats and stuff like that, but they have lost my interest now. If you look at Creepin on ah Come Up,you will notice alot of hard core beats and lyrics. if your into hard core you wont like this album buy Creepin on ah come up or East 1999 Eternal first"
2,Dis Succd...,"I didnt like the album at all. I was expectin sumpin like E.1999 Eternal but got sumpin wacc. They got wacc lyrics and wacc beats on this one. The only tight song on there iz ""Thug Luv"" featuring 2Pac ( u cant go wrong wit 2Pac)."
2,Modern Parents Beware!,"There is a point in this movie where the poor picked on main character (stiles)realizes that physical violences gives power. And in this world of words are mightier than the sword, She changes all that. It is OK to verbaly insult someone to tears, but do not punch them or else your in trouble. So this wicked girl goes around doing physical violence because it shocks everyone. I remember a time when a parent would knock a kid into next week for saying half of what this girl says, But times change... The movie is predictable, there is no character to ground yourself with. It looks like Stiles made this movie years ago. Only worth watching if your a big fan and/or your up real late with absolutly nothing else to do."
2,Surreal and twisted dark comedy,"This movie features Julia Stiles playing a posessive teenager who turns into a domineering young woman with the Electra-complex after her mother's death. She is posessive of her father which whom she becomes obsessed with later on in the movie. As far as the plot, it takes on many facets which do not fit right for the theme of the movie. Through the protagonist's eyes, you can see how far away reality becomes, and eventually how she is corrupted through the events following her mother's death. At times, the incestual overtones made me queasy, and the end was sort of expected due to the lack of definition to the characters. Sometimes during the movie, one could get the feeling that it was more of a who-dun-it film than anything else. Although disturbing and dark to watch, there are not any scenes of nudity, just the adult situation, language, and violence content. Hope this helps."
4,The name 'Julia Stiles' drew me in first...,"Alone, at night, remote in hand......flipping to see what I could catch on cable that started within the next '15 minutes'. Only thing on was a movie called 'Wicked'. What caught me eye was the name 'Julia Stiles'. Big movie name with a movie title I had never heard. I wondered if it was a movie from when she was younger. First scene...Julia as a pre-teen. So, I knew it couldn't have been an old movie. You can read all the other reviews on what the movie is about. Was it good.....yep. Was it bad.....yep. Did I change the channel....nope. The movie held me for reasons unknown. Movies are meant to tell a story and give you entertainment. Whether that entertainment is in the form of muder, incest and adultury....doesn't matter. It's a story. I liked the movie. Why?...not sure. I just liked it. What I really liked is the soundtrack...which I can't find. Awesome sexy, disturbed music. Anyhow...would I buy the movie?......YES."
5,Psychiatrist was first rate.,"Fred Fason, MD the psychiatrist who testified on the case is a first rate forensic psychiatrist. In real life he is just as he is portrayed in the book."
1,Pure Blasphemy,"""God Himself is obliged to abide by the judgment of His priests, and either not to pardon or to pardon, according as they (the priests) refuse or give absolution...The sentence of the priest precedes, and God subscribes to it. - Dignities and Duties of the Priest vol.12 pg. 27God is obliged to abide by the judgment of the priest..really. The sentence of the priest precedes, and God subscribes to it...really."
3,Instrumental captivates but leaves out songs with vocals,"I really enjoyed the movie ""The Italian Job"" and one of the things that made it so good was the music. I had high hopes when I purchased the original motion picture soundtrack, but was disappointed with the lack of all vocalized songs especially the version of ""Money"" that was used in the end credits. The included background instrumental music tracks are captivating and entertaining, but they only supply just a part of the soundtrack. Unfortunately, there were no sample tracks to listen to before I made my purchase. I must admit that I do like and enjoy this CD despite the omissions. It's just that it could have easily been better."
4,"""Money"" is the name of the song.","The name of the song is ""Money"" and its a a re-make of the original song by Pink Floyd / Roger Waters / Album: Dark Side of the Moon (1973)."
5,Great Score,"John Powell did it again. . . and amazingly executed! I enjoyed the music when I heard it in theater and I still enjoy it on CD. Again, good job John. . . this is ONE soundtrack to never forget! Everbody who liked the movie should go out and buy this CD (or I guess you could download mp3 rips if that's what you do)!"
3,i thought i heard some Amon Tobin in there?,I thought i heard some Amon Tobin in there? can someone verify??
3,A Big Mistake,"There are some great moments on this sound track, and some very interesting orchestrations, but the One Glaring Omission is Roger Waters, MONEY.MONEY is in the film, and over the closing credits, but not on the disc - THIS is the reason I would have bought the cd."
4,Christmas Carol collection,"A very good transaction. Just a little disappointed in the rendering of the story. Another ""Christmas Carol"" to my collection so I'm satisfied."
5,New to Jini? Buy this book,"It is a VERY good book on Jini. This is my FIRST jini book. I am a jini newbie. This book has answered lot of my questions on Jini and has guided me, step by step, to develop my first Jini project. I realize this book isn't complete ... but as a software developer, I need a book which can guide me to write effective & good code AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I like it a lot ... really.Buy it"
2,Dull,"I thought I was watching a documentary, not a filmI guess I should appreciate the movie for its artistiuc merit but there are certain things about it that bothered me.For instance the lack of dialogue, lighting and camera shots made it very difficult for me to keep my eyes open.At one point in the film, for some reason the widow is depicted cleaning stair steps for a good 1-2 minutes. Scenes like that spoiled the movie for me by making it very dull.Its not that I'm some spoiled American who only likes watching action movies.If you are looking to view a more interesting film try ""Eel"" or ""Kikujiro""I just don't feel that this movie is for everyone. It certainly was not for me."
5,Maborosi,"A potent examination of one woman's attempt to cope with loss and grief, Koreeda's tranquil, almost unnervingly serene drama brings to mind the finest work of Ozu, especially with its humanism, compassion, and focus on the psychology of a female protagonist. Still and silent, yet visually ravishing, ""Maborosi"" is a kind of mourning song for vanished loved ones and the persistent enigma of others' inner emotional lives. Seeing it is a sort of healing experience."
3,ok buy,Has a amusing section on the making of manga with the Assistants slaving away . It's got some H moments with a guy drawing a girl he knows nude. So its probalby not for a 13 year old unless your a guy. I really used The ComplyingCharacters more than this sense i dont use Toner.
4,Awesome Organizer - Royal Davinci DV1,"Kudos to Royal on their new line of PDA's (DV1,DV2,and DV3). Small, portable, easy to use. While there is no graffiti language input, I found the on-screen keyboard quick and easy to use. This unit is excellent as an organizer, but lacks the ability to download software....All units come with a docking station, external keyboard, and leather case (case is sent free from Royal when the registration card is submitted), and software for organizing and syncing.I think Royal has done an excellent job of providing a quality unit. .... I found this an outstanding value....I also was able to sync with my computer with no problem....Bottom line... most people never use the ""extra"" features of the more expensive models, so why waste your money? My advice...go buy one, try it out....I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
2,Not what I thought it was,"After reading the description before buying, I thought that this might be just what I wanted. Not so. Instructions are not too clear, and the display sucks. You have to hold it a certain position to be able to see the display to do anything. It is supposed to have a backlit display, and it does, but what a joke. You can hardly tell the difference between backlit and not backlit. I have had other Royal electronics before and was very satisified. Not so with this . I really expected a whole lot more from Royal."
4,contents great - package not,"We love Avatar the Last Airbender. The package was damaged when it arrived, but the DVDs were fine."
5,This is the greatest cartoon of all time,"This is the greatest cartoon of all time, and is totally entertaining and instructional for both little ones and grown-ups. Want to teach your kids about the spirit world, about reincarnation? Don't want them to be afraid of stupid Christian dogma like demons? This is the show for you. Such a heroic question; novo-Buddhist. Amazing writing; every script. I've been watching it for years, as my kids are now 4 and 6, and I never, ever get tired of it. A must for your bookshelf."
5,Avatar The best cartoon the whole family can enjoy,This is a great cartoon probably the best since Princess Mononoke highly recommended except sucks to have to wait a year or so for the next book. Storyline is great the concept and stories will just drag you in very emotional and all around great animation...Believe me if you like animation this is a must have.
1,Force-Fed Endless Commercials,"Let me be clear: the series, Avatar, is worth of 5 stars. It's one of the best things to arrive on TV in a long time. It's a great, epic tale written with humor and filled with interesting, three-dimensional characters.The DVD gets 1 star. I put in the first disk, and was forced to watch AT LEAST ten minutes of commercials. I wasnt allowed to jump to the menu and start watching the show - the DVD prohibited that. So I PAID for this series and I'm forced to watch 10 minutes of commercials every time I turn on the DVD player? That's ridiculous. I say ""at least"" 10 minutes because that's when I turned it off and packaged it up for a refund.And the studios wonder why people prefer to download this stuff online."
2,"Show is great, but DVD video quality hit and miss","Episodes on the first disc have a pretty noticeable artifact that make them look blurry and poorly done. The issue seems to be confined mostly to the first disc, but there are still minor visual disturbances on the others. I'm hoping Nickelodeon will fix this issue and release an updated version."
3,"Great series, terrible DVD quality","My kids (ages 4 & 2) love this animated series. It is also very enjoyable for adults, at the same level as other high-end ""save the world"" productions like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. However, I have had problems with the 6 DVD set for the Book 1 Collection. I had problems with DVDs not working in each of the two sets that I ordered; when I tried to get a third set from Amazon, they told me that this has been a widespread problem and they would not ship out another set until this problem was fixed. If and when it is fixed, I will order this again.IF YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THIS SERIES IS ORGANIZED: the first season is ""Book 1: Water"", the second season is ""Book 2: Earth"" (and I assume there are two more seasons to come for Fire and Air). It took me awhile to figure this out since they also have volume listed, which represents the order of the shows for that season."
5,Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book One Collection,i enjoyed the movie so I bought this to watch the cartoon version to see all the little things about the story.
5,"Whats a better word for ""TOTALLY AMAZINGLY AWSOME""?",Avatar Book one is excellent. It was so great to be able to buy all the dvd's to the first series of Avatar: the last airbender. It means there were no cliffies... til I got to the end! lol
3,"Do not recommended, just if you're a huge fan","Like another people say, this is not a true Collector's edition.It came with the complete book 1, without differences with the normal version.The things added are: a DVD with interviews to the creators, and a mini book about the making of the cartoons.If you haven't the normal version, don't buy this one. Instead, if you going to get it for the first time, it's a good buy only if you're a fan."
3,"Good, in parts","Although i think Elisa is an awesome, talented singer/songwriter i have to say i was slightly disappointed with this album. I found the songs were of a reasonable standard, but the poduction let it down for me. I found that because Elisa's voice is generally too loud in all the songs, and the effort that has gone into the music is slightly lost. On her other albums, i find the vocal sits in the mix a lot better and sounds more like part of the songs. I'm probably listening to the album with rather a technical point of view, but then, that's me! That said, i'm listening to the album 'Lotus' and it's absolutely awesome! I think that Elisa is one of the most talented female singer/songwriters i've had the pleasure of listening to. Elisa fans will pretty much enjoy this album, but from a sound production point of view i feel some potentially golden moments haven't acheived their fullest potential. Anyway, i'll leave on the note that i totally LOVE her other stuff."
4,Incredible Album!,"Wire is an absolutely awesome cd. Perfect for those days when you're craving a heavier rock... ""Wire"" ""Innocent"" and ""San Angelo"" definitely rate among the best on the album, while ""Rock Star"" is also quite enjoyable. A definite must-have for any rock lover, it returns to the hard rock style of Conspiracy No. 5. Thank you, Third Day! You're music inspires me and I loved singing with you Mac!!!"
2,Not that great,"I bought this cd with a lot of enthusiasm. After reading the numerous reviews here, I didn't think I could go wrong. Incorrect. This is a pretty boring cd. All the songs sound the same. The vocalist does sound similar to Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine. The music, at times, conjures up Rage. Maybe a little Buckcherry, as well. The guitarist, however, isn't even close to being in the same league as Tom Morello.The problem is the songs are kinda flat. There's nothing extraordinary here. Track two, ""Movement"", could be a RATM reject from the first record. It's S.T.U.N.'s attempt at writing a song similar to ""Killing In the Name Of"". The next two songs are more of the same. *yawn* From there, the cd just delves into deep relms of mediocrity.I guess if you're looking for something like Zach de la Rocha fronting Buckcherry, this is for you. If this sounds scary, stay away."
3,DUBLIN (CITY GUIDE),"Covers the basics well, does not cover more indepth information, such as whom to contact for a private tour. Had to purchase yet another 'guide' book for more informtion."
5,"Exactly as I expected, though not as depicted","As others have pointed out, I received the silver version and not the black as shown in the pictures. This is really not an issue, but want others to be aware."
4,Good impact wrench but no easy chuck to use as impact driver!,"I bought this impact wrench to work on my old Camry 95 DX. Its a great tool for removing old nuts and bolts. I bled the brakes and replaced brake pads all with smart usage of this wrench. This wrench as the maximum torque rating for its price. I got it for $129.00+free shipping. In the hindsight had I done my research I would've got an impact driver with a chuck to use as impact wrench. I tried finding a chuck to use this impact wrench as impact driver but there's only ONE chuck, Cowan chuck available with any impact driver!!But for my usage this is a great product and I highly recommend it even for regular usage. Feels sturdy and solid. If you shell a little more get the Dewalt. A good competitor for this one is the Craftsman impact driver."
4,79.95? Wow!,"Great record, but $80 plus shipping? that seems insane. ""VI"" is a great addition to the CJ catalog, but it more like a $6 - $10 CD, not an $80 cd. Wow!"
5,Best financial engineering book on MC,This is like the bible of Monte Carlo methods in financing. Both a good read and a good reference book. Must have! for any quant on wall street.
2,I agree with Connectikat!,"I had a feeling this camera was going to take horrible pictures from the moment I opened the package. It's a light plastic thing with no flash. I definitely recommend it for children who are just starting to take pictures - who don't care about the quality. I spent about an hour trying to make my pictures look good with the software they provide. It still didn't help. If you're looking to get a digital camera for pictures that you wish to look at often and show to other people, don't waste your money on this one."
5,One to keep,"I've wanted this book for years, since I first read it. If you're a cat lover, you'll want to read and re-read. And give as a gift to others who share your affections for felines."
5,Excellent for beginners,"If you have bought a nice SLR camera (Minolta, Nikon, Canon, etc.) in the high hopes of showing your creative side on film, this is the book for you.As with any other art, your creative side is best expressed in photography if you know the basics of how to take photographs. Many people wrongly assume that they can take excellent pictures the moment they get their hands on an SLR.This book gives a great 101 on the various terms and terminologies used in amateur photography. The best I like about the book are the amazing illustrations and crisp explanations.The book is not too thick or too thin - it is just right.If you are serious about learning photography, get this book."
5,Can't go wrong for the price!,"My boys (4 and 6) love using these stencils for creating scenes on paper. There are six different stencils, including an engine, caboose, and coal car. The shapes are anywhere from 2-1/2 to 5"" long and roughly 2"" tall. Can't beat the price!"
5,When will there be a region one version?????,"I was a huge fan of this series back in the day and would be the first in line for a region one version of the DVD set.C'mon, even a limited run would be appreciated."
1,A Shameful Fraud,I read this book with the deliberate understanding that this was an autobiographical memoir based in TRUTH and FACT. I (along with everyone else) was duped. Shame on everyone involved in this FRAUD. We were sold a fake bill of goods and I want my money back. Perhaps if the millions of readers who purchased this book filed a class action suit to recover our money - then the publishing industry would think twice before playing we readers for fools.
5,See how society throws away kids.....read for yourself!,"The experiences of J.T. Leroy are like many of those had by children I have counseled over the past 12 years. Though many readers may gasp or grunt with dismay over the raw, gritty descriptions Leroy has to offer, my advice to you is this: suck it up and get over it, because this is nothing compared to what some kids have experienced. So, put away your shocked faces, your queasy stomaches, and come out from your neatly sheltered lives for just long enough to understand and come to terms with how we throw away kids in society, just like Leroy. Be willing, for just a few hours, to delve into the darker side of life, a side that exists for children all over the world, and maybe this one opportunity will encourage you to go about your daily business with a little more sensitivity and compassion for others."
1,a disappointment with potential,"the amount of hype this book received is perplexing. he is young, yes; the story itself (stripped of leroy's difficulties with its execution)is unique and entertaining, yes; but the writing is amateurish, sluggish, and lacking the qualities i expected in a novel that had garnered so much praise. ....this book is all story and no craft, like a tv movie. that said, the story is very sweet and the characters are interesting. they're one-dimensional, but the one dimension each is allotted contains funny bits and good dialogue. .... it's different because of its location and its subject matter...."
1,"Yeah, right","Thanks for popping in, Team LeRoy, and giving a praise-heavy review. How surprising.Otherwise, if someone thinks this book is remarkable and that the scam was a good thing than they either (1) Wrote this book, or (2) Haven't read very many books. In this case it's probably both."
4,Perhaps their best ever,"This is an extraordinarily solid release finding Brooks and Dunn at the top of their game. The first song, ""You Can't Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl,"" might be a little weaker than the rest. The arrangements are very good, slick but not overproduced. There's a lot of good blues guitar on this album. The lyrics are rife with middle America sentimentality, which either you love or you don't.The strength of this album is its variety - from the infectious 70's electric guitar licks in ""Caroline"" to the creepy but captivating gospel sound on the uncredited last track (""Holy War is Coming""). The album showcases two very talented artists and their remarkable backing musicians."
3,Not the best...,"After listening to this CD I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm much better off with ""old school"" Brooks & Dunn.This CD is fun, energetic, and really, really corney. I bought it for the popular song, ""You Can't Take the Honkey Tonk Outa the Girl"", and also because I just wanted to expand my country music collection. That song is pretty representitive of the rest of the songs. But where with that song I can sing it the whole way through and back again, I got bored with the others. There is something missing.As with most every country CD there is talk about drinking, Jesus, and women. But from songs like ""Red Dirt Road"" these references more or less just stuck me as corney.The CD, apart from these songs, is typical modern country. Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing really worth buying when you can hear better on the radio.I do think that anyone who loves Toby Keith's ""Unleashed"" would love this CD. They have a similar sound (though I'm partial to the former.)"
4,Instant heat,The device is just the right size to place on my aircraft oil sump and provides plenty of heat. Great heater.
1,"Has Poweroff issue, not responsive customer service","The monitor works fine for a few months. Then the image will disappear when the computer is back from the XP powersave mode. We have to turn off the monitor and turn it on again to restore the image. It gets worse recently, now we have to do this 3-4 times. Called their customer service, waited for 30 mins still no responses. Terrible."
2,Yawn...,"Here is one thing Dave would not want to hear. This season is just not as good as the last two seasons. There are good chuckles, but that is about it. Dave was right to leave when he did. The pixie skit is more than enough reason to justify his leaving. I will be supporting Dave and not buying this DVD since he didn't want it out in the first place!"
4,USED,Considering it was a used DVD. It was in great condition no problems. I was very satisfied with the time it took to arrive. I would definitely consider making future purchases at amazon.
2,That's It?,"Well, Dave Chappelle sure started this whole big conteversy about how the episodes were becoming more racial stereotyping. He spent all these days worrying about how he was going to look after these sketches aired. I would look embarrased if I had written these sketches because most of them were just awful. Donell Rawlings and Charlie Murphy are good, but they cannot set up a skit to save their life. I would've spent less time worrying about how racial the sketches are and just take the time that is left and write better ones, but instead he had a tissy fit and left the show. I guess Paramount and Comedy Central can just keep making money off of him now."
2,bought it to support Chappelle,"But it's short and feels like it was rushed to throw out to make money for comedy central, if you don't already own it, buy his stand-ups, ALOT more classic material. Might not be saying ""BEE-YAHH!!"" Like every other rich white kid, but you'll be saying ""look at him....he LOVES IT, it's just like they said in the books!"" and many other great lines"
5,A fun filled adventure film with a fantastic cast.,"Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Ernest Bourgnine what powerful characters. Ragnar amd Inar (sic) what a father son relationship. ""Odin, bring the wind and turn the tide"". I can only hope that Hollywood comes to its senses and releases this on DVD. I would buy it in a New York minute."
4,Great for a persuasive writing prompt!,"As a third grade teacher in Illinois, my colleagues and I found this book not only an entertaining story, but a writing prompt for a persuasive essay that our students eagerly approached. To squish or not to squish! The kids just ate it up. We had quite the debate in our classroom!"
4,I loved it but...,"I loved this book and the intention the author had to encourage children to consider the moral of the story. Also for a children's book it is well written with amusing rhymes. The kids also loved hearing this story. The only problem was this - they got absolutely the wrong message from it!The book presents two arguments - the ant pleading for its life, and the boy who questions the value of the ant's life. But the author wrote the boy's side of the story so pleasingly that my kids far more enjoyed siding with the boy than with the ant, despite explanation, to my complete despair! My young listeners were quite young, ages 2-3, so perhaps this book would be better for a slightly older child."
1,Porque codificar un DVD?,"Yo habia esperado con ansias un DVD de Charly y ahora resulta que no lo voy a poder ver porque esta codificado en la region 1. Sinceramente no hay razon para codificar los DVD's y menos un DVD de musica.Avisenme cuando salga la version sin codificar para poder darle una mejor calificacion, porque sin duda es este DVD una obra de arte sin precedentes. Debido a la codificacion es para mi como una estatua magnifica envuelta en un saco."
5,Spectacular,"Many people make mistakes in their lives, but when you admit it and make a change, now that's when everyone in today's world could learn a few things. After I completed this read, I was so moved by the story, I decided to make a change in my personal life for the better and it has been working in my favor. Thank you!"
3,They definitely need a producer to reign them in...,"While _Frances The Mute_ has put The Mars Volta on the map, it is this, their full-length debut, that is their finest work so far. The mindless meandering present on _Frances_ is gone here; producer Rick Rubin successfully tamed the band, and the result is a much more focused album. It isn't the prog rock masterpiece of the 21st century (right now that title belongs to Porcupine Tree's _In Absentia_), but it's a strong debut that shows that the band might not be a joke after all."
5,"Boo hoo, this sounds like Rush....","You people that have given this CD terrible reviews are absolutely nuts. This a wonderful break from the horrible music that is currently corrupting the airwaves. Sure, some of you may find it hard to swallow complexity, but open your mind and free your brain from the 3 or 4 chords that corrupted it previously.This record is daring, and complex. It has wonderful musicianship, and the layers of sound are absolute beauty in my ears.Too often, we want the hook, the pay off, the ""pop gem"". Well, this aint it. If you want that, turn on your radio and turn off your brain. When it's ready to take in a little more, try this again, you might just like it."
4,Brilliant,"This album is not for those who like cute three minute pop songs, in fact it stretches music itself with guitar solos, bleeps, electronic drones, and whatever else the Mars Volta can throw in. It should be listened to as a whole as it shows it's brilliance with repeated listens. Mars Volta combine Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Aphex Twin, and Yes all into one but maintain their unique sound. What more can be said about this that hasn't been said by the other reviewers, it is amazing music plain and complex. The vocals at times seem like an instrument themselves and the guitar work is as intricate as you can get. Mars Volta are the good band that resulted from punk outfit At-The- Drive-In. Do yourself a favor and buy this ASAP."
1,If you hate Rush stay away,"I bought this album after hearing all the positive reviews about them and how they sound like some classic bands (i.e Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin). Now if you like to listen to classic rock with the bass all the way down and the trebble set to the max then we might be comparing these bands. All i could hear was Rush, and i hate Rush. I usually give bands a few tries before judging but i like my ears, so i opted to throw the cd out my window and beat my ears against my steering wheel, an obviously more enjoyable experience. Everybody's entitled to their own likes in music; people liked Rush, i personally don't get it. IF YOU HATE THE GROUP RUSH LIKE I DO, STAY AWAY! I am definatley not a pop music fan which is why i bought this album in the first place, i like to hear goups that are unique in these days of ""hey, look at me, we sound like Lincoln Park too."" This album just has a sound i hate."
1,Pretention put to tape.,"This album is honestly, an atrocity. It is a combination of too much musicianship and pretentiousness, without any true musical character. Fans will claim that lyrics like ""Exoskeletal judging by the railroad delay"" are brilliant; well they aren't. It almost seems like the band chose words randomly out of a dictionary.Avoid this smorgus board of meaningless drivel, repetitive riffs, and pretention. Do yourself a favor by checking out Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, or Wilco; 3 modern bands that are more important than this group of Berkley rejects will ever be."
4,Please stop with the Rush comparisons,"First before i get into how much i like the album I am tired of all the people ripping the album because the lead singer of Mars Volta sounds like Geddy Lee of Rush. Yes he does sound like Geddy Lee, get over it. Rush are immensely talented musicians, simple as that. The music of Mars Volta is very complex and cannot be fully appreciated with one listen. By far the best song of the album is ""Drunkship of Lanterns"". In six minutes, there is elements of The Beatles, Santana and Rush. You are not going to find that anywhere else. This song alone makes the album worth the purchase. The only complaint i have is that occasionally the songs become slightly disjointed like they could have ended 2 minutes before they actually did or could have been completely different songs all together. But other than that an excellent album"
5,Rush's 2112 meets modern progression,"the mars vota is what you would get if you threw Rush's classic meticulously crafted progressive rock in with Radiohead's elctronic experimentation and added a dash of Tool's Lateralus epic structure and hit blend. the record is a musical journey through the unknown. every song starts of subtly and gradually bouilds to a powerful eplosion of rock. its so good. its new, not recycled retro-rock. it makes an attempt to invent and add to the rock scene, and it succeeds in doing so."
1,Why wasn't i warned that this reeks of Rush,... All i heard was Rush. Whiney-whiney Rush. I always give something new a few go throughs before judging them but i beer coastered this one after one listening. ...
2,Don't be fooled,"Well it's different, but doesn't mean it's good. They seem like talented musicians except they can't write a song to save thier lives. They're too busy trying to be as arty as possible whether it be the tuneless bombastic music or the ridiculously inane lyrics. He obviously used a thesaurus for every single word he wrote for this album. I gave it 2 stars because john frusciante, who is a true music visionary appears on it."
4,I bet they were told it would never work....,"...yet they did it anyways. In a land filled with pop music that is worthless and canned, this is a great album to defy the critics. The band consists of at least a couple dozen people playing french horns, kettle drums, steel guitar, and an entire choir. At times it can sound slightly overwhelming, but the brightness and fun of the album really takes you over and gives us what we are looking for. With the amount of melancholy and sadness that seems to go with music these days, it is amazing to see a band (not made of 5 hot dudes, or 1 sleazy chick) sing about being happy, and sing about the sun!!?!? This album is not for everbody, but surely if you are a music fan, then you are for this album."
3,Up With People on LSD,"While their live stuff is better than their studio efforts, The Polyphonic Spree is a guilty pleasure of mine. But, they are far from original. Perhaps imitation is the greatest from of flattery, but I would suggest listening to the real thing. Try early Brian Eno - The Warm Jets Are Coming and the first Dream Academy album. If you buy the Spree's bonus CD's you get a DVD and it is a plus to watch a band that actually enjoys performing."
3,Wait for their next release,"Only a few songs worth listening to; and until they get better musically(lyrically, instrumentally, vocally), skip them and go straight to THE FLAMING LIPS."
1,"Oh, dear lord...","I saw this band open up for Bowie. They creeped me out so bad, I had to go hang out in the lobby. I don't get it. What are they? A bunch of kids that just got out of rehab? Sure, they certainly are positive, but in a creepy, Jim Jones meets HAIR, sort of way. It just seemed totally ridiculus and nauseating. PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THIS BAND TO THE FLAMING LIPS!!!! THEY ARE NOTHING LIKE THE FLAMING LIPS!!!!....YOU IDIOTS!!!!"
1,The Return of the Heaven's Gate,"Jesus, Mary and Saint Joseph if this is not the most disturbingly off putting outfit (I won't call them a band)in recent years. They must live in a commune, grow their own food, and have no contact with the outside world other than when they tour, or recruit, or play music, or brainwash...Each time I see the commercial on TV with all these freaks singing and dancing about in bed sheet like robes, I want to push the tv over like Travis Bickle. This could possibly be the worst album and band I have ever had the misfortune of listening to. I hope the all kill themselves when the next comet comes. That bad."
3,Beginning Stages of the Spree,"The tracks #1 through 9 take me on a variety of little journeys.I was curious about this band after seeing them perform ""It's the Sun"" on Austin City Limits. Such energy & enthusiasm! Track #10 (A Long Day),I feel,is a blatant waste of 36 minutes of precious space! I picked this CD because I felt it was going to give me 'extended' listening pleasure. Instead one is assaulted with mindless humming , bleeps & buzzes that conjure up sounds from a nuclear reactor.A chance for the Spree to deliver, & they cop out royally on this track! My Frigidaire refrigerator sounds better. Besides this, they are bravely innovative. It is refreshing to hear other instruments besides the standard R & R electrics."
3,Beautifully drawn--Story Lacking,"The title of my review mostly says it all. The images in this graphic novel are breathtaking at times. Gorgeous and impossible simultaneously. I'm glad I bought it for that reason alone.That said, the story is lacking. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere. Or, it does, but it ends right when you'd think it should be beginning. The concept is interesting and it had potential to pull something great out of such an artistically drawn hat. Unfortunately, it doesn't excel as well as one might hope.But if you like pretty pictures, then go for it. I promise you won't be disappointed."
1,COMPLETE JUNK,"Please do not disappoint a child with this toy if they are hoping for a working video camera. The video is horrible. Even in a well lit room video and photos are too dark to view. The video camera and still camera are difficult to operate for an adult, much less a child. Makes a great paper weight. Other than that...it serves no purpose."
2,Not worth it,This book is confusing and not a great guide as a Basic Science Review. For ABSITE prep material I'd rather use the Rush Review.
3,Looks Great,The clock looks great and adds interest to my french theme bedroom.The clock itself is not very sturdy.It is light wieght plastic and pops into the statue.It occasionally falls out.Still looks great though.
2,not as super as I would have hoped,"I am a big fan of Bumble & Bumble but I was a bit disappointed with this conditioner. First off, the conditioner doesn't smell very good. Yes, the texture is thick and rich and even after rinsing makes your hair feel smooth. But, in my opinion this is ideal for people that have very-very dry hair. If your hair is not super dry, this product may moisturize too much. My hair feels great after I blow-dry it but I notice by the end of the day, my hair is almost oily. If you do use this product, use a very small amount and work it in prior to rinsing."
5,My only in shower hair conditioner,"This is my second bottle of Super Rich Conditioner. It has managed to edge out all my other rinse-out conditioners, now its the only one I use. I have curly, dry, frizzy hair, and this conditioner actually helps without leaving my hair feeling waxy and heavy."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","This book sounded a lot cooler than it turned out to be, and while there were a few interesting conceits, it didn't work for me as a whole. About 20 years in the future there is no electricity, it has simply ceased to work, and for some reason reproduction is much rarer as well. Thus, in New York, nannies are heat-packing badasses, hooked on a drug called ""Vengeance."" Unfortunately, this doesn't lead the reader anywhere particularly interesting."
1,ugh,"portentious, pretentious drivel. the success Bowman might have had with his first book has clearly gone to his head in this dull, dull book."
1,Printer Compatibility and Cleanliness Problems,Epson's software is not compatible with my Hewlett Packard 970 CSE desket printer. The consequence is that the copy function and photo print function don't work. The maunual and advertising don't address this problem. It would also appear that the scanner has contamination inside (under the glass) - as no matter how much I clean the outer glass surface my images have dust features.
2,Epson Perfection 1240U Color Flatbed Scanner by Epson,"Excellent scanner, very happy with image quality. No problems, except the Xerox software supplied with the scanner is quite [bad]. Takes many a click through to many pages to do what, for example, Cannon software can do on one page, really simply.. Would get 5 stars otherwise."
2,Saving Scanned Pictures,"I purchased the 1240U to scan family pictures to the computer's hard drive. I am very disappointed that this scanner seems to do everything but scan photos directly to the hard drive. I don't want to send photos directly to email or to the printer. I want to save them on my computer. There is no easy way to do that. Even tech support said ""sorry"". Using the watered-down version of Adobe provided with the scanner I could save them to the hard drive but only in the adobe format, not as a jpeg, etc. I went out and purchased Microsoft's PictureIt 2001 and now scan the pictures through that program and save them in the appropriate file format. I would have returned the scanner except I purchased it over the internet."
4,An encouraging view of the future...,"A refreshing book with something rare in environmental writing; an encouraging look at the future! This book presents a clear point throughout: technology, civilization, and nature are not at odds with each other, but are best viewed as actually deeply connected and at this point, interdependent."
1,A terrible product,"This is an AWFUL product that can really mess up your PC. I followed the instructions exactly, told it what files I wanted to transfer, etc. On some it only transferred part of the files. It was then impossible to remove some of those parts from my new PC. I also couldn't download new versions of the programmes because it kept detecting that the files were already there, but unremovable. Finally I had to undo the move, which their ""support line"" assured me would not impact anything new I had added. This was not true at all, it messed up my PC completely and erased nearly every new file I created or added since. So far I have spent days trying to add and rebuild everything. My advise to anyone is to NEVER BUY OR USE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,great show but...,"I don't know where the first reviewer ever got the idea that the Stones, Dead, The Beatles, and Dylan were at this show. This simply did not happen. None the less, this is a great show, catching Marley and band in their prime."
5,The BEST live cd out there.,"I have been listenting to Bob Marley since junior high (I'm 44 yo now) and have bought/re-bought most all of his recordings - first on cassette, then on CD, then on re-mastered CD versions, etc.IMO, this is his best live recording. The sound quality is quite good and the ""ambiance"" of the set is very intimate so you feel like you are right there in the audience. The group sounds super tight and Bob's voice is in great form. This has become my ""go to"" CD when I need to feel irie. If you are even a casual Bob Marley and the Wailers fan, you should get this - you won't be disappointed."
2,A disservice to Tiger,"We all love Tiger (at least you can assume we do, if we're reading this book), and we're all hungry for information about him, especially since he has been ""handled"" so carefully by those that surround him.Thus, it is especially disappointing to encounter the typographical errors (I counted at least 30, then gave up), factual errors (Jack Nicklaus is said to be 70 years old), and fundamental writing flaws (""in lieu of"" for ""in light of"") littered throughout this book.I felt cheated to have paid money for this book, which was obviously rushed to press to capitalize on holiday purchases. That's no excuse for editorial sloppiness."
4,Great album...but not nearly their best,"Someone submitted this album as Megadeth's best by far...that's simply insane. Nothing the band (or almost any other metal band) has done comes even close to the unadulterated genius and power of Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Certainly Killing is My Business...And Business is Good is a solid metal effort with plenty of heavy tunes, but if you really want to experience Megadeth at their finest, pick up Peace Sells...it'll be the last peaceful thing you do"
5,Warning! Song Missing!,"Warning! There is a song missing from this CD that is on the original album! Imagine my dismay when my favorite song ""These Boots"" failed to be heard at its appointed time. That's right. This fantastic cover of the Sinatra classic is actually missing from this CD and I have no idea why! I kept the disc anyway because I love the album but, buyer beware. If you really love the band like I do and if you really dig that song, you will be disappointed like I was. I would really like to know why it was removed anyway?"
5,"Great Thrash Metal Never Gets Old, THIS IS A CLASSIC!","Fast and Furious, Killing is my Buisness is a mix of incredible tight guitar work and speedy bass that never lets up!"
5,A very respectable hard-rocking debut album,"Dave Mustaine and co. is lean and mean on this low-budget masterpiece. Mustaine proves without a doubt that being let go from Metallica is the greatest thing that ever happened to him. He shows he is a far better axe-grinder and vocalist than Hetfield or Hammett. Still great to listen to in the morning waking up(!) after all these years. That 'version' of The Four Horsemen (or is it the other way around?) absolutely rocks. The only complaint I have is the length (31 min) of this CD. Also the Poland/Samuelson lineup was the best they had besides Menza/Friedman. Every 'Deth fan should have this up to Youthanasia. By all means buy it, stick it on, and crank it up!"
3,Cute,"I wanted a good vampire read to get into the Halloween spirit and this was a good one. Cute but not too dark. I got the teensiest bit annoyed with the heroine by the end of the book, but that could just be because the love triangle didn't work out the way I wanted it to. Big burly blonde guys are SO much cuter than dark brooding ones. But anyway. Good, fun, and cute."
5,Just like I promised!,"I picked this book up at the RT Convention Book Fair in Daytona Beach this past Saturday. I finished it on Monday morning sitting in the airport. It was so captivating that I couldn't put it down. I started it in the bathtub and turned to a prune reading it for two hours, because I didn't want to put it down long enough to get out of the tub. I can't wait for ""Angel with Attitude"" to come out!"
2,Am I the only one?,"Am I the only person who has read this book that thought there was more romance between Sarah and Quinn than Sarah and Thierry? I wanted to like this book and I basically did, but I felt there were some major things wrong with it once I had finished. It was very humorous and I enjoyed the character of Sarah. I don't feel the author showed us enough of why Sarah liked Thierry and not Quinn. Sure, Thierry was dark and handsome, but there wasn't enough between he and Sarah in the book. I felt the romantic tension was lacking. It never came to fruition either. At the end, they were away together but we never saw how they got to that point.This was an okay book. It certainly wasn't a keeper like How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire. That was an excellent vamp book and I am eagerly awaitng the sequel."
4,Fast paced and funny.,"I wasn't expecting the book to be like it is. I was expectiong a lot more romance since it's supposed to be a paranormal romance book. I was a little disappointed about that aspect but recovered when I realized what a fun read this was. There aren't that many vampire books out there that aren't all gore and horror, so I loved that this wasn't that way.I'm looking forward to reading Michelle Rowen's next book."
3,One-Trick Paul Simon,"Paul Simon has always been a great singer-songwriter. I've never pictured him as a screenwriter until I heard about, and saw this movie.(I even have a book of the movie script.) It was about a fictional rock star named [Jonah Levin]. With all the major changes in the music industry, Jonah's career was disintegrating, as was his marriage. Eventually he reclaimed both things in the end. Although, the movie wasn't a huge success, it was still a great movie. Besides Paul, the cameo appearances of musicians Steve Gadd, Eric Gale, Tony Levin, and Richard Tee were superb. Even the cameo appearances of [Harper] Simon, the B-52's, Sam and Dave, the Lovin' Spoonful, Tiny Tim, and Lou Reed were also outstanding. Paul is still one of the most gifted stars I've ever known. I hope he still continues to be like that. As I once said in an old review, ""You can't teach an old pony new tricks."""
3,Handy but limited,"As a buyer of several years I found that this book addressed the fundamentals of purchasing quite well but is a bit old-fashioned. Obviously, since it came out in 1992, it does not contain any information about on-line buying and the computer section is rather quaint given today's business practices, software choices and skills. I would recommend it to a for an entry-level purchasing assistant or a junior buyer without formal training. I would be very interested in an updated version of this book."
3,great good quality but sizes are off I,The shirt is cool and good quality but the sizes are off I order a 5XL and it small is a good shirt
1,Don't Buy this book - even used.,"I felt ripped off even though i got this book at the local library. I was excited to read it because of the interesting title, but I was severely disappointed. I'm into nutritional anthropology, human culture as it relates to food, nutrition, cooking but this book is very short and contains almost nothing that teaches. Look up some web sites for free instead and save your money and learn something fun and interesting in the process. I've read hundreds of books on the topics I mentioned above, and this is perhaps the most disappointing one I've ever read. The price is also ridiculous for this piece of junk!!!"
1,dismayed Lettermen Fan!,"If you heard the original lettermen & their superb LP's of the 60's and 70's,you will rate this CD five stars.The new Lettermen recruited by the original Lettermen himself, Mr. Tony Butala is a big disappointment, their voices in this CD is quite unacceptable,doesn't blend very well(needs more practice), except for the last selection ""Wind Beneath My Wings""..sorry to say that the new Lettermen doesn't blend anymore to the new millenium.All their classic albums should be revived instead of compiling them from their different albums to contain the same songs in their different CD albums .I have collected 37 of their standard long playings the only problem though, playing them, skips most of their tracks..so this maybe an eye opener to the recording company,to re-record all of their albums in CD format.Why waste their melodic,harmonious voices in their existing short limited selections in one CD,there ought to be more.Don't waste your money with this CD."
1,WHY IS CYNTHIA ROTHROCK IN THIS?,"Being a huge fan of Cynthia Rothrock, I opted to rent a copy of this film when I saw her name in the credits. Cynthia is one of the all-time greatest martial-arts stars, ranking along with Chuck Norris & Jackie Chan. So, imagine my surprise when I viewed this movie and saw that, not only was her role just an extended cameo, but she had no fights scenes. The only scene worth watching was a bedroom scene in which she wears a somewhat revealing nightie. This was a major departure from her established martial-arts personna."
1,Not a good choice,I was very disappointed with this. Poor workmanship. One of the two rings I ordered wasn't even finished all the way around. Will either toss or return if possible. Don't bother!
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this video from the trailer at the start of ""Iron Monkey"", and was disappointed. There's very little action in this movie, and what action there is shot from bad angles. Plus, the English subtitles are poorly done. There's not enough comedy to be a parody, and not enough action to be serious.This is a rental at best."
4,A surprise,"I heard terrible things about this from Li fans, but it's really quite good: worlds' better than ""Black Mask,"" or ""Once Upon a Time in China and America."" It starts out slow, but the climactic fight scene is superlative. Check it out!"
2,Disappointing.,"Personally, I feel that Jet Li was stuck for ideas with this one. I thought that the ""light ring"" gimmick was ridiculous and was simply to make up for the bad guy's lack of martial arts ability. Jet Li needs to find new inspiration for his fight scenes before they all start to look the same. A shame."
1,terrible,Did not work at all. This product was terrible very disappointed. I used it as directed and it did not work at all.
4,Expandable Jug,"The jug was convenient and worked as described. However, the seam near the handle tore during a camping trip. I called Coghlan's directly when I retuned home.Customer Service was polite and accommodating. They mailed me a replacement, immediately, at no charge. I have purchased many items from Coghlan's and would not hesitate to buy more."
4,If it weren't for Smiling Faces,"This actually is rather good stuff. There's Gospel and Funk, and Disco, and some Psychedelia on this slab of cd. I do hate thier lone hit though, and that was the ""Smiling Faces"". I hate it for many reasons; for starters it's a turn off to me the way that they sing about people only pretending to be your friend. Well after all they are the Undisputed Truth, but it still hurts, and so does the harmonica. You see I hold out for the faith that there are people out there who love you for who you are, and not what you can do for them. I feel my favorite here is thier song ""Higher Than High"". It's got some real grooves there, and it's sounding rather psychedelic. The rest are good too, but I just wanted to finally vent on ""Smiling Faces"". For those who have been hurt by people, and want to turn your back on them just remember this ""A who wants many friends must be a friend himself..., but there's a friend who sticks closer than a brother."" Proverbs 18:24."
3,ball of confusion?,"Note to ""A Music Fan"": The probable reason these ""remastered"" versions don't sound the same as the originals is that the definitive versions of several of the songs, including ""Papa Was A Rolling Stone"" and ""Ball of Confusion"" were recorded by the Temptations, not this group! Check out ""Psychedelic Soul"" or one of the Tempts other compilations to see.At the time, the writers and execs of the Motown music machine were in the habit of having more than one group record their songs, as a way of pushing the songs as well as promoting the groups. Yes, a bit cynical and confusing...The Undisputed Truth, however, did record the definitve, darkly beautiful version of ""Smiling Faces"" heard here."
5,Basic watch at a good price,This watch is simple but rugged with the bonus of indiglo - something you cannot get with any other watch
1,AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this watch because it said Case Diameter 41mm. Its not that size at all. It's not what I expected from a seller at Amazon to do.When I bought the Dakota Black field watch I got the large size.The watches size is a kids watch.I am very very upset over this purchase. I just wanted a large face watch which is simple to use.
3,Good but God of War is Great,"This is a great game and should be purchased if you love Greco/Roman storylines. The price on Amazon is a rip off though. You can find the game on the gamequestdirect website for about $18.99.The storyline is very generic and fraught with poor voice acting and misspelled subtitles. For $18.99 it's a steal, for $49.99 it's a pass.Hope this helps.Swany"
3,"Good story line, but no horses. :(","I enjoyed reading the book. It's neat to know how Stevie, Carole, and Lisa are when their older. I wish it would be a bit more about horeses though. I especially love it when the kids from Pine Hollow would go to horse shows. I hope that in the future, the saddle club will continue to ride horses during college and make a living out of it. Keep up the good job writing and please continue with the saddle club and pine hollow books. ~Elsa"
3,okay,"I love meprolights and use them on most of my carry pistols. I wish they would have improved on the sight design for these instead of mimicking the stock Walthers. There is entirely too much play in the front dot between the rear dots when obtaining a sight picture. Other than that, standard mepro quality. The sights are really the only thorn in the side of the PPQ."
2,"You get the story in print, but that's about it.","Ellis' Steam Man of the Prairies is a landmark in American science fiction that's not readily available in print. I appreciate Dodo Press's work in putting this into an inexpensive paperback edition, but the finished product is a bit disappointing.The edition is filled with printing typos. While that may be in the spirit of the old time ""dime novels"" where the story first appeared, it should've been edited more carefully for today's readers. It also contains no real background information about the story. There's no intro or afterword, no print history, no pictures (which is a shame, because the tale inspired plenty of artistic interpretations, even in the cheap reprints of the late 19th century). This edition is as bare-bones as it gets."
5,CD,"Awesome CD, really good. I have a question though, who was the girl singing on Whiskey You're The Devil?"
4,Great body control.,"I am a tall plus size senior citizen. Have gained a lot of weight since my 50s and this garment holds in the body area to keep me looking firmer and sleeker in spite of the flab. I had to let out the adjustable straps all the way because of my 5' 10"" height. It fits well and no binding under my breasts like mot bras. It does, however bind a bit along the front of the underarms. I did some creative folding under and stitching to make it more comfortable. I have several other Glamorise briefer/girdles. I love this brand and appreciate that they make their garments large for us plus size gals."
5,review,"Just got this book, although I am very familiar with Haynes technical publications having owned other Haynes books on motorcycle maintenance, automotive, electrical, etc. and they are excellent. This book looks great. What's remarkable about it is that is profusely illustrated with color photos and diagrams which take you through every thing you need to know, all the maintenance and repair procedures are in it, including what tools you need. The only negative is that it looks like it was last revised in 2001, so it may not cover some of the latest equipment, which does not bother me in the least because I'm into vintage and old school steel framed bikes anyway. Highly recommended."
3,Fun book for animal folks and mystery lovers,"I'd call this book a ""light read""...fun and not too heavy. We ""animal folks"" will enjoy Max and Lou, the main character's dogs, who tag along on her travels. They have more personality than the stuck-in-the-70's boyfriend.If you enjoy animals and mystery this is a good one to read on breaks or the morning commute. One can tell it's a first effort from this author, and as I have already started the next book in the series, I can tell you Baxter improves her style on the second round."
4,"Good, but could have been better","Okay, so we have the dragons of earth and the dragons of heaven all in this apocaliptic battle that will determine the future of the earth, no problem. There is a young boy with an amazing power and he must fight his twin star which just so happens to be his best friend, okay. This is where the problem comes in we have such a lack of charecter depth. If you do not go to the special features and read the backgrounds then you will be at total lost. The story could have expanded on more of the charecter's background such as the main charecter's relationship with his mother, or the connection between the two best friends could have been explained more. I've heard that there is a series based of the movie so maybe that will help explain a lot of holes. Overall great fight scenes with a downer ending."
4,X,"A wonderful movie if you're a fan of anime. But be forewarned, if you don't know X (either the manga by CLAMP or the TV series) then you're going to be a bit lost. They only had a certain amount of time to fit in the characters and, unfortunately, that doesn't leave much room for you to grow to care for them (unless you already know them).However, the artwork is visually stunning and if you know the whole story from other sources it makes the movie much more enjoyable. I'd do a small bit of research on the manga and the characters before watching the movie.And a word of advice -- if at all possible, do not watch the dubbed. Whoever it was they chose to do Kamui's voice would be better suited to play in an episode of Speed Racer. None of the voices matched the characters, in my opinion."
2,Doesn't excite me...,"Simply put, you had to have seen the series (X) to understand what is going on in the movie; or rather you had to have seen the series to appreciate what the movie is about. I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this movie before watching the series. I felt it was extremely corny and it didn't explain much of the action that happened."
3,Too much Astrophysics,"I guess I'm in the minority. I love reading science and I'm big into physics. But this book just didn't do it for me. Much too detailed exposition of astrophysics. Skip this one and read the (much) better ""The Last Three Minutes"" by Paul Davies for a very similar and much more enjoyable treatment of the death of the universe."
4,"Fun, but could use more evidence","This is a fun book and reads quickly. If you are high school level astronomy fan or older you should have no problems and a younger child could be guided through this book by an adult. It avoids math and doesn't assume an understanding of relativity or quantum mechanics. The theory is interesting and comprehensive the presentation is solid easy to understand and builds gradually.What is missing is any sort of evidence or explanation of mechanisms. For example the 4th phase is dominated by black holes losing mass due to Bekenstein-Hawking radiation. Yet there is no discussion of where this radiation comes from, why it exists, how black holes lose mass from it. Is it a wave, if so what frequency, or a steady pulse?I'd recommend the book since there is nothing similar and it is a good read. I just hope there is a 2nd edition with an appendix with more detail on the ""why"" of the author's theory."
5,Moving fast,"This is a good book for any adult going through a transition. The personal stories and savvy sisters advice make the book an enjoyable quick read. The content makes the book a great resource of information for all of life's many transitions. It was especially helpful to me with the chapter for spouses. My husband and I used the checklists for the beginning of some very important conversations and we've been married for lots of years. The last chapter, ""My mom lives in the basement"" was helpful in checking myself on how I support aging relatives.I'm over 50 and already retired, but the book is a great resource for me and I'm recommending it to friends."
5,wow,This is definitely not like any of the other cd's put out by squarepusher. He goes off from his normal jazz style and comes up with some great new material which is why I love this album.
4,Fun read Conan style,"I found this to be a fun read, editing errors aside. It reminded me of Conan style books with a health helping of magic. For what you get you can't beat the price."
4,Fascinating insights,"Elizabeth's unique experiences in Iraq (although somewhat dated at this point) provide fascinating insights into the culture. Given the general American ignorance of Middle Eastern Life, this honest account of a Western woman's experience is enlightening and educational. Once I finished this book, I immediately looked into ordering almost everything else Elizabeth Warnock Fernea wrote!"
4,Really helpful,"I was really irratied that they didnt let me know how they were sending the product, but when i emailed them they got back to me as soon as the book reached them and resent it to me free of charge and were very polite about everything. Overall i give them a A-/B+. Good job!"
3,An outsider's view falls short,"Fernea shows her ignorance from the beginning to the end of her stay in a small Arab village. This book speaks more on misconceptions than it does on cultural ethnography. Fernea uses many incorrect assumptions throughout the text. This book was interesting, but often frustrated me. I read it as part of a class on gender and sexuality in the middle east, and it was the least accurate of all books I read. The book is fairly well-written and illustrative of attitudes of Westerners in the time it was written. Although misleading about this villages culture, it provides a nice plotline. I would reccomend this book to someone looking for entertainment, but not for an accurate portrayal of middle eastern women."
5,this cd is one of the best punk records EVER,"Blistering paced tunes about the f'up world we live in...This CD got played at least ten thousand times in my teens...At the time MDC were the KIngs of Hardcore punk...every song on this offering is GREAT, a classic!!! If you only own 1 MDC cd it should be this one. If you only want to own 1 hardcore punk cd, this one is arguably the best choice..."
5,Next best thing...,"This is the next best thing to a re-issue of Bobbie's brilliant final album ""Patchwork."" ...This CD sounds fine, so let's not quibble about the wonderful gift of music it provides. I'd pay an extra $50 if it included the ""Patchwork"" cut ""But I Can't Get Back"" which is one of the sweetest, most haunting recordings of my remote youth, but as is, this is a terrific collection. A fitting tribute to a wonderful artist, a magnificent woman, and one of the most tragically complete disappearing acts in show biz history."
4,"At the very least, sehr interessant!","This is not exactly the most useful German reference book in existence, but for the German speaking linguistician, this is a good find. I am a German major and I have engaged in taking Linguistics, and I must say that this book is a delight to read. The comparison and contrasting of idioms between English and German is attention grabbing, especially when you know that phrases like, ""Like father, like son"" and ""der Apfel faellt nicht weit von dem Baum"" have like idiomatic meanings, but they aren't similar at all literally. I'd recommend it for the 3rd year German high school student on up. It's interesting and you just might learn something."
3,Bring back the stuff I remember.,"Yeah, it's great, all these new tracks. Really super. Nice expansion. Now give me ""E.T. and Me"" and the proper version of ""Over the moon,"" pretty please. I miss them sorely. I miss all of the way it was. Like old friends lost in time. It's nice to go back, sometimes; to do something I couldn't do when first I saw the movie and took a piece of it home with me and let it sing me to sleep: to remember. I want to go back for just a little while. This new CD is no door to those days. It's nice. Nice for new memories. But I do so miss the way it was ...."
5,One of the best,"Any Williams fan who doesn't have this cd yet, is truly missing out. His marvelous orchestrations of E.T.'s adventures with Eliot are simply superb. After listening to the long track 17, it becomes very evident that William's music was so deserving of its oscar. This soundtrack contains an additional 30 minutes that was not present on the previous version of E.T. All the new songs are equally effective. On a sour note, however, this cd does not offer the beautiful E.T. and Me track, which was on the previous cd! Still, buy this one!"
5,"Backgrounds, mecha's, and manga creation","A complement to the earlier editions of this series, this book teaches you how to draw mecha's (daily machines), nature and animal characters, rounding off on how to put together a short story. There are helpful tips such as time-savers when drawing effective backgrounds even if there is less detail. The book is geared towards the aspiring mangaka, showing how drawings begin in sketches, inked, and toned in a step-by-step manner.All in all, this book is more for the person interested in drawing manga. Not recommended for the average learner who just wants to draw manga style and not interested in creating a manga."
5,The Best for the Holidays,These dishes are just the greatest for Christmas. They're bright and beautiful as well as so convenient being dishwasher safe!
2,DRY AS A BONE- I FEEL VERY DROWSY,"The author definitely did her homework, I give her kudos for that but I actually felt embarrassed for her because she exalted herself over such a great number of artists that tower over her in their accomplishments with her criticisms and dismissal of their work, making her seem silly at best- pompous at worst. It's as if all of these geniuses didn't get it at all, but she does? (Could it be because they are male?) Also- if you're looking for any spiritual fulfillment you won't find it here- it is strictly an academic work, and dry as a bone. I got so drowsy reading it today that I had to go outside for a walk."
2,A good idea spoiled by a boring writer,"The idea of travelling from port to port sounds like an exciting prospect. And it probably would be a great subject for a book if undertaken by anyone with any sense of adventure or, better yet, someone with more degenerate qualities than McCamish. There is no question that such a voyage, especially one that is essentially arranged by a travel agent on the writer's behalf, is not going to necessarily live up to the cartoonish view of salty seamen brawling and whoring (although a fair share of the latter appears to have survived). However, the adventure is a basically sound concept that would have been better had it been vicariously lived through someone who was completely willing to immerse themselves into it instead of calling his wife at every port and trying to avoid prostitutes. McCamish's story is that of an obviously well-to-do Australian keeping an arms length distance from his subject."
2,"Don't bother, there is much better DM out there","This band is overrated, plain and simple. Skill of the musicians aside, this is just average. I know there are alot of Death fans out there but there is so much better out there as far as death metal goes. If you are gonna get into death metal, i would suggest ""Seven Churches"" from Possessed or even Dark Angle's ""Darkness Decendes"" which borders between thrash and death metal respectivly. However there is also much worse death metal then this like Cannible Corpse. I agree that they were talented and all, its just that you can get way better then this."
3,Pregnancy Journal,This book was in Good shape. I felt the Journal wasn't to organized or easy to find things.Not my favorite Journal.
4,Pretty cool story,Good story. Don't believe I've ever seen a ghoul flick before. Acting is a little amateurish but I can work with it. I love low budget horror. One quibble - and it's a tough one - sound track has a delay that makes watching kind of tiring.
5,Great CD,"I find a lot of soundtracks to be not very good or well put together. The Bad Boys II Soundtrack does not fit in these catagories. P. Diddy did an outstanding job with overseeing the production of this album. The artist on this album were also outstanding. Artist include P. Diddy, Jay-Z, Loon, Biggie, 50 Cent, Nelly, Justin Timberlake and many more. This is a great soundtrack for a great movie so don't hesitate in buying it."
2,Why the hype,"This CD is garbage. With the exception of SYTF, nothing else is even worth being considered a single. I bought it because of the hype and wanting to hear DA Band's first joint (3/5). This CD has no flow, rythm or consistency. I was amazed at how horrible this entire CD was. I can't beleive puff allowed most of these tracks to make it on the CD. I've already filed it away. Don't buy this at any price. The songs that are being played out on the radio are the only ones worth listening to. Take away JZ and Freeway's played out joints, all you have is throw away. I demand a refund!!"
1,Bad Boys II soundtrack,If you love P.Diddy and just love sik beats this cd is for u! This cd includes club bangers and if like the R+B just go buy this now! This is the best soundtrack ever for any movie!TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!
1,Horrible quality,"I upgraded my ThinkPad T30 memory and just under 3 months, it caused my Windows XP to crash with a blue screen error. After removing the memory, things returned to normal."
1,Awful service,Company will not answer e-mails about failed products or honor warrenty. Very poor customer service
2,Pushed one topic only,"I was very intrigued to start reading ""Frauen"" after completing ""The Good War"" by Terkel. I was disappointed by the book for two reasons; one is that she always pounded the point, ""How did you feel about the Jews?"" I realize this was an important part of WWII but it was not the only thing. These women had interesting things to say without being pushed in one direction. The other reason I didn't enjoy this book was that the tempo was staggering. It took five pages to say what could be said in two. It was an interesting book. I just can't say I liked it."
5,Acu-rite 00616 instead,"I cannot comment on this unit, but I have had the Acu-rite 00616 for four years in the Seattle area and now back in Florida. This has been a five star unit but alas the receiving unit just died. Battery life was like a once a year endeavor. I hope that Amazon will again stock it. In the meantime, I did find one on Ebay and am having it shipped. If you can lay your hands on one, you will not be disappointed."
1,Battery Eater,"The money you save initially by buying this model, quickly gets offset by replacing batteries in the transmitter every week. This is a poor design and I am very disappointed in AcuRite for not pulling it off the market. They are still being sold. Do not buy..."
3,it's ok,"it works fine, but it's not the best quality. the face is a 'sticker' and mine was on a little crooked, and the black wrought iron is more of a dark brown. but what do you expect for $20. it's still cute and the swinging pendulum works fine and it keeps the time accurately, so I don't regret my purchase."
4,CooL,COOL it was easyly scratched but good color easy functions overall CooL! IT is very water proff to. also dim indiglo.
5,An absolute must read for the X generation,"I loved this book so much I decided to write my Master's Thesis in Literature on it; we've all got parents, friends, or someone we know that turn up in every one of these stories. Munro's insights into how humans deal with relationships, death, and collective community social consciousness are continually profound and eye-opening. Pay special attention to things ""Gothic"" in this collection as in Open Secrets: repressed sexuality, pleasurable dread, anxiety, remorse, unnatural silences....the list goes on and on. No-one better captures the paradox of connected everyday surfaces and hidden, underground nightmares than Munro."
2,Read the book !,"I red the book few months back and it was grate. But sadly , the movie did not capture the feelings and the magical moments of Bobby and Ted. It's kind of like a summary of the whole story ( which is part of a lager story that follow each individual in this first part called ""Hearts in Atlantis"" into there adulthood.)"
3,????,"Has Anthony Hopkins ever had a poor performance on the silver screen? NO. Has Anthony Hopkins ever stared in a poor performance? Hmm. Don&#65533;t get me wrong, Hearts in Atlantis is a good movie; a good movie to rent. The movie suffers from too much beginning and end, and not enough in the middle. Just as the boy begins to venerate Hopkins and understand the ""gift"" acquired, the movie moves to a close. Quality acting, but not enough WOW. Hopkins- 10 Stars, Hearts in Atlantis- 3 Stars, Hearts in Atlantis Rental + a take home pizza, 5 Stars."
3,"Good, but not great.","Perhaps my expectations were too high, given that I've thoroughly enjoyed some of King's other stories that have been made into dandy films (Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, etc.) All performances here are solid, yet some of the dialog seemed mildly contrived. And I couldn't help but detect some creepy Hannibal-isms in Hopkins' performance. My wife liked the film better than I did, which is unusual since I'm more prone to like a melancholy, bittersweet loss-of-childhood-innocence tale, which this is. I just never got drawn in. Still, there's not much to find objectionable, and so it's worth checking out."
2,"Skip this movie, unless you've read the book...","Reviews of movies based in whole or in part on novels are replete with warnings like, ""Not nearly as good as the book,"" or ""Don't waste your time on the movie, just read the book."" In the case of Hearts in Atlantis, the movie just doesn't make sense if you haven't read the book. From a performance standpoint, and as a ""coming of age"" story, the movie gets 4 stars. But for the story, where it would be nice to know about the Breakers and Low Men in Yellow Suits, the movie absolutely fails. Folks, there's a whole lot more to the story than what you get with this movie... so, you might want to skip this one, unless you've read the book."
2,Wastin yo time,"Hello all. I must say, this movie does NO justice to the book. I can't stand the fact that it ""rushes' through every important character and leaves you with Anthony Hopkins describing some BS to a kid. Of course, when AT character says it's the CIA looking for him, the story doesn't break a beat. However, in the book, this story is a part of a whole series (see other's). I don't want to kill everything for a ""layman"", but this holds no grounds in my case."
4,Pleasant Afterthoughts,"This is a typical SK storyline. Suprising, Unexpected and Odd with great...FANTASTIC cinimatography. Very moody!. Anthony Hopkins is GREAT in EVERYTHING he does and has ever done including this. Even the scenes that seemed pointless, underdone and overdone went by with the blink of an eye due to this mans presence. Even his trance like states that he went into on occasion made up for any lack of dialouge. I have always been a King fan and am constantly amazed at his versatility. It may not have been a GREAT movie, but it was good and very entertaining. The storyline involving the young adults was utterly charming and lifelike. There is nothing better than seeing a movie that leaves you with pleasant afterthoughts. My biggest dissapointment in the film was I missed seeing Mr. King's cameo appearence as a bartender, priest, geek or truckdriver or other incognito extra."
1,Horrible and unclimatic,"Hi everyone,A couple of nights ago i found myself going to the movie rental place in our local town, probably to select a gory and extremly scary horror film from some great author such as Stephan King ( I have everybook ever written by him) and my day was completely enlightend when the clerk told me she had just recieved a copy of hearts in atlantis, i rented it went home made a big bowl of popcorn and sat down expecting a great film made by the king of kings in horror & thriller movies, what i got was over barring, gut wrenching FILTH it was horrible i would have watched a science documentary before that if i would have known what i was about to watch. TH whole FBI thing was way out of line, the homosexual bully wasnt needed , and it followed the book on a mere couple seconds. I defintitly will think twice on renting a movie before i check out the reviews."
2,Half a book in film format!,"How can they call it ""Hearts In Atlanta"" when the title was based on playing the card game ""Hearts"" while at college in Atlanta! If they ever complete the film I will not be wasting my money going to see it. This smells of the ploy King used with the Green Mile book series and then the internet book saga. Ether make a film and include all the essential elements of the story (not just part 1) or don't bother. Great way of making you pay twice for watching one film. Wait until they bring out part 2 (part 3) and get the whole thing when it gets transferred to a TV mini series.VERY DISSAPOINTED"
3,Beware the Lo Mein,"Um. There's a lot missing from this movie. Real suspense. Genuine psychological drama? Something actually interesting happening with the Low Men? The whole time I felt like there was someone whispering behind me -- ""Sleep."" ""Sleep."" ""Sleep."" Which had me fighting to pay closer attention, hoping to be rewarded with at least a smidgen of newfound insight by the conclusion. The only thing I got was Mika Boorem in a bad wig trying to pass herself off as Carol Gerber's daughter. I was too distracted by the wig to hear what she said. Maybe I'm too old for this film. Then again, when I was Bobby Garfield's age I was watching ""Stand by Me,"" a King adaptation I still enjoy, and would recommend over this one."
2,"Great soundtrack, but something missing overall...","Just watched this movie for the second time and remembered why I didn't add it to my list of favorite films. The movie has the potential to be great but seems to try too hard to be another ""Shawshank Redemption"", losing focus and glossing over parts of the film that might deserve more, while paying too much attention in other areas that don't improve the viewer's experience.The oldies-filled soundtrack is one of the best things going for the movie, offering familiar and mostly upbeat tunes, even if the placement might feel too obvious. Others have mentioned what a fantastic job the younger actors do, and Anthony Hopkins is competent here, though it has to be noted that he wasn't working with stellar material to begin with.Overall, Hearts in Atlantis offers some good scenes and music, but serious Stephen King and Anthony Hopkins fans are likely to be disappointed."
3,Not one of King's best,"I never thought Hearts in Atlantis was one of King's best, and unfortunately the movie confirmed that. Despite being a likable movie, the child actors simply were bad, seeming bored with the roles to which they had been assigned. Hopkins, Morse, and the mother were decent, however. Some movies attempt to compensate with a good soundtrack and an atmospheric feel to it, but you need more ingredients than this to make a good flick."
2,If you've already read the book...,"... this will be a very disappointing film. Only the first segment of the book is covered - Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan. The characters are well-portrayed - Bobby, his mother, Carol, and Anthony Hopkins as Brautigan. Hence my two-star rating. But the rest of King's fine book - Bobby's depression and descent into juvenile delinquincy, Pete Riley and Carol at college, Carol's transformation into the political radical ""Red Carol,"" the ""penance"" of ""Blind Willie"" Shearman, and John Sullivan's bizarre death - are all missing. We're told at the end of the film that Carol is dead. The final reunion, which so beautifully concluded the book, is also missing. Bobby never hears from Brautigan again - no rose petals. It's hard to believe that King allowed this stripped-down version to be filmed. Even the title - ""Hearts In Atlantis"" - is meaningless in the context of this film. I thought King cared more about his work than this."
2,Lackluster effort,"I love Anthony Hopkins, but this movie just did not move me. I watched and watched, fully expecting the plot and characters to become more gripping, but it just never materialized. This very well may be the weakest film I've seen with Sir Tony. The plot manipulations are rampant and sentimentalism the norm in this formulaic effort."
3,Nothing too taxing here.,"I gave it three stars based on it's value to me personally. This is strictly for the beginner in my opinion. Any intermediate worth his salt could take the basic boogie line in E (You know the one!) and come up with 25 simple variations in no time. Probably half of them would match ones in this book. And the other half would be just as good. Some of the lines have riffs in them also but still not too difficult. Again, for the beginner only!"
2,Works but flawed,"The product works but seems to need to ""warm up"" before the picture comes in without blanking in and out."
2,This imbicile couldn't grow weeds,This book is a bunch of rehashed crap packaged as something unique. I think that Mr Bell's brain must have been replaced with composting pig manure when he wrote it. If your garden is the size of a flower pot and you live in an ideal environment then you only spend 60 minutes a week on the whole thing. But I live in the real world where I spent more than 60 minutes one week alone diagnosing a fungus on my tomato plants. This book doesn't even cover important topics such as that. This book is crap the one thing it is good for is shredded compost.
5,Amazing historical trivia,"This is not deep reading, but really interesting historical information not found in text books. Perfect for me. I have a tendency of getting hooked on a book and everything else stops. This is a book of many different stories, so I could put it down and then pick it up with no problems. Loved it. Fun summer read!"
3,DISHY READING FOR A DAY AT THE BEACH or A SHORT FLIGHT,"Sure, I enjoy a challenging 3 1/2 pound book on British history as much as the next person, (The Isles by Norman Davies, for instance) but I also like to cuddle up to a real TRASHY READ!That's what this book is.... AND I LIKED IT!! I was familiar with most of the stories but Michael Farquhar has an amusing ""enquirer-ish"" style of writing that is most enjoyable. And his chapter headings are a HOOT...""Until Divorce or Decapitation Do Us Part"" (Henry VIII).The chapters are pretty short and you can pop open just about any page & not be lost. Did I mention disgusting characters?? Just about EVERY ONE OF 'EM. This bunch make the Royals of today look like ""chump change"".Fun reading.... and if you don't already know these folks this book makes you want to find out more about them."
3,Very entertaining view of royal scandals,"This book is full of very quick tales of royal scandals. The book is full of thumbnail sketches of various royal personages and all of their quirks and foibles. It is amazing how much scandal the author manages to pack into such a small volume. It was very quick reading and very entertaining, but don't expect any kind of in-depth stories."
2,Shallow,Unfortunately the author demonstrated the intellectual rigour of a man who has found himself writing for the children's section of the Washington Post - not that that is not a perfectly acceptable journalistic endeavour. My children enjoyed him in the past so I thought it might be worth my time and money to give his adult fare a go. However I was terribly disappointed. Perhaps he should write for a Hollywood scandal sheet or tabloid and not endeavor to pen anything that might be mistaken for documented nonfiction. Very little effort to validate his tales taken with his emphasis on a snappy quick read should have confined him to writing for magazines in serial form. Sorry I gave it much consideration.
2,Nearly not dirty enough.,"We all know European monarchs and royals were bunch of perverts. So, as an astute student of dishing the dirt on historical figure, I picked up this book. I was ready for some sick stuff that would make Monica Lewinski's dress look sanitary.I was wrong. This book is too nice. Stories were filtered and all you get is a glimpse of those sick people and their dirty deeds.Not worth your time and money. Move on to the next one on your list."
4,"Fun and entertaining, not academic but worth the read","I enjoyed this book. I never tried to take it seriously and I think that's why it was so fun. Since I wasn't enrolled at Princeton I knew ahead of time not to expect total accuracy and since the title is fun why would anyone think otherwise. It was the kind of book you can read, put down, and go back to over time. It was something you had to committ to but it was fun and I learned quite a bit about those wonderful royals."
1,"Junk - never worked, put new batteries etc.",I bought this about six months ago. It never worked properly. I changed the batteries in the main unit as well as in the bell but this POS never worked for me. I have the main unit within ten feet of the door. It rings once every ten times the button is pushed as installed. It skips the chime even when the units are right next to each other. What a piece of garbage!UPDATED - I got a replacement after i wrote to HeathCo. The replacement worked well but in cold weather the performance is suspect. Doesn't work always. Stay away and spend more if you want reliability.
4,A one man show,"He didin't need a bunch of dancers, set changes and guest appearances. It was a one man show. R Kelly demonstrated why he has been on top of his game for 15 years and running. The only problem was that he didn't perform ""Honey Love"" which is my favorite RKelly song, so i gave him 4 stars. Other than that...i had no complaints."
3,EXPECTED MUCH MORE,"C'MON R, YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS TO LONG TO JUST GIVE US you grabbing the mic and SINGING ALL NITE LONG, no dancing, no ladies(tastfully dress), no showmanship. I EXPECTED your #1s to at least get an extended concert mix. You could have cut the ""fillers"" from the show and did this. I was more entertained by your music videos than the concert. Buy the dvd with ""step in the name of love"" much more entertaining."
2,Lacking,"Not even close to the masterpiece ""opposite of december"". There are moments of solidarity to the music, but mostly the songs meander and never really take hold. This is not a wise purchase. Get ""opposite"" and you will understand the potential that could have been."
4,"Not ""Opposite Of December,"" but it still rules","While ""Tear From The Red"" isn't quite the unmitigated classic that its predecessor ""Opposite of December"" was, it still exemplifies all the same characteristics that make Poison The Well such a great band. Songs like ""Botchla,"" ""Lazzaro,"" and ""Rings From Corona"" display the complex song structures, gut-wrenching vocals, and addictive melodies that any PTW fan would expect. They also expand on the occasional acoustic moments from ""Opposite of December"" (especially with the all-acoustic ""Horns and Tails), and they include one track of Marlon Brando's legendary monologue from ""Apocalypse Now."" I happen to prefer ""Opposite of December,"" but this is still a worthy pickup."
4,Good but Opposite of December is Better,"This is a good CD. Unfortuantely it moves away from hardcore and is more like a screamo CD. It is missing that heavy music of Opposite of December. However, this CD has better bass and vocal production but is a lot worse in the guitar department. Jeremy Staska did something amazing with Opoosite of December giving it raw power with guitars that sound like a helicopter that just pounded with brural heaviness. This CD is more targeted towards the mainstream audience and lacks the emotion that Opposite of December had. My reccomendation is to skip this one and buy their Opposite of December CD instead. The songs on this CD sound much better live so go see them."
1,"This is good, if you like anything BUT Poison The Well","Do Not Get this album. This is NOT Poison the Well. The band has become slower and the songs simpler. I LOVE the old Poison the Well stuff because of Jeff's vocals. In this album, the vocals aren't good. I found that the tempo of this album was really slow. All the songs sound the same. There are only two good songs, the first and the last. There is even a ""Dashboard Confessional""-wannabe song with Jeff and an acoustic guitar. When I purchase a Poison the Well album, I want Poison the Well. I do not want some cheap over-produced album where all the songs sound the same."
3,Y&T - Straight at You Rock,"Not having been much of a Y&T fan over the years, I listened to this CD and found a lot of good, raw rock'n'roll. Rescue Me, Dirty Girl and Forever are very good. The intro on Black Tiger is good, the song is okay. Fun stuff hits with Lipstick and Leather and Summertime Girls.A good comparison for me regarding Y&T would be Helix. The Best Of Y&T 81-85 is worth picking up and then crankin' up!"
4,Not bad,Dont forget bungee cords or something similar to hold stuff in place.Does well what it is designed to do but you can get it for $15.00 to $20.00 less at Costco
4,good deal,pros:It looks really good and can be stored easily.Has a sturdy designcons:The metal base which holds the boxes is slightly small. So your boxes have to be small for this to work best.
2,Didn't work at all for my application,"After all of the glowing reviews, I picked up one of these with high expectations. Unfortunately, the wheel placement results in a center of gravity that makes it unusable and unmanageable for small heavy loads - will be returning to the big box store from whence it came."
5,Great little cart,This is a great little cart. I don't think I can say more than what has already been said. The only thing is if you have a Costco card then make sure to buy it there. They sell it for only $20. That's $15 cheaper than what Amazon is selling it for!!
4,Light weight and does what it says!,I like this! Very easy to maneuver and holds some large packages! I got it within a few days of ordering and this one sure is much better than the old luggage cart with stretch straps that would always get dirty because they have to be put down on the ground while getting the items onto the cart before securing. The magna cart is SO much better - total piece of cake - just pull up on the handle and with your foot pull down the platform and it folds up just as easily. It's so slender that the storage of this is really compact too. I'm glad I got this. I have a very bad back and it's made it so much easier hauling things around.
2,MagnaCart broke my front teeth!,"Imagine my shock when, the first time I used my new MagnaCart, I lost significant portions of both my top front teeth! I was setting a second box on top of one I'd already placed on the cart. When I put the second box down, the cart's handle whipped forward, broke my teeth, and gave me a fat lip.So be careful, MagnaCart users! Don't let what happened to me happen to you."
1,Hard to review,Unfortunately I am unable to review this item due to the fact that it was stolen from my front door. I have yet to set eyes on it.
4,Very useful!,"I bought the Magna Cart (would Charlemagne be offended?) to use daily at work. I repair medical equipment, and often need to carry parts and deep-cycle batteries to the equipment, along with my tool bag. The cart is nice and lightweight, and is easily stowed in my van when not needed. And it will easily carry a box of parts, my tool bag, and creeper stool at once. Batteries can be pretty heavy (up to 60 pounds each), so I'm pretty careful when carrying more than one with the cart. So far it's performed very well.My co-worker bought one at the same time I did, and tested it out carrying 120 pounds of batteries. It went fine, until he went over a door threshold, and the top handle popped off on one side. As a result, I've been more careful with mine in such situations.I'm 6' tall, and the handle is a good height.My only gripe, and it's a gripe about Amazon more than anything else, is that after I got my cart, the local Home Depot started carrying them, for $5 less than Amazon."
3,To be expected for the price.,"The MagnaCart can't hold more than two boxes or else it bends under the weight. It also doesn't extend tall enough to walk with comfortably. If you walk with it the way one normally would with a dolly, it will bend and torque so you're forced to flatten it so the weight spreads onto more of the extension. The wheels are the main problem. They aren't large enough for the size of the cart."
4,Magna Cart Good for little small items,"I bought this to help me move into my apartment, it works good no complaints.. And it is way stronger than you think it would be.Pros: Lightweight, compact, strongCons: Unlike a real hand truck, there isnt really a spot you can place your foot to tilt the load backwards, not to mention the bottom is slightly narrow.Overall, I would buy this again."
4,Stands up to constuction use,I use this cart to haul tools and materials in my work as a carpenter. I've had it stacked with crates of power tools and 100 pound doors with no problems. It folds up nice and flat and takes up very little room in my already packed truck.
3,The old-time Brand Name Cookbook,I am disappointed in this book. Yes the pictures are great and the stories too. It's the recipes that I found disappointing. There is not one that I would take the time or money to make. In fact there is a few I have never heard of. It if you like pictures and stories get this book. Don't bother with the recipes.
3,Just too short,"This book really needed, in my opinion, to be longer. It's quite short, and the plot is quite minimal. It feels like the introduction to a larger story. There is very little closure of the story at the end. You feel like something else has to happen, but it doesn't.Instead of just having Equality saying what he plans to do to change his world, I think it should go into him doing it. If the story had been extended a little, it would have been a lot better.The story is effective, though. The message is incredibly potent, but the story seems unfinished."
3,Neither the best of Rand nor of the dystopian genre,"I am a big fan of Ayn Rand, and I love dystopian literature, so I expected to be blown away by Anthem. Instead, I was quite disappointed. It seems as though Rand read Evgeny Zamyatin's We (published over a decade before Anthem) and penned a much weaker version of her own."
5,Excellent Story!,"This is an excellent book that will make you look at your life in a different way. Never again will you take anything for granted, and god forbid this is how we all end up. In a world where we and us is known, the single word ""I"" is uttered and then lost . . . Another book of interest that I have read which made me view life in a different manner was Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut. Another excellent choice of reading!"
4,"Short, but great read!!","This is again yet another GREAT book by Ayn Rand. It's much shorter than her other books (Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged) but still very interesting. I liked the plot but things were not as developed as in her other books. But this is to be expected since Anthem is so short. If you are just starting to get into Ayn Rand, this would be a good place to start."
1,And yet we continue to wear our masks and ignore our hearts.,"Ayn Rand's society is one of greed where we wear the masks of our ego and hide our true feelings while we follow our ego. It is a loveless society where the male figure takes control over the female and has complete power in his relationship w/her, which is based purely on physical attraction. She is infactuated w/him and admires him so much that she gives herself to him and allows him to take control of her. Lets not even think about what she feels or what she is thinking, she is merely a follower of the more supreme being-the brave, strong, courageous man."
4,"Not my politics, but","Ayn Rand did not share my politics, but even I can appreciate this short novel. The writing is strong and full of themes, and this is a book that will really make you think about collectivism. I recommend it to anyone; particularly high-schoolers or other young readers who are exploring different views (provided a parent or mentor can provide balance)."
4,"A short, very interesting book","I had never heard of this book before I was given it for summer reading, but it is an extremely interesting, thought provoking book. It's a very quick read, it took me about an hour, and Ayn Rand has some very interesting points that she gets across quickly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a kind of peculiar, thought provoking, quick read."
4,ESSENTIAL RAND,"This book is an essential addition to anyone interested in the philosophy of Ayn Rand. If you have yet to read any of her works, I believe this to be your best starting point. In this beautiful prose poem lay the gems of Objectivism. I consider this a short, stabbing introduction to Rand's beliefs, especially when compared to ""Atlas Shrugged"", which is much, much wider in scope and runs about 1100 pages longer. ""Anthem"" is the warm up lap before the marathon. If you want to see what Objectivism is all about, read this book. If you want to go further from there, then read ""Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged""."
2,Not the best dystopia book!,"Read Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World instead. Although short (you don't have to suffer the endless tirades of Atlas Shrugged), I had problems keeping attention through the whole book. Rand has a very boring writing style. Moreover, I have to admit, I had the disturbing, cultic, sheepish following of Rand's ""philosophy"" in my mind all the time."
3,This classic dystopia is not too original,"I have read many dystopias and this is definately the most standard. There is not much original in the book, and a book that barely reaches the 100-page mark, like this one, is not going to have that many sophisticated ideas. Reading Farenheit 451 or 1984 would be a much wiser decision."
2,"Anthem was okay. It wasn't good, but I read it.","Rand definitely has an ""ego problem."" Why was ego such a special word? The book was pretty good - not a strong plot(at all), but readable - up to that point. Then she went on and on about ego! Where's the plot in that? Anthem is on our Required Reading List for high school, but I absolutely cannot understand why. I would rather read 1984 or The Giver any day."
5,A must-have for any Rand lover.,"Anthem is a wonderful book. While not near as meaty as Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead, it still has the ability to capture ones heart. If you haven't read it, read it. While it certainly could be read before any of Rand's other work, I still am forced to believe that Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead are even more pivotal. Buy and enjoy."
4,Strange but cool,"I got this from Kindle because it was free and looked like a quick read from an interesting author, and it was. A futuristic tale showing a socialistic culture to the max. Very interesting read and short enough to give it a chance without investing too much time into it. I enjoyed it, as it is a bit psuedo sci-fi as well."
3,"Quick review, no Spoilers","When reading this book one must take into account that Ayn Rand had only just begun to gain a full understanding of English, and the book was written in the style in which it is written to reach all readers. This being said, Anthem uses very basic words, poor plot, and is exceedingly short (which may be nice to some people). The book does have some significant value however, Anthem was the precursor to such books as 1984, and related books, only in a much shorter form. Leading me to recommend this book for people who wish to be introduced to objectivism, as well as a much shorter, simpler version of 1984. I would not recommend this book for people wishing to read a well written story, or for those who wish to be introduced to Ayn Rand's work and have a reading level above the fifth grade."
4,"A true ""Anthem"" to man's spirit","I found this book lying on the floor in the band area of my high school. I have a tendancy to take books if they are unclaimed for a week, and this one had been there for two. Think of Anthem as the spirit of both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged: condensed and stripped of all words but the ones which matter. In other words, poetry. I'm using Anthem as my piece for speech this year; it is beautiful and terrible, exhalting and disturbing, sweet and bitter. This book is a probably the best one of Rand's books to start with. If you dislike Anthem, you will most likely not be able to read through Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged."
1,Ayn Rand's Anthem,"I just finished Ayn Rand's 'Anthem'. Anthem reflects the emotional outlook of a small child, systematized by an adolescent, somewhat eloquently expressed by a thirty-something. Boiled down to its essence Anthem is Nietsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra for complete idiots. If Alan Greenspan is really a disciple of Ayn Rand it's no wonder that he helped run the economy into a ditch."
1,"Been there, done that.","When I was younger I thought that this book was amazing. Now I realize that it's just a cheap rip-off of Brave New World. Shame on you, Ayn."
2,A tolerable writing excercise by Rand.,"Listen, this work cannot be properly understood with first reading ""WE"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin.Rand readers struggle with the purpose of this book. It is merely a writing exercise, an annotation and partial re-write of ""We."" There were certain philosophical elements which Rand disagreed with in Zamyatin, so she wished to set out a bit of prose to complement it.The book does not stand on its own without Zamyatin's.We"
2,Absurd leap,"So the automatic reaction to totalitarian collectivism is radical individualism and the worship of ""EGO""? I can't believe such simpleminded notions have the vast influence they currently have in American politics. Hogwash."
3,Gag me with gag me with a spoon!,"If I'm not mistaken, Anthem was conceived and written BEFORE Orwell's 1984."
1,The worst book I've read in my life,"This is far and away the worst book that I've read cover-to-cover in my life. It purports to demonstrate the ""logical outcome"" of collectivism, and fails miserably at this task. What's more, it's written in a ""biblical"" or mythical tone, something that Rand does not pull off in the least. This book succeeds much better when read as a critique of Rand, as her ideas are potrayed in an utterly pathetic manner.To be fair, this is one of her earlier works, when she was still experimenting as a writer and at expressing herself in English. I was inspired to read it after having read her excellent novel on individualism, ""The Fountainhead"". If interested in reading some Rand, I very strongly recommend that you read that book instead. To make it clear: I don't hate Rand; I hate pretentious writing and philosophical work that consists of constructing flimsy strawmen and tearing them down."
4,A Great View of an Alternate World,"This book was pretty great; it was short, concise, and eye-opening. It showed a world that most people fear living in, yet we are heading towards. Ms. Rand's ideas are extreme, but she gets her point across. The only bad part about the book was it's preachiness, and the huge intro and end of the book. Overall, if you like being introduced to new ideas and don't have a ton of time, this book is a great choice."
1,Review of Kindle free edition,First thjnfs first I love Anthem. However the Kindle free edition is missing fhe most important line. I'm sure you can find a better copy elsewhere for your kindle. either projectguttenburg or archive likely have a copy that is complete.
5,A must read for teens and up.,"This is one of books that you should read each time you face a life changing event. It is a short read, but once you finish reading it you will be compelled to do some serious soul searching. In doing so, you will be able to put your lifes event in proper perspective."
2,Great book - terrible narrator (go with the other Anthem audio),"Having listened to both unabridged audio versions of Anthem, the one read by Paul Meier is far superior. Christopher Lane is MONOTONE. It felt like a chore to listen to! Paul Meier has a bit of passion when he reads, and the characters feel more alive. Lane's version is like listening to a lecture that you know is interesting, but want to fall asleep to because it is poorly presented.Save your money, and get the Anthem audiobook read by Paul Meier."
5,great thinker,Ayn Rand was a great thinker and this short yet profound book is a beautiful example of her philosophy and her impact on modern thought.
2,This was a boring tale.,"I was forced to read ""Anthem"" for my English class. All that reading it did was make me despise the teacher even more. I found it to be very nondescript. I had no idea of what the setting was like. It only came to me in shades of grey. As for the plot, I found it rather boring. It had an important message about being an individual but it was not presented in an entertaining way. My advice to anyone with the opportunity of reading this is not to."
3,"It was a little weird, but it was a good book.","I think that this book was pretty good. At the beginning, I thought that it was really weird. The ""we"" concept was a little hard to grasp. It took me a while to understand that all pronouns were collective, and there were no singular pronouns. As the book went on, I think it got a lot better. This was a very futuristic book, similar to the giver. I think this book is a very good example of what would happen if no one expresses their individuality. I liked that Liberty and Equality ended up together. I also think that something that is very ironic is that all of the names in the book have to do with freedom or individuality, even though the World Council didn't want people to be individual. I also think that it would be cool to read another book by Ayn Rand."
5,Good Album.,It really should be four and a half but four stars wouldn't do it justice. The production isn't up to par with the next three releases but it doesn't stop the album from being good. Splinters is a great song and Apalindrome has an interesting Tribal feel to it. Not much else to say about it. Buy it if you like Post-Hardcore meets Classic Metal.
5,You got Heavy Metal in my Hardcore...,"Yes, hardcore meets early '90s heavy metal meets the emerging ""alternative"" scene with Into Another. Richie from Underdog provides great vocals with guitar solos & metal crunching.I was *really* into this album when it came out, and loved their live show, but listening to it now it sounds dated. Its an interesting amalgam of sounds that were popular in the early '90s."
5,Nokia BLC_2 Battery,This battery saved me from buying a new phone which I didn't want to do.. The I got immediate shipping.... Great service. Thanks!!!!
4,Battery replacementThe,The initial battery that was ordered proved to be dective and would not take a charge. I ntified the company that supplied the battery and they immediately sent a replacement which functions satisfactorily. I would do business with this company again. RDH
1,Disappointed,This battery would not fully charge. I purchased two batteries and neither would fully charge even when placed on the charger all night. I am very dissatified.
3,New battery??,I'm not seeing any difference in battery life between my old battery and this new one. I don't know if I have a phone problem or if this new battery is really an old one. I've been using this new battery now for a month. What I'm really wondering here is whether this battery has exceeded its shelf life and that's why it's being offered at such a low price.
1,Doesn't Hold Charge,The battery doesn't hold a charge for more than an hour of use so am planning to get a new phone since the one I have is several years old.
1,it is not working...,"When I opened the package, it looks like a used battery. My husband said it looks like someone just pulled it out of a phone.It is not working. After I charge it, the phone shows the full battery. But the phone is shut off in just few minutes.I tried to turn it back on, and the same thing happens.I can only use the phone if I keep it plugged in.I don't want to make a big deal of it, since I just spent $5. But just want to let other people know."
2,Need a fair mathematical background.,"Major steps were skipped. A reader without a fair mathematical background would not understand why suddenly a statistical result could be used to replace the whole martingale equation. A lot of assumptions were made on the knowledge base of readers. Therefore, it is not an introductory text. If the reader has a fair mathematical background the reader needs not start with this book. If the reader does not have the background, he can't understand this book. This book is in the middle of nowhere. In short, the authors skipped too many steps. An subjective opion: It seems to me that the authors were very lazy to type."
1,A TRIBUTE .....,"to the magnaminous tolerance of the Holy See is called to attention by this book and the fact that Sr. Sullivan has not been excommunicated for not recanting many of her opinions expressed in it. I respectfully criticize the prudential judgement of the Holy See for this excessive tolerance. If you want to read about Vatican II, read ""Catholic Matters"" by Fr. Richard John Neuhaus. He points out that the election of Cardinal Josef Ratzinger to the papal throne was the swan song of the likes of Sr. Sullivan, most of whom he points out are now ""toddling about the nursing home garden reminiscing about their Church which will never be."" Want proof of who's winning: Sr. Sullivan's book: Amazon sales rank #501,479. Fr. Richard John Neuhaus's Catholic Matters #148,258. THE SPIRIT OF VATICAN II IS DEAD, THANK THE LORD. LONG LIVE POPE BENEDICT XVI."
4,A Great Guide!,"Whew...I'm tired from reading this book! There are SO MANY ideas here. There are NO suggestions for where to get things online since the Copyright date is 1994. But, there are lots of 800 numbers. There is a section on Romance and Erotica if that is what you are looking for. The book is divided into sections based on gift type but there is also a quick reference section based on price. Unique ideas."
1,Pay a little more for one that will actually work !,"Got this is a timely mannor, put it in my phone, chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least ! I ordered this just in time to go into the hospital for a ce section so i wouldnt have to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull. A lot of good it did me."
4,Replacement cell phone battery,"Works great and fit like it is supposed to, charges and recharges quickly. When I need another one I will come back and order another"
2,u get what u pay for,"Bought this because AT&T wanted $45.00 for it in the store, when I needed to replace my 3 yr. old battery.. This one NEW doesn't hold a charge any better than my 3 year old one. But it is worth the $8.00 especially with PRIME shipping."
4,just what i needed,"Easy to find, easy to buy, just the right battery for my back-up phone. I would buy another if the need arises without thinking twice about it."
5,Excellent,Service and product are both what I exspected and I would use this seller again. The Hologram was present and Nokia was on the battery unlike the one that came with the product i had ordered.
4,Shipped items and made sure I was satisfied with their services,I originally reported that the item ordered was not delivered because the shipping address was not correct. Seller contacted me and shipped the items. They followed up to make sure the items were received and were in condition advertised.
1,This battery failed on me.,"I bought this battery in May 2011 via Amazon from ""The OEM Shop."" The battery completely failed in less than a month and would no longer take a charge. I suspect that the battery was reconditioned rather than new. Needless to say, I wasted my money."
1,Not for long term,"If you want a battery that last for more than 6 mths, go somewhere else. This stupid thing doesn't hold any charge anymore and it's not like the company is going to stand by their product."
4,Nokia Li-Ion Battery,"The battery works well, with no problems. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good Nokia BL-5C Extended Li-Ion Battery."
3,ok for the money,It took a week for one screw that connects belt clip to fall out. Others seems have loosened too. And their heads are too small to find a tool at home for tightening them.
4,Totally Cute!,"This book is really cute, and if you've broken up with somebody, you can totally relate to it! Its not a novel or an advice book... it is a mix of poems, diary entries, statements and advice. It is so funny! I enjoyed it and passed it on to all my friends, they thought it was hilarious too!! I was laughing out loud."
1,Yet another bitter man-hating feminist in denial,"Ms. Liberty misses a crucial fact: Women need to grow up and stop thinking that men who are abusive and unfaithful are ""sexy, bad boy challenges"". Men who would never dump her, and would treat her with the utmost respect and equality, are ridiculed and ignored on a daily basis by cowards like Ms. Liberty.Stop dating jerks. Start appreciating good guys. Case closed."
4,there is a more complete EMI references reissue of this material,"This material has been reissued by EMI, in their References collection, in 1989, in transfers by Keith Hardwick, and with the addition of Debussy's Minstrels (arrangement for violin and piano by Hartmann) and Fauré's Berceuse from Dolly. This is how I have it, and I've reviewed it in detail:Debussy, Faure and Franck. At the time of writing it is cheaper as well.Despite Thibaud's decidedly dated wailing portamentos, the interpretations are classics, with an irresistible Romantic sweep in Franck and Fauré, and a whimsical skittishness in Debussy. These are lessons in interpretation, too often forgotten (don't linger! don't fuss over details! Don't let the forward momentum sag!), from performers who had direct links with the composers."
4,Nice surprise,"Her voice is just ok, sounds a little like Emmylou Harris (although not nearly as good), but the songs are solid and I've enjoyed this CD more than I thought I would."
5,"Beautiful voice, excellent lyrics","I recently saw Bruce & the E-Street Band, and during the show each member sang a small piece of a song. I had never heard Patti solo (just as a background singer), and she had such a beautiful voice that I ordered Rumble Doll soon after the show. The songs are incredibly well-written and, in many cases, you can here how personal and emotional they are for Patti. My favorite cuts are Rumble Doll and My Imagination, but I really enjoy the entire CD. Bruce plays guitar on a couple of the tracks, but this is definitely all Patti. Awesome.."
3,"Beautiful, but difficult to use.","This items is very beautiful and well made, but I haven't been able to figure out a way to use it to hold my hairstyle together. It appears that you have to do your hair using other methods and then insert this as a decoration only. It may work best for women with lots and lots of hair than for those of us with normal amounts of hair. This vendor makes many more items just as beautiful that would work better."
5,It was very much like the home,This is a very realistic film of the mansion. We went there and I loaned the video to a friend and I haven't gotten it back. I can't remember which friend!!They must love it too because no one confess' to having it. I want another one!!
4,Not into guitar solos,"Even though I am not into guitar solos, I thoroughly enjoyed this album by Roy Buchanan. From Patsy Cline to Wilson Pickett, he has some covers that are fantastic. From Duane Eddy to Jimi Hendrix, Buchanan covers the range. Also, this is an album for when you want to kick back and relax. Enjoy."
5,It has all of Roys best songs,A lot of people may not know of Roy but true guitar aficionados will know of his work.He was asked to replace Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones when he died and preferred to play his own bluesy type of music.His 1954 fender telecaster combined with the fender twin reverb and the way he uses the volume control knob on his guitar to create the harmonics that almost sound like a violin and he uses every fret on the guitar going all the way down to the bridge and the speed of his riffs are amazing.A must buy for all guitar players to listen to and check him out on youtube and you will see what I mean about the control he has over his guitar !!!! Also check him out on wikipedia to find out more of his life before he died its fascinating.
4,Fun game,"Good game for the cube during its run, but I am not sure how it would hold up today. I think you would enjoy this game if your a fan of old school coin ops such as Dynamite Cop as it has that feel to it."
5,Living Proof---movie of hope.,"An excellent true story of drug research for breast cancer. It's enlightening as to all the battles fought in cancer research and the lives involved, lost and saved. Highly recommended."
1,Great price and shipping,Had to ship the first one back becasue it was misboxed but once I got the bra it fit like a glove and covered up blemishes on the front end.
5,Little Girl Blue Captured Live In New York City,"""Diana Ross is a fine singer. All you have to do is listen to her Billie Holiday stuff! It's marvellous!"" (Marvin Gaye).With time - two decades after the film - these songs have matured wonderfully in Diana's voice and touching reading. The concept is like good wine - it just gets better with time.She is still the greatest and most prominent performer of Holiday's songs and the Lady Sings the Blues segment remains an emotionally and artistic highlight in any concert she does. However, this is a rare chance to hear all the songs performed and recorded exclusively in a one-night-only concert at The Reds nightclub in New York City. The songs are really comfortable in N.Y. and they are certainly comfortable with Miss Ross and her great band. This is a fine and very wholesome CD - highly recommanded to any fan of Diana Ross and Jazz/Blues/Standards."
5,You'll definitly be fat footin' to this one,"The New York Ska Jazz Ensemble is a great band with members from the Toasters, Scofflows, and The Pietasters...and it's sure to get you off your feet. The songs are tight...and the musicians are great. Definitly one of my faveorites. It's a wonderful blend of both ska and jazz all in one...my fave. :)"
3,Was going to buy it but its made by sony,"heard him on JKL was going to buy but its sony DRM cd with rootkit. once sony take it off will buy itThis product installs a rootkit/malware that opens a whole can of security vulnerabilities. It modifies your drivers and makes it possible for viruses to hide themselves from your anti-virus solution. It is nearly impossible to remove. It also severly infringes on your fair usage rights by not letting you backup your songs how you want or put them on your iPod.For technical details on this rootkit, go to this site:http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.htm"
3,Sony Baloney,"I will buy this if and when Sony Baloney MF's will put it out as a regular CD and will then write a decent review then.Untill Sony, you can blo me."
2,Just Itching to Hear This,"I've always been a big fan of Neil Diamond. I look forward to his renewed career.Unfortunately, until this CD is re-released in a safe format, I won't be purchasing it. More generally, I won't be purchasing further Sony product because of the disregard that the company shows for its customers. Unless this album comes out soon without the dangerous software, I'll look for it on iTunes and will write a followup review."
1,Do not purchase music from Sony Music,"Sony Music recently attempted to ""copy protect"" their cd's. If you attempt to place them on your computer it will create significant problems with your computer by installing Malware and comprimising security. It is recommended that you do not purchase this or any Sony Music CDs for the safety of your computer system."
5,Neil Diamond at his best,"This is the Neil Diamond that I love. I've appreciated his work since the '60s when I first heard Shilo. I've followed his work ever since and purchased virtually all of his albums. ""12 Songs"" ranks among the best.The songs come from the thoughtful, reflective Diamond of his best work in ""Moods,"" ""Tap Root Manuscript"" ""Beautiful Noise"" and ""Serenade.""I think most Neil Diamond fans were disappointed by his Burt Bacharach collabration days and the years since when he just churned out trite love songs that culminated in the dreadful, unlistenable ""Three Chord Opera."" (The only exception was ""Tennessee Moon"" which was a terrific album.)But now Neil, the singer/songwriter, is back -- and we hope he stays. This is good stuff -- every track.Fortunately, I purchased it through iTunes and so bypassed the SONY malware. I can listen to it on my iPod and burned a CD version, too. The bonus tracks are excellent as well."
1,Just not right...,The DRM on this will prevent you from using it on IPOD. Don't buy this disk. This is outright anti-user and really doesn't prevent true pirates from copying the disk. Worse yet it may crash your system or let a virus in. Sony why do you hate and distrust your customers so much to do this????Too bad since this looks like possible one of the more interesting discs this year.
1,Just Say No to DRM,"Do not buy this album if you are planning on putting it into a PC so that you can use it with your iPod. This CD will install invasive software that does damage to your CD-ROM and DVD drivers, and hides itself from the operating system. Let Sony know how you feel about them damaging your operating system by not buying this CD."
2,"Music is good,copy guard very bad.i believe this stuff is in movies,and may be on other record and movie lables.",Attn to all concerned the news may be out soon when the dust clears...copy protection has been placed on other brands of cd and movies out there...The bad sound you may hear on some cd s The fuzzy or skipping video you play is spun from the same idea...to stop copying of music and movies period...Everything else has been said by others in the know...Your computer may be infected for playing a movie or cd two years ago...More research and patches are needed by yesterday...
1,I like Neil Diamond; I do not like spyware,"I love Neil Diamond, and I have all his albums. All of them except for this one (I did listen to it at a friend's house, though). Why? It's copy-protected, and it's loaded with a device call Rootkit, a form of spyware that cripples and hijacks your computer. When I did a scan on my PC last night, it identified Rootkit as a TROJAN. This terrified me. Every day, I fear for my online safety because Sony wants to make life extremely difficult for innocent consumers. We have the the right to rip and burn legitimate copies of our CDs; face it-- copying music is as old as time itself. But I will never be BULLIED into buying a copy-protected CD. And that's too bad because I love Neil Diamond."
3,Plan to buy as soon as it is without a rootkit.,Heard him on a couple of talk shows and plan to buy the CD once it's available without a root kit.
5,Stellar album!,"This is the first review I ever wrote here. This album made me do it, totally worth it. Great songs and Neil Diamond never sounded better!"
5,Not being a Neil Damond Fan but,"This collection of songs is simply chillingly beautiful. I found it incredibly moving, up lifting and heartfelt. I imagine I am supposed to write more but more words are not needed, from the first chords of 'OH MARY' just sit in a familar chair with a drink and enjoy."
4,new fan,"I'm a brand new fan of Ryan Star. I had never even heard of Ryan until a few days before seeing him open for David Cook. His performance blew me away! This album shows what an amazing voice Ryan has. Some of the songs are a little depressing at times but I find that I want to listen to this CD over and over again. Really looking forward to the release of his next album, ""11:59""!"
