4,Take a chance on the program,"I think this program is worth seeing. I bought it on a whim, never having seen it before. I just know that Showtime puts out some great drama series, like ""Queer as Folk"" and ""Soul Food"", so I knew Resurrection Blvd. would be good too. And it was.I like the authenticity of the show. The characters are compelling and you develop a relationship with them as you watch the series. The program is in English, and although some Spanish is spoken, it is always translated in the conversation of the actors, or easy to understand from the context of the specific scene.The writers demonstrate the importance of family in Mexican householdsm as well as the machismo. I really feel for Yolanda, who works all day in a stressful job as a paralegal, only to come home and cook for 5 men, ""none of whom can even boil water"" as Aunt Bibi says!It's unfortunate that the writers only includes Caucasian characters to antagonize the Mexican family. Aside from that, its a wonderful show."
2,"Not really ""giving it away""...","Well when I first bought the book, I expected to find out the reasons WHY the songs were written rather than the ""intense bass lines"".. The title is very misleading and was not was I was anticipating...P.S.- I did enjoy the pictures even though some of the captions were wrong"
2,if only it worked,"During the short time in which this laptop actually functioned normally, it worked very well - beautiful screen, decent speed. After about a day or so, I experienced hardware problems and it continually restarted on its own. (I reinstalled the OS so it was NOT a virus causing the problem). VERY frustrating."
5,The Perfect Book for Any Ancient Coin Collector- 5 Stars!,"This Hardcover Book Is Perfect in Size and Content, It Is the ""Must Have Book for any Ancient Coin Collector who wants to Learn just about Ancient Periods with Pictures! GREAT BOOK"
5,Great piano playing.,"I love Schumann's piano repertoire, especially his piano sonatas. Cortot's playing here is wonderful. But, I might be prejudiced since my mother was a student of his."
1,Poor product - poor documentation,"This is not a very good product. I never got it to work on my Mac, although drivers for Mac OS X 10.4 were supplied. The documentation was incomplete, and written in broken English. I subsequently bought a NetGear USB Wireless adapter and it works flawlessly, with no installation issues. I recommend NetGear for Mac OS X instead."
4,Nothing wrong with this but...,This works the way it should. Great.Why the but? When I searched my criteria included 3 conductor. This 2 conductor version was in the search - despite not being 3 conductor. I must be more careful in future - it happened once before with memory. So I have no real use for them - the cost of returning them would have been more than the value of the item. Shame on Amazon for returning items within a search that do not match the criteria.
1,WHITE!!!,"Like everyone else...mine were white also. Dishonest, creepy marketing? I do know that red pigment is the most expensive so Amazon probably got a deal and their customers get a white elephant sale so they can unload them. After many years of absolute trust!...this puts Amazon in a new light. This has gone on so long (we all trusted them to take care of it...right? It's why we ordered anyway...even after all the other complaints)now it's nothing less than a lie...and this review is not spiteful it is truthful. THERE IS NO RED!!!(I know you won't post this...but I'll bet all the others you fooled would cheer!)"
2,shoudl have read the description better,it wasn't a spray and you can barely shake the perfume outdisappointing....but I keep it in my travel bag for when I leave home
1,Extremely racist,Talk about taking a stereotype to the extreme! And someone please tell Anthony Anderson he cannot act is even less funny. Go away please.
4,Don't Roll Your Eyes Just Yet : ),"Ok, I must admit, this definitely isn't a brain teaser and it's not even anything you remotely have to think about to get.I bought this DVD for my son along with a few others that he wanted for his birthday and I couldn't believe I was actually cracking up laughing at this movie. It's very funny! It's one of those movies you roll your eyes at and only watch because your child wants you to watch with them and then you find yourself starting to enjoy it yourself and you look at each other and laugh.This movie is a lot of fun and has great comedic value. You might even catch yourself sayin' Wazzzup...after it's over. lol I'm glad it was a movie my family could share and one we all could enjoy."
3,Interesting,"The movie have some good actors in it, and they were funny at times, but I think that they over acted in this movie. It was as if they were trying too hard to look funny."
4,Nimitz and his admirals,"Excellent detailed review of WW II in the Pacific with all the personalities and ""backstabbing"" of the commanders that went on.Much of the details were not released to the media at the time. Many of the leaders mentioned went on to become the Chief of Naval Operations later on. I had the privelege of calling on Nimitz and his wife in 1963 and he related the story of his ship grounding detailled in the book. This book was ""released"" in 1970. Why is it so late (2000) in being published? Would loved to have read it before meeting Nimitz and his son.Could have used more maps of some of the places being discussed."
4,This book is an excellent tool for psychedelic explorations.,"I found this book to be an excellent guide to conciousnessexpanding activities. The Tibetan Bardo Thodol is wellrepresented. The passages are valuable guides to the manyblissful and terrifying realities experienced under theinfluence of LSD. I feel more time could have been devotedto the pharmaceutical subtleties incurred with use.Specifically, manufacturing processes and their inherentstrengths and weaknesses. Overall this manual rules!"
2,Ick!,"Not worth the money. This tea sounded delicious, but has very little taste, and what taste there is isn't to my taste."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Save yourself the money and the hassle of purchasing this product. The picture/screen quality it a -0. Your pictures will be clear as a bell on your camera or PC and then blurry, choppy and un recognizable on the picture frame screen. Buy with caution."
2,Disappointed,"Got to say that I thought that this would make a great mothers day gift and I could not have been more wrong. After buying the frame I then had an out lay of cash for a memory chip and then to put the pictures from my computer on that chip I then had to buy a read/write USB to transfer the file to it. So, that came to an addition out lay of $60. The picture quality is poor in that you can see the little squares that make up the picture, very grainy. Other then that there is nothing wrong with it, you get what you pay for."
1,Dismal image quality.. save your $$$,"I was hoping this would make a great gift for my mother and mother-in-law, but the image quality was so rough (i tried big files, small files, tiny files, huge files) that I would have been embarrassed to give them. I sent them back and had high quality digital prints made instead."
2,Digital picture frame,The picture area on this frame is just too small. Its about the equivalent of a 3x5 photo and the screen quality is mediocre. I returned it and got a larger size screen.
4,"It's a good product, buy it with confidence.","Hi all,i got this today, and i was impressed with the true wooden frames that came with it (black + cherry wood), after connecting it and inserting a CF disk, it started automaticly viewing my family photos at once!!!!the only thig that aanoied me is a 2 black strips at the sides of the picture, then i found a wep siter for the mother company ([...]the only problem that i faced and that was why i scored it4 stares not 5, that the power plug in the frame is disconnecting if it moved, i think the plug is little lose.a nice touch from the company that they supplied a universal power adapter 100-240 volts, as i live outside USA."
3,Dee Dee on tour,"This is Dee Dee Ramone's journal of his European tour in support of hisGreatest & Latestalbum. It's fairly interesting, but a lot of the things he talks about probably didn't really happen. I'm fairly certain he and his band mates didn't really murder a group of border patrol guards (at least I hope not). And there are some other incidents that are a bit hard to believe. But it still makes for an interesting read, even if you can't tell what is real and what isn't. Dee Dee's fans should enjoy this book.Thank you, Dee Dee, you're very wonderful."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Beautiful design but a) they should tell you upfront that the dinner plates are bigger than a standard size cupboard will hold and b) that they chip every time you even blink at them, and c) they absorb microwave heat like mad so that even a quick nuke means you need a cup holder. I feel very hoodwinked. And now we have to figure out how to pack up and return 12 big plates, 12 little plates, 12 cups and 12 bowls. Oy ve!"
1,Horrible from Pfaltzgraff,"I was so excited to get a new set of pfaltzgraff at our 11 year anniversary. Being that we had pfaltzgraff since our wedding day I was completely sold on the quality. Big mistake. Sedona are awful and I'm surprised that pfaltzgraff is standing by this product. They are too big for cabinets, don't fit in the dishwasher, they are awful in the microwave (despite the microwave safe listing) and the worst part is they chip all the time with normal use! What a waste, we spent a fortune on the huge set (because we have a large family) and I'm sick to my stomach on the waste. Don't buy this product, not only will you be thrwoing out chipped pieces daily, your food will be cold while your plate is on fire straight from the microwave AND you won't be able to store them in standard cabinets to boot."
2,"Nice looking, poorly made","The first time I received the watch, it was dead on arrival. Amazon made the return process very easy and with a Prime membership, I had a replacement in two days. The second watch lasted 4 days. This is a handsome watch and at less than fifty dollars, I was hoping it would be a real bargain. Unfortunately, you get less than what you pay for."
3,face broke soon after buying,Husband dropped it on floor and the face is now cracked. Online info said it was not worth it to have it replaced. Looked good and worked to that point.
4,really solid,i really like this lil thing! it is well made and very useful for a lot of applications! hi lift are making great kit these days just seem to be really over priced........
1,feeble and useless,This book is pretty much useless. Not many techniques and they don't seem very likely to work. alot of things that assume the guy you are fighting is just going to stand there with his arm stretched out after he has tried to punch you. this is definately the worst hapkido book out there.
4,Give one to a person to develop more Prayer in their Life,"This book is very dynamic. We present as a gift to our guest speakers or to those in need of more Prayer Life. It is a very enjoyable book and we try to share this information with as many people as possible. Very simple but profound.Should be a required read for anyone in ministry, going to theological seminary, or just plan want to know more."
5,A Bass Enthusiast from NV,"This Bass CD has a lot of Good clear Bass that can be heard from a long distance. It also has The bass that turns heads Fast slow and funky, like Revenge of the Pink Boom it is a Remix in bass of the cartoon Pink Panther theme. If you have a nice system in your car or house that can handle some hard hitting bass I would definitely recommend this title."
3,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this game, but the controls are awkward, such as lining up and aiming before you get shot!! It seems the DS is more suited to role playng and puzzle games"
5,Excellent product!,This product has saved two of our trees....a Honey Locust sprang back to life and an ailing Mondale Pine showed new growth and greener needles. The product is easy to use with concise instuctions.
2,Buy it only if you can't get something better.,"Despite the English subtitle, and the description as a 2 volume set, this is a single volume, possibly abridged (the notes to the index refer to over 500 pages, but there are < 400), French only reprint in a cheap & shoddy binding. No English summary or notes.My copy arrived with the spine partly ripped off, even though correctly packed & there was no damage to the packing - I'm unable to tell whether it was shipped to Amazon like this. The binding is similar to, but poorer than, cheap 'text book' hardcover binding.Get a Dover edition if available."
5,Loved by 2 and 42 year olds alike,"Our family loves this album just as much as the previous Justin Roberts titles. My 2 year old son requests ""Justin Roberts"" whenever he get in the car, and I am always happy to oblige. My 5 year old takes pride in learning all the words to her favorite songs. (Currently Brontosaurus..., Billy the Bully, and Not Naptime.) Like his others, there are slower songs on Not Naptime that we usually skip by because we can't wait for the catchy ones. Justin keeps up his average of 4-5 mega kid hits per album with Not Naptime."
1,Disappointing,"There is plenty that needs to be discussed about America and its role in the world. It is a topic that needs someone with intelligence and courage. And Gore Vidal is a person who clearly could contribute significantly on all this. He could (and does) tell us about our botched process of voting for President. And he could (and does) tell us what he thinks about America's imperial tendencies.Unfortunately, Vidal is unreliable and untrustworthy. On the topic of Arab aggression against Israel, Vidal says that in America, ""Arabs are characterized as sub-human terrorists. Israel may not be criticized at all."" That's not true. And he says that the Israeli lobby has ""extorted"" more money from the U. S. treasury for its holy land than any other minority. That seriously mischaracterizes the conflict, as well as America's role in it. These are not mere careless errors.I do not recommend this book."
5,One bottle and you'll notice a difference!,Bottom line...it works! I reset my odometer at every fill up and have been adding a bottle once a month and I have now increased my mileage by over 20 miles a tank. I drive many highway miles so tracking this is pretty easy. I also notice a smoother engine after before the first 1/8 tank is used. Once that tank is gone a I go back to regular gas I can tell the smooth feeling and pep is gone.
5,Great stuff!,I have used this product for several years with excellent results. I drive a 2000 Toyota 4Runner V-6 and have over 160K miles. I use Lucas Fuel treatment 3-4 times per year (1500 -2000 miles) and have had no injector problems to date. My last mileage check was 20mpg city driving. I purchased this vehicle new and it runs as well now as the day I brought it home.
1,The cover is the best thing about this book.,"The games are too complicated and not very much fun. Buy a couple of water guns and teach children the lines, shots, and make them run and the kids would like it so much more. Not a good choice for individual lessons."
1,Junk,I returned it after one day. It sucked up batteries superfast. At one point it killed my visor requiring a hard re-boot. I lost everything installed and had to start again.Major trouble finding a signal unless I was out in an open parking lot.I am waiting for the Magellan GPS for visor with the 10 hour battery life and external power source and optional car bracket
1,NEXIAN Handy GPS:How are we to guess?,The editorial review is anything but a cut and paste of the product features i.e. the reviewer sure didn't try it. We then move to the five individual reviews which are contradictory. Some say it doesn't work at all and others say it works fine. Are the later working for the company or the former for the competition?
5,Remarkable,"The Handygps is fun and worth the money. I purchased one after the Comdex show. It has proven to work every time. It acquires satellites in about 3 minutes. I found it really amazing when I drove into my driveway and it knew exacty where I was. This GPS does indeed work and it is not nearly as expensive as some of the other GPS products on the market. In fact, I'm back here at Amazon to buy one for a buddy of mine for his b-day. I recommend it. Buy it and have fun!"
5,I love my HandyGPS,I can't imagine why there have been people that have not enjoyed this GPS module. I have traveled in Salem OR and Seattle WA and have been ecstatic at how cool this GPS is. I highly recommend the HandyGPS for the functionality and the price.
5,"great music, great stories, great CD","I first heard Jonathan Byrd at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 2003. Jonathan was one of the New Folk winners that year. I go to Kerrville every year and meet tons of singer/songwriters. I buy a lot of CD's to help support their efforts, but almost always, I am left feeling like the CD is merely a reminder of the face to face experience. This CD is an exception. By owning it, I was given the chance to really listen closely to each song, study the music, the skilled playing, the rich narrative story telling, the clever lyrics. This is an exceptional CD by an extraordinary singer/songwriter."
4,pretty good speakers,"I think the speakers are pretty good, within the limitations. As with other reviewers, there should be more bass. Maybe that would make the whole unit bigger and more expensive, but being a little picky, more bass. And a bigger carrying case. The case itself is a great idea, but why not have room for everything to fit comfortably? All in all, sound quality is pretty good, the battery lasts a good long time (even in the cold it'll last more than 5 hours) and I love the look of the unit."
2,"Shrieky highs, no lows...","I wanted to like it. It's a speaker system that is the size and shape of a thermos. Unfortunately the sound quality is mediocre to say the least. High frequencies are shrieky (as if they're getting cut off into a square wave), and there's practically no output below 100hz (it really is that bad). They're kinda loud for the size, so if that rocks your boat, then they're good. I guess they'd be ok for a micro PA system (but really you could yell louder). Anyway, eventually I settled for a Creative T20 speakers, and for portable use, I have a small lead battery and t20's sounds a lot better, bassier, and louder than those. Long story short, this is a good idea in terms of portability and looks, but just not executed well enough for me in terms of sound quality."
2,Don't Bother,"Probably got the best price of the year and it came right on time. However, if you can just wear a 7.5 inch tennis bracelet, you probably won't be able to wear this watch. Sent it off for additional links; 31 days and $40 later got it back. No indication that the bracelet shop is internet savy or has any sense of urgency. The band's only adjustment is adding or removing links. Now we need to get links removed so it will fit."
4,Gift Item,"My Brother was very happy with his gift. It fit great and looks great. It was a little thinner material than I thought, but still good."
2,Color not as described,"Ordered this based on the picture that (to me at least) appeared to be a maroon color. The image was not at all true-to-life of the actual color. The actual top was much more red than pictured. The quality of the garment was as expected of Under Armour. Would have kept it and loved it had the color been accurate, as it was I returned it which was quick and easy."
2,not as advertised,Read this device would add another 2 hours to the run time of my laptop.My laptop draws 22 watts (per kill-a-watt meter) and the mobile 100 lastsbetween 45 and 60 minutes before it shuts down. I was not expecting2 hours but I did expect at least 90 mins. The Mypower All 3400 or apc'suniversal laptop battery are better choices if running a laptop is yourmain use.
3,you get what you pay for,"I expected this balance to be more exact. I didn't buy things just to use in this because I thought it'd be more fun to use things from around the house. However, 2 crackers vs. 1 cracker balanced out even. I wish I'd spent more on higher quality."
4,"As promised, appealing for little kids","Well, my daughter (7) loved it and listened to it on car trips for several weeks. The arrangements are fine if a bit repetitive to an adult ear. It is in Mandarin (which she does not speak at all, though she has a rudimentary knowledge of Cantonese)."
2,You Don't Want to Sing These Songs To Your Little Ones,"We have three children and are in the process of having our fourth... mandarine is something we are beginning to learn so i purchased this cd for them to listen to... Yuck! I love Chinese music, but the messages in some of these songs is not sweet nor encouraging in family. Songs of cheating lovers and unhappy marriages... not for us... very sorry i bought this :-( i will look for some others to replace this one and in the trash it goes!"
3,Adequate but full or errors,"Like many other reviewers, I purchased this book alongside the MS Press 70-536 Training Kit. This book really can only be useful for an experienced C# developer who is looking to fill in any knowledge gaps concerning the language itself. Such a person would be able to spot the numerous errors and move past them without harm done. However, I could not, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone actually seeking to learn the language.As an example, on page 21, the unary operators are described with examples for each. However, the postfix increment ""++"" and postfix decrement ""--"" operators have their examples swapped. Once again, someone already in the know wouldn't be too bothered by this and would figure it out immediately, but for others, it could result in quite a bit of confusion."
5,Excellent: all examples drawn from rock music,"In contrast to some instructional books, all these examples are drawn from actual songs--Led Zeppelin, Police, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Hendrix, Grand Funk Railroad, Greenday, to name a few. They are well notated and accurately played on the accompanying CD. I buy lots of guitar books, and this book is one of my favorites. You don't just learn progressions, but also lot many rhythm riffs from actual songs, which expands your rhythm vocabulary. With some books, it's a chore to finish them. With this book, I played through all the examples from cover to cover. Highly recommended."
3,Offensive double-dip,"Due respect to Adam Sandler and SNL, who should have plenty of funny material available for a ""best of Sandler volume two"" through ""volume ten,"" but this DVD is a flagrant double-dip situation. A lot of fans have already paid for this collection once... it's the same core program... and the ""20 minutes of NEW Special Features"" are neither truly new nor worth the repeat purchase. So two stars for the package.As for the actual program itself the ""best of"" moniker translates more to ""most well known"" rather than genuinely his best stuff. Still all classic Sandler though-- four stars.So it averages out to three stars. SNL is sitting on a huge pile of hilarious Sandler stuff... same with Chris Farley, Eddie Murphy, Will Farrell, and John Belushi, all of whom are also getting re-releases this fall... why do they keep showing us the same 90 minutes of material over and over again?"
1,"I rate it as no ""introduction"" to English grammar. Being referred to 15 pages before a current page is ridiculous.","I did well in English, and graduated from N. Texas State University in 1981 (now Univ of N. Tx); however, my wife, a born & bred Chinese from Beijing, at 50, has only 11 years of actual English usage--composition and conversational. She received an ""A.S."" degree from Richland Community College in 2011, and is presently a senior at U. of Tx at Dallas where graduation with a business degree in marketing is expected in the summer of 2013. Both of us agree that the text is written in a much more ""advanced"" manner, than what we expected from an introductory book."
3,"Third Grade Reviewers @ The Potomac School, McLean, VA","Girls enjoyed this story of a well-prepared princess who outsmarts her obnoxious brothers. Boys, on the other hand, found this tale of the strong and steadfast younger sibling ""too unrealistic."" All liked the watercolor illustrations inspired by a tapestry, but disliked the abrupt ending, and would have preferred details of the princess' ""year and a day"" away from court. Student reviewers recommend this title for reading aloud to kindergarten and first grade listeners, and reading alone for grades two and three."
4,even the boys like this one,"I read to K and 1st graders as a volunteer; this book is one of the most popular among both boys and girls and I don't get tired of reading it to them. This princess (not a Disney kind of princess) is raised learning the skills of knights, but she does so in her own way. The emphasis is on her cleverness and not beauty. The kids I've read it to always have an expression of great satisfaction on their faces when we finish it!"
5,Roger Rocks!,"Roger Creager is an unbelievably taltented singer/songwriter. He's already HUGE in Texas. Eventually he's gonna rock the rest of the world. If you haven't heard any of his music, then you're seriously missing out. Roger writes the best songs. He will make you laugh, cry, and/or sing-along to every song. You can hear the passion in his voice. And you can really tell that his words are straight from the heart. Give him a listen. You will NOT be dissapointed. Roger Creager is one of the best musicians out there."
5,unique book,"This is an important walk through traditional Korean song and dance. I am so glad that this book has been compiled to preserve the history and background of these cultural treasures. I don't know of any other book that combines all this information on Korean music like Pansori (Narrative Solo Singing), Daechwita (Traditional Military Music), Hyangje Julpungnyu (Buddhist Ceremonial Music). Music from the different regions like Jeju Island, Northwest Region Gyeonggi Region are discussed too. There's also the Dance of Peace, the Crane and Lotus Flower Dance, the Monk dance and even Taekgyuen (Traditional Martial Art). I've seen some of these dances and songs performed, but knowing the history behind it makes the experience so much richer. Very interesting. Very unique."
2,Warning Not a complete guide!!,"This book starts with a contradictory disclaimer that says essentially:""We do but we dont, we will but we wont, we have but we havent etc..."" This book contains a sampling of artists, not all artists. It claims some International content but I have yet to find it. Its only redeeming quality is the excellent label references and pictures that can date your records to the year (this too is incomplete though). I bought the book simply to confirm the date and artists other titles(basic collector info). This book is useless for that purpose unless you share the specific tastes of the author."
1,Never ending problems,"This TV is a piece of junk. My in-laws bought one and have had nothing but trouble with it. First it was the blank screen issue (mentioned in another review), now its the remote issue ( [...]). All of these seem like very common problems from searching the net. All in all it seems like this TV is just poorly built."
1,Damaged,"Product not what was suppsde to be pages are falling out cover a mess. And it is not an american dictionary, can not find a lot of ordinary words. bought for someone in need of a dictionary not worth it all. will never order from this company again."
1,NOT LARGE PRINT!,"Although this book purports to be LARGE PRINT, it isn't which was very disappointing. It is small though. I also ordered the Webster's New World large Print Dictionary which is excellent though larger."
3,Expected More,When I saw Mom & Tot I expected more. I think I thought I would get more things that I could use my toddler for and that it would be fun for the toddler. My toddler was less than interested and there really wasn't much I could do with my toddler.
3,Easy to get back into working out.,"My daughter 21 months, didn't want to dance along. It is very outdated though. It was good to start and workout again though."
4,Interesting...,"Very provocative!! I loved the characters but I think the world needs to be a bit more original... The adventure the characters embarked upon were interesting as well. The main character needed to develop a better personality, although some of the situations were very humorous. As far as being a Dragonlance book, it didn't match up, but different authors can change a novel drastically. I did like the cover design, though!"
5,Fantastic Novel,This is a fantastic novel in many senses of the word. Powerfully written and in the tradition of both Jewish fabulist fiction and contemporary magic realism. Centered on women's lives of about 100 years ago but relevant to both our practical and spiritual lives today. And you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy and treasure it!
3,This novel will appeal to many readers.,"Lilian Nattel is a good story teller, and she brings to life Jewish London in the 19th century. Why didn't I like this novel more? In ""Singing Fire"", I never could get involved because I felt the characters and their stories were there to illustrate the times, and to make an appealing novel, while never taking on a life of their own. As a better written novel, I would point out ""Women of the Silk"" by Gail Tsukiyama, also about women working under very poor conditions, in pre-WWII China."
5,"Delicious, humorous, nice yarn","Unlike many other reviewers I liked this book immensely. I doubt that many of us have eaten at many (or any) of these gourmet palaces described in the book, but we can still dream. I enjoyed the whole setup - the decision to go, the pair that traveled, the 65 Mustang, the sheer gall of the adventure...but most of all, the food.The descriptions of both the land, the people, the buildings and all the internal machinations of running and thriving in the ruthless business were enlightening and enjoyable. Especially good were the many conversations with the various chef-owners and their differing philosophies. Some of the places are no longer in business - so what? At least they once were and they served food on the order not found in America. Did I consider the author opinionated? Sure, that's why I bought the book. I wanted to hear from someone NOT paid to hype these places.If I go to Europe I plan to take this book and try out some of these places. Buy the book."
5,Excellent video on sculpting the human head,"Mr Alfrey's dvd was excellent. It contained enough detail to help a sculptor improve sculpture abilities regardless of the experience level. I would recommend it for the beginner, intermediate, or advanced sculptor.I wish I had bought this sooner, it would have helped me learn faster."
1,"""I have to pee.""","I am extremely disappointed.The message is heavy handed, the tank and its crew are unconvincing and the dialogue amounts to little more than, ""I have to pee"".If you are looking for an intelligent war film you won't find it here.If you are looking for an action packed war movie, you won't find it here."
2,Not An Enjoyable Movie Experience,"Not an enjoyable movie experience. It deals with an important topic, however, the movie was very dark and depressing, and it was a little confusing exactly what was happening. While there may have been a reason for it being made this way, in the end, it did not leave the audience with anything useful to think about, just a depressing feeling."
2,Workout Review,"I found the workout much too short....not much fun to do. I'm back to my old pilates CD....which I feel gives you a much better workout and really concentrates on your breathing and working your abs and waist. I'm a fan of Dr. Oz, so I though if he recommends this workout that it must be good, however, I was really disappointed."
2,Can't get past the style,"If there's good information in here, I never got to it. I could not get past the too-cute style, with its bad puns and attempts to be funny in just about every sentence. Just to painful to stick with."
5,Just What I Was looking For,"I have managed to squeeze this workout into my daily routine and have lost 4 pounds. Best of all, I feel less stressed and ready to start everyday."
3,You On A Diet Work Out Video,I thought it was interesting. It was very straight and to the point video. I enjoyed it.
1,You on a diet,I ordered this DVD and it had some kind of glue on the surface. Of course it won't play and the fine print says that you cannot return an opened DVD. I'll never order from this source again!
5,Everyone Loves Chuck.,"this is a great show, that ran its course and ended on a high note. Needed this season to complete my series."
4,"Combination of humor, action, romance, and fun","Chuck's Third Season, brings the story of Charles Bartowski to a personal level. We see the love of family, the importance of friendship, and the need to share the truth. Laughs and tears are involved in this season unlike the other two."
5,Best TV Show Ever!!,"I have been a huge fan of this show since it first aired!! Absolutely love Chuck!! It's so witty, quirky, smart, action-packed and funny! The cast are the perfect choice and they just do an amazing job. And it just gets better and better every season! This season is amazing, but season 4 just goes even further and after seeing the season finale to season 4-I CAN'T WAIT for season 5!!! Seriously, if you're not watching this show, you're missing out!! Love it!"
3,unicorn too many crooks,this cd is just o.k. bullseye bill is the best song on it .no way out of here is good too. this band was rock band but could also do slow songs too. no way out of here is a slow song and it is good. the vocals are good and lyrics are good. i have not heard of any other songs on this cd. and i really did not care for the others. bullseye bill is a good song. more rock with a little country influence on it.
2,Good to throw.,It is easy to throw but my year old pup pulled the handle out of 2 of them in 1 day. Tha third one has lasted well.
1,Poor return policy,"I purchased 4 Leviton switchs with lighted, clear toggle. What I received from Ace Hardware Outlet was a different product. The shipped product was White toggle with lighted frame. I contacted the supplier regarding the error. I pointed to the ""picture"" and description in Amazon. They agreed theirs was different but indicated that I can't use the picture on Amazon as a guide. They would only refund the shipping costs if I kept the wrong switches. Otherwise, in order to return the ""wrong"" product, I had to pay shipping back to them."
5,Adobe what?,"I always swore by Adobe Photoshop. Until I lost it, and it was outdated anyway... So, fine, I 'll try this one. Took some getting use to since I was so conditioned to using Adobe. But its fantastic!! I can't imagine needing a new ""upgraded"" version of this one ever. It has everything I need, and everything I needed and didn't know it (hahah). Loads of fun, always turns out lovely (or grungy on purpose in some cases!). The price was unbelievable that I ended up buying one for a friend too. And now she uses it for her virtual store advertisments. It's great!"
5,A Hell of a Lot of Fun,"If I were looking for a professional cocktail ""bible"" I'd do some research ahead of time to make sure that what I got was the bartender's equivalent of a scholarly work. The fact that Drinkology: The Art and Science of the Cocktail was issued by a publisher of art books should give the browser a clue that it's not intended as an encyclopedia but as the subjective views of the author about mixed drinks--the ART of the cocktail. Get it?I won't quibble with the criticisms of some of the other reviewers because they just aren't relevant. I don't like to be personal, but do any of those critics have a sense of humor?The book is just a pleasure to read, chock-a-block with lucid, witty descriptions and opinions. The writing is so good that you don't have to be fond of drinking to enjoy it--but I may be going too far, and the author might strenuously--though with astringent humor--disagree."
1,Unless you are an instuctor - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Pearson or Prentice Hall does not want the self taught to have access to the sample code for this book. Their comment ""If we are able to verify your employment as a college instructor, you will receive an access code via email."" Without the source code the book is a total waste of money. Even if you buy it used at a reduced price. Be warned!"
1,"Out of date book, crappy publisher","OK, first, I got this for a college class. In class, I learned how to use the scanner object, this book doesn't teach that, instead they teach a very slow and clunky way of making your own. Similar flaws occur all over the book, I'm not sure if it was written before 1.6 Java and the author was just too lazy to update it, or if the author just didn't know about all the classes available with Java.Then we get to the book quality-or lack of. I have two pages that fell out, and a black mark on just about every page from ink getting on a roller. Granted, the extra black triangles are mostly small enough to read around, but in a textbook that you paid $100 for, this kind of quality is unacceptable.If you are a professor, please pick a better book, heck, there is a free book that is better than this!"
2,I wanted to learn JAVA,"While the title of this book promises to teach Java, instead it mostly teaches the reader how to use specialzed bits of code that the author wrote himself. The reason I bought the book was to learn JAVA, so I could write my own code. I suppose this book would be good for people who want to be able to write Java programs without learning Java."
3,not so good,Bought these for my boyfriend for XMAs- also bought the VIBES by V Moda and we liked them much better. I returned this one.
2,Was Einstein wrong?,"The author reports on an experiment evincing anomalous behavior of coherent (laser) light. The setup is simple enough to reproduce, however the author's hypotheses run counter to current theories of physics. It is posited that photons are massless, which would require an alternate explanation for the photoelectric effect (it is the momentum of a photon that knocks electrons lose), and that photons upon leaving their source do not share the velocity of the issuing frame, in contravention of the Special Theory of Relativity."
5,"Fits fine, good value","Length:: 0:26 MinsOthers have complained that the skin did not fit. Maybe they were sent the wrong item. What I was sent fits great. As a plus they did not charge a shipping fee. Given the other comments, I felt it necessary to make a video. Sorry about the lighting. Skin fits. Skin does not interfere with function of camera in any way. You must remove or peal back the skin to open the ports. I would buy again from the vendor."

1,Chips easily!!!,Chips easily with normal use. Poor quality....Started chipping within a week of purchase.... This purchase was a Big mistake...Buyer Beware!!!
2,Das Efx,"Being a big fan of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4 albums this does not hold up to levels that the past offered. Das Efx did this one for the fans, not for the critics. I dont think this CD will sell at all, unless your a die hard fan. With main stream Rap taking over, the audience for this selection fell off after das's first two CD's."
5,Beyond Description,This is the best music I have ever listened to! A combination of classical meters with a boogie woogie backbeat! Nothing like it since Joe Simon's field recordings of the Hibernian skink trappers playing their harpoons!
1,"Flimsy, Sparse, and Fake-looking","I purchased 2 of the corless lighted poinsettia garland and was greatly dissappointed. I loved the fact that it was battery powered and it was one less cord to worry about this holiday season; however, I now need to order additional garland to try and make this poinsettia garland use-able. The flowers are small, flimsy, and look cheap - especially since there is lots of space between each flower. So alone, the item just looks sad. Hopefully, I'll be able to wrap the poinsettia flowers around some pine garland or something to make it look more elegant. If that doesn't work, I'll be going through the hassle and returning these."
3,Red Cordless Poinsettia Garland,"My order arrived quickly and I was very excited to use them to decorate the top of our piano, however, the LED lights on our red garland are red. I did not realize that, and they looked white in the picture. I did not see anything stating that the lights would be red. It's okay, but not quite what I was going for (I have white lights everywhere else). As far as the flowers go, the are as realistic as I would expect for fake poinsettias with a light coming of out the middle. :) I think if I had expected the red lights I would not have been so disappointed. I ended up adding some real pine branches behind the garland and it looks very pretty."
3,"This was a surprise, and not in the good way.....","I was very surprised to see these when I opened the tiny plastic bag they were in. They're individual little flowers, all strung together with tiny wires. I thought it would look more like normal garland. The photo is probably the most deceiving on the internet, and that's saying a lot. About the time I was deciding to package them up and send them back, I decided to plug in the batteries and give them a try. Oddly enough, without all the greenery of normal garland, I was able to arrange the individual flowers on the mantel ""around"" decorations that were already there. The flowers sort of ""tuck"" in and around everything and stretch the length of the mantel. I waited till hubby got home to get his first reaction and low-and-behold, he like them. So we kept them after all. It would have been nice if the description and photo had been more accurate, but it's not horrible."
1,Not as pictured,"I ordered 2 of these, expecting them to look like the picture, but they certainly don't! Red lights, for one, which I don't really mind, instead of the gold. And the flowers are spaced really far apart, and were very squished from the packaging. So, to achieve a similar effect to the pictured product, I had to stagger my strands and ziptie them together into one strand... Definitely not worth $20 a string, especially when in order to get the pictured fullness you need 2 strings for $40!"
1,Terrible,"The garland is too expensive for what you actually get. It won't cover our standard mantle, I'd need to buy several of these in order to make it work, and I just don't think it's worth it. You can go to the store and get something of much better quality for the same price, if not cheaper."
1,This item sucked,"I was so excited to get this item,very disappointed.This is the first item that I've ever been disappointed with from amazon.I put two different sets of batteries in it and it still didnt light up."
4,Good,"The paper looks like it has gotten a little damp then dried, but other than that it's in good condition I'm impressed."
2,Read these reviews! I should have!,I purchased the Toshiba RD-XS34 Recorder without reading the reviews posted here. I should have! The recording quality is good but the controls are confusing and the instruction manual is not a lot of help. I found that once I figured out how to do something I was better off writing it down and creating my own instructions. Multiple overlapping controls on the remote don't help the situation. I have had the recorder for two months and I now have it almost figured out. TV Guide is as described in the reviews. A nightmare. Finally left the recorder off for three days and now have the guide but I worry it will go away again. Can't record movies off HBO or Showtime and put on DVD unless it's a DVD-RAM which won't play on most DVD players. We had hoped to record movies and play on our other DVD TV but that's not happening. Editing works OK but takes a lot of fooling around with to get comfortable with it. There has got to be better recorder than this.
4,Not as elegant as TiVo but love the price,I have some experience with the TiVo sold by DirecTV and this unit does not really compare in ease of operation. It is a bit clunky to navigate menus and its response time is slow by the TiVo standard. It does have some real advantages over the TiVo - DVD recorder and no monthly charges. Those make this a good value with one caveat. I had no trouble with the TV Guide programming function. It took about 24 hours to load and has worked exactly as advertised since. It found multiple program showings on multiple channels and using the greater resolution delivers very nice images. I don't know how you would determine if the TV Guide is going to work for you but if it does - this baby is worth the money.
2,Difficult to use,"A ""TIVO"" or ReplayTV, this isn't! I am using it with manual record only, but the manual recording interface is very clunky - really slow and frustrating navigation around the settings, and it often interprets a single key press as two presses. The menu system is labyrinthine - very inuntuitive. Also, we seem to miss recordings on the HDD that were clearly scheduled, after having cleared out plenty of space on the HDD beforehand. I can't find a way for it to tell me how much disk space is left either. Furthermore, I can't get it to only keep a certain number of a program, and throw away older recordings automatically, so tidying up the HDD storage is a regulary required chore, otherwise it doesn't record your new programs.As a general observation, I wish user manuals had an index!"
2,Not cotton,I didn't notice that the sweatshirt was a cotton/polyester blend. My husband wears only 100% cotton because the blend is too hot and does't breathe well.
1,"Really small, different item...","First off, I bought this and they gave me a blue one...Second, It's really small. I'm a small person 5'3"", and this is tight on me. I can barely put both of my hands in the pocket in front.Third, The one I got was a single layer..."
2,Low quality,"Bought for my husband, but after only several laundries it took very unattractive appearance. It was not the only hoodie of my husband, so he had not beed wearing it 24 hour a day, 7 per week:)). But for working to site it is ok. But I'll not buy it again"
2,stop riding al pacino's strap,"man every rapper and their mama think that scarface is the only gangster flick out there they should make music inspired by soundtracks like dolemite, foxy brown, coffy, superfly, shaft, hell long live the blaxcploitation era and the p funk."
1,Wrong item received returned it.,This was not what I ordered and I returned it. It had the hook and the photo I ordered did not show the hook.
4,"really really really good music, but...","this cd has a great collection of rare (at least... i think theyre rare) tracks that sound good and flow well. some nice dark, deep music to play in the background while you meditate your stresses away, although i dont think electronic music (except for maybe chill-out) is suitable for thatwhat i found to be ""defective"" (maybe its just like that) is the music quality isnt really all too high. sounds like some 96kbps mp3's on your stereo. the other GT's didnt have this problem. hmm..purchase this cd if you want the tunes. dont purcahse it if low quality disturbs/bothers you."
4,Texas Tower Sniper,Video was well done and was an interesting look at a terrible moment inAmerican History.
1,Looks good on the shelf,"If Mr. Ganssles's embedded disign skills are even slightly inversely proportional to his writing skills, then he undoubtedly is one of the true experts in the field. This book has a few small pieces of interest but the cost of getting them is a bit high. Take this book to read at the dentist's whil you are getting a root canal. You won't even notice the drill. Almost zero technical content for anybody who wants to learn how to make embedded systems. Mostly an eclectic ramble about Mr. Ganssle's view of management, engineers, software development, and life in general."
3,cute dog sign,"I have one and i love it, i don't play with it but it's good for ty beanie baby colleters."
5,This is a wonderful book,"This one is one of the best books I have read about doing psychotherapy. It also covers an area that is not addressed very often, at least in my experience. Fosha describes why tracking people's moment-to-moment emotional experience in therapy is important, and gives a number of ideas about how to track this emotional experience. The book has changed the way I do therapy and I am very glad I read it."
5,very clear,"i put these speakers in the rear pillars of my 2000 gmc crew cab daully. they are a perfect fit and the sound quality is excellent. they are not real harsh sounding, wich is good since they are mounted right next to the people in back ears. the treble is soft and natural and they dont distort. i first ran them off just a jvc head unit but liked the way they sounded so much i added a rockford fosgate punch 60 so i could turn them up louder. they not only got ALOT louder! they got even clearer. i put the rockford fosgate primes in the doors."
4,Great product.,"I needed a spray hose for my stationary tub and could not find one anywhere locally, so I decided to look on line. Great product and fast service."
3,... what were you thinking?,"While all of Paul's other works are superb (especially 'Politics of Dance'), this CD is a very deep disappoinment. Reflections is a hodge-podge of a little pop, a little rap, some ambient, and maybe some trance. Although many of the tunes are good by themselves, most of them do not mix well together, offering incongruant beat patterns and unharmonious mood switches.This CD should have been marketed to DJs only as a collection of tunes to select from, but it fails as a continuous mix because of the harsh transitions. It would appear that Paul wrote a limited amount of music and had to make sure it all made its way onto the CD - which was a big mistake. While I really like everything else Paul has released, I cringe each time I listen to this CD.Unless you feel a real need to own everything released by Paul van Dyk, I would recommend anything else he has done ahead of this sadly lacking work. ..."
4,"Great cd, are you guys crazy!!!","I'm Jared, huge fan of all music, mainly dance music. Paul van Dyk and Bt being among my favorites. I cant believe some of you are smashing Paul's album reflections the way you are. I agree, I dont like track 9 knowledge, it just doesnt fit well, it also sounds too much like ""Knowledge of Self"" from Emotional Technology by BT. With that aside, the rest is great, it just took time to get it in my mind and body to appreciate it more,usually the way great albums are. With regard to Paul going pop, I saw him in Boston in August, he is not pop, but if he becomes accepted in pop, more power to him, the way Bt has. I think more electronic artists should branch out to reach more people, open all minds. This way we wont have so much throw away rap music like nelly on our radios,do it the way they do it in europe. Bottom line: Reflections- awesome beats and heartfelt lyrics and sounds. 4 stars!!!"
4,Austin Xmas,"This is a fun Christmas collection that captures the early Austin, TX blues sound, including the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Lou Ann Barton. The mysterious Paul Ray is indeed a lounge singer; he used to front Paul Ray and the Cobras with Denny Freeman and Stevie Ray vaughn on guitars. Ray was also a great DJ on KUT with ""Twine Time,"" playing all kinds of lost R&B numbers."
4,An Impressive Civil War History,This 3 part Civil War History is authoritative and readable.Scott Gleditsch MDPsychiatrist
2,Disappointed,"I very much looked forward to reading Shelby's trilogy on the civil war. I am by no means a civil war expert, but read a lot of history. I've seen him on TV and enjoyed his comments. I'm usually a stickler for references but was prepared for his ""narrative"" approach. I have to say that he falls into the category of the historian who can't see the forest for the trees. I will say that his maps, although simple, are good- it's amazing how many historians provide useless or no maps- but there is just no context. I am surprised at all of the excellent reviews; not trying to start an argument but there is a definite art to writing history that compels and pays due diligence to the facts. Perhaps I should read more of his work but this very long work does not do that."
3,The man's life's work with crap print on the spine,"Foote's narrative is a favorite of mine. 5 stars are merited for his work however, the product is troublesome. The tacky plastic blue label on the spine will come off right on your hands. I am very glad that I still have the dust jackets because these things look ugly after one read. In years to come we will see these things on the used shelf in the bookstore looking like a half scratched off lotto ticket. You'll be lucky if you can still read the title. I bought this set expecting a bit more in the production quality. Shame on Random House for putting that crap on the spine."
3,"A great piece of hardware, but agree with all about the firmware","I've wrestled with this camera for a year, and sometimes get terrific results but am frequently stymied. Example: I migrated from a Linksys router to an Apple TimeCapsule (N router with storage) and after spending 11 hours with several Toshiba tech support people, gave up on them. I installed a Panasonic BLC20A which I borrowed from a neighbor and it worked fine, so I copied the settings with the Toshiba and bingo, I am now able to see the camera over the Internet.Email is another story though. I've tried [...] (which I knew would not work) and none of them will receive email from the camera. Again, Toshiba tech support is flummoxed.I would certainly appreciate a response by anyone who can tell me an email provider that will receive email from this thing. At one time I did have it working on [...], but not any longer. I honestly feel it is a simple setting that I am overlooking."
5,Great Pool Float!,Our family had real fun with this pool float. Very durable i would say as even adolescents took their turns to ride this. Kids were the happiest as many of them were able to enjoy this all of them together.
2,"Skip recollections, restaurant recipies passable.","As an avid amateur chef and organic food aficionado, I was drawn to this book. However, the recipe collection as a whole seems too random. The restaurant recipes Jones chose look intriguing, but seem far too sophisticated for the amateur chef for whom this book is trying to appeal to. Aside from the occasional humorous anecdote, Jones' recollections aren't funny enough to make the pedestrian recipes any more appetizing. To that point, the juvenile sketches were distracting in this otherwise beautifully designed book."
2,A bit over the top,"The House that Ate the Hamptons sparked memories of past housbuilding uproars in the tony Hamptons.....well chronicled in the newspapers' Style sections and the upscale magazines. James Brady once again mixes the famous and the veiled famous and the made up famous (how can you resist Howard Roark from The Fountainhead) mix with the real citizens of the Hamptons. Beecher Stowe VI returns and becomes embrioled in the mystery house being built by an unknown person. The house threatens to be everything the established members of all ranges of Hampton's society hate. And there are mysterious forces at work and an unexpected visit from the president. I have to be honest...I was put off by the opening ""credits"" listing everything from Beecher's clothing to Lady Alix's gold nipple ring. It seemed to smack of everything that established Hamptons residents find bad taste. Thiscould be an engaging story, but it gets bogged down in name dropping and side stories."
1,How can they sell these things and get away with it?,I bought this Greenlee GT-11 voltage detector and was very dissappointed. I probed a live outlet and got no reaction until I inserted the tip directly into the outlet ( it only sounded the alarm on one side of the outlet and not the other ). I then tapped it on my hand and the alarm sounded?!?! I have had other voltage detectors that react when placed near the electrical source...just like you would expect. The Greenlee GT-11 is just plain dangerous ...you really never know if the line is live or not.
1,Lonely Planet Hawaii,"Everyone thinks Lonely Planet has such great guidebooks. I used to feel that way, until we used one for the island of Hawaii.The directions given placed us on private property. The owners were quite upset that we had come through the gate on to their property. As a frequent tourist I do not want to upset the locals. When rereading the directions, it is as if the writer were on purpose sending people on to the property to upset the owners. I don't know, maybe they had some confrontations that the writer wanted to get back at the property owner?? Not very professional.I think Lonely Planet should be more careful about what they recieve and print from their writers. I won't buy another Lonely Planet guidebook. For Hawaii buy Hawaii Revealed, Oahu Revealed, Kauai Revealed or Maui Revealed. The best guidebooks ever for those islands."
1,remote is junk,The remote does not tell you what your setting the the heating or cooling to. What good is that. I retured it.
4,Works well with a little patience and persistence,"This item was relatively easy to install and program. However, I initially had intermittent success getting the remote to interface with the thermostat. I tried several options such as changing the frequency selector, moving the antenna to different locations and resetting the system. I was finally able to get the remote to work consistently by moving the antenna in increments of about 1/4"" from pointing straight up to pointing straight down to find the ideal ""sweet spot"" where the remote would work every time. This approach is not included in the set up instructions, but might be helpful to others who have encountered similar problems. Aside from the initial difficulties, this is a good product."
1,Check with Your Serviceman First!,"This was a mistake on my part. I should have asked my A/C serviceman before ordering. When it arrived I called him to install the unit. He tried for 2 hours but could not get it to work. So I returned it.If you do order it, prepare to spent 20 minutes getting it out of its hard plastic case. Then have on hand an ample supply of batteries. I think it took 8 to run it.Unfortunately, even with the many batteries, it would not work.The GREAT news is that amazon.com credited my account without question.The reason I gave this product just one star (*) was to alert readers to be certain to check with their serviceman before ordering it."
5,This is their best bar by far,"Santanders 53% semi-sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one - the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich/creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and/or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life."
5,Absolutely Great!,"We are listening to it almost daily this Christmas season. If you are a Rippington's fan, you will love this CD. It features some of the same musicians such as: Jeff Kaskiwa (Sax) and Tony Morales (Drums). Two tracks stand out on this release. Track 2 (Faith) & Track 8 (Holiday). These are tracks that can be played all year long.Enjoy!"
4,A fine flavored coffee.,"The van Houtte K-Cups I've had have been very good, and that's true for this flavored variety (French Vanilla) as well. It's a medium-body coffee, and the balance of vanilla flavor is just right -- not overwhelming, just subtle and complementary to the taste of the java.I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, but I do like some periodically -- this one fits the bill of a very good brand and flavor for those occasions."
3,"good coffee, but the lids come unglued sometimes","We just opened a new box of this coffee, and out of the last 12 cups we brewed, 3 of them overflowed with grinds all over our machine because the lid came off of the cup.3-stars because the coffee is good, but with this high of a failure rate I'll not buy them again."
1,Compatibility Problems - Buyer Beware!,"This is the first negative review I have ever written for a product so it has to be pretty bad. I have used these Sony discs for 10 years and have never had a problem. I have burned well over 1000 in that time. I run a small Wedding video/Home movie tranfer business. I ran out out of my last 100 pack and even though I've seen a lot of bad reviews posted as of late I decided to stick with Sony out of brand loyalty... BIG MISTAKE! I recieved a dozen calls from people who can't play their discs on a variety of machines. I do test them on my HP pc and they appear to function fine as well as my SONY dvd player.After that it looks like hit or miss,of course Sony says there is no problem they are aware of. and since they play on SOME machines they are not completely defective. So bye-bye Sony time to move on and BUYER BEWARE!"
1,"terrible, terrible dvds","I bought these disks investing money and trust into the sony name, I am sorely dissapointed in this purchase, one out of every 4 or 5 disks actually shows up as a disk to be burned, meaning that while I spent money on a 50 pack, I actually got a 10 or 15 pack. Absolute trash, DO NOT BUY THIS."
5,4 Excellent Films!,"All of the films are great entertainment, although ""Dangerous Crossing"" falls a little below the other films in the quality of acting and performance. I highly recommend the set for the classic film ""Laura"" and seldom seen ""Black Widow."""
1,Not Happy,The product that came was not the product pictured. Had to return it twice.. Not Happy. The item was totally different from the one pictured on Amazon. This has never happened before.
5,Iron Jawed Angels,"In this election, with all the negative ads, it would be too easy just to ""not vote"". It seems no one is ""worth"" voting for.A friend sent me an email about ""voting"" and what how women suffered so that women would have this freedom.There was a link to ""Iron Jawed Angels"" in the email. Out of curiosity I clicked on it. It took me to Amazon and the movie was very inexpensive, so I thought I'll just order it, I have nothing to lose.After watching this movie, it changed my whole attitude toward our freedoms, that have been fought for by our forfathers/mothers.It is off the charts, I know it's a movie, but it will change your point of view, you will not be able to take so much forgranted ever again."
5,Women and the privilege of voting.,"I saw clips of this movie at a leadership training seminar. When I arrived home, I rented the movie and was emotionally and ""politically"" moved by this film. I purchased the movie from Amazon because I wanted to share the experience with other individuals, especially women. So often we forget the sacrifices made by those of our past. Through this film we (primarily women) can see that those sacrifices clearly give us the freedoms we have today. I highly recommend this movie."
3,Iron Jawed Angels,"A riveting portrayal of Alice Paul and the women's struggle while demanding the right to vote. When I first saw this movie, it completely blew me away and I loved every moment of it (excluding the unnecessary romance and masturbation scene - but hey, it is from HBO). However, upon watching it again I find more problems with it as a feminist as well as from a filming standpoint. A lot of poor shots that attempt to recreate the action impact ideology that is so attached to American film. Definitely worth a watch if you get the chance."
5,"Impactful - not just for ""girls""","I was skeptical when I saw an email about this video, so I ordered it from the Library and watched it with my boyfriend. It made such a huge impact on both of us we BOTH bought a copy. We're encouraging everyone to watch this video. Very true-to-life - no ""fluff"" and no ""sparkle"" - just the facts portrayed in a very professional movie format. I'll never take my right to vote for granted again. Ever."
1,"IMPORTANT SUBJECT, BADLY MADE MOVIE","I just finished watching HBO's Iron Jawed Angels, as difficult as it was to watch. The characters have no depth, the soundtrack overpowers the spoken words, and the music....did anyone notice the time period on this subject? Music for the 21st century was so completely wrong for this movie it actually shocked me that HBO put this together. The subject was serious and the women who stood up for ALL women's rights deserve to be spoken of with more respect than this HOLLYWOOD PIECE OF TRASH did. I have to wonder how much of this movie was based on actual fact and how much was ""created"" all in the name of the almighty buck! Shame on you HBO!!!"
1,ironed jawed angels,I didn't like the production of this movie. The subject matter was interesting but was presented with modern-day sensibilities. I had a hard time believing the actors because they appeared to be 21st century women playing early 20th century parts and didn't really exhibit the sensibilities of the time.
2,Dissapointed,I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago and it has completely stopped working. I did not use it often except to do the bathroom floors. I am very dissapointed ...... I expected better from this manufacturer.
5,Kia Soul Hamster,This little guy lives in our 2010 Kia Soul - he looks very cool sitting up front. Maybe we'll get a hoodie for him. :-)
1,Paranoid much?,"I was expecting a historical account of SIGINT, but what I found was on the verge of mysterious black helicopters and alien autopsies. I am not even half way through and I don't think I can finish it. Not only is some of the basic technical open source information inaccurate (try google), but a lot of his statements are suppositions or suspicions of an imaginative kid.If you are looking for a book that has accurate historical information about signal reconnaissance, try: The Price of Vigilance : Attacks on American Surveillance Flights by Larry Tart and Robert Keefe ( I initially thought Chatter was by the same author, big mistake!)"
4,John Charles Thomas In The 21st Century,"Most of the great recordings of this marvellous baritone were recorded on 78s. I would expect a lot of the originals used in these 78rpm transcripts to be Australian pressings, as evidenced by the clarity and low surface noise, qualities known worldwide as being attributes of Aussie 78s.The recordings appear generally raw; this is an extremely good thing, as there's nothing more disappointing than a transcript that has been so heavily ""cleaned up"" by computer software that it sounds like a transistor radio in a drainpipe!I would recommend this album to anyone wishing to aquaint themselves with, or revisit, this great American operatic baritone."
3,Worth with a price,"when it first came in it was very sharp but the blade got dull very very quickly after few cuttings. Every 2 of 3 days i rub the blade against a sharpening tool for few slides then it works great. i have been cutting chicken, beef, vegetables etc with it.. the handle is very sturdy and the knife weight is great in hands.."
1,AVID READER OF HISTORICAL FACTS,"Peter's book as many have previously clearly and rightfully stated, is a ""whitewash"" which downplays the true horrors of the Inquisition. I have read many books on the subject and to my knowledge the best and by far most accurate account on this dreadfull institution was written by Author: JEAN PLAIDY, Title: The SPANISH INQUISITION; it's rise, growth and end.None I have found, compare to the detailed, well documented, unbias, laborious, historical and factual reseach made by this author, on the true horrible events surrounding the Catholic Inquisition. If you're truly interested in knowing the truth and nothing but the truth...NO WHITEWASH...that's the book to read."
2,Sub-Par Book to LEARN from,"Used this textbook for a graduate course in 2009. That said, it's INCREDIBLY outdated. While very comprehensive and full of useful information, from a learning perspective, it's not very good. Examples are one of the major problems with this book. There are no labels for units during many of the example calculations and mysterious conversions pop up fairly regularly. The layout is frustrating as well, as many of the images, diagrams, charts referenced aren't on the same page as the written descriptions. You're better of buying a more up to date book. There's tons of them so you can't go wrong."
3,Missing DVD,"Rec'd package within a day of being shipped (nice!) but the DVD is MISSING!! Can't imagine how helpful the DVD would have been, however, I expect to receive product as advertised. The mat itself is ok...feels like really cheap vinyl. Not the same quality as the one used in Crossfit. Probably should have stuck to original plan of using a flat pillow and saved $35."
2,Low back support?,"If you have a back problem and you rely on the abmat to support your low back and protect you from injury your'e likely to get the opposite effect, particularly if low back extension hurts you. The reason why is simple, it supports the wrong side of your back. Back pain is produced when the hip flexors pull on the lumbar spine in the extended position, the abmat puts your low back in the position."
3,Too long but still good,I've used other ab mats at the gym and they arent as long so they fit better. Still very good for ab workouts and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to do full sit ups
4,Belkin F5X005 Auto Power Adapter for XM Inno,The product was delivered quickly and was just as it was described in the add. I am pleased with this product.
1,HATE IT,I ASK FOR THE PLUGE AND THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ONE AND I CALL THEM AND THEN THEY SAID I HAVE TO PAY 30.00 MORE. NO THANK YOU
1,Horibal Book Unless you already know what it is teaching.,"This book, as it is written by a PHD, is not conducive to learning new information. I could see it being good for someone looking to review all this knowledge, but for me there is no logical order to the writing and the book skips around. The chapter questions are ambiguous and over all if I was not having to read this book for a class, I would have burned it by now. I find it to be a total waste of time."
1,TERRIBLE,WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ITEM ONLY 1 HEAD PHONE WORKED AND THE MIC NEVER WORKED EITHER. YOU CAN HEAR FAIRLY CLEAR BUT MINE WAS BROKEN OR DAMAGED BUT IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN MINE.
5,Works like Muro 128,Don't know what the negative comments are about. Same ingredients as Muro 128. I use it for Fuch's Syndrome. Corneal edema. Save some money and buy this.
5,Very inspiring read!,"I was encouraged to find a book on spiritual growth that gets it right! Mr. Bridges' concepts rely very strongly on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring about success. He also encourages the reader to look up passages in Scripture that he refers to in the book by often only providing book, chapter and verse referances (without providing every passage word-for-word in his book).I'm currently reading his earlier book titled ""The Pursuit of Holiness"". So far, it isn't quite as good as this one. Some of it comes off as a little legalistic, but there are a lot of good points in it as well. Mr. Bridges obviously matured between his writing of ""Pursuit..."" and ""The Practice of Godliness"". If you desire to live your life in a way that is pleasing to God, and want some outstanding pointers, read this book!"
5,"If you're like me,","and couldn't care less what religion they're affiliated with, its just good rock music. Highlights are Phenomenon, Rawkfist, New Design, Last Words, and Bounce."
4,Music with a message.,This is an awesome cd for anyone tired of the violent lyrics of typical alternative style music. The positive message of this band is driven home with spunk and energy that even the hardcore fan will love!
1,Don't waste your money,"As a veteran SWAT officer I can find nothing positive to say about this ""Book"" Upon receiveing it, you notice it is bound by a cheap plastic spiral binder. It is in a dictionary style format with only the most basic of definitions. The illustrations appear to be drawn by an amatuer graphic artist. Some of the drawings are actually crude stick figures! There is nothing in here that will aid an active operative or an officer who strives to become one. It is especially bad when you consider how much this publication costs. I give it one star only because Amazon has nothing lower."
1,No audio or video for Kindle Fire,"I absolutely loved the TV show and bought the DVDs. I love this book also, but I purchased it for my Kindle Fire because the title says, specifically, ""Deluxe Ebook"" and ""Kindle Edition With Audio/Video"". I thought I was in for a remarkable experience. And for 15 dollars, not at all bad! As it turned out, it's just a book, a great book, but no more. No audio or video despite the name. Only Apple products with the Kindle app can play the audio/video content. Later I found that information on the product description page, so, all things considered, I should have been more careful, right? Still, a sour taste in my mouth."
4,Good read,"I did enjoy reading the book, I liked the story line but I found a lot of writing errors as I was reading this book. Did she have someone to proof read the book, unless it was because I brought it as an ebook."
1,Uncrowned ? Miss this one!,"This is a poorly written attempt to use reenactors to tell the life of J. Caesar. The guy who plays Caesar would be a great Marius, but Caesar was younger and better looking, and could act! The reenactors uniforms and equipments are 100+ years too late in period, (some are 300 years too late) and are about as good as using Franco-Prussian uniformed fellows to show the Napoleonic Wars! Don't waste your money on this horrid attempt to steal you denarii! Buyer Beware! Buy a Steve Reeves movie instead!"
3,"solid, but not outstanding","mr. roberts returns to the format he used on his previous album, ""gershwin for lovers"" for this set of cole porter standards with a couple of originals thrown in for good measure. the results are a fine reading of the porter songbook with each tune easily recognizable and downright hummable. but therein lies a problem. in the best standards collections, the tunes are revealed in the first couple of bars, but then the artist gives their own interpretation illuminating their own personal spin and relationship with each song--a fine example being any of the keith jarrett ""standards"" sessions, or even mr. roberts' gershwin set. mr. roberts offers very little new or extraordinary in his solos, and with eleven of the tracks weighing in four minutes or less, there really isn't much room for exploration. oh, well... if you love cole porter, this is a great set. if you love cole porter and jazz exploration of mr. porter's songbook, go with oscar peterson or mr. jarrett."
5,Herbs And Spices for Florida Gardens,"I needed advice and found it here. This is not just an herb book but also one of the best gardening books I've read. I've been a gardener and farmer all my life and I've looked over more of these books than I can remember. Bottom line, this will be a go to book now that I'm gardening here in Florida's challenging climate. Actually fun to read!"
2,cumbersome,"found it easier to just get on a ladder to do sanding, it was much more tedious trying to use this extension pole, the connection to vacume was poorly constructed and it broke."
3,Are they trying to be esoteric?,"This is a rigorous text on social choice theory that is very helpful for graduate students. However, there is so little discussion on how different findings are applicable to the real world. Social choice theory raises important issues for political theory, but these are addressed minimally. A much better book for those who want to learn about social choice but without so much math is William Riker's Liberalism Against Populism."
1,Haven't received,I ordered this book over a month ago and I need it for class. I cannot even give an accurate rating of it because I have not received it. I am thinking to ask for my money back.
2,Boring documentary with boring narrator,"Ok, I admit I only lasted 15 minutes into this. I thought it was a MOVIE not some documentary that someone with a horrible narrator voice would be doing about some crazy homeless person in Central Park. NO THANK YOU, not my cup of tea."
2,interesting story doesnt make an interesting film,"First off, let me apologize for only watching half the film before writing this review. For a while I thought...maybe it will change, maybe the end will redeem the beginning. Then I couldn't take it anymore. Maggie's story is interesting, intriguing, and portrayed in a respectful manner. The filmmaker is clearly truly interested in and affected by her and her story. But his flat voice interrupts all too frequently to give no further insight or commentary than blunty stating his growing interest. If there were more her, I think I would have been much more interested in it. As it is, I felt that the parts that showed her, rather than guiding and teaching us about her, illustrated his monotonous voice."
5,a fun winter decoration,"This is a fun and unique decoration. We usually get it out around Christmans and leave it out the entire winter. It is fun for the kids and somewhat elegant so it can be displayed in almost any home. I have given this as a gift and it has been well received. I like almost all of the Mr. Christmas ski/sled hills, although I only own one."
4,Cabaret,"This, the follow- up to the first release fron the 'knights'- a sign of the times - cabaret continues the modern- jazz filled pop instr. from the sixties. from title track Cabaret-(given a sort of comic arrangement) to Everybody Loves my Baby, given the same treatment as it's predesessor from 'sign' -'personality' to the 2 fun 60's pop of Behrke originals--the free jazz style of the 'miniskirt waltz' to rock the discoteque dowm 'castle holiday' A fine group of musicians from nyc- richard behrke keyboards & arrangement-producer Bob Thompson."
3,interesting..although with an important sound flaw..,"I just saw a documentary on the castrati, and studies say that the way of recording Moreschi a century ago didnt allow the full range of his voice to be recorded. Meaning, what we hear in the CD is not exactly what could be heared in person, back then.Anyhow, is great to have at least a sample of a voice and style that vanished in history."
5,Wonderful Slippers,These are wonderful slippers. They are actually more like a soft shoes than slippers. The sole is very thick and solid. They are comfortable yet quite durable. They give a lot more support to the feet than most slippers. The velcro fastener makes it possible for me to wear them even when my feet are swollen. I have problem feet and have difficulty finding shoes and slippers that are comfortable but these slippers I can wear all the time!
3,The Euros Do Country,"Here's an interesting concept -- a female from the Netherlands (Carole Van Dyk of Bette Serveert) and a guy from Belgium (Pascal Deweze) get together and write and perform a bunch of retro country tunes. Their English is faultless, and they have good, tight backing arrangements. Not too many of the songs are memorable, however. My personal favorite of their originals is The Battle. The homage to Jimmie Rodgers is poorly chosen, for some of the lyrics in Mississippi Delta Blues are embarrassingly dated and racist. The Chitlin's biggest influence appears to be Gram Parsons and they have chosen well their cover for him: the always beautiful Juanita is by some margin the best cut on the CD."
3,Eclectic McCormack,"This is a most interesting collection of McCormack in song. Many of these songs sung by McCormack on this disk I have heard him sing for the first time. McCormack sounds a bit awkward with his singing of The Battle Hymn of the Republic, and God Bless America. I rate this recording 3 stars not because if McCormack's defencies, but because of some of the poor quality 78rpm transfers. All the pops and hisses remain. A good digital transfer eliminates this annoyance so one can further enjoy McCormack's wonderful artistry. To hear McCormack's voice truly rise from the grave, I strongly recommend: McCormack in Song, Released by Nimbus"
2,Not satisfied,"The photo handprint keepsake is a great idea- it just doesn't work out so well. The clay is very hard to put into the frame, it makes a mess, and the handprint just wouldn't stay in."
4,Like it!,"I made mini Musubi with this. It is the perfect size for finger foods. Making my hubby something mini Musubi for this potluck. One thing you must do I found out is spray the mold with Pam or some other cooking/non-stick spray. It helps the rice slide right out! You do not need a lot of spray, just a touch. It makes a big difference. This is a nice product to have in your kitchen."
4,Great Customer Service,"Timely, great communication and good service ..when an error was made it was fully corrected ....it wasn't necessary as error was no biggie but still made it right! great to do work with and will again!"
5,Dryer fuse,Exactly what I needed and been working great ever since. I would recommend using them again for your electronic needs.
4,THE ORIGINAL MONSTER,"Black Sabbath's U.S. counterpart. This is the first and very satisfying album by B.O.C. It sports some of the finest of their songs, like CITIES ON FLAME, STAIRWAY TO THE STARS, as well as BEFORE THE KISS. I saw them twice in concert and their shows were nothing short of outstanding. It's nothing short of good news to find the extra songs and they are enjoyable."
3,topper,Beware the video with no image to view. I purchased this video expecting the movie and received the TV series instead. I enjoyed the series and you will too.
5,Very useful,"I have this heater in my bathroom since it's been cold in winter, and it helps a lot. It's true though that this makes a wicked crack sound when it's off - but it does not bother me that much. Just few times at night."
1,Did not work,My ferrets did not care and this did not bother them one bit. I ended up using bitter lime for dogs which is stronger and worked. When using this be prepared to wash your hands or taste it later.
2,Low quality product,"The shipping was speedy and the transaction went quite smoothly. The product looked exactly as the same one in the picture. However, I did not sactisfy at all since the quality was bad. The shifter was make from a low/cheap metal which was easily to be bended. Two cables came with it were also made from cheap and low cost steel. The cables were about 50% thinner and 50% slimmer than the cable that I purchased from the Bike shop. In addition, the shipping was also costly about $8.The conclusion, the product was not worth for the price. This is a good lesson. Don't always trust what you see from the picture. Picture can be deceiving"
3,"Buy ""Shut the F**K up and Dance"" instead","After hearing ""Shut the F*** Up & Dance"" I was really disappointed by this CD. Too many indulgent vocal samples added by Humpty Vision (yes, we KNOW you're spinning the music, we bought the CD for fooksakes) and some of the track selections are absolutely infuriating because they bring the energy level to an abrupt standstill. A lot of tracks are also too commercial/mainstream sounding and lower the gritty funky quality that characterizes Humpty Vision's better work."
3,so-so,This had some good information and the toning exercises were pretty easy to follow but I can't say that it helped me get back into shape. I wish I would have checked it out from the library first. I probably wouldn't have purchased then.
4,Pleasantly Entertaining,This is a different kind of romantic movie in that it has a number of scenes in Brazil early in the movie but then moves to the United States. There are extended sections in Portuguese and later in English but sub-titles are provided for the Portuguese sections which move by very quickly; we discovered we had to pause the movie in order to read the English translations.The movie is adequately paced and has some lovely scenery in both Brazil and later in California. The acting is satisfactory and the characters are of sufficient interest that one begins to care what happens to them.This is a chick-flick with a South American twist that is generally entertaining and fun to watch.
4,doogy gift,"I was a bit disappointed that the ""large"" size of this item was not a bit LARGER.... they're gifts for huge dogs. But they ARE nifty and I'm sure they'll enjoy chomping on them."
2,Sturdy?,"Our dogs loved this toy, but after only 48 hours of tossing, chewing, and playing with the toy, it literally came apart. First the rope came off, then the yellow covering over the stick. The dogs still play with the stick, but a stick from a tree would have worked as well."
4,very listenable live album,"I originally bought this album in 1970 and got addicted to it. In retrospect it sounds a bit cheap since it's all guitars without keyboards, horns, or strings, and the audience doesn't sound very large. Therefore power songs like ""Holly Holy"" and ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"" sound thin, but that's compensated by its high energy songs like ""Lordy"" and ""Thank The Lord For The Night Time."" Very listenable: I listened to it 3 times in a row after buying it on CD, although that's partly because there are only 10 songs altogether."
5,A wonderful guide to total well-being!,"This scientiffic yet very easy to read book proves beyond any doubt the link between positive thinking and good health (as well as between negative thinking and ill health). As must-have reading for anyone desiring a better, healthier, more enjoyable life!"
4,Big Burn by Jeannette Ingold,"I had read The Big Burn by Timothy Eagan. So on a recent trip, I stopped in Wallace, ID and this Big Burn was recommended by a person in the visitor center. So far, it is a good read. More fiction but also interesting"
1,One of the worst cookbooks ever,I consider the primary goal of a cookbook-regardless of the method of cooking--is to create palatable dishes. Apocolypse Chow misses the mark. There's no reason why cooking in this manner needs to sacrifice the taste of the food. I had to tweak every single recipe to make it edible. Bummer.
3,"Great book for collection, outdated and quirky","I bought this as a reference for helping people ""prepare"" for anything. I found it to be rather outdated and quirky - I'm not sure anyone really needs to be drinking when the power goes out. I don't regret the purchase, but can't say that I would recommend it as a current resource."
3,It's Vegetarian!!,"I feel very disappointed and mislead that the book description and reviews did not mention that the recipes are vegetarian. In fact, it is not until page 5 that this information is casually revealed. I really would not have purchased it had I known. But I'll give it credit for the recipes themselves - they are healthy and can be prepared with ease with or without power."
3,"Excellent idea, poorly edited","I live in hurricane country, and bought this book to be prepared for storm season. The authors offer a list of shelf-stable ingredients to store in a wine box, which could then be used to prepare a specific list of recipes when the power goes out for up to a week.Making my shopping list today I was disappointed to learn that the authors and their editor must not have checked the supply list against the recipes' ingredients. Many recipes required ingredients that weren't listed, whether by mistake, such as some main ingredient canned goods, or assumption that everyone would already have certain herbs, spices, and condiments that I didn't.I still like the idea of this book. I think that it would be helpful for people who live in parts of the country cursed with bad weather or earthquakes. But I'm disappointed by the quality of the editing. I still recommend the book, but you'll need to do some cross checking of its information to make it useful."
2,Unless you can read Old French...,"As the previous reviewer noted, this book contains entire passages of quotations in untranslated Old French. I am, admittedly, an amateur scholar/enthusiast, but I cannot believe it possible that a large percentage of this book's target readership is fluent in Old French! Would it really have been so much trouble for the editors to provide footnotes of translation?"
3,slow on the take off,"This razor is much slower on the start than the MX-500, so if you buy it be aware of that issue. I had to send the one back because it wouldnt pull at all."
2,"Doesn't shuffle CDs, doesn't play MP3s","Although this player has slots for 7 CDs it only shuffles one at a time. The manual says it plays MP3s but although it attempted to play them, it really struggled. On some MP3 it would insert loud banging noises and on one other MP3 it just locked up."
5,BUY ME!!!,"This video is great! I noticed a difference in my abs after just a week. The instructor is a little bizarre, but who cares if your waistline is shrinking! Look Great Naked Abs is definitely worth it! There are 3 different routines so you never get bored, and if you want a quicker workout you can just pick one of the three for a tough but quick session!"
1,Save your money!!!!,"This product is very poorly designed. The bubble chamber spills constantly and makes a huge mess. Neither of my kids wanted to play with it after about 30 seconds of trying to get it to work properly (they are age 3 and 6). I don't normally write reviews but this product was so junky that I felt I needed to let people know. We love all of the other Gazillion bubbles products that we've tried, but this one is a piece of junk!!!!"
1,Only Lasted Three Weeks,"Not a very good product. Made out of flimsy materials and does not get very hot. Took an hour to cook a hot dog. After only three weeks, it will not turn on. Don't buy it."
2,Needed it to work more than once,It worked great....ONCE. Maybe the next one will work a little longer. If it does I will review the oven again. Until then 1 star is being generous.
5,A GREAT BOOK!,I GOT THIS BOOK LAST WEEK AND THE FIRST TIME I READ IT I THOUGT IT WAS REAL GOOD!I`M A BIG TITANIC FAN!I COLLECT TITANIC STUFF!
5,"Pyle BLBW84 Blue Wave 8""","Used as a replacement speaker for JBL 80w powered subwolfer system, good bass but now I need a better power amp for the subwoofer system. Using a 20 watt reciever and still sound very good. The JBL woofer replacement is about $100, the Pyle BLBW84 are better. I got two by mistake and I'm happy I did. I only played $25 for 600 watts and 4 ohm woofer. A 100 watt reciever or power amp would be good for better sound."
1,This is terrible,When i first got the sub two of the wiring harness came off. Also was a first time user of a DVC sub and the terminals aren't labeled at all. After about two weeks of having it installed in my car it blew. I would not recommend this sub now i'm having to save money for another sub. I'm going for a Kicker this time. It's cheap and thats the only good thing about it. spend a bit more for something that is quality.
5,Great Bass,"When I purchased this sub woofer I didn't expect to hear a lot of punching bass, but I was wrong. This sub can push out a lot of bass, not as much as my Rockfords, but enough to rattle the glass of my Chevy Suburban. For the money you cannot go wrong with this sub!"
3,Just okay,"This is a good knife as long as you remember it was only $10.00. very well put together with steel running all the way down to the base of the handle then held with 3 large rivets. I don't think the handle is wood but it is made of some solid wood "" like "" product. The blade is a bit thin compared to higher end Japanese and German knifes I own, but they also cost 2 1/2 times more. Knife came dull and not sure how it holds an edge as I have only had it for 1 week. Had this now for several months blade chipped and does not hold an edge very long. Maybe better to spend the money on a higher quality knife."
5,young fan in (1977),"street survivors was the beginning of a life for an otherwisepre-steered southern youth. everyone has a predisposed ideaof changing the norm in musical dialect,in a form that rarelymoves emotion or social awareness,yet the original wild -eyed southern boys hit the ground running. tracks don't playaround on this gem.if you make one step towards discovery ofsouthern rock this is your shot at orbit ."
1,Soon You Will Understand that William Blank has nothing to say,"This ""book"" was a complete waste of time, money and paper. I've read fortune cookies that were more profound. ""You will be born."" ""You will grow up ...or not!"" ""You may marry .. or live alone."" ""Your work may be really meaningful ... or it will be boring but pay the bills."" I would have done better to buy myself a magic eight ball; at least that would have some resale value!"
2,Disappointing,This book was very disappointing. I did not even finish it. It was not what I expected it to be.
5,Pure enjoyment,Our 2nd & 3rd grade girls along with our 6th & 7th grade boys love going around the property on the 650 Razor! (It wasn't working correctly at first but after a couple new back wheels were sent we finally go it working.) We wish it had more power for hill climbing but in general it is a great thing for the kids. It lasts much longer than 40 minutes too. They ride it all evening and haven't been able to run it down completely yet!
5,great purchase,"These bikes are great. I had bought smaller bikes a few years ago and my boys loved them and rode them until they no longer ran. The decision then became to replace the batteries or replace the bike, but they needed the larger size, so i purchased the 650. My boys are 9 and 11, I only wish they made an even larger model."
3,Smaller than expected,"I bought this for my 9 year old son and he absolutely loves it. However, we were disappointed in the size. With a 220 lb weight limit we expected it to be a little taller and overall bigger. My son is almost to big for it. I wish we would have bought it for him when he was 6 or 7."
1,"WATCH OUT! Arrived with dead batteries and there is nothing that I can do unless I want to disassemle, re-crate and haul off.",TOTAL RIP-OFF! Arrived with dead batteries. Batteries will barely illuminate the tiny light on the throttle. I priced new batteries at BatteriesPlus Now I am a believer! I tried to save a few dollars and it cost me $165.00 + Be warned and buy local; with fresh batteries!
3,the 911 review,it was helpful in some areas but not all. You should try and find someone to borrow it from before buying.
2,Disappointed...,"I reserved this book at the library extremely anxious to read the contents since I try to regularly watch the show; unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed. Pretty much everything in the book drew from the episodes in their shows which I had already seen. Halfway through the book, I started to skim because I didn't see any point to what was being written. If I had never watched the show it would've been a better read, but if you watch the show regularly skip this book."
1,FULL OF TYPOS !!,"The book is not as good as I expected, there is a lot of retoric that everybody knows, but little about how to achieve certain things. Additionally, it is PACKED with typing mistakes: I guess they had not time to proof-read their work????!!!"
2,Just watch the Show,"I bought this book to assist me in my task of parenting. Well, after reading it a bit I was not very pleased with it. It basically referred to the television series episodes which if you watch the series, gives you some information without having to spend any money. I lent this book to my husband's friend's wife and have not seen it since. Not sure if she read it or what but not really a must have resource book for my at- home library."
4,Buy either the book or the DVD but not both,"Don't get me wrong, I love what these nannies do, the show is excellent, informative and funny. And the book is alright too...the thing is that is has the exact same content as the DVD's of Nanny 911, it even mentions the exact same families and their problems and suggestions. So if you already own the DVD then don't bother purchasing the book. If you don't have anything then purchase the DVD instead which is better than the book."
2,"it can play, but what about the recording or audio","ok... It can record 1080i an below, ok, now what about the audio.I don't want another HiFi Vcr. If I can dump 5.1 audio onto this machine. Then I feel it would be worth all the money there are asking. If anyone knows for sure of what it can do. Please Write an review to inform the rest of us.Thanks"
5,Love this series,"I wish that there was a second, third, season of this television show. I am sorry it ended so soon"
5,Wood highy reccomend.,Works great. I would order it again. I will also be able to use it as a basketball goal for my kids during the pool off-season. It will take 2 people to put together.
2,Rust,This product is leaving a nasty rust stain on my pool deck. They need to come up with a solution to this problem. I am not the first to complain about the rusting issues.
2,Slayer has just come to my town,"I just got this beanine baby today in the mail. It is a gift for a friend who wanted it very much. however seeing it's...price tag i thought it would be a large stuffed toy. however, it is only the regular small beanie baby!.... beware."
4,YES - NO DRIPS BUT HARD TO CLEAN,THE BUNN COFFEE DECANTERS ARE GREAT! BUT...MY HAND DOES NOT FIT INTO THE OPENING TO THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE DECANTER! I AM SOAKING THEM IN A BAKING SODA SOLUTION BUT I REALLY LIKE TO SCRUB THEM.
3,Required for College,Super fast shipping! I was required to read this for the teaching credential program in college. Semi-interesting book. Not one of my favorites.
2,Ineffective on Carpets!,"The Shark Roadster's sleek design and is lightweight and easy to carry around with it's included carrying strap; however, the three main tools are not as easy to manage. Three large, seperate, cleaning tools are given; however, there is no where to store them. We have wood floors, oriental carpets, and an upholstered sofa. I am constantly having to switch between the three tools, lugging them around the house with the Shark on my shoulder. In addition, the Shark works great on our wood floors, utilizing it's strong suction power; however, don't even bother trying it on carpets. The bristle brush for carpets gets stuck and is just horrbile (leaves them just as bad as when I started). Defniitely look elsehwere if you have carpets to clean."
1,You get what you pay for?,"We barely had this out of the box before we realized we should return it. The retractable cord didn't retract, for one thing, even after trying all the tricks in the book for that problem. In general though, we knew it was a cheap vacuum, but we didn't epect the parts and attachments to really seem *this* cheap. It seemed more like a toy vacuum than something really serviceable."
1,JUNK!,"This is the third light weight vacuum that I have bought that didnt last past 3 months (and I live in a one-bedroom apt., so I dont give it a lot of action.)You practically have to beg this thing to pick up dirt..Little suction. Rickety construction. Poor durability. Plus the on/off button is hard to find, and the cord pops out of the socket whenever you move! They obviously didnt do much user testing on this rolling hunk of junk.ENUF! I'm going back to a full body vacuum."
1,I ordered the st Andrews flag .what I received was an aqua blue flag I will never fly,This is not a St Andrews flag this flag is is aqua blue not like it's picture.It is so thin see through material. I will never fly this flag .
2,Does Not Keep Time,"This 24 hour timer does not keep time. It looses an hour every 3-4 days. This is a problem when using it for an aquarium, because the lights should turn on an off at the same time each day and not require resetting every few days. If one is away for 2 weeks it will fall behind up to 5 hours. I bought another device like this in a local hardware store for 220v. It had the same design with all the tiny pins around the out side and it lost time even more rapidly. So, I suggest staying away from all devices of this design if you require reasonably accurate timing. I have another G.E. device with slide out type pins and half as many of them. It keeps accurate time."
4,Great Food Companion,"This book has been a really great thing for me. Once you get used to looking up the foods you've eaten and see their point values, it really helps to get your eating under control. You eventually get to know how many points things are and only have to refer to the book occasionally, but it's still really nice to have around (just in case)."
5,Good deal,"Nice compilation of Dan Fogelberg - more complete and a better value than the Love Songs compilation. Only thing still missing is the mid 80s track ""Go Down Easy"" which was not a huge hit, though I'd have liked it to be included. Even without that, a very nice collection and overview of a late great artist."
3,Most Over Rated Songwriter Ever? Mediocre But All You Need,"This is as good as it gets with Dan Fogelberg which is to say very very mediocre. Has several good songs but unfortunately it is is missing several of his better songs (Scarecrow's Dream, Sketches, Dancing Shoes, Sweet Magnolia) but at least they did not ruin this CD by putting on one of the worst songs ever written - the horrible The Power of Gold. Listen to this once every few years and that's all you need from Amateur Dan."
4,Most of Dan's Best Stuff,"I have another (earlier) version of ""The Best of Dan Fogelberg,"" but it doesn't contain a lot of Dan's later songs. This one is GREAT. The only song missing, in my opinion, is ""The Raven."" Everyone in the family (12 year old, too) enjoys listening to this CD. It will get a lot of play time on this year's vacation!"
1,Not strong enough,"I have a heavy metal door for the main entrance to the apartment. I also don't have anything strong enough to drill into it, so I figured this self adhesive door sweep would work. It fell off after a few weeks."
3,big band,"The watch face is big, almost too big for my small, woman's wrists. The main problem is the band is way too large and it is not easy to remove links unless you are a professional jeweler."
3,Decent,"I have this watch. Got a lot of compliments, but eventually the little piece above the 12 fell off and the gold is coming off the band."
5,Well designed and glows in a black light!,"For those of you who mod your computers and have a UV light, this cable will glow for you.For the rest of us, this is a very well designed cable that unlike the standard flat ribbon cables, doesn't get in the way when you have more than one to contend with. The slim round shape allows for easy placement within your computer case. It also has an extra grounding line that you can connect to any of the mounting points on your case. The round cable also helps with air flow. It does not act like a big flat air brake for circulation.Use it like you would any other flat IDE cable, it is built to handle just about any IDE device out there, just better than the flat ribbon type."
2,"Important documents, atrocious sound","I suspect that the originals are simply in horrible shape, and were probably not well made in the first place, which prevents anything resembling decent sonics. All of the recordings suffer from unstable pitch, in addition to the surface noise inherent in such early material. The quality of the reproduction of McCormack's voice is high variable; in some cases, he's not even recognizable, and I wondered if that was due to poor pitching or an actual misidentification.So this one is only for McCormack completists. His singing is OK when you can actually make it out, but he developed a great deal in the few years after this. If you want early McCormack, look to buy the Naxos volumes, which begin, as I recall, around 1910, and are expertly transferred by Ward Marston."
2,Frail and more suited to occasional cleaning.,"I've read the reviews on the Shark. While it's not in the same class as the Vapor 2000, I think the Shark is getting a bit of a bad rap. Oh sure, it's a toy when compared to the might of the 2000. But the Shark is less expensive. My sister has a Shark and it does okay on small jobs, like cleaning around sink faucets. I don't believe the Shark was designed for heavier cleaning than that. And I don't think it will hold up to every-day use. So if durability and muscle are what you're looking for, go for the 2000. But you'll have to spend more than 100 bucks. I was willing to do that because I wanted power and a steamer that will last. But for those who don't have extra cash sitting around, the Shark is worth a look. Just don't be surprised if you have to send it back for repairs every now and then. The Shark is a frail cleaning machine more suited to occasional cleaning than every-day cleaning."
3,Does a good job- Be Extremely CAREFUL!,"The first time I used this item, I didn't know how to let the steam out before putting away. DO BE CAREFUL when opening the cap if steam is not expelled first! VERY DANGEROUS! I think the company does a very poor job of writing instructions for such a dangerous product.However... now that I have figured out how to work this thing, it did a wonderful job of cleaning my windows, my stove of spots that I thought I would never be able to remove, cleaned the tub surround in minutes with no horrible fumes, and got the built up dirt in patio door track almost instantly. Great for cleaning the toilet under the rim and in all those nooks and crannies. Still discovering many ways to use it. I would recommend it for anyone who is careful. Also, the steam is very noisy, and definitely would not recommend this around children or pets. Use common sense."
2,Maybe if it were $30,"After reading many of the remarks on this, along with other steam cleaners on Amazon, I decided I'd go ahead and buy it at a local Linens 'N Things store. The trigger on the wand didn't work, so it was clumsy trying to hold the steamer with one hand and work with the trigger and extension on the other hand. The 2 things I did find that it worked very well on was getting the buildup off of the aluminum shower tracks and cleaning behind the toilet seat where you usually can't get to with a cloth or scrubber. I returned it since I cannot justify spending $100 just to clean around the toilet and shower. In my opinion it should have been priced much lower...maybe around $30 - $40 for what it did. The concept of this is great, but for the most part I think using my cleaners and scrubber did a much better job. If there was one available priced more moderately, I'd buy it without hesitation."
1,Twice Burned,"I have now owned two SharkPro SC505 steamers in the last six months.The first was returned to the store after steam started pouring from the hose connections, I barely avoided being injured at that time.The second was a replacement for the first. I only used this one 6 or 8 times before steam quit flowing through the hose assembly. (...)"
1,Waste of $100,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have experienced the same problems. At first the steamer appeared to work O.K. However, it soon began to leak steam from the hose and became very dangerous. Today the cap seized and would not come off. The entire unit turns when you try to turn the cap. I will call the company tomorrow, and if I am not satisfied with the response, I will file a complaint with the State Atorney General's office."
3,"Works, not great, but works.","I read a lot of reviews before I took the leap of faith and bought this product. (...)It works fine. I have had it for two months and it does everything I thought it would. It is a slow process to wait for the ""light to turn green,"" i.e. for the steam to be ready, but other than that it is OK. One thing to note is that it makes a mess sometimes too. Sure you can get up stains and things with it, but the dirt and dirty water need to be cleaned up afterwards. Sometimes this can be quite labor intenstive itself. So, it is a good buy but it did not blow my socks off as it does those people on the TV. They really liked it, I just use it here and there and find it okay."
5,The best!,"This player is the best I've run across. It plays just about any disk media, and does a superb job. I have a JVC TV, and a JVC VCR. Connecting them with AV Comu-Link lets me put the disk or tape in and sit dow. The televion turns itself on, selects the proper set of inputs and plays.The picture quality is excellent,( you can really tell a bad transfer to disk ). I don't have a HDTV, so I can't vouch for the progressive scan, the regular picture is plenty fine for me.The DTS/ 5.1 outputs give you beautiful surround sound. Even through a small system like my AIWA bookshelf set-up- it is the only one I've seen with 5.1 inputs (but that's another review).The set-up menus are easy to navigate and very user friendly.The zoom and angle features are great, and the ""strobe"" button lets you see things fram by frame- AWESOME!A terrific player and a great price."
4,Marseille pre-view,"i had seen these classics years ago (1970's) when they came out. specifically, i bought FC2 to preview marseille prior to my first visit there! it was amazing how much was recognizable, walking in same spots at the movie action. it was a good move to make the purchase to see the city in advance, giving it such context. and the films (including the new york-based FC1) were still awesome!"
2,Simplistic and somewhat biased,"This was a required text for a class in gender communications. I suppose it might have been interesting had a been a young person with less life experience, but being a more seasoned student of fifty plus years, I found it to be pedantic, and a little condescending. Males are not presented in a fair light, and the author cites only those few lines of a study that support her predetermined viewpoint, including very narrow definitions of very broad subjects."
1,Propaganda,"While I don't doubt the author's intentions weren't honestly good, the prescence of society influenced bias is ever present.Just to point out a lone example from the first chapter, ""In general, African American women are more assertive than European American women, and African American men tend to be more communal than White men"".Notice how she cares to use extensive titles for women and African American men, but when she discusses European American males we are merely ""White"" males. So much for an unbiased presentaton :)"
4,Exiled,"i am not one to take to every sci-fi story out there. however, i was plesantly surprised with Exiled. it mixes my two favorite genres; sci-fi and alternate history. in terms of historical accuracy, it is right on. also, the author does not take too much liberty with the technology of the future. the politics and the cultural-relations are right on for the historical setting. personally, i enjoy the political intrigues that authors create, and the politics in Exiled are unique. i cannot wait for the next installment of the Exiled series, in print or on cd/tape."
1,This writer used my research without giving me full credit,"As actress Barbara Payton's biographer, I was dismayed to see some of my material on Barbara's life used, without permission or acknowledgment, in Lynn Haney's book. True, she does credit me with the story of Barbara being found unconscious under a dumpster in Hollywood, but some of her other statements about Miss Payton have been lifted directly from my Internet article on Barbara's life and times.Ms. Haney, I am very easy to get in touch with (my contact information, in fact, appears with the aforementioned article). May I ask WHY you didn't seek me out to ask for permission to use my work in your book on Mr. Peck's life? Believe me, I would have happily granted you permission (with appropriate credit given to me, of course)if you had only taken the time, and care, to ask.Not good, Ms. Haney. Not good at all!"
2,not as good as rated,"This product was supposed to be new. It was not. It did not have an ink insert, so I had to go out and buy ink. By the time I was finished, it had cost the same as a new one at the local store, where it would not have taken days to get to me. Boo, hiss, not happy, me."
1,Junk,"The title say's it all, JUNK. Does not stick well at all. I learned my lesson the hard way. Stay away from this one."
4,Good Product,Good ProductEasy to UseWould probably work for others - my door has a large gap so it wasn't tall enough for that. It would've been perfect if it were half an inch longer.I don't know if the adhesive would be strong enough for people who have carpets. It's kind of easy to remove. Be careful if you painted your door because it might remove the paint.
1,Hawaii Five-O... Blank Discs?,"There is a major quality control issue with Season 11. The discs play as far as the WARNING, do not copy, do not pirate... And from that point on show NO CONTENT. I may as well have bought blank discs. The same problem exists with Season 9 which I bought as seasons 1-9 of this show. As for Season 10, which was bought at the same time as season 11... I have yet to receive that. So tell me what is really going on here? If you are looking for Seasons 9, 10 or 11 of this amazing TV show, chances are you will either not receive it, or will end up with blank unplayable media. Have been in contact with Amazon to try to get this resolved, but truly getting a run-around which is somewhat unsettling... I would rate this as ZERO stars..."
2,"Good size and shape, but highly breakable","Even though I like the shape, I would not buy this again.We've taken to super-glue on the handle to hold it on. It broke about a year after we got it.Also, it's sort of heavy, which is lame for moving it around between counter and table, etc."
2,"Started out great, but......","I loved this iron but after 6 months of use, it just quit working. Sunbeam replaced it with a much lower model iron. I wish I had returned it to the company I bought it from instead."
3,How Windows XP really works.,"This book was written by two men who were an integral part of designing and implementing the Windows XP operating system. For the general reader:""fugget about it""!. For those with a good knowledege of operating system fundamentals, a book that will allow you to become more knowelable about operating systems."
3,too expensive!,"I think this was a wonderful thing to play, but it was just too priceyfor the 3 games you get! ..."
3,It does what it's supposed to.,"Our house is freezing in winter and putting plastic up has helped tremendously. We've had three brands, and I put that this one is ""okay"" because one of the brands was not as good and I'm not sure which, though I know it was the cheapest. It had to do with the tape. This year, I doubled up the plastic on the breeziest of windows and it's helped. At some point, any of the brands are likely to have the seal break in a place or two and I tape them back down. I've come to realise that that is due the the forceful gusts that come through our old creaky windows during storms, as it doesn't happen in the windows that are a little more sheltered."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS, WASTE OF MONEY","I fully charge it for at least 24 hours and last for about 2 minutes of use. There are more lemons in the ocean.STAY AWAY, WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Worked Great then the decline,I bought this product about a year ago and for a while it worked great. Then I noticed that the unit was starting to shut off faster and faster until today when I finally decieded to toss her. Overall in the beginning yes there is alot of power but what is the good of it when the battery's life is only about a year before she goes. I wouldnt recommend one especially since Dirt Devil came out with a cyclone one which I will try with hopefully longer lasting results.
1,Bad product - worse customer service,"This vacuum is quite loud, did not have a whole lot of suction, and seemed to run down the battery within minutes of use. Trying to replace a part was a nightmare. Though their customer service person was polite enough, and tried to be helpful, it was clear that she knew very little about the product. And, it took months... to get the wrong part. We gave up."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I received the 14.4 volt vacuum for Christmas 2004. After a full charge, it lasts less than a minute. It would be great if the battery lasted, but it doesn't. Go with another product and save your money on this piece of junk."
5,Middle East Cookery,"Very easy-to-follow Syrian cookbook. Brings back memories of my grandmother ""Sita"" making all of these things."
4,Great little book,"While not the best, it has a lot of great recipes and the majority work well and allow for tweaking."
2,Auras,"The best thing about the book is that it is short. I do not see auras, but I guess if some people actually see them it would be interesting to them."
1,Tommy Hilfiger Surfs Up,This is false advertising. It is titled pillowcases but when you place an order only one pillowcase is shipped. I ordered 2 sets of pillowcases for 12.99 a set and was shipped 2 pillowcases. When I complained amazon sent 2 more pllowcases and then charged me again. I tried to response several times and received no reply except amazon stating they are charging for 2 more pillowcases.
3,reasonable compilation but be warned,"this is a reasonale compilation of canned heat's songs but bye no means the best,just a warning to save people money,if you allready have the canned heat anthology cd then with the deluxe editoin you are paying just for the cd to be in a box and a small badge with canned heat on it."
4,fine,I got my airconditioner before i got the density foam and couldn't wait to install it so it is still in the package but looks like it would do a good job.
1,Who are the A-holes responsible for this??,"This book is absolutely riddled with errors!! Not only is the ""answer key"" often wrong, but various formulas given in the book are also missing components. This book should be taken off the shelves. And Mr. Moyer, Ph.D. or not, should be permanently banned from writing instructional books of any kind."
2,It has some problems,"There were several things about this film that made it hard to watch.The first and foremost was a scene with Billy Bob Thornton and Lemmy. Lemmy talks about being interested in Little Richard's music. And Billy Bob takes the opportunity to make a homophobic comment, advising his son not to ""sit on his lap"" and laughs.The second is more simple, It went on too long and I wasn't interested enough in the character to keep watching."
1,Poor quality,"This knife set for a new product, is very diappointing. I'm returning mine. Out of the box it looked cheap. I agree with other reviewer that the little plastic inserts on the block don't stay in. You have to peal if off the knife everytime you pull a knife out, to put it back on the block-CC needs to try some glue to hold them in. CC makes much nicer sets for less money-this would be a hassle to use to use and why pay more a poorer set?"
3,quality not up to par,received to replace a old set and always thought chicago was a good brand but it was not up to par in the quality department
4,Great Price for quality knife set,"I normally would not have bought a knive set on line. But I knew that the name was a good brand, and after searching some of the larger department stores, I decided to buy the set. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the butcher block that the knives set in - the set is beautifully designed.. I have not had to sharpen any of the knives yet!"
2,They rust!,"TheyChicago Cutlery Landmark 12-Piece Knife Block Setall have gotten full of rust spots. I have old wood-handled chicago cutlery, which doesn't rust. I received the brand new set as a gift, but I'm disappointed that they are covered with rust since the first time through the dishwasher. The company doesn't care, I called and they told me to get barkeeper's friend to remove the rust, and to wash and dry them by hand. Really!!! My old set goes through the DW perfectly!"
3,What exactly are you looking for?,"First of all, the book is about 6 inches tall. My sandwiches are bigger! And the font size is about 4 so it's kind of hard to read. Now, that being said, it is very informative if you want to know the history of photography and you want the ""implied meanings"" of the photos and ""what the artist was trying to convey"". It has really helped me fall asleep on several nights."
5,"Why we need ""beautiful"" pictures?","I strongly disagree with Graham Wills' review of the following:""Even the picture of Marilyn Monroe is an odd one; technically only average, revealing little about her, the text invites us to consider the meaning of the chair beside her. I would have liked to have seen more photographs that are there because they look beautiful."" I don't know what does ""they look beautiful"" mean? For a person lack of basic aesthetics training, that means ""simple"", perhaps. Because she/he could only understand the appearance of a subject, not the meaning of a photograph(what the photographer really want to say in her/his work). Ian's review is a must for all serious photographers."
4,Excellent survey of photography from it's birth,"This book shows what amazing and inspiring pieces of art can be created with a camera.Each of 500 photographers is represented with a single photograph. Every possible period and genre is represented and since the photographers are simply presented alphabetically, the contrast from picture to picture can be striking.An excellent book, and it's available in both ""coffee table"" and ""night table"" sizes."
5,One of the greatest books I have ever read in my life!,"Truly one of the most beautiful, profound and hilarious works of literature in the past....forever.Christopher Spranger takes a sadly forgotten genre (the aphorism) and infuses it with his unique brand of pathos and hilarity.One of a kind."
1,Pretty Lame,"If you want to hear this guy brag about his accomplishments and his life story...then you may enjoy it. Your time is probably better spent reading another book. It's literally ""I, me, my"" throughout the entire thing. Though there are some bits and pieces of good info...it could be summed up in one or two pages."
4,Excellent Resource,"This textbook serves as an excellent resource for water system modeling. It goes through everything from model theory, to model development, then tells you how to use it. Includes important sections on testing and calibrating, which are sometimes not given the proper attention while developing models. Also includes many examples. HM did a great job in putting all this information in one place! Thanks!"
4,A comprehensive source for water modeling need,This is one of the best sources of information for water modelers. Chapters are well organized and the information is comprehensive and focuses on the practical aspects of water model development.
4,Carlton's Review,"I am a civil engineer for EBMUD, a water provider in the Bay Area. This book is a great handy reference guide for any engineer dealing with hydraulics. It is similar in usefulness to Lindeburg's Professional Engineering Reference Manual.Positives: Easy to use, simple explanations,good examples. Great reference for steady state analysis.Negatives: Valves and appurtanances are not described in too much detail as far as mechanics. I realize it is not the focus of the book. Furthermore, there isn't much discussion on transients -- again, not the focus of this book."
4,Teaching Old Dog New Tricks,"I had been out of the water distribution design field for several years and had not had opportunity to utilize updated information and models. The ""Water Distribution Modeling"" book has helped to me to recover past knowledge lost and to become updated on new modeling procedures.This Book has been a big help."
5,Water Distribution Modeling Review,"This book provides modelers with just about everything we need in one place, and it is rarely more than an arm's length away from my computer!The chapters cover the topics that modelers encounter from creation of the network to the finer points of calibration. Since it was written by Haestad Methods staff, it compliments the WaterCAD software perfectly. The illustrations are clean and simple, and are great tools for explaining information to non-technical staff and clients.I would recommend this book to anyone using WaterCAD."
3,Wiley Review,"Review of: Water Distribution Modeling by HaestadThe limited amount that I have used this book has been very helpful for fire flow and water distribution calculations. I used this for both of these on two projects to date.1. An eight unit residential building with fire flow.2. A ten acre commercial shopping plaza with eight buildings and an extension for future development.The book proved useful to determine pressure drop in the water mains from friction, flow, and elevation.I only rated it a three, since I have not used it extensively. The rating for the usage to date would be a four.Wiley K. Zabel"
4,I recommend this book,I took advantage of a special offer to purchase Haestad's WaterDistribution Modeling book. The book is very well structured and contains a wealth of information. This book gave me the opportunity to review basic water distribution engineering principles and to learn more about the advanced water distribution topics.Excellent reference book for the junior to more senior water distribution modeler.
5,Well done!,The book is very well written and organized. It can be considered a very helpful tool in terms of educational support as well as basic consulting.I would recommend the book for academic and professional purposes in the field of hydraulic engineering.
5,The best modeling book I've read!!,"""Water Distribution Modeling"" is the most comprehensive books on this subject that I've ever read.It starts off with the basics and proceeds to cover every aspect of water system modeling, including quality modeling. As a plus, the book comes with an academic version of Haestad Methods water modeling software. Those of you who fought with the original Kentucky Pipe program will find this software a dream come true.Another advantage is that it interfaces directly and seamlessly with ArcView GIS software. If you already have your water system in a GIS you can import it directly into the modeling program, run your analysis, and export the results back to ArcView. My only complaint is that neither the book nor the software tells you that you need a ""node attribute table"" to make it work.All in all, this is a great book. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in water distribution system modeling."
4,Great Hands On Manual,"This book better yet ""HandsOn"" Manual is a must for all municipal systems. Its practical yet detailed and for me, a none engineer has provide much in the way of background on the subject of distribution systems."
2,Lots of basics. Some TOO Basic.,"There are instructions on how to use a shower faucet in this book. Specifically, how to pull up the diverter knob to make the shower nozzle produce water. Like what you do in your home bathroom every day. And instructions on how to use an ATM machine. I kid you not.In its defense, it does give a general overview of black and grey water tanks and basics about hitches and the types of RVs that exist and I'm sure the authors meant well. But there are some really dumbed-down instructions about ordinary things you already know about. Its almost insulting. There are much better books out there that dont assume you are mentally challenged!"
4,Enjoyable and fast reading,Very helpful and easy reading. Also purchase the RVer's Bible (by Kim & Sunny Baker) if you want to really be prepared with your RV!
2,ok,"this is ok, but the water drains very slowly when this is used even when it is clean and just water is running through it. When hair is caught through it, forget about the water draining."
2,Just a plug,"Catches everything, even lint from flannel sheets after I wake up. You'll be cleaning this thing out after every single shower...and I have short hair and not even balding (yet)."
2,It's ok,this is more country/pop. like faith hill is now or keith urban. If you want country country I suggest Gary Allan or Brad Paisley
1,not all is as it appears,"not only is the photo a mis-representation of this product but also how it ships to you. The free super saver shipping while it is free, the top of the page states free two day shipping if ordering whithin a certain time frame, I.e 4 hours and 12 min. it arrives in about two weeks or more, so don't be in a hurry if you want a break on shipping cost."
3,disappointed,"It was great in the windy, rainy days in NYC ... until it broke. I've had it for under 2 years and for the price I paid I expected it to be a better, sturdier product."
5,Strong and just the right size,This little guy fits perfectly on to my laptop bag without creating too much bulk. I've used it a few times and had no problem opening or closing it. I have yet to encounter any excessive wind conditions but I'm confident it will hold up better than any of those cheap folding umbrellas purchased off the street. I bought two of these. One was for my wife and she's just as satisfied as I am.
1,Good while it lasted...,"The umbrella is relatively well designed but it did not last as long as the study design might make you think initially. The plastic bits where the spikes join with the periphery of the canopy are poorly made and easily get torn from the canopy. Because the spikes are not attached to them permanently, once the bit breaks off from the canopy, you lose it in the dirth and you cannot repare the umbrella. I was much happier with my London Fog before I got this one."
5,From the windy state of KS,"We keep a GustBuster umbrella in every vehicle, and absolutely LOVE them. The GustBuster has stood up to the strongest rain/wind combinations we have encountered without breaking or inverting. I purchased this one to give as a gift, and will be back for more to give (as I no longer have to keep getting new ones for myself since the GustBuster Metro has held up so well)."
3,Worked until it didn't,"As promised the umbrella never inverted. However, very strong wind can tear the fabric right off the metal spokes. That's what happened to mine after about six months which was a bit longer than I usually have an umbrella but not longer enough to justify the price."
2,Disappointing,"I got this after my previous umbrella died in a windstorm. It was never really tested (no wind.)It looked nice, but a few problems:- the handle was flopping around loose. Not debilitating, but very annoying;- it would not stay closed: the slightest jar would pop it open again unless restrained by the two straps. Annoying when closing to go indoors, etc.;- two of the metal struts that attach to the hub broke: not the wire that usually breaks there, but the struts themselves. The struts themselves are quite substantial, but their ends are very poorly made.I'm not trying another GustBuster unless they get a handle on quality control: the design is good, the construction much less so. Don't lose your warranty card: there is ZERO information online that I could find."
2,GustBuster,GustBuster Metro 43-Inch Automatic UmbrellaDisappointing! Mechanism was impossible for me to work (and I am not weak!)
2,Won't Stay Closed/Collapsed,"I ordered this umbrella and also another one at the same time (ShedRain WindPro Mini Umbrella Auto Open & Close). I had to return the GustBuster because the telescoping/spring-loaded handle wouldn't stay collapsed. I'm assuming this flaw isn't normal or else nobody would buy their umbrellas. That said, the other umbrella I bought (ShedRain) was much sturdier in comparison. The two umbrellas are pretty much identical in functionality (both have similar ""gust resistant"" features) but the ShedRain is higher quality."
1,Very Disappointed,"If you believed the company hype behind this umbrella, you'd think this was the best umbrella ever. I wanted to like this product and was willing to pay more for a quality umbrella. The Metro model I bought though just didn't hold up. What happened? The Velcro on the closure strap came off, the threads in the understructure gave way, the plastic tips came off the ends so I had to manually put them back on, with my hands full, in the rain of course, and finally, one of the elastic straps just plane ripped.I called customer service and they said they would fix it if I sent it back AND included $10. $10? No thanks. After reading the other reviews and seeing that this wasn't an isolated incident, I'll take that money and buy a competitor's umbrella. I expected years of use out of an expensive umbrella and this is just like an umbrella you'd buy at your local drugstore, maybe worse."
2,Mistake.,"This umbrella is a waste of money and a piece of garbage.I unfortunately lost what seems to be a great umbrella that's just not made anymore and purchased this one. Mistake. I had to re-glue the tips on to the frame of the umbrella in two spots, twice.Would never purchase this brand again.ShedRain. It's the way to go. Lesson learned."
3,It is too small for a big man,"the quality is good. I want a moderately sized automatic collapsible umbrella about 46"" dia."
2,not,"made sure i wanted to get the best quality, even if i had to pay more!i wanted to avoid having to buy all those flimsy, ""good for one-use"" only umbrellas you buy from the pharmacy or convenience stores.so, i purchased two of these for me and my friend. in a few months, the cord from the wooden handle came off. the little black caps came off and i had to glue all of them for both umbrellas. i made sure that we let it dry/stand before storing them as indicated in the directions/manual that came with it. and we were not even using the umbrella everyday. quality for price is disappointing!"
3,"Good protection, but heavy and lacks quality","I've had this umbrella for 5 years now.As an umbrella to use while raining:* Yes, this umbrella provides nice protection.* Even though Chicago is dubbed as the ""Windy City"" for political reasons, it really can get windy here. The open umbrella has never inverted on me.As for the product when it's not in use during the rain:* In my first week of owning it, I dropped it on the sidewalk once, and the wooden handle got dinged and chipped.* The silver metal rods have all come out of the black end caps, so I've had to superglue them back into place.* It's also a heavy and bulky umbrella. I cannot believe how much weight it adds to my work bag. I can barely zip it into my Longchamp Le Pliage."
3,Hasn't Broken Yet- That's All I Need,"My standards for umbrellas aren't too high. I'm a man who bought most of my previous ones at Walgreens in a panic. This one, however, is a step above. Large, effective, and difficult to break. I'd recommend it if you need serious coverage. Try it out."
1,Gustbuster folding umbrella,"The umbrella is heavier than I expected. But, the worst thing is, it is 16 inches long and does not fit in my purse. It is 6 inches longer than the one I had been using. I regret not buying the shorter, 14 inch manually operated model. The longer length is not convenient for traveling."
2,"will NEVER flip, but...","What you read is true. the canopy of this umbrella is durable and will never flip on you. HOWEVER......the handle is not ergonimic, made of a cheap wooden/plastic blend material that's really uncomfortable to hold, and slips easy out of your hand in moderate winds if wet. handle eventually broke and the metal wires that keep the umbrella open all popped out of their protective pegs so i risked poking myself or someone else in the eye every time i used it.no auto-close. The windproof is great, but what good is that if the rest of the umbrella breaks on you so easily?"
2,Great idea. Poor Application. Bad Customer Service,"One of the hinges lost the peg for an arm, so the two pieces of an arm are just loose. This happened by the 5th use. I called customer service and they wanted me to: send them the umbrella (cost ~$10 to buy a box for this oddly shaped item), and give them $10 to ship it back to me. ~$20 to get it fixed? 2/3 the cost of a new one? What a joke. Some ""guarantee."""
2,Doesn't blow inside out but poor quality otherwise,"I have had this umbrella for two years, maybe I shouldn't expect it to last very long. It is true, the umbrella doesn't blow inside out but the quality of it is otherwise terrible. The fabric is disintegrating, all of the caps pop off of the spines so I have to put it back together every time I open it, and some of the caps have ripped because the fabric frayed. The fabric is disintegrating at the top also. I would definitely not buy another one. It started falling apart over 6 months ago and is barely functional at this point."
3,Great for King Fans...and that's about it.,"Ok, this movie scared the daylights out of me as a kid. However, when re-watching it, I realized just how dated this movie is. The first section, The Woman in the Room, is pretty eerie, although extremely simple and short. The directing was really good, however we are talking really low budget here. The second movie was...borderline terrible. The plot and the characters both are undevloped. I felt like I was watching some kid's video production project. The only reason I gave this movie three stars was I felt the directing and the acting in The Woman in the Room was really good. It's no action-packed, fast paced story by any means, but I was emotionally affected. So if you are big into studying film, or just a big Stephen King fan, check this out. But don't go breaking your neck to see it."
5,Re-issue of a remarkable CD!!,"This important, influential and in all ways amazing CD was groundbreaking when it was issued in 1992, and it still is! First recording of Fanny Mendelssohn's Overture -- and still the only one! Also wonderful, powerful works by Clara Schumann, Lili Boulanger, and Germaine Tailleferre. In stunning performances by the legendary Women's Philharmonic of San Francisco. This CD put JoAnn Falletta on the map!"
5,Water World Science Fiction,"I love water based fiction. There is so little of it. I first read reef song when I was in middle school. It was a book that I picked up at the library. It was also one of the books that catapulted me from Young Adult stuff into more intense, conflict and character driven science fiction.Reefsong is about a very driven woman who is pushed from one element into another. She has to deal with problems and she does it without spending excessive amounts of time bemoaning her own loss and change. She is not happy but that does not mean she is going to put aside her task and whine about life not being fair.The main feel is colonial vs big company.The cast is an interesting mesh of adult and juvenile. The evil people are evil and greedy and it is satisfying to see them loose. The science is fun and it works in the story. It is a very satisfying read."
2,I am rather disappointed in it.,"It does not include many of the musical pieces and composers I had expected-- and would have liked;nor was the quality of the recording up to par. I do like the COVER art, however."
4,Always good.,You cannot help being interested in Mr Crisp. Very eccentric and funny and I agree with wanting to be as far away from the UK as possible.! Viva NY!
3,Good and Bad,"This bundle seems like such a great deal.Problem is the Storybook Weaver program will not work on any Mac system after 7.0. But you can't find this out until you buy it and wonder ""Why do I keep getting error messages?"" The newer version is available only to schools at $... So if you have a Mac, this program will probably not work. What a disappointment.The math game is great! My seven-year-old homeschooler loves it. It includes a wide variety of math concepts - grouping, time, money, etc. And Kid-Pics is always fun. I guess it's still a good deal. But it would have been good to know that we were only getting two programs when we bought it."
2,Pretty and unusable,"I got intrigued by this deck of cards when I saw a few cards like the Four of Wands. It has a dark atmosphere and shows the four wands in a creative way, like a fence. The Ten of Swords is also excellent so my first impression was that the rest of the deck will fit into the ""dark and innovative"" category, but I was wrong.As I got the deck and browsed through it, I noticed there are too many pictures of naked women for my taste. Though I don't mind the nudity in principle, the artist uses it liberally, where it fits and where it doesn't.For example, Five of Disks is ""Worry"" in Crowley's deck. Rider-Waite's Five of Pentacles signifies material trouble. On that card, Archeon Tarot - which is based on Rider-Waite - shows a sexy young female angel. While the more cynical among us would see the connection between pretty young women and financial trouble, it doesn't work for me as a tarot reader.Four stars for artistic quality, one star for usability."
2,"A NICE IDEA, HOWEVER.........","I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE UNITS A YEAR AGO, ITS VERY NICE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT IT DOES NOT OFFER CALL WAITING CALLER ID, AND IT BROKE AFTER A YEAR OF USE. I DO NOT RECCOMEND IT"
2,Not what I expected,"Nick is simply telling you about his life. I expected the book to contain more information on specific tennis knowledge that could help a player improve his game, but I guess Nick does not have any. Or maybe he will not tell you about them unless you enroll in his expensive academy. However, Nick worked hard in his life and that is what you can hear about again, rather than learn, from this book - it takes hard work and dedication to be successful. If you are looking to improve your game, DO NOT buy this book. If you are trying to kill time or want to know more about Nick, buy it."
4,Did the trick,I put in an accent light in the rear of my property for a interesting tree. Needed a way to power it without doing significant wiring. This helped make it work..
4,quietly heartbreaking,"this story is well-conceived and the main character is an interesting study in distancing and alienation from loved ones. the plot could have used more fuel, and the writing requires concentration without being entirely involving, but luther albright's climactic realizations are carefully orchestrated, unsettling, and sad. be prepared to be patient with the mental maneuvering of a man who is so overcontrolled that he only occasionally simmers with emotion."
2,Too insular,"Although the writing is quite nice in some places, this novel becomes quite numbing in it's glacial pace. A novel about an ordinarly family has to have a universal appeal, but this book is an endess exercise in self-indulgent navel-gazing. The detail is so minute and insular that you're left gasping for air. And books where the protagonist is so unnaturally self-aware and insightful bothers me. If he was this in tune with his family, then his emotional distance does not make sense."
2,Slow and weak dialogue,"I found this movie to be slow and plodding. The acting, with the exception of the main character was weak and tired. I expected much better, as I enjoy these types of real life movies."
2,Save your money for a gym membership,"Like most people, I wish there was a magic cure for cellulite, but there is not. After 3 months of nightly use and scrubbing my butt and thighs with a brush, I can't say I saw any improvement. The only thing that helps with cellulite is weight loss. It does make skin soft, and there is no noticeable odor if you want to give it a try, but you might want to save your cash for a new pair of athletic shoes."
5,Dylan grows UP!,"I have always particularly liked this album, albeit with the manyscratches and creaks of the well-used vinyl. Here, on CD, it comes through loud and clear, with one of Dylan's masterpieces,""Hurricane"", and lovely duets with the bell-voiced Emmy Lou H.Emmy Lou surrounds Dylan's fuzzier vocals with a harmonic linewhich demonstrates how sweet and ringing his songs can be. Whenhis lyrics are harsher, this might not work, but on this album,longing and belonging to are themes(as in the revealing ""Sara""), that go well with Dylan and Harris' cooperative effort. Not a badplace to start for a novice, as this album is very accessible."
4,"Great Poster, but not 24x36","The poster is exactly as pictured. However, the measurements are smaller than 24x36, about 22x28. Despite that, I am glad I purchased it, it's a very nice quality poster."
3,Decent but dated,"This Aurra Sing is based on the costume from an Aurra Sing comic. She doesn't have ANY articulation in her arms (although her shoulders move); her only articulation is in her neck (can move left or right), shoulders, and legs (but not knees or feet). She comes with a huge sniper rifle, and a neckerchief. One of her pistols is removable, and can be held in her hand, but the other is painted on, and is part of her leg. Her fingers are also freakishly long, which is a little off-putting, since she's supposed to be near human.If you're looking for an Aurra Sing figure, I'd recommend the new Clone Wars figure based on the animated series."
2,Not very good quality,I am so amazed that people can get away with selling such poor quality merchandise. You could barely make out some of the movie because the visual quality just wasn't there. Very disappointed over my purchase. No more for me! Tired of buying crap!
5,If you only own ONE,"If you only own one Dylan album, make ""Bringing It All Back Home"" the one you own! It's a good even mix of folk/rock and folk. Every song is an instant classic and the songs that had a message back in 1965 still hold relevance today. The most well-written song on this package has to be ""It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"". As you listen to these lyrics and think about modern times you realise that Bob is STILL onto something. This album also features the hits: ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man""."
4,Johnny's in the basement...,"If you get a chance, you tube Subteranean Homesick Blues (spell it right, though, these reviews don have spellcheck!)---he invented the music video 15 years before MTV! Don't like Dylan? Then go soak your head! (lol---Merry Christmas.)"
5,All Good Stuff,"There are no limits with Bob Dylan. He sings about it all....God....the jews....the rest of the world...the good, the bad and the ugly....the innocent the weak...the rich, the poor....every one in every walk of life.....he's in a class all of his own and will go down in history as one of the most celebrated and appreciated artists of our time.Milly, Mississauga, ON Canada."
2,Last couple pages were ripped out,"I bought the book I love you More. I choose to buy this book because it's such a short, child's book and was like $12-15 in the store and thought it seemed cheaper than that. I purchased this book and as I received it in the mail, 2 or 3 pages had been missing. I was very disappointed to have received a defective product. It wasn't terribly cheaper than what was in the store. I would've paid more for the book rather than have pages missing."
3,Cute but not very sturdy,"This watch is adorable but there are two problems I have found with it.1) The Mickey and Minnie heads cover the 4, 5, 7, and 8 so it makes it difficult to tell exactly what time it is2) The part on the strap that holds the excess strap down broke after less than a monthOther than that it is cute and somewhat functional."
2,Owned It and Took it back,"I bought this unit at Home Depot and found it could not even heat a 10 x 12 office room. If you want a heater that puts out heat close up this is ok, but if you want heat a small room try another type."
1,No Heat,This takes hours to heat up and the only thing that gets hot is the radiator itself - none of the air in my tiny living room was effected.
3,"Beware, Shorted","I received this product today and went to work putting it on the garage door. My doors are, tack on, 8 feet each. I unrolled the seal as I was tacking it on to the first door. When I got to the edge I cut it off. I moved to the second door and found out I had been shorted 5 inches of seal. re-measuring I found the seal was only 15 feet, 7 in. long! Not the 16 feet advertised.If the seal had been the proper length, I would have been delighted with it! works great on goes on easy. Nails with caps are proved for installation!When you receive it, the first thing you should do is to measure the seal, before doing anything else, to make sure you have the correct length!Watch out for this one!"
4,spanish language,"why this season five don't have spanish language?let me know, i have the others seasons but this i will not!juan carlos zambrano"
5,Best series ever!,"I love the humor in M*A*S*H, I watch this all the time with my dad and we have all the DVD sets, I want to get this one for him for Christmas, to everyone out there, this DVD set would make a great Christmas gift to any fan of M*A*S*H."
3,Wonder of the World is a Wonder,"If you're lookin for good, well thought out, arguments against the atheist world-view, this book is loaded with them. Varghese covers a lot of ground, here, and touches on almost every aspect of scientific and meta-scientific thought. In fact, one of my criticisms is that he may have tried to cover too much ground in one book. He almost could have used this material to write 3 books, here.The book is based on written discourse between Professor Madhava Mitra - a.k.a. the Guru - founder of the Sakshi Hermitage in the Himalyas and Joseph Levin - a.k.a. the Geek - a post-doctoral research assistant at MIT. Levin's father died and, in consoling him, Mitra uses the opportunity to show how Levin's world-view falls far short of giving a reasonable explanation of our experiences.I found myself getting lost in some of the logic but that didn't stop me from enjoying the book."
5,Stunningly clear and beautiful. Remarkable.,"I am reading this book right now. I could not wait to write a response- the first ""review"" I have ever wanted to write. This book is too good to be missed, if you have ever been fascinated by the universe. It is a book for everyone and informed enough for the most informed. Roy Varghese generously offers us a stunning work of intellectual and fully human attention. Please read THE WONDER OF THE WORLD. You will never be the same."
1,Big disappointment,"Since I have done my research on Christianity, just like Charles Templeton, I have too lost faith. This film does not answer any of my doubts. Just like all the other Christian presentations, no factual evidence are presented ,just the opinions ,personal feelings and Bible quotations.The video is not valued priced."
2,Where's the missing song?,"I am sick and tired of CD releases containing less songs than the album counterpart. If they couldn't fit the 2-record set onto 1 CD, then they should have just issued 2 CDs. (They could have put extra tracks to fill up the second CD.) Enough of this!"
1,Vendor is Terrible,The product is OK. It's the vendor & Amazon.com I have a problem with. The product is extension poles for a roof rake. I ordered this through Amazon.com. The problem is the rake was being supplied by one vendor & the poles by another. This is the way Amazon does it. The rake was not in stock so I cancelled the order with the vendor. That was no problem. I tried cancelling the order with the pole vendor but they would not cancel the order even though it took them over a week to ship them. Now I have extension poles to a roof rake I do not have.I will not do business with Amazon.com again!
5,A Visual Masterpiece,"If your child likes to look at art, this is the book to buy to introduce him or her to the story of the Exodus in the Bible. It will definitely capture their attention. Brian Wildsmith is a great illustrator with his rich colors and incredible detail. I bought a copy of this for our church's library and recommend it for any public or private library. It will surely become a classic."
4,These are great!,I bought these books because of my job as a relief teacher and these books are great because they are very comprehensive. They wil help to put lessons together quickly.
2,saemless panties,Advertising is false. There is a huge serged seam across the rear that feels like sandpaper.I hate for companies to mislead me. This is totally fraud in advertising. No wonder they have changed the name of the company to fool people. Now they use the Bali name.
5,Like meeting with a saint for coffee,"I have had the pleasure and privilege of attending Bible Study Fellowship for 9 years. It has been such a blessing in my life and has provided firm foundation for my understanding and knowledge of the Bible. So, when I received this book as a gift from a dear friend, I was very enthused to learn the history behind this organization. Reading of Miss Johnson's life experiences, in her own words, was like meeting regularly with a dear saint for coffee. I developed a habit of reading only a chapter or so a week so that I could consider the lesson that her various experiences could teach me. Love the time I spend with this book, how it clearly shows how God can work in our lives, and how to live out a faith in Him! This is a work that I will read repeatedly."
5,Created for Commitment,"Challenging, inspiring story of A Wetherill Johnson's life story and beginning of BSF. Everyone should read this one!"
1,Wright Door Hardware Doesn't Work,"I have purchased two Wright door closers now. Neither has worked. The first was bent and broken upon the first gust of wind we had. Not a hurricane, just a gust of wind. The replacement for the first was broken right out of the box. It was stuck in the hold open position and wouldn't close. Imagine that, a door closer that will not close. Not was I was expecting when I bought A DOOR CLOSER! Needless to say, I will never again buy anything manufactured by Wright."
3,It works almost as well as the 19 year old model I have on the back door.,"I was glad to be able to find this door closer on the internet and to be able to purchase it at a reasonable price. I installed it on the front screen door. This is a wrought iron door. The size was exactly exactly the same as the previous one so all the screws fit just right in the previously drilled holes. The problem is, no matter how you adjust it, it never fully closes the screen door to the latched position the first time you open it. The next time through the door it works perfectly. Now I notice it is not quite as big around as the 19 year old one it replaced so that might have something to do with it. The only reason I bought a new one was that the little detent that keeps the door propped open was worn out by people who thought they were doing a good thing by pulling the door closed, even though I had it propped open on purpose. I wonder if they are all like this now or just the one individual item that I received."
5,My 5 year old boy loves it!,My 5 year old lost his first tooth and I saved it on a ziplock bag. Then I realized that his first tooth needs to be well taken care of since I want to save it at least until he grows up. I purchased this product and I am very pleased.
5,Greatest horror I have read to date,"I was walking through a store one day looking for horror and I saw this book. I had never heard (or maybe slightly) of HP Lovecraft and now that I have read this book I am astounded. This is the BEST book in the horror section that I have read. I plan to expand a library of HP Lovecraft titles soon. GREAT BOOK, I recommend it to anyone."
2,Best Stories Poorly Reproduced,"Poorly rendered, bloodcurdling number of typos,misspellings etc. It looks like the editors re-typed the stories on a word processor and skipped proofing."
2,"Typos, only six stories?","It's hard to believe that a ""best of"" compilation would only contain six stories. The formatting looks sloppy and there are typos everywhere which makes me question the credibility of this source. I'm going to look for another book of HP Lovecraft, and I regret that I bought this one."
1,From what I can tell there are two books...,"One has a skull on the front and is really badly edited with six stories. It is published by CreateSpace, and I ordered it accidentally. The other from what I've heard is longer, and much better done. This is published by Del Ray, and many seem to have enjoyed it. Also it has a cover with a floating wall and some other cool spooky stuff. Both have the same name, and also seem to share the same reviews on amazon. I am not not sure about this, but I doubt the version I have is the one getting the great reviews. If I'm right amazon should probably do something to make them distinct so people don't buy this one on the good reviews of the other. Thank You."
4,Great read!,This is some great H.P. Lovecraft. I was very happy to receive this book. I like to read and H.P. Lovecraft wrote about great stuff.
5,Great fun for M.F.K. Fisher fans (and who isn't a fan?),"M.F.K.Fisher was one of America's best prose writers ever. Though known for her writings about food, it's insufficient to say she was a food writer. Her real subject was herself, her journeys through life and relationships, and her ability to render intensely personal experiences in some of the best writing I've ever had the pleasure to read.If you are a fan of her work, you will enjoy ""A Welcoming Life"", which has many, many fine photographs of Fisher and her companions and the places they travelled. It's enjoyable to actually have a face to match to her descriptions of ""Chexbres"" or ""Timmy"" (Dillwyn Parrish, her second husband) and others as well. The photographs, black and white, are beautifully printed in this book."
2,I would not recommend this product,"I didn't purchase this through amazon, but I would like to share my experience. I begin using this daily once a day. After three days I begin using it in the morning and before bedtime. After using it twice daily a rash appeared on my eyelids and on both sides of my mouth. The end results was my acne didn't go away but the pimples did dry up.I hope this will help you in your decision."
3,Looking for a Beginner's Book?,"This isn't it.It's clearly for a specific audience, the intermediate editor, especially one working on an indie film.For beginners or highly skilled editors moving over to FCP, buy the excellent and highly recommended Tom Wolsky book, Final Cut Pro2 Editing Workshop. Ignore the 2 in the title, it works just fine with FCP3"
3,"Good, but not great","This is a good Tom Petty album, but some of the same songs, with much more energy are found on Pack up the Plantation Live."
2,okay study book,"This question book is an okay review of subjects if you perfer a Q/A format way of learning. However, the question format and style of questions are not similar to the USMLE Step 3. There are few Negative questions (eg. all of the following except) in the USMLE Step 3 and at the most, there are 3 questions following a passage (In NMS, there can be up to 6-7 questions following a passage). I found the NMS review to be too detailed (like questions we see in Step 1 and 2- eg) indirect inguinal hernias are medial to what structure.....)I found the Kaplan Q book the most similar to the style and content of USMLE Step 3 (However, the passages in Kaplan tend to be very long and detailed). A good review book is Crush Step 3 as well. Good Luck!"
4,good cd,"if you like wu tang u should get this album. it has a lotta great cuts on it. i dont think its as good as the first wu chronicles though but it is good. my favorite cuts on this cd is hip hop fury, in trouble, above the clouds, and also nyc everything. but then again almost all the songs on this cd are good. i recommend it to any wu fan. cop this."
3,Not the Soundtracks From the Movies,"I bought this CD collection thinking it was the soundtrack music from the HP movies, but that is not the case. It is music from the Hollywood orchestra, and not directed by John Williams.The music is not the same, but it has interesting variations (for instance, ""Hagrid the Professor"").There are no Choral scores included (I really missed ""Double Trouble""). This collection is nice if you don't buy it expecting it to sound EXACTLY like the musical scores in the movies.I still listen to it even though I'm also buying the REAL soundtracks. I consider them much better.John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra have collaborated on movie scores together for about 20 years now, and I haven't found a better combination of talent."
1,<---- Digitally Reproduced! Dont Buy This!,"This is a digital reproduction of the wonderful music that John Williams composed. This company made this and stuck the title ""Harry Potter"" on it knowing well that people would buy it thinking it was a great deal for all three Harry Potter CDs."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I think saying this CD set is ""a piece of crap"" is a little harsh considering the description says clearly that this is a digital remix of the original soundtrack and does NOT claim to be the orchestral version conducted by John Williams. It's actually quite a nice piece of digital music considering the price: all 3 movie soundtracks for the price of 1 orchestral version. Honestly, in some places I forgot it was digital because it really sounded like orchestral quality.If you're expecting the full-orchestral-John-Williams-conducted version, then yes, you might be disappointed. Otherwise, take advantage of a surprisingly rich mix of digital music that may not be John Williams but gets the point across for a much lower price."
1,False Advertising & Pure Crap,"Don't buy this CD!!!!!! It's just bad midi approximations of the score!!!First off, I received this as a gift from my unsuspecting relatives, who thought they were getting a great deal. Bottom line: you get what you pay for. I don't know who ""Mask"" is who ""performed"" these tracks, but I've heard better orchestral sounds on days of our lives. And as to the previous comment about the CD being clearly marked as a ""digital remix,"" that's pure crap as well. It doesn't say this anywhere on the packaging. I don't know how they obtained the mechanical license and I don't know how on earth this CD was allowed to be distributed. I don't know what scares me more; the fact that this CD is allowed to be out on the market, or that people these days are so oblivious that they actually think this bad synth lives up to the live orchestral recording!!!It's borderline false advertising, definitely unethical, and simply pure crap. Shame on you whoever put this out. Shame on you."
4,aerosole shoes,i really liked the shoes...... would definetly consider buying another color .... not as comfortable a i would have expected but still very good
2,Not sized properly,I don't think this is a 8.5M. I've purchased many items of aerosoles and these were too tight in the toes. Usually a 8.5M fit me like a slipper. I don't wear them and am looking for a way to stretch them so they don't kill me toes....
4,NOT stacked heel,"I just received these today and here are my first impressions:They are NOT stacked heel.True to size.Good quality for the price.Heel isn't as high as described (size 8 1/2)If you have a high arch, you will want inserts for these pumps.I bought C/D (wide width) and tried them on late in the day, they seem like they will be very comfortable."
4,Not true to size. Color differs from picture.,"The shoes are very cute, the style is classic, and the heel height is just about as high as I can go in heels and still walk comfortably. However, there are two problems:1. I wear a true size 8. The shoes length is too long, with a huge gap at the back of the shoe, but a 7 1/2 cramped my toes. I added toe pads to make the shoes fit. The solution isn't perfect, especially since there is a loss of toe space, but they fit.2. I purchased these in ""Blue Fabric."" The blue is much darker than pictured above; it's more of a medium blue than and light blue. I was expecting a much lighter blue. Shoes looks more causal as though covered in denim fabric--hard to pull off at work for which the shoes were intended.Despite the above, I'm keeping and wearing the shoes."
4,Dean Spanley is a must watch,"Dean Spanley is cleverly written with brilliant acting from Peter O'Toole, Jeremy Northam, Brian Brown. Heartwarming, touching and delightfully humorous. Well done."
5,"The ultimate, distilled essence of the Beauty & Beast story","Starts out like your average Heroine of the Light vs. the Dark fantasy novel, but when the anti-hero appears the story will reach out and grab you by the throat and not let up until the end. So intense in places I thought my heart would stop. Warning: this is NOT your average romance. Get all four books before you start or you'll be risking your sanity."
5,Terrific!,"Great, great music that you can sing along too. Joyfully passes the time in traffic or at home relaxing. I received it on time and it was well-packaged. It was a great bargain and brought back many memories."
5,Every Song a Classic,"One need not be a ""parrot head"" to enjoy this CD. The range of styles on this album ranges from the up-tempo just-for-fun songs such as ""Cheeseburgers in Paradise"" and ""Volcano"" to the bitter sweet ballad of ""He went to Paris.""The only drawback of this CD is that it does not include my all-time favorite Buffett song, ""Chanson Pour Les Petits Enfants""But this is a keeper."
3,Robot Fun,"I assembled the Gobblebot with no trouble at all, and it rolls across my floor like a bat...However, the antenna ""switch"" does not work at all. Three members of the family have tried and failed to get this ""switch"" to turn the motor off. As long as the battery is in the holder and the wires are connected, the motor is on and the wheels turn. Bottom line: colorful though somewhat flimsy parts; clear and easy instructions; switch frustration; otherwise, fun to play with.I look forward to assembling my next bot."
1,Ultimate Frustration,"The parts are cheap, the models built are flimsy and the motor is flaky. After the 2nd robot, the motor no longer works. I bought this solely based on the quality products that DK produces. This is not one of them."
4,The Magnificent Seven Ride!,"This 1994 CD features James Sedares and The Phoenix Symphony conducting Elmer Bernstein's score for the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven, a Hollywood remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai(1954). Sedares and the Phoenix Symphony do an exuberant job conducting 70-80% of the score. We're also treated to a musical number from The Hallelujah Trail(1966) sung by the Arizona State University. This CD is worth every penny."
4,"Good for novice, average for serious comics fans","The author covers a lot of territory. However, it stays rather general, which is good if you are new to the topic. If you are a comics fan however, you probably already know at least half of the info presented in this book. The other half is interesting, but not captivating."
3,lena headey,"This DVD was ordered from ""Movie Mars"". Their service was prompt and the DVD was in excellent condition. When I attempt to play the DVD the caption ""wrong region"" displays, therefore I haven't watched the DVD.I blame myself for not being more observent.Paper work is clearly marked Region 2, and on the cover BBC DVD is displayed. Because of my own ignorance I would like to return the DVD at my expenseand pay shipping for a DVD that would play in my region."
3,Simple,This belt has a simple aesthetic. The metal buckle has edges that are sharper than I'd like and the rolling pin mechanism that holds the canvas in place requires a moderate grip strength between your thumb and forefinger. If you have a belly the buckle may press into uncomfortably when sitting down.
1,No!!!!,wat the hell is this??? it sucks man are u kiddin me. if u wanna see a good tribute listen to tribute to eminem the rappers aren't too bad they arn't exact but the best i heard. the slim shady ain't that bad but this cd sucks!! don't buy it unless u want to wast money
3,Okay for eleven...,"First off I have to say that Romeo is tight for actually making an album at eleven. Although that's a big accomplishment for anyone, his album compared to other rappers' just doesn't hold up. It's not just that his high voice can get to you but the lyrics are way to corny and wholesome. He talks about living a ""big man's life"" but then raps about his grades in school. I also have to say that Matthew, a reviewer on this album shouldn't be allowed to review anything. He is way to harsh on Romeo but gives the Crazy/Beautiful soundtrack 5 stars! What's up with that?"
2,The GHETTO BILL,"november 11, 2001when lil romeo came out lil bow wow was jaleastand that's why lil bow wow made the sign ghetto-girls but he wanting the sign to go ghetto boyslil bow wow thaink he the stuff but Idon't thainkhe the stuff he is the ghetto boy ghetto boys is sojaleast they don't no what to do but Im down with no limitand all of the girls that like lil bow wow they ghetto with him"
1,"""GARBAGE, GARBAGE, AND DID I SAY GARBAGE""!",This is the worst CD that I ever bought. There was no way he could get over Lil' Bow Wow with this b.s. I can't even tell you how sorry this CD is. It's just garbage.
5,One of the first and best remastered Bing Crosby compilations ever,"This compilation is notable for being one of the first and best remastered compilations of Bing's music ever released, as it was done by Steve Hoffman at MCA back in 1986, in the original mono from the first generation masters. Although many of his biggest hits are on the CD, there are some seldom reissued tracks such as "" I Kiss Your Hand, Madame,"" ""What's New?,"" ""(You Know It All) Smarty,"" ""Beyond The Reef,"" and ""Welcome to My Dreams"" to name a few, plus 1 song released on any format for the first time entitled ""The Ol' Spring Fever,"" and the previously unreleased in the US at the time this CD was compiled called ""You Are Too Beautiful,"" along with many of the heavily compiled tracks. Whether you are an audiophile looking for some of the best sounding Bing on CD, a diehard fan of his music, or a casual fan, this CD is a must purchase for the low price that Amazon Marketplace sellers sell it for."
1,Garrett's killing of The Kid is suspect!,"The simple fact that there are so many other facts about the killing of Billy The Kid besides Garrett's story makes me wonder if he really killed The Kid at all. I really think that Garrett simply wanted the reward money for himself (which he was denied) and to use this event to help him further his political career. Seems to me it did not work since everything he did afterwards seemed to fail for him. Truthfully, I think we will never find out the truth except that Garrett will be remembered as the man who killed The kid by those who believe Garrett's story. I for one as with many other Historians think that Garrett's story is not totally truthful."
5,Good Book for learning templates,This book seems to have everything you wanna know about templates from techniques to why you should or shouldn't do certain things.
2,"Ehh, you have a 50% chance of this dying within a month","I bought 2 of these for a summertime renovation project. They are quiet which was nice but within 1 month one of them died for no apparent reason. One is fine, works well to vent a full bath but with a 50/50 DOA ratio, I can't give this product a good rating."
4,Gekker is fabulous,"What a great showcase for the amazing sound of Chris Gekker and his trumpet. His playing is nothing short of breathtaking. My only wish is that he was the trumpet soloist on ""Mountains And Rivers Without End"" too. At any rate, this disc has great recordings of an extraordinary musician. Hovhaness's music is as magical and mystical as ever."
4,razor,my husband said it was a good razor but thought from other reviews that it would shave closer. liked it better than his Norelco
1,Poetry in name only,"This book is chock full o' sentimentalities and raw emotion. However, Mr. Fisher clearly lacks any poetic ability to go beyond unrefined emotion, lacks the magical touch that transforms words into Art. Thus, many of the poems in the thankfully very short book feature excessively repetitive ideas lacking in depth. If you're a serious student of poetry, don't read this, it will not fail to disappoint you."
4,good enough for the first time,I think the book is pretty well written for the ones with only exposure to basic abstract algebra.
5,da zane theory,"DIS IS A HOT ALBUM. NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST, BUT ITS CLOSE. HIS FLOW IS AS TIGHT AS EVER. AND HE IS STILL AS FUN AND EMOTIONAL AS BEFORE. IT SHOWS ON I.O.U. AND DO IT, DON'T STOP. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DIS ALBUM."
4,Not Bad,"I am not usually a fan of gore, supernatural, werewolves, etc. but I truly enjoyed this. I think the setting of the 1800s in the fort and woods works well. I think the relationship of the sisters is well developed and draws us into their world. The other characters are interesting too. The special effects are good despite the gore, and there really is a story here. I will probably watch this again."
2,Why Did So Many People Love This Film So Much?,"Okay,im gonna get straight to my tagline for this.The first original GINGER SNAPS is definitely the only good one off the trilogy.GINGER SNAPS BACK UNLEASED I thought was pretty weak and weird.GINGER SNAPS THE BEGINNING is just very odd and doesnt really make up with logic.Obviously this isnt Ginger and Bridgett from the other 2 films but they just happen to have the same name,look exactly the same,and bottom line its just a very odd approach to the series.I dont really understand why they would take the series this way.Its pretty bizarre.Other than that,the werewolves look the best in this one of the three films,and the storyline is pretty solid.I guess I would like this movie if I never saw the very first Ginger Snaps.I kinda like it,but in my opinion its not Ginger Snaps."
3,Gsb,This is one of the ginger snaps films i could have done without but it was alright. They could have put a but more imagination into it i think but who am i?
3,Definately worth a rental!!!,"I have seen all three Ginger Snaps movies, and I'd say this on ranks as #2 (the best one being the original, Ginger Snaps). The acting here is very good, as are the special effects. But more so, the ambiance and setting are excellent (the sets were well designed) and there is nothing about this film that appears phony or out of place. I'd definately recommend renting this one. If you have not seen any of the three, I would suggest, though, starting with the original."
2,Ravenous Part Deux,"I have this theory about sequels that I might have stolen from somewhere that I can't remember... and that is that usually with a trilogy either movies 1 and 2 are good and 3 sucks, or 1 and 3 are good and 2 sucks. An example of the first scenario would be Terminator, example of the second scenario would be Indiana Jones. Ginger Snaps Back, the third installment in the Gingerwolf franchise, puts this series in category 1.Not to say that this movie totally sucks. As far as indie horror goes, it's a fair effort and it has its moments. But at the end of the day, it winds up feeling like ""Ravenous"" with werewolves. There's even a Native American guy who spends a lot of time talking about the wendigo myth in this one. I deduct points for a lack of originality."
5,"Like the Camel Pose, with Butter","Having waited with bated breath for four and a half years for this release, I had to wait a couple of days to write a review. I had to let the excitement wear off so I'd be able to write something fair and objective.Well I don't know when that time will come. I've been listening for 4 days straight and I can't get un-excited about it. This is an incredible album that brilliantly displays all facets of Steve's personality. Billy Harvey couldn't have done a better job with production, it's neither over, nor under produced.While the entire album is excellent, the highlights for me are Friendly Fire, Who I Am, Lost Without You and Ten Chances.This is a wonderful album to sing along to or to have playing in the background.BUY IT NOW!!"
5,Poltz is mah Babies daddy!,"words cant express how truly wonderful this cd is, this man is the personification of what truly good music is supposed to be about, plus he's cool. ""Give you up for lent"" will have you swooning as the cover of TLC's ""Waterfalls"" will have you slow-jamminbuy this CD!buy it now!and while you on the net purchasing poltz products you also should check out w-w-w-dot.poltz.dot-c-o-m!theres gold in them there hills~"
1,Not for a Diabetic Cat,I bought this hoping perk up my CRF cat. He has kidney problems because he is diabetic. The base they are using to make this palatable is corn syrup and sucrose. Corn syrup is the 1st ingredient and sucrose is the 3rd. I wish they had listed that in the description. Now I am out this money. So if you are trying to control your cats blood sugar this not the item to buy. If you know of a vitamin appropriate for a cat with Chronic Renal Failure and Diabetes please put it in the comments on this review.
4,Good product,"My cats were lapping this up. The only problem I have is that it does have sugar in it, which would be a problem for diabetic cats."
2,Doesn't work with Viewsonic Pro8100,"Mount does not include screws that fit the Pro8100. Had to call company and they have to ship me the screws. Should not say ""universal"" when it's clearly not."
5,"Well written, sound advice without being ""preachy"".","This is a well written book that every Grad needs to read. It is ""to the point information"" on 100 subjects that eveyone who is starting out in the world will face. It is not a dissetaion to straighten out all of life's issues. It is short and sensible information that is Biblical based. It is enjoyable and very readable. The quotes from scripture and some of the greatest minds in history make the value of this book even more. I know that there are a lot of ""books for graduates"" out there, however this one is more than trite niceties and poems. I recommend this book for parents, youth workers, grads, and even teens who ""already know it all."" I found this book to be an excellant read. This one is not only on the gift list, it will be on my library shelf."
5,Little Einstein from Amazon (dvd),"I bought this for my grandson to watch. He is 3yr's old. When I pick him up from school it's first the Apple Juice then on goes Little Einstein. He loves the music and the way they present the learning part of it. I like it because it's not some dumb cartoon that is a waste of time, and there are a lot of them out there. That is another reason I keep coming back to Amazon. I know I can get what I want and know they will take care of any question I have."
5,Kill's hot review,"Nuthin but a Gangsta party vol 2 is awesome combining classics like nuthin but a G thang by Dr.Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. And snoop's Who am I(What's My name?)with new hits like hello by ice cube and snoop dogg by snoop dogg. plus kurupt,Daz,Nate Dogg,Master P,C-Murder and more defiantly buy this Album."
5,A Must Have,"This is great for Hannah Montana fans, my girls are 8yrs and 10yrs and they love it. You hardly see the older episodes of Hannah Montana. I have to admit this is one show they watch that I even like to watch with them. Great Episodes."
1,yawn-a-thon,"i read dis book when i done cannot sleep, mon. dis book so boring and dry, dis book a yawn-a-thon! and i liked de excerpt from he new book A Gesture Life dat i done read in Granta, mon. de characters zero engaging and de prose beyond-beyond bland and banal. don't go read dis book! you want read good book read book by Kazuo Ishiguro or William Boyd or Hanif Kureshi. dis book a sham! how it win big prize! only V.S. Naipaul write good book about immigantes and so."
2,Hum Drum and Ho Hum,"I hope the author is now over his psychological hangups because he could probably write a very nice book if he is. But this ""Native Speaker"" is a soggy loaf of white bread: a potentially good plot that's foiled, spoiled and soiled by lots of sad little culs de sac.You know right from the beginning the books is going to be boring when the protagonist, a Korean-American male, meets up with a Caucasian female at a cocktail party, and when they sneak off to kiss they both can't get into it because of the racial difference. Come on! If you're not turned on by someone, don't try putting out.Forget the kiss, forget the minor and major poignancies, forget this book. Read something truly exciting and multi-cultural, like ""Tailor of Panama"" by John le Carre. There's a plot that moves."
2,dull,"self-satisfied and smarmy, the prose style and artistic vision in no way deserves the attention this book has receive"
3,Still no Ha Jin,I liked this book although A Gesture Life is still the novel of Chang-Rae Lee I like the best.
4,Back in the Sleigh-dle Again,"Prolific. That was Gene Autry, it seems. His wife asked him to record ""Rudolph"", a promotional tune for the long-time but now-defunct Montgomery Ward department store. It went beyond a mere promo and ended up as a Christmas standard. Who knows how much money it's made. Gene could also write a tune now and then and not just ""Ridin' Down the Canyon"". He wrote some of these songs himself. It's worth having, believe me. And as for prolific, reviewer L. Bernabo (with the typo in his branding) couldn't tell you which song is the #3 most popular (after White Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer). Well, trust me, it's ""The Christmas Song"" written by the ""Velvet Fog"" Mel Torme and sung by Nat ""King"" Cole. It's been around like 50 years. You can find it easily enough. In the meantime, buy this one."
2,great for moms,"My mother asked me to purchase this for her and she loves it. It reminds her of being a kid in the fifties. However, be forewarned that played over and over it can be truly annoying."
4,Great sounding 6x9's,"These speakers are great, the tweeters ad quite a bit of high end to the back of my car while the 6x9 cone pounds a little, nothing like some good subs, but for a 6x9 pretty good. Only problem that I had were that they didn't have any slim mount versions and I don't have a lot of space behind the factory grills in my 01 Nissan Xterra but I took a chance with these since I love Polk, so I ended up with the tweets pushing on the grill a little. They fit but just barely, overall a great product, can't imagine what they'd sound like when I finally amp them."
5,All Polk Speaker System Sounds Fabulous!,"I've got these installed in my Suburban as part of an all Polk Audio set-up with a pair of 6.5"" components, a pair of 6.5"" 3-ways and a 12"" subwoofer. All are DB's and all are driven by a couple of Polk's digital amp's. I can not say enough about how great the system sounds. Clean, tight, extremely accurate and yes, loud."
5,A Classic...,"Well, when reading to your 2 and a half your old you don't usually start laughing out loud. This book made me do it not once, but 3 times.I've read a lot of kids books to my children - we don't have a TV - but George and Martha is one of the best ones. Hands down. It's a cross between Roald Dahl's children's books and David Sedaris' memoirs...My boys (both 8) favorite story in it is the Mirror one. When asked how many stars to give the book they said 10 when I gave them the choice between 1 and 5.My favorite's the one where George is gawking at Martha having a bath. I won't give the rest of it away...Am going to buy everything Marshall has written."
3,A review based on the needs of Japanese children,"This is Phillip Tolar. I think that the book is good, but the following should be adjusted:Repeating the same story 2 or more times on the CD, and the level of spoken English being used, which can not be satisfactorily explained to children age 4 and 5 in the Japanese culture, because of the amount of unknown to Japanese people that we use in English. I know the book says for ages 3-8, but I would have to really think this book is for ages 7-8 in America Only. For example: "" Martha was very fond of making split pea soup,"" was one of the sentences in the 1st story. It means Martha likes split pea soup a lot, but when I am training young children to read, they do not have to learn all of the derivatives of the word ""like."" This is just one example for you. I think Amazon or the maker of the book should research and create an age scale for readers that are not native English speakers. About Amazons service I can only say terrifc! Thank you."
3,It's Allright,This music book was very helpful in that the piano pieces could easily be played by a non-maestro person. It is very nice to be able to sing at the same time that you are playing.
1,Are you kidding me?,"Honestly, I can't believe this DVD exists. I realize that the fine folks behind saturday night live are trying to squeeze as much money out of the old episodes as they can, but the best of Chris Kattan? That's like selling a dvd on the subject of ""most enjoyable colonics"" or ""best stds to pick up while vacationing in the far east.""At his best, chris kattan was a barely adequate contributer to a few good sketches (that other cast members carried), at his worst he was ""someone please gouge my eyes out of my head and bite my ears off so I don't have to be subjected to this lack of funny material"" bad. Just for the record, he was at his worst far far FAR more often than he was at his best.So what's next, SNL brain trust? Best of that worthless fat kid from Good Burger? I sure hope so."
3,BEWARE OF BACKLIGHT!,"This was a fantastic PDA in the beginning. I had evolved from the Visor, to the Edge to the Treo. The main reason I jumped from the Edge to the Treo is because the backlight went out on the Edge, so I thought I would upgrade to a color screen.I loved it until the backlight on the Treo went out! It was completely useless without it. I was able to get it replaced with a new unit, but only because I bought an extended warranty and had to raise a fuss with customer service.Other than the backlight issues, the unit is wonderful. I find that the keys are a little too close together to make the keyboard funtional. RecoEcho is a great hack to download to write on the screen. If the backlight holds up on the new unit, I would highly recommend it. If not, I will abandon Handspring for good."
3,Still no Mac OS X support (July 2002),"The Treo 90 is a great little organizer. The size is perfect and the weight is feather-like.But there is *still* no OS X support at the time of writing. My old Visor Edge at least works with Palm's OS X software but there are dire warnings against using it at Handspring.com.A disapointment to say the least.So, back it goes. Do yourself a favor if you're an OS X user and check Handspring's Web site before you buy."
2,What Is The Fuss About???,"Boi..church folk will say any project sounds good. This album was disappointed. If you want Lamar Campbell's best, pick up ""I Need Your Spirit"" - if you can find it. This one might have Daniel Witherspoon producing it, but it's a long way from being sensational. And Lamar's vocals are irritating at times. Songs are quite cheesy if you ask me. EMI Gospel did the right thing to not focus on this project too much for promotions."
3,Nifty OK for back seats.,"Bought this liner with the Nifty front liners for my Tacoma. This one fit but there was no opening on the passenger side for the back seat ""tray."" Sent them back and purchased the Husky liners for the rear seats. Some trimming required but not a big deal."
1,Wrong product description,"Beware; although Amazon describes this item as over-the-calf, the product is actually a mid-calf length sock."
3,Good material for the novice but dated,"Unfortunately, books like this are quickly dated, as this one is.It gives a good overview of how to produce a website, including project management, for novices. All nicely presented, but in black and white without much material on graphic design or more up-to-date ways to display and interact with data.I hope the authors consider writing a new version."
1,Surely not intended for split-level home expansions!,"Was using old Total Home Deluxe 3.0 by Broderbund, worked well, but crashed too often as not designed for XP..So 'upgraded' to 3D-HAD-5.0 (then 5.1), and (as several reviewers noted) not compatible w/ anything..OK, start from scratch..after figuring out a highly counter intuitive UI, found that the only way to design a split-level home (which i am expanding) was to explicitly enter floor and ceiling offsets from ground level..did that , but windows placed on 1st level appear near floor level!..tech support said that is b/c it 'thinks' its the same level and make sure no walls from 2nd floor are touching walls from first floor..Excuse me?!? it is a split-level and of course the walls touch! (but even when i separated the walls, the windows still were on the ground)..also 3d rendering/rotating was excruciatingly slow (and i have 512MB ram . 2ghz pentium4)"
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!,"This program is the BIGGEST disappointment. It wasn't working when I first installed it. I had to upgrade it to version 5.1 and disable all hardware acceleration just to make it work. Yes, it is easy to use and it is quite ergonomical. I thought it would speed up the project that I was doing in autocad. My mistake. Do not waste your time with it. After completing 90% of the project this program created a glitch within the file and now refuses to draw walls. Obviously, the technical support was useless. I tried to convert my data into DXF (Autocad format) and VRML (a common www 3d format). Both conversions failed. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
1,Not an Upgrade,My wife has been a user of 3D Home Architect since version 2 and has developed numerous house plans for clients and contractors. She knows how it works and has found technics for the software that allow for savings in time and provide clients with realistic and valuable drawings. VERSION 5 IS NOT AN UPGRADE OF THE OLD PROGRAM!!! IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. A major change or new supplier was licensed to provide this NEW version and it is totally incompatible with the old and worthless to anyone who has experience with the old program. If you are like us and want to keep up with the latest editions and maintain old designs DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM.
5,A Blend of traditional and eccletic blues !,"This is so far one of the best recent blues album ive heard. This guy incorporates a wide range of instruments in is songs but it keeps the blues essence (Banjo, Trumpets...). The Blues on the Banjo is astonishing ! The Lonely traveler Is gone is touchy. Also the lyrics are sometimes funny and sometimes serious. How can someone not love this album ?"
4,"Good camera, some minor quirks","I got this as a gift over a year ago. Works great and I'm very happy with it. However, on a few occasions, the lens failed to open and I had to wait a while for it to start working again. As with some digital cameras, the most annoying feature is the slight delay in taking pictures. This is very frustrating when you're trying to capture a baby's actions! The mini movie feature is great and so is the quality of the photos. This is a good camera overall."
3,Overall good camera,"The good:Ultra compact, feature rich(I love the subject tracking AF), good picture, easy menu.The bad:weak flash, barrel distortion at the wide angle side.This camera takes good pictures under bright light. But the flash is very weak(effictive within about 6 feet), and it often produce over exposed spots on reflective surface, so if it's not absolutely necessary, turn it off, the fast lens can handle most low light situation(you can turn to manul mode and adjust the aperture to the largest).The barrel distortion at the wide angle is very obvious. I got bended floor lamp, it's much worse than my film SLR(Olympus IS-30). The default turn-on focus setting is the widest angle, so remember move it a little bit to the tele, kind of anoying.Overall satisfied with this camera, subject tracking AF is cute. Takes very detailed pictures, white balance works very good. And it's easy to manipulate pictures with bundled software."
1,like biting the hand where he ate,"who is Mel Torme???? aaaaaa a jazz singer, but in Italy 90% of people do not know who he is! Judy Garland???? ohhhh YES THE LEGEND.. miss SHOW BIZZ ecc...Dear Mel .. a little jealousy? why did not you tell these ores things when Judy was alive? true or not I loathe people who speculate on the death of other persons! Judy is the Legend... Torme is one of many!"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this cd for the seven-song ""Frostiana"" segment. That such beautiful music could be recorded with so little passion and audial clarity is very disappointing. ""Choose Something Like a Star"" lacks the song's earnestness. It drags like a dirge more applicable to the work of Emily Dickinson than to that of Robert Frost. I have heard these songs presented more professionally by high school choirs. For anyone who has an interest in hearing ""Frostiana,"" it would be best not to listen to this recording."
3,Review of Portable Cassette Player,"This product is a little scratchy on the sound, but I only use it for books on tape, so it is fine for that. The radio works well. You can't beat it for the price."
5,Laughing out loud!,Bought this crazy book on impulse and never have I laughed so much. But it is also crammed with useful info... I suspect the reason why this guy Chris O'Kalan wants to stay anon is because many of the characters in his (her?) anecdotes are probably real. I'm not a teacher by the way but I do have young children and the stuff about drugs in the book will hopefully give them a clear understanding of the problems without making them paranoid. I'm dipping into the book not reading it through and constantly find myself laughing out loud. A gem.
1,SHE CLAIMS TO BE THE BOMB!,"She proclaimed herself the motor of the speedboat of POP music in the 80's, what?!, she say she got more style than Madonna and Janet Jackson, what'...well Miss Jody if you were all that you will still have a career instead of recording for independent labels. Your debut album simply sounds dated, and is not classy, whoever had the idea of the HASTA LA VISTA BABY, offended the whole latino comunity, and is so classyless...no no, and by the way, you didn't sold more than 1 million copies, please return the GRAMMY."
2,Dreadful writing,"I got only about 6 pages into this book. I'll not be able to criticize the story because I couldn't stomach the lousy writing. This is the first of Hynd's work I've encountered, and will be the last. If I was teaching a English fiction writing class, he'd have to repeat it to get a passing grade."
5,A Symphonic Rarity,"The symphony is a work wriiten by Rozsa when he was 23. Although it was a promising symphony from a young composer, Rozsa could not find anyone who would tackle a large scale work lasting 50 minutes. The symphony was put away for 60 years and revised for this recording when the parts were found (minus the scherzo). It is a tuneful work, well put together and memorable. The symphony is coupled the charming ""Vinter's Daughter"" variations. This disc is a good introduction to Miklos Rozsa's concert hall music."
2,Not nearly as easy to use as they'd like you to think!,"After using 3D Home Architecht 4.0; I upgraded to this professional version. Not only are the two softwares TOTALLY different, but some very helpful functions in the older, for simple 4.0 are not offered in the newer 5.0 version.Sure - its very powerful; but if you can't tell how long your walls are, what good is it?"
1,Waste of time and money,I have been a user since the original version. This program is a poor attempt at what a true CAD program has to offer.Not to mention the software is full of ads and useless online yet required down loads. I own a new Dell with 512k and the latest video drivers and I cant open any 3D files. Wait for a compatibility patch or some other fix.
3,Perfect for kids!,"Nothing much here to say, except kids love this stuff! Ive built houses with my dad and loved construction since I was a kid so I can relate to the tools and projects.Overall its a pretty decent movie, and a nice change of pace from watching Spongebob repeatedly... ;( It has enough of an educational aspect that I think its worth it. My nephew seems to enjoy it and hes learning the names of tools and the idea of what they are used for so its good for that purpose."
3,Helpful information,"The book did a good job of answering the question ""Do Muslims and Christians worship the same God?"". It also had a comparsion of the lifestyles of Muhammad and Jesus. The book was well documented."
1,WHAT? Who Published this junk,"Simply put, this kindergarden level book is simply not worth what I recently deposited in my bathroom."
1,"Hatered , what happend to love your naighbor.",I don't think this author knows anything about Islam. I think he had a bad childhood.Hatered and racism is all I seem to read.Rights were given to women 1400 years ago. Islam condems terrorism.We are taught to respect Christians and Jews to the full extant.The author did not mention this in his book.The poor guy needs to study Islam carefully.I swear to you he knows nothing about Islam.The religion of Peace.If you hate Islam you'll love this book. Read about Islam from a person who is not racist.He did not mantion how much muslims love Jesus.
1,A book filled with Hate and Dishonesty,Dr. Morey have to do more research before he writes a book about a major subject. He made mistakes in his book that i found astoundingly horrible. He made remarks about something which he doesn't even know. Reading his book describes exactly what kind of disgusting personality he has and hatred he contains for Muslims. All the sources he uses in his book are baised in one way or the other. I hope people do some good research before they write books.
1,check the person writing reviews,These two reviews about the book has an e-mail address of rmorrey. Such a coincedence that the auther's lastname and the initials are the same.. I haven't read the book. But I have no intentions reading it after this pathetic move by its author.
3,Where's the end?,"This felt like half a story to me. I kept looking for more pages, surely it didn't just end there! I love Clements' books, they are some of my favorites, but this resolution is too quick and easy."
5,Funniest cd in my collection!Had the tape; had to get cd for home!,"This is one of the best of the best at his best! If you don't know Ray Stevens' humor, you must get this. It is hilarious."
1,Junk,"broken fan,...New one, broken fan.....New one, Broken fan... Hmm do I see pattern here? Back to ThermaCell which works AND I don't have to worry about how long the fan will keep going"
3,Reviewed by a retired Engineer,"I received this Lentek Model MM30, called Bite Shield yesterday afternoon and at around 4:30 PM I tested this thing in my back yard which a hiding place for some Asian Tiger mosquitos in Houston, Texas. These pesky mosquitos are known to bite during daytime. Within 5 minutes while testing in a light breeze of around 4 to 5 MPH one adult came by with three other smaller ones, despite of this Lentek running by my side. I swatted the adult and two smaller ones by my palm when they started feeding on my left arm, but the other juvenile got away. This morning, at 8:15 AM I tested it again in calm air and was surprised that one or two mosquitos will not land on my test arm. I tested again this afternoon before sunset with calm air, and got bitten while this Lentek was running on my belt. I came back inside my home scratching my left elbow. I would just give this Lentek MM30 a 3-star rating at this place where these Asian Tiger mosquitos are plentiful."
1,It doesn't work at all.,I bought two of this Bite Shield. There is a small fan to blow out some smell of chemical. The mosquito doesn't care about the smell. I was surrounded by mosquitoes and got bite the same as without this product. There is almost no wind. It is really disappointed.
4,Works Well,"Bought this and it seems to be working well. I used to have all these small bites on my forearms but they have all disappeared since I started using this repellent.The con to this device is that the small fan that blows the aroma is so weak, the only way to hear it even working is to hold it up to your ear. I have it in front of my window fan that blows most of the aroma throughout the room, so that is probably why it is working as well as it is."
5,She's my age ;-D,"Yep, I was around her age during the 80's, Heck, she may have also graduated from highschool in 93'. Yes Like Debbie Gibson, Tiffany is a special single. I also fell in love with Martika aswell. And in 1996, discovered for myself, The Corrs, and started listening to them. This music today, some of it can't touch the lengends like Tiffany. Also check out Tiffany's Greatest Hits album..."
1,People Please Wake Up!,"This is complete and total garbage. It WAS when I first heard it in the late 80's as a pimple faced dorky teenager, and it STILL IS NOW. This high school dropout had one good song (like thousands of others in the 80's) and people want to say how great this ALBUM is? She butchered a Beatles song and put some other mindless dribble to complete the project and then acted cute and innocent for years while milking morons out of their money in purchasing this [garbage]. Now she is in [a magazine], trying to re-invent her 15 minutes of fame that she didn't deserve the first time. ..."
5,Godhead Nothingness (There True Goth Sound),"I love this CD. Of cource I am a huge fan of Godhead, but this definetly shows there true gothic side. Yet it is still mixed with there powerfull way of an electronic/techno sound. The small songs such as ""ravencrow"" and ""childlike"" are very interesting, and I love each one of them. They make you wonder what the true meanings of these songs actually are. I would have to say that this CD is one of there most original CD's. This CD was rare, then in was re-released on a different record label. If you are a true ghead fan or just starting out, I would still recomend buying thid powerfull CD."
3,"Fuel Goes Soft, Sort Of...","Fuel's new single returns to familiar ""In My Hands"" territory, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, its just nothing new. That being said, there are some very good power ballads on this album, including ""Falls on Me"", ""Million Miles"", and ""Most of All."" But Fuel really shimmers when they get back to their mealodic rock roots, which can be heard in such previous tracks as ""Last Time"" and ""Shimmer."" ""Won't Back Down"" is the only track that captures the intensity that Natural Selection seems to be lacking. Simply put, Natural Selection does not demonstrate the range that Fuel has as a band, and some tracks often blend together. Overall though, this is a very solid album from a band that you really have to see in concert to truly appriciate. How this album's material will hold up in concert has yet to be seen."
3,pull my finger,"I think that the cover looks like someone about to get a finger pulled. I feel like someone took poetry classes before writing the cd. Im really mixed about this. I didnt expect this cd to have such a poor recording. I like the music, but it could have been a less reflective of relationships. I dont know if its just me but the cd sounds to bland. What takes them so long to release a record? I gave it three stars because they are moving in a different direction. I guess im not ready for it. This cd reminds me of a cd I have listened to already. This is not a mass market type cd. I like that about this group. They dont sell out."
1,Natrual selection should have killed this off!,Yeah thats right. THat's how bad it is. IF i were you id buy an older fuel album not this dungball. No wonder its only 9.99
5,"Awesome CD, Best Yet From Fuel","Ohh my, I had heard a couple songs from this cd before it came out, and when I bought it today and listened to it, I was blown away on how good it is. Every song on the cd is VERY GOOD. Definitely a good buy. Don't pass it up. These guys have talent, and they actually sing, not scream!!!"
1,Lily of the desert In Aloe Vera Plastic Bottle,"I ordered this product with the understanding that it came in a glassbottle. What I received is a plastic bottle. Hard to imaginewhy a company promoting good health with Aloe Vera would package this inplastic exposing us to toxins, and adding one more bottle that willnever break down, leaving a permanent scar of the planet.I urge anyone reading this review to Never buy this productand to contact the manufacture as I have and let them knowif they are distributing in plastic we will not buy it."
4,Good Read with lots of Pasadena in it.,"It was a very long book but if you take the time to finish it you will be glad to see that it ends with warm fuzzies for the main charcter, who at times seems too good to be true."
1,It's a Very FOOLISH Muppet Christmas Movie- Do not watch it.,"We are a family who really enjoy the Muppets. This is by far the most disappointing production we have ever seen. Don't waste your time, this movie is not fit for a family Christmas movie night. The sexual innuendos are dead giveaways that this movie was not target to children. There are other things that make you wonder why they thought this would be appropriate for children (such as Animal engaging in party-style binge drinking). This was absolutely disappointing. We spent $4.99 to rent it and stopped it mid-way. There is a reason that this movie has mainly 1 star ratings. I hope they producers get the point."
3,Involved Parent!,"The movie wasn't spectacular, but it was passable Christmas Muppet fair. However, the reviewer who was offended by the Propecia joke is even more stupid than the film was. Propecia is a hair loss medicine NOT a prostate medicine... I repeat... NOT a prostate medicine. God Lord, when you shut off that movie after 30 minutes did your children hit you over the head with your DVD Player? Yours is one of the most dim-witted reviews I've read in some time. It's not fine art but it's certainly NOT offensive! I'd let my kids watch it any time they pleased."
2,Not as good as other movies,"I did not enjoy this movie nearly as much as the other muppet movies. I would suggest purchasing ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" instead."
5,A Very Merry Treat For All Ages!,"Perhaps the most delightful romp since the first three Muppet films, It's A Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie is certain to become a holiday tradition for families everywhere. A big hit on NBC, this film has many great moments of both ironic humor and warmth. It follows Kermit through his efforts to save the Muppet Theater from the angry Rachel Bitterman. Along the way, he and his fuzzy pals engage in the usual Muppet antics and discover the importance of their frienship.In the tradition of Muppet films, special treats come in the form of guest stars. This movie includes Whoopie Goldberg, William H. Macy, Carson Daly, Kelly Ripa, David Arquette and the scene-stealing Joan Cusack who has more than her share of delightful comic turns.You won't be disappointed with this very merry DVD. Two flippers up!"
4,Great for those who grew up on the Muppets,"I was a child when the muppet show was still new every week. My family watched every episode together. Now, over 20 years later, I understand why my parents enjoyed the show as much as I did. There were many adult and topical jokes / skits in the orignal Muppet Show (and the first Muppet Movie). I find this christmas special in many ways an excellent tribute to those (hilarious yet occasionally bawdy) days. Of course, with Jim Henson's son taking over for him, some elements will never be the same. Modern references to pop culture (like Mission Impossible and Kelly Ripa) may eventually make this movie too dated after another decade or so - but that was true with the orignal muppet show as well - and perhaps these modern references will allow your children to view the muppets as the ""cool"" icons my generation saw."
1,"Beer Bongs, Phone Sex, Cage Dancing Muppets????????","""It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"" had beer bongs, phone sex, an uncaring 'god', cage dancing and other material inappropriate for children. No, it was not subtle -- it was blatantly clear. We LOVE the Muppets! We would have hoped a muppet movie would be safe!"
1,just sad,"Unlike some other reviewers, I thought what sexual content there was would simply sail over the heads of the those they think it is unapropriate for. I give it one star because It's lame. The jokes aren't funny and even the few moments of manic muppet action go on for too long for anyone to care.Not that anything muppet related has been incredibly subtle in it's morals, but the ending of this movie is just dumb. Really, amazingly dumb."
3,"Cute, but lackluster","The movie is cute and delivers a few funny moments, but it's obvious it was made for TV, and geared more towards kids than adults - unlike the Muppet films of yore, which could be enjoyed by adults and kids equally. It's just lacking that real spark that made 'A Muppet Christmas Carol' a true classic. Still a nice watch though.My only real complaint is about the actual disc itself, which looks poorly manufactured with a really cheap-looking label on it. So far it's worked okay, but I have my doubts about how long it will last."
1,This book is not about the tango,"I can only confirm that this book is not about the tango but mostly about the personality of Marina Palmer. Given that the target group is that of TANGO lovers, not Marina Palmer fans, this book feels like a bait-and-switch.What it shows clearly, however, is that whatever you do and wherever you go, you will always take yourself along. Being professionally frustrated and having a low self-esteem makes one see the outer world in negative colors and attract wrong kind of people.I am sure that if Marina Palmer were to enter the world of, say, basket-weaving or table tennis she would find them just as wicked and disillusioning as her world of Argentine tango turned out to be."
2,something better,"If you liked this book, have I got a deal for you. Please, please get a copy of C.Terry Warner's: Bonds That Make Us Free and savor every word. The Holy Man might get you started but Terry Warner gives the instructional manual. Prepare to be changed forever."
1,Totally disppointed,"¡Totally disappointed! I bought this book thinking I could learn to do some Bowen therapy, but... after the title page you can read ""It is not intended for use un practice except by qualified accredited practitioners who have undergone practice training in the Bowen method"".And on page 14: ""This book is designed as resource for patients..."" and on page 77 ""Please note that this is not a complete manual on how to perform the Bowen Method"".I read the Chapter 12 ""The Bowen Move"": At the beginning you can read ""Probably the most fundamental component of Bowen Therapy is the move itself"". Well, I couldn't understand this chapter. To me is unclear and confusing.So, if you want to learn Bowen Therapy do not waste your money buying this book. And if you are a patient, you don't have to buy the book ¡It's cheaper to ask the Practitioner!"
1,Smaller than original,"This basket is not as deep as the original, so i never used it. It's still in the box it came in."
4,Fun Read for Lunar Base Advocates,"Moon Rush provies a useful argument for lunar resouce explotation in the years ahead. The book provides some useful review of the utility of space object minerals but to a lesser degree than Mining the Sky by John Lewis. Nonetheless, Dennis Wingo does make the significant point: ""we return to th moon for the reasons that make economic sense, not just for science or for some intangibles."" The later part of the Wingo book provides some interesting overviews of lunar base implementation ideas. Overall, the book was a fun, light read."
5,PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS ALBUM,I have not been able to get this CD anywhere. You've got to use your clout to get this album back in production. I can't believe that this lable is no longer available. There is too much demand and the fans will not be denied!
2,to thick,"the protector is to thick, the smallest touch on a corner and it will peel of. I don't recommend it. There are protectors with 2 layer of foil to remove , they are better, more flexible."
3,Very limited speed control,"The roller spins pretty much the same speed whether you dial it down to ""slow"" or ""fast"". That said, it feels darn good on the feet."
1,Revised comments,"Purchased this product as a christmas gift for a friend, and she really did not like the way it felt to use it. Initially posted about that and my frustration with the vendor nor responding to multiple contacts. The vendor has since been in touch and indicated the lack of response was due to post-holiday time off. He gave me the info I needed to make the return and said they would refund with no restocking charge. The product is on its way to them and I await the final resolution, which I expect to be positive."
4,Well worth the cost.,"If you like crosswords that are fun to do without resorting to stacks of reference materials, then this book is for you. Lots and lots of clever puzzels you can complete in an hour or so. One word of advice : take the first 70 or so puzzels and give them to someone just beginning to do crosswords as I found them too easy to enjoy. The other 200+ puzzels were great. These crosswords are not the brain twisters from the New York Times which require experience, determination, and research to complete. These puzzels are challenging without being frustrating. Give it a try."
1,WHERE THE HELL IS IT?,"The book of crossword puzzles was intende as a Christmas gift for my wife. She enjoys such puzzles tremendously. Bought & paid for, the book of puzzles never arrived. Perhaps it will show up in time for next Christmas --- or maybe Kwanza."
3,Lacks good bass,"I recently purchased Panasonic receiver model SA HE100K mainly because it was top rated by Consumer Reports and listed as a BestBuy. I am using it strictly for audio (tapes, CDs, vinyl). I was disappointed in its lack of bass reserve even with the bass control turned all the way up. My very old cheap Technics receiver, which I thought I was going to improve upon, actually produces a richer sound with more bass. I was told by Panasonic that these receivers are now made mainly for home theatre systems and possibly the regular stero sound is sacrificed because of this. Too bad Consumer Reports didn't make any mention of this. The problem was solved by buying an equalizer, which really does improve the fullness of the sound, but resulted in making the operation of the controls somewhat more confusing. I feel I should have gotten the sound I was expecting with such a top rated product without having to make this additional investment."
5,A True Classic,Exemplifies this genre and time period. Still a classic. Strong album with many good tunes.
4,It was better than I expected,"When I recieved this cd I expected to hear a Jim Brickman wannabe, but to my surprise, this young man actually has a sound of his own, or at least one that has been born from the intertwining influence of other artists. I even hear a classical influence in many of the songs. There were a few that I didn't care for, but that's to be expected from any cd. I give it a 4 out of 5 and would recommend it to people who like piano music, but perhaps would like to listen to something a little more deep and complex than John Tesh or Jim Brickman. I don't know what the previous fellow, Thomas, was talking about. I worked in the recording industry for years, and let me say that I've heard a lot of garbage, and this is definitely not worthy of such an insult."
3,Doesn't Age Well .. but A Few Good Songs,"I really enjoyed the show when it first came out in 1987 and listened to this cd often. Since then, however, the show has aged ... and not particularly well.Mr. Webber's scores for ""Phantom Of The Opera"", ""Evita"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" hold up better.There are a few good tracks, however, on this ""concept"" recording:Starlight Express (very catchy tune)Engine Of LoveThere's Me (personal favorite)Only YouI wish they had released a Broadway cast recording (the London one is available as a double disc), but this is a fine substitute."
4,"You don""t have to pay too much for quality","The better bass that you can ever imagine for my Explorer 8300HDC Scientific Atlanta DVR.5 stars for the price that I paid .Capable to send 5.1 to be converted in 7.1 through my Onkyo TX SR605 in Dolby pro logic IIxExtra Tip:If you love the blacks in High Definition, combine this cable with a component cable PURE/Av by Belkin"
5,Rule breaker,"When someone buys an item that is inexpensive and they then have a negative experience the line ""you get what you pay for"" is thrown out. However, what do you say when you buy something that is a fraction the cost yet works just as well as the top name brands?I got this cable very quickly from the seller and was a bit worried at first after seeing some people were complaining about the cables not snapping into place. When I plugged this cable in though it fit snugly into place and the sound quality is on par with all others.Now any time I have a friend, co-worker, or family member talking about upgrading their home theater system I make sure to mention the great deal I got here.A very loud 5/5"
3,headsets what?,the company took good care of me. The head set had a nice ear piece that was very comfortable to ware.
2,Comfortable design. Poorly engineered electronics.,"I talk on my land line for approximately 8 hours per day, as I work from home. This headset is my third. I like the design and the high quality materials used to produce this one, but I am very disappointed with the sound quality. It is possible that the poor quality is from my portable phone or the phone line itself, but my friend said there was a distinct ""buzzing sound when I used it versus when I spoke without it. Sound quality for the heaqdset user is probably the loundest and the clearest of the headsets I have used. In all, I would think that someone out there would make a headset that actually had good audio for both the speaker and the listener. Strange that no one seems to have accomplished this."
1,Simply not enough,Are there REALLY 176 sheets per roll? Seems more like 17.6 sheets in my house. I feel as though I am changing the roll every day or two. The quality is fine and all. I just don't want to change the roll so often.
4,GREAT upgrade for Toyota 4Runner,"Product arrived as expected. Install was a little more problematic. 6.5 woofers needed slight modification to install in factory position. Ended up epoxying the tweeters onto the factory bracket in order to fit them with factory trim without interference. Crossover board was extracted from case and bolted to door with least interference with door panel. Factory wiring was utilized. Sound wise, noticeable improvement over factory speakers (which weren't too bad). Can't wait for the woofers to break-in. VERY please with this purchase."
1,Not worth a penny,"I expected a bit more from Sebastian Bach. I bought this DVD right after I saw him in PA...great performance, and I was glad to shell out $20 so I could watch him again in my living room. Little did I know that what is on the DVD has been shot with a home-video camera (very badly, in fact). The sound and video footage is so bad, bootlegger would be embarrassed to sell this. Don't waste your money."
5,HE IS SO FUNNY!!!!,ALL I CAN SAY IS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS THE BEST!!!!! NO ONE ELSE COMES CLOSE TO HIS TALENT!!!!
4,GENEROUS ZOOM-RANGE; ALLURING DESIGN,"Minolta's Dimage 7i is expensive, but its design is inviting. One of its most outstanding qualities is its generous zoom-range. At 28-200mm, it is a novelty in this digicam category: a masterpiece with excellent wide-angle and focussing system. The listed 5.24 megapixels buck, which effectively yields a 4.95 megapixels resolution proved capable. Its quality images testified to this fact. Minolta's styling choice ensured that Dimage 7i has well-positioned accessories and control buttons. But the main setback is that the high-speed 7fps burst falters each time I set the camera at its maximum resolution.Overall, this is a fine photo tool whose image quality is superior to that of its immediate predecessor, the Dimage 7."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The Red Shoes Poster Movie German 11x17 Anton Walbrook Moira Shearer Marius Goring Leonide MassineI am very disappointed with this poster. While the paper the poster is printed on is 11 x 17 the actual poster is not. While I understand the poster size is ""approximate"", there is a thick white border around it, especially on the top and bottom. It takes up about 3"" in diameter of the poster. The product picture is very deceiving.While the shipping was fast, the seller did not notify Amazon that they had shipped it, therefore I could not tell my postman to leave it by my door. I had to go to the post office to retrieve it.I will look into returning this product as the frame I have is too large for the actual poster and I dont want to show the tacky white border."
4,strong record here,"Initially I gave this a 3 star rating because honestly, the record doesn't make a good first impression. The cover art looks shoddy and cheaply thrown together (especially compared to earlier releases). The sonic quality of the recording suffers from being ""Pro-Tooled"". This record really deserved a better recording.The good news is after repeated listening it gets better and better. Some real highlights are ""Way Round"", ""Octo-Realm/Ketamine Sun"", ""Serum"", and ""Devolute"". The playing is quite strong, and Mr. Smith's ranting continues to capture my attention.Highly Recommended for old and new Fall fans alike."
1,BORING!,"I have read many adventure/hiking/Alaskan/Arctic non-fiction books. This had to be the most boring book I've read so far. It was not engaging and the writing style was just ""YAWN"". I couldn't even finish it! There are much better books like this out there!! Don't waste your time."
5,Great Duo,This is a composite of great song selections! Shows both their talent and light-hearted/comedic side. One of the all-time great country artist duos.
4,Day of Atonement,"I enjoyed the book, as I do all of Faye Kellerman's books, but I thought this book dragged on a little too long and left me hanging at the end as to what happened to the young man who was the subject of the book."
3,NOT BAD,"I live in atlanta, GA, where many famous passion singers live. I wanted to go there, sherman, TX for one day 03 but i didn't have time. workaholic.. well, i go to 7:22, a Christian single gathering.. louis giglio leads gives message and i liked Passion so i bought this Cd. I liked 4 songs so far.. but i think it gets better everyday. track 1, 2(kinda like the drum thing here) and 6(Sing to the king, which i like the most) and 13 (not to us). i was hoping to hear more Chris Tomlin and Charlie Hall and Matt redman and David Crowder.. well, they were in it but i just did not get much out of it (yet) as it did for me from ""our love is loud-passion"" cd. But all this comments are based on music (listening-wise), spiritual-wise, i like all of them. great and lovely. superb! hope this CD will encourage many people to come to Christ!"
1,Extremely poor quality. Multiple pages damaged.,Many of the pages in this book were not readable due to the poor print quality. Some of them were even printed on perforated paper. Not happy at all with the purchase.
4,Movie,"Very funny , the picture play good , movie did not jump are cut off. Love it and will buy from this person again ."
1,Don't waist your money!!!,"I love Sommore, but I must be honest this not funny. Compared to comics like,Eddie Griffin and Kevin Hart stand up this is weak. I was really waiting to laugh and so disappointed. I wanted to send back my DVD , which I purchased from Amazon. I was waiting for the punchline and it was never delivered. It is average but not funny."
4,nice and easy,This book is very easy to understand and gives the reader a fundamental view of the chinese language. I just wish the book was a little longer. The author though really makes it easy and clear.
4,Track List,Conway TwittyBorderlineSide 11. Julia2. Lonely Town3. I Want To Know You Before We Make Love4. Borderline5. Not Enough Love To Go `RoundSide 26. Snake Boots7. I'm For Awhile8. Fifteen To Forty-Five9. Everybody Needs A Hero10. That's My Job
3,An all right buy if you're an Enterprise fan,"Enterprise: By the Book is a good buy for any Enterprise fan; however, it does have its downfalls. The book focuses too much on the RPG (role playing game) then it does the actual conflict. The book includes log entries from Archer as the conflict they are involved in peaks and descends. These log entries make Archer seem impatient and incompetent for a Star Fleet Captain, much less of the Enterprise. Although this is the beginning of their trip it's supposed to be after Broken Bow, maybe a couple months later, his relationship with T'Pol is terrible. Maybe it's because we're further in the Enterprise season and we know that his relationship with her gets better, but the relationship he has between T'Pol is like a brother and sister: always fighting. This book is an easy read and is worth your time if you are an Enterprise fan."
1,"PETRA peters out..awful, trite, 33 min CD","Didn't think this would be so bad, but it is. Poorly produced and the drums and bass sound like machines. The lyrics are trite and the sales (so far) have been dismil. The album didn't even chart on Billboard."
3,works ok,not as well as I had hoped for compared to the paste which works wonders on brass...the paste works 10x better and the stainless polish really doesnt work as well as other products i use.
4,"Defining book, and classic Sci Fi","I read this book when it first came out, and was the first Greg Bear book I had read. As such, it holds a special place in my mind and heart. I enjoyed reading (and re-reading) this book. It is a classic escapist Science Fiction, hard to put down, and totally entertaining.Read it for yourself, but get your own copy. :-)"
2,Awful,"While this book is moderately well-written, this is clearly the work of the immature writer. The story does not progress in a meaningful way, the plot is confused and explanations unclear, and the story ultimately becomes boring."
3,The cup of Our Life,"The book is structured for a long course in looking deep inside our soul. I found most of the suggestions very useful and exactly the type of information I needed for group exercises. I used a few for just my use and encourage anyone with the Big Question ""Why am I here?"" to ponder this process. Joyce Rupp is a deep introspective person with more than enough spirituality to share with the world."
3,Sanyo 24 Bottle Wine Cooler,The wine cooler works well. Temperature is maintained plus/minus 2 degrees. Only problem is cooler arrived with two cosmetic dents in the rear side. Styrofoam packaging material was broken into pieces. I felt it would be too much hassle to try to return item (was the shipper or the transportation company at fault?).
3,What are blocks on Robots?,"I can't figure out what 'blocks' are in the game. If I could I think I would like it more. Also, I wish more than 1 player could play it at a time so I could play with my friends."
3,"Good, but be warned....","I have read this novel and the 3 other books in the series. I loved the first 3 and most of the fourth, but the ending completely ruined it. If you don't mind bad endings, then you're ok, but I feel that everyone deserves to be warned that the end of the series makes absolutely no sense before they choose to get started with the first book. Your choice."
5,Another Country Classic,"Okay folks, stop dogging Reba. Just because she can outsing and outsell everyone else in country (and pop) music doesn't mean you have to personally attack her on the Internet! This is a fantastic album, tracking her progress from the beginning of her association with MCA Records. Beginning in 1984 with ""Just A Little Love"", Reba slowly climbed her way to the top of MCA Records and has stayed there becoming it's best selling artist. That's over all females, males, and groups. So THERE! Great Job QUEEN REBA!"
1,just too silly,"I'm adding my rating here to help balance out the overall high current rating for this movie. I agree with the reviewers here that find this a very poor film, except I rated it a one star instead of two. It is just too silly for my taste. I have not seen the MST 3000 movie noted in some other reviews, but I can imagine that this movie is ripe for making fun of as MST 3000 does so well."
2,Colors vary,"I was sent different colors than I ordered, not worth the hassle of returning it, but still when you order one color combination and are sent another its very frustrating."
2,A workout putting labtop in bag,"This bag is very stylish and cute with a tough side. It's made of rough sturdy material on the outside and it has the safe bubbles in the pocket to protect your labtop. HOWEVER, like a previous reviewer stated, the handles are rough and overtime DO NOT get worn in. It takes me literally 15 minutes to put my 13"" macbook into the bag. I have to tug, pull and push! And even after getting it inside it doesn't fit all the way in. I've opened the bag all the way (zippers down on both sides), yet the the damn labtop does not slide in AT ALL. By the end of getting my labtop in loosely I just want to throw the bag across the room.If you care more about style or you have a netbook or you don't mind wasting sweat, 15 minutes of time and frustration then this bag is good for you. Otherwise don't get it."
3,Great design but...,"Pros:Nice ascetics.Cons:The 50 watt bulb is way too bright. It would need a much longer arm. I have it sitting on top of my computer tower on my desk and it is still too bright. I tried a 20 watt bulb and that is too dim. Looking for a 35 watt, but hard to find. The MR-16 bulbs have a beam that is too concentrated for a desk lamp at such close range."
1,So many patterns but none to make!,"I honestly thought that out of 100 hats, I would be able to find quite a few to knit and crochet. How wrong I was. Obviously I expected some novelty hats, that is par for the course with the amount of patterns featured, what I hadn't expected was that there were going to be so few really nice hats. The children's hats are mainly novelty and make the kids look daft. The adults hats are either overly fancy or just plain ridiculous. I would have liked to have seen a few really practical plain patterns that could be adapted by the knitter/crocheter. I have abandoned this book, and have had to buy not one but two more books to find any nice patterns. On the plus side, they are well photographed, the patterns are easy to follow and the layout is great. Very disappointed overall."
1,Vendor is dishonest,"ASIN Blue Moves. I ordered the double CD of Elton John's ""Blue Moves."" New! Received single CD with cracked case.I've never received a reply to my email from vendor.Unsure if I'll be using Amazon in the future for any purchases if this vendor continues to be recommended.F. Jones"
5,The Cristeros Rebellion,"The Cristeros movement was an essential part of the Mexican Revolution, my family are very interested in the Mexican Revolution."
1,Bell Witch,Thought this was a movie not a documemtary. I read a book on this and it was more informantive.
4,Best of.,"What to think about a Best Of album ? It's a good way for the fans to buy an extract of a band's career on CD, giving them the choice not to have to play their old vinyls when they want to listen to classics such as ""L'Elite"", ""M.Comedy"" or ""Fireball""...It's also a good occasion for the non fans to discover a mythical band of the French rock scene. And in accordance of what songs the auditor likes on this CD, maybe he would like to know more and buy the original album...What more normal for a band to do its promotion ? Of course, the eternal grumpy people will criticize the absence of some tracks, the release of two different versions of ""Antisocial"", the opportunism of releasing this LP just after ""Europe et Haines"", the fact to put an AC/DC cover ( ""Problem Child/Live Wire"" ) on a TRUST best of...Let's the bad mind people talk and listen to the CD to make your own opinion, and discover that there's some of the best songs of the band on it. Isn't it the goal of a Best Of album ?"
3,Good Pitcher,"Could be a great pitcher, but the inside is brushed ss so it's hard to keep clean. Otherwise, we'll made, etc., etc."
3,Too expensive,The product itself works great. The price is another story. $42 NOT for the whole filter assembly but JUST the filter replacement? That's nuts!!!!!!!! I'm going elsewhere.
4,liked it,"I liked how you can change from Rodney to his robot companion during play after you get the parts for him. I liked that you can talk to the other robots, some robots are evil. My favorite level was the level where you run around the city trying to get blueprints. In the levels where you are after the level where you get your companion, you get to try new moves."
4,TOM in Manassas,"This is a nice real wood plant stand, but the finish is not the greatest. It needed a paste waxing to get an acceptable look and feel to it."
3,Pretty good item for the price.,"This product is actually hard wood. No cheap particle board. When put together it seems pretty stable. The one I receive also looks good. There were no flaws in the finish and it was packaged well. However, it is not 100% symmetrical. It can wobble a tad and items sitting on the top shelf wobble too."
3,I especially liked the 2 Instrumental songs on it.,"The wordy music was OK, but the OUTATIME orchestra in tracks three and Six were amazing."
2,Buy it for 2 tracks only.,"This CD is no more than a couple of forgettable 80's songs, a fake Johnny B. Goode, 2 tracks by a band you've never heard of and ONLY 2 tracks of Alan Silvestri's score. The Back To The Future Theme by the Outatime Orchestra and the Back To The Future Overture. These are not actually direct tracks from the film either but arranged especially for the CD. Every single track from the score is missing and why Silvestri NEVER released, what is undoubtedly, his most popular score onto CD in it's entirety is beyond me. So far the fans have had to make do with bootleg versions but hopefully he will see to it that this and his original score for Predator make it to soundtrack CD sometime."
4,Worth the money,"If this is the Kyle and Susan Webb instructional tapes, then it's worth purchasing - great value. You get a whole bunch of moves for the price. They are very good teachers. Not the most stylized or fluid dancers, mind you, but they really teach you the steps. And they seem pleasant enough, without pretension. It would be easier if they put all of the moves of a style (east coast for example) on the same tape, rather than separating tapes by their level of difficulty. The music is annoying but catchy (I hate that). We like this tape much better than Teresa Mason's stuff. Warning, the jitterbug stuff is really two-step. However, the clearly-taught east coast swing makes it worth the price of the tape."
5,Outstanding! Why had I not heard of Gustavo Romero before?,"I bought this CD immediately after hearing Romero play an all-Chopin recital at the beautiful Sunset Center in Carmel (Feb 2010). I was astounded! I'd heard almost all the Chopin selections he played (many of which are also on this CD), but I'd never heard them played with such intimate nuance and delicacy, while at the same time offering virtuoso-pyrotechnics when called for. It was a simply brilliant and inspiring performance. I heard things in these Chopin pieces I had never noticed before. After getting this CD, I was very pleased to find it provides the same close-listening rewards I experienced at the recital. I agree with the other Amazon reviewer who said... ""Gustavo Romero must surely be one of the great underrated Chopin performers of our time."" I just checked out his web site [it's his name dot com] and find that this is regrettably the only Chopin CD he has produced. I recommend buying it!"
2,Too many skits are missing...,"Since this is not a complete set, I'm going to send it back to Fox. It's a sad, sad situation when skits that made the show famous are removed. There is at least one skit missing per episode and now I'm afraid they will be lost forever. One of my favorites of all time is gone - ""Chrystal Waters""."
3,Hated it.............Just tape it on BET and save over $30!!,"We got some great heavy weights such as all the Wanda skits, Homey The Clown kindergarden substutute, Home Alone Again with Michael Jackson, all The Men on Films, Hey Mon, Prince: Butt Out Jeans, all the Funky Finger Production skits (""He hasn't called me....BAM!!), Lashawn (""Why come they runnin' round like they saw a special at K'Mart""), and the sexy fly girls Lisa and the old J Lo. What really dissappointed me was all the cut outs such as my personal favorite Michael Jacksons' Black & White"" (I'm a virgin and I'm 33"" - lol). I paid $30 for this dvd and half the episodes were cut off (I do remember the LL Cool J and Paula Abdoul). BET now has In Livin' Color reruns and they do have all the skits originally aired from FOX without cuts. Save your money and tape the shows from there! They do not cut out many funny sketches as much as the next season on DVD so watch out for that too."
4,Question about a bit,Does anyone know if the 3rd Season DVD's include the bit titled Sam and Samantha Kinison?
2,It is just alright,I bought this item to put across my driveway so balls are stopped before they can get in the street. I have grass on either side but not flat. This was impossible to get to stay up. I found this item not great although a good idea. I ended up using it in my backyard up against the porch so balls do not go under the portch. That is is working fine for. I would not reccomend this product for protecting shrubs or plants or stopping balls unless the area is completely flat. ALthough I have not tried since my yard is not
1,this is a joke right???,"i saw these guys open up for sevendust and i thought they were kidding me.i figured the real band would come on stage and start playing.nope.instead i had to suffer through the enigma that was bobaflex-nearly 30 minutes of suffering and awful offbeat rapping and ""hey,ha's"" from every freaking member of the band.they were so sexually oriented with each other it oculd make you sick.the guitarists made random faces the whole show that made no sense and i coudlnt follow te music at all.just awful.and plus they introduced each song saying ""this is a song about not being able to get hard after doing cocaine"" or ""this is a song about alien invaders.""the cd is worse than imaginable with horrible rapping and uninspiring rhythms and riffs.avoid this and if they are coming to you live skip their set or take a strong drink."
4,Great Inexpensive Lavalier,"Great lavalier, and good price, like the fact that it has 20 ft cord and that the sound is decent for relatively inexpensive lavalier. Good Brand and received quick from Amazon. If you need a decent lavalier for small video shoots this is the one for you."
5,Great Mic!,I purchased 2 identical lapel mics to use in video recording. I can plug them right into my camera and have plenty of length on the cord to stand in position for the recording and have the camera far enough away to get my shot. The sound is clear and I have yet to pick up any outside noise. Highly recommend this product!
1,Not a happy videographer,"Length:: 0:23 MinsI purchased this mic back in April and didn't use it much, though I think I remember it working OK. I've had it in storage for pretty much 6 months. I recently wanted to record some video with a lavalier mic, and this is what I get. I've tried several different batteries and have attempted plugging the mic into a recorder instead of having it plugged into the camera. As you might guess, the quality doesn't get any better. I'm in the midst of scrambling to find a new mic now. Thanks for nothing Audio-Technica."
4,Very Good for the money,"I was shocked with the audio quality of this mic... I was not expecting much because of the cost, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is nicely constructed (metal) and comes with a nice clip. The only slight downside is that there was some noise in audio, that I think was caused by the long cord picking up interference with my lights or something else. All and all, a very good mic."
4,Great Mic but poor windscreen,"This mic is awesome! But the windscreen easy falls off, I guess I will need to glue or tape it next time. But so far only use it indoors but will probably start using it instead of my VHF wireless mic as the sound is so much better, and it has 20 ft cord so this can work walking with someone as well. I'm going to buy a second one to mic me, the interviewer, and I plug both monos into a RS adapter and it outputs in two channel stereo with balanced sound by both mics for $24 each, no need for mixers to adjust varying volume!"
3,"That'll do, pig, that'll do...",It's not the greatest and can cause a nasty bit of noise and hum but for the price it's a easy enough lav and s/n to work with.
4,ENLIGHTENTAINMENT,A most enjoyable read. Jed has a sense of humour and some very good insights to lend on the search for enlightenment. Could be complete fiction but who cares? Highly recommended.I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta
2,missing tracks,"This cd that I received has tracks 6-12 missing, no music at all on these tracks. I have contacted the seller and am awaiting a response, cd has fairly large scratch on it also,this may be the problem.Have contacted the seller, (cd bought used)and they cannot remedy the situation they say. Seller was goodwill in New Jersey."
2,"Sole was comfy, upper had a pressure point though","The look of these and the comfort of the sole were great. They gave plenty of room to my wide feet. The upper however dug into the top of my foot and was extremely uncomfortable. It was simply a bad design. Just one point of the whole upper pulled down as you walked forward, almost as if you had a small rope holding it down. What I had to do was put thick moleskin underneath at the back of the upper, and I had to take a razor and slice the edges at the base on both sides of the upper, this allowed the upper a little more movement so it didn't cut in so badly. I would have been a lot happier after having to go through all this if the thongs were only about $10."
4,fantastic music and lyrics,"I saw a production of Big River at a local theatre and absolutely loved it! I remember a couple of songs from when it first came out and that Roger Miller had penned the songs, but didn't think much about until I saw the play.The next day I purchased the cd and it has become one of my favorites. The ballad songs are so well thought out and not overly sentimental. The melodies are great.The actor/singers were phenomenal. I can't believe it took me this long to discover this little gem.Some of the songs were a little corny and colloquial, but I pass them by and listen to the good stuff.l would recommend it to a select audience of people who like broadway musicals, or just if they are interested in some good melodies and lyrics."
5,Simply the Best,"I saw this Musical for the first time on broadway went I was maybe 4 or 5, when it first came out.... and on the way out of the theater I was singing most of the songs already.... Rodger Miller was an amazing song writer.... This is a great recording, and my family's favorite Musical... A MUST HAVE...."
5,AWESOME!,This CD is the best Broadway production of all time. I recently had the opportunity of performing Huck in a community/high school production. Roger Miller has done a remarkable job with Twain's wonderful novel.
5,Excellent Choice,"I recently saw this performed by a local community Theatre. The songs were great and the story around it is great too. Try the ""macarena"" to Arkansas. It works great!!!"
5,Absolutely Inspired,"I never had the opportunity to see this on the stage, but yet this CD ranks among my favorites. Most everyone is familiar with the story, so not seeing the production is no hinderance to enjoying the tunes.Big River is a phenomenal effort, and I would be hard pressed to think of anything much better to spend an hour of someone's ""free time"" listening to.This would be a great ""gateway CD"" to get friends who are not interested in musicals to perk up their ears."
5,Just wondering,"This isn't a review, but a fact finding mission. I just ordered the CD and have read other people's comments. Can anyone tell me why this play is rarily, or never performed? There always is a reason. How many main characters are there, not including the town folks or chorus? If a person wanted to perform this, and wanted to assure that 50 of his closest friends would be on stage, would this be possible, or would it look like he was trying to fill up the stage with people? I'll do some digging on Google in the mean time.Thanks!"
4,Roger Miller can be herd in every song!,"This is a wonderful C.D. for anyone that enjoys Roger Miller. Having just seen the play, I ordered the C.D. right away. Every time I listen to it, I enjoy it more. ""River in the Rain"" is a favorite, but each song is done in the Roger Miller style. If you have seen the play, I'm sure you will want the C.D."
5,Outstanding value,If you are serious about competition obedience this book should be a required read. It was a great help for me when I started to show my first dog. It points out all the little things that can make the difference between a qualifying and a non-qualifying score. If this book was 5 times more expensive it would still be worth every dime.
4,Elegant and feel good jazz.,"I had the privilege of attending a Ramsey Lewis concert a few months ago and purchased this CD because I so enjoyed his performance. I love his covers of pop, R&B and gospel songs. Live or recorded, his sound is always elegant, minimalist and straight forward. Now I know why my Dad had so many of his LP's in his collection."
1,Down To Earth,"I continue to be amazed that among the new and re-mastered CD's of Ramsey Lewis, none contains the big hit ""Down To Earth"". Even the CD ""Down To Earth"" has excluded this great tune from the tracks. Anyone know where I can get a copy of that particular song?"
4,King of the Hill - The Complete Fourth Season,"As expected season 4 is great, even better than the previous seasons, a must for any dvd collector!"
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"It was a hard cover dvd, that was not specified on the page. Not what I thought i was getting. Fast shipping."
4,It works.,"I bought this as my regular sized bathroom tub drain broke (I couldn't afford to repair it immediately). The size was larger than what I wanted. But I was able to bend it to make the pouch fit the drain hole. But my alteration made the center portion too deep that it hit the bottom of the drain. So I had to push the center portion slghtly up (making an inverse pouch) and then it sat well on the hole. There is almost no space between this strainer and the tub floor but even then a few hair strands manage to pass through the gap. But luckily they get stuck with the wire mesh of this strainer. I don't think any hair can really manage to pass through everything. Even if it happens it's negligible. It's more than a couple of months now since I put this, but it has not rusted yet."
4,Well made and as described,"Not much to say about this, its a good size and well made. It does the job of filtering food and debris from going down the plug hole."
4,Better than the basket strainers,"I got tired of the usual basket style sink drainer. It clogged easily, didn't close well and it got scummy. So I picked up one of these to use for straining food, etc. I also purchased one of theseInSinkErator STP-PL Plastic Sink Stopper, Blackto stop up the sink for filling with water. I'm much happier with this setup. The mesh strainer needs to be cleaned every time you get food bits in it or the food dries and clogs the mesh and then it's a pain to clean. This does a reasonably good job stopping food. I clean this strainer by whacking it against the side of my kitchen trash can. That gets 95% of the gunk out. If you need additional cleaning, an old tooth brush works well. Then wash with soap and water and voila, drop it back into the sink! I'd give this 4.5 stars."
4,It Does an Adequate Job,"While this strainer does a good job of keeping stuff from going down the drain, it does get a bit rusty after a while."
2,Good introductory book,Basically a book for newbies in the field who wish to know how a laser works and the different types of lasers available in the market. I recommend it to anyone who only wishes to scratch the surface on this field.
3,"good score, bad CD","While watching the terrific movie this score comes from, I was very positively impressed by the work Nicholas Hooper has done: it works extremely well within the context of the movie, which, after all, is the ONLY job a score is required to get done.However, when I got the CD and listened to it, I was VERY disappointed with it. This has got to be THE most poorly sequenced score CD I have ever heard. The CD has absolutely no dramatic flow, but what's worse is that much of the best music seems to have been left off, so that you can't even make a particularly good self-sequenced album out of it.There are still a few good tracks here -- the ""Dumbledore's Army"" sequences, at least, are fairly well represented -- so hardcore score collectors will enjoy having it. For most everybody else, it's an enormous letdown.Here's hoping that someday, when the series is complete, we'll get nice, complete presentations of all seven scores. It's sorely needed in this movie's case."
5,the best,This is by far the best Jerry Jeff album ever made. A great mix of ballads and texas country.
3,"Book is full of detail, but duller than dirt","This book is good source material. Only experts in Jewish history should read it. At times, the book is hard to follow and can leave you confused. I do recommend it for research material though. I read this book in Religion 301- Early Jewish history to 1492: Expulsion from Spain."
4,Celtic Keyboards is a pleasure to listen to,This CD is a smart purchase for anyone who likes classical music or who likes Celtic music. Many of the pieces are not available elsewhere and the performances are very well done. Highly recommended.
5,I recommend it to everyone and her mother,"It was not what I expected and yet included everything I needed. No matter what your relationship with your mother was like or what you hoped it would be like, there is something in this book for everyone. Tears wrapped in laughter. And vice versa. A fast and fascinating read. I couldn't put it down and once I finished it, I started again. I recommend it to everyone and their mothers."
4,Best-sounding headphones for the price,"These are the best-sounding headphones I've ever come across for the price! They don't sound too tinny or have too much midrange like most cheap headphones. However, they're not built to last. Parts can break, and the thin plastic coating over the ear pads disintegrates into flakes after a few years. I've owned three or more pair of these over the last ten years or so."
3,Memoir of John Lennon by former employee,"If you consider the source and the inherently self-serving nature of books like this, you will find some valuable information here on the last years of John Lennon's life. Green's central contention is that Lennon's withdrawal from public view until just before his death was due to a severe form of writer's block and not any desire to be a ""househusband,"" which sounds plausible enough. The chapter on Paul McCartney's pot bust in Japan has some instructive information, and Green's general tone is moderate and free from now-it-can-be-told sensationalism in the Albert Goldman manner."
3,exposing the house-husband myth,"Inside information on the last 5 years of John Lennon's life from the perspective of Yoko Ono's tarot card reader. The years that John referred to as his househusband period, was actually a time of lethargy, apathy, & songwriter's block. The Lennons employed too many servants-including a nanny- to necessitate a househusband.Green documents John's descent into depression, sometimes bordering on psychosis, culminating in a 15-month period of self-imposed solitude in his Dakota apartment bedroom. Yoko copes with John's hermeticism by throwing herself into the business of making money for the family by acting as John's Apple representative, and through a number of unusual investments-including organic farming and the purchase of an ancient sarcophagus."
4,"Yep, it's true.","Reading this book is like reading the manual for just about any corporation with more than 20 people. It doesn't matter where you go, you will run into a lot of what you will find in this book. It certainly doesn't hurt to be prepared."
5,Great Birthday gift for friends niece,I purchased this with gift wrapping from Amazon and with a Happy Birthday Message on it. My friend was really happy that I got this for his niece and that I'm gonna start a collection of them for her. Shipping was fast and no damage. Really happy with what I had picked out in choosing this gift.
3,Insane. Wonderful. Terrible.,"This is a truly bizarre record. 'Viva Ultra' is totally, deeply magisterial. 'More Brother Rides' is a pile of tosh. 'Pushkin' is... well, 'Pushkin' is out of control, really.Most of the lyrics don't work so well in this setting; it's a testament to Oldham's musical ability that the words of his early work occasionally show up narrow and trashy in so heavily standardised a setting. The man writes and performs songs; he does not write and sell them. And this record shows why.I can't listen to it all the way through without wanting to skip something or other, and I expect that's how it'll stay: a curiosity."
4,"dare i say, cute?","somehow this release is very endearing. the richer production takes away from the barebones feel of days in the wake, etc., and it's in a way more effective, i think because it feels less pretentious, which is not to say ingenuine necessarily. calling this dude a genius is kind of like calling conor oberst the next dylan, but he is certainly very talented and a good wordsmith."
3,Good book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but the condition it arrived in was a little worse than I had expected. It did ship quickly, and I am happy with the transaction overall."
4,Ice crusher,It works good. The first one broke. The replacemet has not broken.Would recommend it to anybody.
2,Lasted about a week...,"After using for a week, a large piece of the plastic broke from inside the crusher. Very disappointed."
2,Lasted a month. The plastic broke.,"I had high hopes. It worked alright, but would be a challenge for an elderly person to crank it.The suction function only worked properly for a few weeks ( I used this item daily) then it was a hassle to keep it in place. The worst part, of course, was that the inside of the cap is of plastic, and the blades are metal. Well the plastic ""grid"" or ""teeth"" inside of the bin broke off, making this useless. If the entire cap were metal, and the suction were better designed it would be great. As it is currently designed and manufactured it is only OK if you are planning to use it infrequently."
3,Bag of ice and a hammer is better than this,"What were these guys thinking? The machine crushes ice, right? Ice melts into water, right? Wouldn't you have used stainless steel screws that don't rust to hold this together?The screws are rusting and vacuum seal works sporadically. I'm cranking the handle and the conatiner is slipping around the counter. This is seriously cutting into my drinking time.The ice crush is good, but I would have preferred to have larger chunks of ice that don't dissolve as fast."
1,The WORST -- do NOT buy,"I would give this ZERO stars if Amazon would allow that.I purchased an older version of this ice-crusher ten years ago. It worked perfectly, except that most metal parts were NOT stainless -- eventually ALL the metal parts were rusting (not merely the screws, as another reviewer describes).So I bought a new one. In less than a month of light use, the main crusher mechanism broke, and ALL the metal parts were rusting.Also, this new one is far inferior to the 10-year-old crusher. In those 10 years, many metal parts have been replaced by plastic. And the plastic parts are now much thinner.This product should be removed from the market.AVOID THIS THING!!"
2,Broke After Only A Few Uses!,"I would not recommend this product. I had it for only about a month and a big piece broke off where the blades are. It was also rusting around the screws, thus putting rust on the ice. . I was VERY disappointed with this product. Returned it."
4,great realistic love story,this movie was very well written and acted. a true example that we should be defined by more than our nationalities
4,Old story well and originally told,"A love affair between an Israeli man and Palestinian woman is obviously going to run into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. That fact could have made this a very trite film. The director and actors, apparently using improvised dialogue, keep this film fresh and original. The acting is very good.It is also refreshingly short at about an hour and a half. I have come to suspect that any movie over 2 hours is the result of poor editing.While it has nothing to do with the quality of the film I do get tired of all of the smoking that goes on in these foreign films. Will they ever break with this 1940's Bogartian cliche?"
4,Good.,"Good movie if you have a taste for middle eastern. Artistic with beautiful actors, leisurely pace. Not the very best but pretty decent for mainstream middle eastern movie."
2,What can I say,"Although this album was the most anticipated album for Sizzla of that year, it failed to bring to the table what Sizzla is known for, ENERGY. This album sounds and presented like it was forced off the production line. A couple of good songs but nothing that I have come to expect from this man. Worth a listen, but you won't be missing too much if you don't add it to your reggae collection"
5,Keeps getting better.,"If you buy this album thinking it will sound like Strange Pleasures, you are in for a surprise, a pleasant surprise. Men should take note from ""Feel Like A King."" Jimmie shows why he keeps the girls screaming.But that's just the begining. Once again Jimmie goes for that in your living room or basement or garage sound and the results are even better than those of his first album. This is raw music and showcases Vaughans talent as one of the best guitar players around. What you hear is how he plays, no sound effects, no gimmicks, less is more style. Every guitar player should have this album."
2,"Good To The Film, Not To The Ears Sadly","Star Trek IV is among one of the finest Star Trek movies of them all, combining its quirky and somewhat memorable humour...however Trek movies usually provide top-notch scores...and sadly The Voyage Home falls flat on its back here.Some scores for example The Motion Picture, being as old a movie as it is...the score by Goldsmith has not ages at all, nor has Horners The Wrath of Khan score.The 1980's is ever present in ST:IV, and while what sounds good in the movie, it does not upon listening to it solo.Music As Heard in Movie: *** / *****Music As Heard On CD: ** / *****"
5,Wonderful Teaching Book,"I have just begun to piece by hand after having a poor attempt several years ago. When I read that Jenny hand pieces all her quilts, I thought ""There must be something I'm not doing right"" because she is the 'Quilt Queen' in my estimation. I have found the book to be a clear, well thought out approach to handquilting and misses no detail of explanation.I have just finished hand piecing a large Queen size quilt and am now quilting it. I took her advice and began carrying a small bag with quilting pieces, needle and thread with me and have been amazed at the amount of time I spend quilting in ""lost moments!""I used to dread getting the sewing machine out because I always felt so stressed to GET IT DONE! Now I can relax and find the same time of enjoyment in piecing as I have always found in quilting.Excellent book."
4,They work,"You can tell they're quite flimsy as you remove them from their box, but they do the job. Everything works as intended."
1,Doesn't work with Wahl AC Trimmer despite Amazon listed compatibility,"Despite being a recommended addition to the Wahl AC Trimmer, these are incompatible with the Wahl AC Trimmer (ASIN # B000UZFQBS). After repeated attempts to contact Wahl technical support, there appears to be no compatible attachable guide combs for the Wahl AC Trimmer.Wahl Professional 8040 Ac Trimmer Precision Corded Trimmer"
1,Does not fit horse clippers,"I bought these combs after Googling ""Horse+clippers+combs."" I landed on a page with all kinds of horse paraphernalia and ordered the combs. They may fit Wahl people clippers, but not Wahl horse clippers. I paid more for shipping than the cost of the combs, and ended up giving them to a barber."
4,Fits,"Hard to say much about clipper attachments, but this is a nice selection of sizes. While the plastic seems lighter than those being replaced, I'm sure they will last just as long with care."
2,"C'MON, WHAT IS THIS???","ok, i've been a fan of kumbia kings for a while now, and i honestly have to say that this is one of the worst cd's i've ever heard!! there were only 2 songs worth listening to, and they are:track 1: sabes a chocolatetrack 10: insomnio (mano a mano remix)another one that came close, but just didn't cut it was track 12: mi gente (king of banda mix). i think a.b. and cruz tried way too hard with this album. the albums before and the ones after this were 10,000 times better! my favorite still remains ""shhh!""and as vico c says:""Que si me caigo, que si me levanto y vuelvo a caer.Lo más que importa es levantarse y no dejarse vencer""(from the song, ""se te apago el bling, bling)"
2,What Happened?!?,"I love the Kumbia Kings, but I have to admit this was one of the worst cds that I have bought in a long time!What is with this wanna be thug song, aka ""Thug Like Me""? I am sorry, but when have they even been the thuggish type? The comments at the end of the cd, which I believe were aimed at Kings One, were just plain childish.A couple of the songs were ok, but the majority were not even worth listening to.All I can say is get Jason Cano (DJ KANE)and Frankie J (CISKO) back!!!"
2,ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT THIS CD?,"I was at first excited to find this CD...but when I listened to it in my car for the first time...I was really dissapointed. There are at most, 3 songs that I enjoyed. For the most part, I did not enjoy the re-mixes of the songs ""Insomnio, No Tengo Dinero"" and others. The original songs are far better...not only that but how many of the same songs do you need re-mixed? Once again, there were only 3 songs worth listening to. So my advice is, if you have to own this CD, save some money...buy it used"
4,Stylish and high quality,"Good looking, stylish, smart and clean design, ""handsome"".Once I was specifically looking for ""animated"" watches. This was one of the results. Although, given Amazon description is really lacking details. I bought it and didn't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation. So, now I know. It has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes. One: seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display; two: seconds drop down in two halfs on the display. Thats all for animation and features in general. No light, no date, no more animations, no stoppers/timers, nothing else; just plain watch.For me, the good looks somewhat compensates the ""thing"" I was originally looking for."
4,Intriguing Life Story,"Tesla's autobiography offers an interesting dynamic to the famed inventors life. I wish the book had gone more in-depth into Tesla and Edison's interactions, but it does discuss the beginning of their relationship. A great read for anyone interested in Tesla the person, not so much the inventor."
1,NOT Nikola Tesla's MY INVENTIONS,"This is NOT Nikola Tesla's MY INVENTIONS, published in the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER magazine, February-June and October, 1919 issues. It is a corrupted version of Tesla's autobiography titled THE STRANGE LIFE OF NIKOLA TESLA. The original document was published in booklet form a copy of which was found in a used bookstore in 1994, transcribed, and published on the Internet. The booklet was subsequently found to contain significant errors, omissions, revisions and also some additions that did not appear in the original 6-part serial text.Buyer beware!"
3,ok i guess,"Good book, it seems like its written funny,not sure how to explain it though. Alot of uncapitalized i's, was it even proofread?"
1,Horrid. Absolutely horrid,"I'd give it 0 if I could. Luckily, I got this CD free. Now, radio being what it is, sometimes you have to go by what's written about a band. Usually, it works out. I would never have heard Ani DiFranco if I hadn't bought a CD based on a good review in a magazine.But this is horrid. I've heard comparisons with Garbage. This piece of trash doesn't come close. The songs are terrible, the singing made me want to toss the CD out my car window, and the production sounds like what a complete novice would do if put in a studio. The guitar parts sound so devoid of energy that you'd think the performer is watching a soap opera or something. The beats are terrible. And how did these people ever sucker Pras and Kool Keith into this?This is terrible. I'd use the CD as a coaster, much as I do the America Online discs I get in the mail, but maybe, some unsuspecting person will pay a few dollars for it."
2,We've got some Aqua wannabees here...,"I've heard there songs and they weren't as good as i thought they would be. This group is pretty much like Aqua, but Aqua has more catchy songs and they're more fun! This group only deserves to stars from me only because i guess they put in work to make this album! (in other words don't get this album, save the money and get some Aqua or heck get the Spice Girls! I even think 'N Sync is much, much better.)"
1,Give me TECHNO! NOW!,"The reviewers of this record embarresses me.... This is pure ****, all together too fussy and dreadful.. Danish dance-pop equals childish music, which doesn't even make my right foot make a move. We need more mature stuff a' la techno, not this.... euro-dance. Take it for my word, this ***** big time!!!"
2,Good Bathroom Reading -- really,"Some cute, some not so cute little stories with a twist of humour. Not good for much, excecpt . . ."
5,Good read,"Burroughs is truly a master or imagination and adventure! Like his barsoon series, this was a very enjoyable book to read. Time for Tarzan."
3,Diet Tea,Although the tea works the pills actually do nothing for me. It's supposed to make your stomach feel full and curb your appetite but it didn't do that for me. So now all I do is drink the tea when I want to be cleaned out. It's just ok.
1,Not for me!,"Thought I would give this thing a try because of the positive reviews posted here. Never thought making such a mediocre cup of coffee could be such a pain. Grinder doesn't grind, it chops--and is a mess to keep clean. I count upward of 10 loose parts to keep track of and clean. More trouble than it's worth. I suggest a burr-type grinder and using a French Press or even a simple Melitta. The Sanyo is fairly quiet when brewing so I think I'll just use it for heating the water and go back to my old French Press."
2,works well for a few months,"i thought i would add my 2 cents to people who want to buy this. i did a lot of research before i ordered it, it was the perfect combination of grind and brew and it worked very well for 3-4 months. however, lately it became really slow and i noticed that most of the water is evaporating as steam. so i guess it is overheating the water, but this is a fatal flaw, if u are making 6 cups, u may not even get 2, and it'll take 15-20 mins."
3,Disappointed,I bought this based on the reviews here and I am diappointed. Maybe I just received a bad one but it takes a very long time to brew. More than twice the length stated in the instruction manual. The instruction manual has troubleshooting instructions suggesting that there is a blockage that can be cleared by running vinegear through it but this doesn't make sense for a brand new machine.
1,Flimsy.,"I purchased this item in August of 2008, once it came in the mail I was eager to fire it, but I waited until I could get out of my town for some safe target Practice. I draw back the String(Which was deffinetly a tough job to do) and it goes in place, I take off the safety and fire it without any problems. I pull the string back for a second shot once I loaded the arrow I took off the safety and pulled ther trigger... to my Dismay the Trigger fell to the ground. it had broken off just at the firing point. I procceeded to uncock the string with a friend I had with me before Curseing and placing all the pieces back in the box for Return.I will be returning it soon with a suggestion towards non-plastic triggers. I suggest getting something with a little less power behind it and testing thos eout before going for the big one at the start like it did."
5,Highest recommendation,"If you could only own one disk to characterize the Spanish Renaissance, this would be it. The Tallis Scholars rendering of the Victoria Requiem conveys the incredible mystical and ethereal quality of the work superbly. The only Renaissance works I know which achieve the same spiritual intensity are the masses of Byrd. Listening to the Victoria Requiem in this recording, I could not help but speculate on the relationship between Victoria and his patron - of all the Renaissance masses this one seems to convey above all a sense of tragic destiny, a mood the Tallis Scholars convey with astonishing power. I have listened to this disk dozens of times, and each time I remain amazed at the power and intensity of the interpretation."
4,Review for you,"I gave this 4 stars because I don't want to discourage you from buying it. However, be aware that this dictionary is completely in Hebrew. Which, of course, it should be. I'm not sure what we were expecting. I bought it on behalf of my mother who has learned some basic Hebrew. This book is way beyond what she knows, but she is happy to have it since Eliezer Ben Yehuda wrote it."
1,UGGGH!,"Skip this dog. Cassidy has about 150 scholarships organized over and over again in different categories (like engineering, nursing, earth science, general, etc.). The index is a good idea because it breaks down scholarships by category BUT if a scholarship is good for engineering and nursing it is listed twice in the engineering index and twice in the nursing index; so you end up seeing the same scholarship over and over. Also, it says it has a searchable CD-ROM - guess what, it is a pdf copy of the book and you are the search engine - the book is faster for the little bit it offers. College board or Fastweb are much better - they are also online and free if you don't need the book. Fast web gives you email updates of new scholarships after you register."
3,New Age Ant,"A few genuinely innovative moments on this recent release from the ""Trespass""-era Genesis guitarist. Unfortunately, too much of it sounds like standard ""New Age"" product. Always ""nice"", but ""nice"" isn't always enough."
2,"Yeah, it sounds like NoFx","Don't get me wrong, this EP is enjoyable and perhaps worth the asking price for ""Golden Boys"" and ""You're Wrong,"" but since the band started cleaning up their sound around 10 years ago the albums have been consistent yet stagnant - always fun, always good for a nice snicker, an irresistable hook, an adrenaline-pumping breakdown here or there, a gimmicky song or ballad sandwiched in between; never really doing anything new or really out of the ordinary, but I suppose you can't really expect them to. The fact that you can depend on them to just be the same old NoFX is quite good enough if that's your thing, and why the hell wouldn't it be? Want a phenomenal EP by NoFX? Get ""The Decline"" (one long-ass song, and well worth it). It's a punk masterpiece. Want to add to your collection and whet your appetite for ""Wolves?"" Get this."
5,Best new punk this year!,"First off, NOFX rules! Fat Mike is a clever, great songwriter. This is a pretty good E.P. too. I for one am an atheist so i am not offended by this and think the religious humor is hysterical. The christian people need to get over themselves if they find this offensive! Just shut up! I can not count the number of christians at my school who make fun of me for being an atheist. I aint complaining! If you're a christian and offended at this, then quit listening to punk rock! Hey you idiot kids who were panning my review, dont listen to crap. Its bad for you! Im not a ""kiddo"" by the way. I am 20 and own way more punk albums than you will ever own. Do you even know real punk? do you know the Dead Kennedys? Do you know the Subhumans? Do you know the Damned and Minor threat. Christianity and punk do not mix! Oh, and by the way, learn how to spell IDIOT!!"
2,A rather lackluster recording of a classic film score by the great,"Miklos Rozsa. I found that this may have been a work done in earnest but I'm afraid this album just doesn't cut it as this is one of film's greatest scores and it deserved much better. And it finally happened with the Tadlow recording of the complete score. Buy this one if you want but the Tadlow is the definitive one to get and definitely worth the money. Sorry, but that's how I feel."
4,Great Mic for Small jobs,This set is perfect for home footage or small corporate jobs.It works perfectly on my MiniDV Panasonic and it is a great solution for such a small price.Don't expect High_Def results... It is what it is...I'm very pleased with the product since it's perfectly balanced with the price.
3,Pro 88W,"The microphone is really `hot' which is something you can fix in post.The mic output on the receiver went out about 6 months ago and I now have to go through the phone out to connect it to the camcorder. It's workable.The system is very `line of sight' which is most of what I do - walk around the corner and you're going to get some static.Overall, it is a good system for the money and what's not to like?"
3,Why 9 volt batteries?,"I actually like this mic system. But I had to buy a replacement for this back in Feb 2011 and again right now. Both times it was the damned 9 volt battery attachments. The connecting wires are very easy to pull out. While I am waiting for this replacement, I have the battery wires taped in place on the current one. Haven't we moved past this old-fashioned battery technology?"
4,nice product but not 5 star,"This is a very nice product. Chosing what you want to paint or change is very simple. It installed easily and is quite simple to learn.My dislikes are that you do not have the option of manually adjusting the color tone. Many of the colors appear to be one color in the color selection panel but are much lighter when placed on the project. It would be nice to be able to manually darken or bighten the color. Because I was limited to the color selections they offer, I was not able to find the right color for my kitchen."
2,Over-run with Global Warming Propaganda,"I knew the magazine wouldn't be unbiased, but I wasn't expecting it to be so totally overun with global warming propaganda. I expected a lot of articles to have a slant towards conservationism and environmentalism, but it seems this one issue permeates almost the whole perspective. It's ultimately nothing more than a pretentious advocacy rag. Journalism becomes irresponsible when it passes over meaningful information and facts to deliver nothing more than an appeal from subsequently uninformed perspective. I give it two stars because about 1/10th of the articles are actually interesting and it's not totall overrun with advertisements, most of which are relevant or related to global travel."
5,perfect,"well priced, will keep a stock on hand in the future. my coffee tastes better when the gasket isnt deteriorating!"
2,For die hard Faith Prince lovers only,"If you love Faith Prince, then BELLS ARE RINGING is a definite must have for your collection. If you're new to the Faith Prince experience, this would be a decent introduction ( though, honestly, I would begin by listening to Faith in the revival of GUYS AND DOLLS ). However, if you've never warmed to Faith Prince in the past, this cd will hardly change your opinion. Personally, I enjoy Faith's voice, but find her to be a one note actress with not much range. My advice: buy if you're a fan, or consider buying if you're curious,but either way, don't expect a masterpiece."
5,Tapes worn out- NEED CD!,"I bought this album on tape years ago and of course, I'd rather have it on CD! This is an EXCELLENT soundtrack and obviously, a LOT of people want it! Re-release it, please!"
3,Really good compilation,"Worth your while getting it if you find it. It's not prime Kate Bush, but that probably won't matter to most of you. Minus one star for omitting the music to the hilarious 'lawn mower' dance sequence, which is ex-Clash drummer Topper Headon's cover of Gene Krupa's ""Drumming Man."" Any soundtrack with XTC on it shows good taste, though."
5,soooo glad I found this on amazon!,"I needed this cable because I lost the one to my philips micro theatre system while moving. But, I couldnt find one anywhere. Then, bestbuy told me they could order one for me and it would cost $39.99! I almost bought it but, decided to check on amazon. Im soooo glad I did!!! I saved so much money buying it here and it works perfectly!"
3,There are some missing songs...,"Overall, the soundtrack is great. I listen to it all the time but its too bad that there are some missing songs so therefore I'm giving it 3 stars. The ones I listen to most are ""Ten la fe"", ""To be free"", ""Sleep"", ""I want to believe you"", and ""Siempre"". So if you love the movie as much as I did, you might want to to get this cd to remind you of it."
3,"""mysterious song"" decrypted:)","the ""mysterious song"" a reviewer was looking for is called ""This Years Love"" by David Gray.:)"
2,Another Song Missing!,"I really really really need to know the name of the song playing when Nicole and Carlos are in the plane! In my opinion, the soundtrack is NOTHING without this song!"
1,They better give Joss Whedon a nickel...,"They better give Joss Whedon a nickel every time someone buys this book. This is Buffy without the humor. The author has no unique ideas and the plot/characters are completely derivative (female demon hunter hiding her true identity with a internet researching sidekick, she also kills the demon with a hair pin/stick... ever heard this before). Don't buy this book, just go watch Buffy."
4,"A nice, light read","It was a cute fluff book, a quick read. The characters were likable and, given the premise, believable. There was a touch of mystery, a lot of action, and some decent wit. The writing style was good but casual, drawing you into the book. And once you get to the end you're able to see all the clues and how the whole thing wraps up neatly.If you're a fan of the `humorous horror' genre (books like Undead and Unwed) I think you'd enjoy this. It's not earth-shattering or spectacularly innovative, but it is fun."
2,Needs a Warning in the Product Description,"Like so very many CD's, this one has tracks that cannot be transferred to your MP3 player -- unless you have software that ignores or overrides the copy protection -- and there is no indication anywhere on the CD packaging, nor on the Amazon product page, that any of the tracks may not be playable.If you still have an old-school CD player, or want to listen to this on your computer, this has some great songs from the Seventies."
5,This album is phat,This album is rules.Peter Gunz and Lord Tariq rule cause they are yankee fans.De Javu is the best song man.
2,features the most annoying song ever (cept for hammer),"there is not much to listen to on this album that is worthy of anyones time.......there are only two songs that stand out besides that fake anthem ""deja vu"" that is just too straying from what this whole album seemed to be about... ""my time to die"" is a great track which takes peter gunz on a chat with god and also ""massive heat"" that gets some much needed fire power from kurupt and the ever hardcore sticky fingaz from onyx fame. maybe next time the two from the boogie down will be able to juggle the commercial and underground angles"
3,Decent At Best,"This year was actually my first time hearing the album, I was always kind of skeptical to check this CD out but I gave it a try. I was disappointed especially because ""Deja Vu"" is one of my fav songs. I'll keep it short and simple, the only songs worth checking for on here are ""We Will Ball"" , ""Massive Heat"" , ""Déjà Vu (Uptown Baby)"" , ""Cross Bronx Expressway"" , ""Be My Lady"" ""My Time to Go"" ,""Who Am I?"" , & ""Keep On"". The worst song on here by far is ""Startin' Somethin'"", not sure why they would even consider remaking Michael Jackson's song. You should at least check it out though, you might like some songs I dont like on here."
2,I cant believe it!,"man! I was so disapointed in the album Make It Reign. only a few songs were really hitting on this album. Deja Vu, Cross Bronx Expressway, and We Will Ball R really the only songs that hit hard. after the single Deja Vu not only me but i think alot of people were dissapointed in this album cause they were lookin' 4 somethin' better then what was dished out Peace!!"
3,never heard it and i dun wanna,"well u guys may like this c.d but her songs are only in disney movies, and max keeble wasn't that great of a movie. this might b a good cd since ive never heard it but i dun think i'll ever buy it..."
3,Rindge Leaphart review of Leading the Revolution,"I've been a huge fan of Hamel and Prahalad since my college days. These two were not only prolific authors but there writing on strategy and globalization was clear and insightful. The good ole days of globalization. When I saw this book, I snapped it up, but I can't say it met with my expectations. Yes, clear concise writing, as you would expect from Hamel, but I'm not sure it was full of strategic insights that I could run out and deploy. A little diss appointing for moi. Maybe I am overly harsh because of high expectations.Rindge Leaphart"
3,Cool...,"Awesome Band, I made use of the poster,just realize it looks nothing like the picture... still cool though and same pictures, just colors off and also made out of fabric, not paper. Still very cool poster, it is a black light."
5,Sheer Enchantment: The Mists of Avalon,"After watching the TNT version of ""The Mists of Avalon"" I felt that something inside of me moved me along with the main character Morgaine! It wasn't the story at all, but rather the music that enchanted me. The music takes you on Morgaine's emotional journey and beyond into your journey of life. I thought that adding Loreena McKennitt's ""The Mystic's Dream"" was an exceptionally nice touch! I hope the music from this CD (if you choose to purchase it) will move you the way that it has moved me!"
4,Enchanting music,"I bought this CD after seeing the movie and reading the book. The instruments and vocals are very beautiful and the last song ""I will remember you still"" is very haunting. The only reason I didnt give it a 5 was because a lot of the songs sounded the same and it got a little boring, but you have to expect that when you buy an instrumental soundtrack. Other than that, it was really lovely and if you've seen the movie than I recommend you buy it."
1,really worthless,"If you are required to buy this software, do not buy it even if it is free, amazon will lose free shipping fee for it and you will lose your precious time for this garbage."
1,great if you like silent movies,Crashed when trying to import wav files for short film soundtrack. Rebooted and used audiograbber to convert wav to mp3. Program crashed again when trying to import the mp3. Also crashed when trying to use anything from windowsmedia. Turned a fun movie project into a frustrating experience that chewed a lot of time without reaching satisfactory conclusion.Movie could be broken up by frame and separated by titles. You can even tint and choose different fonts. Really bites to get through all the frame editing work only to find that a soundtrack can't be added.Broderbund's rep has taken a big step down with me.
5,Greatest cKy cd,"i bought this cd two years ago and i only knew one song on it, 96 QBB, from Jackass. ever since then i cant put the cd down. cky is the greatest band ever and so is their music. if you havent seen their videos, they are awesome too. and if you ever get a chance to see them live, go, they're so good!"
5,Safe microwave splash guard,"With all the hoopla about plastic wrap and plastic containers of any kind not being safe to use in the microwave, I needed something else to use to cover dishes in the microwave so that sauces, etc. don't splash everywhere. This is good, sturdy solution - at least, nothing so far has said that silicone is bad for you. There is a large metal ring inside the rubber to give the MagicCover some structure, and it will not create sparks in your microwave. Make sure to put the grooved side facing your food (facing the inside of your dish) - I didn't do this once and had a bowl get vacuum sealed after heating up some pasta. The MagicCover helps warm your food evenly and is also easy to clean. No need to buy multiples."
4,good product for the price,i have not needed to use one yet but i bet they will work just fine great price for product
3,Not what I expected,"While I'm sure the candle itself will be fine, I was expecting 3 of them. The ad is misleading by putting 3 x 6. It was $8.54 for one candle when I could buy one for that price anywhere. I suppose if I needed 5 candles then it would have been ok, but again, I thought I was getting 3 to start wtih."
3,an error,"There seems to be an error in the #91 Cable Classic pattern. Row 14 is a wrong side row, but the instructions have you make the cable twist hereNot possible! Please correct this or help me in completing an otherwise lovely afghan."
1,Amazon critic does better job reviewing music than Co. fan,"Sorry, but the review from Colorado blasts the Amazon critic for not reviewing the music when he/she does nothing but talk about how many copies this tripe sold.Well, seven million people bought Milli Vanilli's album too and what does that prove? It proves nothing, other than with the right type of marketing any kind of crass junk like this can make a mint. The Amazon critic did refer to this as ""pomp rock"" (which it is) and that reviews the ""music"" more than Colorado Springs, who has reduced mu$ic to nothing more that $ale$) does."
2,All Right But Not That Engaging,"I found a copy of this album cheap somewhere, and so picked it up on the strength of ""Amanda"", which I had always liked. That song remains the best song here - unfortunately, nothing quite matches it. ""Cantcha Say"" is pretty good - a catchy number, but the rest didn't make much impression on me. They all tend to sound alike, tend to sound like...well, like Boston (this album took SIX years to complete? ). It didn't help to have ""My Destination"" sound (presumably by design) sound just like ""Amanda"", either. If you're looking for a Boston purchase, most people will point you towards their first release, and I won't stand in their way."
5,Masterpiece album from an album's point of view,"This is the third boston album, and retains the boston sound. However, it is starkly different in a couple of ways. In my opinion, the drums sound a little too overproduced. The guitars have a much more airy feel to them than the previous albums, but it fits with the whole album's motif and album cover. This album is also different because for example the first two albums were a collection of amazingly stand-out songs. Here, on third stage there aren't as many stand-out songs, but if you listen to the album all the way through, as one entire piece you can understand the true beauty of it. Its different in this way, and I believe should be listened to differently than the previous two. But its still an amazing album in its own right, as an entire work, and MUCH better than the awful two that followed it."
5,Tied with Boston for best Boston album!!!!!!!!!,"This is a Magnificent album like its predecessors Boston and Don't Look Back were! You can't beat songs like Cancha Say You Beleive In Me, Cool The Engines, We're Ready, Amanda, or A Man I'll Never Be! This is a masterpiece of a Rock'N'Roll album and should be one of the greatest albums of all time along with their Self Titled Debut!"
3,Guilty pleasure,"By the mid 1980s, most of the 70s arena rock bands (Foreigner, Journey, Styx, Kansas, etc.) had called it a day. Then along comes Boston's ever unpredictable Tom Shultz to reemerge from wilderness with his band's third album to breathe a little life into the genre. Listening to the album, one would have no idea that in the eleven years since Boston's first album became a smash success that punk, the new wave and music videos had revolutionized rock, managing to alter the formulas of even such dinosuars as Yes and ZZ Top. Instead, here comes Shultz with such 1975 FM radio ready fare as ""Amanda,"" ""We're Ready"" and ""Cool the Engines."" And some of us, at least, discovered that we were not to cool to take a trip down memory lane after all."
5,"One of the greatest ""concept"" albums of all time","Boston's stellar debut album may have overshadowed their subsequent work, but Third Stage is truly a magnificent album and one of the greatest ""concept"" albums of all time.Much of this CD is softer than Boston's previous efforts but it's still definitely hardcore rock 'n' roll. ""Amanda"" is easily one of the best rock ballads of all-time. The songs flow beautifully and the album's concept is epitomized in the spectacular instrumental ""The Launch"" and the smooth segue into ""Cool the Engines"".My personal favorite on the album is the energetic and uplifting, but often overlooked ""I Think I Like It"".Boston's music is a rising, thrusting, spiritual uplifting - befitting the great Ayn Rand heroes Howard Roark and John Galt. And ""Third Stage"" is perhaps Boston's best work."
2,Same old,"When I was a kid I remember seeing a hot rod magazine. In the back there was a cartoon about a guy who had the brilliant idea of creating a talking car. He worked on it for years and years, and was finally able to make it work. When he wheeled it onto the street the people were amazed. ""Look, there's one of those old fashioned talking cars."" That's the feeling I got when I first heard this album in the 80s. Poor Tom was the guy locked away in his basement for so long the world passed him by. The liner notes make a big deal of having no strings, even though it sounds like it. Well Tom, the synthesizer was old news by then. The hit single seemed tacked on to give some commercial value. At that it was successful. Too bad the rest is just a re-hash of the debut album."
4,Better than I expected,It only took the first page to see this book wasn't what I thought it was going to be about but doesn't mean it's bad. I was drawn into every page trying to guess what was next so I could write this book off as predictable; that never happened. The many twists will have you laughing out loud and then quickly looking around the room to see if anybody noticed you! It's a pretty good read but pretty tough to follow after reading Raising Fences by Michael Datcher.
4,RM Johhson never lets you down!,This is the third book I've read by him and it's as good as the rest. This time we explore the ups and downs in relationships between people not just men and women. Johnson explores the lesbian side of life. He also explores how secrets can ruin your life and how lies can make you suffer. I enjoyed this book tremindously and will continue to support RM Johnson by reading his novels.
3,It was ok,"The main characther in this book finds out that his girlfriend is cheating on him, and he set out for revenge. I don't understand how he wanted her back after all she put him through but that's how things are this day and time. I didn't like this book as much as I like the authors other books."
3,WWF Off the Top Rope Review,"This is better then the other 2 I reviewed last year. The Lex Luger-Tatanka rematch was much better then thier SummerSlam bout:both wrestling & entertainment wise. The Bret Hart-Owen Hart-Cage Match for the WWF title while a great match,it's clipped in this tape. The other 2 are forgettable at best. Overall.it's not great but pretty good. I give this tape a 6 out of 10."
2,Question,"Has anyone had any luck accessing past life memories with this Cd? I find it relaxing but purchased it hoping it would be a key, a tool to unlocking other lifetimes and that has not happened."
2,mirrors of time,"I purchased this book and CD for my daughter. It took a good week to get there. The product was damaged, the CD was ripped out of it. I contacted the seller. He apologized--he reimbursed me a few dollars off the book. I didn't want to bother my daughter to return it as it is such a hassle--everyone has busy lives. I was very dissappointed. I reordered the same book/CD from Abe books. I would not use this seller again. I feel the item should have been reviewed before it was put in the mail---to make sure it was as described."
4,"Good, but not an exhaustive treatment of the subject","This is a small book and gets right to the point. It is basically just a companion work for the enclosed CD. It's very good from that perspective,though. I enjoy using the guided relaxation on the CD, but have not unearthed any significant memories with it. (During my session this afternoon, the memory that surfaced was of working in my yard this morning!) The short length is a point in the exercise's favor in my mind; in only twenty minutes or so it leaves me feeling more refreshed than a much longer nap would have."
2,Mirrors of Time,Too little information. Lacks meat. Had I seen it on a shelf in a bookstore I would never have purchased it. Takes 10 minutes to read cover to cover. The only redeeming characteristic is the CD. It will at least help the insomniac. ...
5,Must have for the anglophilic military enthusiast,"A great compilation of tales from the touching to the comically irrelevant (be warned, some tales are really funny), as can only be delivered from a British viewpoint. Another similar book is ""Military Anecdotes"" by G. Regan, which also appears to be out of print currently. I have read this book again and again until the covers are about to come off. I love the variety of stories here. Highly recommended, and I wish Oxford will update this with a new print edition so it would be cheaper. Hastings has done a laudable job in selecting and editing these stories."
5,I Like Sykes!,"I heard of Jubilant on a radio interview a few months ago. During the interview they played the song from this CD, ""God Only Knows"" (track 9), a remake of the Beach Boys' hit. I was hooked!Jubilant serves up a musical feast of pop, gospel and the classics that will satisfy many listeners.His magnificent vocal quality proves there's nothing he can't sing - except off key!"
5,Summer Reading,This book was on my sister's 10th grade summer reading list. It arrived on time and she read it within a couple of days. We also ordered the movie so she could watch it.
4,out of ancient Egypt to today,"Excellent design, well painted for color and accuracy. Does not stand well alone. I cemented a base on it, using a plastic sheet. However, I had to rough up the surface of the little sheet and the bottom of the feet of the figure to get the cement to adhere."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"GLORIA HAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND SOUL.... SHE SINGS FROM HER HEART AND SOUL INTO YOURS.... PLEAESE DON""T STOP...ONLY A WOMAN CAN ""FEEL""SONYA K BARRELLALONG ISLAND,NEW YORK"
2,Gloria's attempt to reinvent herself proves to be a failure,"This album is not the quality music I have come to expect from Gloria Estefan. I have all of her CDs and this is the only one collecting dust. Her voice is not meant for disco. She has a voice that's meant for latino style songs and smooth ballads. I hope that her next album is more like ""Cuts Both Ways."" I think she should accept the fact that she will probably not gain a young audience, so she should stick to pleasing the fans that she has."
1,"If you love DESTINY AND CUTS BOTH WAYS, don't buy this!","I have been in love with Gloria Estefan's music since her PRIMITIVE LOVE and LET IT LOOSE albums. She is my #1 favorite artist, but GLORIA sucks big time!I eagerly went out and bought the tape when it first came out. I started listening to it and kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. Anybody wanna buy my tape? Only used once. Seriously, avoid it and buy something she made previously. You'll enjoy it far more."
4,Findingking Silver Spacers,A terrific deal. Three different types/styles of silver-plated barrel spacers. Nice looking and exactly what is advertised.
5,Fantastic!!,SWAG's CD is full of life and is an obvious expression of the artists free thinking independent of their other band activities. This environment has allowed them to create unusually great music! You will love this CD!!
2,Inconsistent debut,"Two strong tracks are on this album: the Beatlesque ""You"" and the Spongetone-ish ""Eight"". Another listenable track is the early Beatle/Lennon influenced ""Please Don't Tell"". The remainder of the CD is basically mediocre, when compared to the goodly amount of fantastic power pop music available from better-focused bands like the Churchills, The Nines, Cotton Mather, Frisbie, and many more. I'd recommend you save your money on this album and try to get CD's by those bands. Hopefully, next time out, Swag will put together an album that is more consistent in quality from start-to-finish, with more tracks like the three I mentioned above, and not an album that sounds like it was just thrown together as a fun side project."
5,Great Family Entertainment,"We enjoyed FishTales, as a family film it delivers imaginitive entertainment. Lighthearted, it involves a mermaid who falls in love with a Proffesor and his daughter with numrous surprises. It is a comedy, fantasy and mystical love story."
1,this is the worst movie ever,"Terrible acting, terrible script. My children liked it, but it was really, really terrible. Do not rent this movie. The jokes were in poor taste and definitely not appropriate for kids, who are the most likely to watch this."
1,This is really bad to be even considered a 'B' movie.,"This is one of those ""me too"" docu-drama a la Blair Witch Project, where some footage was recovered somewhere, and then someone put it together for your enjoyment. Well, it could be an excellent thrill, but the production shortcomings are way too many. The main character is cute at the very beginning but becomes too annoying a few minutes into the movie. Not to mention some other heavyset character, that irritates everyone including the audience. I was all the time wishing that he would get kill the sooner the better. It also seems like a lot of parts are missing or never explained at all (well... let's assume those footage parts were never found... LOL).What could have been an excellent plot, was just trashed by whoever filmed this crap.If you the type of movie watcher who likes the kind of movies that has no script, no director, where nothing makes sense most of the time. This is it!!!"
1,Stay Away At All Costs!!!,"Let me break this down as honestly as I can: This movie was so bad my eyeballs wanted to throw up!! I am still traumatized at how lame and sorry this film is in every area: acting, direction, special effects, etc! EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE SUCKS AND BLOWS!! Do yourself a big favor and STAY AWAY from this one, you won't be sorry! I just saved you from calling the Poison Control Center for your eyes - trust me! This is nothing more than CELLULOID EXCREMENT! I feel like my Constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment was violated!"
4,good suspense horror,"area 407 is a good suspense, horror flix that will keep you on the edge of your seat. my family & i really enjoyed watching this b-movie. i'm a amazon prime member, so i ordered this movie & watched it on my roku. if you are a suspense, horror flix fan then watch this one too. so break out the popcorn & have a few laughs. enjoy..."
1,YAWN Fest 407,"More shaky camera found footage nonsense about a plane crash and Raptors that eat them all.. boring, unoriginal and just plain stupid. If you have seen Jurassic Park you have seen this movie."
2,"Nice Idea, Way too time consuming!","This is one item my housekeeper didn't like me buying! It takes forever to clean an entire kitchen floor...you have to go over the area to wet it and scrub it, and then go back over the area again to dry it. Very time consuming and not what I expected when I bought the item. We hardly use this, unless we have a small area to clean or a spill to get up. Nice concept, but not very practical for an entire kitchen...I am going to stick with my Wet Swiffer!"
1,Worthless on tile floors,"I bought this to clean my tile floors (especially the grout) and I'm very disappointed. It takes FOREVER to clean even the smallest space and does't clean the grout like I had hoped it would. The vacuum seems to suck up the water pretty good, but I don't have an hour to spend cleaning my kitchen floor. I can't speak to how it would do on wood floors, but for me, it was a waste of money."
4,Makes Mopping Easy!,"Pros:-The spinning brushes really scrub your floor with minimal passes from the power mop.-The cleaning solution is dispensed directly onto the brushes equally so it is maximally effective.-The cleaning solution has a very low and non-offensive odor-Battery charge lasts long enough to do a large kitchen/dining area-Uses very small amount of water-Easy to fill/empty/clean-Dries floors quickly and effectivlyCons:-Many parts to take apart and clean after mopping: solution chamber, dirty water chamber, nozzle, brushes, filters, and then you have to leave them out to dryThe pros far outweigh the cons, and this would be good for any one who hates putting effort into scrubbing their floors with a mop and dirty water. It left my floors clean, shiny, and dry!"
1,Save your money...,"I had high hopes for this item, because of the Hoover brand name but I am disappointed. This thing might be one step above a swiffer, but that's it. You have to go over spots many times before they are removed. It doesn't get the edges at all. It leaves the floor really wet. Save your money and get a Floormate instead."
3,Mingus in '59,"I love Mingus, but as many critics including Martin Williams pointed out, the edited versions are superior. Buy Ah Am and Dynasty and skip the Complete Versions. I had a record called Nostalia in Time Square, recordings from '59 but released in '79 with many solos that were originally edited out, and believe me, even Mingus bands were capable of uninspired and flawed work. That's why they waited 20 years to release them, when we were all crying because there'd be no more, good or otherwise. Buy Mingus in Wonderland, while you're at it. The original edits are the best, don't fool yourself."
1,What a scam! Buy the seasons instead!,"Usually this kind of collections comes before a serious season-by-season antology is release. This is not the case! Some marketing braniac decided to release these four episodes a year after the last chapter of the collection was released. These are not never-before-seen episodes, and from the sound of it the extras are very trivial as well.Fox is clearly trying to milk a cow that sold well in the past. Do yourself a favour and buy one of the season DVDs, anyone will do. If you have the collection already, or you're a Futurama fan, you probably already know what I'm talking about.The one star is just for this DVD purpose, not for the series itself, which is excellent."
2,Disappointed,"I read all the reviews and was comfortable with buying this unit. It worked fine for 13 months, then it started toasting one side only, and now it's nearly kaput at 13.5 months. The 12 month warranty is expired and I'm off to buy a non-Sanyo replacement."
2,Wish I didn't listen to other good reviews,"Although attractive on the outside, the inside tray was stained after the first use. Could never get the non-stick tray clean. I had it for about a year, a bread crumb caught fire (I clean it regularly) and damaged the heating element. Totally ruined."
4,new to convection ovens,"I have never used a convection oven and I am really surprised how fast it cooked. I cooked a half a chicken in about 15 minutes. Truly amazing! This product also makes perfect toast and Eggo waffles. If it ever comes back as a lightening deal again, grab it!"
5,Exactly as described,"This toaster oven is exactly what I needed. Great size, not too big (some are huge) and not too small. Took a few attempts to get a handle on the cooking setting. Does a great job once mastered--in the first week we baked muffins and nachos. Far better than using a big oven for such small items. Reheated pizza very nicely as well. As far as toasting, the bottom side toasts better than the top but we can live with it.Much better looking than I expected as well. Not an eyesore on the counter (which I have VERY LITTLE). You need to keep in mind this product will help eliminate using a larger appliance for small tasks--not replace your main oven. The price tends to fluctuate so keep an eye for periodic reductions. Definitely worth the money though."
2,"Like teen love, good while it lasted","Purchased this toaster oven about 20 months ago - it worked splendidly for that time and then it inexplicably died it won't toast on the top and the oven function (thermostat) is now useless. It may be that with four in the household we killed it through over use, but I doubt it - our previous toaster oven (a crappy Black and Decker)lasted 4 or 5 years. I'm hard pressed to understand why a $90 product works out to about 60 bucks a year and then you have to toss it. I may go back to buying $30 crappy toaster ovens and replace annually."
2,Crazy T-Stat,"Does not maintain a stedy temperature. Elements come on and off constantly. T-Stat stuck and burnt out after a year of moderate use. Not good for baking, just for making toast. If you just want toast buy a toaster. if you want a true convection oven look elsewhere."
4,Good toaster for the price,"After reading other reviews about toaster ovens in the same price range, we decided on this one and so far we have been very pleased with it. It toasts evenly and quickly and bakes/reheats well too. The top of the oven does get very hot so you wouldn't want rest anything on it or have small children near it when its on, but I've found that that is true of other toaster ovens I've owned. I love how the shelf ""pops"" out when you open it so that you don't have to reach in and risk getting burned. It does have ""odd"" oven temperatures but I have found that easy to work around. It could be slightly bigger--4 slices of toast is a very tight fit. The stainless steel look is nice and matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this item about a year ago. Toasting is uneven, one side burns, the other under-toasts. After use, it makes a loud banging noise when it is cooling down. Speaking of noise, the reminder beeps (three of em)are ear-piercing and obnoxious. Plus there is no way (without taking it apart, which I attempted, to no avail)to cancel the beep reminders. I wish I would've known about this fact before purchase. Next time I'll keep looking."
5,Does everything well...,"I've had this unit for about 2 months so far. Has a weird temperature level setting and timer but it works close enough to present little to no problems once you get used to it.Does it all well. Toasts perfectly. Oven works well but can't do broiling as both top and bottom heating elements go on. However, by placing the food item on the stainelss steel grate and in the supplied black pan, lined with aluminum foil, it will cook under the top element only just fine. I've cooked up fish sticks and small casseroles.Toasted regular white bread, Texas toast (thicker sliced bread), bagels, leftover waffles and pancakes previously frozen and English muffins. All need to have their own toasting level adjusted but once you find it it works well."
4,Looks good works well,Just received this toaster oven and it seems to work well. I am still figuring out temperature control for different foods. It is very easy with a push of a button for the number of slices of toast. The actual oven is deep not wide which is fine - so far so good seems to do a good job. Good for the money!
4,Good toaster for a toaster oven,"Most kitchen folks know that a toaster is the best appliance to make toast, not a toaster oven. But if you want the convenience that a toaster oven brings and are challenged for counter space (as we are), this one does a decent job. Yes, there are still darker stripes of toasted bread directly over the heating element, so it's a little uneven, but not nearly as bad as the Black & Decker model that preceded this one. As a toaster OVEN, so far we've loved it. My mother-in-law has trouble getting past the fact that you have only six preset temperature controls and that the timer doesn't move, but she's now conquering the learning curve. For anyone looking for a good toaster oven at a good price ($65), I recommend the Sanyo SK-VF7S!"
3,What??? No broil feature???,"I purchased this product primarily to toast my buns (ha...ha...). Anyway, there is no top broil feature so when I tried to toast hamburger buns or Italian bread, the bottom of the bun burned every time. Other than that, I didn't keep the product long enough to find out how it cooks other items. This is the only product that I have ever returned to Amazon and I have purchased a lot over the years."
3,"Sanyo SK-VF7S Digital Oven from Ms P Macdonald Rye, NH",We knew this oven didn't broil as our old oven did and we're managing without that feature. This oven was chosen for it's smaller size and compact clean looks. It toasts (4 slices of bread) quite nicely and bakes our small roasts or casseroles in good order. Pretty much as we expected. We use it daily. We like this model.
4,"another good ""best of""","a very good collection of the classic Anthrax line-up. If you are not a hardcore Anthrax fan then this and ""Return of the Killer A's is all you really need. One weird thing is that on my copy it says that ""Got The Time"" is included, but the song ""Time"" is what is actually included. I am guessing this is some production error, but it is worth noting for those of you buying this for that song. Hopefully this will be corrected. The songs are all remastered and sound great, I am hoping they will remaster the whole Anthrax catalog!!!!!!"
3,Not Quite All The Greatest Hits,"This collection offers all of later hits with such early gemsas New Way To Light Up An Old Flame, If The Devil Danced In EmptyPockets, and Is It Cold In Here left off. Also, the set is not musically balanced with far too many novelty tunes like Third Rock From The Sun and John Deere Green and not enough ballads. On the plus side, all three of the new tunes are great, including the new single Texas Size Heartache. If you have the early albums, this will fill out your collection nicely."
4,Philosophically sophisticated sci-fi,"An excellent, philosophically sophisticated sci-fi novel. I think China Mieville's The City & The City owes this book a large debt."
4,Great book,The bible of massage therapy! I really hope it would help me with OSCE's.The condition of the book was 4/5 though
2,Fatal Flaw are the Pinch Points,"I like everything about this tripod except for the horrid pinch points on the leg clamps. I will often get blood blisters on my fingers or hand from unsnapping the legs due to the faulty design that allows skin to easily get caught during the unclamp procedure. This usually happens when I'm trying to unclamp the legs quietly, or am trying to keep the unclamp lever from rebounding. Take a close look at the leg clamping mechanism and you will be amazed at how easily it can pinch skin! I've been bitten by mine more times than I can count. I have now painted the pinch points bright red to remind myself to be careful. Other than that, it's a wonderful, versatile tripod. Just more painful than it needs to be."
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with the Italian cookbook I purchased.The book condition it what I was expecting and hoping for.Thanks so much,Raquel"
5,Irresistible is Right,"If you bought this Rose Is Rose book then you've probably purchased some previous books. If not, then what are you waiting for?! This book reminds us that life does not always have to be so grim. We all share humanity. This comically reminds us that life is a treasure and we should value it like gold. You will love this book, as I do. Enjoy your reading."
1,no visuals for caller ID,This is a good machine if your phone does not have a answer machine. No visual review for caller ID which makes this machine use less if you intend to use the caller ID. The black color is nice compared to the white which seem to always get dirty or dicolored after along time or heavy usage. The cost is alittle bit higher than others but the quality is good. Easy to operate and I like the messege indication.
5,Escape from stress,Very beautiful and relaxing music. You are transported from your day to day world and float back to a world of relaxation and tranquility.
2,Waste of money for serious darters,"If you have never thrown a dart before in your life then you may find something helpful or interesting in this book. For all those who play darts already, at any level, will not find anything useful in this book. Although there are about 120+ pages in this book, the text is so large that it would be more like a 40 page manual in normal size text. I finished this book in about 1 1/2 hours and felt cheated afterwards. For the serious darter, there are better choices out there."
3,There was too much blood and guts for me.,"Did they really need to show an actual open heart surgery? Their point is that more vegetables equals less heart disease and cancer. Fine, but I don't need to see proof during surgery."
5,Great documentary if you're willing to give it a chance.,"Forks Over Knives is a powerful and extremely educational documentary, if you allow yourself to watch it with an open mind. More than a few friends of mine have started making healthier eating choices after watching this documentary. I can't recommend this enough."
5,"Not the only things needed to know for health, but a large part...","This movie is fantastic--especially for people who are totally ignorant about the importance of diet for health.The other information I would add to this movie would be about GMOs, organic foods and mental health as being very important aspects of health-but I don't blame them for not doing it because it is another layer to an already volatile subject!!!"
5,forks over knives,"This DVD along with ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease,' by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn make a case against eating the way you probably do. Or, hopefully, confirms that eating 'anything with a face,' among other suggestions is bad for you. This program grew out of ""The China Study,"" by T. Colin Campbell, PhD and Thomas M Campbell, MD which in and of itself presents a case for eating whole grains, vegetables, fruit and beans and legumes. I begin to follow this diet 3 months ago. I have lowered my blood pressure to a normal range from a stroke range, reduced my bad cholesterol to that of a healthy teenager (I am 75) and LOST TWENTY POUNDS. I am not a 'foodie,' so it is easier for me to stay with the program than for people who love food and live to eat. On the other hand if you love to live you will want to read these two books and watch the DVD."
5,Amazing information!,The information in this film is amazing and should be required viewing by doctors (of several specialties) of their patients!
5,a must watch!,"I thought I had read it all and seen it all in the ""food"" movies and books of recent times. This movie really hit home, just like John Robbin's Food Revolution. The studies and the evidence are astounding. It is just amazing how blind most people are to how their diet affects their health. Hopefully the plant based, whole foods way of eating will become more mainstream as more people see FOK and other movies and books of this genre. And then I won't seem so weird with what i eat..... :)"
5,VORACIOUS VEGAN,"Wonderful collection of a great variety of delicious recipes. My husband loves this stuff and half the time he doesn't even know he's eating Vegan !! (he started out a ""Reluctant Vegan"" but not any more !) I find I can vary or add available veggies from my garden to many of these easy recipes. Very well put together and many tips, explanations, tools, and basics. In companionship with the first Forks over Knives Plant-based Way to Health, it is a great resource for good eating."
5,"Falling for the ""Okey Doke""","The multitude of illnesses that a vast majority of the general public face are magnified by corporate greed and, too often, our own physicians. We fall for the ""okey doke"" of commerical advertising within the food industry and the so called food pyramid that purport how we should balance our plate. When we truly understand that our body IS our temple and should be treated with the upmost respect and love, ignoring what you feed the body and mind is paramount. This documentary tops my chart of MUST SEE! Your very life and that of those you truly love can depend largely on the action you take. If not today, when?"
5,Important and Non-Judgmental,"This documentary is fantastic. It follows the careers of prominent medical professionals and researchers in the field of nutrition-based healing. It also follows the stories of a few regular people whose health has improved because of diet changes. This is not a wimpy-hippy-granola approach to a plant-based, whole food diet. This film does not judge, but offers user-friendly information on what a meat- and dairy-based diet is doing to our bodies. Check it out. Seriously."
5,If Only We Had Known,"All my life I was taught, I heard, I read - completely false information about how we should eat for good health. This book makes it clear that our food industry, in bed with the FDA and government has catered to its own interests, not that of the health of Americans. The food pyramid we were taught in elementery and high school showed our protein needs satisfied only by a thick juicy steak, whole chickens and dairy products. That is completely backward. ""Forks Over Knives"" clearly proves that ALL of our nutrient needs are satisfied with a high nutrient, low calorie diet, composed mostly of green leafy vegetables, fruits, beans, and legumes. America is almost half obese now, and getting worse. People cannot lose weight because of the false information we were taught early on and continues today. Read this book, and you will add not just years to your life, but life to your years.Indespensible information!!"
5,Worth Seeing,I've been interested in learning more about the benefits of a plant based diet. This dvd really taught me alot. I'd recommend this for anyone considering starting a healthier way of eating. The book was the same as the dvd with recipes.
2,Forks over knives,"This DVD acts as if it were written in the '50's. There is no mention of organic, grass fed, free range, no chemicals , no drugs. It is difficult to credit anything to it. Monsanto is far superior and worth the watch........"
2,Just okay...I guess.,"I purchased this for the public library I work at because a lot of our patrons really liked Food Inc., but this one really falls short for me. It blabbers on about how America eats too much meat with music that sounds like the Dragnet theme playing in the background. Much of the info is repeated. Forks Over Knives was not what we ecpected, but to the shelves it goes. I guess the patrons will let us know what they think."
1,More hype than science,"This video has been mostly debunked here:edit: Sorry the link apparently is not allowed, so you'll have to find it by googling it yourself.I'm not (and neither is that site) saying that following this diet is bad for you, but the science behind it is very flawed, and the reality is, eating the right meat like tuna and fresh dairy products is just fine.And to sum up what it stumbles most on is this logical fallacy: correlation is not necessarily causation."
5,Everyone should see this!,"As a Health Coach, living a balanced life is so well worth it. This movie lays out for us what animal protein by big agri-business is really made of. After watching it, I became vegetarian! I'm here now to buy more copies to hand out to clients."
4,interesting,"There is some interesting research presented in this video, specifically how meat/dairy protein is related to degenerative disease. I certainly don't plan on becoming a vegan, but think there is evidence that the amount of protein we eat in America is way too much. I like the idea of centering a meal around fresh vegetables. Some of the conspiracy theory about medical professionals and the government seems a little much."
4,Fantastic content deserves better production quality,"The content in this video is absolutely essential if you want to have a life without disease. We have embraced all the concepts discussed in the video and have never felt better. It is heartbreaking to see so many of our friends with declining health yet refuse to change their diets.The animations, script and voiceovers were very good quality. Much of the video, however was not. This information is so important that the viewer should not be distracted by the poor production values. I was disappointed that many of the very important interviews had distorted audio and in many cases the video had distracting artifacts, washed out color, poor lighting and did not appear to be have been de-interlaced. From a production point of view, the video is not worth the price charged."
5,Review for Forks over Knives,"my daughter has been after me to watch this and how profound the message/video is. I work for cardiothoracic surgeons and let me tell you.......if more people heeded this information, there would probably be less patients needing surgery. BTW, my daughter, who is of the ""now generation/self sustaining""."
1,Total waste of time,"Unless your a rabid food freak and corporate conspiracy nut, avoid at all costs! Even my wife the fitness food Nazi couldn't make it through it. Instead spend the time planting a patio herb garden or a couple of tomato plants."
5,"I agree with ""informative, but not convincing.""","Informative, but not convincing is right. Colin glosses over the millions of Chinese from the study who consume less than 10% of their protein from animal products (including cow, pig, chicken and any milk or eggs). One doesn't need to be a purist as the Chinese have lived for millennia. Americans have changed the feast to the common meal."
2,Disappointing performance,"I bought these as the surround channel speakers with Polk Audio front and center channel speakers. Granted that surrounds are effect speakers, but these you hardly heard a peep out of ever. When you did it sounded like a transistor radio. Is there a reason that Bose does not publish frequency response and impedance data for these? I replaced them with Polk Audio TSi-200's and without changing any settings - WOW now that's what we're talking about! I would not recommend buying these Bose 161's for an application like mine."
2,no bass,"weak sounding odd looking,TV speakers sounds better than the speakers,disapointed with them,was thinking that because of the name Bose it would be a great product,maybe they should stick with the wave radio."
1,This is not plug and play,"I bought these for a friend (with his cash ;))because they sounded as if all you need to do is plug them in and enjoy great sound. THINK AGAIN. Oh, you mean you don't have 18 gauge speaker wire laying around the house or perhaps you will need the 16 gauge if its more than a 30 foot run. How about an amplifier? BOX OF THESE ARE REQUIRED!All I want to do is plug this into my damn cable box and enjoy. Why does life have to be so complicated.This sucks and is going right back to amazon.I got Bosed.you can find the real bose manual here: [...]"
2,Old Technolgy,"I see where this camera is selling used for $2000. Lets face it. This was a great camera 6 years ago but $2000?, no way. Time has passed it by. I realize it's built like a tank and has a fast burst rate but in every other way a new $600 DSLR is superior. In my opinion if you pay more than $500 you're wasting your money, unless you're a collector maybe. The IQ can be matched in most ways by a new P&S camera."
3,Hav Plenty...well just enough to to be satisfied..good!,This cd was a decent cd. babyface hooks up another good soundtrack(not as good as soulfood) and keeps u listening for a while. Some tracks here are weak but there are 3 reasons to get this:track 3: Coko/jon b./ jay-z - this is my favorite jam on the album and they mix jazz with hip/hop to mkae one of thightest tracks on this cd. This should have been a single.track 6: Faith- This track gives u what faith is known for..her good singing and slow jams. this one could be a single for her too. The best slow jam on the album.track 10: jayo/dmx/method - this track is the best rap track here. Turn up to full volume and blast.Overall it was god. If there were more good tracks here I would rate it higher but there were none. Check it out and see what u like.
4,"A fine lens, but not one without its limitations","I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static ""Warhammer models"" with my 10D. I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were ""too long"" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose. Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in ""startled"" subjects and missed shots.The same also applies for non-macro shots as well. Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well."
1,Interesting story...BUT,"The re-union story is interesting, and perhaps it happened. But, none of the band members credited on this CD are listed on previous Prisoners' albums. Graham Day is certainly not here; and he wrote most of the Prisoners' memorable songs. So, yes, the music on this CD is OK...but, this is not the Prisoners who released ""In From the Cold"" or ""Taste of Pink"". Caveat emptor."
2,Broken after 3 months,"This was a great product when it was working, but it stopped functioning after only about 3 months. I would consider it worth the price and pain of installation if it lasted at least 1 year."
3,Wish it comes in a bottle of powder with a measuring spoon,"This is for my tiny cat that weighs only 7 pounds. When I used 1/2 capsule of powder, she wouldn't eat the wet food. So I probably use 1/4 to 1/3 each time. It is not easy figuring out the exact amount to use each time, and the capsule sometimes won't close appropriately. I'd prefer that it comes in the powder form with a small measuring spoon."
5,Don't want to take if off the camera...,"What a great lens. I have started using it and I really don't want to remove it from the camera, it is that incredible. The pictures are color perfect and sharp as a tack. The movement is smooth and precise and the focus is very quick. I only wish I had gotten this lens earlier. WOW !"
1,Listen to your Mother -- Stay away from the dump,"I had high hopes when I began my journey through the 'Dump'. After the first few chapters my journey became a nightmare of a filthy home, unkept children and a mother too busy trying to find another worthless relationship to care. In her quest for a man she trashes the personals, which she deems as being too subdue, and wonders where all of the rapists are that keep the support groups busy. Even during a visit to the Vietnam Memorial Wall, her grief at the sight of the names is directed at the pity of losing so many potential husbands. The only recipe that I found was for disaster."
2,Broke in 30 minutes,"My son has wanted a kendama for months. He finally earned enough money to get one and he picked this one. I ordered it he waited impatiently for a week to get it. He immediately started playing with it and within 30 minutes he dropped it on our concrete patio. The top part with the cups broke off where it meets the handle. So after all he waiting he only had 30 minutes with it. Granted anything dropped on concrete has the potential to break, it was just really disappointing. After this we discovered that there are wooden kendamas that have a separate spike and cup pieces. Had one like that fallen it would have had a better chance of surviving I think. We will be looking for a different kind to replace this one."
3,Fun toy,Liked the toy over all but was surprised it was plastic. My fault...Fun and great to play with for all ages.
2,sorry,it not being wood made it too easy to play with and the string was too short sorry but he wasnt very happy
5,Cathy gets better and better!,"I have read all of the ""Cathy"" books and have enjoyed them all. If you are already a Cathy fan you will not be disappointed when you read this book. Cathy is funny to us because most of us can relate to her situations. Enjoy!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I didn't buy her CD but a co-worker of mine did. He plays it over and over and over again. I'm forced to listen to it on a regular basis. I finally asked him who she was, and he gave me the scoop on her. He bragged about how many albums she sold. I got to give it to her....she sold thousands of albums with no talent. I'm no music expert but I know what I like and I don't like her music. Her voice is not pleasant to listen to and it just sounds like she yelling."
5,"A must read for all Doulas, Midwives and Childbirth Educators","Having a baby is a transformative event. How we choose to change and grow during this event is a profound choice. This book fills the void for those of us who don't want to ""know what to expect when we are expecting"". ""Spirit Babies"" gives the ultimate gift: The tools to delve into the spirit world to meet your baby and initiate that rite of passage into becoming someones parent.Through Walter's wisdom and guidance, my husband and I had a beautiful and amazing birth experience and I am now becoming a certified doula.Walter's insight and compassion is bettering births and empowering parents. Ultimately, creating a better world one birth at a time."
1,Do NOT BUY this,"This item is a complete waste of money - I have had better images and quality with tiny cheap wireless spycams.All I can say about this product is that it does not work, so don't waste your money.The range is extremely limited - If I set up the receiver close to the camera I get an OK picture but very poor color quality.As soon as you go a minimal distance, even 10 feet, you lose all color and the picture quality is very poor.I have not tested this at night yet, but the day time image is shocking.It is not even worth the effort to send this back, in the trash it goes!"
4,Brings the space setting to life,"This book really drew me in, for a lot of reasons. Martin has an outstanding gift for dialogue, and his ability to describe setting is in my mind unparalleled in the genre. The characters in this novel are interesting, especially the protagonist Tuf. He isn't the typical hero, though his surprising streak of altruism makes him both unpredictable and endearing. Fans of Space Operas and Fantasy alike should give this sleeper a shot."
2,Not at all like Paradise in Me,I loved paradise in me. The whole CD rocks!Cocoon Crash just isn't doing it for me. I impulse bought the thing based on my experience with Paradise in Me and boy was I disappointed. The only songs that sort of rocks is Cocoon Crash the rest are pretty slow and too soft for my taste. I've only listened to the whole thing once and its first impression hasn't been good. I just hope that it grows on me in the future. That'll teach me to impulse buy without checking out the samples on Amazon first. If your not looking for a CD that's going to rock all the way through this would be a good choice. Too slow for my taste.
1,Sorry?,"I have never bought a worst cd in my life! I don't get how everyone put 5 stars for it! I bought this cd simply for ""believe"" and ""everything for free"". They were the only two songs that I liked. How could someone like a song like ""butterflies instead""? It's awfull! I think that Sarah what's it had a terrible voice and that the guitars are only so-so. I'm sorry to all K's choise fans but the only song that i can say i liked are ""believe"", ""everything for free"" and ""cocoon crash"" so... to anyone interested... buy the singles and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!"
4,BUY IT!!!,Hello! This CD should be part in every good collection. Sarah's voice is so awesome and every day without a song of K's Choice is a bad day. GO FOR IT.
1,A potentially great lens with a high defect rate,"I bought this lens a few weeks ago and it consistently produces out of focus images at f/2.8 through f/4.0 Amazon was great to work with, and they sent a replacement which turned out to be defective as well. I've shot several hundred images on each, under various lighting conditions, using my 5D Mark II body. The two exaples I evaluated are very poor performers at f/4.0 and wider. One went back to Amazon as defective, another went to Canon for a warranty claim.I hope they can fix this lens, because I really want it to perform as well as some of the better examples of this product out there.If you buy the 70-200 f/2.8 L IS, be sure to test it at wide apperture values while you can still return it.Shame on Canon for a poor quality control process."
4,"Nice, but heavy.","This is a super set of optics, but it is heavy. The weight, 3-4 pounds, doesn't sound like much, until you carry it for a while. Aside from the weight issue, it is professional grade, solidly constructed, works as promised, and delivers crisp images. Just remember that it is heavy. Cheers!"
3,Nice lens but...,"This is actually a very nice lens but considering how much better the 70-200 F4 IS is, it's hard to like this beast. The size and weight difference between these two lenses is enormous. I also was not happy with it's performance wide open (especially at 200mm) so I would generally be using f4 to get the sharpness I demanded.Because I shot it at f4 so much there was no need to be lugging it around. I sold it for the f4 IS and now I get even better results and my shoulder is thanking me."
5,Take the plunge. It's worth it.,What a fantastic lens. I do a lot of low-light concert photography and this lens expanded my range of motion a great deal. No longer do I have to be right on top of the performers to get a close up. I can also explore the creative use of Depth of Field with much greater ease.It is a heavy piece of glass without a tripod. Fortunately I work out so the weight doesn't bother me over the course of an hour or two.I was a little worried about having to find a case that fit and a hood. Fortunately both were included with the lens.
5,Superb Addition to Canon Reble,I spent alot of time evaluating this product. Finally after reading the reviews I dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense. It has been a wounderful addition to my Canon Reble. It is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time.
1,"Come on Joe, move on","You can read or download for free Geneiveve Berhends book, ""Attaining Your Desires"" online. Her original book was much better than this chopped up version that Joe pushed himself into. This book ""How to attain your desires"" is nothing but a money maker for Joe. Please, go find her first book which is free, I have it on my pc and read it often and was disappointed in his version that Joe is making money off of. READ THE ORIGINAL FREE PEOPLE!He has his adds taking up about a third of the book in the back pages, it's truly disappointing to see someone who already has his money take a dead persons work to make even more money off it.Also read ""The Message of a Master"" by Joen Mcdonald, another deceased man who understood your imagination creates reality. It's also free and is downloaded on my pc to read at will.Move on Joe, you have your own works, leave Geneiveve's works alone, for you did not add a damn thing to her works, but I'm sure you gained plenty. Disgusting."
5,A+++++ Very nice,"Awesome job, I was in a bind because I needed this for my Anthropology class. And I lost my copy while on a family trip! OOPS! And Amazon had it to me just in time for me to finish and score full points on the exam!"
4,Good compilation by an awesome band,"I'm surprised that Y&T (originally called Yesterday and Today) didn't achieve the huge success that they deserved but they were fairly big back in their prime and they earned alot of respect from their fans and they got strong reviews by the press as well, the singer's voice reminds me of Sammy Hagar back when he was in Montrose.My only gripe about this CD is that they didn't put Lipstick 'N' Leather on this compilation but it's no big deal cause this CD, but if you're a casual fan of Y&T or a casual fan of hard rock/metal music then this CD is a must have but I would recommend their other hits compilation Best of '81-'85 which contains their best songs from their prime period and this CD has most of their songs from the late 70's stuff to the mid 90's."
5,Catchy metal that still sounds great with the passage of time,"Mean Streak, Rescue Me, Don't Stop Runnin' and Summertime Girls are holding up real well as forgotten gems from the 80's metal era in my opinion. Never understood why these guys didn't make it big. From the comments on this page, it seems i'm not the only one who wonders that. anyhow, if you are looking to run down some fun metal from the 80's after you've listened to the usual suspects for the umpteenth time, start here!"
4,Good place to start.,"Ok,I would not have picked half of these songs for my best of,but is that not always the case.But if you are new to GE,this is definately a good place to start.The good tracks are better than good,and the bad are better than bad, ehh.What I meanis,that GE is so much more than these 12 tracks and they got a great deal more to offer than this.If you get this and youlike it ,I am sure you will venture in to other cds by this quality band."
5,Major American works,"Stunning performances, beautifully recorded. Includes the late composer's son perfoming the work for solo marimba, RELFECTION ON THE NATURE OF WATER. Congratulations to all involved in putting this together."
4,Instantly likeable..,"I have had this cd for less than 24 hours and I can already hum half of them. When recommending music to friends, I try to follow one rule: I liked it the first time I heard it. Well, buy this one. Natalie Merchant's on this one as well!"
4,Great album,"Personally I prefer the 2nd album, but both are great. I don't give it 5 stars because a few of the Billy Bragg sung songs fall flat for me, but all of the Wilco tracks are excellent."
2,Not convinced.,"Apologies to Messrs. Bragg and Wilco, but I found this recording lacking in the tune department, although I admire their motives for attempting the project.....maybe I am missing the point? Gordon"
5,Don't Miss Classic !,"What a treat it was when I brought this one home, some albums take a few listens to before you really appreciate them but that was not the case with this one. After the first listen you'll know you've got the real thing. And what an inspired (or in retospect obvious)choice in Wilco.It now holds the record for the longest stay in the car cd changer.One great song after another,""Califionia Stars"",""Ingird Bergman"" and so on. My six year old loves ""Hesitating Beauty""and has memorized all of it's Guthrie lyrics. Great songs, music, and singing in the Gram Parsons/Buritto Brothers tradition. Not to be missed"
4,"Well Designed, but Costly","An excellent treatment of art history with lush illustrations and well written text. However, quality comes with a price."
2,Only b/c it is a class requirement,"Stokstad's book is surprisingly biased, and full of subtle indications of cultural elitism. While this is a common problem in Western-published books on the history of art, I always find it galling when confronted with specific examples. Perhaps it is wrong of me to give a low rating to a book which has failed to be better than any of its peers, but I only purchased this textbook as a course requirement, and am still irritated by the expenditure."
4,Thank you,"I had hoped to receive the book earlier, however it ended up working out. Otherwise service was good."
5,you control the cartoon,"how amazing is this . today i brought this game into work to a hardcore gamer . he left work and spent 3 hours in his car trying to complete the game until the battery on the psp gave out to be recharged . my opinion . this will be one of the top games. sure its not grand theft auto , or daxter , or syphon filter .what it is ,is family guy . it has all the elements of the cartoon , all the scarcasam , all the people in the cartoon . this game is funny , witty .its not super hard but if you like fun then get this game. its actually interacting with cartoons. i have to admit i had a problem putting it down myself. if your a fan of the caroton or just like fun then get it.one of the best games i have played and the psp is my main platform. some games like gun or call of duty look great on a pc . but this games fits the psp perfectly . you will enjoy it"
1,Worst game EVER!,"This is possibly the worst game ever created. Personally after playing this game I have honestly considered quitting playing games, throwing my psp in the trash then burning it and then shoving the family guy video game up the creators A$$. It's long and boring and honestly the most frustrating game. The annoying cut scenes (at least some of them) cannot be skipped. 2k and Fox have ruined family guy buy creating this abomination. I wish I had the amnesia ray thing from men in black. With Amazons rating system even giving this game 1 star is incredibly over generous."
5,"Good candles, good value","I bought three of these candles a couple of months ago and found them to be long lasting, nice looking on our table and a good value for the money. It is hard to find any candles that are this good for such a low price."
1,Rip Off,"Picture on ad shows multiple candles. What I recieved is one (1) small candle 3"" wide by 3 inches tall. This product is extremely overpriced. Don't be fooled. Buy your candles at the dollar store."
4,Rare Finds on This Disc,"Listening to this CD is, for the most part, a genuine pleasure. Purchasers should be aware that it contains remastered recordings ""from original V-Disc radio transcription recordings,"" so they should not expect original commercial releases. The sound quality can be tinny at times, but doubtless the compromised sound quality of the sources has been compensated at best as possible. As noted by other reviewers, this disc also contains other snippets from broadcasts, including a soundbyte from an FDR address, a commercial for Kraft Foods, and a PSA for ""Tire Registration Week.""One should be aware that the CD's producer, Rod McKuen (yes, the singer/lyricist and writer of LISTEN TO THE WARM) has taken the ""producer's privilege"" and recorded his own vocals to ""We Mustn't Say Goodbye""; his essay contained in the CD booklet offers far more personal nostalgia than information about the songs and recording artists."
3,They just keep getting better,"I have the seaon 1 & 2 boxed sets now and can't wait for 3 through 5 to come out. If you don't have the season 2 boxed set yet, you don't know what you're missing. I especially liked the Tok'ra part 1 & 2. My favorites."
1,Poor quality control,"Very poor quality control!I just bought some of the Thinpacks and have problems with discs on season 1, 2, 3, and 8.I have yet to watch other seasons.Some episodes are simply unwatchable due to defects in the discs.I checked each disc carefully and they are not scratched, but there is a manufacturing defect in them that causes these problems.Luckily, I bought these seasons on sale for $9.99 each but I would caution anyone about buying the Stargate SG-1 dvd's.You may get discs with errors on them that render some episodes unwatchable.Here are the bad episodes on my Season 2:Disc 3-episodes 4 and 5Disc 5- episodes 3 and 4"
5,Star Gate review,"This is the best take off from a movie I have seen ! I would indeed give the movie and the series a 5 star rating, as well as the movies that followed after the series ended.I would also suggest people consider watch Star Gate Atlantis as well .Did not like how they ended STA , but still worth watching ."
5,Incredible Universe,"Stargate SG-1 is series that never fails to entice your imagination. The diversity of the Stargate allows an incredible amount of various scenarios, through which SG-1 is able to continuously display their incredible morals. Each member is put through a hard lesson in this season, from Daniel to Teuok, allowing them to show their ability to prevail in a tough situation."
3,Fun but skippable,For some reasont hey decided to go with a clip-show for the season finale in Season 2. While it is a fun ride all this episode boils down to is a collection of clips without advancing the storyline at all.For a clip show it is actually well done and if you have the time its worth a watch but you wont miss anything by skipping it.
3,MGM Doesn't know how to use the DVD media.,"I imported the DVDs from England about a year ago. Why are they only just becoming available on this side of the pond now?Regretfully the DVDs are just copies of the shows. Granted GREAT COPIES: Clear, powerful sound; beautiful, sharp colors and focus.And a couple of short inteviews witrh SG-1. WW!MGM could have done so much more with these multimedia rich stories. And it only took them 6 years to bring to market!Still, I'll buy every one, but I'll never stop bitching."
3,Okay Season!,I thnk that Season 2 was okay. It could of been a little more dramatic. I did like Col. O'Neill in his uniform.
5,"Sugar Women's Da Bomb Wedge Boot, Cherry Blossom Actually Is Da Bomb","This boot is cute, comfortable and not too expensive. I'm a larger size 10 (10s don't always fit me but 10.5 can be too large) and these fit nicely. The platform wedge is a heel one can wear comfortably all day even when there's a lot of walking to be done and the soles are very light and don't stress one's knees. The floral pattern on the fabric part of the shaft makes this boot distinctive and a great casual style with pants or skirts. Roll your pant legs up, tuck in skinny pants or wear crops to show the pattern - the light color shows up well in dark clubs."
1,The internet is the best cigar resource,"I bought this thinking it would be a good reference and tell me something about all the different brands of cigars, but I don't find any value in it whatsoever. I feel like the author wanted a quick buck so he cut and pasted alot of crap from back issues of his magazine into this book so he could sell the same opinions twice. In addition to that, the brands discussed are very limited and only a few examples from each are featured. Take my advice: I realized that it is dumb to buy any book that claims to lists different types /brands/shapes of cigars because the information is always changing - look on the internet at cigar sellers' websites and cigar makers' websites, where you will find everything you need."
2,Disappointed,"My product came in the mail and it was not in pristine condition. The packaging had also been torn wide open by the time it got delivered to me. I also ordered the Small (Yellow) because I already owned the Large (Blue, Which were too large). The smalls are described as being perfect for someone starting master swimming. I am that someone, but I also have a substantial background swimming competitively when I was younger. My hands BARELY fit in these paddles. These paddles also bend when I swim. I do not have giant hands, I have average male hands. I am 25. I am unhappy with my purchase."
3,"Useful book, despite its errors&#65533;","If you happen to be a Perl Hacker who wants to get into Python, this book is just what you're looking for. It's written from the perspective of a Perl programmer who has made the switch to Python. It introduces Python while explaining the relevant differences to Perl as it goes. There are also lots of code snippets showing Perl code along with its Python equivalents.This book does have some problems however. It has more typos in it than any other programming book I've ever read. That applies to both the text itself as well as some of the code samples. There are also some places in which it explains things assuming knowledge of something else that isn't described until further on in.That said, I still found the book useful, and for me it was probably worth the purchase price. I would just recommend that readers be very wary of the typos as you go along."
2,A chance to hear the great Teresa,"Although there are some aspects of this CD I don't like (the pop sounding arrangements, for one), it still represents a chance to hear the great Cuban vocalist, Teresa Garcia Caturla. However, if you really want to know why she is such a good singer, listen to the Estrellas de Areito releases. It is on these that you can best appreciate her rhythm, energy, and humor."
3,Not sharp enough for me,"I have the Canon 35/2.0 prime lens, which I like very much but on my Canon XTi, it's not quite wide enough. So, I purchased this lens and also a Sigma 18-50/f2.8 EX Macro to take on vacation, thinking the Sigma would be used for more flexibility, and the 24mm for a very light walk-around lens.In my tests, though, my 24/2.8 wasn't nearly as sharp as my 35/2.0. It might have just been my copy of the lens, I don't know. But, the Sigma was as sharp as the 24mm. So, I returned the 24mm, and will keep the Sigma. With a prime, you lose the zoom, so it better be both a) sharper and b) brighter (wider aperture). Since it was the same sharpness as the Sigma, and no brighter, back it goes. I was thinking I'd sell my 35/2, but now I'll keep it, as it's both very sharp and has an f/2.0 aperture.Again, it could have have been the copy I got, but since my Sigma fits my needs, I won't try again."
5,Bad Little Hannah Book Review,This book was a Christmas gift for my mother. It will probably be the most remembered. She had this book as a little girt and was overcome with joy to have it in her possession again. She enjoyed the story and even rediscovered some details forgotten over time.
2,ABRIDGED - falsely labeled,"I am very disappointed that the copy is advertised as ""complete and unabridged"" - right on the cover! This is definitely NOT complete or unabridged. Les Miserables is a fantastic book, but I would not recommend this publication by ""Enriched Classics"". Nor will I buy any from this publishing company again. I believe they should label their books honestly and correctly. If you want to read an unabridged version, do not buy this book."
4,"Solid, sturdy mounts at a good price.",They look nice and allowed for flush-mounting on the side of our fireplace because of the 180 degree rotation. I use them to hold 15lb speakers and they are plenty sturdy.The reason for 4 instead of five stars is that they strongly suggest you use wood screws to fasten the bottom and side of your speakers if you use the tilting ability of these mounts. The addition of front and back clamps (similar to the existing side clamps) would have eliminated that requirement for my speakers.
2,Disappointed,Razor doesn't lock in an outward position and wasn't very sharp. I wouldn't recommend this and will buy a different razor.
3,Just Fur Looks,I mean come on you really think your going to get a quality razor fur $6 I mean come on man
3,"NOT, a shaving razor...","This blade is much more of a showpiece than anything usable for shaving. If you're a collector or are putting together a corner of the bathroom for retro beauty, you could do a lot worse than this blade. The handle is not plastic as written previously, it is wood and the rivets are pretty solid but the blade is completely not suited for shaving."
3,Bought this razor as a gift,"I bought this item as a gift and it arrived yesterday. First, it was not as pictured. The natural wood handle is silver in color and styled with imitation wood grain. This was not a selling point for me but buyers should be aware of this. I ran the razor along some cardboard and it seems sharp enough to shave with, though I can't confirm this with an actual test. Three stars because it arrived on time and looks suitable but was not as pictured."
3,Dull,It came three days early however it was too dull to use. It does look nice though. Very professional. Still highly dissapointed.
1,came much too late,"When you have the nerve to charge so much for shipping and handling, for an item so small, you should be professional enough to have it arrive on time. I needed this item on time for a showcase and left up to two weeks for it to arrive and it still hasn't. I placed the order on september 3rd and it wasn't even shipped till Sept. 8th. How lazey are you people?! I never intend on purchasing anything from you again and had it not been for your poor return policy, I would ship it back when it EVENTUALLY arrives and demand a full refund."
2,A Decent Knockoff Of A Real Razor...,"For a 7 dollar Chinese knockoff, this razor looks pretty good. It was, of course, in no way remotely sharp enough to cut even twine, let alone facial hair.DO NOT buy this razor to shave with. It won't work. Most razors use a type of high carbon steel, not stainless steel. Unless you have hundreds of dollars worth of specialized sharpening stones and several strops packed with paste, this razor isn't getting sharp enough to shave with.This is, however, a great razor to practice straight edge shaving with. It also looks good sitting on the counter with the other razors. It would also make a reasonable boot razor if you were so inclined.Overall, the fit and finish are impressive for a faux razor. It looks very pretty. I enjoy seeing it on my shaving counter and it's fun to throw in my boot and pretend I'm Beatrix Kiddo's right hand man. If you want a real razor though, look at the Dovo line."
2,"Nice looking, need a professional sharpening","This razor looks very nice for it's price, but it is barley sharp enough. Also the pivot point on mine is a little off, it hits the right side when closing."
4,28-135 USM IS,First off this is a very nice lens for the money. I have had mine now for about three months and love it. It is a great walk around lens the 28-135 is just right for most pictures of kids and landscape pictures. It has a fast focus and sharp clear pictures clear up to the 125 range gets a little soft at 135 but easily fixed with a little post editing. I have taken most of my pictures hand held and the IS works great. I even recommended it to a friend. I am using it on the 30D and it spends most of its time there. I am not sorry I purchased this lens and will be taking a lot more pictures with it in the future.
3,Be aware that Amazon will send you a whitebox version for MSRP of $479,"I know whitebox version is identical to retail version but for a MSRP of $479 I would expect a retail version, from Amazon!My review of this lens compare to my 15-55 II and 55-250mmPros:* Better build quality* Great zoom rangeCons:* Not silent as expected, noticeable IS noisy* Slower focus in low light, not expected from this USM* Not seeing better image quality"
4,Excellent Lens for the money,"This is a great lens! I've been using it for the past year and have no complaints. For the money it delivers each and every time with great, clear and colorful images. Is it comparable to Canon's ""L"" series lenses? No, but you have to pay two to three times the price for one of those lenses. If you're budget is small and you're looking for a great lens to be your basic ""all-purpose"" or ""walk-around"" lens then this is the one. Check out my website [...] if you'd like to see more sample images from this lens. All of the pictures on the site are taken with this lens mounted on a Canon 40D. You can buy this lens today and have no regrets."
4,Canon EF 28-135,"I have had this lense for a month now. It has worked out great in just about every situation that I have used it in. I was amazed how well it took pictures on IS even when I was at the end of zoom range and using the stock flash. The wedding I used it for work great except for two things. The 28mm did not give me a wide enough angle that I was hoping for. Also, the only issue I have encountered is it has a problem focusing during low light conditions. I have not had a chance to contact Canon or see if I can reproduce it, so this may have been isolated incident. Otherwise I would definitly buy this lense again."
4,Its a good starter Lens,"OK..Its a very good starter lens. But more and more I learned, I started finding flaws with it.But as a starter lens when it came with my 7D as a bundle for #230 more, It was worth getting it. But if you are going to pay full price of over $380, Avoid and get an L lens for a bit more.Pros:- It was only $250 since it came as a Kit.- It takes good overall pictures as a walk around lens. The colors and contrast are spectacularCons:The Build is shakey/Loose/creeps...- At 28mm, The kit lens 17-35 is sharper on the edges. Yes. I compared. The edges on the 28-135 at 28 with the Kit 17-55mm lens and the 28-135mm lens is downright blurry.- Some CA (Chromatic Abberation) but this can be removed in PP using Lightroom software."
5,Wonderful lens!,I just tried this lens and I was quite impressed with how clear the images came out in very low light. The image stabilizer (IS) really works well and it allows me to take pictures that look like the suns out when the room has almost no light @ all. I'm only a novice photographer but I do have other zoom lenses that DO NOT have an IS and it is very hard to get clear images in low light settings.
2,Autofocus Problems,"While this lens takes pretty good pictures, I can't endorse it's purchase. When I received the lens, it looked like it was in good condition so I installed it on my camera. I quickly realized that autofocus was not working properly. After testing different shots and different conditions, the autofocus would only move every so often, and the camera would not take pictures because the AF wasn't working. When AF DID work, it was very slow and sluggish. After awhile, it wouldn't work at all. I brought it to a local camera store, and they diagnosed it as a bad motor (all other lenses work on my camera, so it was not the camera).The lens worked fine with manual focus and I don't have any complaints about the picture quality.I'm not sure if the bad lens motor was due to Canon's QC or if was due to the infamous subpar packaging of lenses from Amazon. Either way, the lens was defective and was sent back."
5,Censored!! Why??,"Thanks to the economy, I now have too much time on my hands and decided to watch all the Simpsons box sets I own. I never noticed it before, but this box set contains a censored scene. In ""I Married Marge"", Marge is defending Homer to her sisters by saying how sweet and sensitive he is. She then looks over her shoulder and nervously murmurs. In the syndicated reruns, you hear Homer honk the horn and shout, ""Marge! Get your ass out here!"" Why do they censor the episodes? This also happens in season 4 when ""Marge Gets A Job."" Overall, the episodes are still great, but the censorship needs to stop."
5,Inexcusable Delay!,"This is a great season of the show, and I have anxious to buy it since the second season came out .... LAST AUGUST. What on earth is taking Fox so long to get these things out on DVD? ... . When this finally comes out, enjoy some of the all time great episodes."
2,pretty bad,"I Have season 4+5 on DVD, and I just got this one. Some say it is good compared to 1+2, but it suks compared to 4+5. the only reason i give it 2 stars instead of one is for the Halloween one and radio bart. so I guess if you have later seasons than this one, DON'T GET IT! If you have seasons lower than this one, go for it."
4,Episodes Great! Menu/Special Features Lackluster,"I felt like I waited forever for this set to come out. When I finally purchased it, I was very disappointed in the lack of menu options and the plain presentation of the episodes. Although this set really shows the Simpsons we know and love the packaging and menus leave much to be desired."
4,GREAT OVER-SIZED WOK LID,"For the price, this lid can't be beat. It's very light weight, so don't expect a nice heavy-weight lid for this price. I use this lid on my 14"" skillet as well as with my 14"" wok, so it's very versitile in my kitchen. The ONLY reason I gave this lid 4 stars is because the inside of the lid became slightly discolored after the first use, but the functionality was not affected in any way. If a person wants a nice heavy lid--pay a nice high price; this is the best buy for the money!!!"
2,When platformers go bad...,"While the game keeps Family Guy's signature humor, nothing else translates well here. More fun to watch than it is to play, this game is riddled with unholy (and illogical) platforming bits. The less than stellar controls make everything from jumping, shooting, or walking around an incredible chore.As a fan of the show, I'll say that the humor is there, but there is a bit 'borrowed' from the show, and one liners that get repeated far too often. Fans of the show will buy the game no matter what (just look at me!), but for anyone looking for some fun in their game, look anywhere else."
3,Dry...but fast.,"Don't get me wrong. Ottmar continues to do what he does best--play great flamenco-influenced music, lending his own personal take and a few other influences to the great tradition of the fast and furious guitar, but for some reason this album just doesn't do it for me. Too much studio fiddling, too little wild improvisation. Go for his live album Viva! long before you move on to this new release."
1,definitely on the bottom percentile of the bruce lee clone movies,"Bruce li is the best of them, but he is still sad. Real martial arts stars did not go that route.Now the whole movie Li is a cop trying to infiltrate this guys mansion, does, and takes him down at teh end.But the end gets really good, seriously. Lo lieh (pak mei from ""executioners of shaolin"" and ""fists of the white lotus"") and a korean kicker show up and bruce performs decently. So if this movie wasn't 94 freaking minutes long, had a point, and had 1 other good fight, I would have given it a 4."
5,Great video game.,"I have always played guitar hero and this one didn't let me down. Great song list. Great downloadable songs. Never had a problem with the wireless guitar. After playing this one and going back and playing Guitar Hero 2, this one is harder then the others. Love the challange. Can't wait till the new one comes out."
4,Hitting the fun Notes,This package deal was AWESOME!!! I couldn't find a better price anywhere else! The game works great and so does the controller. I've had no problems with the guitar and I love the stickers that came to decorate it.
1,I could never play the game,"The biggest disappointment, and had since bought by Amazon.com. The game arrived on time, but was unable to connect to connect the guitar to play, I saw that internet reading is a very common problem and no one gives you an accurate answer. Do not buy it, find another game"
3,Horrible Lag,"I definitely agree that there is some rather bad lag with the PS3 version of the game. I have a feeling that it has something to do with the mysterious dongle that is used to connect the wireless controller to the console, that none of the other versions of the game seem to have. I too have GH 1, 2, and 80's on the PS2 and I blaze through them on Expert. I have also played GH3 on the 360 and the gameplay was right on and there was no lag whatsoever. Needless to say, when compared to the 360 version of GH3 the PS3 version is just not worth buying. Thats not good at all IMO seeing as how this was one of the games that I chose to buy for the PS3 instead of the 360."
5,A Very Underrated Comedian,"Earthquake Is one of the Funniest Comedians out there today. He should have been an Original King of Comedy. I'm sad to see that he was overlooked. He is halarious. All of his jokes are funny and on point. For anyone who likes explicit Stand Up comedy, BUY THIS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED."
3,Not like the photo,"Have a pyramid cake for my birthday and I bought this figurine to ""Spear"" another figuine on the cake. problem with that. The spear doesnt point down like in the picture. it runs straight across the guy's face.Tried to bend it to point in the correct way and it doesnt bend. So I had to angle the guy differently to get the affect."
1,Ugly,This software is so bad that I finally just took it off my computer and put back on the free software that came with my camera. Don't be fooled by the Broderbund name.
4,"Four Round, Silk Woven, Dreamy Stars of Blissful Escape.","Wonderful - Lounge-inspired pop with some great lyrics belted out by a beautiful voice. A very smooth but somewhat dark album. A welcomed change of pace from all the awful stuff thrown onto the airwaves this year. Fans of the likes of John Cale, slower Bowie, Red House Painters or The Tindersticks will LOVE this disc. The record has a nice compete feel to it, without a filler tune among the lot. This disc along with Turin Brakes, The Troublemakers and I Am Kloot have been in heavy rotation in my player the last week or so. Why not groove on in for a listen? - yours, C-Dub-Ya."
2,If you actually want to listen to punk...,"...don't buy this CD. Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy. There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan. It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well. The upsides to this compilation are as follows: one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive. However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all."
5,Simply Grand,"This is a lovely studio recording of tunes written by English songwriters from the past century. Numbers such as 'Cherokee', 'The Touch Of Your Lips', 'A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square', 'If I Had You' and 'On The Road To Mandalay' are included in this collection. John Bunch performs, as is his custom, with sensitivity and restraint, nimbly caressing the melodies in a way that has become his hallmark. There is only one word needed to express it all - sublime."
3,Good film,"Good film that does support the obvious. America is consumed with beauty, and with the advent of being able to manipulate images gives unobtainable goals for our young girls. When six year old girls are worried that a new pair of jeans will make the ""ass look big."" we are not doing something right. (my granddaughter's comment)"
5,"This is not the documentary on the situation described. This documentary is about America, the Beautiful.","The reviews given for this documentary are about a different production. This documentary is good and wholesome, not what is described."
3,"Was excellent until they ""improved"" it","I and my family loved this product. Over the years I have bought seven of them and given some as gifts. Now they have ""improved"" the replacement brushes. The original brush they called ""Cyberspring"" (part number C239). They said it was patented and all that. It had a little spring at the base of each set of bristles. The new brushes (including Cybersonic 3)no longer have these springs and they last about 1/4 as long as the original brush and turn all fuzzy right away. I doubt that I will buy anymore Cybersonic products. Too bad, the shortsighted bean counters screwed up another good product."
5,A story with many levels for understanding and enjoying,"This is a powerful,beautifully written novel that has the ability to speak to the reader in many different ways. The first time I read it was for pleasure and I could not put it down. I literally finished the last page and went back to the first page to read it again. Each reading has given me a different level of understanding and I am sure that when I read it again I will learn on still another level. What a rarity for Kabballah to be made so accessible and what a surprise to have it in the form of a very readable novel. You will be swept up in the lives of the characters and captivated by the stories. I am looking forward to the sequel that is due out next year!"
4,Rescue Josh McGuire by paned2,Rescue Josh McGuire is a great book for people who like animals. This book takes place in Bozeman Montana. This book is about a kid named Josh who ran away to save a bear cub. Josh has a friend named Otis who tries to save as many animals as he can. When this boy runs away he takes his brother's motorcycle and heads to the mountains to hide from his parents. Before he ran away he left a note that told his parents if they wanted to come home they had to meet his two demands: 1 he could keep the bear cub and 2 they would stop all the bear hunting laws for at least spring (because bears mainly give birth to their young in spring). This book is great for young adults. This book is one of my favorite books. I rate this book 4/5 because it is a great read. I highly recommend this book.
3,You Will Be Depressed,"I struggled, thinking, okay, it's a four star, sometimes five star film, but the ending, the motivation of the characters and overt violence did the film in. Three stars for beautiful cinemotography and a mesmerizing Danial-Day Lewis, an interesting take on the early oil business, but that's about it. Depressing really!"
2,too grandiosely flawed...,"Daniel Day Lewis is incredible even though I found myself thinking about that character he played in GANGS of NEW YORK at times and I absolutely love Paul Thomas Anderson films. That said, I could not get through this film, the score was dreadful, the pacing montonous, it was all so heavy-handed and melodramatic. My wife made it through about and hour of the film and I tried again after she went to bed. Alas, it was not to be."
1,what a disappointment!,"well, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I can state right now, what a waste of time and 2 1/2 hours of my life I can not get back.Daniel Day-Lewis' character was uninspiring - I couldn't get up the emotion to hate his character (which I have to assume is the emotion the director wanted me to have). The preacher was cut from a cookie-cutter stereotype, the relationships of Day-Lewis with his ""son"" was unbelievable.The only interesting bit of this movie was learning how dangerous it was to work on oil sites at the turn of the century."
1,there will be blood,"what a long, long, long and boring movie!!! i thought it would never end. i didn't want to turn it off as it was so boring i knew i would never put it on again and i wanted to see if anything worth seing actually happened. it didn't. there's 2 1/2 hours of my life i will never get back."
3,Save your Money... the Blue Ray is comin' soon.,"MOVIE : 5 stars / Packaging: 0 starsYou'll either love or hate this film. I will not go into reviewing this since everyone and their grandma has done the job. All I will say is that it was my favorite flick of 2007. The film is dark, atmospheric, and the soundtrack, in my book, is as much an essential character as Daniel Day Lewis.If you love this movie, do yourself a favor, wait for the Blue Ray. Don't waste your money on either of these discs. It will get scratched! All the complaints are 100% true. If you came up with a solution to prevent this, kudos to you...but I shouldn't be coming up with MacGyver solutions so a disk does not get scratched in its own packaging.I pray to allah the blue ray will have normal packaging...either way, it takes much more to scratch a blue ray...so it is a win-win solution.If you don't have a blue ray, do yourself another favor, use your tax rebate and buy a PS3."
3,"If your not in a bad mood, you will be after this movie.",This movie is about greed and pride and how ugly they can be. Its long and tough to watch in parts. I really don't think I could sit through it all again. The movie starts out well but becomes less entertaining as Daniel Day Lewis character becomes meaner and greedier.
2,slow and depressing,It is hard to like the characters and the story was not interesting enough unless you are interested in oil.
3,OK--Not great,This movie is better than the average Hollywood junk. However DD Lewis rips off John Huston's voice from Chinatown and the end is really bad. I felt that he didn't know how to end it.
2,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...oh, its over","This movie was long and boring. If you need to take go to sleep, but cant, pop this movie in and you'll be asleep in a matter of minutes. Daniel Day - Lewis did a great job playing the independent oilman Daniel Plainview, but he turns into a prick by the end of the movie. Movie was out there, I cant say that this was a masterpiece at all. I wanted more out of them welling for oil then what I got. I must say that the fire incident was pretty cool, even though it left his son, H.W. deaf. Overall, not a good movie."
3,Bloody,"I purchased for a gift to someone and I've never seen it so I can't review the movie. But I hear it's rather violent and bloody, but anything Daniel Day Lewis does is gold."
4,Wild Wild West,"Another real doozy of film from 2007. I love PT Anderson and this is another winner from him. It plays like one of those major melodramas from the earlier years and does not fail to pull you in in with its theatrics. Day-Lewis deserved his second Oscar for sure and damn if Paul Dano is not the exact opposit of his Little Miss Sunshine trip. It keeps spilling over the brim, but it's sure worthwhile."
4,Good movie,Daniel Day Lewis is terrific. It's amazing to see him in a variety of roles. Enjoyed watching this rather dark tale.
4,"What can you say, Daniel Day-lewis is a Fine Actor",The Story had its dark moments and the Acting was indeed fine. If I had to do it over again I would have prob watched it on Pay-per-view but if your a fan of the Actor its a must see.
1,Can't believe the packaging,"I won't be buying this DVD for the packaging they put it in. It's a disgrace for the serious collector, worse than snap cases and that's saying something! -kd5-"
2,Way Over Rated,"There Will Be Blood is probably one of the most over-rated movies of all time. It's chopped up, uneven, incredibly over-wrought, and self-righteously over blown. In all most every way it has none of the greatness of an epic such as Dances With Wolves or Giant, though it touts itself as being such. The editor has taken a movie with a fabulous opening sequence and followed it with a chopped up series of sequences that are sparse meanderings that span a man's selfish lifetime. Nothing leads to nothing. Violence leads to nothing. It's just stupid. Daniel Day-Lewis' incredible performance aside, this movie sucks. When it was finally over, I was only too glad. Everyone that I know that has seen this movie has said the same thing, ""what the hell was that?"" Disappointment abounds."
1,THere Will be BlooD! (((U will be in a pool of blood))),"There will be blood from u killing urself or the ppl u invited over killing u after this awful movie is over! The movie was very slow, EvEn for my 60+ yr old mother. (SHE WAS UPSET) but I must say all the acting was great! Cinematography was wow! But the script was terrible! At the end I was like, as one other poster said it ""That's it!"" It was more disappointing then the season finally of the Sopranos! [...]"
1,Do not bother,"This pessimistic movie is not only mostly boring but morbid, ghoulish in parts, coupled with having an excessively annoying, nerve jolting so-called 'soundtrack'.In terms of the aging process of the two main actors in depicting their historic evolution from 1898, until this picture's dreadfully droning, bloody, psychotic conclusion in 1927 -- it does not exist. What were they thinking to make such total rubbish.To sum up, with the exception of the fine cinematography, forget-about-it."
4,Another great teen movie,My kids love it. Ages 12~18. The 18 yr old boy even said this was a good flick. Now they'll have date night at our house.
4,recieved,I received the movie in a timely manner. There were no scratches or damage of any kind to the disc or the case considering I bought it used.
4,"WITTY DIALOGUE AND A WINNING PERFORMANCE BY STONE, MAKE THIS TEEN COMEDY A CUT ABOVE THE REST!","Reminiscent of those 80's high school comedies, 'Easy A' adds a refreshing feel to a very old premise. Emma Stone is excellent as a girl who can't say NO, but what she doesn't say No to is why you need to see this film. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are fun as Emma's liberal parents and the entire cast seems to be enjoying this delightful and fun romp through high school for the umpteenth time."
1,Another Sleezy Attack On Christians,"Another childish attempt at shallow humor...The story of a teenager doing 'anything' to be popular is so trite but what is really disgusting is the portrayal of the Christian students who are presented as dimwits...Anyone who has any exerience in public schools will tell you that for the most part the kids who are influenced by the Christian, Jewish and Buddhist teachings are usually the school leaders, great students and filled with common sense...but this character smirking must go on so as to diminish the influence of people who have found POSITIVE ways to live compared to these down graders of our civilization"
1,Don't buy this movie,I saw this movie on amazon instant and it cost me $4 and I wish I had my money back. I was a waste of both my time and money.
2,"Good Premise, Poor Execution","This movie seemed like it would tackle some interesting issues (in a light way). Unfortunately, it was one of the most boring movies we have ever seen. My spouse fell asleep about 20 minutes in. The streaming quality was excellent. There was no buffering."
5,Enjoyable,"This is a movie I picked up in the hopes that I'd see scantily clad women. There was a little bit of that, but not much.What I actually got was a somewhat smart movie with an orange obsession (seriously, look for the oranges) about a girl pretending to be slutty and how life spirals down around her.I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice. Three times if you count the time I had it on to provide background noise while I played video games."
3,OK,IT'S OK BUT DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR IT A STORY ABOUT A STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL TRYING TO GET HIGH MARKS
2,BLAH,"Certain points the movie is clever, and it rightfully tips it hat to far better teen flicks from the 80s. But, it was mostly a blah fest. Not horrible, not great--just blah."
2,Not an Easy A to Sit Through,"The premise sounds engaging enough an adoption of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter with a teenage edge. Even better the cast is full of solid names from Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church, Lisa Kudrow, among others, but this movie comes across as more than a little disappointing. Where it tries to deliver the good message of being careful about the lies you spread, it seems to turn into something of a crude human sex joke complete with gay guys pretending to be straight, friends who change at the drop of a hat, teachers having affairs with students, something just misses very badly and it turns into something that is not really particularly amusing or funny, but rather as something that passes as boring and unmemorable. While certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, it kind of just passed without any feeling or reaction from me. Maybe I'm just too old for the alleged humor in this movie."
3,3 1/2 stars for an above average teen comedy,"I tend to shy away from most teen comedies, but this one is a reminder of the John Hughes classics of yore. Smartly written, well acted and funny. Sure, as usual, the California high school depicted in this film has many ""yeah right..."" moments but even with a pretty stupid premise, it comes off smart. Emma Stone is adorable as a chaste teen that takes one lie about a sexual liaison and makes a profession out of similar ones with various classmates. She even goes so far as to wear a scarlet letter on her chest, ala Hester Prynne. As is predictable, her actions have more serious consequences. Olive's (Stone) parents are played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. They are fun to watch. I would have liked to have seen more. As it is, this movie stands out in the genre."
5,Emma Stone Rocks!!!,my first time seeing Emma Stone in a movie I must admit and she was sooo funny. Not your typical high school drama movie...this one was more laughter and flair. anybody debating on this should buy it now and watch it asap. I didnt listened to all the people saying crap about it and finally went to the nearest store and bought it. My suggestion though just go up this page and click add to cart right now.
4,"Fabulous, and thought provoking!","This is a very poigiant play dealing with the issue of racism at a small New England college. It made me re-evaluate what racism truly means, and think about how our actions, even on a subconsious level, can at times reflect prejudice."
1,Spinning into garbage.,I have made the mistake of reading 3 plays by this playwright. This was the last straw. I was bored with every preachy moment. A play written by a white person about white people trying to understand racial tolerance. Next!
4,Austrian Operetta,"Listening to these two Austrian operettas is somewhat like listening to a Broadway Musical sung in a forign language. This is especially true of the Abraham selection, The Flower of Hawaii, since it sounds like it could work equally well in English. These are amusing, but perhaps not for every taste."
2,Kriemhilde and her revenge *spoilers*,"*****Spoilers*****I guess what really got me was the fact that Kriemhilde didnt have that lust for revenge, I mean, she said she wanted it but you couldnt see the hunger in her eyes. She also didnt seem to care that she was killing all of her brothers in order to seek her revenge. There just wasnt that NEED to do what she was doing, I guess that all boils down to bad acting though. I felt there was a lot of emotion missing from this movie, especially from the lead, but her and her revenge was the movie, so it just drained the whole film because she was indifferent most of the time."
5,Garfield Fantasies,"Garfield: His 9 Lives is only the special from this DVD that I remember watching on CBS. I'm a cat lover, and the life with Garfield being the white cat watching its owner grow up always makes me sad and happy at the same time. Garfield's Babe and Bullets and Garfield's feline Fantasies are both new to me and I enjoyed watching them on DVD."
5,Welcome to Key West!,"I just got back from Key West. Had a wonderful time and very much enjoyed reading this book while I was there. Very simply, it is a very fun read. At the same time, it has some great philosophy that is part of the story. The characters were well conceived and fun. This book is probably not going to win the Pulitzer, but who cares, it was a fun read. Also, it gives you good amount of info about Key West without reading a travel guide. If you are going to Key West, read it."
2,Not as fun as it should be.,"Well it looks like it would be a fun game, but I was really let down with this one. The graphics on the games are very small and there is no excitement when you hit spin or place a chip. It does say that you can create a character, but you are not given the option. Not worth the money."
4,Good for beginners,"This book is very easy to follow and great advice for those who are just starting out in working out. For those who are more advanced, it's a bit rudimentary. Aside from that, it's a quick read and a fine reference for fitness beginners."
4,Great Album...but way too short!,"From the very beginning, this CD will have you listening and wanting more. Poledouris does a wonderful job at combining orchestral, vocal, and synthesized music. From a Russian choir to adrenaline pumping action, this album has it all. What makes this score work is that it is enjoyable to listen to outside the film- and it does an outstanding job with it.The best tracks:-Hymn to Red October (that Russian choir is awe-inspiring, powerful, determined and simply amazing) -Nuclear Scam -Course Two-Five-Zero -Chopper -Red Route 1 -Kaboom!!!The only thing that prevents me from giving this five stars is its absurd short length (about 30 minutes!). Also, the tracks are all out of order. Fortunately, though, it's only 12 bucks. Highly recommended."
2,last of money and time,"i took it out the box made sure everything was ok. charged the batt. put it in the water and it had a list really bad so i had to play with that for about 30 mins,trial and error,it ran for about 5 mins, and it started to put put and i almost lost it from it floating away.the shipping took about 24 days.i tried to fix it like my other tugs(alantic,aqua tug) but always had problems,its cheap made for a cheap price"
1,Very Poorly Engineered,"Was purchased for my 14 yearold grandson. What an embarrassment!! He placed it in the family pool and it immediately fell over to it's starboard side!! Very unstable, very poor design. We tried adding ballast which did help a little, Then the motor failed. Nice to look at but don't put it near the water!"
2,turns my hands blue!,"This stroller is a pain to fold, you DO need two hands, and the ink bleeds from the handlebars. It is a pain to clean. I have only been using it for 4 months, and I am planning on buying a different one."
2,This Album Blows,"This is a horrible album. I own and love Live Art and also their first album Bela Fleck and the Flecktones... Basically this album is extremely corny, monotnous,lacking in energy, and over produced. I enjoy the flecktones, I've seen them live and loved it, but this is just a very, very bad album."
2,Not up to their standards,"The Flecktones are simply an incredible group of musicians, but this particlar album falls short of their other efforts. The vocal numbers tend to drag the entire CD down...that said, for a used price of $4 or so, I would still buy it for the several more enjoyable tunes on it."
5,nothing to start with !!,"Why is this book nothing to be read ?Because if you start reading the first book (you'll end some 3 to 4 hours later, when you've read the last line), stopping your daily duty just for buying the 3 sequels, wondering for some years 'When will the 5'th book be written ? WHEN ??'you are no longer the same person at all.You start thinking about building a house somewhere in e.g. Montana, learning about explosives, guns, extraterrestial biology and the usuall stuff to surwive an alien encounter of the very most dangerous kind ever possible.Thank heaven someone from the future (David Gerrold) wrote some books about what happend so you will know.and by the way: you'll never trust a tiny worm and the easter bunny again - for sure"
5,Classic Science Fiction,Don't know where or how I picked up this book but it sat on bookshelf for some time. Picked it up and read it in one sitting. Could not put it down. Outstanding science fiction and highly recommended to anyone. Looking for the other three!
3,"Weapons detailed, gore clinical, characters complex, SF tops",Apparently unintelligent alien worms infest Earth and thegovernment has something it wants to hide from a good boyMarine with some complicating post-adolescent sexualitysubplots back at the Base...My main recommendation for this book is the interspersedhigh school rememberances of a special class on Politicsand the Way the World Really Works. Brilliantly writtenexpositions of how and what teenagers should and can reallybe taught to protect their freedom in a democracy. Thecondensed reallife classroom learning *should* be compulsoryin every classroom.
2,A lot of Hype but not enough to back it up with,"While Paul Chek has some good information published, this book is not that great of a resource. The idea behind the book is solid, but he tries to cover to many topics in too few pages. In the end I would recommend something else."
4,Nice 70s soundtrack with a couple of flaws,"There really isn't a bad track on this compilation from the 1978 movie. Chances are if you liked the movie, you'll like these two discs. In fact, the music probably is better than the movie. There's nothing new or surprising here (why should there be?), but it's a well-put-together and highly listenable set.Why it had to be put onto two short discs, I do not know. Disc 1 is around 39 minutes. I forget how long Disc 2 is, maybe a little longer.I could live better with that if only Linda Rondstadt's terrific version of Love Me Tender had been included from the movie.Ah-ha, I thought, I will just buy a DVD of the film and copy that segment. Won't work, because near the end of the song there is voice-over dialog from a concurrent scene.The sound quality is fine. If you like this kind of stuff, also check outHip-O's 33-track Classic Rock Gold."
4,good overview of her broadway career,"Before Barbara Cook became a cabaret performer, she was a fantastic Broadway star. This out of print cd focuses on the songs from her revivals and original productions with the omission of The Glass Harp. It goes chronologically from the beginning of her career with the shows Candide, Plain and Fancy, and Flahooley. (Sadly they were flops.) Then it reaches The Music Man where she finally became a star. Her Till There was You is marvelous. The last three songs are from her 1975 At Carnegie Hall album. I wish that this was replaced with numbers from her shows. It doesn't quite fit in with the phase. I guess this cd wanted to be an outlook on her career in general. Barbara Cook had a clear warm soprano. If only her 1958 album Songs of Perfect Propriety could be released."
5,Using it as a power source rather than a charger,"I have a device (a svga-tv image converter) that is powered (rather than charged) by 5V USB, and when my computer went kaput, I could no longer power it.This little adapter has been plugged into the wall and powering my device for weeks continuously, with no problems. A perfect solution to what I needed - so for anyone looking for a 5V USB wall power solution, this is $5 well spent."
5,Excellent Book - Authentic Recipes,"This book offers authentic recipes for Persian dishes, salads, cookies, etc. It has transformed my wife to a real chef ... Now I can eat all Persian foods with no need to visit the motherland!"
5,What a tasty ride!,I am glad I had decided to buy this book. It takes you on a journey of discovering a new face of an ancient culture through the refined flavors of its traditional cuisine.
3,Too many mistakes!,"I bought the book to try the pastry recipes and it has really disappointed me. There are typos and mistakes in the amounts and ingredients. Such as saying egg yolk instead of egg white (p:282) or saying the dough will rise when there is no Leavening agent in the recipe (p:284). It might not make a big difference in savory dishes, but for pastry details matter. I just wish better proofreading was done."
5,This is it!,"This is the only Persian cookbook you will ever need. It has every imaginable Persian recipe, it is laid out clearly and easy to follow with beautiful photographs. Some of the recipes are very elaborate but after having done them a few times they become easy and quicker to make. A great book for everybody who loves to cook. Both, children of Persians who grew up outside of Iran and don't know how to cook the food their moms cooked for them as well as just people who enjoy good, rich food will really appreciate this book."
1,Color for girls,"I like the TYR model, but this color is for a female. The rep should ask me if it was for me when he called."
5,Awesome book!,"my mom got me this book for my birthday and so far its so cool! I can totally understand what the messages are because i have the same things happen at school. it really helps me think about God more and gives me stuff that i can do to really be a better Christian. thank u, joel!"
3,Ok..but could have been better,One of those movies whose best scenes was in the trailer previews. I found the kidnapping and subsequent search was a bit contrived.
1,Boring,I just thought this really dragged and there were no characters that sparkled or made an impact on me. A waste of money.
2,not worth it,"Very few laughs, would not rent again. I wanted to turn it off 30 minutes in but kept watching hoping it would improve and be worth the money I spent to rent it."
3,A pretty good kiss,"Great actors and fun situations make up for the cheesy writing. It was well worth the rent, you should check it out!"
2,A TOTAL HUNK A JUNK Dont pay more than 3.71 for it!,"Well if your looking to get a product that is as pictured you will be very disappointed Lucky I only paid 3.71 for it, it looks like it walked straight off the dollar discount clearance rack the quality was very poor it is thin plastic with a gaudy look to it the packaging was nicer than this plate I could not get the screw out to place the battery's because even that was cheap and it stripped easily I thought I was getting a pretty good deal but lucky for me I got what I paid for worth a try at this price thoughI gave this 5 stars for durability only cuz it was made of plastic so theres not much damage that can be done"
4,"Good, Considering the Price","I've bought two of these: considering it holds 1000 DVDs, this is a good mass storage solution for the price.The only thing I would recommend is to replace the crappy plastic shelf pins they supply with your own 3/16"" (5 mm) nickel plated spoon shelf supports for the sides and angle shelf supports for the back. For DVDs (3x8=24 shelves), this is 96 spoon shelf supports and 48 angle shelf supports."
1,Ok if you want to teach stereotypical gender roles,"This book was all about father and son building a dog house, using all of dad's tools. Just seemed like very old school gender role placement to me. Ok if you like that sort of thing. We are giving the book away."
1,Boring and a little Strange,"I purchased the Grandma and Me and Counting Kisses books by the same author and it was so cute so I thought buying more would be a no-brainer.I was disappointed when I bought this title and the Mommy and Me. They were both unusual. In this book the child is looking for tools in the garage while they are building something and there were screwdrivers under a newspaper, which was weird. Then, the end all of the sudden shows a dog house and a dog named Henry in it. You really couldn't tell that they were making a dog house and where this dog came from.I returned the book."
4,Another winner from Karen Katz!,"We love Karen Katz's books at our house -- the illustrations are adorable, they're just the right length for our 1-year-old son's attention span, and he LOVES to open the little flaps.Just two small complaints:First, I really wish the flaps on these books were a little sturdier. My son has already ripped one off. *Sniffle* (This goes for ALL lift-the-flap board books, by the way!)Second, has anyone else noticed that the first page reads, ""first we saw the wood,"" and the next page says, ""Then we measure the wood""? This drives my husband INSANE! Every time he reads this to our son, he reads the second page first, so that our son learns he should measuring things before he cuts them, not vice versa ;)"
3,empty promises,"The product description was misleading. First of all the included activity book supposedly covers 1-6 grade operations, but the revised version that came with our set only covers grades 3-6. We could have used more simplified operations that focused more on number concepts and relatedness. In the same vein, the 1000 unit cube isn't made of solid plastic like the other pieces in the set. This has caused some confusion when drawing comparisons between the different units...why would the thousand unit piece have the same weight as a 100 unit piece. Will be trying to contact Learning Resources to see if there's a replacement option for the book...would welcome suggestions on how to fix the empty thousands box...maybe we'll just switch to the solid wood option."
4,"Electric Fun, Rock Jubilee","Electric Fun-This CD exhibits a more ""fun & electric"" approach than we see on earlier Grant Lee stuff, it is still very moving and emotional as always. Oddly enough this CD may actually be a safe place to begin on the Grant Lee tour if you are more into straight ahead rock, it feels strange saying that. There are a few tunes that will be immediately gratifying, which is not always the case with Grant Lee, the Copperopolis CD requires dedication and repeated listens to find all the gold within, where as Jubilee has some immediate payoffs which will help those introducing themselves into sticking around to uncover the whole work. I love this CD and think it has a real chance of bringing a more diverse audience into the Grant Lee Buffalo arena."
2,emblem size,"I thought I had measured the proper measurement, but it turned out to be a tad too big. It would have been better to be a tad small."
5,"Become a better salesperson, by effective time-management","If you are new or has been an average sales person, this book would help you to became a lot better, via effective time-management. It's not about sales skills, but about you, about how to keep track of your time spend on the real ""sales"" activities. Dawson assumes you have enough knowledge about sales, so he focused on smart time-management. The author treats a sales job as a normal ""job"", he help you to create a time-based weekly sales goal, then during the week, you will keep track of the actual sales time. Once you meet your time quota(honestly), you could forget about sales and enjoy your time-off. It helps you to build a honest and persistant work habit in sales, balancing work and family time."
3,Passes the kid test...just,"In the grand scheme of things this book is a classic, but not on a par with 'Green Eggs and Ham', 'Marvin K Mooney...', 'The Digging-est Dog' or many of the other offerings that Dr Seuss has. At least according to my 2 year old nightly book selection."
1,not a great 5 button programable mouse,"I just bought this mouse and wanted to get rid of it right away.Drawbacks:1. The Switch Application button (the one on top) is located way back. I always have to curl my finger hard to press this button.2. The palm rest is two high and it feels like you do not rest your palm at all. Sometime, it hurts your ankle3. The Back button is designed way back. I do have to pull my hand back to be able to press this button => extremely inconvenient4. The Forward button is located on the right, I rarely use it since it hurts my little finger everything I tried to locate and push it5. The software does not work instantly. Sometime, it takes a few seconds to close the application compared with instantly by selecting Close application button on the application window.6. If you use mouse a lot while surfing internet, I do not recommend this mouse. You are not able to combine relaxing your palm on this mouse and using all 6 buttons at the same time."
5,ALL AROUND XLNT MOUSE!,PROS:xlnt qualitylong cordusb or ps2 connectionxlnt accuracyvery comfortable feeleasy access to side buttonsgreat gaming mouseaffordableCONS:nonethis is by far the best mouse i've ever owned bar none!
5,It works!,"I have tendonitis in my forearms, which seems to get aggravated by my job (computer work). I wear these bands when it acts up, and also when I'm doing activities that bother my tendonitis such as raking leaves or shoveling snow. Since using these bands, my tendonitis does not bother me much at all anymore. Highly recommend this product."
4,The Workin' Man,I actually bought this CD at a flea market. I love it! It has his good 'ol hits like Strangers and Sam Hill. I recomend you buy this.
4,More than a mere introduction to logic.,"Clark knew philosophy very well and knew logic better than most ever will. Yet he is able to write so that the beginner may understand. For the new student who has no instructor in logic, some sections will have to be read slowly several times. Clark was of the old school and expected the student to know more and to be able to better use his intellect than the average student today is able to do. This work is an excellent introduction which if carefully studied will put the reader far ahead of students using other texts. There is also a companion workbook available from the publisher although there are probably enough exercises given in the text by the author. Although both include glossaries of pertinent terms and use biblical examples, I believe this work is far superior to ""Come Let Us Reason,"" by Geisler and Brooks."
1,"A pretty dumb ""Smart"" remote","I bought the Logitech Harmony 880 Remote based on Logitech's Reputation as building good tech stuff. WOW, did I miss the boat on that one! The remote instructions are fairly straightforward, and all of that, and it seems easy to program, but the execution of the program is what stinks! THe remote has a hard time remembering when you have to alter a program after it is downloaded on to the remote. For example, it has a help screen that will walk thru the problem, but after you ""fix"" it that time, you have to ""fix"" it each time you use the remote. The Harmony 880 has now assumed a place of honor on the end table in the TV Room. It lives, undisturbed, beside the 4 remotes that it was supposed to replace, that we have come to depend on , again.....long story short, save your money, or find a better product! Wish I could send it back and get my 150 bucks back!"
4,Harmony 880 - Most Excellent,"I'm still happy with our Harmony 670, but the newly purchased 880 blows it away for many reasons...1) The color LCD is nice, much better than gray monochrome.2) The motion-activated backlight is *AWESOME*! No more fumbling and hunting for that dimly lit Glow or Light button - Just pick up the remote and on comes the backlight, generously illuminating the color LCD panel and doing a decent job of lighting the buttons as well.3) Rechargeable. Whether you're green, frugal or both, this is how it should be done. It's never ""died"", so I've no idea the remote's battery life, because it goes back on the charging cradle every night. The side effect of this is that the remote is usually very easy to find.4) It's sexy black and silver with blue backlight - perfect for my decor.5) More of the buttons I need for DVD, DVR, etc.Only four out of five stars, because even with the good sale Amazon had on them, these babies still ain't cheap."
3,Quite good but...,"This remote makes your life a lot easier, at least when you are relaxed just watching a movie or your favorite show. All that once you finish configuring it. The online-only configuration process is not as easy as Logitech tells you and most of the 150.000+ devices they have listed to auto-configure the remote are not fully programmed, so most likely you will end up configuring extra options your TV or DVD have. Another disadvantage I recently found is that the charging base does not always connects properly to the remote, specially when there's some dust over it. You have to be sure that the remote is charging and if not, clean both the bottom of the remote and the surface of the base. The reason of this is that the remote in not heavy enough to push itself against the base pin connectors but you can survive with this. Anyway, the remote fully charged (after 3 months of use) runs for up to 4 or 5 days without charging it again."
1,Buttons too small. Can't use by feel. Missing functions. Website hopeless. Slow.,"Despite Dell's $129 deal, I'm returning this remote. The buttons are way too small. You have to look at the remote to use it because there's little-to-no tactile feedback as to which button is which. Logitech's database of IR codes is missing functions, so you have to teach the remote. The website required to program the remote is slow and confusing. The remote has an annoying delay in sending signals, which I guess is programmable. Oi veh! Just how many hours are you supposed to spend setting up this remote!Logitech should do some usability studies instead of having their remotes designed by artists (it is pretty) and marketers. Starting with TiVo's peanut would be a good idea."
4,Harmony 880,"This remote is innovative. I believe that it is the best universal remote available. I like being able to program the remove via the internet. The size of the remote is great. However, the remote buttons are very small. They don't feel users friendly. The designed of the buttons and their location could be improved."
2,Not that great,I have had this remote for 2+ years.I will keep it simple.+ This is a very powerful tool able to do a lot.- The button layout is poor. We still have to look at the remote.- Using a computer interface to set-up is nice but not well implemented. There should be a novice and advanced mode. Using all the wizards all the time is a pain. The software doesn't work that well either. I can go through and program pages of extra buttons and hit DONE and it will not remember all the commands.I want a new remote to replace it but I'm afraid to go with another Harmony.
2,Awesome remote for the first 6months,I bought the Harmony 880 about a year ago. The first 6 months it worked perfect. After that the buttons slowly stopped working. First the heavly used buttons (volume +/- channel +/-) then the activity buttons and so on. When I am able to get one of the activity buttons to work it will only turn half my system on (tv will turn on but amp stays off). I just cant believe this is happening after paying $250 for a remote! If the proper durable hardware was used in this device this review would be 5 stars.
4,Good remote with minor issue,"I bought this remote to replace on that had too many steps involved for anyone other than myself to figure out how to use. The Harmony 880 makes things MUCH easier. The activities were pretty easy to set up and work like a charm. I like the motion activated light and the rechargeable batteries. I have not experienced the cradle issue so far, so perhaps this has been addressed. My only issue with this remote is the small buttons, but I have found it to be easier to operate than I anticipated when I first saw it."
5,the way remotes were meant to be,this is a great product. its a breeze to set up with the computer. all you have to do is answer a few basic questions and your are up and running. it can slo get into more complicated macros and programing learned ir codes for the more technical user. if you have multiple remotes that you have to use to do anything than this is the product for you.
5,Greatest remote,This remote is a must have for anyone that has a decent entertainment center! This is my second Logitech Harmony and I will continue to use these remotes.
3,"Almost perfect, but not quite..","I bought this for my boyfriends birthday. It got tired of him asking me to pass the remote and then telling me I passed the wrong one. In his room alone, he has 4 remotes. And the Logitech could control at least 8 items in his room. Including his xbox, his laptop, and his stereos.But the only thing it doesn't control is his TV. Apparently it doesn't work on radio waves, but ONLY on infrared.That kind of pissed me off.. We spent 4 hours trying to configure the buttons, but it still didn't work. And I'm pretty sure that he never uses it.. Which defeats the entire purpose..At least it was a good idea.."
5,Harmony 880,It is very convenient and easy to use. Better than using more than one remote. We had to have our son set it up after that it was easy using.
4,Almost perfect?,"Update 4/2008: I just loaded the latest version of software and the problems I was having with IR strength are GONE. Sweet!No doubt, there is no easier remote to program and integrate than the Harmony remotes.This specific model seems to have a weaker IR transmitter than the cheaper monochrome display Harmony remotes.The charging base is cumbersome--I even had someone make an off-color ""remote-cozy"" comment.Would have been 5 stars, but this is my second Harmony remote, and half of the time not all my components were getting turned on correctly, whereas before it was never a problem with the old Harmony. It could be a fluke, or more likely the earlier generation remotes had better quality components (my previous remote was a pre-logitech model.)"
3,Logitech 880,"This Logitech 880 is the third logitech remote that I have had. It is by far the best one so far. The ONLY complaint that I have is that the volume buttons must be pushed very hard for them to work. Other than that everything else works as it should. The docking cradle is great for recharging the batteries. It also made it much for my family to operate all the audio video equipment that I own. Programing all the logitech remotes is VERY easy and allot of fun, anyone can do it.Paul G."
5,Great Remote..Great Price!,"Got this today from Amazon at a great price ($100 below what you'll find in stores) and I set up my TV (Vizio), DVR (DirecTV) and DVD (Panasonic) and Receiver (Marantz) in about 15 minutes. The software to program the remote is brain dead and works great on my mac. You won't regret this purchase!"
5,Fantastic Product - From an audio/videophile,I've owned 3 other LCD screen universal remotes. This is the first one to actually exceed my expectations. Each of my 15 devices was in the Logitech database and all the remote functions were included out of the box.I had the whole system set up initially in 15 minutes and the process of editing your chained commands or new devices is a snap.Great product at a Great Price from Amazon.I'm very happy with this purchase.
4,good,"good looking remote , easy to usedI can add as many remote as I want toI bought a karaoke DVD player in Vietnam , I can't find a replacement remote control untill I found Harmony remote it work very very goodThanks Harmony"
4,Good remote with a few complaints...,"Pros:Was fairly easy to setup. It easily recognized my TV, A/V receiver, DVD player and Satellite box.Cons:The buttons feel cheap and don't have a good feel to it.Some of the buttons don't have good feedback.Does some unneeded stuff in the activities mode. For e.g. My TV is always set to a particular input (whether I am playing DVDs or watching Satellite TV). So there is no need to switch the TV's input. But it always does that in the activities mode.The other issue (and it is probably not something against the remote) is that in the activities mode, the remote powers on all my equipment needed for that activity. This takes a few seconds. Unfortunately if you happen to move the remote away from line of sight of all devices, all the commands might not complete and you may end up with some of the devices powered on and other still off.At this point you can no longer use activities, you have to go into the individual devices (device mode) and turn them on."
3,"Remote ""OK""","We were impressed with the capability and ease of programming the remote, but the bottons on this remote are very small are hard to operate with nails and ""without glasses""! We ultimately returned the remote and currently own Logitech #720....the buttons are bigger."
2,not worth $200 and overrated,first one did not charge up so had it exchanged.The 2nd one did work but not all functions like the Menu commands which I think are important.Tried to troubleshoot on web site and after about 5 hours was not successful setting it up the way I wanted.I have had other advanced universal remotes such as the Marantz 2000 and am pretty good with computers and electronics.... this remote is much overrated.I returned it today....
1,Flawed remote control,"The 880 assumes that the user is an idiot that does not know the difference between turning a TV on or Off. The controls are programmed so that, unless you follow the sequence dictated by the designer, some controls will not work. For example, you must press the All Off in order to be able to turn the TV back on after it was activated. So, if a command was not received by the TV (because of an obstruction, or your spouse used another controller), your 880 plays dead.It is the worst remote that I ever purchased, and I have a large number of them. Logitech support is not knowledgeable and really does not listen."
2,works well nightmare to set up,"This thing works great if you ever get it set up right. The start activity (arguably a very very important step) is horrible if you want to modify it. I had to delete a device in an activity and then reinstall it to change start up activity.I needed to change the settings on the receiver and the tv for roku box. Good luck. It is great if your are very electronically technical BUT if you are not, get ready for some choice works.Help is extensive, not that helpful."
2,Ok but not great.,"I purchased the 880 Logitech Harmony about 3 years ago. The first couple of years, this remote is fantastic. Setup is easy and the remote is very sleek and appealing to the eye. The remote is light and really easy to use. Operationally, the remote never failed.The only issue is that the remote is not very durable. The buttons (especially the ones you use often) begin to fail after a while. The buttons simply stop working or you have to press really hard to the button to function. After a while, you will notice more and more of the buttons start to fail.You can program different buttons on the remote to function in place of the malfunctioning button but this becomes a hassle after a while.On the positive side, Logitech realizes that this is a major issue with the 880 and will give you a 50% off coupon for the purchase of another unit. It's not the greatest customer support but it's something.Overall good but does not last."
4,So far so good,No major complaints. Have not had the charging issue that some of the other reviewers have mentioned. I liked it enough that I actually bought a second one as a gift.
5,Best remote yet!,"I've had this remote for a month now, and it has been working great. The only promblem is that it occasionally repeats a command as if I'm holding a button down (only with my cable box for some reason), but, I've had a couple of other Harmony remotes that have done the same thing. Just I quirk I suppose. Other than that, which I can live with, it's been the best remote yet. It's easy to use, and I just transferred my settings from the remote I had been using to this one. It took all of two minutes to set up initially, and then just a few minutes more to customize the extra buttons. Would I recommend this product...? Absolutely."
4,Nice product . . .,Would buy again.Pros- Works as described- Set up is easy (albeit a little clumsy)- Charger/docking stationCons- Remote layout not as good as a TiVo remote (but adequate)
1,Lasted 3 months,"Bought this remote expecting great things. Have bought logitech products in the past and been very happy with them. This remote was no different for the first 3 months. Worked great, fairly easy web based setup great form factor and looks good. However 3 months in the 5 button stopped working. I rebooted the remote to factory settings and reloaded my button setup from this logitech wizard. Worked for a couple weeks then stopped again.The most disappointing part is that when I Emailed Logitech and Amazon with receipts/order #'s etc and asked them how to fix the issue or if it was a defect and received no response from either. I couldn't be more disappointed in the lack of support from both sides on what could have been a great product."
1,Dont buy,"I bought and returned this remote. I tried to make it work. It did well in creating all activities DVD, VCR, Radio, PVR, DISH but failed to goto right panasonic TV input. Spent total of 12hrs. Email support from logitect is useless. I recommend not buy it rather use time to program existing remote for multiple devices."
5,Great Product - Great Price - Fast Delivery!,"This remote is by far one of the greatest remotes available to the general public. With one button, I can turn on everything needed to watch tv, listen to music, watch dvds. I love it. I ordered this product on a Friday, and received it the following Tuesday... I'm telling you, you'll look forward to going home, kissing your wife and kids, and holding your remote everyday after work..."
1,Could not get it to work soo I sent it back,Could not get it to work soo I sent it back. I had it for a month and talked to the Teck's 5 or 6 times and they could never get all the buttons to work. Would not reccomend it.
2,Difficult,Many people have difficulty programming this. I did not. I do have trouble using it. It only works about 75% of the time. Everytime you turn your components on it seems to have to re-learn the commands. Many buttons are small and I find myself hitting two buttons at once allot. Had higher expectations. Would not recommend atany price.
1,Sent it back after a week,"Oh how I wanted this remote to work. I so love the concept of a truly universal remote and thought this was ""the one."" But it was outrageously difficult to use even for a techie like me."
1,So far..... no remote,"I am completely unsatisfied with this product. Just received it and the AC adapter is not working after a couple of minutes once is plugged to an electrical outlet. Got it shipped overseas from Amazon and Logitech doesn't have a representation office in this country. Probably would need to buy an AC adapter from an electronics store.... hope this works. This is not right for a $150 universal remote. I believe that I am with the 0.00005% of Logitech users that has this problem; Logitech is known for quality in their products so this is really shocking. As soon as I got this remote working, probably would rate it again."
2,Designed to Last About 3 Years,"I purchased this remote in approximately 2008.Problem 1: The charging cradle this remote comes with is worthless because the connections do not meet properly. About once a week you will have to go through a painstaking process of angling the cradle and remote just perfectly to get the connections to meet, and then hope a bump or gust of wind does not mess it all up.Problem 2: The buttons are cheap. After about a year, several of the number buttons stopped working. Since I mostly use the on-screen menu, I could live with this. After 3 years, the volume buttons stopped working completely. Customer support sends you to India, tells you all you need to know about their ability to help.Problem 3: There are really no other manufacturers of universal remotes other than Logitech. Every remote has problems, but it appears they are only designed to last about 3 years based on other reviews. I will probably try the Harmony One next due to no other feasible choices."
4,Good remote - for 3 years,"I bought this remote 3 years ago on an Amazon Black Friday deal. I was worried about the charger issues, but the deal was too good to pass up. Luckily I had very few issues, with the 3-contact version of the charger. There were just a couple times that the charger would beep for no apparent reason. There are plenty of reviews regarding all the pros and cons. I wanted to add a note about the longevity. It's been a great remote for almost 3 years, but now there's probably 1/2 a dozen buttons that no longer work. The most annoying being the volume and mute buttons. This remote has been great but it's reached the end of its lifetime."
2,Swollen batteries and broken battery doors,"Both of these remotes have had swollen batteries eventually breaking the tabs off of the battery door which causes the remote not to charge. Logitech's response, order new batteries and battery doors. Very disappointed in Logitech! Will consider another company' product in the future."
2,Great Features - Poor Charger,"My family and I are extremely happy with the layout and features of this remote.However, we are on our second remote because the first suddenly refused to recharge. Now our second remote is suffering the same fate. The remote becomes more and more difficult in placing it upon the charger in just the right position so that it will charge. If the second follows the pattern of the first, this will become more and more difficult until the remote finally refuses to charge."
2,Received Defective Product,"The cradle did not charge the battery although there was a blue light on the cradle indicating tha power was going thru it. The set up was easy but I expect to receive products that have been tested and work. Logitech tech support was no help, they recommended that I clean the contacts, wiggle the remote on the cradle and press it down to make sure it made contact. What about that I have to waste my time on addressing their faulty hardware design. It is a shame because the product software works great and is easy to set up. Great software design, atrocious hardware design and implementation ."
1,Not Good Value,"I purchased the Logitech Harmony for my wife. You know I'm in touble now. She has no patience with most remotes so I thought this would be a good idea. How do you think I justified the expenditure? ""Watch TV"" seemed like a simple enough selection.It hasn't worked out that way. The Harmony has tiny cheesey buttons and one button just doesn't do it all. It seems to forget things and will, for example, fail to turn on the TV before selecting an input source. You can go back online and troubleshoot the problem, which is fun for us geeks, but wives of geeks aren't amused.My son thinks it is great! Of course now you are talking about son of geek so what would you expect? Personally I feel that performance and construction just don't meet my expectations for something this expensive. Sony sells a nice one for about $20."
2,not universal in electronics it can control,"I was looking forward to the new remote as I have an older model I use occassionally. I had hoped it had vastly improved the older model. I went to program my new Sharp HD TV's remote unfortunately, it did not have the programming for it unless you copied it one to another. It only picked up some of the buttons not all of the TV's original remote. For the money they wanted for this unit it should have all the remotes programmed in advance for downloads and not have to ""gerry rig"" it for it to function. Sadly, I returned it immedialtely.Mike"
4,"Great remote, even better customer service","I love my Harmony 880 remote. It has greatly simplified control of my main ""home theater"" -- there is one button each to watch TV, anther for TV with Stereo, Watch DVD, Watch VCR, Play CD, etc. Although I am a gadget freak, I bought this so my ""better half"" can easily control my system, even when I upgrade components.Setup had a few snags, but Harmony phone support was great, quickly fixing my online account, and showing me where to download updated software. When I had a charging problem, I sent them an e-mail and received a newly designed charger base (at no cost) which works great, and it was received in only a few days!Configuration and tweaking the setup online take a little skill and some patience, but the result is well worth it."
2,880 Remote,"The buttons are way too small - difficult to see in dim light. THis loses its funtionality, and therefore its value. Programming is very easy, and the concept is really good. The specific design is extremely weak."
5,Simply Amazing,"I do software engineering for work... I never have trouble with electronics... My wife teaches Kindergarten... she LOVES this remote!The simplicity, the 'help' option... it's fantastic. Getting ""codes"" via the computer simplifies the entire process...Everything simply works. Also the ease of customizing and essentially having unlimited custom buttons is fantastic...I highly recommend this product and will only buy Harmony remotes in the future."
2,All you new owners talk to me in a year,"My review would have been five stars when I first purchased this remote. Great functionality, easy to program, easy to use.Six months after buying, my remote stopped charging, and the contacts were corroded. 3 years and five replacements later I am out of warranty and out of luck. I have tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol, and the ""folded paper trick"" with no avail. The redesigned charger made no difference.Check the forums, you'll see I'm not alone.Buyer beware."
2,Poor ergonomics.,"Ok, so it looks good. However, the buttons are small and hard to see in the dark and you can't adjust the backlight level. Also, the cradle is very picky and doesn't charge without tilting.On the plus side, it's fairly easy to set up. However, for the price, it left me wanting more."
4,Almost the best thing you can give your media center,"I bought one of these for myself last year, and gave my brother-in-law one this year. We both have your typical home media setup -- TV, Amplifier, DVD-player, and other things. It uses ""activities"" as a way to turn on all the needed devices, and switch the TV and Amplifier to the correct settings. If you want to have one remote to control it all, you need one of these. Harmony uses your computer and internet connection to program the remote with everything needed for your various devices. If the software doesn't know about your weird old DVD player, you can use the old remote to train this one. Or buy a new DVD player...I have a few gripes about it -- I can arrange the order of activities on the LCD screen, but not the devices. The software works better on PC than Mac, but latest versions work okay. A plus is the form -factor -- it has that cool TIVO-remote fit."
5,Perfect,"I have a Sharp Aquos 1080p, Sony 6.1 Surround, and digital HD DVR with Comcast. This remote works will all of those. In fact, it does stuff with the TV that the TV's original remote couldn't do like instantly go to a specific video input without having to scroll through all of them. The battery life is great too as it rarely needs recharging. I highly recommend this remote."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"I recently purchased a Harmony 880. I tried to set it up and the instructions do not make any sense. I finally got through to their support people and have been on the phone with them the past 3-4 nights for at least 2 hours each night and no one has been able to get this to work. They have Tier 2 help but you must threaten to kill someone( just kidding???) before they will put you through to them, and then you will be on hold again.Save yourself a lot of aggravation. 3 remotes are a nuisance but nothing is as bad as this"
4,Nice Remote,Everything I expected and more. Clear and crisp lcd screen and very easy to use. The only downfall is that the volume button sticks and instead of changing volume one notch it ends up being 3 or more notches. Other than that it is a great product. Very Happy
5,One of the Best Universal Remotes,"Set-up was a breeze. It does take some time to key in all your components, but once you're done, it's easy as can be. Doesn't take a tech genius to do this. Would have gone for the 890, but cost is so much more for IR feature and backlight. Remote is comfortable, and rechargeable batteries are a definite plus. Logitech has every one of my devices, even for my A/V switch which caused me some concerns, but Logitech had it. Much better than I hoped. Wife loved the simplicity of the remote. One-button push much easier to turn on devices. I currently have 9 programs for this remote. Absolutely love this remote. Can't live without it now."
4,Univeral Remote,Very convenient to have only one remote. Easy to use. If anything doesn't work properly the help button is SUPER EASY and helpful. Works all the features on the TV including On Demand. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their 50 remotes.
4,I love it but not for everyone,"If you are a tech savvy person, understand your entertainment system very well, and know how to use a computer this is a great device. I have a full entertainment system with 5 different devices (HDTV, Audio Receiver, DVD Player, DVR and DVD Recorder) and this remote really makes my life easier. In fact, my wife also loves using it! Unfortunately, you have to take a little time to learn how to use it. It's a very user-friendly device (button could be bigger) but the software is not very intuitive. Fortunately, Logitech completely revamped their software now (version 7) and it's far better than what it shipped with.If you can build an entertainment system from scratch and you know the difference between a component and a composite cable, this remote will work well for you. Otherwise, this may not be the proper device for you (unless you have someone who could help you)."
3,Is A Nice Toy,Is a nice toy but after a while the simple remote that cam with your TV or satellite receiver is much simpler to use and will do most of the function of this one. I can tell you that the web site is pretty user friendly and the remote is easy to customize. Otherwise a great replacement for all the remotes in your house if that is what is what you are looking for.
3,"convenient, but hard to hold","For such an expensive item, I think this should have been designed more ergonomically. Using the number pad is difficult and the remote slips out of my and my husband's hand. It is nice to have all of our media functions in one remote though, but I'm wondering if there is a better product out there."
2,Disappointed,Trying to deal with Customer Servce at Logitech is not satisfying. I tried to deal with a problem for 2 weeks and never got closure. If I were to consider purchasing it again-considering hindsight-I would not.I finally got the problem solved the third week. It was something the first person I talked to should have known.
3,Great Until The Bar=ttery Needs Replacing...,"Our Logitech remote could only be described as ""amazing"" until the rechargeable battery would no longer take a charge. The set-up, operation, functionality, and intuitive operation made this without doubt the ""best"" piece of our home theater. This all changed when the rechargeable battery would no longer accept a charge from its cradle some months back. Since then we have ordered, reordered, and then reordered again the replacement battery sold on Amazon (and other sites). It is apparently unavailable anywhere. While we loved the operation and simplicity of this gadget, it is a bit expensive to lump into the ""disposable"" category because replacement rechargeable batteries are not being made available by Logitech. Bottom line: great unit initially but short life span makes it impractical as battery will eventually need replacing and replacement rechargeable batteries are just not available."
2,Quirky Remote,The remote works well when it works. It is difficult to charge and keep on the base correctly. It constantly beeps when it is out of alignment and begins to lose it's charge. I believe that this is a frequent complaint.
4,"Great job, tackling an incredibly challenging need","A great product, in concept, though my wife says it denies her of the challenge of using the 3 remotes with which she had struggled and I had juggled. With three devices, setup went like a breeze, except for somewhat vague instructions on programming a ""soft"" (on-screen) key; programming hard buttons was very easy, with a convenient, well-designed (on-computer) user interface. Adding a fourth device proved challenging, due to the idiosyncracies of our (Panasonic) flat screen display related to switching inputs to accommodate a non-HD DVD player. I was able to devise a solution, however, without Logitech support, who might have known of the issue. Buttons are a little small when using, but manageable."
4,Logitech Harmony,"Good product and haven't had any malfunctions yet. If you are on the wrong video input or if tv isn't on, just click ""help"" and it will fix it for you by answering some yes-or-no questions. I have 6 or 7 things connected to the tv so its really nice not having a remote for each one."
4,Gets the job done,"Great product, except for a couple of issues (minor really.)1. The Tivo button placement can remain confusing when compared to the standard remote it replaces (skip back, rewind, and fast forward and jump to end buttons are a little confusing in location.)2. The programming software is totally controlled online from the Logitech site, which is often frustrating as you have to wait for updates to occur without any visual cues as to progress. Once you have completed your first round of programs, you don't have to worry about mods unless you buy new equipment, then you can easily update your equipment lists and activities.Very hard to get off the proper programming track you must follow when setting up the remote for the first time. On the good side, it is very logical in its process of stepping you through the programming control requirements."
3,Logitech Harmony 880,"Here is my feedback with regards to this device:Pros:- Ability to set up activities easily by utilizing the website instructions.- Recognizes most additional devices (V, dvd players, pvrs)- Rechargeable batteries.Cons:- Crowded buttons. Hard to use the PVR features (ff, RW). Hard to type channels. Not very intuitive to touch. You have to look at what you are typing.- Noticeable delays when typing channels or commands."
5,MY SECOND UNIVERSAL REMOTE BY LOGITECH,"I just couldn't be happier with my Logitech remote. It controls my four units with ease and my wife enjoys it even though she is far from liking ""electronic things."" Our first identical remote began being unresponsive to the volume and mute buttons. I attribute that to the heavy pressing by my wife which probably wore out the contacts. So, I just bought another almost four years later. I wouldn't be without this marvelous remote."
3,Requires a lot of customization,"This remote is supposed to be easy to configure and use. With my modest TV, DVD, DirecTV, and sometimes PC input configuration, it took a few frustating hours to get it to work the way I wanted.For some reason, the software refuses to recognize the ""TV"" input as an input. So when programming the 880 to toggle between my TV, DVD, and DirecTV receiver, the input selection keeps being off by 1. The only work-around I found was to program a fake input at the top of the input list to make the programming work correctly.Another annoyance is that when the remote looses its signal, it just assumes all the devices are turned off even when they are on. There is no fix for this. You have to use the ""Help"" key to force the shutdown of all the devices (interupting what you are currently doing), and then re-start your activity.Overall, I still like this remote because I do like that I can control multiple devices with just one remote. But it is not worth the $100+ I paid for it."
5,Harmony 880 brings Harmony to my house,This is a super universal remote. This is the ticket to control all of your AV needs. Very easy to use and set up.
4,Great remote,I have had this remote for over a month now and it is great. Works all me equipment pefectly. I did not find the set up hard at all. Just think about how you want to set it up and your good. The only con I have is that the buttons could be laid out a little better. It is not as intuitive as my Dish Network remote as far as lay out. But it is not a major concern. All of the buttone light up so it is easy to use in the dark. Yes you might have to look at the buttone for a couple of weeks to use some of them but I find that the case with all new remotes. I only look down at the remote when I use a button I usually never use. Get this remote you will not be disappointed.
4,Pretty good remote,"Pros: It does everything it is supposed to do. Easy to program and what a great remote to be able to push one button and turn 3 to 5 units on and all of the correct setting for each. And when I am getting sleepy at the end of the evening, to be able to pick up just one remote and push one button to turn everything off. Wow.Cons: The buttons for such things as pause, stop, start, etc. are not easy to find in the dark. Those buttons should be easier to find by feeling."
5,Fantastic device,"This a very nice remote. Once you program it, it works flawlessly. So easy to use even my mother loves it. My problem was the number of devices. DVD plaver, VCR, dish network, direct tv (with DVR), cable, receiver & TV. Instead of 7 remotes I have 1 now. Not to mention the hassle of changing the inputs on multiple devices. I used to have to do it for my mom every time she wanted to watch something. Now, its a breeze...I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a lot of components."
4,"Good, but Not Great For TiVo","This remote does everything I need it to do, but there are two things that cause me to choose the Logitech Harmony 670 over the 880: #1) The remote buttons do not stand out to your feel because they do not protrude from the surface of the remote. This requires looking at the remote rather than just using your touch. I admit, though, the glow-on-pickup feature helps with this, but I still have to look at the remote and #2) the 670 has dedicated TiVo-centric buttons around the 5-way navigator that helps PVR users such as myself. Other than that, it works great. But I chose to use the 670 and gave the 880 to a friend."
5,Excellent,"Battery lasts plenty long, and I've dropped this twice from a distance of 5 feet, and it still works great...Simple set up, works everything great...If only it worked for the Wii..."
4,Outstanding,"I've had a few ""universal"" remotes in the past and without exception, they were very difficult to get configured correctly.I just purchased the Harmony 880 and I'm already amazed at how easy it is to set up and use. Configuration was a breeze and it works exactly as advertised. I highly recommend this remote."
1,Too many hoops to jump through,"This remote is just a pain from the start. First off, you can't do anything to it, not even turn it off, without programming it from the computer. Second, you can't program it from the computer without installing thier software. Third, you cant use thier software without making a user account. Forth, you cant make a user account without giving them a bunch of personal information.This is where I draw the line. I'm not trying to get a home loan, I'm just trying to get my TV to turn on, and the remote to turn OFF. I have to give up my personal info to program a damned remote??? To hell with that, and to hell with ths remote."
4,Jimmy Buffett,Jimmy Buffett has been performing a lllooonnnggg time-music is folks personal taste-so- the cd worked & the music worked too. But tunes & explore!
5,Winner watch,"I have worn this same model for more than 20 years. Originally bought at Narita of US$29.00. It has never failed me and every 5 years or so I change the battery.Therefore, I was thrilled to find the same watch for $17.77 at Amazon.The watch is a comfortable, convenient, attractive and highly reliable timepiece.I can imagine why anyone needs more.Arthur"
5,Excellent watch! great to drive peopl nuts!,Wear this watch to an old sports bar on Sunday afternoon while superbowl is playing. Change the channel to QVC just before a touchdown.....oh the entertainment!
5,Merle Haggard and the Texas Playboys at their Best,"I've had this album for 15 years, and it continues to be one of my favorites. Merle always wanted to be a Texas Playboy, and here he finally got his chance. He made the most of it, with backing by some of the best to ever play with Bob Wills, many of whom have since passed on. The Playboys brought musicianship to country music, much as Steely Dan did to rock many years later. Here they are at their best, and Merle Haggard was a perfect fit."
4,Memory quality,"CF Memory is good for my aplications, for example, I extend my Zaurus storage capacity, I have a multi memory reader and I used to backup my data on CDROM or CDRW, now I can use my CF memory.Finally, I have only one objection: The size of this memory is less than a 1Gb , is 987Mb aprox."
5,work great,"This item works great i bought this in for my nikon d100 in a pinch, becasue the micodrive i got didnt work, this worked flawlessly and has ever since i should buy a few more..."
3,Hope it could be faster,"I have CF cards from other manufacturer, including Viking.Two things I noticed:1)It used up the battery faster than other CF.2)Response time to write is slower than others, so it is good for still pictures. I missed quite a few good picture moment for my 3 years old son as he played."
5,How to Subdue Impending Road Rage,"Prayer: A Windham Hill Collection (CD)by Michael ManringIf you're a high-strung person like me, I recommend this beautiful, gentle, instrumental music that is both soothing and emotionally engaging, yet never maudlin. It has been a ""God-send"" while driving in heavy morning rush-hour traffic. Despite all the aggravations caused by socially-challenged drivers who don't know how to share the road, I find that I still arrive at work calm and centered thanks to the beneficial effects of this masterful Windham Hill CD. After weeks of listening to it every single morning, it's still not boring. I strongly recommend it for Type A personalities!"
5,Panasonic Anniversary Canister Edition 2010,"I have purchased vacuum bags from GoVacuum for many months. Each time I receive the bags their service is incredibly fast, the product is pristine and it does the job.I highly recommend GoVacuum for all your vacuum bag needs."
2,Not sturdy enough for a 3-4 month old!,"I got this swing for a shower gift. It was okay when my baby was newborn, she just laid there. But as she got older she showed no interest in it, acted like she couldnt see the mirror and the toys were hard to get to. And the worst part was by 3 months old she was almost to big for it, she kept leaning back like she was going to fall out backwards head first so she didnt like it and by 4 months(12lbs) she refused to stay in it. When I put her in it, the swing would lean so far back, I thought she was going to tump it over. Good swing for newborn to maybe 2 months, but not sturdy enough for any older babies. It does fold up and store nice though."
2,More like a rocker,"I found this swing to be very easy to set up and convienent, however, my baby hates it! It's more like a rocker and less like a swing. It swings very slow and the back and forth motion is short. I thought that he wouldn't know the difference, but he certainly does!"
2,Didn't like swing,The swing made my daughter sit way too upright. She just didn't like it and it seemed to go too fast.
