1,What the heck?,"It has been a while since I wasted my money on this DVD, but I'm still not entirely sure what I saw. I'm not sure if it was the silver-painted faces, the thick accents or the video effects that ruined it for me, but the information contained in this DVD is so hard to follow or extract for personal use that i can't possibly recommend it to anyone!I consider myself to have at least a somewhat open mind, but I still can't wrap my head around the shear silliness of the DVD. It is neither science nor spirituality, in my opinion."
3,"A useful reference, but surprisingly lacking in some areas.","Overall, this book provides the reader with a good reference to the basic Win32 API's, and I use it frequently in my work. The sample code is good overall, although I have found a few examples that are in error. The biggest disapointment, however, is that the book completely omits a reference section for the Windows messages -- something that was included in the old Windows 3.1 API Bible and should have been in this one as well."
2,Wrong COLOR!!! PLEASE CHANGE,"Do not order this pan unless you check out the picture and make sure it is the purple one advertised on the site. I ordered it thinking I was getting the purple pan and got the burgandy looking pan....I am a purple lover not a burgandy lover. I went to T-Fal site to figure it out- THE PLUM is the purple color and the GRAPE is a burgandy color. on top of that AMAZON has a couple of these pans misadvertised, making it worse. So order plum if you want purple. I sent the grape back and got the plum and now I am very happy!!!"
2,NOT made from real sheepskin,"The only part of these slippers that contains sheepskin is the exterior cuff. The upper interior is made from wool (not nearly as soft) and the interior footbed is made from cheap synthetic acrylic. Sent these back for a refund.You can find much higher quality 100% real sheepskin slipper, almost identical in design to these for only $10 more at a store that rhymes with Kabelas. (Amazon automatically deletes my reviews when I spell the name of the store with a ""C"")"
4,Wonderful,"NIce slipper, looks sturdy and cozy. I have not given them to my husband yet as they are a gift.Thats the only reason I gave them a 4 dont know how they will wear.They look and feel fabulous."
5,Great slippers!,My husband always wears high-top slippers. I decided to try to buy from someone else. These are truly wonderful -- great value for a very good price. Most important was the sole so he can wear them outside. They arrived quickly. Can't wait for him to open them on Christmas.
5,These are the perfect slippers!,"I got these for my husband and he just loves them! They are comfortable, warm and very cozy! They are very well made and I would highly recommend them!"
1,Bummer order,It is a fine looking picture. Unfortunately this is not what I received in the mail. My order was messed up totally and I ended up sending the product back for a full refund. Had I actually gotten the product I ordered I imagine I would have been much happier.As it is I have placed a similar order from a company I have used before and I do not anticipate any problems.
4,So Cozy and Comfy!,"My husband bought me these for Christmas--yes I know they are Men's, but I have a larger foot and the reviews for the ladies one said they ran really small, so I told him to order the mens slipper in size 9--I run a size 11 in slippers--anyway, these fit perfectly! They are so warm and the sole is great, I've worn them all around town and even in snow and my feet haven't gotten wet. You can wear them cuffed up or down--I wear it up to keep my ankles warm and no need for socks-my feet stay nice and warm and dry. I got them in the Rootbeer color--it looks black online, but it's a deep dark brown. Definitely give these a shot, they are great"
5,Slipper,Perfect for me. Comfy and they keep my feet warm while I walk outside to get my morning paper.
4,Toast to You,"Although there were a few broken glasses and stems,the champagne glasses were received in the time specified. I would certainly order from this vendor/company again!"
1,No fun if it won't run,"I've had a real challenge installing this program and to date still don't have it running. The company is sending me a replacement for disc 2, so we shall see if that is a fix. I have a friend who loves that game."
2,looks bad,"i'm looking for a bass amp, and this kind of amp doesn't look like a one that can do 150 watts. It looks cheaply built just like the other reviewer wrote..i'll look around more"
3,Creative and Fun,"I found this book creative and fun. It is actually three vignettes or novellas based around the crew of the Starrunner. It is an easy read, and has lots of sexy action and adventure. A good escapist fantasy."
4,"Bewarned very, very spicy","I actually really liked this book. But for those of the faint of heart or those expecting her Jane's Warlord this book is very spicy. She uses explicit language and explicit sexual situations. Also, this book is mostly about BDSM - (very tastefully done). I think you'll really enjoy this."
1,Who's Snitchin' Who's Lyin',"This is the Worst home Made HipHop related DVD I have ever seen.It is a complete waste of Time viwieng and Even a bigger waste of Cash.All speculation and no concrete evidence, regurging all old news with absolutely nothing new.The Game does not expose anything on this one as he had claimed he would.Ever since being dropped flat on his back from G-Unit The Game has been struggling to remain in the Lime light.and with this DVD he is basically scratching his knuckles on the road for cash.Nothing but self accolades and pumping his own ego up.What as waste of time as every one know's that 50 Cent made this guy and he is still hurting from being dropped.Forget the Hype - The Game is over"
3,You can definitely spend less for quality batteries.,"I've bought Energizer replacement rechargeable batteries for both my S30 and my digital video camera and have found them to actually hold a longer charge and a longer battery life than the originals that came with the cameras. The going rate for the Canon NB-2L seems to be from $50 - $70. You can get the Energizer equivalent for $27 at one of my favorite sites. It's definitely not a generic and considering what Canon is charging for theirs, I consider it a no-brainer. I've never had any problems with the non-OEM batteries I've used, but I've never used generic batteries either.By the way, I love my S30 and consider it one of the best buys I've ever made in my life. I've had it over 2 years now and the picture quality it produces still amazes me."
3,They just don't last.,Okay - even the original battery doesn't last very long. While they charge fairly quick I'd rather they took longer to charge and worked longer. Even with a spare you're not going to last all day taking lots of shots with even two batteries.While it is not the batteries fault it is still a problem I think they won't solve soon. Had I known beforehand that the Canons ate so much battery life so quickly I would have purchased a different camera. I can't fill my 128 MB stick with the use of a single battery.So if you like to travel and go on hikes etc. where weight is important I would highly recommend finding a camera that doesn't eat batteries like they were candy. The camera is light enough but the batteries are inefficient and you need to take a fully charged army of them with you on a back country trip adding a lot of un-needed weight.
1,hard to say,"It's hard to say because after waiting three weeks for it to be delivered, I got an email saying that it was no longer being carried by the supplier but that I could by it from another supplier for an extra ten dollars."
4,perfect,"Well, maybe not PERFECT. But pretty damm good. My girlfriend gave this to me because she knows how much java I drink and I must say this guy captures why I love coffee - the buzz, the cafes and people you meet. Not that I've met art smugglers, pirates and witchdoctors, as he apparently has, but then I haven't traveled halfway round the world. It's a great idea, to follow coffee's route and combine travel and history like this. I read the whole book in a day and loved it. A bibliogrpahy would have been nice."
1,Do Not Buy This Crappy Piece of Trash!!!,"I picked up one of these units at Walmart. Had to take it back because it didn't work. Got a duplicate replacement. It worked for 3 hours. The antennae is crap, the electronics are stale crap. It's too light to use as a boat anchor. If you buy this unit, you have truly wasted $20. You've been warned!"
5,lots of playtime,"This was a great toy. The coffee maker makes coffee maker noises and the kids serve me coffee. The hand mixer really turns and the kids made all kinds of play soup with it. The prongs of the mixer are very bendy and also stop when little fingers examine them, so it seems quite safe. We got a year of hard play out of the hand mixer before the prongs wouldn't turn any more, but they loved it so much that I am going to buy another one this year."
5,"It works, don't know what else to comment on","This is memory that just pops right in. So, not sure what more to say."
1,item defective and I am having problems returning it. PC,"The product does not work. It is defective, and I am having problems with PC universe.Not happy. They said they would send me RMA by Jan 14th and still nothing."
5,Awesome Quality RAM and Great Price,Corsair is always known for it's quality products and that's why I buy them. I own their PSU which is awesome and I also own this RAM which is rock solid stable. I have my E6300 at a 62% overclock and it is perfectly stable. Passed Prime95/Intel Burn-in tests. Also you can't beat the price with the mail-in rebate. I will always recommend Corsair products. Never had any fail on me.
5,Corsair XMS2,What can I say it's a great product for gaming and for a fast pc. Running 8gigs of ram really helps me playing all my games without any problems.
1,Not working with Intel DG45ID MB,"The first Set of TWIN2X4096-6400C5 modules died after a few days and the second set is very unstable on my Intel DG45ID motherboard.I get the ""Dreaded Blue Screen"" about 2 times a day (or more). I ran MEMTEST86+ and did not have to wait very long for errors. Every pass through the test failed!On Corsair's forum, the RAM GUY seems to think these are 1.9 volt modules and the intel motherboard selects 1.8v by default.I am still waiting for a resolution from Corsair!"
5,100% satisfied,"I did my research on HD before I bought this TV and it payed off. If you are looking for HD viewing without breaking the bank then this is a good option. Samsungs' DLP tvs look great in light or dark rooms. The image quality is superb, the HD channels make it hard to get off the couch and walk away. The black levels are fantastic and the colors really pop. It has enough inputs to satisfy almost everyone, and the picture and sound customization options should keep you happy.For bang for your buck there isn't a better deal out there right now.As for the difference between this TV and a 1080p.. most of the technology for sources hasn't reached 1080p anyways. (over the air signals, cable and satellites max out at 1080i) unless you are watching HD DVD's or Blu-Ray discs, chances are you won't even be able to tell the difference with your naked eye."
3,"Samsung HLT5675S 56"" Slim 720p DLP HDTV","TV is very light and it almost looks like an LCD or HD TV. The only complaint I have is that image is grainy so unless you plan on getting HD DT or Digital TV the image quality isn't that great. I have some channels that do get 1080i signal however the image quality still isn't up to par with other TV's that have higher contrast ratio. But then again I can't complain because I only got this 56"" for only $899 TOTAL!!!"
3,Nice HD - Poor Analog and Defective,"I took advantage of the great $989 bargain on this set. After having a smaller 32"" LCD TV, the HDTV picture wasn't nearly as sharp but was ""ok"" (rate it an 8 on a scale of 10). Analog was just horrible - ranging from 2 to 4 on a scale of 10 as opposed to my LCD which is perhaps a 6. In part this could be from simply blowing up a televised bad picture to a large size. My Samsung 56"" also has a 2"" circular smudge on the lower part of the screen which I guessing may be caused by contamination during the assembly process (like a fingerprint on the inner screen). Regretfully, I'm returning this TV for a refund. If you have local HDTV network channels and are able to stay away from analog, this is a very nice large screen television with a decent high definition picture."
1,Don't buy this case,"I bought this case a year ago on Amazon, and I haven't used it very much. It is very poorly made. I had it on my belt a few days ago, the belt strap came off (threads unraveled) and the case with camera went flying to the pavement. Luckily, the camera survived. The top row of threads came off, and bottom row was very loose."
2,Buy Canon SC-PS900 Case Instead !!!,"I agree with other reviewers' sentiment about the lack of attention given to this carrying case. The Canon S70 is a High-End Point-and-Shoot. Canon should make a case that is as well-thought as their Canon S60/S70 cameras. What irks me is that they do(!). However, it is NOT SOLD IN THE USA! Do a Google search for ""Canon SC-PS900"". The SC-PS900 Canon Camera Case is well-padded and has pockets for 2 Additional Compact Flash Cards and also for a Spare Battery (which is a necessity with this camera). I got mine on eBay. I wish I could have bought it on Amazon or any U.S. retailer. I'm not trying to be racist (as I'm Asian) but C'mon Canon - sell the SC-PS900 Case in the U.S. too!"
1,The Egypt Game,"For a school project every person in my grade had to read The Egypt Game. It is a boring little book that has too much content for it's own good. A couple times we had to read this in class I got in trouble for falling asleep. This book insults the intellegence of kids just learning to read. Don't waste your time or money on this book. If you don't beleive me check the book out of the library, but don't read it somewhere that if you fall asleep you might get hurt."
1,This Book Stinks!!,"The Egypt Game is a story about 6 kids who decide it would be fun to pretend that they are magical Egyptians. They think all is well,until terrorstrikes out in egypt . Will egypt be able to survive? Well, to find out you would have to read the book,which I don't recommend. Unless,you like reading boring books. At first, it ws slow, and I thought it would get better.It didn't. This book is not good at all. Don't spend your time and money on this book. DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"It was a pretty good book and very imaginative, but I agree with a previous review: it contains alot of false god worshipping and other heathen stuff like that. Of course, it's just a game and all in good fun, right? All I'll say is, you have to decide. I just didn't really look at it too much. It's still a good read, though."
3,"An okay story, but poor as a reference for Egypt","In school, we had to read this as a background for studying Egypt, and even though it was a better homework assignment than worksheets, I didn't learn anything. The first chapter spent more time on eyelashes than plot or characters, and the information on Egypt basically consisted of what these kids thought up, elaborating on real research. But the idea was interesting enough for me--a fourth grader--to collect a few Egyptian-looking items, set up my own Egypt Game, and get a few extra credit points. Basically, it's a great idea, with mediocre research, characters and writing."
1,Sketchy at Best,"Don't waste your money. This book assumes that you already know all about Egypt and are very excited about all the rites, objects of worship, etc. It also leaves a lot of the details of the game itself to the reader's imagination. This book is best for a teacher seeking ideas on how to set up a game for children to play after they've finished a unit on Egypt. Then again, it tries to incorporate a plot into the sketch of a game. ..."
1,"Children, guard your minds","This book caught my attention because we are studying Egypt. Instead of an insightful, thought provoking fiction, it proved to be a negative inticement for young readers. Children, be careful what you read and what you watch. Being intrigued by the darker side of things is understandable, but it is dangerous and unwise. My concern is that our society is embracing what my generation would never have tolerated. It is not the book itself that is so scarry, but it is that parents are allowing their children to absorb the ideas, values, and practices of books like Harry Potter and The Egypt Game. We must set a higher standard for our children. If no goal is set, it is sure to be obtained."
3,The Egypt Game,The Egypt Game was a very well written book. The details were amzing- though the storyline was a bit weak. The author obviously put a lot of effort into writing this book. I would definitely reccomend the book because of the creativness and supense of it.
3,highly recommended,I think this is a good book because there is alot of adventure.The book would be diffucult if you are a lower level reader. This book was challenging to me because I don't know much about Egypt yet.It is a good book becuase it makes the kids look like they are going to get in alot of troble but they really dont because the old man is so nice.That is why I recommend The Egypt Game.
2,I did not enjoy this book.,"I did not enjoy this book, but many people disagree with me.I like ""deep"" books, and this was definitely shallow. It isperfect for a shallow read, but I don't like books when youdon't have a special connection with the charecters. It isnot the kind of book that intreges me, but it may integue you.I'd give it a try. Even if you don't like the story, ithas a flavor of Ancient Egypt, which you may find interesting."
5,great book,"This book is terrific. I think that the best books for kids, are the ones that are filled with interesting characters, magic and imaginative play. In this book, six children come together and begin the fascinating game of Egypt, where the ordinary becomes extrordinary, where the kids become high priests and priestesses who guard the secrets of egypt! Interwoven are the kid's individual struggles, and how they overcome them. This book is wonderful because it encourages kids to explore the amazing world of creative play themselves, and also (in opposition to one of the reviews) can enrich a class that is learning about Egypt, because who cares about the facts of Egypt, its all about the magic, which these kids are so fascinated with. A must read for kids and anyone who enjoys great kids literature."
5,Love this stuff!,"I try to take one of these after lunch and after dinner and it has helped me stay awake at work in the afternoons instead of drinking coffee, I feel so much better. I also was having a hard time dropping 5 lbs and this helped me do it!"
3,A flare for murder,"Donkey Punch is a taut little Brit-shocker that succeeds in many aspects, but fails in a couple of important ones. The main problem lies with the characters. The guys are callous and contemptible and the girls more than a little stupid. Although there are signs that the writers realised this, and therefore tried to make a couple of the characters more sympathetic, there's no one here that the viewer can really empathise with and as a result the brutality (and there's plenty of it) is diffused in its effect. And, while the viewer's allegiance is challenged from time to time, its hard to care too much about who survives and who doesn't. It's also a little slow in delivering the mayhem. Once it starts, however, the gears shift and it becomes an efficient, and gory, descent into chaos."
5,Enjoyable book for dad's bedtime story,"My daughter and I found this book to be enjoyable. Not only is it fun to read (and quick) for dads, but a good book for new readers. The stories cover essential topics and how the three friends in the story handle them together. Easy for children to learn from and apply to their situations, such as what those noises in the night really are."
3,50 50 release....,"Overall any release of ANY MST episodes are worth it in my book. But alas this most recent one comes up a bit short....Over all the chuckles and fall out of your seat fun is there. But the inclusion of Hamlet and Overdrawn at the Memory Bank leave this collection a little less than perfect.People have been dissing Girl in the Golden Boots, but hey....this movie brings out a LOT of the older MST fun that I used to enjoy to the extreme! In fact this is a Joel movie if ever I saw one.The best episode, I have to agree is Space Mutiny. Recycled Battlestar Galactica special effects and Baaaaaaaaaaaaaad continunity make this one a keeper. Well worth inclusion in a disc.Rhino if your listening MORE!!!!!! Keep em coming!!!!!!!"
2,MST3000 Vol.4,"I am a huge fan of MST 3000. Yet I am dismayed at how these episodes are pieced together on Volume 4. The commentaries at the beginning of Mike's episodes are really unnecessary. There is only one show featuring Joel which is hilarious. The episodes are so out of sequence going from 1993 to 1999. I wish they would just start from the beginning..... Or, at least even out episodes like Vols. 1 & 2 with Joel and Mike. But I can't slam the shorts. They are the best on Vol. 2 & 3."
4,"Very Good BF2 and Special Forces, But........","For the most part it is a good game, however the expansion packs... Euro forces and Armored fury would not work, EA would not let me register my legal copy, they said that it was not the right code, but I had typed the code in many times and still would not work. But apart from that the game is Very Good. The game play is fairly realistic, the weapons are good and the graphics are pretty good. The multiplayer is about the best part about the game, the single player is not bad though for some strategy and nice explosions. The one thing I am very disappointed with is that EA would sell expansion packs for they're game, but would not always work, I just wish they would have tested it and made sure that is was ready for sales. For an over all rating of just BF2 and SF I would give it a 4 and a half star rating.Hope it Helps."
4,"It's an adapter, not a charger.","Another reviewer complained about it ""not doing anything for you"" - I think they didn't understand what they were buying. It is an AC adapter, not a charger.I need an AC adapter because I plan on using the intervalometer feature to shoot time-lapse photography for up to several months with my PowerShot S1 IS. This will save me possibly hundreds of recharges of batteries and allow me the knowledge that I can let it snap photos for up to 4 days (maximum limit of the camera) without worrying about batteries.I docked it one star because of price. Seems a bit spendy for what you get, but Amazon still had the best price I could find...."
2,Not very good,"Not nearly sufficient for 2011. This is like an arcade game from 1980. Pretty lame. tough to understand the controls, and the graphics are poor."
3,flier,"I need takeoffs & landings, it shuld be easer to fly the aiecraft, reduce the number of controls. I don't fly it much because of all the complications."
3,Gloves are just OK,"The Gloves are very comfortable but they don't last long. The stitching has started to come undone after just a few days of using them. Also I dont think the material on the palm is ""Carbon Fiber"". the palms here the first thing to rip. No were on the tag does carbon fiber show up. It just looks like carbon fiber."
3,A bit of a headache...,"When I got this, it installed with no problems. It didn't work so well with my disk drives, though (one drive didn't work at all, and the other did if I went through ""Audio files"" in the program instead of ""CD Audio""). Some of my CDs were multimedia, so those songs wouldn't even show up. I ripped them with Windows Media Player into WMA, which supposedly work (but didn't). The next day I tried again, but got an error message and had to reinstall the program. Since then, it's worked fine. Also, I downloaded AV MP3 Player to rip songs into MP3's, which have all worked well in converting to ringtones. And a final note, don't expect the ringtones to be CD quality. I did and was very disappointed. With practice, though, I've learned to adjust the volume before creating the ringtone so they at least aren't all staticy when they play on my phone."
1,My Ring Tone Studio,I thought item was difficult to use and it did not work with my nextel phone.....poor item
3,It's OK,I bought this to use with my GN Netcom Profile SureFit Flex Convertible Headset at work. It could be a little longer or the coil give a little more. I can't move very far from the phone.
3,One more criticism,A number of reviewers here have done an excellent job in noting the strengths and weaknesses of the series. The historical inaccuracies and baises are unfortunate and avoidable.One more is just before the attack on Ticonderoga. An English soldier concerned about his fate is reciting the Lords Prayer. He uses the Roman Catholic version at a time when Catholics were not allowed to serve in the army.
3,juvenile,"I wanted to like this program. I have read some serious accounts of the war and this program is really designed for those are completely ignorant of the war. 2 big issues. 1. The 7 Years war in Europe was due to the Prussian desire for Silesia and not caused by some blunder in North America. 2. The politically correct attempt to describe the terror attacks on the settlers as cultural and should be just accepted. This is like saying the Mongol massacres were just cultural. Terror attacks on civilians by any group should be condemned as such. The way the Indians conducted their raids, no matter how ""cultural"" they are explained, could not but bring about the consequences that befell them."
3,TV cart,Product was damaged in shipping and the seller did everything to ensure my satisfaction. Although the TV cart was only middling grade (but very inexpensive - a rating of 3 / 5) the seller gets five out of five for customer service.
3,so particle board is considered wood,"We received it promptly. It took hours to put together something I thought would take 1 hour. I didn't mind that so much, I like puzzles. The biggest disappointment was it is particle board NOT solid wood. Apparently I misread or was mislead. It is however, very very sturdy and easy to roll, so I would rate the construction and appearance 5 stars, but for ease of assembly and materials in which it was made 1 star."
2,Just too dated,I purchased this based on a recommendation but found it to be very difficult to read and somewhat dated. I did not see anything really useful in it and ultimately donated it to the local library.
5,Very handy and easy to use reference.,"This is a great book for getting out of the gates with an LLC. I've been in an LLC for many years now and still was able to learn things from this book. It begins with the basic how-to's such as organizing the company, articles, meetings, minutes etc. Then it delves into different scenarios such as subcontracting, hiring compensation etc. It also gives some ideas on different strategies on loans and also how to handle personal transactions with owner-members. Overall it is well thought out and well laid out. It also contains a CD with many common forms on it as well. I've been able to use the book to familiarize myself with a few ideas and then meet with my CPA to get his thoughts on which direction to go for tax strategies and compensation."
5,Greath 08th Team,"I have seen this on tv when it came out and it was awsome, and when I found this dvd after like 8 years give or take, I wanted to see it again. It's still great and worth the $44, and there was nothing wrong with it and it came with the bonus miller's report. but millers report was mostly clips of the movie with a tiny bit of new stuff but yeah what can you do i say it is worth it but for the people who got miller's report by it self or want to its not worth it at all. But all in all if you're a gundam fan or wanting to know what gundam is I would get this its worth it."
4,The Summer of 1955,"During the summer of 1955 I was staying with my grandparents in Mt Healthy, Ohio, in and around the greater Cincinnati area the locals were seeing UFO's and little green men. That's when they advertised the book They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers and at twelve years old and being freshly introduced to the UFO scare I naturally bought the book. Over the years I misplaced my original book and so with this opportunity to purchase this reprint I now have the opportunity to enjoy it all over once again. The one thing I remember most is that this is the first time the Men in Black are mentioned and since then they have popped up in other writings as well as on screen. I haven't finished re-reading it but so far I have enjoyed it as I did back then in the summer of !955."
2,A fun read but not to be trusted,"I am the author of an article for Skeptical Inquirer about Gray Barker, who was my first publisher. My further research for a new article indicates that Gray didn't even believe much of the story he had related in ""They Knew Too Much ..."" Consequently, read this book with a jaundiced eye!..."
2,Wanted to like it...but...,"Let me start by taking Christ's name is vein. Christ.Now to move on. The main problem with this book is the writing. It's just not very good. The use of language is so distracting infact that it made it impossible to enjoy the story. My main gripe is the fact that the author keeps shifting the focus from the characters to the reader. Rather than show you how the character feels about a situation Mr. Curran tells the reader how the reader would feel in that situation by constantly using ""you"". It's distracting,presumptous and completely pulled me out of the story everytime it happened, which is often.I appreciate the effort that went into the novel and the general ideas were interesting, but if you are a fan of craftsmanship in writing, I can't in good faith suggest you read this book. I also can't help but think a good editor could have solved many of the problems of this book. A shame really."
5,Finaly have a remote again.,The remote arrived before scheduled delivery. I wasn't honestly expecting some of the other pieces that came with the remote. Then I realized I never received those parts when I ordered the actual iRobot. Great service with excellent delivery. If you don't have a remote and you are compatible it is a must.
5,Great choices for Blu-Ray,Love the selections and in this economy did not have the cash for the whole box of looney tunes set to blu-ray. Thanks for thinking about all of us
4,Inexpensive and it talks to you!,"This GPS system is great value for money. Sure the aquisition time could be faster, but it is not too bad, and once the sats are found, tracking is fast. The software is a breeze to use. It even talks to you which is nice when you are paying attention to the road. Just bear in mind that you will want to plug your laptop into your car speakers, as the road noise can easily overwhelm the tiny speakers in a laptop.I really reccomend this GPS system. I am very happy with it."
3,Erratic but mostly functional,"I've just used the LT-20 with Street Atlas 6.0 on a long trip. Most of the time it works well, but there are problems. First, when SA needs to recalculate a route, it does so slowly. Many times it tells you to turn *after* you've passed the intersection! This is still somewhat helpful, but it's a pain. (I am using an IBM laptop; perhaps a faster machine would avoid this problem.) Second, several times SA told us to turn the wrong way. One of those times it lead us into a circle and then directed us into a cul de sac! Sometimes you just need to stare at the maps the old-fashioned way. Third, the interface is clumsy.I haven't used competing software. For $99 you can have a lot of fun with this product, but don't expect it to be polished or super-reliable. And definitely don't rely on the voice directions without a co-pilot."
3,I dont recomend this !,I have been useing this for a year now ! This product has alot of bugs ! It tells you to turn the wrong way alot of times ! It freezes up alot ! Lots of problems I would not buy another product from Delorme ! BEWARE !
1,Don't risk your life with this product !!!,This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this game hoping to use it with friends and have fun...but it is embarrassing, it asks some weird questions, sometimes my friends and I didn't know what they were really asking, and it had no educational value at all. If you really want to have fun, try to find the book, or play Apples to Apples."
2,Not that impressed in baking,"Wish we had not ordered so much, but we were basing on what others said. It is not very sweet at all, disappointed in the baking quality. Also, very clumped and does not blend well AT ALL. However, it is good in coffee."
2,Whole case completely dried out,"I'm used to buying muscavado (like) sugars in europe. This product was dry and almost unusable even with a great deal of effort to reconstitute. I've used this brand before and it was fine, but i believe it comes from the UK and perhaps the transit is just too much or its been sitting in some wherehouse too long. I'd say buyer beware buying this product. Every box in my case was like a hard rock."
4,Great Set of DVDs!,"I have a 10 year old daughter who loves soccer and I spent some time online looking for good lessons for her and I can't say enough about this series of DVDs. They are incredibly well done, very thorough and packed with more stuff than I could have hoped for. All the material is displayed very professionally and easy to find. Simple Soccer is simply awesome. Highly recommended !"
3,Bought this item based on the reviews...,"The description is correct. As it says, it is the TODDLER Dora The Explorer Spoon and Fork. But Amazon incorrectly has the picture showing infant spoons. I bought this item based on the previous reviews as I was in search of the toddler set which shows Dora on the ends of the utensils. My daughter loves this set! Therefore I give it 3 stars as an in between based on the incorrect picture (1 star) and the product I knew I was getting (5 stars) for a great price!"
4,Better than the original,"Mystery wise, it was pretty damn good. I wouldn't have figured out the culprit from clues alone, even if I didn't leave surprised. I enjoyed the multitude of red herrings used to throw me off track, all without any clear motives. The plot 'twist' was a decent one, again not guessed early on by yours truly. The story begins well with Skye encountering yet another difficult set of parents - this is a major theme for the book - and I especially loved the ending wrap-up with her and her mother. Too cute. The middle was fast-paced and attention-grabbing, making the book go fast in a hurry.As before, this ""cozy"" mystery stayed warm and soothing, with violence implied and bloodshed nearly nonexistent. Characters worked well together, mixing up an interesting ensemble that propelled the story forward into a satisfying finale, even if her personal life was left an open book, obviously ""to be continued."""
5,Panasonic DVD-LS90 is a Great Deal,"The reasons I bought this DVD player over the others was for the length of time I could watch movies on a single charge. Most of my trips so far have only been up to 3 hours and it runs the entire time. The display is large enough to watch while on your lap or a couple of feet away and that's all I need. I can plug it into a hotel TV and use the remote conveniently from across the room. It has two headphone jacks for me and my wife to listen at the same time without a splitter. With the headphones I use, the sound is great. The tilting screen makes it very easy to adjust to any cramped condition, such as in the coach section of a plane.The screen is a little grainy, but easy to overlook with the other features.Time passes away so fast with this DVD player while traveling.I usually spend a great deal of time looking at all the features, pros, and cons of electronics; this was no exception. I would buy this again if I had it to do all over."
4,The Sociology of the Woods,"Ferguson sets out on a tour to experience life in some of Americas most significant forests and woods. In each he camps out, hikes, takes notes, but most importantly, interviews people who have lived their entire lifetimes in the wilderness; farmers, sportsmen, forest rangers and moonshiners. from Maine to Appalacia to Minnesota's border lakes and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ferguson is a master storyteller, painting word pictures which allow the reader to ""see"" life in the woods. His writing is crisp and clear and moves at a brisk pace. As I listened to this book I was reminded of Charles Karault's ""On The Road"" series, filled with colorful tales, generous sprinkles of humor and a sense of discovery on each page. If you love the outdoors, you will love this book. If you have never been in the woods, this book will make you wonder why."
4,Very well done; Ferguson opens our eyes,"I didn't think too much of Ferguson's ""Walking Down the Wild,"" partly because I felt like Ferguson was struggling to find something to say about his journey through the Yellowstone wilderness.But here, he has something to say, he says it, and he says it well.Ferguson makes an impassioned argument about the wonder that the American forest can provide; usually, he takes a back seat to others and lets us see the forest through their eyes. Ferguson has chosen his subjects well; simple mountaineers to whom the forest is a way of life, moonshiners, American Indians, and trappers are just some of the people who allow us to see the woods as something more than a pretty view from the car.The writing is strong, and the subject matter is entertaining. You don't have to be a tree hugger to enjoy this book. You just have to be open to developing a respect for the world in which we live."
5,Its not long enough!,"This was not the best rinaldi ive ever read,. but it was one of her best ones to come out in the past few years. I love how rinaldi takes a myth, or mystery, and solves it with a spunky young girl. If you liked this book you will also like.. Mine eyes have seen, by ann rinaldi. i also think you will like 'a ruby in the smoke' and all subsecquent novels by phillip pullman. katherine lasky has some good historical fiction out right now also. whoever you are and what ever your looking for in a book, you will love this book. theres some romance, a lot of controversy, and some downright tough dicitions. i loved this book."
4,"Great pad, but they should've moved Start and Select.","Playstation's Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it, and they usually don't do a very good job. Their d-pads are always too awkward, or their construction is too lightweight. The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last. I'm an emulation gamer, and thanks to the folks at SmartJoy I can use a real PS1/PS2 controller as my PC USB input device.My only gripes with the pad: A) The Start/Select buttons really should've been moved up after the addition of analog sticks. I'm always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select. B) While the d-pad is very sturdy, it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play. Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch-sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows."
1,Looks can be deceiving!,"I ordered the red controller paddle for my little brother for Christmas, because his favorite color is red. But I did not expect to get a Red SuperPad instead. It is not what I ordered, and I am not going to give it to him either. Make sure you read everything before you order something."
1,it doesnt work,when u press the start button...after then when the game is loading ...suddenly after that the games stops to move on...and it keeps on happening again and again everytime i restart my PS2....i m really not happ with that
4,Handbook of international law,"Very informative book. The content is remarkable, and covers emerging areas such as environment law and aviation law.I previously studied international law however this book was very helpful for refreshing my memory on the rudimentary principles, and also giving a broad but comprehensive introduction to the areas that I was less familiar with.It would also be helpful as a guide for persons who have never studied principles of international law.I just wish there was a bit more case law reference."
4,review,"Although the product was not what I was looking for exactly, the service definitely made up the difference. The store offered me a replacement out of their pocket and I thought that was great service. I appreciate there customer service and would recommend anyone to feel safe to order from the seller."
2,Survey Research and the World Wide Web,"This is a disappointing book for a book with a good title. For my interest it was far too basic and provided little new information. It does not provide much that helps evaluate the value of www surveys, does not give any idea of the wide range of types of www surveys and gives no indication of what software and hardware is required. The form of www survey that it describes is the most basic form that really does not extend beyon simple HTML forms and certainly does not represent the potential of these surveys demonstrate the range of things that can be achieved with them. Nor does it provide an adequate account of the dangers of www surveys or solutions to the potential problems The book would be useful to the absolute novice but beyond this it is not very helpful."
5,Smartwool bottom,"I love this product, it works as intended, and is very comfortable. I received this product super fast!!!!! thank you"
2,Not what it used to be,"I bought my first 3M gel-filled wrist rest many years ago and was happy with it. It's really soft and I felt very comfortable with it. So when the time came to buy a new one, I made sure I get another one just like the old one. But after using the new one for 4 months I have to say that I am disappointed. Actually, I bought two. The first one was blue. The color is not practical and it soon started to look dirty. So I bought a black one. But after a short while the gel started to have dents and therefore stopped being comfortable. On top of it, the cover material started to get separated from the base."
4,This does its job,I am happy with my choice for a wrist rest for my keyboard. It stays in place and keeps my wrists level while typing. I am able to do a lot of typing before my wrists need a rest. It is very comfortable. Another great 3M product.
4,The price was right.,"Good price and product was as advertised. Have only taken for about a week, so I am unsure of results."
3,"Roller Coasters, Rides, and Really annoying talking dots","This game is all right, but do not pay 40 dollars for it. I was really disappointed with the look--especially when you're ""riding"" the rides. The game is hard to handle and manuever. But it's a good idea--I like building my own roller coasters. I just wish I could make them go upside down (unless that's a feature I haven't found yet). It was okay, but I don't really think it's worth a lot. If you can rent it, that would be a good way to go. The worst part is the annoying guy who talks to you, telling you that your drinks are good, then telling you that people aren't satisfied with your drinks. It's annoying. But the game was okay aside from that."
4,Lives on the Boundary,"Lives on the Boundary: A Moving Account of the Struggles and Achievements of America's Educationally UnderpreparedYears ago when I first read this story, I liked the story. I didn't like Mike Rose or his politics. Working in the system, as they say, has softened me to him or rather what he said. Being bi-lingual is important, but to make it in the system and up the ladder, you have to know English here. It has to be clear and correct at the door. I did not agree with that a decade ago. I see his point now, thanks to some wonderful young men taught me real potential is and a real door is."
2,Don't last,I bought 2 of these batteries as back ups and they lasted for a couple of years but then started not holding a charge. Now they are to the point that you can't even use them for more than 10 pictures before the camera shuts off. The oem battery is definitely the way to go. It has lasted like a champ. It still takes just as many pictures before running out of juice from when I first bought it. My suggestion is to not buy the product and go with the oem or name brand product.
2,"Great value, ok battery","I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could! For me, 2 1/2 stars means ok.I bought this battery about a year ago. I never scientifically tested it, but it lasted as long as my canon battery at first.I've noticed recently that it hardly holds a charge now.I do use my camera a lot (Our fist baby was born about a year ago too!), but the official cannon battery has lasted just fine. I leave one battery in the charger and trade them when one goes dead, so I use them equally.Now I'm not saying this is a horrible battery, and I still think it's worth it. I'm actually buying another one! Considering the fact that the official canon battery is 4 times the price, I still think it's a good value. I could be wrong, but I don't see how the cannon battery will end up lasting 4 years!If you can deal with buying a new battery every year, this seems like a good deal for a secondary battery."
4,Very affordable!,"The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is because I haen't had it long enough to determine if it will last a long time. So far it works fine, just like the original cannon battery. It charges good, I didn't time it to see how long but plugged it in, and let it run its course. I bought another kind of replacement as well and cannot tell the difference between it, this one, and the original. So it gets two thumbs up! There are some other batteries on Amazon for way cheaper, like less than 2 bucks, but the shipping on those is way more expensive than this one, and they all work the same to me. Love this little guy! (I actually bought two so now I have three batteries and almost never seems like I am charging anything! Great for traveling when charging is not convenient!)"
2,Died when I needed it,"I would estimate that I gave this battery maybe 20 charges.It seemed to work fine, then last week when I needed it, it died and will no longer take a charge.Might want to consider original equipment replacement battery if reliability is critical for you."
4,Good generic make,"Got this one for my new SD750. It takes more pictures than the original battary in full charge. Because this one is 900mah. Price is very good. The price you paid for the original, you can have 3 of this. The reason I gave a 4 stars it is because it doesn't come with the cover to protect the circuit matal area."
3,battery,"I would have wanted to know that the battery was not pre-wrapped/ shrink wrapped, so it did not look new. Quick response from company that it was new."
3,Filter : Title of DVD - Atrocious Audio,"The content of the feature is pretty good, if you are a Filter fan, its very enjoyable. The audio on the other hand is awful....it is scratchy metallic...like something is wrong with your speakers...only its the DVD. When I received my first copy, I called back and had a 2nd one shipped, thinking I had a bad DVD. I encountered the same problems. Unless you are a DIEHARD fan, who simply must know more about Filter...save your money...because it is a drag to listen to, which is why we all like Filter in the first place...we like to listen to them. Its too bad either Filter or the record label didn't bother testing this out before they shipped them all."
5,Excellent NYC Show!,"The first thing about this show - which HBO has done before really well - is showcase the electricity of New York City. It is a fun show in which you can vicariously experience the rush of trying to make it in the big NYC. The acting is on point, the story is engaging and you also are able to enjoy Kid Cudi on HBO. I truly hope for more of this show in the future as there truly is nothing else like it on TV."
2,mitsubishu 65inch tv,"I bought this tv 3 years ago and replacing the bulb now for the third time at $100 EACH. I was told I was lucky by Mitsubishi that if I get a year out of a bulb, that is good. Some places charge up to $200 a bulb. I just wasn't expecting to have to put this kind of money into a tv yearly. Well the last bulb only lasted 9 months. I would not recommend this tv for this reason. It is nice was it works, but unfortunately it is costly every year."
2,Poorly executed,"This was one of 3 books by Lydia Adamson I have read. This is one from the ""vet"" mystery series. The other 2 were from a ""birdwatcher"" mystery series and a ""out of work actress/catsitter"" mystery series I did not find any reason to recommend any of them.The plots are haphazardly constructed. Many of the situations are tortuously contrived. Characters are 2-dimensional and banal. The writing itself is clumsy. The vocabulary and structure seem to be ""dumbed down"". Perhaps these books are intended for younger readers?The reason I award 2 stars rather than 1 is that there is nothing truly offensive here. It is a predictable ""spunky female protagonist solves mystery that baffles bumbling males"" kind of story. It is simply more sloppily executed than most.If you enjoy trying to ""figure out whodunnit"" as you read, these books will disappoint. Most of the pertinent information is only revealed in the last few pages - in a kind of rush to tidy up the loose ends."
1,Doesn't work with Mac,"Contrary to the advertised capability, this didn't work with my MacBook Air. I had to return it. I liked the size and simplicity of design, but was disappointed that it didn't work for m."
2,inadequate,"Ironically, do not purchase this book if you are seeking in-depth information on your specific MBTI type. I purchased this book after taking the official Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which recommended the book ""for a complete discussion of the sixteen types."" Even though this book is 228 pages long, it only devotes approximately three paragraphs to each of the 16 types! One type is specifically discussed for merely there sentences! That is unacceptable. If you want to know more about your specific type, I recommend that you google it; there are many webpages devoted to thoroughly discussing each type."
3,Not Good,"Review by Chris Conlan:It seems like concept albums are the hottest thing since ""enter cool thing here"". Boys Night Out takes a chance with the concept theme with their latest release Trainwreck. To let everyone know what the album is about, here is the short rundown: there is a patient, a doctor, and a dead girlfriend. That pretty much sums it up.The music on Trainwreck really isn't that interesting. Halfway through the album, you'll forget about the story and the music, and just hope that the next song will redeem itself.. Well, it doesn't. The beginning half of the album is the best part. ""Medicating"" is probably one of their best songs to date. Great melody and well sung vocals, you also get some good ol' hand clapping at the end of the song.This album just falls short. It's not the story that lacks, it's the music. Not what the doctor ordered."
2,What happened?,"What happened? I guess this proves you cant assign one particular genre to every band, and this female voice is becoming a cliche; not that there is anything wrong with that. If you are a fan of Boys Night Out you should probably listen to samples of the CD before you buy it."
1,Big Al is Just Too Big and Amazing,"I was so excited when I heard about this 'sequel' that I ordered Big Al and Shrimpy immediately. I am a huge Big Al fan and perhaps my expectations were too high. I was very, very disappointed. The story was stilted and you do not have an opportunity to 'fall in love' with Shrimpy, so the story was flat and evoked little sympathy and emotion. I am teacher for students that are also Big Al fanatics and I didn't even read it to them. Some originals are just too good to follow."
4,ONE FOR CONSPIRACY BUFFS,"I stumbled across this book in an Afro-American bookstore. A customer who had just heard a review of this book on the radio pointed it out to me. I snatched the book up because (in my experience) books like this disappear from distribution shortly after being published.I'm one of those who believe in ""alternative"" politics and history. If you are a conspiracy buff, you should add this one to your collection. You may have questions about was the authors' theory, but this book still raises disturbing questions and possibilities."
1,B&W Swimsuit Photography...Really!,"The images in this book are B&W, no color, Models, bathing suits, palm trees and beautiful beaches...all in B&W, you have got to be kidding. A big waste of time and money!"
4,Nice Scope,"I am pleased with this scope, but must add that it's January in Wisconsin and I haven't had a chance to do much with it yet."
5,bound to be a success,"first off, i dont have this game yet, but from what i heard from all the people who had played it, it's bound to be great. More challaging puzzles, and supposedly it is the scariest Nancy Drew game yet. I say 'supposedly' because since i havent played it yet, i'm not sure, but i know that it'll be a thriller. And according to the screen shots on herinteractive.com, the rooms and everything look so interesting. it's beautiful looking really. here, check it out. http://www.herinteractive.com/prod/cur/index.shtmlover all, i think this game is going to be GREAT."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have never played a game like this before so I'm not sure how it would rate compared to other such games, hence the 4 stars. However, I've really enjoyed playing it and would buy more in this series."
2,boring-not spooky- blackmoor manor,"i have played all of the nancy drew games before and was really looking foward to this one. but it turned out to be a big disapointment. it is NOT that scary, and it leaves too many unanswered questions after you solve the mystery. there is so many puzzles that you have to figure out that after awhile you forget what the purpose of the puzzle was. the manor could have had alot more rooms to explore, and you only got to talk to some of the characters a few times. hopefully the next game, the secret of the old clock, will be much better!"
3,Too difficult for most 10-year-0lds,This game is much too difficult for most children...my 28 year-ol computer savvy daughter had difficulty with it. The chat-room at nancydrewgames.com is virtually useless...it is as if they want you to buy the guide book. I will never buy another game from this company.
2,Don't let the title fool you!,"In my ""humble"" opinion, the characters were one dimensional, not very likeable, and quite comical.The product name dropping was annoying. I expected more from Ms. Nelson since her non-fiction works are very good. This book, however, was, simply put, ""Silly!"" It was as though payment would be received by the word and there were many unnecessary words to describe simple things. After several attempts, I had to chock it up as a lost. Definitely borrow this book from a friend, enemy or the library."
4,oooooooh......Take me there!,"I thought the book was really good and it gave my imagination a chance to run wild. I thought the story line was well written. Although, I thought Lorenzo showing up at the spa as a women was far fetched. I also thought Lydia's mother would have had a role at the spa. I would have been great if the women who attended the spa could send their husbands to the training course. (smile)"
2,Sexual Blah...,"This book was really disappointing, especially since I'd read a lot of raving reviews online. It was often dull and tedious to get through, with lots of lengthy unnecessary designer product descriptions. The dialogue seemed odd and unrealistic to me, but maybe that's because I'm only 28 and the characters are in their 40s. Anyway, while the concept was cool (a discrete and tasteful full-service spa and brothel for black women) the execution fell flat. And for all the book's promise of this revolutionary, liberating approach to black women's sexuality, it turned out to be nothing more than a standard-issue supermarket romance novel, minus the romance. If you want to read about men ""eatin' that pie"" and ""finding your love nugget"" by all means, pick this book up. Otherwise, I'd advise you to skip it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money!!!,I checked this book out of the library (thank goodness I didn't spend money on it) two weeks ago and it's time for me to return it. I am on page 137 and there are 318 pages in this book. Needless to say I will not finish it. Why? Because every time I attempt to read this book I fall asleep. Actually I skipped over about half of the book. Several posters said the book it too wordy. That is an understatement!!! What really irritated me most is the constant reference to designers. Who cares? Anyway I can't finish this book because it is not worthy of the time it's going to take me to finish it. Right now you can get this book on Amazon for one penny. THIS IS NOT A BARGAIN!!!! YOUR TIME IS WAY MORE VALUABLE THAN THAT.
2,Mistakes,"Giovanni di Francesco de CREVELLERIA was an architect of the Seventeenth Century. He erected Galileo's tomb in Santa Croce.Lippi's assistant was not this Crevelleria but Giovanni di Francesco da ROVEZZANO ( J. Ruda) [1439 -1459]. A predella hangs in the Louvre, beside Lippi's Madonna . Da Rovezzano's masterpiece can be admired in the Casa Buonarroti, Firenze.The Carmelite Saints in the cathedral of Santo Stefano, in Prato, were painted by Fra Diamante, not by Lippi (see Mannini: The Restoration of Lippi's Nativita, 1998).Like Vasari, Milanesi's editions have been accepted as the norm for several decades (Vasari's for several centuries)."
1,Not recognized by printer and leaves you a hand full of ink!,"First...the shipment was delayed and the company has to send an apology letter for the error in shipment. I was excited when it came. Then I tried to take the chip from the old ink cartridge and paste it in the new one (pain in the ....). then when I inserted in in my canon PIXMA iP6600D, the cartridge cannot be recognized. I took it off and repositioned the chip and thas when i noticed that my hands are now full of ink oozing from the cartridge.I try to save some money in buying this ink but turned out to be a mistake. I learned my lesson, but what I cannot comprehend is how Amazon can tolerate this ""junks"".So folks.....avoid...avoid...avoid!"
1,leave me screaming,"All I can say is SUCKED, The Mex Chick is Hott (the one w/Blond Hair), not the movie, Buyer Beware"
3,DVI Splitter,"If you are looking for a splitter to use two monitors on your computer through a dvi connection this is the one to buy.One warning though, when you buy the DVI cables insure they have the correct pin layout, I made the mistake of getting a cable that had four pins around the blades and would not work."
1,CABLE splitter,THIS product barely worksthe Cable bow does not have enough juice to push thru and provide a clear signalthe DVD and Sony PS3 work v good!I say do not buy as there are other ways to split the signal -- You can have mine just send me the postage money!
4,Good product but it was torn when it arrived.,"About the first 18"" was torn where it was taped in several places but after cutting that part off it was fine."
2,Poor,"When I receive it, I notice the backdrop was bent in half. I don't know if it was do to the shipment or the seller. Now every time, I would have to go into Photoshop to remove that bent. It's really time consuming and should be the least of my worries. I bought many backdrops before and this had never happened. If it was do to poor shipment, you would think the seller would know to put ""fragile"" on it. Considering the backdrop is very long, one would think that made since. You pay good money for it, you should get good quality. It's just my 2 cents."
3,So far ... it's lacking something,"I bought the first season because I was/am a great fan of Stargate SG1. I have viewed about five episodes and while the premise is interesting, the plots and writing are bland.The characters are not strong enough. They each need their own eccentricities to be more interesting.Amanda Tapping's British accent seems to come and go.Finally, conflicts get resolved too easily. The writers need to make things much harder on the characters. The bad guys need to be more of a challenge.I will finish the season, but if it doesn't improve, will not buy the second season."
2,"Bad FX, Bad story, annoying accent","Found nothing worthwhile in this show, except possibly the premise.Poor execution mars this badly-cheesy FX, Amanda Tappings annoying accent and uninteresting characters."
2,It's like Fringe,"If Fringe was completely formulaic and kind of sucked and was soulless, this would be Fringe if it met all those criteria and some other levels of suckitude."
3,it was a gift,i have no idea of how to rate this..it was not for me.This is not my kind of a show but i guess the recipiant loike it.
1,Can't eliminate subtitles,"Try as one might, the subtitles take up about 1/3 of the screen and it is impossible to turn off the subtitles.Other than that, the program takes on the appearance of a budget production."
4,Print review,The print I purchased arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I was very happy with the entire purchase experience. The picture is beautiful and the person who received it was quite taken with it.
5,THIS IS AWSOME!!!,"This is awsome! It includeds the pad and stand! I was a little dissapointed to see that it didn't come with sticks, though. It IS loud, as the other people said, but it's pretty good. The stand fits the pad perfectly, and it can control weather you want to play it sitting or playing it standing. As I said, It's really good. I hope that it's good for my drum lessons. I hope you buy this one, because I liked it and probably you will, too. :)"
5,Very fast and in great condition,thank you for the speedy deliver. I look forward to doing business with you again. thanks again.
2,You don't have to be a psychic,"I started watching this show when it first came on, and like many of the other reviewers, I was immediately delighted with Hugh Laurie's witt and sarcasm. However, as I continued to watch each week, it occured to me that every single episode of this show is virtually identical: A patient comes in who House immediately diagnoses with a common illness. But guess what? It isn't a common illness! It is in fact the most obscure and farfetched explanation possible, and in the process of finding this out, House will break protocol, alienate his superiors, and almost lose his job, all for the sake of saving the patient. End. While this isn't necessairly a bad plot, seeing it over and over and over is rather formulaic and it is easy for your attention to wane. The only real reason to watch this show is for Laurie's sarcasm, but I get enough of that from my kids already."
3,Excelente serie... lástima que no sea anamórfica,"HOUSE M.D. es de lo mejor que se está haciendo en la TV norteamericana.... todo un personaje este tipo....Una primera temporada muy bien escrita, muy bien actuada y excelentemente dirigida...SI O SÍ en su colección...."
4,Great DVD!,"This was a gift for my father for christmas ... it's a great show, and Hugh Laurie is a great actor! (He has made quite the transition from his earlier british comedy origins!)"
5,Fantastic Season One of House,"I bought this Season One set of DVDs of House for a friend, but never having watched an entire episode, I thought I'd watch some of the episodes to see what the attraction was. I'm hooked! I know this will be a great gift (if I end up giving it)! There is one scratch on disk 1 which makes the player delay for a few seconds, but it's not bad. I recommend the purchase of Season One of House and the person who sent it is reputable to send it promptly and the product is as described."
4,"Great show, but a problem.","I ordered House (Season One) and enjoyed it. It's one of the best shows out there. The extras are great, too. When I got to the last two episodes (which are on the bottom of the third disk) it skipped. Instead of playing Three Stories, it skipped to the middle of Honeymoon. I wasn't too upset and just decided to trade it in, but the second one I got did the same thing.Other than that, great buy, great show."
5,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"It will completely take up your life until its finished and its got 20 odd of them on it! I live in the UK and the series over here started at the start of series 2 so i had to get my hands on the first one. Not being available in the Uk till later in the year and at 50% more price than the USA i turned to international amazon, im pleased i did. The Dvd is excellent, the programme is fantastic and is as good if not better than the 2nd series. We have lost a comic god over here in the UK - (you lot over the pond probably dont even realise that hugh laurie is a seriosly funny man - buy some fry and laurie from the UK!) but what we have lost as a comic god we have gained in a brilliant addictive US series, which rarely for the USA is not all 'cute' or 'out there'"
5,Very well written and entertaining!,"I can't get enough of House, a CSI type medical drama. It's great to watch on the DVD's without the commercial interruptions. I finally got through season one and working on season two. This show is very well written, very entertaining, never boring, witty etc. I hope there will be many more seasons of House. The casting is incredible. At this point I can't say enough good things about it."
5,One of the Best Shows on tv,I was new to House when I bought seasons 1 and 2 on DVD. I watched them all in the span of a weekend when i first bought them and I still watch them religiously all the time. My only complaint is season 1 is boxed with 3 double sided dvds which i don't really care for (they can get scratched up very easily) and that sometimes when i try to play them on my computer they will skip around (but not on a regular dvd player...hmmm)Other then those minor flaws I am absolutely in love with these dvds. Props to Hugh Laurie and the rest of the cast for their absolute talent.
1,Horrible bootleg copy,"I was excited to recieve my copy of House Season one, until i opened the packaging... This is not an orignial from Universal, but a fake. I have contacted Universal inregards to it. And Amazon has credited me for this purchase... Buyer Beware!"
5,House Review,The set was very entertaining. The enjoyment factor per dollar was great. I am thinking that this is the way to watch programs in the future.
5,House is fun to watch on DVD,House is a great show and watching it on DVD is even better. As I watch the second season I think the first season might have been better.
4,Worked,"We bought aa set of track lights at a close out sale. The vendor told us we needed a floating canopy and that they could order one, but it would take a week. I just typed the brand and model into Google and it came up with availability at Amazon (where I should have gone first). Less cost and quicker delivery than the local vendor."
1,totally worthless,These won't hold anything. A plastic tarp just slips through the jaws. Check out the EZ Grabbit tarp holders (also sold by Amazon). I've gone 70 mph on the highway with them on a tarp and they held 100%. They're well worth the extra money.
3,Practical,"This is more of a practical manual on how to get some change done than a page turner meant for entertainment. I laud the authors for this, but for those of us who don't have time to get out and become community organizers, I think other books offer the same expose."
4,desk lamp,"The two light settings are both excellent -- the hi setting is extremely bright. The magnifying glass is perfect. The balance is good, tho the base is a bit bulky in order to support the weight."
2,Be Cautious !!!!,"Be careful if deciding to buy this item. I purchased this perticuliar item, and received the $5.95 version. Now I have to deal with the time consuming hassel of returning it. Better to spend the few extra dollars and go to your local service provider store and buy the version sold by them."
1,Item description and contents do no match product received,"I ordered this product and what I received did not match the item ""product Features"" list:Pre-measured natural henna powderPre-measured mixing solutionEucalyptus oilApplicator with fine tipReusable stencil transfersThe only thing that came with it was henna powder and mixing solution. While I know it said ""refill"" it also listed it came with the other items, which it does not. Buyer beware. Seller needs to fix their item description and not mislead the customers."
5,love obsessed with these,love obsessed with these i am officially addicted to collecting these and this perticular bear was ver new looking and one of the cutest well made ones i have
4,Tank Sprayer,Pretty much as advertised. Easy to assemble. The box it came in ws flismy and was damaded although the product was not. Ha to tighten mot os the connections as they leaked. Other that that it works fine.
5,An incredible book!,"This amazing book is a MUST for anyone who is traveling to Venice. The author does more to give you a sense of who the Venitians are, and why the are the way they are, than you could ever get anywhere else, even if you lived there. Norwich does a masterful job of placing Venice's history in the context of all of Europe and the Middle East surrounding it. American will find the decidely British form of writing a bit much at first. But once you've gotten into the swing of it, you'll be swept up in the mastery of the story-telling and the majesty of Venice."
2,This would be great.. except,"I would have given this five stars, except, like all the other Pratchett movies apparently, there are NO CLOSED CAPTIONS. If you're deaf, you're out of luck. Unacceptable."
3,Animated Terry Pratchett,"Kept to the storyline, but could have done with a defter hand in the editing. Seemed to take forever to tell the story."
5,Michael Parkes is amazing!,"What can I say? I don't know how to best describe Michael Parkes artwork. Beautiful, imaginative, surreal? Michael Parkes has a lot of influence from master artists such as Klimt, but has created a world which is uniquely his own. Lovely winged maidens (often with mechanical wings) pose with elegant grace along with animals and mythological creatures. Men wear elegant masks, looking like sensual harlequins. What makes Parkes so fascinating is his ability to draw off many sources of classical myth and complie them into one image, it is not unusual in his world to see a Grecian style angel being visited by an egypian style feline, and yet it all works very harmoniously together. This book is wonderful eyecandy for all those drawn to imaginative, sensual mythology. I keep it for inspiration."
3,Dye,"Although this did work, it was not as intense as i was expecting. It was not too bad, could be more red."
3,Flawed design,"This infuser is better than many but falls short of its promise. It's deep depth means it can be used in almost any sized cup or teapot. Many shallow infusers barely reach the surface of the water and so are unsuitable for long brewing. Its mesh is also finer preventing the tea leaves from escaping into the cup. It's diameter is also wider permitting use with wider openings although an even wider lip would be preferable.However, this infuser has one major problem: the mesh is folded to form the infuser's cylinder shape. This allows tea leaves to get caught inside the folds of the mesh. They are then impossible to remove."
2,overpriced,"No problems with shipping at all it even arrived early. But the cord broke within a week. One of the retaining clips cracked and i didn't realize it until it didn't want to release from my t226 and I had to break it further to remove it. I also couldn't be around a computer, satellite dish, or microwave or the cord would pick up static for the other person on the line. I'm getting a new phone with blue tooth but this could have been avoided with a little more insulation for the device."
1,Misleading info & totally worthless for what I wanted.,"I was looking for a french-english translation of the Trojans, because the turkeys at Philips didn't put translations in the box-set of Berlioz works I got earlier (don't worry, I gave them a shafting in the relevant review)This copy, printed in the late sixties, only had the english. Also contains only the first three acts, after they had avertised it as 'Opera in Five Acts'.Plus, for a very thin book, they charged me more than $10 postage (the double-volume biography I got of Berlioz, weighing a ton, they only charged me $16)A bunch of con-artists."
1,not worth this price,As good as this movie is. lets face it its a classic. But having said that a crime to contemplate paying more then 40 Dollars tops on this movie. Do yourself a favor and check it out in pieces on you tube. at least give me a dvd copy for this eye popping price
3,Not Great But Not Bad,"This wargame recreates the famous American Civil War Battle of Gettysburg. It's not an realtime strategy clickfest. You give orders to your units, press the end button and watch your units and those of the enemy carry out their orders simultaneously. It's not as complex as some wargames but it does require knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the various units and careful planning. The unit graphics are okay, but the animations look choppier the closer you get to the action. The map is nicely rendered. This isn't a game I'd play for hours on end, but for a quick wargame experience, it's not bad."
4,Pretty Fun!,"This game has pretty good graphics and sound, I love the gameplay, I saw the movie Gettysburg, and I played all the battles I saw in the movie,It can get boring after a while but you can play little round top, or even Pikkets charge, you command artillirey infantry calvary and even generals. I bet there are better games of civil war but this is a good one! I am a civil war buff and reenactor so I suggest you could buy it, its worth it!"
5,Out of the blue,"This CD surprised the hell out of me. It's ""Disraeli Gears"" for the new millenium. I can't stop listening to it. Hits me where I live."
1,I am SO disappointed!!!,"I bought this book without reading any reviews and found it to be a complete waste of time. Mr. Hicks recommends borrowing money ""to the hilt"" in order to finance real-estate purchases. To me, this seems like a surefire way for most people to get into a heap of debt. What's worse is that there aren't any good resources available in the book, only references to other books and newsletters (which aren't even free). I wish I had waited and read some reviews first! I am truly disappointed."
2,Not a beginner DVD,"I purchased this DVD because I practiced yoga over 5 years ago and wanted to start doing it again. I don't feel that this DVD is for beginners. It is way too advanced and she does not go into any detail to explain the poses, plus her voice is taped over the segments.I like exercise DVD's where the instructors' voice is talking throughout the DVD like you are in a yoga class in your own living room, she does not do this.Actually the thing I find the most distracting and unprofessional is her choice of clothing for the sun portion of the DVD. .... Desiree is a beautiful, very well endowed woman and her yoga top is cut just way too low. Others may not have a problem with it, but I certainly don't think it honors her as a yoga instructor. Maybe it was done to increase sales? Fortunately the second half of the DVD she has on a different top, so no problem there."
1,Aussies Beware!,"This is one of those occasions where the U.S. ""sense of humour"" just doesn't translate. This movie, even with the Film Crew audio track, just sucks - plain and simple. It's dreadful!Run away! Run away!"
4,Great Locale,"I was initially drawn to this novel because it was based in the US Virgin Islands, where I'm originally from. This is one of the most realistic relationships I've read. I like that the couple argued. Liked that they didn't just fall into bed. They got to know each other. The characters were three dimensional.I have only two faults with this novel: the first is that it bothered me that the author had Eva call Adam by Maxwell at times and then Adam other times and then Max a few times. The novel is titled ""Adam and Eva"" so I think Adam should have been used throughout.The second thing that bothered me was that Eva had unprotected sex with Adam more than once knowing that he had been in a sexual relationship with Lavona. Since she hadn't been with anyone since her husband, I doubt she was on the pill. That bit of irresponsibility could have been corrected by the author.Great story! I would definitely read again."
2,Not Impressed,Bought this scanner as an upgrade. The NOAA weather channel bleeds thru most of the public service channels making listening very annoying. I wish I had my old scanner back!
2,Disapointing product,My 25yr old Radio Shack scanner receives all the local police channels. This scanner is not only confusing but also fails to receive all but two police channels.
2,no codes,"After checking all the specs for this scanner I bought it for my sons birthday. He could not get the police calls in our area with out ""trunk tracker"" After checking it himself he realized he would need a more expensive scanner (not a big problem) but would also then have to paid more money to get the codes. He suggested I buy a puppy for myself and forget the scanner. Very disappointed, thought this would be a great present!"
1,dissatified,I ordered this Uniden 300 channel scanner..suppose to be christmas gift for my husband. For some reason..without my knowledge...they cancelled my order!!!! I have purchased other items from Amazon with great results but can say the seller of this product has left a very bad taste in my mouth and can honestly say they do NOT fulfill their customers requests.
2,Disappointing Product,"Problems with this scanner include a squelch that affects the AM band, an alarm display that cannot be viewed while lying in bed, and an instruction manual that has ommissions,is confusing and very frustrating to use. With the display softkeys being redefined constantly one loses track of modes and band limits, etc., and with a manual written so poorly, it makes the whole operating experience a total disaster. On the plus side the receiver is quite sensitive. The unit has a good appearance and feel of the controls is good. It would also be nice if the AC supply was contained within the unit. I expected more from a top of the line product and a manufacturer with a reasonably good reputation."
4,Well it works,"It is not bad, but there must be a bit better. My biggest gripe is you can not see the display unless you are right on top of the unit. There was no trouble setting it up. I actually get very good reception.There is only one alarm so be forewarned that this may not replace your clock radio. Still I like it."
4,Bearcat clock radio scanner,The unit works well. The clock synchronized up with NIST time signal with no problem. I love that the alarm time can be set with a keypad. The scanner works well but directions are complicated and documentation is somewhat lacking.
4,tells you mote than the typical data books,lots of insight into different campuses - a good supplement to the big data books on the bookshelf
5,AMAZING RIDE!,"fascinating film of cross country bike ride to promote Amazing Race and raise money for MS, incredible filmwork, especially capturing the treacherous highway challenges, beautiful America, tough weather, hills, and joy rides downhill... the friends made along the way, the bonding of long term friends and family is very touching and have a new found appreciation for this man, what an athlete!!! Thanks for this wondrous trip."
3,It's a bicycle tour. Can we not slow down a bit?,"First of all, as an avid cyclist any bicycle related content is of at least some interest to me. This video was no exception. However, I have watched many similar titles such as Ride the Divide, that seem to possess a certain spirituality.For whatever reason this film didn't. It seemed like the whole movie was in a rush. Rush to get from here, rush to get to there. Rush to get the film made. And what it forgot is that while the destination is important we would much rather experience the journey.This film would fit the legal definition of a documentary because it carefully documents a much hurried ride across America, but what it doesn't do, is move the audience. It races from day to day and leaves behind what were likely many interesting untold stories."
1,Very Poor,I find that Phil wanted to be a comedian more than focus on MS. Very stupid jokes and it was all about him not MS. I believe he did it mainly to promote himself rather MS awareness.
5,exactly what I wanted,Thank you so much! I had to buy this specific book to replace a library book and was thrilled that it was in perfect condition. I was much cheaper than the price the library wanted and was shipped quickly.
3,Hello hot sexy Milanne siegel [played as susan],I think that Milanne siegel [played as susan] is sooooo very hot. sure would like to talk to you babe....mikey :}
5,Best jazz performances on dvd,"this guy has the great talent, the discipline, the musical friends, the dignity, the beauty and grace. nothing not to like"
3,Great...BUT NOT IN HI-DEF!!!,"Agree with all the ""Great"" reviews...but if you NOTICE people...when theconcert starts, switch to 480p!!!Greetings from Mex."
1,Visual disappointment,"Having read raving review at Hi Def Digest that calls this a reference quality disc, I bought it. I will be more cautious next time in following their advices: this looks worse than an upscaled DVD. Music and performances are top notch, but we buy Blu-ray discs for picture too, and here, the picture quality is awfull. Sharpnes vibrates all the time, edge enhancement is unbearale sometimes, colors are all over the place... Very disappointing..."
4,Pleasing,"Chris is certainly not in awe of himself, at all......that's nice, hope he stays that way. This is a very nice concert by Chris and his guests.....he's right about his band - they're great, too.Would like to see him and a small group do a bit as if in a small night club....late at night, just before closing.......soft 'n......GH"
3,Good for history class but no actual chapters,"Information is somewhat random and doesnt always pertain to the topic in the book. This was used for College taking a pacific northwest history class. Good for that, nothing else really"
4,Nice watch at a good price,"I bought this watch from Amazon for $214 after tax. The watch said ""Swiss part, China movement"". I later on found it was on sale at the Bay department store for $86 CAD (before tax). It is ""Swiss movement"""
1,??????????????????????????????,Can ANYONE EXPLAIN to me WHY this book would COST $239?????Is this a missprint???? WHY is this book so expensive? NO book is worth this much.
1,"No page numbers, no ""locations"", junk","I just bought this and it's junk. You can't return to a location if you shut off, because there aren't any, so you have to start from the beginning and fish your way through to find where you left off. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
3,A Few Drawbacks to the Kindle Edition,"As others have said, The Atlantic is an excellent publication, but the Kindle version falls short on two fronts. First, there are no illustrations. Thankfully, the Atlantic's articles can stand up on their own, but it would be nice to have some of the charts and graphs that make it to the print edition. Second, the price was recently raised from $1.25 to $1.99, which wouldn't be a big deal except that the print version is only 46 cents more now. When the Kindle edition was half the price of the print edition, I didn't mind the missing graphics, but now I'm seriously considering switching back to the print format."
3,Missing issues? Undelivered issues expire and cannot be downloaded,"Discovered today that undelivered issues of the magazine, other than the most current issue, cannot be delivered to my Kindle. This is a problem I encountered with both The Atlantic and The New Yorker. Kindle support will issue a credit for undelivered, undeliverable issues. (You can choose a promotional credit or a refund to your credit card.) Hated to cancel my Kindle subscription and return to paper, but inconsistent delivery is not acceptable. I want every issue of the magazine downloaded once to my Kindle, or what's the point of an electronic subscription? Who knew there was an expiration date on downloads? Hope this helps."
3,Excellent Dentist Office Addition,"I like the Atlantic, but I confess I do not like it enough so that I will continue to subscribe. I read it while awaiting treatment at my dentist's office, while on the train or at a coffee shop. In 45 minutes, I have had my fill. It is otherwise not compelling in its originality or capacity.The articles are better than most popular magazines. I enjoy Mark Steyn and Mark Bowden, but get tired of Christopher Hitchens' proselytory writing tone.Occasional issues have been dumbed down, are feel as if they are being geared for the Entertainment Tonight crowd.The Atlantic is a good read in short spurts, but inconsistent over the entire issue, I now only buy a couple issues a year, at most.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"
2,The Atlantic,"The January issue might be the best yet, but Amazon have forgotten to send it to me so I cannot review it."
5,Haven't Seen The Movie,"Even through i haven't seen the movie i did buy the soundtrack of the movie, i did enjoy the soundtrack my favorite song on the soundtrack is Friends For Live by Rhett Akinks & Mark Wills and Light At The End Of The Tunnel by Lee Ann Womack & Rhett Akins. I have always love Tom Sawyer and since it's in cartoon mode i know it will be good to watch.Rondall"
2,I didn't notice a difference,"um...It smells nice...not sure what else to say about this. I will not purchase again, particularly at this high of a price. Maybe it worked at the microscopic level and I'm just not aware of its value - I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but I expected my face to feel slightly softer or smoother or show some small difference that at the the very least validated buying it. I couldn't tell any difference, except that I am now out a few dollars"
4,"Puts the ""pow"" in powder!","You will feel a definite buzz from this powder. Much like drinking 8 cups of coffee. Why ""8""? I have no idea."
3,Where are the updates and revisions?,This is the same 1996 edition in a new cover. A big clue was the list of suburban Chicago libraries still with the 708 area code. Most of them changed to 847 in 1996.I don't see any mention of the Internet either. There is a lot of info online for Chicago/Cook County research.The basic information is very informative and I have helped several people by using this book.I am awaiting the revised edition.
1,Stay away from this product!,IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IP6600D. AMAZON HOW COULD YOU LET THIS PRODUCT RUIN YOUR REPUTATION AS A RELIABLE ONLINE STORE!Cheap prices doesn't always results in savings...Just get an original canon ink.
5,good buy,"Lots of good information for the money.The book needs more pictures - too much dry text, but you can't get a better book on the market.Also, the author clearly states where he inserted his own thoughts and ideas, and what information comes from scientific research. A big plus not found in other sources where they simply tell you ""weightlifters shouldn't bench press"" without any proof (Mr. Drechsler honestly says ""in my opinion, ..."" or ""from my personal experience, ..."")"
5,These were the guys!,"Intelligent , warm and fun.And exciting because it's a LIVE album, they were sort of the roof-topBeatles of Italy.....very uplifting."
2,Not a great movie,"As noted in the title, not great. Wasn't expecting greatness, but this movie, the acting, everything was not so good. Rent and watch at your own risk."
2,Ew.,"I am 22 years old and have ADD. I decided to take this as an alternative to prescription medication.I hate swallowing pills and all the reviews said the chewable tablets were SO good - NO. They are not ""so good"" they are truly a disgrace to all things labeled good tasting.Also, they give you diarrhea. And that's never good."
4,"It works, when I can get my son to take it","We have been using these Attentive Child wafers for about six weeks (in combination with KidsCalm liquid multivitamin and whole foods diet, cutting out processed foods, artificial colors/flavors, and sugar)and have noticed an improvement in our son's severe ADHD symptoms; however, he does NOT like the taste of these. In fact he dislikes them so much that I found him hiding them under the couch, behind our corner chair, and under the newspapers... all to avoid eating them. I have to sit with him and literally watch him consume them, or I don't know where we'll find them next. Our three year old on the other hand (we only give him one wafer) loves the taste of the wafers, and asks for them repeatedly until I give him his ""circle supplement"". So I would recommend these, but it's a hit or miss on the taste, depends on the child, and it would probably be best to buy one bottle before committing to a subscription."
5,Question: applicable to high school teachers?,"I just wanted to ask whether people think this book would be helpful to teachers at the secondary level. I mostly teach language arts for kids with mild to moderate learning and behavioral impairments.I want to improve in the ways I managing planning, grading and classroom behavior.Thanks!(I had to add stars in order to post, apparently, but as I've never read this book obviously they don't mean anything!)"
5,Real Brazilian Music - one of the best in the whole world,"I met Roberta's work in 2001 and allow me to say she has 3 ( official ) albums, and some tracks recorded on some other brazilian musicians work... She singing live is simply unbelievable, crystal voice, and she is one of the youngest talents here in Brazil, and the most amazing thing is that she sings real brazilian music, from all regions... not only samba and bossa nova, but Maracatu, Coco, Forró, rythms from Brazil's Northeast region. She is making a rescue of what Brazil's has at its best: its musical roots.Amazing CD - BTW, I recommend the three of them: ""Sambas e Bossas"", ""Braseiro"" and the brand new ( about to arrive soon to US, and already released here...yes!) ""Que belo estranho dia pra se ter alegria"".I had the chance to meet her after one of her concerts, she can sing anything brightly, like only really a few people can. ( and she's not conceited like some ""divas"" are ) :)"
1,Useless,"From a practical standpoint this book is almost totally useless. There are pages upon pages of descriptions of the sections of 7 or 8 major rivers in the area. These descriptions are journalistic at best. Poor maps, poorly organized, and otherwise lacking in the type of solid information one looks for in a guide book. A loser in this genre, voyeuristic at best. I'm no better off for having bought this book."
5,Wonderful book!,A wonderful book for the novice and experienced quilter! Easy to follow directions and excellent photos. Can't go wrong with this book!!
5,Quilts From The Heart,This is a wondefull book for small quilts. Instructions very easy to understand. Book was in excellent conditon. Received very quickly after ordering.
1,Nuance? More like Nuisance,"Needed to convert a PDF file today. Created an account to order the downloadable version thinking I'd get it right away. Paid via PayPal. Received confirmation e-mail but no download link. Checked status...""under review"". Check PayPal..Nuance grabbed the cash already. Checked status...""under review"". Tried to send e-mail asking how long review would take...need to create a separate account just to contact them. Decide to call instead. They say PayPal takes a couple of days to process. I say ""You took the money out of my account already"". I say ""cancel the order"". They say ""Can't do that..it is under review"". They suck. Google Nuance Communications and see the lawsuits and crooked behavior in the past. This is my last dealing with Nuance Communications. I have NO idea what the product is like since they seem to be unable to provide modern online transactions. What do they have? An e-mail box that someone opens up once a day to manually process the orders?"
4,Almost a necessity.,"In this day and age of sending documents back and forth, this program is required for every computer. To scan a document, or produce one in your word processing program, and then send it to a wide variety of computer users, you must use Adobe's PDF format to make sure everyone can open the document. This program seamlessly takes a Word or Excel or even a scanned picture or drawing, and converts it to PDF format for sending to Apple or PC computers. I'd love to be able to create PDF programs right out of Word, but it doesn't happen, so this program is the answer. I have sent legal documents, Architectural drawings, children's doodles, and cartoons using PDF and have no trouble doing it. This program has a learning curve as do all others, but once you catch on to the system it is god-sent."
1,Upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 not worth it,"This product is simply not worth it. I had version 2.0 and then thought, ""oh great, they've fixed the poor conversion issues."" Well think again. Version 3.0 is really nothing different from the prior version. If a document does not come through correctly, Scansoft simply gives you the statement that it was an ""irregular"" PDF file or some statement like that. Conversion is what I purchased the program for. I have had better luck cutting the document into word and then doing some editing from there.This product is dismal. It sure as heck is not worth what it is selling for. To its credit it does convert some documents decently, but those are in the minority. Back to the drawing board for Scansoft. I am done. By the time I waste all this money I could have spent a little more and purchased Adobe to begin with."
5,Blown Away,A friend of mine brought this DVD to my house and we watched it. I had never heard of Monte Montgomery before that night but I was completely blown away by his talent and orginality. There is nothing bad to say about this DVD except it isn't a BluRay. LOL If you are a fan of talented guitar players this is a must.
3,no good but Kai's first,No good but Kai Eckhardt's first studio album that I know of. Kai makes the cheesy album worth ONE listen
5,Great!,"A great bird bath for just a little money. Looks like expencive one.Easy to put together, resistant to the weather but I will put it away for winter just in case."
5,nice item,Great item ! I use it as a bird feeder . Easy assembly......... the 4 pieces are threaded ......just screw them together. Don't want to use the stakes to hold it down... just fill the neck with some stones .
2,"An compelling life story, sadly ill-written.","Much good research work went into this book, but it is badly let down by the often juvenile character of the writing and opinions (on subjects musical and otherwise). A shame as Dennis was an extraordinary personality and a creative, original musician. His songwriting in the period when Brian Wilson slowly abdicated creative direction for the band after the collapse of 'Smile' was undoubtedly the creative highpoint (along with Brian's occaisional work). Nonetheless it is also reasonable to argue that Adam Webb overwhelms Dennis with more of a weight of genius than is strictly fair. Some elementary factual errors also jarr - Smile's 'I Love To Say Da Da' is NOT the same song as Sunflower's 'Cool Cool Water', for example. I went for this book with great enthusiasm as Dennis's story reaches out beyond that of the band in a way that only Brian's has otherwise done, but it's very difficult to really recommend it as an enjoyable reading experience."
4,Fun for a little people.,My son is just turning 5 and this game was right at his level to learn how to use his Gameboy Advance.
3,The Past is Another Country,"A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away- in the pot-smoking time space continuum, I watched this film in wonder. I remember letting more than a few WOW's and Ohh's out of my mouth and have intermittently thought about this film over the passing years. So when I saw it on Amazon, I went for it....what exactly were those ooohs and aaaahs about I wondered?Well, I had a hard time placing the exact moments, but what a gorgeous film! It is, of course, very dated and if it were remade now, CGI would replace the make up.It is a fun romp through the fox hunting culture of English upper crustery, with a cast of fabulous actors in bit parts. Everyone is made up, and though the plot is pretty predictable, it is fun to guess who is who.Loved it."
5,"It's on my ""list"" of favorite movies","While ""The List of Adrian Messenger"" does not follow the book it is still a fun mystery. The cameo appearances of a number of major stars of the era add to the fun. The fox hunting scenes are a return to an earlier time when elegance trumped political correctness. We bought several copies of this DVD to send as gifts to family members. Everyone enjoyed it."
4,Still enjoy it.,"I saw this movie the first time when I was a kid and I was concerned that I would find it laughable as an adult. In fact, I enjoyed it just as much. True, the make-up isn't always the best and certain plot elements probably wouldn't stand up to close scrutiny, but it is still interesting and entertaining. I'm not sure the rumors that the big stars who did cameos in disguise were played by stand-ins is true, Robert Mitchum was easily recognizable to me.The DVD I received had the bluish coloring of a DVD-R."
4,"Viewing ""The List of Adrian Messenger""","I've been a fan of this film since I first saw it, more years ago than I care to remember. George C. Scott mastered his English accent so well, I thought he really was a Brit. It's tops in suspense; you won't even want to take a bathroom break. The disguised supporting players keep you on the edge of your seat until the culprit is discovered.CC would have made it even better for those of us who have old ears, but this movie is a gift for everyone who loves thrillers."
4,Delightful mystery,List of Adrian Messenger is a good mystery. Follow the clues and uncover the culprit. Wonderfully photographed (almost a film noir quality)and the cameo appearances make for a fun ride over the English countryside.
2,Good songs..,But once again not a mixed album. It's really too bad as it takes away from the whole trance-dance blended music thing. I use these albums for exercising and running and the silent pauses take away from my pace. I wish albums like these would list that they are not mixed or blended. Good songs but expected more for over $...
2,"Not my color, too bright.","I should never buy colors online without first seeing them. The photo made me think this color was pearly/frosted, but it's not. It is a very bright pink. Not for me. Fast service though!"
4,Mismaloya Beach Makes It Worthwhile,"I agree with the person who stated that this is not a smooth jazz CD; however, the tune Mismaloya Beach truly makes it worth the purchase. It is one of the best tunes that I have heard it a while."
5,HE'S BACK!!!!....,"HE'S BACK!!!!.... RAY PARKER JR IS BACK WITH A BRILLIANT BODY OF WORK...Time waits for no one EXCEPT Ray Parker Jr! After a long hiatus...well deserved I am sure, Ray has created a brilliant, eclectic body of work worthy of the wait. Something for everyone! Classic Rock...Confessional Blues...Catchy Pop...Smooth Jazz and a moving finale entitled Gibson, a tribute to his son Gibson.Being a brilliant guitarist known all over the world for his incredible rhythmic precision, tasty licks and catchy hooks, it is good to see and hear what's cookin' in the mind and heart of Ray Parker Jr.Having grown up with him in Detroit and having him as a musical mentor (He introduced me to the music business), my heart smiles at seeing him back and DOING HIS THING AS ONLY HE CAN... This CD, I repeat, is really worthy of the wait. It is full of great songs!Dorie Pride"
2,"good start, but...","I found the start of the book rather compelling, but it quickly turns into a rather predictable and simplistic story. His major characters are two dimensional (which made fochs's description of himself as a piece of paper rather ironic) and uninteresting; by the story's end, I felt no connection with anyone or anything in the story as having some semblence to reality. Even the therapist appears contrived. However, I enjoyed the way Evenson set up the story--as a collection of papers from the therapist, letters, and thoughts from the mind of the killer. Very unique and interesting; hence, 2 stars rather than one."
1,What a waste of a beautiful voice,Did Michel Legrand really produce this CD? Those who saw the movie And Now...Ladies and Gentleman will long for the soundtrack after hearing this recording of the songs Patricia Kaas sings in the movie.We are treated to a disco-like synthesizer and monotonous invasive electronic percussion that completely destroy the mood.It is pervasive throughout the whole CD. There is never an opportunity to sit back and relax to her wonderful voice.The producers and arrangers have let Ms. Kaas down badly. She has such a beautiful voice and would have been better served with a more traditional cabaret setting. I hope she does a re-make some day with a different producer as the songs themselves are wonderful selections.
3,Disappointed,"When we ordered this DVD we thought we would have another Frida Boccara. Instead, we found the music was bland. Also, the songs were all sung in English except one verse of one song."
3,Difficult reading choice,"I had to read this book for my Anabaptist Theology class at Fresno Pacific University. I had a difficult time following the plot and getting characters mixed up. I would encourage anyone to try to read this book in only one or two sittings, I had to read it over the course of 2 weeks and I felt that I lost some of the emotions in the novel. The novel raises soem very interesing questions about Mennonite views. I woudl encourage anyone involved with a Mennonite church to read this novel - it gave me great insight to our church."
4,Good Watch,"This is a nice sports watch for a person who is on the go. I brought this watch for a girlfriend not to long ago and she loved it! It's attractive to the eye. Light on the wrist. It's not a watch you would work out in, but it does accesorizes well with sports gear. I recommend this as a nice leisure watch."
2,NIKE WATCH,"I gave this watch as a present...it wasn't working and when I went to put the battery in they supplied, it was the wrong battery. That rots. Now I have to take it to a store and BUY another battery? Not happy."
1,Total Piece of Junk!!,"I bought this product in spite of all the negative reviews. That was a bad idea. The player worked for about the first 45 minutes we used it, and then it stopped working consistently after that. We put in the first movie which played at first, but then it just froze on the screen and never resumed playing. We turned the unit off and back on and tried to start over. When we did this, the unit decided that it couldn't recognize that there was a disc in the player. We tried several different movies with the same result. We tried the original movie over again and it eventually started to play again. However, it would only play for a few minutes before it would freeze-up again. I thought it was freezing up because of the car ride. However, we plugged it into a TV in the house, and the player did the exact same thing. It is a total piece of junk. I hope Amazon stops selling this unit with so much negative feedback."
4,Happy customer,"Of course I read many many reviews on many many products and finally just took a leap of faith that I would be satisified with this product. I am happy to say that it did the trick. I bought this product for my kids to use during a long three day drive. It worked like a charm, it was super easy to install and the kids never asked if we were almost there yet. The picture quality is fine for my kids, the remote worked fine, there is no battery to worry about losing its charge since this system runs off the car battery (could be a problem for airline trips.) Of course it shuts down when the car gets turned off and the kids have to start over and find where they were in the movie, but it was easy for my 9 year old to do and required no assistance from me. The sound quality is good, couldn't hear the motor running or dvd spinning. The system is in the closet until our next long car ride so hopefully it will continue to work in the future, but as of now, I am thrilled with this purchase."
5,I love this thing!!,"We purchased this for our boys for the long car rides. The picture is pretty clear and the volume is perfect. The only problem we have is that the boys (both toddlers) can reach the cord with their feet and they keep unplugging their screens, the cords pull out of the monitors pretty easily. Once they learn to leave the cords alone, we'll be all set. Overall this is an excellent system for the price."
2,DVD player not reliable,"I would not recommend this package. Although the picture quality was very good and we like the features, our DVD player broke after 20 minutes of use. We brought 5 DVD with us on our first trip with it. 20 minutes into the trip the player froze up. It no longer recognized that DVD. 3 of other DVDs would not play at all. Only 1 DVD out of our 5 would work and you had to try several times to get that one to play. We had to buy an different player in the middle of our trip and that one worked fine. We returned the defective unit.If the DVD player did not break, I would have highly recommended this player, but based on the short life span I would never buy another one."
2,Do not waste your money,"We bought this for our toddler son to make the car trips more bearable. At first, this worked fine but then we started having problems with the power shutting off and not coming back on. It's a cheap brand so you can't really expect much from this product. It's been nothing but a headache to our family. Next time around, we'll spend the extra money to get a more reliable one. Seriously...it's just not worth the money or the headaches."
2,Wrong book,The cookbook that is pictured we the one that was ordered but we received a later edition instead. My wife decided to keep the one sent in error.
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"The item title states it is ""BEIGE with Clear Top."" The actual color is NOT beige. It is more of a buttery cream color. The description of the shower curtain should definitely be corrected to reflect the correct color. Otherwise, would've been happy with the purchase."
3,Neat book as long as it's not defective.,"Like others have said, the batteries in this lasted for just a couple of days before the light didn't work. I contacted the company and the customer service was great. I received a reply that day and was sent two sets of batteries. However, they didn't last more than a couple of days either. I contacted customer service once again and they will be sending a replacement book, but I was chastised for letting my daughter play with it during the day. I guess I should have told them that she only plays with it at night and doesn't carry it around with her in the daylight! Good grief. The book itself isn't that great, but the moon feature makes it special...when it works!"
1,Very disappointed,"The text in the book is great.My grandchildren all love it, but of the 4 books I have ordered over the years only one moon actually lit up when I recieved it. The last one I ordered (and it will be the last one) didn't work and I had to buy 4 new batteries that cost $24 dollars for a $10 book. Never again."
1,shoddy construction and hard to use,"I bought 5 of these for my family to use on a trip to Disney World. I only brought one of them home intact. The others fell apart the first day! The fabric attaching the carabiner to the metal part that goes around the neck of the bottle began to unravel before the middle of our first day in the parks. Plus the metal part that hooks around the neck of the bottle was very difficult to get on or off the bottle. The fabric strap is sort of like that used to make belts but it was flimsy and narrow. Because the fabric was narrow, it cut into the shoulder and was uncomfortable to wear with a full water bottle. I would not buy these again nor recommend them to others."
4,Diana Gabaldon's early work,"I bought the book specifically to read the Diana Gabaldon chapter, but have found that I have enjoyed the entire book. I would recommend it for light reading, especially to women with sons."
1,Can You Say Comma?,"I have said repeatedly that I was finished with DS, yet, like some other reviewers here, seem incapable of resisting. I remember when a new DS novel was cause for celebration. Now I look forward to seeing how much further she has slipped!This is by far the worst yet. I also wonder if someone else is writing for her now. I had a hard time reading this due to the poor grammar, total disregard for punctuation and repetition. At least I didn't see any spelling errors.I am a writer myself, working on my first novel. I read fiction as a break from my own writing as well as to continue to work on my writing skills. I resent the fact that this author is able to get away with the kinds of errors that would cause my manuscript to be rejected by any publisher to whom I might submit it.One star is too good for this one. Don't waste your time or money, or even your library rights!"
1,"Wacky, Wacky, Wacky","I am so sick of reading the word ""wacky"" and her going over everything over and over. I have found some really good authors who have become a joy to read. Danielle you're on your way out.I don't think I am stupid, but maybe just plain dumb. I don't know all those Parisian Restaurants and places to go, and I'm not interested. Does she think her characters are special because they are rich. Give me some good honest hard working people who are trying to live good lives. I truly believe she is trying to pretend she is something she's not....even through her books.A Big Disappointment."
1,Steele at Her Worst,"I have been a fan of Danielle Steele since I was a teenager. I have read all of her books and even named my first born after a character in her book ""Palomino'. Fast Forward some 25 years and 60 some books later and I have never been disappointed in one of her books until now. Impossible was boring, the story line was repetative and I had to force myself to finish it. Normally I rush right out to buy her books the day they are released but I have to say now, that I will not do that anymore. I will wait til they come out in paperback or until I can find them at a thrift store or garage sale."
2,Wacky Artist!,"This book was quite repetitive, but very much on track with other Danielle Steel books. I listened to this book on audio and the first ten tracks of this book did not include one single bit of dialogue. It was strictly narration telling us the life story of the main characters. That was a little boring, but then the rest of the book was a little boring and repetitive. It was very frustrating that Liam was so immature and inconsiderate of the main character's professional life. It was funny at times also, especially when Tatiana went to the house in the Hamptons and ""met"" Liam. Overall, the story did have a happy ending and a sweet message, but the phrase ""wacky artist"" and ""impossible"" were used about a zillion times throughout. If you are not a fan of D.S. you probably will not enjoy this book."
1,400 plus pages that could have been written in 100 pages,"Just because Danielle Steel writes it, does that make it worthy of being published? This book is a mess. There are only two reasons that I finished the book; 1) I paid for it, 2) The characters were likable. Otherwise... it was a complete waste of time. How many times can you say the same exact thing over & over again and still have it called literature. Anyway... if you are a fan of the ""real"" Danielle Steel's writing... DO NOT buy this book... waste of money & time."
2,Sometimes I wonder!,I sometimes wonder where DS is when she's writing these stories...I was worn out by hearing about Liam's personality issues and his age difference with Sasha. It got old very quick. I struggled through the last part of the book wondering how I would manage to finish. I'd say the next book needs to be more exciting and unique.
3,Ok but depressing,There were a few spots in the book where I got a little teary eyed because my life at one point in time was exactly like her characters in the book. It was also depressing to me that Sasha would be so dumb to take Liam back each & everytime but hey truthfully that's what love does to us. Well anyways at some points I was impressed w/ the book and some parts I was bored w/ the book.
2,Very Disappointing,"After reading ""Impossible"", I think I've come to the realization it's time to give up buying Ms. Steel's books. Not only have they become very predictable, this one in particular was boring. I found myself skipping pages which is something I rarely do while reading."
4,Pretty good,Came faster than i thought.. Feels like a real gun and looks like a real gun but it was smaller than expected. Not so small but good overall
4,A very good CJazz album,"Alphonse Mouzon's ""As you wish"" album is good. There're great latin influenced ballads like ""As you wish"" and ""Obsession"". Sax player Gary Meek is outstanding on those songs. On ""It's now or Never"" Alphonse Mouzon plays all instruments - a great multi instrumentalist! On the last 6 tracks its more for the showcase of Alphonse Mouzon the worldclass drummer. Tunes like ""If Tomorrow Comes"" or ""One More time"" will please you as drummer or drum fan. ""One more time"" is a great smoking drum solo. This Cd covers everything - great CJazz melodies, Smooth ballads and smoking drum songs with a funky edge."
1,rip off - do not buy,1. The program only lasts five minutes and it costs four dollars. So you are paying almost a dollar a minute.2. The content itself is completely inane. No good information about poker - just a silly story of how phil and the boys play high stakes poker on a plane.3. He reviews one hand history - which is K10 vs A10 and I really didn't find his analysis that interesting.4. You do not get to download the program immediately. I had to ask for it from iamplify customer service. It took a few hours. It should be available immediately.
2,Forgettable camp,"Not as good as Rankin/Bass other specials. The songs in this are forgettable, while the plot drags on (an on, an on). The film could have easily been cut a good 30 minutes, because most of the film is recycled throughout. ""Will Frost melt?"", ""Will Santa ever come?"", and Winterbolt's lame villainy. The real villain of the film is the Ice Genie. He's spooky, and practically responsible for Winterbolt's being. Lady Aurora is probably the film's only other memorable character. The circus crew are forgettable. But it is nice that Big Ben (""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"") and Jack Frost (""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"") make special appearances.Campy fun for a Friday night in July, but not the most memorable of their output."
2,Too much!,"This video features many cute claymation characters, but it's extemely difficult to follow. There's simply too much going on for children (and adults!) to understand the story line. It has a lot of buildup and very little payoff. And it's a little scary for small children."
5,I loved it!,"This is a beautifully-written, interesting story of people in a small New Mexico town. I couldn't breeze through this novel - needed to read slowly so I could savor the delicious phrases in Summer Wood's writing."
5,Falling In Love With Jesus,"This book reveals the mystery of the Song of Solomon, which the author shows is in fact a metaphor for loving the Lord Jesus Christ. Hicks shows how to take your love of Jesus Christ to a whole other level than what I thought was possible.I was reading this book one evening and my work colleagues asked me about what I was reading. I was so happy and inspired to share the insights of this book with them. By sharing what I had learned, I was re-awakened to all the inspiration this book has brought me. If you want to continue to fall in love with the Lord Jesus Christ, you must read this book."
5,A Must-Read for SAN Managers,"This book is truly ""essential"" for all SAN managers. It covers the different platforms and configurations, as well as network standards. It also discusses SAN design issues, cost analysis, installation and testing, and the future role of SANs in business environments. Of particular interst to businesses employing SAN are the book's chapters on the various levels of testing (physical, application, and management layers); web applications of SANs; SAN maintenance; and step-by-step instructions for deploying a SAN. The Appendices contain useful checklists and important vendor information."
1,A poor book,"The book is weak on specifics, and inundated withmeaningless statements. Very few schemes and graphsand setups,of systems, and many generalized devoid ofunderstanding lines. This is a useless book."
2,Not good for an engineer,"Mainly for managers, more concepts. Too much talking about concept stuff. Hard for engineers to read."
2,Received the wrong lures,I didn't realize until after I had opened them that they were not what I ordered. I did not receive the weedless style I wanted but rather a lure with 3 treble hooks that will be anything but weedless.
4,Architecture of the Ages,"Western Architecture has many wonderful examples of old churches, catedrals and government buildings dating all the way back to the Roman Empire. Although this books has many great pictures, it spends very little time on domestic architecture and dosen't deal with many modern buildings."
3,a little confused,"I'm not sure if this is the same book I have due to the cover and title are slightly different. If it is, this book was just what I needed for school and helped me out big time. It also has some good info for anyone interested in history or construction ideas."
5,Love them!!!!,"This is a fantastic gift. The DVD's are wonderful and the price can't be beat. I ordered one and loved it so much I have bought four more for gifts. Go for it, this is GREAT!!"
2,"Not what I expected, but worth it.","The reason I purchased this manual was for the vacuum diagram I was expecting to find. There isn't one. It is extremely detailed on the electrical fundamentals of the bronco and F-series trucks, but you need to know what all the oddball symbols mean. It gives you information on what each symbol is, but you have to go back and forth between pages to decifer the daigrams. I guess if you have experience in the automotive field and have dealt with this before it would be great, but for the do-it-your-selfer like me, this thing only confused me more. When they say ""produced for Fords mechanics"", they mean it."
4,"Nancy drew, Tuned for Danger",My 11 year old loved it and was very pleased to receive it on her birthday. It is also quite challenging to keep her at it for a while.
4,TIed with FIN for second place!,"I loved this game. It has riddles, and is fun! My fav is TRT. FIN is tied with this one, cause I can't chose, then SCK, then MHM. It has great graphics!I can't wait for SSH!"
3,"Not as Good as Others, But still a Good Mystery","This game involves you (playing Nancy Drew) visiting a friend, Mattie Jensen in NYC. Mattie is a Soap Opera star, hoping you can help her solve the mystery of a fan stalking her co-star, Rick Arlen. At first, the fan only sent him ""odd letters"", but now is sending him broken watches, and poisoned chocolates. Only you can solve the mystery! This game is fun and funny!"
4,Nice toy,My 2 year old loves this bus. It has held up pretty well. He broke the door on the side but overall this bus is made of nice quality.
2,There has got to be something better out there!,This book seems incomplete and does little to help Americans with their American accents to pick up on the Polish language and its tone and accent even though it included tapes. Provides basic knowledge but not in a very good format.
1,Polish Complete COurse with Cassettes,Very hard to follow. Having very little success using this book/cassettes.
5,wall mounted hair dryer,"good product, this the second one we have owned. Highly recommend this hair dryer, it is like the one's used in hotels. The first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use."
4,Sunbeam still provides quality products,"I recently purchased the Sunbeam/Oster 1500 wall mounted hair dryer through Amazon, and am extremely happy with it. It's convenient, easy to use, and was very easy to install. I have two of them, one in each bathroom, and wouldn't be without them. They are safe to use (GFCI built in), attractive, quiet, and they're right where I want them, when I want them. My old dryer is now used only for thawing pipes and drying boots in the winter time!"
5,WONDERFUL,"This is the best Don Pasquale that i have heard and seen. Al singers and the orchestra at their best, but Nuccia Focile is outstanding, her singing and acting are really wonderful and funny, and you wish she sings more than she does at this opera. Higly recommended."
3,It's ok,"I bought both Hiragana and Katakana, I thought they were card. the book is ok, nothing to go wild about."
2,Kids fun book.,"I began to learn Japanese over 2 years ago.When first looking for interesting books to help me study, i came across this book. I thought that it would be fun for me to read and learn with colourful pictures. However, I was quite wrong after receiving this book. If you are an educated person who is trying to learn Kana, this book is NOT for you. It offers no real memorization techniques.To be honest I opened and read this book 2 times before never opening it again, it is still in mint condition.If you are actually interested in learning the Kana i would suggest:Remebering the Kana by James HeisigIf you are a parent looking to interest your children in another language, I think this book would be interesting for a child that is less than 13 years old."
5,Nice washcloths,My husband uses these in the shower to exfoliate and he loves them over all other methods of exfoliation. I purchsed another brand of hemp washcloths a few years ago and they were so small as to not be useable. These are perfect!
5,very happy,"I was very happy with all aspects of this product. Arrived on time, in great shape and an excellant movie. Thanks"
2,BIG disappointment,"I bought this album for one song, and as it turns out, that one song is the only thing that would prevent this disc from being a good tabletop coaster. Erase/Rewind is a really great song. It has a great mood, riff, melody; it all just flows beautifully. The rest of the album, however, is rather boring. It all sounds like ""filler"" just to make the effort a full-length album. They would have been better off just releasing an EP or a single of Erase/Rewind and left out the crap that surrounds the song on Gran Turismo. If you are like I was and are considering this CD just because of Erase/Rewind, don't bother. Find a single or get the Thirteenth Floor DVD (good movie, also has the song's video). If you are a new fan of the Cardigans and absolutely love their other stuff, you'll probably like this just for who recorded it."
3,"Recorded good, live, alive","Having listened to the album, I say this is one band that benefits hugely from live performance. The songs are good enough, no doubt, but I find the CD very poppy, rather than the rock cd it should have been.Go see (hear) them live, and you'll get bored with their recordings, much more alive."
4,The Cardigans move out of the sun and into the shadows ...,"The Cardigans took a turn off of their own beaten path with ""Gran Turismo"", shedding the light, lovely easy-listening sound of their previous albums for darker, moodier melodies and a more techno sound that reminded me a lot of Garbage. This album takes time to grow on you, but once it does, it's darn good. Personally, I think their first single ""My Favourite Game"" is one of the weaker songs on the album. I encourage you to buy the CD if you have any interest in this kind of music, because the rest of the songs are really much better. Though I wouldn't rank it among my absolute favorite CDs (in my opinion, ""Life"" is still the best, bar none), ""Gran Turismo"" is a risk that I'm glad the Cardies took."
5,"Hard, detailed reading - but worth it!","This book should be required reading for all members of the US Department of State. The book is not very long, but is crammed full of details regarding the top players in Russian politics. You'll need to stop reading after each chapter to let your brain rest, but it is good reading. Lots of information on the way the Russian government works (or doesn't work). The last couple of chapters are the best, but you need to read the whole book to really get out of them what is there. Suggestion: Take a pad of paper and take notes on which person did what. To me, many of the Russian names are unfamiliar, and yet key players. I had to keep refering back to keep track of individuals."
4,It's a good fellow for the TV,The Phillips FWD798 is a good fellow for the TV. My entertainment room with this Mini Hi-fi System is a great manner to see the movies in HDTV with sourround like a cinema.
4,A Good Basic Print Paper,"This is a very good print paper for the average snap-shooter. I compared it to the Canon Photo Paper Pro IICanon Photo Paper Pro II 4"" x 6"" (100 Sheets) (2737B012), making a side-by-side comparison on several shots I had taken. They both render color well, grain is very similar, and color saturation is basically the same. The Canon paper is somewhat glossier and doesn't have the end tab. I will continue to use it for my every-day snaps."
2,A crappy resident evil 4 clone,"Well let me tell you i hate GTA clones like Roadkill. Now its the freakin popular Resident Evil 4 to get cloned. Sure the graphics are pretty look at, but it's just plain sucky. And if they're gonna clone RE4, at least stick witha 3rd person camera instead of bad loading times and original Resident Evil cameras.Plus when you get grabbed by the zombies, it looks like Tom and the zombies are g@! people. Plus they must have a hate for bald pale guys. There are some scary moments in the game. But it's just a bad clone of a much better game.2 out of 5"
4,Spooky game,Fun game overall. Save points are kind of weird but do not detract from gameplay. Interesting setting with lots of atmosphere and enough claustrophobia to make one antsy just watching someone else play. I recommend giving it a try... especially if you can find it for $20 or less.
3,The suite has it all,"I have enjoyed the suite from Merry Mount for many years; there are five good themes in it. I thought the complete opera would have much more excellent music in it, but I was sadly mistaken. Stick with the suite. My uncle Vincent Coburn saw the opera at the Met many years ago. He told me decades later the opera was terrible. He was right.Some pieces of music deserve their obscurity. I once saw an opera by Hugo Weisgall at the New York City Opera called Seven Rivers to Jordan. Over a forty minute period I watched many people stream out the doors. Finally I joined them and ended up seeing Jane Fonda's film Barbarella at a Broadway movie theater. It was wildly funny.We might not want to admit it, but some things are truly second rate or worse, like the film Plan Nine from Outer Space.The performances are excellent; the opera is a curio. I give this recording three stars because the singers are first rate as is the orchestra. I just wish the opera was."
5,Moving,"This is not a clinical account of a kidney transplant. Rather, it is a very personal account of the author's experience with his sister back in the 1070s. Back then, such transplants were not nearly as common as today. The author recounts the toll his sister's kidney disease had on the entire family and what the family went through both before the surgery and in the remaining decades of his sister's life. One minor criticism, the author does not state which hospital the surgery took place in. I am interested in such details. Nonetheless, this is a very moving personal account of how the donor, recipient and family coped with kidney diseaes, the transplant and it's aftermath."
5,Sarah McCarty does Paranormal majestic,I LOVED this book. Sarah McCarty's books are always good. But this was so surprising to me. A paranormal that grabbed me from the very beginning. I was spellbound. I am late reading it. I can tell that the story was meant to continue as if a in a series. The secondary characters could have a great story in a follow up book.But this book main characters Eden and Deuce are a great Love story that keeps going until the very end. She wants to save him and her child. He wants to save them. And he is so very ALPHA.The love making between these two are HOT. And lengthy...Do enjoy this book!!
5,Cook's Country magazine,"If you have ever watched their show on TV, this magazine is like a paper version. Large heavy-weight paper pages make this a magazine worth saving. Great recipes, with excellent directions and product reviews that are very helpful. First issue came in about 3 weeks and a second followed a week later to get me up to date. I will definitely be renewing my subscription for this magazine.Cook's Country"
2,Buy Cook's Illustrated instead,"I have been a subscribe to CI for many years and are familiar with their database of recipes back to 1993. It is an OUTSTANDING magazine and the finest on the market today, IMO. Then comes Cook's Country. Of course, I gave it a try wondering where the clever people at CI were going next but I think they've lost something of what made them great in this Cook's Country magazine. Over the years in CI, there have been lots of articles taking ""homey"" food and testing to improve (macaroni and cheese, turkey tetrazinni, scrambled eggs, ground beef tacos). In addition, they took lots of recipes one might consider inaccessible to the home cook and created fool proof formulas. I just don't understand what CC adds. CI is more than just recipes, it's like an every other month culinary class. I worry that CC is diluting their energies. I will not subscribe again. Get Cook's Illustrated instead."
5,LOVE THIS MAGIZINE,"I have pared back on our magazine subscriptions, this is the ONE that I have kept for myself, because it is a wonderful reference and resource! THANK YOU!"
5,That punks gotten pretty good.,"Gundam 0083 takes place between Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta Gundam. However, this show was made after both of those shows. Zeon has returned and stole a Gundam armed with nuclear weapons. Now, the Federation must stop the firing of the nuke. The battle basically comes between two pilots, one fighting for revenge and the other still trying to figure out why he's fighting. The battles begin on Earth, but reach space quickly. Any Gundam fan should own this, especially considering the amazing ending. Hail Zeon!"
3,BEWARE THE BOOTLEG/IMPORT,"A lot of anime selling are Imports or Bootlegs! Be careful who you buy from. Research your seller. ALWAYS send e-mails inquiring if it is an import. Ask how many discs there are, it's a tell-tale sign of bootlegs and imports as they will be much less."
4,"Useful, easy to read and room for notes","For years I read and carried the smaller Nestle-Aland twin (25th ed.). This is easier to read, has thicker pages, and more room for notes. All ot the Nestle-Aland critical apparatus and marginal notes are there (but larger). The covering on mine (fabric) is the only negative. If you are going to carry it to class, church, smalll group, etc. then I recommend a Bible cover or recovering it."
5,Best And Affordable Dye-Sub Printer,"This printer is awsome, its only 200 bucks, which is a good price for a dye-sublimation printer. This baby prints lab quality prints im telling you. My only wish is that Sony would make a version that can print up to 5x7, that would be so great. Even if you dont have a computer, with this you can hook it right up to your tv and use the effects and print. It can print 3x5, 4x6, and little mini stickers which are cool. The stickers are just like the ones you can make out those little booths that charge like 4 dollars. You can make your own much cheaper with this, its awsome!"
5,This is NOT your typical yoga video!,"Ira Israel is not your typical yogi, and this video is not a typical yoga video. Its visual are in and of the city. There are plenty of distractions through the video, and yet, through it all, you will still feel your CENTER, and you will see and acknowledge and move through the various distractions. This video is itself therapeutic and refreshing."
2,Poems?,"I fell in love with this author's book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, but this was disappointing. Haddon should stick with writing novels. It was good for him to try a different writing style, but his naturl talent lies in setting up an entire plotline and placing himself in characters' mindsets."
2,do you like tepid coffee??,"The coffee takes so long to brew (I make 4 cups worth) that the first cup is only warm, not hot. Second cup is barely that. Boo!"
3,A classic Drip Pot,"I like Strong Coffee and prefer a French Press, which is a full 'chewy' coffee with all the oils. I got this pot knowing I would need an espresso or a Melita grind for this drip pot. You need to pour two batches of hot water in, first to wet coffee then get most of the flavor out. Best to get the Chemex paper filters, which are effective in getting the Coffee oils out.I recommend this pot for people who like a milder coffee, without bitterness or oil.It truly makes smooth delicate coffee.Getting the water temperature right is part of making Filter and French Press coffee, an Instant Hot Water dispenser or Pot comes in handy. I have gotten away from electric Coffee makers."
4,Minimalist Coffee at its best....,"I find the Chemex 8 Cup Coffee maker to be very simplistic and brews a great cup of flavorful coffee for all of you purist out there. One of the draw backs of owning the maker is that if you do not buy the additional attachments for stove top warming the coffee may cool off too quickly for some peoples liking. However I brew enough for two cups or a large cannister, and enjoy the coffee in one sitting...no problem. My stainless steel traveler holds alot of coffee!!! Cheers!!!"
4,Nice Drill,"Very nice drill. I got a new Dewalt 14.4XRP and was very dissapointed. Extreme chuck wobble, lousy variable speed control and just a poorly built product.I tried several different Dewalts and gave up. I returned it and waited for this drill to become available. I got one of the first ones.The good points are excellent trigger speed control, zero chuck wobble, very smooth sounding internals and of course the V18 battery.The only bad is the weight. It is billed to be the power of an 18 with the weight of a 14. Wrong. It is a tank. Should last forever as most Milwaukee products do but could be lighter.I don't think that there is a better 18v drill out there. I tried alot including the new Makita 18 Lithium Ion. Much lighter but not near as smooth sounding as the Milwaukee. Go with the Milwaukee in this class."
1,Lower Rad Hose,"The item was completely wrong. After putting in all the info for my car, the site came up with this item. I tried several times but each time it came back to this item. The picture was not the same looking hose, but it said it was a generic picture. After purchasing the item, when it arrived, it was not even close to the original hose. Had to send it back and get a credit. That was easy and simple process, but it took two to three weeks to get my credit on the card. I did purchase two hoses, and the upper hose was correct. Just a little put out that afer all the effort I put into making sure this was the right item, it turned out wrong."
2,Not the best,"These shades worked very well for a while, but after a few months they lost their suction. I may try and replace the top two suction cups since the screens are very effective..."
1,HORRIBLE,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! As other reviews stated the suction cups do not stick to your window. I used it literally one day. The suction cups stuck for a 30 minute car ride then the following morning it was laying on the floor of my car. I tried to put it up again but the cups were flat and useless. Definitely a safety hazard as well if your child sits next to the window.
3,Munchkin products overpriced on Amazon,"I really don't understand why Munchkin product pricing on Amazon is not at all competitive with the Walmarts, Targets, Luckys, and Longs of the brick and mortar world. We're talking about a 30% to 500% markup. For example, you can get this product for $7 at Walmart... assuming you want to take your chances with the suction cups. I'll be testing mine shortly."
3,Too Small!,"These would be great- if you have an older, square windowed car! I have a Toyota Prius and they take up only about 30% of the window and barely help at all. They need to make a bigger version. I like the white hot buttons."
3,Secrets Can Kill,"I would reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good mystery!I didn't like the idea of changing disks but It wasn't a big huge struggle or anything! The Characters were a little cartoonish but this was Her Interactives first great Nancy Drew Computer game. The storyline and the plot was excellent in this game,you'll surely be sorry if you dont have this great game to enjoy :)!!!!!!!"
2,Ehhhh...,"For being a game published in 2001, this should have been much better, at least technically, than it was. There was a poor timing match between the visual effects and the sound effects, it was difficult to find where to place the pointer in the save/restore area, the sounds/music were poorly recorded and generated a lot of hissing/static, and the too-frequent need to switch CDs during play were major minuses in a game that could have been ok. When Nancy has conversations with the characters, if the questions asked/answered aren't done in the proper order, the game doesn't progress and you either have to start over or restore a saved game. Also, saving is critical because there are some actions Nancy can take that will result in disaster, necessitating a restore.The story wasn't bad, even for an adult (very similar to the novels) but the technical flaws made this a exercise in frustration."
3,A Mystery Lover,"I love any game that has a mystery in it. Although I like Nancy Drew games, I think this game can be improved. I read the reviews and everyone of them saud it was good, but I think that the game is too short and kind of annoying. On the box it said the game is 20+ hours of fun, it only took me three hours to play without any help. It was annoying because you have to keep switching cds back and forth. I really don't recommend this game, unless you really like playing Nancy Drew games."
1,YUCK,"I did not like this game at all. It is buggy and the Save and Load area is slow and does not work very well. I also dislike the switching back and forth between DISC 1 and 2. Save your money, this game not worth the money. Buy something else."
2,What were they thinking?,"Although the gaming industry has long needed girl games, there is no excuse for putting out a game like this in 1998. Sierra was putting out better games 15 years earlier. The puzzles are too difficult. The interface is terrible. Their more recent games are much better, but I'm still a little bothered by the fact that they don't seem to have any of the old gamers on staff that could tell them how to correctly balance a game."
1,Die Hard Fans Only,"I read Nancy Drew religiously in my early teenage years so I was really anxious to try these games when I heard of them. I really wished I had skipped this though. It was terrible. The graphics are too cartoonish. The characters are flat and one dimensional. It doesn't take very long at all to play. I finished it in a fraction of the 20 hours that the package promises. And the thing I disliked most about it was all of the coded messages. It has a lot of messages hidden around but they do not advance you in the game and do nothing more than give away each of the characters secrets. The messages just kill any suspense in the game. Oh and the game also has two discs and you have to go keep going from one disc to the other throughout the game. It's not too much of an inconvience, but this game just isn't worth it. I don't recommend this game unless you just have to own all of them."
2,No hard evidence,"The author doesn't provide any hard evidence to back his thesis. To put it simply, I don't believe the mob was capable of covering this up. The mob would have had to have the 1)Secret Service 2)Military intelligence 3)the FBI 4)the CIA 5) The Justice Dept (including Robert Kennedy!) 6) The Warren Commission 7) Dallas Police etc. all in its back pocket. Anyone who believes all that is delusional. Jack Ruby himself seems to provide the only credible link, but even this is a bit shaky. Some believe that Jack Ruby's fantasy was to be a gangster and rubbing out Lee Harvey Oswald gave him the opportunity to project that image. Who knows what really happened? It's possible the mob may have been involved somehow or played a role, but I don't think they were the ones in charge."
5,Throwback to the 70s!,"We love this! Henrietta Hippo, Freddie the Frog, Charlie the Owl! Emmy married Doug?! She's hot, how did that happen?The stories are hilarious, the songs are simple, the decor is deliciously 70s!I can't say enough good about this show! It's when TV was simple and dresses were short!"
4,"Gentle, intelligent examination of family, generations and inheritance","Interesting, gentle sad (but not depressing) story of the inevitability of loss and chance.Three siblings decide whether to keep or sell their mother's country home and art collectionafter her death, exploring how we give `things' meaning, and how that meaning changes dueto context, generation, and what we need from them.But while the ideas are intriguing, and the acting good it never quite reached the deepest levelof feeling or thoughtfulness for me.Called a masterpiece by a number of critics, and something close by others, I cant quite go there,but it is an intelligent, quietly moving experience, that I'll probably revisit yet again, since it grewon me on a second viewing."
4,The Art of Profiling,An interesting and informative book so far (I'm still reading this and another book on a similar subject).
4,Baseball's Biggest Bloopers The Games That Got Away,"I read the book Baseball's Biggest Bloopers The Games That Got Away by Dan Gutman. This book was about players that blew it big time! Many of thwe games lost the World Series for the team. But somtimes it just lost the game and the team came back and won the Series. In this book there are 12 humiliating stories that will make even you, fell bad for the players. My favorite story was Herb Washington Designated Pick-Off Victim. It was about an olympic runner that was taken to the Oakland A's. When he got to the Statdium he didn't even know how to play baseball, and teh A's tought him how to paly and then n one game he got picked-off. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes baseball or any sports."
4,Playboy hits the smooth groove,Nice selection of songs across artists both new and old in the smooth jazz tradition. Good compilation and sound. Original artists and songs-- not knockoffs.
4,Good Product,"Good product, works well, delivery was prompt and the price was right. Assembly was fairly easy with a little help and directions were easy to read. Fan is a little noisy though and can be slightly distracting. Other than that I would highly recommend this Treadmill."
1,Tape Cassette Edition: Never finished listening b/c quality of sound was so terrible...,"I love Charles Harrington Elster and his Verbal Advantage series and I think I would have loved this format but the quality of the cassette tape was so awful, that I just gave up in the middle. Big disappointment. I wish Elster would remaster."
1,Wasn't too appealing,"I'm a freshman at my high school. for my Honors Humanities class, i had to read Tooth & Nail. For a freshman, i think reading tooth & nail was completely useless. It got really annoying seeing BOLD words everywhere you read. Also, there were parts that didnt need to be written. They were just written so they can add in SAT words. I didn't even like the story."
1,Is it a baby or is it a snail?,"Cute looking outfit, though nowhere near as much in the photo, but ruined by the fact its ridiculosly experinsive for how cheap and poorly made it is. If you want a baby in a snail suit, buy a different one"
5,Sheepskin Moccasin,"This is an excellent product. I purchased my first pair on a trip four years ago and when I finally worn them out I was concerned that I would not be able to find another moccasin like them. My husband went on line and found an exact match to what I had and ordered them. They are just like the originals and I love them, they are warm and comfortable."
3,Warm for winter.,These mocs are comfortable after they stretched out to fit my feet but I kind of wish I would have gone with the moosehide unlined moc so I could wear them all year.
3,OK Slippers,"These slippers felt comfortable and seemed well made but didn't come up as far on my foot as I thought they would. Since I was looking for something with a bit more coverage, I sent them back."
2,Fun action figures but not durable,"My son was so excited to get this toy until we put it together and it continually fell apart. Eventually it was put away and we kept the 3 figures it came with out. My sons love playing with those, we put them with the traditional legos duplos. Mega Brands dont fit well or stay together the way Lego brands do."
3,Good Idea...Needs Some Work,"My boys (2 and 3) love Spiderman and blocks, so I thought this would be great for them. They love the figures, but become frustrated when the blocks do not stay together. The various blocks don't seem to fit together very tightly (unlike the Bob the Builder blocks made by another manufacturer which stay together well...allowing for movement and action). I'd give the toy five stars if the blocks were ""stronger"" and fit together better. They still have fun playing with the figures and creating different play areas for them."
1,BEWARE PATIENT OF DOCTOR HARRIS,How could you treat me all these years and have Aids kissing me and touching me and calling me pop. Lovell you hurt me deeply and I used too brag about my doc and Dr. Harris this and Dr. Harris that. I can't understand you. You should be ashamed of yourself. I'm so hurt I called my lawyer after someone let me hold that rubbish of a book I loved your father and I hope you burn in hell for what you have done and YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM ME...
3,Mildly entertaining but you could skip it,"Yes, this video is entertaining but it could be better, it moves kinda of slow. I'm hoping that my 20 month old will take more and more interest in it as her vocabulary expands."
2,Badly written,"There really isn't much to be said for this book. It is written in the style of The Night Before Christmas but the wording is very tedious and does not flow at all. As another poster mentioned, it needs a rewrite.This book does not mention god, rather dances around the topic. Personally as an atheist (yes, one who enjoys the season), I was glad for that and yet the message was very watered down. There was no warmth and joy, or perhaps it just seemed that way because I so hated reading it.I usually don't hesitate in choosing Berenstain Bears, but now I'll look twice."
5,Love it!,"This is an excellent series full of suspense, humor, and creative plots.The characters are memorable and entertaining. It's a feel good read. Want more!"
4,Stimulating illustrations,"This is a favorite of my 9-month old son who consistently chooses it for us to read together and regularly pages through it on his own. The illustrations are bold, colorful and stimulating and the animals represented take us beyond the more common dog, pig, duck varieties to animals including the toucan, koala and camel. Its popularity with our son is motivating us to buy the whole series."
5,I Can't Let You Go,"Another hit single from the king of vocal trance, Ian van Dahl. It has the simplicity of Reason, and there is true emotion in lead singer Annemie Coenen's voice. The lyrics lack the slick style of Ivd, but they still impress. This song gets better with every additional play, and the single makes a coveted addition to any trance collection."
1,Merchandise deffective,I gave this product as a baby shower gift. To my surprise the mother calls me back yesterday after the shower to let me know that the item is deffective. I will be picking up the item from the mother to be tomorrow to return to company. I have never been som embarressed in my life. The motor squeaks and sounds like a lawn mower. There is no way any baby could enjoy this swing.
5,Perfect,"The product was delivered as described and in timely fashion. As for the season itself, it is nice to be able to watch the seasons in order and to watch the TAPS team grow with each progressive season."
5,wisker biscut,pretty good wisker biscut u cant get a better one for the moneyi used mine for a sling bow if u dont know what that is its a sling shot that shoots arrows out of a wisker biscut nad it works pretty good for small game and in some ways big game if u make it right but any way the wisker biscut work perfecally
2,Don't get these for taste,"Unless you truely need to have organic and for some reason must eat croutons, I would not recommend these. They are very bland and very hard. We would prefer to have no croutons on our salad before these."
2,Long winded,A tough read. Way too many details and she is all over the place. I bought tghis book as a required text for a class and I would not recommend it again.
4,Great Bible for History Enthusiasts,"As a high school history teacher, I really enjoy this bible. It has a lot of maps, timelines, related events, and historical references throughout. It doesn't make a very good Sunday morning church bible because it's not laid out like a traditional bible. It's divided into epochs and is chronologically correct. Traditional bibles are not."
3,A Perfect Rip Off,"If there was never a band named Pantera than this CD would be really good. Unfortunately we have heard these riffs before and those vocals could be Phil's long lost tapes. Obviously the lead guitarist is no DIME but the riffs are way to close to Pantera's. These guys should just change their name to Cowboys from Hell and become a Pantera cover band. Overall I like the CD, but when you listen to it you kind of feel cheated like Pantera was having an off day. I mean all the elements are there but it still seems fake or watered down. So if your young or have been living under a rock and have never heard of Pantera then you will enjoy this cd. If not, I would probably say pass on this one and go buy the Pantera catalogue of cd's instead. You'll be much happier!!!!"
3,"A Competent Survival Horror Game, But Little More.","The game, from a gameplay standpoint, is pretty good. Controls are responsive and the gunplay is satisfying. It also has an interesting location, taking place on a boat at sea during a storm, which actually plays into the gameplay with the swaying of the ship constantly impeding the player's aim.Sadly, little else about the game impresses all that much. Pretty much nothing in terms of interesting characterization or story, voice acting is passable at best and, despite a rather interesting location, I felt the atmosphere largely lacking.Worth a try for hardcore, survival horror fans, though do go into it expecting greatness."
2,item was not item pictured,"what I received is not the item pictured. Very disappointed. The item in the picture shows about 3 times ""levels"" as the one I received."
1,Bad News,Don't buy this if you want the originals. This is second rate stuff. Avoid. You've been warned.
2,Not worth the $,I purchase the unit out of desparation. Bought a big Mitsubishi TV one year before DVI inputs so had to find a component HD unit. There was no noticable difference in image quality and it had some scenes where there were lines across the dark section of the images. But the biggest issue was that after 5 or 10 minutes the optical output quite working. Just gave up and returned it and ate the 15% restocking fee and my shipping costs.
1,Chaotic,Heidi writes this book like a car careening out of control. She lives her life without order and self-control. God is not.a God of chaos. Terribly written.
5,wonderful,they are great a little cheesy but so much better than all the [...] that you get in shows today. I am always amazed at how we only have shows that are full of sex or cussing. It was a pleasure to watch ordered more.
4,Great TV Series,"Great TV series. I watched Perry Mason growing up. I had forgotten how good the scripts were and how professional the actors performed. All cast members were cast perfectly. I also enjoyed watching the other actors that played in the series, many of which went on to become huge stars. One such actor was Robert Redford.I cant't wait for the release of seasons 5,6, 7, 8 and 9."
5,"Although pricey, comprehensive and worth the money.","I am currently using this book as a supplemental text for a course in Psychopathology I am taking at Cleveland State University.The explanations of the various disorders are sometimes dense for the beginning graduate student, yet there is much to learn as each chapter not only discusses the etiology, but also various treatment approaches for each illness.Would I recommend this book? Depends on what kind of student you are. If you are the type who is interested in learning only what is necessary to get through a course, this book will bore you. But if you are looking for a resource that will take you deeper, and be useful to you long after you leave grad school, then I would invest the money. Having a well-stocked professional library is essential to good practice. This book should be on that is on your shelf."
2,Murder Most Plentiful,"The bodies really pile up in this mystery novel. It seems that whenever the author ran out of ideas he decided to kill off another character. None of the characters are well developed. The novel also contains elements of the romance novel, indicative of the publisher, Harlequin."
1,Ad Heavy,This publication seems to focus more on real estate ads than critical reviews of those locations we might be interested in.
5,Latex band is fabric-covered!,"This Playtex bra, Style 4210, has a fabric-covered elastic band! I am very sensitive to latex, so having the band under the cups encased in fabric is a must have! (The straps are all fabric.) I hope they continue to make this bra, because it is hard to find a bra with a fabric-covered band."
5,Love it!,Had discovered this style at the outlets but they are a good hour and a half ride from me...so when I decided I needed more...I did a search..and this bra...at this particular seller was a good deal.The bra is pretty...but more importantly...fits very well..and is comfortable. This seller offered the best price I could find on the web.
2,Big cups,"Cups are not A cups, too big. Hook in back digs in. I won't buy these again. Hard to find 38 A though."
3,Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Biography,"For the most part, this book is excellently written--even poetically written, at times. For the person who already appreciates and even worships Henri Cartier-Bresson (as I do) this book is satisfactory. For everyone else, however, this book lacks several important things:1. Actual reproductions of the photographs specifically mentioned.2. Aesthetic evaluations of the photographs mentioned.3. Critical analyses by people not the author.----Irving Orenstein"
4,Great conversation starter,"Great conversation starter but after a few times - the subjects are no more something new...We used for playdates, during dinner, raining days. We had fun. I just wish there were more cards...The concept is great and the price is good too!!"
2,I wouldn't send it as gift,"the delivery time was very fast but the coffee taste is like Mac Donald or 7-11 coffee.Based on customer review, I thought this coffee was very fine coffee so I gave to friends as a gift in the past.My friends didn't mention about the coffee taste. I expected to hear ""the coffee tasted great""I should have tasted it before I gave to a friend. Now I know why !"
5,A Tight MIX of Jungle Flava,This CD can drop some phat beats and tight rolls. I bought the CD with some doubt because I have never heard Aphordite before. But now it is one of my FAVS. If you love D&B get this CD you will not be disapointed! NUFF-SAYD---thePSYchoFUnk has SpOkeN
5,Cute durable book,This book is great and very colorful. I got it to give away and couldn't part with it. the touch and feel parts are really great.
4,fix the typos,"I love this series of books. I have learnt more about the history of England than I ever did at school. However, my enjoyment is marred by the number of typing errors in these kindle books. It is getting worse with each new book and it is truly annoying to stop the flow of my reading to try and work out which word was intended."
1,Disappointment,Bought it for my dad. He returned it. Didn't like the music at all. Not the Prima music he remembered.
3,"Real-life ""M*A*S*H"" experiences during WWII","A published journal of a non-combatant US soldier serving only a few miles from the front lines in World War II Europe in one of the first air-evac hospitals in history. It follows the author from training in Scotland, D-Day preparations along the English Channel, air raids in Normandy, the fierce siege of Metz, the fresh aftermath of Bastogne, further into Germany, then back home to the US.Though published in 1992, the manuscript was assembled in 1945 while still in Europe under the approval of the author's commanding officer and contains verbatim record of his ""in-situ"" emotions and thoughts. Its vignettes of what life was like within sight of the explosions and fighting at the front, but only experienced second-hand from a surging stream of wounded men, are the predecessor to what inspired the show ""M*A*S*H"". A few pictures are included."
2,A good general overview -- but that's it.,"I studied this book cover-to-cover in preparation for the 70-152 exam and don't feel it contributed much to my passing the exam. It covers all the relevant areas but tends to avoid detail in most sections. Some sections (like DHTML and scriptlets) are over-emphasized for the weight they carry on the exam. My background in IIS and ASP/VBScript got me about 75% of the way to passing, and the Transcender did the rest. This book might be useful if you're already very comfortable with all the subjects and you want to know exactly what topics are on the exam, but for an exam prep alone, this book is insufficient."
2,"Semi-useful, but not for the exam","For some reason, Microsoft Press just doesn't seem to be able to write training guides that correspond to their own exams. The book itself is only fair. The case study is useful, but I never managed to get all the code to work. The explanations are sketchy at best. As an exam guide it is highly inadequate. The book only covers a fraction of the topics in the exam. Unfortunately, at this time it is the only MCSD book for InterDev available."
1,Not a good book for exam 70-152 studying,"This book does an ok job describing the technologies surrounding web applications, but as a study guide it was no help at all. I read it cover to cover, and it was a complete waste of time. The exam focused on things that were not even covered in the book. To understand things at a high level, the book is ok. The only problem at the time I am writing this review, there are no other books or practice exams available to use to study for this particular exam. But when another study source comes out, I would say choose anything over this book."
5,My thoughts,"I've downloaded and scene almost all of the episodes on this DVD , but I must say this is a great collection worth buying , if you like the Halo games . you'll laugth out loud when you watch this ."
1,Delonghi Toaster Junk,We purchased a Delonghi 4 slice toaster. It worked fine for about 14 months and then the right side would not stay down for toasting. I called the company but they were no help. The closest repair facility was 120 miles away in Philadeplhia. They will not ship parts to an individual. I would not recommend purchasing one.
3,"Nice toaster, but not without problems.","This is a very nice toaster, but there are a few problems with it. It is hard to adjust the settings to find the happy medium between toasting and burning. Also, the brushed steel/stainless steel look an be difficult to keep clean (fingerprints mostly). Also, it is very pricey when compared with other toasters."
1,cheap stuff,"Did not last 2 years.Company told me that they could not do anything because the warranty was over and they didnt have the parts anyway ,bought in Dec 2009."
3,Looks good but falls short on it's main function!,"This is a big toaster... you'd think for the size it would do some serious toasting, right? Wrong. 9 times out of 10 I have to put my toast in twice on the highest setting... Annoying! A little!But... I tried a few others and this one is the easiest to keep clean and really the best of limited options..."
1,Non existent quality,"We ordered this toaster despite the price expecting high performance. It has never browned evenly, and there is no consistency in onsecutive settings. We could have bought four toasters for the price with better results. Worthless!"
3,Does not toast evenly,"Toasts differently each time, not an even toast of each slice. Other than that, design looks great with other SS appliances, and I like the tray for crumbles."
4,I just love it,"They did a great job, The product was a Christmas gift, and the best toaster mom ever had. She loves it and thanks me all the time.William Moore"
3,It's OK,"My old DeLonghi finally broke after many years of good service, and I wanted another 4-slice toaster in stainless steel, so naturally I selected this one. It's OK but some earlier reviewers were correct -- it tends to toast the bread a little too light, and I don't mean only frozen bread or bagels. It's adequate and I love how it looks, but I keep it on the highest setting and sometimes have to pop the toast back down for a second time."
3,Obscure classic if you happen to have a Ph.D.,"George R. Stewart was a historian at UC Berkeley in the first half of the 20th Century. He's mostly known for his history of the Donner Party, ""Ordeal by Hunger"" and his brilliant post-apocalyptic novel ""Earth Abides,"" but he also wrote comedy. Doctor's Oral is gallows humor about the Ph.D. Admission to Candidacy exam. It is good, dry humor, but it is probably best not to read it if you are currently preparing for your candidacy exam. It would just make you nervous."
1,misleading photo,"misleading photo , way too expensive for just one brush. I. i suggest people either buy in stores or spend almost 30 mins reading product description. Stay away from such listings."
5,Great storytelling,"Incredible cinematography and storytelling with a talented cast that leaves you feeling like you know these people, and care about what happens to them. Slow, filled with dialogue and long cinematic shots, if you prefer transformers, this is not fo you."
2,Previews are better than the movie,The writing is really awful. The movie gives you brief flashbacks into Butch Cassidy's life but that doesn't start until midway through the movie. You don't learn about the plot until the end. The movie never justifies the ending. In the beginning all they do is curse -- call me crazy but I don't think the F word was around in the wild west. Really wanted to see it and struggled to finish it.
4,"Not great, but pretty damn close","I liked the traditional western ""quest for redemption"" plot line set in a non traditional setting. Maybe a little light on action but plenty going on plot-wise to keep you interested. Visually it reminded me of the (1969) Wild Bunch or probably any other Peckinpah western. Definitely much higher quality acting and cinematography than most recent movies in this genre."
3,Not much interest yet...,"My son seemed interested in this at the store, but then never again. He is 8 months old and has other wooden toys from haba and similar brands he plays with. I put this one in the ""rotated out"" toys to try again later. I will say this looked like it was made of a higher quality than other M&D; toys of which I'm not normally a fan because they look like cheap Chinese knock-offs of better wood brand IMO.Update, my son is 13 months old now and I think I've seen him play with this only once or twice. It's on a shelf with his wooden vehicles which he plays with often. He just skips this one."
5,"Truly ""The Truest Pleasure""",I loved reading The Truest Pleasure!! It takes pride on my shelf along with my other loved books. It was wonderful how Robert Morgan potrayed the lives of Ginny and Tom. The way Ginny and Tom communicated had too many similarities to my own life. I am now reading Gap Creek and I will be looking for my next book my Robert Morgan.
5,Vibrant and Briliant,"Is a great movie to begin with. It is even better in BR. They did such a great job with the colors in this movie and the BR disc brings them out even more. I just wish I had an LED lit, 120hz HDTV to watch it on. Still looked amazing on the 60hz LCD. I also recommend ""Fearless"" on BR as well. Believe it or not, the picture in these two BR movies is some of the best I've seen. Jet Li has always been one of my favorites. I don't buy many BR movies but this one was a must have. If you have not seen the movie, it is a great story and the kung fu action is good (a few crazy parts but overall good)."
1,Tarantino should be put in prison.,"An artistic tragedy. Tarantino and Weinstein should be put in prison for what they've done to this masterpiece. First they delayed the release so it wouldn't compete with the garbage Kill Bill franchise. Then they changed the original subtitles, dumbing down the story for the half-wits who control Miramax. Look for an Asian DVD release if you want to really see this work of genius. And please don't give your entertainment dollars to Quentin or Harvey, remember that they were almost done for, then a million morons paid to see ""Basterds."" Now we have another decade of @*%&! to look forward to from these two hacks."
3,Not As Good As Crouching Tiger,"I cannot help but compare this movie to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Please do not get led on by the television ads saying ""Every bit as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" It is not even close. I found it difficult to like any of the characters in the movie, including Jet Li's role (Broken Sword was O.K.). The plot was slow. As the Emperor and Jet Li went back and forth, comming up with theories, I found glancing at my watch every five minutes. I don't think movies should do that to the veiwer. For all of its shortcommings, Hero made up for them to a point with its breathtaking visuals. Especially the fight between Jet and Broken Sword on the lake. Over all, it was an alright movie, but not one that I would bother to see again."
1,Was this meant to entertain or bore?,I was expecting big things from this movie and instead was seriously let down. I don't see how watching the same sequence of events 3 different times with only a slight change every time you watch it. It was repetitive and got boring extremely quickly. It would have been better off as a short film and cut it to 30 minutes instead of nearly 2 hours.
2,An easily foregettable film .....,"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of what this DVD wasn't .... what it wasn't was a remake of 'Crouching Tiger' which I certainly will never forget .... that walking on leaves stupidity was only outdone by the poisoning scene that dragged out more than Steely Dan's Revival disks ...OK so Hero has what the great modern Chinese films have, colour, pagentry and a sense of history. What is lacks is writing skill and character development....in trying to appeal to a broad based US audience I guess the writers and directors took the brains out of the movie .... At least they didn't walk on water since there's only one character in my mind that can bring that off convincingly !!!Forget it ..... wait for this on Showtime ....."
1,A less than decent movie,"When I saw first saw hero, It was an import version the one of my friends had brought back from china in early 2004. I really wanted to see this movie, but after I watched it, I felt disappointment and irritation over the over written script, and the poorly delivered outcome. The movie had too much going on at times, and not enough going on at other times. At least in crouching tiger, hidden dragon, it never had too much going on. I also disliked the message of the movie, it seems forced upon the audience. While I wont give away the ending for anyone who wants to see this movie, I will say this: it seems like propaganda, like a movie that the chinese government wants you to see. But that is just what I thought. Oh, and by the way, my friend didnt like the movie eather."
2,Lousy,"First, while I can't explain it, this movie is like a piece of mainland China propaganda directed at Taiwan. If they hadn't lost me before the ending of the movie (And they definitely did), they would have lost me with how they concluded it. It tried too hard to be artistic over everything else and suffers for it. Perhaps 2 stars is 1 too many."
2,"Visuals yes, story no","While Hero does deliver on the visual front, the story falls well flat. My first reaction upon it ending was to think we had been in our seats for at least three hours, I was shocked to see it was well short of that time...that should indicate the quality of the story telling. What could have been accomplished in a much more streamlined fashion is painfully dragged out. While the camera work is impressive, its nothing more than eye candy, because there is little to no substance behind it."
4,Poetic........hunting......stunning......,A poetic tragedy of ancient heroes....with hunting music and stunning visuals.I deduct one star because the dialogues don't sound very natural.But still highly recommended.
5,"""Hero"" is the BEST!!!","This DVD was a gift to a friend.. to my ""best"" friend!A ""must see"" movie, I was able to see at the theatre, BIG screen.Both the ""story"" and the ""music"" express a deep meaning of connectionthat made me ""cry"" during many parts of the movie..HERO is ""moving"" on many levels for an adult viewer.It's not a ""video"" game or a ""Bruce Lee"" action movie.Very ""spiritual"".. and a great gift to a ""best"" friend."
4,Alot of people did not like this movie but i certainly did.,"I am a Jet li fan and i am also a true martial arts fanatic, having said that i would like to mention that i try not to be bias, i love this movie this movie is raw poetry and creative imagination in motion, you must embrace the substance of the story and understand the perception created for the ordiance then you must exercise creative thinking along with basic logic, right! there is the recipe to enjoy this movie, i have no complains and i would recomend that you view this yourself don't let anyone tell you about this experience.as wonderful, stunning, creative movie this definitely on my classic list."
5,One of the Very Best,"I just love the Chinese martial arts movies. ""Hero"", along with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Hidden Daggers"" are excellent representatives of this genre. However, in addition to the martial arts beauty of these movies, is the cinematography - the use of colors and whole-screen visuals is superb!"
4,Niiiiiice kung-fu flick,"Great action throughout the movie, and an even better story. Jet gives one of his better performances in this one. The visuals are amazing and the fighting is in incredible. Great movie"
3,Liked But Didn't Love...,"Although I enjoyed this film way better than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" I didn't enjoy it as much as ""House of the Flying Daggers."" I'm not a big fan of the far-fetched fighting sequences. I can go along with them to a point, but I can't not question how someone can fight off thousands of arrows with just the long sleeves of their outfit and not only survive, but without a scratch basically too. All that aside, I enjoyed the multiple versions told of one story. And the imagery was really beautiful at times."
5,A fascinating Woman,"Anne Boleyn continues to fascinate. A woman of wit, intelligence and a feminist in her time. She won a king's heart but incurred his wrath. A life cut short, a child deprived of her mother. A true tale of intrigue, corruption and manipulation. A cast of interesting characters vieing for power, wealth and fame."
5,Best book on Leadership that I ever read,"This book is a must read for anyone in a leadership position or one who aspires to be a leader. It is also a great book for students that will enable them to set the correct moral tone for the rest of their lives.As a Naval Academy graduate and former Marine Officer I wish that I had read this book when I was younger. The insight into the proper ways of handling difficult and every day situations are not matched by any book on leadership that I have ever read.I checked the book out in our local library and before I finished it I ordered 7 copies from Amazon to give to my friends and colleagues. Today, I just ordered 10 more. I tip my hat to Mr. Kaltman for an outstanding job. I have also come to appreciate General Grant as a man of honor and outstanding leadership."
3,"Good book to browse, but very shallow","Mr. Kaltman essentially takes a large number of conventional wisdom management and leadership maxims (and, in some cases, cliches) and matches them to episodes from the Life of U. S. Grant. This makes for a book that serves well as coffee-table browsing type of book; one can flip it open to any page and read a couple of pages on some episode and the lesson of the story and put it back down with a half satisfied ""Hmm!"". As history the book adds no real insight to the life of one of America's premier generals and you've probably heard the leadership principles it contains espoused before in other venues."
4,Good leadershipship principles by U.S. Grant.,"Grant may have been a poor President, but he was a great General. This book expounds the leadership principles of his war years. Grant was not only decisive, but he could also admit to mistakes. His treatment of his fellow officers shows he was a born leader. In three years, he rose from being a store clerk to a four star general. He did this using his courage, common sense, and good decision making. Lincoln may have saved the Union through his political leadership, but U.S. Grant saved it militarily with his good leadership.This is a easy to read book. The book is in excess of three hundred pages, but most of the pages are not full. Some two hundred and fifty principles are detailed in the leadership of U.S. Grant. Too bad Grant did not use some of these principles in his Presidency."
4,Home run,Kaltman has done the research for you and put it all in a great lesson by lesson format. Any leader can refer to this book for day to day operations.
2,The word is Zondervan,"I don't want to rehash the thoughtful comments of the other reviewers... I saw a TV special about one of the people included in the book and that led me to buy the book... I neglected to note the publisher, Zondervan, an evangelical Christian publisher....that in itself lets the reader know where the author is going with his research. As a nurse I have been priviledged to hear such accounts first-hand; regardless of the ultimate nature of this human experience, one cannot avoid being deeply touched...what is saddening to me is that such experiences then become the 'battleground' for belief systems that are uncomfortable with mystery, and a rather small minded claim on knowing the 'truth' for the rest of us!"
2,Bad Piano,I have just listened to that CD. I am disappointed. Unfortunately the piano is electronic and it seems played by computer or MIDI sequencer.What a pity! All the tracks would be better with a real pianoforte.
2,NO!!!!!!!,On the whole I wasn't satisfied with the book. In all fairness I did take DE as a summer class. Maybe that's why I don't have fond memories of this book. I'm not an engineering major. I'm not physics major. I found the books almost constant reliance on engineering and physics to introduce concepts to be very disappointing. I think the book lacks balance. Also I found some of the examples lacking. I found better explanations of identical topics in my calculus book (Larson) and in my linear algebra book (Kolman). An engineer that I know tried to use the book to review some stuff and found it fairly useless. Dover makes some good cheap DE book.
2,Spare yourself the pain,"This book starts off alright, but then it takes you on a ride through hell. Some of the chapters lack examples. The authors will ramble on about the theory and give you one example that is irrelevant to the exercises (usually an example that is extraordinarily easy). Then come the exercises, and if you get stuck, lo and behold, tough luck get another book or someone else to help you. While a few of the chapters are well written, there are other books in which ALL the chapters all written (like pollard and tenenbaum, which is also nearly 1/6 the price). All in all, I would not recommend this book to first-timers."
1,Buy a different book!!,"We use this book here at Central Michigan University and I must say that it is one of the hardest math books to comprehend. It's wordy and has an overabundace of theorems, proofs, as well as example problems that are variable based. The authors make minimal usage of actual numbers. This book is probably chosen by professors for its computer applications rather than its instruction in learning differential equations. I am in the process of looking for another book to help me learn this stuff."
5,"Excellent research, wonderfully developed characters","Author goes against formulas of historical fiction in that main character is a slave. Excellent historical research; African Americans are treated with great dignity and respect. Discusses Christian conscience at darkest time in nations history.Two highlights of the book are scene when Rosa meets Joseph on the ""street"" (blows you away!) and when Joseph realizes what freedom in Christ really means! As African Americans, we begin to appreciate why our ancestors clung to religion. Lastly, read the book with a friend/friends. You will want to talk about it. It's rich with detail and very well written. Enjoy!"
5,"If you like Queen, You will love this album","This is simply the best of Queen. First it not only has all of the group's biggest hits, but it has the one that rocketed them to fame, Bohemian Rhapsody. Freddie Mercury at his best. You will not be disappointed in this one."
3,Queen is Queen,"I wasn't a Queen fan before, and I'm not really one now. However, this was a good place to start."
1,not as advertised,"It clearly states that this album download includes Bohemian Rhapsody , Fat Bottom Girls and Another One Bites The Dust but these songs were not downloaded to my queue ."
3,snap-on gearhead garage,"I would love to play this game, but I have been unable to get it to work with windows and I have been unable to download the ""fix"" from the manufacturer.My online help team tried for 4 hours and had to give up. While they eliminated viruses and straightened out other problems they could not get the game to play at all.I haven't returned it because my grandson wants to play it, and we are hoping to come up with a fix we can use."
3,Pretty good,"This was very helpful for me, because I barely know French. This was fun, and informative! However, adults may not find this product is the best out there. Another thing I didn't like about this program is that the lessons for colors included conjegaions for various verbs, adverbs, and other random things. Also, something that was helpful was that they gave you a list of the words, and conversations in English and in French ( however I didn't recieve this with the package I had to print it from there website). It was all in movie form, exept for the quizzes. I also recommend French Now 9.0! It is even more informative, and you learn french faster!"
3,"Interesting, but not much new","The author obviously cares about his patients; and there are some interesting and important points raised: e.g. that there is medical evidence that bereavement can in itself sometimes be fatal. There are also some very crucial, salutary and courageous points made about certain controversial issues. But for my taste the book overall contains too little about patients or medicine and too much vaguely 'inspirational' writing."
4,I like it,"If your looking for suds this is not the shampoo for you, but that's the kind it is, no sulfate. It does pretty good to get my hair clean."
4,the shampoo,"The name of the shampoo tells much. It has a great herbal fragrance which even us manly men will enjoy! I don't shampoo daily, so I can't speak to how it performs daily. I shampoo every other day and that's enough even for my fairly long, thick, wavy-curly hair. I exercise daily, so after a day without it my hair needs a cleaning! Other reviews advised that this shampoo is not for thick hair. It's true unless you use a conditioner, as I do. After applying the conditioner, my hair is pretty tame and compliant. This is good stuff."
3,Completely pleasant,"This is a bit of a departure for the group, in that it's a little more ""band"" sounding and cohesive than the previous three CDs. It's a style that really suits Sarah Cracknell's lovely voice, and tracks like the single ""Sylvie"" are truly beautiful. The one reason I'm not rating it a little higher is that, while pleasant as a whole, there's not a lot that really stands out on the CD. It's a very nice CD to listen to, but I found it hard to get very involved with emotionally. That said, it's still a worthwhile addition to your library and an interesting chapter in the career of one of the most individual pop groups to emerge in the 90s."
3,"Good workout video, but the pace is too fast for me","This is an excellent workout video that includes both cardio and strength training. However, I really have hard time catching up with the instructor even though I consider myself athletic. This is definitely not for beginners of BOSU. As a start, I have to do the various moves one at a time just to get acclimated with the steps and to build up my balance while on the ball."
4,Great if you're interested in media history,"I saw this movie in college (I studied Mass Communication) and really loved it. I have been trying for some time to see it again. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Alan Freed, the history of Rock 'n Roll, or in general, American pop culture."
5,No VHS/DVD is a Real Loss,"I find it hard to believe there is no market for either a VHS or DVD of American Hot Wax. Although I'm 60, and not a rock n' roller, I found this to be a movie that could be enjoyed over and over. The music and the realization that this music oppression did occur is excellent viewing. Hopefully I won't have to buy one of the pirate copies that are floating around."
3,Loud,I just received two of these speakers and there decent the bass could have been better but they are only good if your using them at max power...good for outside parties not indoors
2,too expensive to follow,I checked this book out from the library. It does haveg good information but the products are way too expensive. There does seem to be a sales pitch going on. Research has shown that skin quality is heredetary. I would not buy it.
3,GOOD BOOK,"READ IT , BUT I DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH, GOOD BOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL REALLY WORK ON SUGGESTIONS GIVEN"
3,Charles Dickens....a review!,This is an adequate review of Charles Dickens life but a little on the boring side as the narrator is quite monotone. The autobiographical detail about the author is impressive but the format it is presented is a touch dull. The one excellent point of this product is along with the documentary there are two films; Oliver Twist (1933) and The Old Curiosity Shop (1934). For this reason alone it is worth buying. This is a good DVD for classroom use as it serves its purpose of teaching students about the man Charles Dicknes and his life. Also gives the opportunity to show two classic film versions of Dickens' stories.
1,Missing DVD,i would love to review this product but believe it was stolen from my mailbox. the postal service said it was delivered but my carrier can't remember if he left it or not. i plan to reorder it.
2,All The Flowers Are Dying,"Not bad, just not all that good or up to early and mid series Scudder. Block seems to rely more on graphic sex and gore (as in Small Town) than on the strong characterization that made Scudder an outstanding series character; deeply flawed but rigidly ethical (to his own deeply held code of ethics). In the last few books he has become too clean. Block has walked away from what made Scudder outstanding. I've been a major Scudder fan, but not this one. Plus, half the book is printed in italics, which is a nusance to read. This appears to be the last of the Scudder series and, though I'll miss Matt, his exit, at this late date, is appropriate.Good friends pass on. Rest In Peace, Matt!Richard A. Herman"
1,Dead flowers,"I have read everyone of the Matthew Scudder novels. Trust,this one is the least of the series. I was very disappointed.He appears to borrow from James Patterson in giving us a serialkiller and pages and pages of the killers voice. That is one,two it is boring. All the Flowers are dead and so is Matthew Scudder."
5,Simply amazing,"I have had this TV for about a week now and it is amazing. I have it hooked up to FIOS HD and the picture is stunning. The delivery took less than a week and they called me when they arrived at my house. THe people weren't that friendly but got me my tv with out any scratches. As for the TV the pros, great quality easy to set up. The cons are the viewing angles aren't great but it doens't take away much from the tv. I bought the tv for $1288 which is a an unbeatable price but then amazon drop the price to 1179 and they refunded the difference when i called them. Buy this TV and don't look back."
5,Amazing,"I have bad this tv for a few weeks now and it is simply amazing. My XBOX 360 looks great HD content is amazing and regular tv is not that bad. Delivery was with EGL and they where perfect. Delivery was right on time they set the tv up for me even moved my old one to another room, cleaned up the trash and it only took a few min. I did a extream amount of research before i picked this up looked at so many reviews it made my head hurt and over all i could not pass up the $500 savings over a local retail shop up. I would have to say that anyone who is thinking about getting this tv check it out at a local store if you like it, it would be a smart idea to pick it up here no questions it was a easy and fast process."
3,LED DLP Review,"The Picture when viewing HD content is very good on this set, but dissapointing when receiving a non HD signal from my cable provider. Samsung said they are aware of this issue and said the problem is with my cable provider(using an older 480I signal). I had no problem with my old Sony though. The non HD channels are a lttle blurry and out of focus.They reccomended using an S-video cable to watch standard Def channels."
5,Superb!,"More than I expected. The picture is beautiful and, of course, quite large. Received it in time for the World Series games."
3,Review of Teaching Physics with Toys,"Although this book has what seem to be some really fun and illustrative experiments, I was a bit put off with how many toys and other prepatory materials I will need to purchase. Since I home school my daughter, I will be buying things for one time use. I'm not sure how much I will actually use this book."
3,"Rides well, poor flat protection","These tires have replaced a Kenda street tire (rear) and a nobby MTB tire (front). With the old tire arrangement I had I'd ridden 400 miles with 1 flat on Chicago city streets. After 100 miles with these tires i've had 2 flats. I've kept the tires at 60 ppi which is the recommended pressure. Its probably just bad luck, but I've just purchased tire liners and thorn resistant inner tubes just in case. I'll try and provide an update to show whether this has helped or not. Yes, the old steel department store bike feels much faster with these tires; the reflective side walls have also been helpful to increase visibility in the morning early hours (fyi neither puncture 1 glass & 1 staple happened in the sidewall)."
5,PHB2 offers great flexibility,The options and info provided in this manual are great additions to expand any campaign that wants to be deeper than just a bunch of standard characters beating up a bunch of standard monsters. It allows flexibility and provides valuable guidelines to help you flesh out and enliven your campaign. I highly recommend it.
1,Save your money,Player's Handbook II is a waste of time and money.It is a disappointing mish mash of lame executions of potentially interesting concepts.
4,Love the new feats!,"Though much of this book is geared towards new players to help with character development, the new feats are very nice. In fact I bought this book just for the feats."
2,Players Handbook 2 Review,"I eagerly awaited this book to come out, thinking it to have quite a bit of new information. It does offer some new classes and some new spells and such, but over all the book to me was a dissapointment. The book goes into more variations of the original classes and spends some time on your character's background. Most of this information is available in the DMG and other books, this book simply puts them in one place. There is an NPC generator section that was somewhat useful, a good idea and section just not for me.Having been a gamer for over 20 years, I have read and owned my fair share of rules books, supplements and misc. books. This book in my opinion is not essential to any gamers collection nor does it truly provide much info that can not be gained from the core collection of books. The classes inside while nice, are not enough to warrant spending the money for the book."
3,"for a much smaller, lighter hard drive","It was a lot smaller then I expected, in fact my lacie hard drive could barely fit inside. Also, it was quite flimsy and didn't offer as much protection as I would have hoped.I ended up exchanging it for the larger size and found it had all the features the medium sized model lacked."
3,"Otima, mas grande","Atende muito bem para o que se destima, proteger o hd e transporte. O unico comentario que faco contra eh que eh muito grande."
4,Good case,"I bought this case for my Iomega 500 GB hard drive (34270). It fits my hard drive, the stand, usb cable, and ac adapter in the main compartment. I also have space for my ipod cable and ac adapter and a compact flash card reader in the other smaller compartment. Works great. It's does not have a lot of extra padding, but if you don't plan on throwing it around on pavement or something like that, you should be fine."
3,Fantasy,Will enjoy wearing this to keep my head warm and stylish. Can use a broach for bling. Price was right. Would buy again.
5,Fits most doesn't fit all,We purchased two of these hats...the first hat was too small for my husband so I got it. I then ordered another XL. Quality is good and we have matching hats now. We liked the product well enough to purchase two. So do we need to say any more?
5,Perfect Hat for the Project,"Building a ""Fire Mario"" costume became a lot easier when I found this hat. Standard baseball caps don't have the right shape - this one does. It's comfortable, fits snugly (perhaps a tiny bit TOO snug for me, but I have a large head, so I fully expected this), and best of all, it's got the perfect shape for the look I'm going for. A little bit of creativity on my part (still need to attach my 'M'), and it'll be all set!A definite recommendation for finishing off your favorite video game plumber costume..."
4,Pleased,This is the perfect Louisiana cap. With so much humidity you can pull all of your hair up in it and still look stylish. Being made of cotton it isn't hot. I love it and I have received lots of compliments.
1,my first digital camera,"I recently purchased the mustek dv4000 and I hate it, the pictures are awful! I used the highest quality setting and got very poor results, the only thing I do like about the camera which is why it even got one star was the fact that the digital recording I took came out OK, but digital still pics are awful and I'd advise folks to look elsewhere and not spend their money on this one. I'm sending mine back! I'm new to digital photography but I know on the highest quality setting, the photo quality shouldn't be grainy. High quality settings yielded low quality pics on mine....Anyone out there have a better experience? Could I be doing something wrong?"
3,"it does the job, not perfect","These are holding up very well. The only things I dont like are that they come with some thin rubber straps to hold things in place and those are nearly worthless. Secondly, the U-bolt that holds the racks to your frame can get loose and allow then to rotate on a round bar. You have to get them tight. I am thinking of removing them and wrapping some electrical tape where they are mounted to give them a little more bite. The rubber racks themselves are fantastic."
1,TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK (and ugly as sin!),"I took a chance on this kitchen set for my daughter's dollhouse, simply because the price was right. I was happy with the other Melissa & Doug products we had received for the dollhouse, so I figured this kitchen would do the trick. Boy was I wrong. To begin with, when I opened the box I expected to see cute black and white/ivory checkered style pieces. Instead they are GREEN and YELLOW. Not only is this just about the ugliest kitchen I have ever seen, but the refrigerator was broken into 4 pieces when I took the items out of the box. I thought it might require some sort of assembly, but after looking at it closely I realized it was simply a piece of junk that had cracked and come apart.Needless to say I am on hold with Amazon, waiting for them to process this return. My advice to you? Save your time and splurge for a more expensive kitchen set. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. Melissa and Doug definitely missed the boat on this one."
3,"Again, almost too much furnitire","The only complaint I have is similar to the living room furniture. My daughter loves to play with all of it, but it's too much to fit into the kitchen of the dollhouse. And I ordered that particular kind cause it was recommended on the page."
5,It's worth the money you spend.,"First of all, I love the hutch and the table set. The chairs are well made and the tiles on the table look real. The hutch is nice and simple, but it doesn't made it less gorgeous. The stove has a removable rack. The fridge is pretty nice, but it's sort of hard to tell it's a refrigerator. Since it's painted, it looks more like an aimoire. It's doors can be a little loose like other reviewers noticed. I am still happy with the set."
2,Very fragile...arrived broken,"The set is cute, but refrigerator door was broken on arrival and not repairable. The table top and hutch had come apart and required regluing. This set will not stand up to play."
2,Poorly Made,"I purchased this kitchen for my daughter's dollhouse. When it arrived, the kitchen table had come apart at almost every joint. I won't say it was ""broken,"" since the pieces weren't physically broken. However, I had to reglue every joint to hold it together. It is a nice looking set, but I'm waiting to see if other parts fail. Buy this at your own risk."
1,Too costly for the price,It came apart the third day and my children did not like it as it was so tiny.Too costly for the price that I paid
1,Delivered by Santa at 7 AM. Fell apart by 9 AM.,The glue used to put this set together is worse than Elmer's glue. The toy didn't even make it through Christmas morning before one of the drawer fronts detached from the drawer. We own several Melissa & Doug products and the quality tends to be pretty uneven; some products are great and others are shoddily made. This definitely falls way at the bottom end of the spectrum.
2,Not pleased,"Bought this kitchen for my dollhouse and when I received it was broken. I've bought other Melissa and Doug products and for some reason this one is not made as sturdy as the other furniture. Luckily I bought this just for show, and no one touches it. I was very pleased that they replaced it at no extra charge. And their customer service was excellent."
4,Great Set!,"This is the first non-stick bakeware I've ever had that really was non-stick! Cooking times are different with non-stick bakeware, so there's a learning curve, but cleanup is a breeze. The dark finish tends to cook the outside edges of cakes, brownies, etc. significantly faster than the center. This is a problem with darker batters, such as chocolate and molasses. I'll go back to my old pans for them, and use these new ones for yellow cake, lemon, etc.. Muffins/cupcakes of whatever color turn out great!"
1,cloying and obnoxious,"Though I am a big fan of Momus, who writes some of Kahimi Karie's songs, I can't his fetishization of Asian women, which rears its ugly head in this album. Kahimi Karie manages to set to progress back by 50 years with her I'm-just-a-cute-wimpy-Japanese-doll schtick. She may say it's just an ironic, pose, but it's a pose she's using to lure in people fascinated by the stereotype of the submissive Asian female.Despite the terrible message this anti-femenist music is sending, I might have enjoyed the music. Except the music is terrible. You're better off buying stuff by Momus or Cornelius."
2,"an Ok book, but it might be a bit too basic","If you already know some really basic photo editing, this book is not for you"
2,Only for beginners,"I can't say that this book helped me that much. The only reason I would give it a 3 is because the price, but part of the book was binded incorrectly. I mean honestly...who binds a book with an entire section upside down and backwards. I say save your money for a better book if you understand the difference between high and low resolution images. If you don't look it up...it will save you the money."
5,must check out the soundtrack...,"i haven't actually seen this documentary yet (i've heard it is great), but i highly recommend listening to the soundtrack over at your local independent record store. some of the musicians include members of Tortoise, Gastr Del Sol, Palace, Vandermark 5, 11th Dream Day, NRG and Pinetop 7. there are a few reviews also here at amazon and definatly check out their webpage at Atavistic."
1,Absolute crap,"After listening to the first 3 tracks of this album, I then proceeded to take off my shoe and hurl it at the cd player, costing me $200 in repair. I can honestly say this is the worst music I have ever listened to in my entire life. My 3 year old brother could make better music than this. The expression of stupidity and lack of maturity was amazingly shocking. As another customer said, my life was also changed in uncompromisable ways. Another reviewer said he added the day he heard Flossie to his ""most important days"" list. I, however, added Flossie and the freaking Unicorns to my hate list.Insane, purely insane. I would NEVER purchase this album, but if you enjoy things such as child molesation and Michael Jackson, this CD is for you.Enjoy!"
5,best CD ever!,"LMNOP music is the best CD in the whole world. It's lots of fun and underwater adventure with animals and Halloween and super troopers. It's perfect music for dancing or for being with friends or doing your homework to or washing the dishes. It's also really good music to listen to while eating cereal. Try it! I really like ""Flossie and the Unicorns"" cause they're a good band who make fun music. I wish people wouldn't say Flossie and the Unicorns suck because then maybe that means that the people who say they suck are really the ones that suck. I wish FLossie and the Unicorns had more Cds out. I want one that is all about Purple rhinos and flying toadstools and plastic cabaret adventures. Please ""Flossie and the Unicorns"" make your next CD about that, kay?? PLease, Please, Please please please! maybe all the people that don't like this CD are nothing but a bunch of doody-heads so don't listen to them kay?"
5,The Bridge of Country and Rock,"Confession: I grew up on rock and roll, and I love it still, but much of it is boring and predictable. I often find a better ""story"" in the lyrics of folk and country music. Most reliably, I find the best musicality and lyrics in alt-country; you preserve a lot of the energy of rock, yet you get the nuance of acoustic instruments and lyrics that are both thoughtful and intelligible. Well, Robbie Fulks really fulfills on all of these levels. He's like Lucinda Williams (a natural partner) in that aspect; I hear a lot of Joe Ely in there too and a bit of Lyle Lovett. Fulks is more raw and more edgy than any of them, and it works most of the time.Make no mistake -- this is a GREAT album. I listen to a lot of music, and Fulks is one of my finest discoveries in years; I wonder how he flew under my radar for so long. He should be a staple on college radio stations."
4,something big,"this is a good album--funny, thoughful, angry, poetic. if anything important's going to happen to inspire people maybe artists like robbie fulks will be the ones who do the inspiring. in a tepid, mundane homogenized world, this guy's got a lot of edges and a lot of things to say. ill be there for the next one, for sure."
3,Wouldn't call it a Novel,"This book comes highly recommended by favorite authors. Unfortunatly, I can't say the same. I wouldn't call it a novel, more like a short story. At only 172 pages, I was disappointed by it's size after paying what I thought was a fair price. But not only is the book skinny, the story is thin as well. While the premise is original and it includes the loved standbys of fast-paced action and adventure, it lacks substance to make it memorable. More like a 90 minute movie you forget as soon as you walk out of the theater. And like a movie, this book was clearly written with the intent of heading in that direction. Which felt like kind of a cheat to me. So skip paying the high price and just wait for the film, it's cheaper."
4,Face-paced Excitement!,"Golem is a great book! Readers will easily visualize the face-paced story. Exciting and suspenseful, it is quick to capture your attention. Golem even has some hidden ""secrets"".Very challengIng! Look for a movie of the booK soon (hopefully)!Can't wait fOr more froM this author!"
4,Great Research book!!!!,"I heard Dr. Kimbrough speak at a conference that I attended at Rust College, Holy Springs Mississippi. He was AWESOME and sooooo DYNAMIC, I had to purchase his book. I loved it! I am greek myself, and it was definitely a great research tool for those looking at greek letter organizations. It breaks down our foundations and eliminates stereotypes of sorts that may plague the minds of those that are not in historically black greek letter fraternities and sororities."
1,Cross border shopping and poor quality,"Buyer beware. I decided to purchase these blinds (3) from Sportsmans Guide because of the price and inexperience. I rerouted thru Nevada ( A relative ) and shipped to Canada to avoid extra charges shipping direct from Sportsmans Guide would have incurred. These tents have a QC problem and can't be set up as is. 1/2 the rings for the tie downs are missing and not sewn on.I have them with a seamstress now to repair them. Typical poor Chinese QC and thats why the Sportsman Guide bragged about the good deal they got and were passing on to the public. Do yourself a favor and buy a Gametracker Carbon Cabin. A true Pop Up blind and more expensive, so what. Try fighting with one of these blinds (teepee) after dark trying to fold spring steel and get it in it's pack in the dark, good luck.It's unavailable now because they were garbage!"
4,Very nice; great value,"Solid construction and all the basics. Easy set up for the most part (I had trouble only with setting up the safety stop). The optics are fine for home use, and it's easy to use. The small set of prepared slides was a very nice surprise.Only two things would make it a little more user-friendly: coarse and fine focus adjustments on the same dial (similar to the stage adjustment), and a switch on the light source.Overall I would definitely recommend this for the hobbyist; it's a great value for the price."
2,Nothing Special,"I was disappointed with this book. It is just the same things in the other books about Bobby warmed over. You don't learn anything new. The best book I read on Bobby was Roman Candle, The Life of Bobby Darin and Dream Lovers, but especially the Roman Candle book. If you want to find out everything about Bobby (the good things) read the Roman Candke book. This book is waste of time."
3,"'Bobby Darin: A Life', a review","My knowledge of Bobby Darin was limited to childhood memories and the 2004 Kevin Spacey movie. I was happy to find that my memory and the movie were basically accurate. The story of his life, both personally and professionally, was as enjoyable, interesting and breezy as Darin's music. It was sad to realize he died so young."
5,LoveMaster is unique and extremely funny!!!,"I havew personally seen the ""Lovemaster"" live at a local comedy club in L.A. He is truely talented and I would compare him to the caliber of Jerry Lewis of old. You won't go wrong with this DVD. Plenty of laughs."
5,Wonderfully Warm Mocassins!,My mother-in-law really enjoys these slippers.... I will probably be buying these again when she wears out the ones I recently got her. They are hard to beat in warmth and comfort. Well worth the price.
4,Very pleased,My daughter was very pleased with the gift and loved the shoes. They are very comfortable.
4,Just what she wanted for Christmas!,Gave these to our daughter for Christmas. They were just what she wanted. Just what she asked for. Yeah us!
2,Not worth the price.,These slippers were not worth the price. I've Been wearing them now for 2 months and they are already starting to fall apart. I'll never buy anything like this online again. Much better to go to a shoe store so you can see the quality before purchasing.
4,NOT for women with larger boobs!,"I just received my Marmot Montreaux coat and was super excited as I have never owned a Marmot before, but have heard fabulous things. I am 5'7"" woman with a larger build and large breasts. Reading reviews on the internet about the coat running small, I ordered the XL (would normally wear a L). The coat is super soft, warm and wonderful, but unfortunately, despite ordering up a size is very snug in the chest. I don't think I could even fit a light weight sweater underneath. Because the sleeves and length were a bit long due to ordering up, I am not going to order the XXL....SAD :-("
2,Disappointed,Great colour but too bulky in padding .I have another Marmot all weather coat in large and fits perfectly and well finished .I returned the Monteaux coat as the cut was too narrow under the arms and an unflattering cut.The coats were made in different countries which may account for this.
4,"Feels warm, but the shell seems not durable enough.","Bought a SMALL, which fits my wife very well (5'7'', 110 pound), can even cover her knees. The coat feels good, soft, warm and light weight, but my only concern is that the material of the shell seems very thin, I hope it can last a longer time than it looks. Anyway, it's a good option for girls who fears of cold in winter, my wife and me like it very much."
3,SORROW,.... BECAUSE IT WAS & IS USED . HOWEVER IT WORKS . I LIKE THAT TRACK . 1 OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG OF DISCO MUSIC
5,Don't Stop Movin' DVD Single,"The DVD is quite good in my perspective, and has excellent quality. I give it 5 stars."
3,Small But Cute,"It is a beautiful watch, but I wish there had been a way to discern the size. When I took it out of the box, I thought how cute. But when I put it on and tried to see the time the numbers were too small for my eyes. If you have fairly good eyesight you will have no problems. The chain could have been a little longer but another chain can be used.I would more than likely recommend it to friends."
5,WONDERFUL!,"What a wonderful CD. We already have ""For the Kids, Too!"" and love it. These CDs are fun and geat even for parents. It is not full of sappy, baby-ish music. A definite must-have!"
1,B is for Bad,"This album has the potential to be good with a conglomeration of artists. However, it is not. It is horribly boring. There are many other children's music albums out there that are so much better. Save your money and buy Susie Tallman or Lori Berkner."
3,Great music but a bit slowly paced for kids,"No surprise that these tunes, although for kids, have all the style and artistry of any contemporary music. However, I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more uptempo selections in the mix .... after a few listenings I would say about a third of the songs are of the lullaby or ballad persuasion, and a few more seem neither fast nor slow. So if you have kids that like to jump around the room and dance when they listen to their music, or simply request ""I want fast music,"" this may not be for your family. Check out Trout Fishing in America, or even my 3-year old's current favorite, the Beach Boys."
2,3 or 4 good songs,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time!"
5,Living Room Yoga,"5 Stars all the way! I've purchased many yoga DVD's over the years, but this is the only one that truly got me to continuing practicing yoga. Eva is cute and an excellent instructor. I've been doing her 40 minute workout for 4 months now and I'm in better shape than ever! It's fun and challenging at same time. Give it a few tries and you will be hooked. The price can't be beat. Thank you Eva!!!"
5,THE US NAVY DID IT,THE UNITED STATES NAVY DID IN FACT SHOOT DOWN TWA FLIGHT 800 AND FIRED 2 MISSILES OR MORE BY NAVY SHIP THEN FLEED THE SCENE AT 30 KNOTS AND RADAR CAPTURED IT AND THAT SHIP WAS NEVER FOUND AND NAVY DID IT THATS A FACT
3,the Virginian,"The seller of this was great. However, the movie isn't how we remembered it. The stories are long and drawn out."
1,Zero for Two with Actiontec,"Of the two Actiontec DSL modems I've purchased, each has failed after about one year of service. They work fine when they work, but they don't seem to work for very long."
3,Pretty Good Purchase,"I remembered Lotsa Luck growing up & always admired Dom Deluise. The set is pretty good, I had a few problems with the initial set skipping, so I returned it & the 2nd set is much better. The original pilot is kind of jumpy & grainy, but otherwise it was a PRETTY GOOD PURCHASE."
2,Dissapointed,"The Scorpions are (were?) a good rock band. Their live performances were characteristic of the band, particularly in the eighties. This DVD attempts to capture early nineties performances but it is unsuccessful. Scorpions used to have a lot of interaction with the audience, had awesome encores and were energetic. Neither of these characteristics is shown in the DVD. They seemed bored. In addition, the edition breaks between song and song making the video a show of isolated boring songs. The bottom line: the concert section smells too bad.The videos section is OK, it would have been nice if they had included more classics. That's why I give them two stars."
3,not ofr little ones,"I thought my grandchildren will have ton of fun with this one... but they lost interest on this one fairly quickly. While they giggle when they fall, it was hard getting them interested on playing the game. (Ages4&3)"
4,A must-have reference book,Hirsch has done a great service for the public at large by compiling this reference work. Although the entries are intentionally very concise it lists for the reader all the basics and pointers needed to be literate in today's day and age. It masterfully avoids being superfluous. Supplements for specialized fields in this format would also be very useful to extend the core knowledge.
5,Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,The book was in excellent condition and it arrived rapidly. Very pleased. Thanks for the great service.
2,Not literate yet.,"This book is no Hooked on Phonics for the Soul. It was not the enculturation to supplement my acculturation. Some parts are better than others. blues, Blue-Tail Fly, and bohemian start p. 170. The middle one is interesting to learn about: a slave song, its refrain I had heard, ""Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care; My master's gone away."" The other two words are briskly defined with no attempts at etymology.It could be useful only if you want very superficial information about history, health, and society. For people with real curiosity: Google, Wikipedia, or actual library visits will satisfy better."
5,Excellent Resource for a quick refresher,I found this book to be the perfect refresher of all those terms you learned back in high-school and university but can't remember everything about. Highly recommend!
2,Fun design - poor durability,"This is a fun bell (visually and soundwise) - only problem is its durability. I've had internal gears/mechanism on two of these fail after a half a year of use. I recommend taking a look at a bell with a simpler mechanism (the Mirrycle Incredibell Original Bicycle Bell, or Mirrycle Brass Duet Incredibell Bicycle Bell)."
1,Tasted terrible. Threw it out.,"I bought this because it used evaporated cane juice, which I use often to bake desserts. Even though I've had several vegan products in past, and ones which I loved, I thought this tasted terrible! The 2 kids I baked it for, who love the vegan desserts I've given them, also thought it was terrible. I'm confused as to how the previous 3 reviewers could have possibly given this product 5 stars. The cookies weren't even so-so. I threw them all away!"
1,why doesnt it work?,"I wish i could say that my copy worked but after buying from best buy and having 3 copies of this DVD not work it gets frustrating. This is a great series otherwise, its just really unfortunate that this volume doesnt play at all..."
4,Fun Quilt,I made the cover quilt top. I love it. The instructions were easy and well written. I will be making more of the quilts from the book they are just as adorable.
4,A Compilation of Exquisite Tunes,"Somewhere between trip-hop, jungle and soul, the first, self-titled record of Spool brings to us breathtaking, involving and emotional sounscapes. Melodies are relaxed, but never boring; dark, but never disturbing. This exquisite album deserves to be one of the best of 1998. The best track is the first one, ""Ebo"", which contains almost fifteen minutes of misterious music that will make you feel that those minutes were not enough. Highly recommended for fans of trip-hop (specially, groups like Alpha), and electronica."
5,See changes right away.,"I have really bad stretch marks all over from my pregnancy. It has been 3 years and it just doesn't go away. I tried those other creams, and didn't see any differences. After using this cream, I noticed my stretch marks fade and look lighter. I still have stretch marks, but it looks better than before. Don't expect a miracle, because the stretch marks are not going to dissappear. I heard even Laser couldn't take away all the stretch marks. I gotta admit it smells bad though. I only use it once a day and has finished the 6 oz tube, now I'm buying another one. It is expensive, but well worth the money. Those other creams like Vita-K and Coco Butter doesn't help at all, they are cheaper in prices."
1,Not Impressed,"I purchased a 6oz tube from Amazon back in December. I started using using Strivectin on Dec. 6th. I have not seen any difference in my forehead wrinkles or around my eyes. As a matter of fact I think I'm starting to develope a new forehead wrinkle. So, it doesn't prevent wrinkles from developing, either. After reading all the reviews, I have to wonder if I received a counterfiet tube of Strivectin. Whatever I got, it doesn't work and I won't be purchasing any other miracle products. I guess I'll just age naturally..."
4,Working well on acne scars,"I'm almost 40 and blessed with great skin with no lines whatsoever. However, I have a few reddish discolorations/scars from acne. I tried Strivectin-SD on a whim from Costco Canada because of the excellent reviews I saw online and Costco's great return policy. To my surprise, I started seeing a difference with the red blotches almost immediately. I'm only week 2 into my strivectin experiment, so I don't know if the blotches will go away completely. They are definitely showing signs of improvement as far. I don't know what people are talking about in terms of its color and smell. My cream is white and it has no particular smell at all. Maybe it's because I bought it in Canada and it's a different formulation? Not sure. As for the cost, I paid $139 for 2 giant tubes that will probably last me 7 months or so. I don't find $20 a month that horrendous for a good moisturizer, which this is, at the very least."
1,After 6 weeks on one side of my face ...,"I'm 46 and have pretty good skin. I was very excited about Strivectin and started using it religiously. I could have sworn that it was making my skin look better. It was one of the first cosmetic product I ever bought. After several months I became cynical about the entire industry after seeing marketing claims for various products that were obviously bogus. So I decided to really test Strivectin by only putting in on one side of my face. The skin regenerates every 28 days, but I kept doing it for 6 weeks.No results whatsoever! I asked several friends which side of my face looked better and most of my friends would say there was no difference. A few chose a side, but they were evenly divided between both sides."
2,Very disappointed,"After all the hype I expected at least some results, but found that after 30 days there was no improvement in lines and wrinkles, and in fact my previous product didn't make my pores as noticeable. I will not continue using Strivectin-SD."
4,butcher block table,the table is a fine looking piece very good looking and sturdy table I most definitly would buy another one
1,A disappointment,The book reads like an afterthought rather than a culmination to an interesting trilogy. The plot seems more designed to finish the series than to build to a satisfactory climax and the last chapters bring in a deus ex machina that makes little sense. One gets the impression that Macleod became tired of the series.
1,"Incoherent, confused, disappointing","Trilogies are hard. The most common pattern is a good start, a good to weak middle, and a weak ending. Macleod doesn't do that well.The first book of this trilogy was an improvement on his previous writing, putting him almost at the same level at the earlier (weaker) books of Iain M Banks. By the second book he's slipped into the middle tier of writers, the third book sometimes reads like a satire of the first two. He seems desperate to find a way out of the story and finally just gives up.Macleod shows signs of promise. He needs an editor, more discipline, and more practice. Stay away from the trilogies for a while.As for you readers -- skip this book and skip the series."
5,Jimi's Book of Japanese Sequel: As Fantastic as the First,"Jimi's Book of Japanese: A Motivating Method to Learn Japanese (Katakana) (Jimi's Book of Japanese)After hearing inumerable Japanese phrases and other assorted Asian utterances--most likely from the hours my 9-year old niece spends watching Samurai Jack and Avatar--I bought her two books in the Jimi's Book of Japanese series in an attempt to at least encourage her to further her foreign language efforts in a meaningful way.These books are great. After a brief period of time she's mastered both basic syllable sets of modern Japanese. I am happy to say I would recommend both books to anyone who is looking to motivate their kids/relatives to expand their intellectual horizons.JIMI'S BOOK OF JAPANESE: A Motivating Method to Learn Japanese (Katakana) by Peter X. Takahashi, illus. by Yumie Toka, (Takahashi & Black, ISBN 0972324720 16.95, 76pp.)See alsoJimi's Book of Japanese: A Motivating Method to Learn Japanese (Hiragana)"
4,"RIGHT SIZE, BUT NEEDS A STRAP","I purchased this laundry bag for a graduation gift, and was hoping the USN logo was going to be printed on the bag, since the graduate's father was in the navy for several years. It came plain. The size was perfect and the quality was very good. I had the bag embroidered at a local shop with the USN logo and the last name of the grad. If the bag had a long canvas handle from top to bottom, it would have been perfect. Grabbing a heavy bag full of laundry with just the string/rope handle is hard on the fingers."
5,Great!!,I thought this book was fantastic. I grew to love the characters and was only disappointed that it had to come to an end. I'll probably be thinking of them for a long while. Andrew Winston did a nice job organizing the chapters. It all flowed together beautifully.
1,Terrible!,"Don't wast your time or money. I used this book specifically for Proxy Server and, although I passed, judging from the exam questions I can see now that the information within was extemely lacking. At best, this book would be usefull for last minute review, but not for a study guide. One more thing, although no study reads like a novel, some effort should be made to limit all the 6 to 8 word sentences!"
2,Just an overview,"This book basically gives you an overview of what IIS, Proxy and IEAK do. Do not expect to learn too much from this book since it's basically a study guide. It is just a series of quick explanations and exercises trying to explain/describe what several pieces of software do.If you need to pass the exam, experience, the online docs and technet is what will count here, as there are many issues addressed in the test that are not even touched by this book."
2,"A good overview, lots of errors.","The book is a easy read but that is also it's downfall. There are many errors that would cause missed questions on the exam. Some errors are simple mistakes such as giving info on IIS 3.0 not IIS 4.0. Other errors are very misleading and will cause problems for exam takers that do not own other information sources. It does not cover simulation testing and index server enough, but does contain some good reference material."
1,Ripcord,I have had this Vacuum Decanter for several weeks and it is impossible to release the bottle after it is cacuumed down to the area as instructed. It took myself and a friend pver 30 minutes to release the vacuum in the decanter to get the wine out.I'm 72 years old but my friend is many years younger and much stronger. If I had not called him the wine would still be im the bottle. I wont go into everything we tried and I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,A gimmick,"The whole point of having a decanter is to aerate the wine, not to preserve it in a vacuum. Since not all wines need decanting, but all of them could use a vacuum stopper to preserve any unfinished wine, it makes much more sense to just get a regular decanter and some vacuum stoppers (Metrokane or Houdini stoppers are fine) instead of this vacuum decanter."
1,lack of instructions,"I found it very awkward trying to stabilize the pump with one hand, and pull the pump up and down to get the air out.Also I can not get the top out of the decanter. It seems stuck there.As a result, I can not say if it does what you claim."
4,Wine Preservation,"This artifact works perfectly to keep the wine drinkable 1, 2, 3 days after opening the bottle. The only downside is that the valve can ultimately fail, rendering the object unworkable. Should the purveyor of this item offer some kind of a valve guarantee, I can think of no better product for the wine drinker who wishes to preserve some wine after the first day."
5,Great Book,"I enjoyed this book very much -- it wasn't a typical Christian formula story by a Christian author. The book showed the life struggles of several seemingly real characters -- and how none of their lives are what they had imagined them to be 20 years earlier. It reminded me of a Christian version of the movie ""The Big Chill."" I am anxious to read more by this author."
4,Perfect Love Songs,This album is great. I believe that most of his best work is captured on here. This is a definate buy!
3,Nice but nothing special,"I bought four of these to store sweaters in my closet. Although there are fine, they are not as nice as I had hoped for the price. I have no complaints about the product listing--this is just one of those things you need to see to decide if it is right. They are fairly sturdy, but they also give you splinters very easily. Handle with care!"
3,Not bad for a 50 year old.,"This is not a bad recording. I have had it about a year, and altho it is Bobby Now, it still doesn't sound that bad. What is it going to take to get Abkco off their duff and re-release the Parkway and Cameo label material. This stuff would sell. Critics Choice thought it would be out last year but still nothing appears anywhere, except the imports and this K-Tel remake. Maybe someday."
3,"too much shoe, not enough support","I was looking for a very supportive walking shoe. I thought this one also looked funky/stylish. Based on other reviewers comments I ordered a pair. The fit was all right size wise but the shoe was stretchy on the top surface making it not supportive enough for what I was in the market for. I didn't think it lived up to the billing of being a comfort shoe either because of the roominess in the shoe I would have needed a thick sock to go walking in it anywhere, even around home. The style was more otrhopedic than funky. A good shoe perhaps, but not for me. I returned it."
4,Very good reference book,"This book is always good to pick up, get excited about indoor plants. It was wonderful when I lived in an apartment."
4,Intriguing,"The sketches, while hilarious, are enlightening. This is an easy to read manual and I shall refer to it often."
4,very good read,"informative book, i liked it ,very useful, i like Dr. Oz he is very down to earth and gives lotsof easy to follow advice ..."
5,"Good, Fun Health","I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to others interested in prolonging their lives and avoiding disease. I'm purchasing copies for my non-medical family members as holiday gifts this year (we have 2 M.D.s in the family). The book promises and delivers meaningful health facts and long-life advice for everyone, from head to toe, in a fun and easy to understand format. The drawings are comical and yet meaningfully illustrate the internal designs of our bodies. The advice about prolonging life and avoiding disease is current and helpful.Overall, the book was educational and informative, imparting important medical info in an entertaining and easy-to-understand lay-person format."
3,Some great information but lousy illustrations,"This is a great book if you know nothing at all about the human body. You'll pick up some great information and tips on what foods to eat and exercises to do in order to treat your body well. The only gripe I have about this book is the illustrations. They're drawn well, but the authors decided to rename a lot of the parts of the body in the pictures for comedic effect. The result is, you don't know what the parts are actually called. It would be embarrassing if you didn't know any better, and were using the words in the drawings when talking to others about the body. It would have been much better to leave the comedy to the writing and the comics, or at least put the real names of the parts on there along with the funny ones so people could know the proper names. Overall, this was great book, as long as you keep in mind that many of the drawings aren't labeled correctly."
4,This is what I need,I am in diet for a few months so this book guides me to know more info about my body. Thanx for the writers
5,You. . A tremendous book.,I find that much more compelling than just being asked to follow the instructions. The book also guides us on how to take care of our internal organs.
1,How about an original idea?,"The author's have written this book in language geared toward 5th graders. There is not one orignal idea in the book. Money is better spent on many other well-written health books for the general public that are already on the market such as Prescription for Natural Cures by Balch or The American Epidemic: Obesity, Diabetes,Metabolic Syndrome - What's Your Risk? Prescription for Prevention by Biuso"
1,YOU call this a book for literate adults?,"Any purported ""health"" book that in the 21st century writes ""Because they can't imagine having sex without an orgasm, many men can't appreciate the fact that women can enjoy sex without having one."" and then goes on to say that men should concentrate on ""women enjoying the interaction"" should be ashamed of itself. Women have fought long and hard for the equal right to an orgasm and these two MEN have just diminished that right.Furthermore, I find the level of writing to be juvenile at best and might be most fitting in a high school health class. No, I take that back, the initial comments should not fall in the hands of ANY man - young or old.The book is insulting!"
1,Who Needs Owner's Manuals?,"Listen to your friends, parents and cousins tips! You don't need this manual! Save your money to buy vegetables!"
5,If you think you know....you don't!,"This book is totally phenomenal. Its approach is unique. These extraordinary physicians EMPOWER you to pay attention, understand and make choices. The text .... believe it or not... incorporates humor at times. But the primary focus is information in an understandable, conscience raising form to be your own best advocate and truly understand our remarkable bodies. I want to buy this book for everyone I care about!"
2,Not bad,"This book is ok but far away to reveal the truth about the Diet and the bad impac on the body. I really like the new book by Jean Carrillo title ""What's NEXT?"" I learn so much with this book, and stop to lose my money on Diets, Miracles Products etc... A must to Have for the one who really want Burn Fat, Lose Weight and change the life style"
3,"Good On The Colon, but still based in fear.","Amazon's review of this book does the colon justice, but these doctors are still coming from a fear-based perspective on health, and NOT coming fro a holistic perspective. The body is more than a body. This book is over-rated. At least it's better than Troudeau's. But not as good as Gangi's."
4,Very informative,"I really liked this book except for one thing. Whenever they talked about how incredible the human body is they would praise evolution for providing it to us. It is just too ludicrous. When I ignore those references, the book was very enjoyable to read. It was very easy to read and understand. I don't think the authors ""dumbed us down"" like another reviewer said. If you want to live healthier then this book will show you how."
3,EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS.....,"Everyone should own this book or buy it for those they love, I am a massage therapist and it really helped me in my practice who knew people have gas and release it 14x a day or more. This book is a must have."
4,Another wonderful saga!,"The first Sweet Valley Saga focused on Elizabeth and Jessica's maternal ancestors, descended from Alice Larson (who could have ended up with Wakefield if not for a cruel twist of fate), but this one focuses on the twin's father's ancestors. here, we see the first Wakefield and his encounter with Alice Larson, and what happens after he and Alice are parted from one another.His story is distinctly different from Alice and the other sagas, so this book remains interesting and isn't a mere rehash of previous volumes. I have to admit, I rather liked the Saga series more than most of the other Sweet Valley books I ever read."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I spotted this pattern by chance while doing some after Christmas bargain shopping at a higher end department store. I fell in love with it and had to have it but I wasn't willing to pay the high ""on sale"" price the Dept. store was asking.I came home and my internet search ""was on"" to try to find it for less $$. I purchased 2 sets of this china and 8 matching soup bowls from Amazon.com at a great bargain, (the cheapest by far that I could find anywhere on line or in stores)This will be a beautiful set to use for holidays for many years to come and a wonderful set to pass down to my children. It will also be nice to add to it over time as there are many accessories to choose from!Amazon free shipping was lightning fast and they carefully packaged all of the china."
2,Break easily with young children,"We loved the look and feel of the furniture, however it broke quite easily (my daughter was 3 at the time of receiving this as a gift). The dollhouse as well as been busted up pretty easily too. The biggest problem with the furniture is that the little legs have broken off. If you can find them, that's the first feat! I would find the broken legs and then I tried gluing them back on the main pieces, but they never really held. (Maybe I didn't have the right type of wood glue, perhaps). Also, the bed foam/mattress has been pulled off and that too never quite went back on properly. The bottom line is: Not a good toy for children under 5, maybe even older if your kids are tough on toys."
3,How long should it take to inflate a pontoon boat?,"Maybe my expectations are too high. My 9 ft pontoon boat doesn't that much air, so I figured one to two minutes per side. After more then five minutes I thought maybe something was wrong. The unit seems to put out a good volume of air, but it seems to only pump to about 70% of the capacity needed to get firm but not too firm pontoons. My little one gallon compressor can fill each side in about 45 seconds. Is the Kwik Tek unit just not up to the job?"
4,Napoleon,A DVD on the history of the Great man and his abilities to help him achieve greatness. I recommend to anyone who has an interest in the man.
5,The Spiritual Soldier's Rule Book,"This book is a must read for all serious Christians who do or even do not recognize that we are engaged in spiritual warfare everyday of our lives. The reality is we are the enemy of Satan who is seeking to steal, kill, and destroy us by any means necessary.So, this is the first book I have read that lays it all out in easy to read and comprehendable terms for even the most novice Christian. Scriptual references, humorous real life examples, and practical tools are what makes this book a must have in every Christian arsenal."
4,"Much cheaper than a bespoke waterproof case, with some tradeoffs","Custom-built waterproof card cases cost as much if not more than the camera itself. Waterproof/shock proof cameras aren't cheap either. This case seemed like a good tradeoff of cost vs. function when I wanted to be able to take pictures while on a tubing trip. I used this with my Canon SD1000, which is relatively small camera. The pleated bag gave plenty of room for the lens to extend, but it did take some adjustment and folding over of the case to get it to conform around the camera in order to take a picture. The waterproofness of the case is absolutely as advertised. I wore it around my neck and had no problems with leakage despite splashing and swimming around quite a bit. Great way to turn your regular camera into a waterproof camera for just a few bucks."
3,Tiny print,"This book has the smallest print of any book I own. Plus the font is sans serif. Very difficult to read. I'm not sure if I like this book or not--I can hardly see it. And yes, I'm wearing my glasses."
1,Product does not function as a wallet,"The description leads one to believe that the case has a card slot, similar to what you'd expect with a wallet type case; however, there is not a card slot available.In addition, the part of the case which flips up gets in the way when holding the phone sideways and the case does not fit the 8x device well."
5,DIM,"The product is reputed to help control estrogen levels, and that's why I bought it. It is a safe supplement from many vegetables."
2,NOT a miracle in the bottle,"After reading all of these raving feedbacks on this product (and because most of those women had same symptoms that I have), I decided to give it a try. I've been taking it daily for three months now, and suddenly right after I started taking DIM, also started experiencing cramps and pain in my lower abdomen between my periods, my lower back, aches in my limbs and overall lack of energy. When my period actually came (about 1 week after I started taking DIM), it was much worse and more painful than it was before. I talked to my doctor and she said, that it might take some time for the product to start working and make any positive changes. I did want to stop taking it, that's how bad my cramps were, but because she told me to give it a longer try, I didn't. So it's been 3 months now, and I don't see any improvements yet - my periods are still heavy and very painful."
1,"DIM works, but not this brand","I usually buy Natures Way DIM, and it works wonders for PMS. Whenever I start feeling symptoms, I take a double dose, and I start feeling better within a couple of days. This month, I felt some hideous PMS coming on, and I was desperate for an immediate cure. The Natures Way brand wasn't eligible for Amazon Prime, so I decided to try this brand. Big mistake. I took a double dose for a full week, and my symptoms just kept getting worse. Don't waste your money."
4,Good Price and Performance,"I picked this up for about $1000 during a Micro Center After Christmas Sale.Over all it looks brilliant with an off-air HD signal and DVD. The black-levels (black colored contrast) leave quite a bit to be desired, but the reduced amount of screen lighting glare compared to most technologies is good. When the camera is panning across a scene the image seems to jutter, it may have something to do with the response time. Also, the remote needs to be replaced.One time it would not change channels, so I wrote the company by e-mail and they did not respond. I unplugged the TV and plugged it back in and it fixed the problem. Digital Channels take a while to change so instread of just flipping channels, I enter the number in. Otherwise, I am pretty impressed for the money. You probably cannot beat it."
1,Meh.,didn't like the DVDs at all. They leave off half way through the series. I do not suggest buying them.
4,Another fine moomin book.,"Tove Jansson, Moominland Midwinter (FSG, 1958)Oh, those crazy moomins! In this installment, Moomintroll wakes up halfway through the winter. It's tough to be a hibernating animal with insomnia. With no one to play with, he mopes about the house for a few days before venturing outside and finding that the world in winter is a very different place than the world in summer, and there are many new friends to be made and adventures to be had.As always, a charming book. ****"
3,Not Very Informative,I have not finished this book yet because there is too much information about older systems with very little information on calculations. It is not a very inspiring book to read.
2,A Questionable Study,Ms. Clark has written a book about her interviews with young people and their families and has tried to draw conclusions about their religious beliefs from their television-watching habits. There are so many questions raised in the reader's mind that the book can hardly be called a valid study--perhaps an extensive opinion poll would be more apt.
4,"Very good, but not outstanding","It starts out great, with a war of liberation for Earth. However, the last section of the book is a bit too lengthy. Still, it is conceptually fascinating and rich with ideas."
5,Very happy buyer,"The item was receved in good condition, the delivery was fast and the quality was very nice.I recommend this companyThanks"
4,Good to order online for us lazy folks,Not the best quality or price as you can find these really cheap (less than a buck at times) but for someone lazy like me that didn't want to run to a store and didn't mind the wait it was good.
5,Dryer vent cover,Just what I was looking for and could not find in the stores. It really helped to keep the cold air out of my room..
4,highly recommend,"The dryer vent has definitely decreased the draft coming into the laundry room and greatly decreases the opportunity for litle creatures to get in through the dryer vent. It was easily painted to match the house. The downside is the cheap plastic it is constructed with. We had one on out old house that was purchased 5-6 years ago and it was a stronger/higher quality product. The design was the same, it was just a better product, but isn't that the way most things were compared to today's products? Would still recommend this product."
3,Also sticks,"Well I have the same problem, the cylinder sticks, because it is slightly deformedAfter shaving the plastic some with a file it works great but, a buyer should nothave to modify a new product."
2,Large,"Too large if in a highly visible area,didn't use it, gave it away. Something to consider if going in a prominent location."
5,Great,"Service was great. Received prompt delivery. Item was as promised. This was a replacement for a unit I had from 8 years ago, even the mounting holes were the same! Good show!"
2,Poorly manufactured,"I bought four of these units, 2 units the cup floated nicely, 2 units the cup would not float either because it was too big or out of round. Shame on the Battic DoorCompany for lousy quality."
3,Bought this for my wife,"My wife is a tea snob (I'm a coffee snob). She says it's ""good."" That means ""It's ok"" to the rest of us. She says it's stronger than her regular ""snob"" tea so she uses a bit less. To me that sounds like a good thing. Believe ,e, if she hadn't liked it, she definitely would have said so."
4,Wonderful uplifting read,"Kingsbury handles a very difficult story line with grace, offering testimony of God's amazing love even through horrible times. The author says the story was given to her during the 911 attacks, and this book will help us all heal. Difficult to put down, this beautiful story lifts spirits out of the ashes of that dreadful day and its aftermath and into hope for times to come."
5,Awesome author!,"Perfect author for an amazing series, so that we will never forget this event that has changed so many lives. Karen writes with reality--not just ""pie in the sky"" fluff. My teenage daughter told me she doesn't want to read more Christian love stories that don't seem real, but Karen's books share how God is involved in our lives, through good and bad. Now we want to read all her books!"
2,Shipping charges are outrageous,"I buy this dental tape from an Amazon supplier because I have trouble finding it in my local pharmacy, supermarket, etc.But the shipping charges are out of line for the size of the package and its value. Three of these cost me $9 in shipping.Next time I will ask my pharmacy to order it for me."
2,Just not hot,"I do like the smell of this stuff, and use it in the gym to open up my sinuses. However, I feel no heat when using the rub. I'm also used to very strong rubs, so maybe this will work for the occasional user"
3,Now I Remember Why it Was Cancelled,"To put it bluntly, this is NOT a funny show. They tried their hardest to make it work. But the scripts were just too juvenile and.....well......just not funny. But it was good to see these people again. I remember them well.....and fondly."
4,Funny,"I had never had seen the show before now, but it's actually a pretty funny show! I would recommend it to anyone who liked the sitcoms from the 60's and 70's."
5,Really Good British Historical Drama,"This is very good, it's interesting to see things in history that we never heard about, can't wait until the next one comes out. You can't find any better period pieces than the ones the British make.I had not heard of this, but thanks to Amazon sending me emails with things they think I might like, I have discovered many new series that I have never heard of."
2,Not really a Kindle book,"This Kindle ""ebook"" is completely unlike any other Kindle ebook I have purchased before. It is a poorly done scan, presented as half-pages of images, with the text hard to read on the newest model Kindle. The text size can't be changed, photos are split between one page and the next, and not at all what I expect from a Kindle ebook.There is another Kindle title of what may be the same SEAL Physical Fitness Guide along with a nutrition manual, The U.S. Navy Seal Guide to Fitness and Nutrition. This has the normal attributes of a Kindle ebook.Based on buying many Kindle ebooks, I did not download a sample chapter first, assuming the quality would be normal. In this case, the Amazon policy of no returns on ebooks is not a good policy. I trusted the Kindle brand when I purchased it, but found my trust was misplaced."
3,Expertise in paleontology limited,The author discusses a few well known fossils in a very minimal fashion. He basically offers quotes from people representing minority views. The author's lack of experise in paleontology is sorely apparent in discussing the reptile-mammal transition. This transition is well docmented and actually shows how the mammal jaw evolved from the reptile jaw.I cannot recommend this book due to the apparent lack of expertise by the author.
2,Disappointing,"Far too wide to be called medium. Basically just two strips of leather stitched together. So, if one just likes some kind of sloppy slide to wander around the house, guess they're OK. I have narrow feet anyway, purchased these a size down to compensate, and they're still like boats, which normally is not the case with other shoes."
2,Not As Good As Others In This Series,Not up to the standards set by other books in this series. Very skimpy on details of Dylan's career and even skimpier on recording details. Most other books covering Dylan's recordings are superior.
3,Perfect Match & Cheap Quality,this item is a great match for Toyota!u just have to cut the plastic parts which your model doesnt need and thats itPlastic quality is the only point that i didnt likeCheap item for a cheap price ;)
4,Analysis of Structural Systems 1997,"This is a good book on the structural analysis of structures(both statically determinate and indeterminate) using QBASIC in the MS DOS environment.It includes software on matrix analysis of engineering structures(flexibility and stiffness methods). My regret though, is that QBASIC is no longer present in my current OS version, but I was still able download an older version of QBASIC from the internet.The book is supposed to be supplied with software(on CD-ROM) as advertised, but unfortunately the seller informed me they cannot find any one left to send to me."
4,soft case for nikon d80,"Good protection for camera but where do you put it when using camera. It doesn't attach to camera so you're left ""holding the bag"" when using camera."
4,OK for 18-135mm lens but....,"Very nice case for Nikon D80 camera and 18-135mm lens that comes with the package. Soft leather, attractive. But I also bought the longer 70-300mm lens--case won't fit. So I keep the longer lens in the bag."
3,Be clear on why you want it,"I wanted a case that would snugly fit my camera and offer enough protection so that I could throw it in my messenger bag. It doesn't fit my D80 w/18-200vr lens as snug as I'd like(but it does fit), and I'm not satisfied with the protection. I'm going to try and return this if I can and buy a Crumpler or Timbuk2 messenger bag or any other bag that can house my macbook pro and d80 and maybe a few books and notebooks. If anybody knows of a better option, please let me know!"
3,A few duds...,"I really only bought this DVD for the 2 CDs that come with it; the DVD was more or less a bonus. Most of the songs were excellent, but there were 4 songs that sounded completely out of place. Other than that, no a bad selection of tunes. As for the DVD, it's not the greatest in the world, but considering this DVD/CD set cost me only $2.22, I think I got my money's worth. It's not that the DVD is horrible, but the quality leaves a bit to be desired. That being said, I'm definitely happy I bought this."
3,left me wishing for more,"This book does not promise much, and lives up to its promise. The concept is a great one, meditations/explorations of the various ""names"" of Christ. In the end, it turns out to be more or less a concordance of all the times the various ""names"" appear in the bible, with nowhere near as much fleshing out of each one as I would have hoped. I buy a lot from this publisher (Ignatius) and I am almost always very pleased with the quality (and orthodoxy) of what they sell. This one, though, is only fair."
4,E.F. Benson's Lulu and Liblib,"There is an Elizabeth Mapp and a Lucia Lucas in all our lives. We may try to avoid them, we may even be slightlyscared of them, but we wouldn't for a moment be without them. ""Make Way for Lucia"" is a collection of relatively short stories centred around the claustrophic life of the pre-war British villages of Riseholme and Tilling. Lucia is the social queen but she is under constant threat of being toppled from her throne by the socially ambitious Miss Mapp.This most genteel warfare is set amongst tea-gardens, bridge parties and music evenings. The stories are entertaining with many ""laugh out loud"" moments, and the joy and the pleasure linger long after the final curtain.A book to be read again and again. Enjoy."
4,Short but satisfing (2 xtra vids not on VHS),"I purchased this DVD to replace the skimpy VIDEO HITS (6 vids) & I ejoyed this, w/ all those videos plus original versions of ""Bad to the Bone"", ""Nobody But Me"" & ""Night Time"" (on Video Hits stuff such as the ""Bad""'s Lucky Stike cig-pack, The drummer's Chuck Berry t-shirt in ""Nobody but Me"" & the same drummer's Michigan University jersey in ""Night Time"" appear to be blurred out, since these vids were made before free-advertising was outlawed on MTV, but on ""On Tap"" they appear intact.) The Boston blues-rocker wasn't too much of a MTV darling, (hence his clips were too raw for people hooked on synth-pop in the early '80's) but it's nice to see 'em on DVD, especially the TV-wrestling clip for ""hand Jive""."
2,Quite hard crystals not as good as others,"I got this and ""Course Gray Sea Salt"" from Brittany both from Amazon. The crystals in this salt tend to be very hard and hence are more like little stones than anything else and also do not impart as much flavor as you eat them added to your meal.I have not tried grinding them up. The other salt was not as hard crystals and added a lot of good flavor to the meals I added it to (sprinkling a little on top).I will not get this again. I will get the other again.It will last you forever unless you are a salt junky looking for high blood pressure, as this amount of salt is a HUGE amount of salt in you want to stay healthy. Just a tiny bit with each meal is plenty, and that is the problem here! The tiny bit doesn't impart much flavor or texture. The Brittany did."
1,Waste of Money,This product is a total farce. You might as well flush your money down the toilet. I use the real product that this junk reports to replace and it does nothing to mimic that product.
3,Hunt Videos,"Unlike Marley, I did expect this to be more of a 'how to' video.I also found that this video unfortunately covers a lot of the same ground and even the same footage as the 'Portrait of a Marine Artist' video. Both videos were certainly interesting for fans of Hunt and O'Brian, however I expected a little more on painting technique in a video titled ""Painting in the Studio"". His book ""The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt"" is very informative about the research behind each painting and I recommend it. I also thought both videos were rather short, but having said all that, I did enjoy them both."
1,"Buy other Bananas DVD, but not this one!","This guy fails at his attempt to make stupidity funny. I now what it means for something to be painful to watch. I didn't laugh once.If you want real laughs, try these other Banana DVDs: Jeff Allen, Mike Williams (hilarious), Taylor Mason (talented), Bob Stromberg (no one tells stories like this guy), Daren Streblow (the hot tub story will have you rolling on the floor crying if you are a man; it will have you scratching your head if you're a woman), Bob Nelson (this guy has more faces and voices than Carter has liver pills).I would also suggest that you get the Ken Davis & Friends DVD and the Ken Davis ""Lighten up and Laugh"" DVD. All of these are the kind of DVDs you'll watch again and again when you need a lift.But if you watch this Joby Saad DVD, my condolences. You were warned!"
2,could be better,"This book introduces several design patterns using finance as an example. The book is pretty thin for a $50 book, and can be read in under a week easily.I would recommend this book to MS/PHD students who want to become quants, but did not read the GoF book yet. Overall, the book is not too bad, if you are willing to spend $50 on it(library?).The author delivers books like hot buns, which does not look good to me. Quality beats Quantity.Pros:+ the code is clean and easy to read+ covers Monte Carlo and Trees, also Excel briefly+ the explanations are clear+ the material progresses from easy to hard nicelyCons:- high price- source code is not readily available, you would have to download it from different sources, and it will differ from the book, no makefiles- no big projects for the reader- PDE & interest rate models are not covered at all- no discussion of greeks for some reason- some important patterns are not covered- no errata"
3,Pressed & Formed Jerky,"I was hoping for the sort of salmon jerky where they cure whole slabs of salmon - but this was a pressed & formed sort of jerky. Different texture, and very different flavor from the ""unaltered"" salmon jerky.Great price, though, and it arrived quickly."
1,WARNING: CONTAINS MSG,"I love salmon and was very excited about having salmon jerky to keep at the office and take camping and skiing... until I got my order and found out that both flavors contain MSG, which gives some people (like me) whopping headaches. My wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture and our dogs love it, but I won't be trying it. To be fair, you might like this product if you aren't sensitive to MSG, but the seller should have noted that it contains a modern ingredient that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being ""made the old fashioned way."" On the plus side, shipping was very quick."
5,Great Buy,"If you love Full Metal Alchemist then you'll love owning the complete box set. The show itself has a deep storyline that grabs you combining the tragic loss of their mother, learning of life lessons, while driven by the determination to find the philosophers stone. It is a overall enjoyable must-see show for any anime fan. I highly recommend buying this product. Also, this is probably the best price on-line to find it."
5,An excellent book on what intimacy really is,"I'm only a few chapters into this book, but I already really like it. Matthew does a good job to explain that sex and intimacy are not the same thing at all. He describes four unique kinds of intimacy, in fact, and this really helped me understand why most past relationships struggled to achieve real serenity, even though I *thought* was doing the right things. Matthew's writing is very easy to follow and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about what's needed to nurture a lasting relationship, even as people change."
3,Disappointed,"As a Catholic reader, I was disappointed that this book was targeted at a general audience so there were no Christian references, only ideas. I thought the book was too verbose and anecdotal, and could have done with a more rigorous editing.I gave the same review to his previous book Rhythm of Life but here, I would add that Seven Levels repeats many of the same ideas from the previous book, even to the point of irrelevance.Buy Dream Manager by the same author. That's a 5-star"
1,If You Only Knew How Easy It Was,"This is a book of cotton-candy emotions for those for whom life is a street fair. In spite of its occasionally serious-sounding tone, it is not a ""how-to"" book about intimacy; it is less a map than a tour-guide. In spite of its perhaps unintentional allusion to the spiritual life (such as Merton's ""Seven Story Mountain,"" the number ""seven"" having spiritual significance), and its occasional references to things spiritual, there is no spiritual ""food"" here--nothing one has to chew on because every insight or obstacle or challenge is pureed enough to be sipped through a straw. Still, perhaps its popularity-- and its very aim is to be ""popular""-- says more about us as readers/consumers than it does about the writer. If that is the case then one cannot help but wonder whether the author's regard of us is more cynical than sincere."
3,Ok Doll,"I have a 2 year old dora lover so when I see anything dora I feel that I have to have it. This is an ok doll, and was not too expensive. The leg of the daoll was ripped off in a ""tug of war fight"" with her five year old brother, and we replaced the leg with a safety pin (will have to see how long that holds). There are peices of yarn and thread that keep comming undone, and so far we just cut them off. I am waiting to see how long the doll will hold up before comming all the way undone. But in the meantime, my 2 year old does seem to like this doll so for that it was worth the purchase."
1,Worst I have every seen!!!,The quality is very very very very.... bad!!!The Anime is very good. But because of the bad quality this is a worse product I have ever seen.
3,pretty average,I found this book pretty average. I have several books on Whitetail hunting this one was about mid pack. Nothing that isn't in almost any other Whitetail book.
1,Very disappointing!,"I have never written a review before but I am so disappointed in this product I felt I needed to warn others.I have a very advanced 6 year old son who loves dinosaurs. He was unable to get any of the pieces to stay together by himself. The pieces do not click together and once they are finally together, they fall apart easily. I do not understand how it can be so difficult to get pieces to go together only to have them easily fall apart. One half of the jaw did not even match up with the other half. The internal organs will not stay attached to the spinal cord and the rib cage falls apart if not being held together. After 30 minutes of working on it myself and not getting it to stay together we put it back in the box.The instructions are poorly written and obviously not edited by an English speaking person.The concept is great, but very poorly constructed especially for being advertised for 6 year olds."
4,GREY'S SOUNDTRACK CD.....A WINNER,"Like anything associated with this great show, Volume 2 of the Grey's Anatomy Soundtrack is great. But not as great as listening to the music while watching the show simultaneously, I'm afraid. The music is unique, creative and non-trendy. All pluses. Unfortunately, the soundtrack CD's of Grey's Anatomy do not contain pop-up images of Drs. Shepherd, Blake and Karev! ):"
4,Great Mix of music !!!,"Yes, I AM a fan of Grey's Anatomy, BUT, now I'm even a bigger fan of the soundtrack! The people who put this mix together have wonderful taste in music. Im 45 years old and would rather listen to this stuff, than the stuff from my 20's ... I tell everyone I know about this mix."
2,Not very good...,"My wife got the 1st one and it was good. She expected the second to be more of the same quality, but it wasn't. Stick with the 1st and see if others come out beyond the 2nd album..."
3,Lovely book for the Victorian & Edwardian art scholar,"I purchased this book primarily because I wanted to relive a very pleasant afternoon spent in 1977 when I first visited the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight, Chesire, Gr. Britain.This book is beautifully illustrated with many black and white illustrations plus full page color photos -- though I must admit I wish there'd been more color used.My only critique concerns the actual tone of the book: it is really aimed at the art scholar than the casual observer and thus it would have more appeal to someone who had studied the art in the Victorian & Edwardian eras.All things said, I don't regret purchasing this book and it brought back many happy memories for me."
4,PRETTY GOOD,This album is not as good as the old one. The old one was mainly ballads. But now their songs r more up beat. The songs in their old album is betta. They new album is pretty good so dats y I give it 4 starz.
2,bad quality,did not like this item. They were very thin and tore while just putting them on. We have a set of other ones that are very think and durable. These were not good at all.
1,Bad Seller,"I recieved this VHS tape broken and in pieces, I wrote the seller, never heard back, no legible return address on package, i also wrote amazon and never recieved answer from them , it did not cost much, but it is useless, this seller should be banned from selling on amazon"
2,DOA,"Sadly this copy I received did not work well on my system at all. After working with all sorts of different solutions, I had to go back to my older video card and I sent this one back. I'm sure that there are copies out there that worked great, but sadly this one did not."
4,Laughing out loud funny,I just about died reading this. Hilarious. My only complaint is that it didn't cover all the people I want to voodoo. You will laugh out loud
3,Warning about compatibility with base stations,"While in Hong Kong 6 months ago I bought 2 rtx 3008 base stations and phones to replace my dying dualphone (lasted for 5 years). Recently I wanted additional handsets so purchased on line via amazon 4 extra handsets, I could not get the base station to register them, a check with RTX, they confirmed that FCC phone and non FCC base stations are not compatible. You have open the phone battery compartment up and check the the label to confirm which type of phone you have."
1,This phone is not reliable.,It's not a reliable product. The phone worked fine for a couple of calls. Then it became non-responsive. Can't get it to work again. The manufacturer used the cheapest plastic possible to make this phone. I will be returning this phone immediately.
2,Buyer Beware,"From Day 1, this handset was flaky. Lag when dialing numbers, sometimes would need to power off phone, and then power phone back on. Lots of echo in a lot of the phone calls. As others have mentioned, keys are very stiff. That I can handle. What I wasn't too thrilled about was when the handsets just plain stopped connecting to Skype after just over a year of use, out of nowhere. Router registered the bases' IP address, so that wasn't the problem. For what I paid for this originally, over 200 dollars, I am very dissappointed. I switched to Nettalk DUO after that, using an old landline phone complete with an answering machine, and all the features including long distance, and HALF the cost of skype (only 30 a year, which is basically what you pay for a landline number with skype, plus the $3 a month) and I've been much happier. Much better quality for way less cost. I would highly recommend staying away from this piece of junk."
1,"Passes ""Skype"" Standards...","Which means that, those guys in Taiwan don't have a clue!Being the ONLY typical ""home"" telephone Skype supports this: ""cheaply made, LOW speaker & ringer quality, DROPPING calls constantly"" telephone should be avoided...But wait, I need a telephone to use with my Skype service, without having to have my computer running or wearing those stupid-looking Headphone/Mic combos!!Geez...that only leaves this lousy RTX Dualphone 3088 series, right?!yeah, until the makers of the RTX dualphone 3088 step up and fix this junk of theirs...I honestly don't know of another VOIP phone maker that we CAN use Skype with!!I wasted $169+tax+shipping...but hey, I did get rid of Vonage & my ISP's ""hostage"" telephone services!!(wasn't there suppose too be an UP-Side to this??)"
5,Fly Fishing the Mountain Lakes (Summer of Discovery Series),"I loved this book! Gary is a great writer and makes his books full of well researched,sound information. In this small volume he tells you where the lakes are (they really exist where he says-I checked topos!) and challenges you to go! Wonderful, fun book!!"
3,"Creative science, but ....","The reviews had me hooked, and alot of the science is very original, but I could not relate to the main character. I agree with the reviewer who said there should be a prequel. I did try to like this book, but the writing style left me cold."
4,Good book,"The book was in good condition, and was a lot cheaper in price then buying it at the local bookstore, fast shipping, and handling was a nice surprise."
5,"Excellent review and study guide, buy it for this test!","I used this guide and also reviewed the questions in the Official CLEP Study Guide for this test. I read the material once, and did 1 1/2 of the practice exams and read through the answers. The coverage was good, there is a lot of material, however like always guage your own abilities and retention when determining study time. I scored a 68 on this test. Good luck."
2,CLEP Western Civilization 1 w/CD-ROM,This book did not help at all. It covered about 10 questions that were on the test. I suggest using other study material.
1,all remakes - not the orignal version,BUYER BEWARE - there is no indication anywhere on the CD that these are NOT the original top 40 hits. BOO! **no stars**I would have given this a star IF they would have at least put a disclaimer on the CD stating the above. Shame!These are all terrific songs but can't hold a candle to the originals - what? they couldn't get the license rights? - nor do they ADD anything to the songs.Inferior. Avoid. Move on.
3,entertaining,"This short story had me hooked from the start. While it certainly has room for growth and the story line could have been a little more developed, I did not want to put it down. A good entertaining quick read"
1,This is really sick book,"This book gets away with its machismo and inhumaneness by being placed in a ""cultural diversity-old world charm"" perspective. The theme of ""boys will be boys"" is presented as integral to family humor, ""male bonding,"" and a cute old grandfather.""Tom"" is unfit for children. It teaches that it's cool to be cruel without any comparable teaching about what animal slaughter truly entails or how the girls feel being taunted by twisted little boys. At the end grandfather and grandson are ""wink[ing]"" and ""think[ing] of something else to do."""
5,Perfect boat for 1 to 4 adults,"Perfect. Stable even for 1 adult. Better for balance if there are 2 in front seats. Very maneuvreable and stable. Cover is ithended to give shade from the sun, not protect from the rain. Highly recommend: lightweight, well build. Delivery was in 10 days. I live in Atlanta area."
2,Dissapointed in Amazon,"My Sun slider arrived last week, Put it on the lake a few minutes after it arrived. Very please although it should be rated as a two man and 3 little kid Pedal boat. It's even to small for my 150 lb. dog to go for a ride. Now here is the big shock I paid 799.00 + a total of 849.00. One week later Amazon is selling the boat for 549.00. Both with free shiping. I contacted Amazon as we have been very good prime customers since they started. The reply was not at all helpful. "" You can send it back but since it isn't our fault you have to pay the shipping $150.00"". And have it packaged. Needless to say I'm dissapointed in Amazon as every box store will refund or credit you if they change a price with-in 30 days."
4,Good speakers,"These speakers don't seem to have quite the space in the sound my old 301s had, but they still provide a very realistic sound. They seem to be a little heavy on the bass response for me, I would like a little more emphasis on the treble as I listen to classical music. They are still very good speakers, though, and the instruments are all clearly and individually defined. Make sure you get them up off he floor, though. On the floor the sound is muddy."
5,"Bose, why'd I wait","I recently purchased the Bose 301V's to replace an older pair of 201's. Wow, the 301's are well worth the investment. The Harman/Kardon HK3490 receiver I have powering the 301's completely fills my living room with anything I care to listen to. The bass response is incredible for ""bookshelf speakers"". Not being a fan of subwoofers when listening to music I'm happy to say you don't need one unless deep thumping base is a must have. Don't wait any longer if you're thinking about getting these."
2,Out of Date,"Although the book was helpful in providing information which can be universally used, it was published in 1999, and since new tools have been developed since then and therefore are not included in the book, its practical use is limited."
5,Great book for anyone doing business for the first time with Chinese business people.,Great book. Was able to apply some of the principles I learned during negotations with Chinese business men from the mainland. Gave my copy to a colleague why is doing business in China.
1,Hampered by Bad Writing,"I must say I've seen the same philosophy explained better elsewhere. You would be well advised to go to the primary sources, because this book is so poorly written it's unreadable. Check out my reviews and you will see I give as many 5-star reviews as 1-star reviews, but I can't recommend this book."
2,Hard to Follow,"biggest complaint is no table of contents. How do you make a guide book that mentions so many different places and not have a table of contents for quick, specific reading? We have to read the whole thing and bookmark things of interest. Thankfully we already have the paper version and just picked this up for road travel. Disappointing to be sure... NOT easy to find things..."
1,Lonely Planet did not do their homework for this version,"Just came back from a recent trip to New Zealand with the Lonely Planet in tow. My husband and I were very disappointed with the most recent version of the Lonely Planet. We found lots of errors - the LP recommended restaurants that no longer existed, recommended holiday parks that I wouldn't stick my big toe in, and were consistently wrong on pricing from the cable car in Wellington to ferry rides across the Cook Strait. I think you would be just as well off buying the old version. It seems to be the same. It seems the LP writers didn't do their homework this time around."
4,Very cute but very breakable!,"My eight year old daughter got the Melissa and Doug Victorian Dollhouse for Christmas last year. We've been purchasing the furniture ever since. This set, as with all the sets, is very pretty and very detailed - but be warned, for children who really play with their dollhouses, the spindly construction leads to lots of breakages. I wish Melissa and Doug would make these a bit more durable. The children I know who play with them aren't collecting, at least not yet."
5,Lovely furniture!,"The quality was much better than I expected for the price, and my 3-year old daughter was delighted."
5,A Master Storyteller,"Some authors you read because the journey is better than the destination, but I find with Blake it's the opposite. His action and storytelling outweigh his poetry, although there is poetry, to be sure. He writes with a passion and moves with a purpose. And yes, as other reviews state here, he does not disappoint."
4,NIce.. but small,"NIce.. Smaller than I thought. Works well. Pellets clear it fine... As I hoped, It takes great aim to hit the small targets!! Builds your ability. I like it.BTW,I use it for airsoft also. (airsoft does not have enough power to reset) That is not the product's fault.. BUT the kids love to keep shooting at this target with that style gun."
4,Drug and sensory...,"I am still reading this fascinating factual assessment into the drug and sensory trip or trips into the supernatural...Graham Hancock has never failed to put all the cards on the table when researching the accessibilityto the supernatural. Never contrived never second hand information. IF YOU ARE LOOKING forwhat IS OUT THERE and awaiting you, please treat this as close as you are going to get by just reading...."
3,Supernatural,I thoroughly enjoyed the first 6 chapters of the book but then grew a bit tired of looking at the rock art and found that the descriptions were not what I was seeing. It gave me the impression that the rock art had been stared at for years thus allowing new ideas to formulate that seemed far from the first impression of viewing the art. I didn't finish it but then am not an academic and not am more interested in human behavior than in 'abstract art'. I have no doubt that this book would be very interesting and rewarding for the right person.
5,DNA and DMT,"Graham Hancock is not a scientist but I believe that this is a positive rather than a negative. David Hancock has this gifted skill to be able to keep the scientists honest by asking the pertinent questions. He also gets into the drama of the paddock where the action is unlike many who offer opinions without leaving their desks.This book is a serious attempt to inform man that his fate does not hinge on the dogma's of man created religions but on his own free will and his spirit that is linked to his DNA.An important read for people that, like Graham Hancock, ask the questions .... GJ Crabb"
2,Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind,"It lost my interest quickly. I found it to be to strange. However I will try to understand it, because I have read reviews of Graham Hancocks that are positive."
3,Solid but not great,"BT seems like someone who still needs to find his niche. Maybe this was just a little too long for him. He had some solid material (kept me smiling, not laughing) but few of the jokes had me really rolling. I think he could have filled 20-30 minutes with his best stuff more comfortably."
2,A bit disappointed.,"The polish appeared to be genuine OPI, and it arrived promptly. However, the polish appeared new but was actually old and too thick."
3,First Half class,Well its the first half of the class. Just keep that in mind. The second half is also available here on Amazon or on Itunes. On the Bikram webite you'll only find the double CD but not as a download.In my opinion Bikram yoga is not yoga. It's more an interval training based on yoga postures performed in a 105 deg. F. hot and sweaty petri dish.One advantage I must admit I have noticed is an expansion of the breathing/aerobic capacity.
3,"great movie, slow soundtrack","All i wanted was the last song of the album, which if the only song on the whole album that is not an instumental. Knowing that everyone would want this song amazon did the same thing as i-tunes and made you buy the whole album to get it. The rest of the album is ok but i wish these companies would stop making the only good song album only."
3,Silent 1925 she is worth seeing...if you saw the other versions..,"Very interesting film, its also a silent one...but with a good soundtrack forbackground. i saw this film when i was young...30-40 years ago and again didnotice the eternal flame is just some kind of veil blowing in the wind givingthe illusion of a flame..still well done for its time. Having the other 2 versions of the film she...this silent version is a very needed addition. Thanks to Sinister cinema for making it available."
4,What/When's next?,"I liked the story but, like the first book, it doesn't have an end. For such a short book (200 pages), there is a lot of action. This continuing story line would be ok, but the time between books is frustrating.I've been contacted one publishing house, mistaking me for the author, wanting to know about re-releasing the series and the next book. I only wish I knew where this guy is and, like all the others here, when the next book is due out.Mark, if you're out there, make the next book at least twice as long if book #4 isn't going to get here by 2000."
5,DESPERATELY SEEKING SEQUAL,"I FIRST CAME ACCROSS THESE NOVELS IN THE EARLY 80'S, AND THEY BLEW ME AWAY. THE CHARACTERS SWEPT YOUR MIND INTO A RICH COLORFUL WORLD WHERE YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR THE BATTLES, SMELL THE WARS AND FEEL THE PAIN OF THE CURSED ELF. THE BOOKS STUCK IN MY MIND AND MY BOOKSHELF, AVOIDING THE DREADED GARAGE SALE CLEARENCE, TIME AND AGAIN. WHEN I LOGGED ONTO AMAZON, I SEARCHED FOR A SEQUAL. TOO BAD. PUBLISHER GET ON THIS!!! CONTACT THE AUTHOR AND LIGHT A FIRE UNDER HIS BOTTOM! IF THE OTHER COMENTS ON THIS PAGE ARE ANY INDICATION, THERE ARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATED READERS OUT HERE!"
2,A fun and entertaining book!,Fascinating Facts is filled with information on topics from thefirst humans to religion to space. It is a great tool for elementaryteachers and parents of children in elementary. There were many interesting facts that even I didn't know. This book definitely stirs a child's imagination.
3,Collected best works stands as what it is,"If you like Charlie's music but don't want to buy all his albums to get the best songs then this is a good choice, gave a copy to my Brother in law and he seems to love it. I got it for Rolling with the flow and was quite satisfied with my purchase."
4,perfect 1080i,"going form and LG blu ray player to full HD DLP projector via an HDMI switch and about 125ft of cheap non-name-brand cable works great at 1080i. 1080p introduces digital snow, but possibly a result of the switch. can't remember if it might have been a bit cheaper when i got it a few months ago, but works as advertised."
2,"Good for a theater, not for a stereo.","These speakers aren't bad sounding, they just are not great speakers. They sound best at low volume. They sound good at less than 10 watts, but not so great above that. Bass is weak from these units.If you want good Bose sound at least go with the 301's.I got rid of the 201's and replaced them with Sony SS-B3000's which have better bass response and simply sound much better at less than half the price."
2,I've own the Bose 201 for years.,"People are very loyal to their brands and Bose is no execption. I've owned many different models of higher end bose speakers for many years; including the lower end 201 bookshelf speakers. I'm about to reitre them as there are too many better speakers out there for the money. The bose speakers are great for people who lack a good ear for music and love a dead sounding speaker, meaning the highs aren't real high and the mid range is ok but there is more low range. You can adjust your tuner receiver all you want, but it's tough to really get the Bose to come to life like other speakers. I love Bose but will retire my 201 when the new speakers arrive.....for less money than the 201 but with much fuller sound that really comes to life.Bose speakers are great for people who lack a trained ear, and those stuck in the 1970s......"
1,Derivative,I am growing plenty sick of US distributors pumping out this evangelion-inspired garbage lacking in originality with hideous design choices and gratuitous use of ugly CG. Just say no.
3,"I dont know, this show is getting annoying.","I just watched the first 4 episodes and I am getting kind of turned off by the environmentalist type stuff in the series. Wanting to stop polution and stuff is good just keep it out of my Anime. The artwork and english dubbing is verry good, though the CG could have been better in the way of character designs. Hopefully the plot will start going somewhere soon, mabe the next couple of episode will redeem my interest. I still have hope that this series can get better, so hopefully it will."
4,Good for the price,"This is a pretty good product. Especially for a puppy. Our puppy is crate trained, but we do not like to keep him caged up in his crate when we know we will be gone for a few hours. So we have his crate inside of this play pen and he can go in his crate to nap, or come out and play with his toys, stretch his legs in this pen. We just up-sized him to his larger crate and attached this Pen to his crate so that he still has enough room to play in. Also good to have something to put him in while we are doing things that need to be done around the house. When he gets older and better trained, we will probably do away with the pen."
5,Pet Exercise Pen,This pen is so easy to set up and use. There is nothing to put together. It keeps our dogs safe and secure. I recommend this product.
2,Bad Memory,"This is a book of Gellhorns recollections of trips thru China, Africa and Africa.Her writing is such,... so lacking in substance that you feel she is making it up. It doesn't feel genuine. PLUS! and here's the real killer... SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER!. All through the book she states how she doesn't remember this or that, so often that the whole book comes onto question. The trip to China with her then husband Ernest Hemingway was a total blow out. She wasn't sure about anything.The second story, her first trip to Africa, was the best in the bunch.The last trip to Africa was totally unbelievable. Fiction.She can not remember enough to make a coherent record of her journeys.Also for someone who loves to travel and has spent her life doing so all around the world-- she has no camera! No interest in them. No pictures.I've also read 'The View from the Ground' and wasn't impressed."
3,"Avoids some sports cliches, a bit uneasy with its setting","Fans of typical cinderella-team sports movies may find this worth watching, even though its a a genre long run out of anything entirely different to do. There is a bit of room here for surprises and avoidance of usual cliches, but don't expect totally amazing new ground. This time its about a soccer team in Scotland. This genre, more familiarly set in America, doesn't seem entirely at home in its new setting. The Scottish flavor is somewhat represented, but there's always a feeling that the performers may not be quite at home in the different cultural setting. The generally impressive actor Robert Duvall is the lead as the team's coach. He doesn't seem entirely comfortable with his affected Scottish accent, and occasionally seems to lose focus on it, drifting back into sounding more like an American. Nonetheless there's some drama worth sticking with this for, especially in the second half, after a sometimes slow start."
1,"Wheatless, Glutenless, FLAVORLESS","My best friend has Celiac, and doesn't do much from-scratch baking, so I am in search of a good chocolate cake mix for her. This is not it. I bought the chocolate frosting of the same brand, and it was quite good - it carried the cake, in fact. Until I had a bite of just cake, I had no idea that it didn't have any flavor. Seriously. No. Flavor. Not even cardboard flavor. Flavorless fluff. Very disappointing. Now I know why my friend doesn't ever want to experiment with wheat/gluten free cooking."
2,Ripped the first time out,"The day after Thanksgiving we drove out to the Desert, and set up my New Surrender the booty Pirate Flag. by Sunday Morning when we were taking the flag down, we had notice that the top of the flag where the grommet is attached was ripped. This was the first time we used this flag and it had already ripped. the winds were about 20mph.The flag was very nice looking until this happen.We were very disappointed.Thank youHoward Felix"
3,Not enough hours in the day,"First let me say that I love Oprah. I could so relate to her struggle with food. However, I do get annoyed when childless people tell us that we must ""make more time for ourselves."" I had plenty of time to work on myself before kids; now I don't, period! If you follow Bob's rules for warm up, stretch, warm up (again), work out, cool down, stretch (whew!) you'll be taking at least an hour a day for yourself. If you have kids and you work, Bob, it ain't happening. I had to chuckle when Oprah said she would have to wake up an hour earlier (5:00am) to fit a work out into her busy schedule. I've been getting up at 5:00am for the last 7 years (since kids) and that's just to get the housework done. I guess I have to be ""more commited"" to myself and get up at 4:00am. Was there a chapter on sleep deprivation?"
5,I'm making the connection!,"For years I've struggled with my weight but now I feel I've found the answer! Oprah and Bob Greene's book is THE BEST! It's still a struggle day by day but now I know the best way to go about things and how to approach it, rather than being on diet after diet, year after year! My son has special needs and has been ill all over Christmas. I find I comfort eat when there are difficulties but writing it all down in my journal does really help! I too hate the water still and have to ""force"" it down, but force it down I do and I hope to reap the benefits soon. I've only just started my connection but I can ""feel"" this is the answer and can't wait for the coming months and for my lovely slim strong body to be set free from under all this gross clinging fat! Here's to Oprah and Bob - a million thanks!"
4,Inspiring,"It's funny how many people say Oprah's never written a memoir. This book is definitely her story. I admire her all the more after reading about her struggle with food and her weight. She is an amazing and inspiring woman, and even though I won't be getting up at 5am to exercise as she does, I took away a lot from reading this book. Bob Greene was just icing on the cake."
5,excellent book,"I have been dieting for 14 months now. Having read and using some of the ideas in the book ""The Best Life"" by Bob Green, I thought I would check out more of his books. The ""Make the Connection"" book is very good. It has continued to help me in my endeavor to lose weight. I am currently down 108 pounds with only 66 pounds to goal. If you are needing to lose some weight then I suggest you check out Bob's book. It will help you along the way."
5,This book gets to the root of my lifelong weight struggle.,"I've spent the past two years starting a new diet every 3 days or so, wondering desperately why none of them have ever worked. In his well-written and easy-to-read book, Bob Greene explains how making the connection -- identifying and resolving the underlying reasons behind eating -- can help me get my body into better shape permanently. It's not a magic formula, and will undoubtedly take a concentrated effort daily, but the end results will be worth it! I can identify with Oprah Winfrey's struggles, also. Reading her journal entries about her struggles with food almost made me cry."
2,Needs balance,"This is a good book with a lot of historical information and quotes, but it is the usual kind of scholarly approach that one finds to Christianity (like few other subjects): An investigation for which the author already knows the answer. I would rather see something a bit more open-minded than the sort of ""writing the facts to fit the opinion"" that usually comes to religion. For instance the entire concept of Jesus's ""Kingdom of God"" has only one possible meaning to the author; suffice it to say this is not so for a great many scholars, theologists and spiritualists. Rather disappointing for something that came through the Oxford University Press."
4,Nice pair of speakers,"Bought a pair of these to replace an old 1980's pair of inexpensive Radio Shack speakers. Work just fine in the 16 x 20 room I placed them in. At the 50watts/channel I supply them with, (I rarely pass volume setting 2 on a 1-10 scale), they have more than sufficient bass and enough treble to satisfy my easy listening preferences and sound like speakers 2x their size. They are solid, well made, attractive speakers and they come with a 5 year warranty from Bose which I doubt I'll ever need."
4,iPod Dummy's Review,"I bought the iH52B Bookshelf System for iPods for my husband for Christmas. As a non-ipod user, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but my husband was quite thrilled with it. The one thing I did not like about it, was the speaker was huge and there were so many wires. But the sound is great and the look is sleek"
3,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"If your allready familur with Mortiis, than this album will probably dissapoint you. Like 'SMELL OF RAIN', 'GRUDGE' is highly influenced by Trent Reznor Of NIN. Sadly, unlike 'SMELL OF RAIN', there is something about this album that just doesn't keep the listener's attention...it has no stay power. If your new to Mortiis, I strongly suggest 'SMELL OF RAIN' or 'STARGATE' as your intro albums to the bazaar world of Gothic/ExpereMetal/Lord Of The Rings sounding music that Mortiis has created. 'Grudge' is really not nearly as entertaining of an album as his previous two releases. That is what Mortiis is isn't he...an entertainer? Certainly he's not trying to convince us that he is a real troll, or elf, or whatever th hell he is supposed to be. Anyways, don't bother with 'Grudge'....'Smell Of Rain' or 'Stargate' are much, much better albums."
5,This is definitly their best album yet!!!,"DC Talk has out done themselves with this album. They mix many creative rythms and vocals to create one of the most unique and up beat sounds that is sure to set any christain, rock-loving person's spirit on fire for Christ! With ""My Friend"" they seem to have bridged the gap from Christain Pop charts to the Billboard Rock/Pop charts! A Philedelphia radio station frequently plays this song as a big hit in popularity for this area. That right there shows that DC Talk had to have done something right! If you haven't heard any of their CD's this is the one to hear. I recommend that you get it even if you aren't a Christain!"
5,This CD is Supernatural!,"It is so cool. If you want to listen to good Christian music that doesn't blow your ears out or make you fall asleep, this is the CD for you! And another thing, DC Talk is a very spiritual band and speaks to people all over the world with their amazing lyrics and tunes. Once you listen to DC Talk, your hooked on them for life! So go out there and tell the world about DC Talk!"
1,What Happened to that Rock?,I found this CD was not their style and was more easy-listening music. What Happended to their Rock Cd that made their name in christian music? I totally Hated this CD
1,Not As Good,"Compared to Jesus Freak, this album really is a let down. Okay for a little while, but not as classic as its predecessor. A few cool tunes (""Red Letters"") but too many fillers - and what's up with the ""Titanic dead people"" looking pictures of the band on the inside?!"
5,"like it, love it, NEED it? YES","When i first heard that dcTalk had a new album out, i thought "" oh brother, why should they even try to make another cd, they couldnt possibly get any better than *Jesus Freak*."" Then a couple days later i bought ""WoW 1999"", and the song *Into Jesus* was on it, and it wasn't a bad song at all, as a matter of fact i liked it very much. I received the cd for Christmas, so i put it into my cd player, and i listened to the first song ""It's killing me"", and it was a pretty cool song. and then i heard ""Dive"", which was even cooler. I listened to ""Consume Me"", and it was a good song too. My favorite songs on the cd are: ""Supernatural ""Dive"" ""It's Killing Me"" ""Red Letters ""Since I Met You"" ""My Friend(So Long)"" ""Fearless"" ""Into Jesus"" ""Consume Me"" ""We All Wanna Be Loved"" ""The Truth"" ""Godsend""Wait a minute, that's *ALL* the songs on the cd, LOLThe cd's great, buy it without thinking twice!"
4,"Not as good as ""Jesus Freak""","""Supernatural"" is certainly an excellent CD. But not as good as ""Jesus Freak."" I rate CDs on 5 categories: Vocals, Lyrics, Music Quality (instruments & mixing), Creativity, and Power (how it all comes together, makes you feel, etc.). Using these categories, I will compare ""Jesus Freak"" with ""Supernatural.""Vocals -- Jesus Freak: A- Supernatural: ALyrics -- Jesus Freak: A+ Supernatural: A-Music Quality -- Jesus Freak: A- Supernatural: BCreativity -- Jesus Freak: A+ Supernatural: B+Power -- Jesus Freak: A+ Supernatural: A-Overall GPA -- Jesus Freak: 4.06 (A+) Supernatural: 3.54 (A-)Overall, I highly recommend Supernatural.Great God-inspired lyrics (as usual for DC Talk), but on average a bit less conspicuously Christian. This may be good, because it may draw in a more secular audience, who might ultimately experience the ""witness"" of DC Talk's lyrics -- either through this album or by becoming a fan, and purchasing older albums as well.-TJS"
3,Good...but too different,"Well..when everyone thought dcTalk would do it again...they failed, at least in my eyes. Supernatural is a great piece of lyrical work but the music gets kinda monotonous in like Consume me and Godsend. The chainsaw guitars of ""Jesus Freak"" dissapeared and the funky drums of ""Dive started playing a major role. This album is very good and i might give it four stars if i didn't know dcTalk's potential. DcTalk is a band destined for fame and there is no album better than Jesus Freak so i guess i didn't expect them to top it. Hopefully dcTalk will go back to the alternative/hard rock of jesus freak but still keep the lyrical content and mix of mellowness. Supernatural is a good album..don't get me wrong, just duzn't live up to dcTalk's potential which wuz a little bit dissapointing..but good job guys!!! i'm proud to say your my favorite band"
5,Diversely praising God!!,They have done it again!! But would've been better if they had Wil Denton playing drums.
2,Umm.......Not Quite,"This is certainly an interesting CD. dC Talk is definitely umm...searching. They couldn't seem to decide what they were doing on this album. I also thought Kevin Smith's voice got kind of annoying. This album didn't have much to hold it together. Some good, some bad. ""Jesus Freak"" was better."
2,Not very smooth,"My little girl is crazy about rocks! This was her big present for Christmas one year. It took seven days to produce just a few rocks and they weren't even very shiny. There were several processes she had to do over the seven days, and we had to keep it turned on and going the whole time. She never played with it again, because the results were not worth the effort."
5,Just cool brings me back,Kids loved it... the rocks were awesome- it takes a long time but well worth it... we tried a cheaper one from a discount retailer and it leaked and didn't work- this product was perfect.... we are planning on polishing more soon!
1,Boring.,I managed to get as far as page 242 before I just gave it up and I only got that far because it was the only novel I had with me on a long plane flight. The story just drags on without all that much happening. Boring is the word for it.
3,"Sometimes has a strong positive message, sometimes doesn't.","The works of the young women are excellent, and Ms. Carlip should be commended for including such groups as sorority girls and beauty queens is the book, but I think it could have been helpful for her to include more on the currently relevant topics, such as teen mothers, lesbian and bisexual girls, and even rappers and skaters. These sections are good, but too short. I believe that there are more female skaters and rappers who have trouble with low self esteem and being accepted for who they are than girls in sororities."
3,I've Heard Better Oktoberfest CD's,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. This CD was disappointing because it contains only twelve selections, and a significant number of them are not really appropriate for Oktoberfest."
5,brilliant,"I was recommended a book called Natural Ways To Better Babies,after I had my second miscarriage. I need to find out where I can get hold of this book. Thank-you desparate."
3,Fighting Spirit,"Basically it's about a bunch of Japanese martial arts experts harassing a Chinese village on the lookout for the sectret 'dragon herb'. The Japs face hard resistance from the Chinese fighters who run a martial arts academy up in the mountains. Unanticipated assistance in terms of fighting expertise, however, comes from a refugee on the run.The fighting scenes are not very realistic but cool anyway. A classic!"
2,Does not work as well,When computer shuts down my monitor and printer do not turn off as it says in the instructions. I have adjusted the set screw and it still does not turn off the monitor or printer when computer shuts down.
2,Unreliable,"I'd really like to believe in this product, as it's a great idea. Unfortunately, it's too unreliable in my setting to trust. I tried using an older desktop computer on the control circuit. The computer draws 80W at idle and 3W when ""off."" After adjusting per instructions, the strip correctly turned off the peripherals when the computer was turned off. The next morning the peripherals were on again. More tweaking, and now the peripherals only sometimes came on with the computer. Back and forth... I gave up on this after a couple of weeks. I'm having trouble imagining what they put in here that makes the turn off point drift around so much, but it makes it unusable for the advertised purpose - at least with my hardware. On the other hand, it's an okay vanilla power strip."
3,"Good product, but nothing amazing.","Replaced all my strips at home with these, I have yet to be amazed. Feels like a waste of money."
4,"nice idea, but does not work with some wireless devices","Using a Logitech Squeezebox as the control does not work - the squeezebox draws 2-3 watts regardless of whether it is on or ""off"", so the SmartStrip cannot be adjusted to tell the whether the squeezebox is on or off. I would recommend getting a kilowatt beforehand to meter your intended control device to make sure you can use it the way you want."
4,Save energy & money,"I bought two Smart Strips and had a problem with one of them because of the device I had plugged into the control outlet. Support people are great, took a week or so to figure out what was happening but they did and are going to send me a new unit which corrects the problem."
4,We love this series,"It is a sweet, gentle show. No murders, just little local crimes to be solved by this gentle rotund detective who would rather be cooking. It is not one of the best shows ever but it is very enjoyable. ""Margaret"" and ""Fisher"" (the constipated chief) are particularly good supporting actors, as is ""Henderson"" the veggie farmer."
5,Life in Phoenix,"I saw this film about two years ago. I was on a business trip and was checking the channels. Something about this film caught my eye and I watched it. I was in tears! This is quite possibly one of the funniest ideas ever found on the screen. Brook's use of involving his character with the family he's presenting to the public is brilliant. The reaction of the family is histerical. And one only needs to watch for ten minutes to see one of the camermen (""the latest in technology for 1979!""), one terrific idea again."
3,Buyer Be Warned: Good Movie for a Narrow Target Audience...,"I bought this movie because I was impressed with Megan Fox's acting and good looks in Transformers 2 (a surprisingly engaging and amusing SciFi). This movie had the best rating of any of her other movies, so I decided to buy it.I give ""Crimes of Fashion"" three stars as a good (meaning wholesome,entertaining) movie for its intended audience. In my opinion, that audience is the Hanna Montana set (young girls, 12 - 15 year of age). I believe all others will regret paying the money.That said, I was impressed with Kaley Cuoco's stage presence, fitality, and acting ability. She reminds me of the young actresses in ""Chasing Liberty"" and ""What a Girl Wants"" (both of which appeal to braoder, and older, audiences).Luckily, I have someone who will appreciate receiving it as a gift."
5,Excellent sequel.,"This movie was as good as the first one. Fans get their first look at Jason, who is avenging his mother's death. Jason was misunderstood. This movie is basically like the first one. Another good horror."
2,Not as good as the first.,"The story was good, but the acting was something to be desired. The only one who acted good enough was Jason."
2,Jason as played by Lloyd Mangram out of Commodore Force,"There are some genuinely good sequences in this film such as Ginny pretending to be Jason's mother, the dream sequence at the start of the film and the cop chasing a mysterious figure to its lair. But unfortunately the horror seems to be kept to a minimum, endless boring teenagers faffing about and a lifelss plot. Jason, when revealed, lacks the intimidating presence he has in later films of this series, seems just to be a 'bloke with a bag over his head' who keeps falling over. Thankfully, Part 3 is much better."
1,Part 2 lame and idiotic,"I am a fan of the first ""Friday the 13th."" It managed to create enough suspence and thrills to keep the viewer involved in what was happening in the screen in front of them. That's why I loathe ""Part 2"" so sincerly. It replaces suspence and scares with too much blood and cheap surprises. The only thing more rediculous than the acting is Jason's 'disguise'at the end, which is a pillow case over his head. To see a slow, pudgy man running around with a pillow case covering his face with two eyeholes poked thru pretty much defeats any chance of suspence that could have been saved during the final fifteen minutes. A simply ludicrious movie, the worst in the ""Friday"" series."
4,the best of the series,"If you were dispoint like me over the remake of first three movies. stick to the base. They should have stop at film four and let Jason burn in hell. This is best one of series, because at the time this was new and fresh. Jason was not turn into a zombie, but he did come from the dead. I think this one and part 3 and part 4 were the best. If live in Connecticut and grew up as kid in 1980's Friday was film once here and it is part of one childhood. Sad and sick as it sound. Jason is movie monster of my generation. This film you still could tell Jason was human and more believe then later films."
3,Better Than The First,"This is my favourite Friday the 13th film ever. It's a little better than the first.The actors aren't as popular as the first, but they do a good job. A good job at dying that is. There are more victims, but less gore than the first. Also the ending is scarier than the first. Big man Jason Voorhees gets his revenge, using machetes, ropes, and knives. He also spears a couple in bed.This makes up to be a very good sequel, but there are many questions, like how did Jason get so big after five years from being the same size he was when he was eleven? Complicated questions. But who cares, this is the best sequel to Friday the 13h ever.Rent it if you haven't seen it."
4,Better than the original!,Perhaps the best sequel to a horror franchise ( other than psycho 2). What seperates this from the first one is the scares! There's heaps of them!!! Amy Steele gives a good performance and the chase scenes between her and Jason are truly suspenceful. Not as gory as the original but still heaps of fun!!!
3,Better than the original............,"I liked this movie and found it to be better than the original. It was more interesting and the pace was faster. I also liked the performances and the characters, and the opening scene was really scary and intense, especially late at night. i wish all the installments could be this good."
2,The only semi C- (passing) sequel,"Although there are some real fallbacks that jock part 1 way too much this tends to be a pretty good sequel to the 1980 classic slasher dasher. The big chasing is ridiculous and the end is boring but there are some great moments, the beginning was great. Too much like part 1, but still acceptable."
3,Cool,Surprisingly good sequel to the camp slasher movie has Jason Voorhees the killer and killed the sole survivor of the first then kills many more teens! Bad acting but good chills!
4,one of the best of the series,better than the first. i thought it was fun.other than the acting this is a very good film. if youlike slasher films see this one.
2,All the hype for this...?,"""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is well known by horror/slasher fans to be considered the second best of the series. And I don't know why. I'd say part 6 is. But im not here to talk about part 6, so I guess I'll have to review this. Part 2 begins by killing off probably the nicest ""last girl"" of the series, Alice. On my first viewing, I was dissapointed already. However, Alice is replaced by yet another satisfying ""last gir"", the sassy and smart Ginny; but she still didn't save the rest of the film from being a dissapointment. The whole movie just seems to be missing something; I have no idea WHAT tho. The rather murky atmosphere also made it a tad depressing. And a poor little dog is killed!About the only thing I liked about the whole thing was Ginny. She, and the first appearence of Jason may have helped some in making this installment so popular..."
3,"Friday The 13th, Part 2 - Jason's reign of terror has begun!","This is where the Jason stalking began was in Part 2. A very well wrote sequel is extremely great but looses a star due to the fact of Jason's wardrobe. He's wears something a farmer would wear, not to mention it takes away from because he doesn't have the hockey-mask yet. Good beginning to Jason. The DVD comes with 1:85 Anamorphic Widescreen format, Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, Production Notes, and a Theatrical Trailer. Film contains Language, Violence, Nudity, and Sexual Situations.P.S.-That was a very nice Chevy pickup truck!"
5,Great product,"The DVD arrived on time and in ""like new"" condition. I will order from this seller again."
1,Camp Crystal Lakes gets Sloppy!,"The same plot as the first, only this time the dead kid out in the lake grows to be an adult and goes around killing the teens. No suspense, no scares, a shocking plot. Watching this only proves to be a waste of time."
2,One of the worst of the series.,Jason's first actual outing features him going after a group of counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. This second entry is mostly dull with only the occasional bit of T&A and slasher action to liven things up. Did I mention Jason wears a burlap sack over his head here?
4,Meet Jason for the 1st time!,"This time, Jason Voorhees is actually the killer! But, he doesn't have his classic infamous hockey mask. Instead, he's a hermit/hillbilly with a sack over his head with one eye-hole. For a sequel, it's okay, but it's not the best Friday the 13th!"
3,It's okay,"This is an okay sequal. I'm a guy who's been a fan of friday the 13th movies for a while. With that in mind, the only problems in this film lie in the lack of gore and action. It's better than parts 5 and 9, but still not that great. The highlight of the film is the end chase scene. It's still worth renting and buying though. Plus there's a couple of cute guys."
1,Good if you want to smell like a cigar,"I'm unable to wear this lotion because of the scent, and even my husband asked me to get rid of it. It smells like pipe tobacco. It's nearly as runny as water and comes pouring out of the spout when you pump the nozzle. Nothing like the Escada perfume that I love. Thank goodness seller was willing to refund or replace and was very apologetic."
2,Too Tepid for Decent TV...,"This DVD isn't awful, don't get me wrong. It's just that it seems a bit stuffed with filler rather than promising `outrageous' clips.Most of the good material has been viewed to death anyway by other sources (the internet for example). The kickboxing `break a leg' still makes my eyes water, so do the rodeo moments and the arm wrestle straight from the Cronenberg's The Fly.However, beyond that, there is little else to amaze. Unless you think naked sky diving is `outrageous' then I would suggest you either look elsewhere for clips that are `too hot for TV'.I do not feel you get real value for money. Most of the time, the clips are replayed again and again in slow motion. If you think that repetition is an ideal substitute for substance, then buy it.I bought this on Amazon UK and have tried to sell it THREE times with no success (at a low price).Being fair, I suggest trying to renting it first to see for yourself."
5,SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN!,"ROMANCE AND SUSPENSE INTERTWINED TO DELIVER A HEARTPULSING, HEARTSTOPPING STORY WITH A PLOTLINE LOADED WITH TWISTS AND TURNS. MARVELOUS CHARACTERS YOU LEARN TO LOVE...OR HATE. BRAVO, MS. ANDERSON!"
1,Buyer Beware on this snow thrower,"I went against my better judgement on this. A number of reviewers mentioned having a flat tire out of the box, but others, who obviously had a better experience, recommended this snow thrower. I thought go and ahead and buy it based on the positive reviews. After all what are the chances of getting another snow thrower shipped from Amazon with a flat tire. Guess what: high. One of the tires is completely flat and due to Amazon's return policy I am now stuck following up with the local distributor to seek resolution. At some point if enough people have the same problem Amazon should pull the product.Unless you want the hassle of taking a brand new, unused Yard Machines Snow Blower to the local distributor, do not buy this machine. Unbelievable. Very Disappointed."
5,Great manual pump!,"This pump was recommened to me by a friend when I was still pregnant, so I decided to buy it and give it a try. I had a Gerber battery/electic pump before and was not too happy with it, and I was nervous about switching to a manual pump, but I'm glad I did! I can usually get at least 4 oz. out of each breast in about 20-30 mins. I agree with a previous reviewer about the neck of the pump cracking, but I emailed Avent and they sent me a new part in less than a week! Plus, the pump has the new one piece design which makes it much easier to clean! I love the wide necked bottles and the nipples are not confusing for my exclusively breastfed daughter. She's been using the Avent bottles and nipples since she was less than a week old and we've never had any nipple confusion. I would recommend this pump and this brand of products to anyone! Definately worth the $$!!"
2,Can Be Frustrating,"After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis. At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony. I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber ""petal"" lining. And this pump can be squeeky. The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going. Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position. Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples. I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle."
1,Don't buy anything from Isis from Babies R US !!!!,"I purchased this unit and discovered after opening the small seal, NO REFUND or RETURN. This unit was not suggest to be used for our situation and we needed a motorized unit. So I tried to return the unit at Babies R US, they read me the fine print on the stickers and told me to call ISIS. I have offered to accept exchange for other ISIS product without any sucess.After calling ISIS, they told me to talk to Babies R US. I call and emailed Toy R Us customer service many times and they told me to to call ISIS. What a bunch of no support and pass the buck service.In short, ISIS sales are final and if your not 100% sure you want to try this unit or it will work for your needs, DONT BUY IT!Don't be mislead think a smart consumer that you can return it if you not satisfied!I suggest not buying anyting from both companies now unless 100% necessary."
1,Terribly Disappointing and Frustrating,"I am deeply disappointed with this pump. It squeaks, the pieces come apart when I'm trying to use it, I barely get any suction...pumping two ounces is an ordeal with this pump. Not to mention that my hand gets tired!I bought it because I figured the price was right. Please, if you're going to breastfeed, invest in a GOOD pump. You won't regret it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this pump in a crisis (had left the plug for my Medela Pump 'N Style, a GREAT pump, at home in error) and ran out to buy this. Firstly, I think it is very, very expensive. Secondly, the suction is terrible and the petal massage crap is all bunk. Your baby doesn't massage your breast - why does your pump have to? After spending 45 minutes trying to get this to work, and then another 20 minutes on the phone with Avent, they tried to tell me that it wasn't working because it hadn't been sterilized withy vinegar so wasn't fitting properly. They would not refund my money - what a waste of time and money. I am very disappointed in Avent and the lack of support for their products, and will no longer buy their brand."
4,AMAZING for a manual pump,"I bought this at a cousin's rec as well as the wonderful reviews. I have to say I LOVE IT! I was a Medela user for (solely) pumping for my son for six months. When my daughter was born I wanted something different for travel than by big Medela In-Style. So...I tried it. I am a mass producer so was a little concerned about how much could this help? It's truly amazing! It works BETTER than the medela.Tips for use....1. When using, be sure the plastic disc is secure in the neck and the pliable plastic/rubber disk is securely on the pump head.2. I have found it easier if I lean into the pump when I start to pump and create a good suction.3. When it doesn't start right suctioning right away, I re-latch the pump, lean into it and check the little white disk and the rubber disk on the large head.Great product and I used it 5-7 times a day for almost a week and am now down to 2-3 times a day for two to three weeks."
5,Great Pump for on the go moms!,I love this pump! Every time my husband and I leave the house it comes along with us. I do not like to breastfeed in public and this is perfect to use anywhere! I also use this pump at work. It is small enough to let me sneak off and do my thing. I would highly recomend this pump to anyone.
2,This pump isn't all it's cracked up to be.,"This pump advertises that it's design stimulates let-down, and that is not the case. This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one, and because it's clear, you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump. You'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express."
2,FB,"I thought this would be great when I traveled instead of bringing my electric pump. Boy, was I wrong. Even if you don't intend on pumping that often, I think this was a waste of energy and time. Although electric pumps are expensive, they are more convenient and less stressful on the mother. If you value your time, pass up on the manual pump and get an electrical one. You won't regret it."
4,The original !!,"I just attended a breastfeeding education class and I was surprised to hear that this is one of the very best pumps out there. Our teacher has been a board certified lactation consultant for over 30 years and she claims that this is by far her favorite. She also showed us several different types of pumps and they all seem to imitate the avent model, the only difference was the color and the PRICE ( the rest were a lot more expensive )!I only gave it 4 stars because the true test will be after I use it.....but I am definitely buying!"
3,Not for working mothers!,"This pump is very comfortable just as many of the reviews say, but if you plan on going back to work or school and continuing to pump, DO NOT count on this pump to get you through. Maybe you have an extremely sensitive let down and milk just comes pouring out with very little stimulation and then this pump will work for you or if you only need it for occasional supplemental pumping. I bought this as something small and discreet to use while I'm away at classes during the day and found it is not sufficient. I find myself coming home and spending my study time pumping with my Pump in Style by Medela. I used the Isis and got about 1-2 oz. in a pumping after about a four hour break from nursing and pumping and couldn't get another drop with the Isis. I put the Isis down and started using my PIS and got another 6 oz. with no effort!!! If you plan on nursing long-term and will be away from your baby during the day, invest in a hospital grade pump and save yourself the heartache."
5,Love it! Must have for any nursing mother,"We purchased this a couple of weeks after our daughter was born. We have the nice Medela plug in breast pump - however, it's a pain to travel with and it's pretty bulky.The avent has been great to travel with and really helps if I am ever engorged and just need to pump a little.It is also great because it's not loud, seems to pump effeciently, and also is easy to clean.A must have for any nursing mom!"
1,No Suction!,"I bought this pump for occasional use after my daughter was born so my husband could help out with the feedings at night. I tried to use it but all I got was enough suction to make my nipple move, but not enough to get anything out. Now I will say that when I used the Medela manual pump the hospital sent home with me I have to turn the suction all the way up for my milk to flow. This pump is probably great for most people, but if you have a veracious eater this pump probably isn't for you."
3,"good and confortable, but....","I LIKE THIS PRODUCT IT WAS EASY TO USE AND CLEAN BUT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFULL WITH THE ""neck"" OF THE PUMP I HAD TO CHANGE IT TWICE; SINCE THE PLASTIC IN THE ""neck"" OF THE PUMP IS MADE OF CLEAR PLASTIC IT TENDS TO GET DAMAGE AND EVEN BREAK IT'S LIKE IT GETS TOASTED FROM THE HEAT OF THE STERILIZER OR SOMETHING. BUT I DO ADMIT IT DIDN'T HURT TO PUMP,IT WAS EASY TO CARRY AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF AVENT IN MY AREA WERE VERY NICE, THE PIECE IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE SO I DID KEEP THE PUMP."
2,Got extra money?,"Although very impressed in the beginning with this product, I was very unhappy when the pump broke less than three weeks after I started using it. However, I bought another one since it was still cheaper than the Medela and I had been able to pump eight ounces in about 20 minutes. I tried to be very careful the next time around, but the second time was not the charm and the same part broke yet again. I e-mailed the company, as I read from others who had the same problem that they received great help in getting replacement parts sent to them so quickly. It has been four business days and no response, so second e-mail was sent. If you have the money to keep buying pumps when one breaks, this is the one for you- otherwise you might want to save yourself time and headache and go for the electric"
1,Before You Buy This Pump Please Read,"I purchased this pump because of the great result I had with the bottles. The pump was very disappointing. The suction is not strong enough and you can barely get anything out. I bought The first years pump and it is excellent! I would skip this product all together, it's a big waste of money!! The best years pump cost a few more dollars but it is well worth it. Avents other products are great but this pump is no good, it's a new low for the company that's very heart breaking to me I consider myself to be a loyal avent customer. I couldn't even find any phone numbers or anyway to contact them on their website regarding this product. I am truly displeased I ever spent a penny on this pump."
2,Leaks!!!,The breast cup leaks a lot after 1 month usage. The rubber cup does not create a tight seal. The bottle also leaks around the neck during feeding. Does not seal very tight. Changing nipples does not help.
1,Very Unhappy !!!!! Don't buy this Product!!!!!,"I bought this breastpump thinking it was great! I really wish I would have read the reviews! Esp. the one about the neck cracking and breaking! My son is now 7 weeks old and my pump has cracked at the neck and broken in 2 places! And I have only used it once every evening!! How can people think this product is wonderful? I wish I would have just shelled out the money for the Madela Electric because that is what I will be doing today!! Do not buy this product! It can become a huge problem if this broke at the work place! The plastic is cheap and faulty! Also, a plastic valve part kept getting sucked through the neck which I would have to take apart and fix and put back together AGAIN & AGAIN!!! It was a nightmare at 4 in the morning!!!! TRUST ME DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Can't believe AVENT puts so much pride in this!!!!"
2,Does not withstand repeated use,"I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November. She said it was a ""good little lightweight pump, and affordable"" --- well, I don't think [$$] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered ""good."" I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all; the rubber guard has become loose and doesn't adhere properly to the breast, and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out. I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out! I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms don't have to waste precious time, money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place. SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DON'T BUY THIS ITEM."
1,Humbug,"What a waste of time & energy! This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me. Before it did, I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky. Buy any Medela pump instead. I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often. Sigh."
3,Go with a Garmin,"When you compare Apples to Apples, the TomTom's menu is harder to navigate, and the device is more likely to get you lost when compared with a similarly priced Garmin. My wife and I each purchased a GPS for eachother last Christmas. I bought her a Garmin StreetPilot, and she bought me the TomTom One. Her Garmin is the one we bring with us on trips, because it's easier to use, and more accurate (both of us agree). Both devices are similarly priced, and for the money you're far better off going with the Garmin."
4,love it,I realy like the tom tom the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i would have prefered a hard copy manual instead of a disc. I like to be able to read it and flip the pages rather than be glued to my computer. Overall it is very simple to use.
2,Battery life is a problem,"I purchased a One XL not quite a year ago. With the exception of the battery, it's great!I use it several times a week and for the last couple of months, it's been hard to maintain a charge. It's at the point now where it won't power up at all and from what I've read, this unit has battery issues.I have no idea how pervasive battery issues are with this particular unit or TomTom in general but it seems to me that I've not used it more than average and for the battery to die after 9 months, is a problem. I am planning on purchasing a replacement battery but based on this expereince, I would hesitate to purcahse another TomTom unit."
4,TomTom One XL review,"For a Brazilian, a GPS like this is a must, driving in the USA. Except for an afternoon in Atlanta, where it put me in a loop, making turns between I-75 and I-85, it guided me safely during four weeks. It is really a big help."
5,Tom Tom One XL,"[[ASIN:B000PCBVA6 TomTom ONE XL Portable Extra-wide Screen GPS Navigation System]Excellent navigational device. Would recommend to anyone traveling by car or foot. Prevents unecessary disagreements when trying to locate destination. Excellent resource for locating ""points of interest"". Would highly recommend it's purchase before next trip.!"
4,Tom Tom is pretty good,"I like my Tom Tom and it has helped a lot when I traveled. I had to get used to what it means when it says ""Right turn ahead"". That means what it says, not necessarly the next right turn. You can view the map and see where the turn is. I would like to have street names announced as in ""turn right on to Mary Street"" and a sound at the Mary Street turn to tell me this is the correct place. Other than that, we are enjoying Tom Tom. The large screen helps a bit and we have tried a couple of the different languages just for fun."
4,Love the widescreen,I've used the TomTom ONE before I used the ONE XL and its a great improvement. I really like all the features that the ONE has but the widescreen is cool because you can fit more map on this unit but its still just as thin as the original ONE.
1,Very poor battery! Poor support!,"I've had my TomTom One XL for about 18 months. When turned off, the battery will drain within 2 days. Support says that this is normal as the battery must maintain settings. A really poor excuse. A PC internal battery will maintain settings for up to 10 years. On top of the battery draining, the unit will not operate on external power until the battery has a minimal charge and is reset. This means that you cannot use the unit for about an hour after putting on external power. Really great technology here.On top of that, new maps came out about 6 months after I purchased the unit. Had I purchased the new maps, I would have paid full price. I was not offered a discount. I also submitted map corrections over a year ago and these have not appeared. Really great support here.I cannot in good conscience recommend this product. There are too many other good products available.TomTom, please return your product to Europe. It doesn't fly here."
5,This GPS is better than a bag of diamonds,"Fantastic! Customizable! Never get lost again! What are you waiting for???I have tried both the 4.3 inch and a 3.5 inch TomTom (called XL and version 3 respectively)I paid $150 for the small TomTom and am ecstatic with it.You can download software off the TomTom website to update your maps and add POI (points of interest) - I downloaded all the lighthouses as I am on the East coast and like to photograph them, but you can add whatever you like, stores, strip clubs, churches, state and national parks, whatever you are into they have the locations all to download on their website.Fantastic!I give the TomTom an A+"
4,A good GPS,Have not had the tomtom one xl long but works great all but the cell phone connection is not compatible with verizon wireless bluetooth.
2,IT HAS ITS OWN MIND,"ALTHOUGH IT WORKS WELL IT TURNS IT SELF ON BY ITSELF, NOT ME. THIS IS WHAT DRAINS THE BATTERY. AFTER MANY RESETS AND FIXES WITH NO SUCCESS I WILL JUNK IT.I WOULD NOT SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. BECAUSE IT WORKS WELL WHEN CHARGED I COULD NOT GIVE IT NO STARS. BOUGHT A GARMIN."
3,navigation,"I receive this tomtom GPS navigation and was very happy, having being told that tomtom is the best,however I dont likev the fact that it only says make a right or left in a certain number of miles. I would prefer if it call the street names."
2,Tomtom XL,"We got a Tomtom XL for Christmas. It was fine for a couple of months, and then we started having trouble with the ""Easyport"" windshield mount not sticking -- and still have this problem. It might stick once out of a dozen tries, even though it worked OK for the first couple of months. The mount is also very awkward to use -- it has a large stiff knob that has to be turned while holding the mount on the windshield. If you want to use a windshield mount, choose something other than a Tomtom Easyport. Also, in comparison to the Garmin Nuvi we had previously, the Tomtom is very difficult to program addresses, and is relatively unintuitive to operate in general. But the Garmin died when we tried to upgrade it (bricked it), so they have problems too. We'll try some other brands and see if anyone has something out there that actually works well."
1,Not what I ordered,"I'm sorry but this is not what we ordered. We wanted a bluetooth Gps and it was worded that way but when this came it worked fine except for there was nothing to connect with my cell phone. The law in N.J. states no cell phonesm,and unless we use ""handsfree"", we would be in danger of getting a ticket, if caught talking on a cell phone.We found out we would need to subscribe for the added luxury, which would cost a monthly fee, so we returned the item and look for some other GPS."
4,Mostly Great,"The device is nice in that it has several features, places of interest, plus the large screen at a great price. The one thing however, it sometimes doesn't use the shortest routes, even if you tell it to recalculate using different routes. It seemed to always want you to drive to the nearest highway, rather than taking side roads."
5,TomTom one XL,"TomTom is working great. It is easy to use,considering I am over 65,and easy to read.I recommend it to any one who travels a lot."
2,Not the best GPS,"The directions are quite accurate, but the screen freezes when you go through tunnels. Sometimes, it will stay that way without any signal for upto 30 minutes. I called customer service to resolve this issue and they were less than helpful, so I returned it."
5,Easy to Use,very easy to use. touch screen. The only thing is it does not tell you the street name you are to turn on. It just says make right or make left turn.I got it when it was deal of the day at $ 99.00. If I had to pay full price (over $200.00) I would recommend the Garmin 660. which I have. It has the same features but tells you the name of the street to turn on.
1,Do not update the US map,"Do not update the US map using the software provided by the company. If you do so, you are stuck to Guam map!!! I cannot believe that they have this type of problem in the software. You cannot switch back to the US map again from the GPS. Complete waste of time. If you do not update, everything works fine."
2,You get what you pay for,"I now realize just how young this technology is. This was my first purchase of a GPS Nav device and I am not impressed. It doesn't recognize some logical routes to locations and the ETA is always grossly exaggerated. Key function utilization requires navigation through a number of menus. Also, the manipulation of the active screen for such things as panning both in general or for a planned route is not user friendly. It all boils down to: ""you get what you paid for""."
3,Do you know that you should push the start button everytime....?,"Broadly, this product is not too bad.But, it doesn't seem to be user-friendly.It is really difficult to set into view map option not navigating to somewhere.The worst part is that you have to push the start button.Automatic starting is critical to use navigator in a car.I checked through costumer service. They said it is not available in new units. I didn't hear why. Very Ridiculous"
4,"Good, but not the best","I found Smith's biography of Washington educational, but at times dry. I certainly learned a lot in reference to Washington and the various trials he faced in holding together a fledgling government. However, I also found less enjoyment in this book than in others about Washington's contemporaries. Students of history and particularly government and diplomacy will find this book very informative. It is not however, for the average reader merely looking to become more familar with our first president."
1,Skip the first half of the book,"I found the first part of this book to be very boring, so I quite reading it. Then about a year later someone suggested that I read the book. I equated that I got half way through it and was bored. This fellow suggested that I read the second half as he agreed the first half was boring also. So I read the second half and did not come away with much. I was disappointed!"
4,powerful,"Maybe because it is founded in the actual experience of the writer, reading this book has become experience. Life changing one -without too much noise, just there-: some books are able to transform the reader.I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in knowing beyond the visible in a grounded and realistic way.It becomes a symbol, a resonance: a rare piece nowadays."
2,Not very informative,"I bought this book after seeing an interview with Eric Pearl on Gaiam TV ""Inspirations."" I'm glad I paid only $5 because the book doesn't tell much more than the story he told during the interview.Above all, I bought it to see if this kind of healing is worth a try, but the book doesn't have any proof that it works, so why would I throw away $300.He mentions one study in which the participants could ""feel"" that energy work was being done on them, but that doesn't really mean that it works.I dont know what to make of this, part of me feels like it could be fake, but then why are his seminars so popular?"
5,Amazing!!!,"I've never been inspired to write an Amazon review before until I read this book-I've read a lot of books about healing, but not one has resonated with me like Eric Pearl's book. His easy to read and humorous style is exciting and engaging, and I could actually feel my vibration level rising while reading or even discussing the book. This is a life-changing book everyone can benefit from, and unlike many other books about healing 'techniques' Dr. Pearl isn't condescending, preachy or dogmatic. Reconnective Healing is something everyone can do without ritual or exclusive techniques and he makes a big point of that. I was so inspired by his book that I am flying halfway across the country to see him speak...I can't recommend this book enough! If enough people read this perhaps the consciousness of the world will shift in a posititive direction when we realize we're all connected and all empowered to heal."
4,Geat book but.....,"This book is a great learning tool and you can get going with the Healings but you need to read Matrixenergetics by ""Richard Bartlett"" then you will have the whole concept. It works for me and will work for you, without going to the class."
3,The Reconnection,"The author certainly makes a cogent case for his genre of healing, but it seems to beg more information as to 1) how it actually works and 2) how for the rest of us to get it to work in the first place."
3,Movie Synopsis:,"In the 31st century, scientist Miss Manners (Kelli Summers) has found a way to travel through time. She has also found that her method leads to sexual arousal--she calls it ""lust travel""--and finds herself addicted to the process. Before long Miss Manners is intent on experiencing a sexual experience in every phase of human existence, with the possibility that she'll never make it back to her own time."
4,An Excellent read,The first Clare Francis I have read - and I was not dissapointed! Kept me guessing all the way
3,Works but Not great,"I got this after purchasing a new aftermarket radio for my 2002 camry. It works, but it doesnt really look the best. Putting it together is a pain, its all flimsy plastic but in the end, Looks better than a hole in the dash."
4,BORICUA,THIS PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I WAS HOPING FOR.IT WORKED OUT REAL WELL WITH PROFESSIONAL RESULTS THE DELIVERY WAS AS PROMISED ON TIME WILL BUY MORE PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY IN NEAR FUTURE.
3,A shallow & unremarkable voice,"Echoing an earlier reviewer, one is struck by the fact that Ms. Garrett's voice is an instrument largely lacking in depth & expression. All the notes are in place, more or less, but there is no nuance. She does nothing with music she performs to shape the melody or the lyrics that might imbue it with her own distinct interpretation. While she isn't nearly the joke as some of the ""popera"" acts which seem to be all the rage these days, Ms. Garrett nonetheless leaves us only with the impression of how remarkably unremarkable she is."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality control. While titled as talks regarding Matthew, some were mistakenly from the series on John."
3,"CD 1 moved me, CD 2 was just OK","I'm a fan of Masters At Work. Their productions were a staple of my music arsenal during the House years. I was very happy to see some ""new"" (albeit old material) house mixes. However I was a little disappointed. The Kenny Dope CD (CD 1) is tight. Good selections and good blends. The Louie Vega CD (CD 2) didn't move me as much, mainly due to the selection of tracks. My preference is towards what is now called ""soulful"" house."
4,"wired fine, but couldnt get panel to click into place",Everything wired fine and got my system going good. The only thing is that i couldnt get my panel to click into place. I pushed all the way around and it just doesnt want to. It can stay for a little bit but it eventually just wiggles out of place. If there is any way someone could help me figure out how to click it into play it would really be appreciated. Thanks
4,Good telling of modern English/Irish history,"Independence can be won on the strength of words. Poets and newspapermen as well as politicians and generals lead the fight from Famine to the Eve of Republic.This book traces the lives and interconnections of the important rebellious men and their families through their stands in Ireland against the conditions they saw, and their understanding of the reasons for it; 'transportation' to Australia, escapes, returns to Ireland or settlement in America. Through it all, the keen interest in conditions 'back home', and their attempts to influence it. If you have wanted to understand the relationship between the Irish Diaspora, America, Australia, and Ireland, and the depth of feelings and distrust between the Irish and the English, this is the place to start."
1,Missed the mark,"This book has nothing to do with MS and consisted of very little effort or creative value from Montel. It is merely a short collection of quotes which he considers inspirational, all of which were very cliche and have been used in far too many places. The only one missing was ""Win one for the Gipper"". There was nothing that gave insights into how he has dealt with MS or in ways he could provide inspiration to others who are suffering. I am only glad that the proceeds are going to support MS research or the whole thing would have been a waste of money. I recommend that others simply make a donation directly to the National MS Society instead."
2,a little trite,"I must say that even though I read the earlier review saying that this was just a collection of cliches and to donate your money directly to a foundation, I bought the book anyway. Now I wanted to report - it is indeed a collection of quotes, not even all that inspiring in my mind, and the few stories at the end didn't do much for me. I was very disappointed in this book. I really expected more. Its got more glitz and packaging than content and I definitely wish I had just sent my money directly to an MS charity than have part of the money go to make this book. Its a waste."
3,"good, but not great!","I listen to the CD, it is not quit what I want it: it is actually too much theory. Maybe is just me!"
5,Practical Wisdom for raising great kids!!,"Dr. Leman's humor and common biblical based sense makes this book a great book for mom and dad, educators and ministers. I have also taught the video series with the same name and it is wonderful, everyone enjoyed it. I just wish it was around when my kids were small. They will be getting a copy for their children. With topics like Becoming the parent God wants you to be, reality discipline and let the little buzzards tumble, Dr. Leman is on the top of my recommended list!"
3,packaging not as shown in picture,The picture shows that the eyeliner comes in a tube with a smudge tool at the other end of it. It does NOT have a smudge tool. Very disappointed as I now have to keep my old empty tube and my new one in order to have both tools I need.
4,Help When You Need It,What a great resource! I wish this kind of useful information had been available when I was going through my divorce. The financial information alone would have made the book a great buy.
4,Consummate party album,"This album has not disappointed late night partygoers for over ten years, it just keeps rockin'. The only thing better is catching a live show in Lincoln or Chicago."
5,Spectacular sound track for Bride of Frankenstein,"Don't let the name, The Bride of Frankenstein, make you skeptical about this soundtrack. It remains, along with King Kong, Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane and Vertigo, as one the of best film soundtracks ever composed.Fans of the old Buster Crabbe Flash Gordon series will recognize the music because Bride's soundtrack was recycled for that serial (plus many other films).I remember well one evening at the Hollywood Bowl which featured the L.A. Philharmonic playing the entire soundtrack followed by a standing ovation from the audience. Sample the soundtrack on line and be seduced.Peter Masters"
2,Pretty but flawed,Recieved the watch last month and was impressed with the looks and the fact i could wear it and not worry about it getting wet. My job in a school is very hands on and unfortunately the chrome bezel fell off after only 3 weeks. i now have to find someone to glue it permanently on as the trouble to send it back is too much.
2,Not the greatest,"I stayed with this book, but I struggled to get through it. The point of view (POV)was hard to follow and I kept finding fault with the writing. The narrator writes scenes in first person POV, but they're scenes in which he wasn't present. He goes into detail about some things that don't move the story along, like what people ordered at a restaurant. There's definitely room for improvement where the writing is concerned. This takes away from what could have been a better story."
3,Bruce's voice lost in 5.1DD bitstream,"This DVD is visually great, fast cuts from many camera angles and a general sense of the size of the show. The problem with this DVD is in the audio mix. I run typical 5.1DD in bitstream through a fiber optic cable. In doing so, I have Janick's guitar coming full-blast through the center channel (see other reviews on that issue)and Bruce's voice, in fine form, is banished to a half-volume hell somewhere between the front speakers with the crowd screaming through the rear speakers. The crowd often drowns out Bruce entirely. There is a solution, however. Switching from bitstream to PCM downgrades the surround sound to Dolby Pro-Logic (limiting my amount of adjustable variables, delay etc.) and puts Bruce back to proper level in the center channel. An otherwise classic live performance, albatross withstanding."
4,"Stick to the bass, 'Arry!","The only thing I don't like about this DVD is the choppy editing. You'll think it's great if you've got ADD, but it cuts so much, it's maddening. I don't need to see what Nick's doing while Adrian's taking a solo.Other than that, Maiden's the best in the business, plain and simple."
4,Great Show,"This is a great DVD with really good sound and picture but it doesnt get 5 stars for a coubple of reasons. First the set list. There are too many songs from ""Brave New World"". Now it was a good album and good comeback but I think they should have added more classics like ""Aces High"", ""The Clairvoyant"" or ""Flight of Icarus"". Another problem are the special features. To be honest they are quite boring and they could have been done much better. Overall though if you are an Iron Maiden fan this is definitely worth buying."
2,Maiden Fan,"I love Iron Maiden, however the editing makes this nearly impossible to watch. Epileptic seizures may incure. Just because you have 15 cameras doesn't mean you need to use them all for every song. Too bad you ruined it."
4,I was there...,"This is the better DVD I have, the song is great and the film is wonderful! For me it's not 5 stars because some musics (like Fear of the Dark) were edited!I was there in Rock in Rio (I'm from So Paulo - Brazil) and the live show was at least 98979 stars!!! :-)Sorry for my bad english!"
1,Don't bother,"This is a book about some guys exploits at learning languages. But don't blame the author, this book is written in that unmistakable ""ghost writer"" style. It includes such awe-inspiring topics as flash cards, talk with the natives, and word associations, rudimentary steps every language learner already knows. Maybe, before the internet, this was a useful book but in this day and age my own poor Japanese Language learning skills are leaps beyond his."
4,a bit sexist and outdated but still worth reading,The author focuses mainly on European languages but his tipscan be used to study any language. His advice includes:1) making flashcards2) studying while waiting in line or on the phone3) buying all available audio lessons and rotating through them4) reading real newspapers and magazines is more valuable thanusing the most advanced textbooksIt's not 5 star because he didnt mention the Leitner methodfor flashcards and it's too long-winded in the beginning.
3,It's OK,"When I saw this book at Barnes and Noble, I had to buy it since I was interested in learning languages. At first I loved it because it gave a lot of information about other languages. Since then I realized that the book could've been better. To me the most useful information is the section about parts of speech. The rest of the book is about his life of learning languages. To me this isn't useful. Farber fills the book with a lot of hype about why he learned languages and not enough of HOW he did it. Don't get me wrong. Farber's idea for writing a book like this was a very smart thing to do. I just think it could've been better. For example, he could've gone into greater detail with grammar.After reading some other reviews, I decided to add more to this review. One reviewer says, ""Don't waste your money."" I think that's a little harsh. This book is not a waste of money. It's a very fun book to read. His book inspired me to write mine.Brandon Simpson"
5,hot and safe,This is a great heater for an average size room.I have had mine for two years and never had a problem.I use it in a three season room and it heats the room up in about a half hour.
4,hmmm not as good as the first but still ho++,"the high road, i feel is a good album it deff had it's high points it made me wanna dance made me wanna cry. the high road really shos how much JoJo has grown n2 a lovely yong women. Her voice is amazing...the beats r hott, u gotta buy this album :)fav tracks:this timethe way u doome goodol'like thatexceptionalnote to goD"
2,A little to lame,"I love the songs, a little too late. I think Jojo has a great voice, and will become a great artist over time.I was a little disappointed in this cd, however.I expected there to be a lot of tracks that I would love, but nope. A little too late- while I love the song reminds me of songs on her 1st cd.There is another great song called "" I am coming for you"" track 8.Otherwise, the cd is filled with rap, and r&b; songs that just don't fit her. They're weakly produced and don't show the true range or beauty of her voice. I wish she could find a better temper of music to fit her better as I think she could be great. Again, it's half-baked r&b; that just won't hold up....that's why you don't hear any of the other songs played on the radio. She has more potential that to be just a one hit per cd kind of girl!"
2,The Bad Road of Singing,"Everybody's about to forget about JoJo (Joanna Levesque), and we know why. Too Little Too Late was actually the only number one hit for Billboard Charts from this album. Throughout her own life, ""Breezy"", ""Leave (Get Out)"" and ""Baby It's You"" are probably the only greatly known songs she's successful for. Now that's doing a singing business really poor. Joanna is going to be named, ""Booanna Loseque"" if she does not get her singing to be awesome. If anybody agrees with me, don't buy this album or ignore this message."
5,Why No Grammy Nominations???,"Very Nice album from begining to end! both Hip Hop and R&B make an influence here. From the opening track This Time with its Hip Hop rhythems similar to Eve's ""Let Me Blow Your Mind"" (Same Producer) JoJo Shines on just about every track! The alubms lead single went on to be JoJo's greatest hit! (So Far) The album is highly addicting. The whole last half of the album is full of heartfelt ballads with great power notes similar to Whitney Houston(May She Rest In Peace) I highly recommend this album to anyone with a love for R&B."
2,Very Fun and Easy to Use,Bought it 3 days ago. Did a page and its beautiful. I had no technical difficulties. I was able to print a beautiful scrap page. I just wished it had more photo realistic accents because I like that look in my pages. I will address this to the manufacture and maybe in the updates that they do for free to the software online they will add more
4,Awesome software,"Strengths: This program offers a lot of creative leeway to make all kinds of projects. I can make an endless number of paper dolls for crafts or toys. I can make page layouts for scrapbooks, family history charts, displays, cards, etc.Weakness: There are not very many options for picture borders. Although this is feature more for photo software, it would be nice to have a few more options."
3,"Great Scrapbooking, But Slowwww","I purchased the program to create a digital scrapbook for my son's 1 year birthday. I am not a scrapbooker, but I am very computer literate. The program has allowed me to create some amazing scrap book pages, but .... the program runs very slow. There is a lot of wait time to perform simple functions. I have 1 GIG (Yes, 1 GIG) of memory on my computer, so I know that it is not a hardware issue. I am on on the hunt for faster technology."
2,Thomas and the freight train,This is a nice small book to take along in the car but I don't think the pictures are animated enough. My 19 month old son doesn't seem too interested in the book.
5,Gas Attack,"One of Aarons' best. Sam Durell is loaned to a secret agency even more secret than his own. When several members of a G2 group that cleaned up secret Nazi files are found dead, Sam is found to have a connection to the group. The mission leads to other members of the group searching for some of the missing files. Using the plans to develop a secret weapon leads to an attack on an ultra secret government facility.One of the hallmarks of the Durell series was Sam finding people from his past involved in the case. This one is the first to use that plot device in Angelina, an old girlfriend of Sam's from the bayou country."
5,Spiritually moving and musicly genius!,"Supernatural is a great example of the diverse musical talents of dc Talk. I've been a fan of dc Talk for a long time, I loved the hip hop style of Free at Last, and the more Rockish Style of Jesus Freak. But Supernatural has both Rock and hip hop on top of dc Talk's own individual style. this is a must have album. God Bless!"
1,139 body count--some appear to be the same,"After Romero's ""Dead--movies"" as well as ""Dead Alive"" and ""Bad Taste"" this movie is rotten.No real plot,and no characters with any depth.The director calls it art.This is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it's really good.We are told that there are 139 deaths, but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.Comic Books do better than this.I guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.The most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman's mouth.This mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.Italians seem to do better with crappy gore than Germans."
5,"Perfect, the album is everything music should be.","If this album does not move you, not only do you have a hole in your soul, but your head as well. Everything a young american needs. All the musicians and volcalists are the best that american culture has evolved into. Not even the aliens from outerspace could come up with or duplicate this music. Every human emotion and situation is exemplified through this music. This album is a tribute to Eddie Taylor by his son, Edward Taylor, family members and other musicians who played with Eddie Taylor. Everything is perfect, turn the music up loud and enjoy. Nobody outshines each other, the music is a concerted effort to pay tribute to a Great Blues Legend.In a perfect world albums like this would be the norm and sell millions and millions of copies, we have alot of work to do. Buy this album and save the human race. This review by Olen Perkins"
2,Mortise & Tenon?,"3 things bothered me about this table. One, a shipping company called Eagle brought the package later and for 4 times what UPS charged for 2 other Strathwood packages that were even larger than the table. Two, I make furniture now and then; their definition of mortise and tenon joinery is in need of updating- this table lacks mortises and tenons completely. It is screwed and bolted together like other cheap tables. Three, Strathwood, or their distributor, sent two wrong items in place of the items I chose. Caveat emptor."
2,Stain stains,"I acknowledge that it's a cheap way of getting the ""teak"" look but, it might just be too cheap. During the first rain, the table's stain ran all over our stone patio. I can't appreciate outdoor furniture that can't take the outdoors!"
1,Incompatible with certain networks,"I purchased this router to serve a home network that contains both Macs and PCs. It replaced an Apple Time Capsule because I wanted QoS functions.However, when I installed the 655, the Windows 7 machine could no longer connect to my iMac via SMB sharing. It would just return vague errors. When I swapped back to the Time Capsule, the errors went away and everything functioned normally. I spent over two hours with a Level 3 technician from D-Link trying to resolve the problem, and eventually, after trying everything in his arsenal, we give up.Additionally, I would experience random connectivity problems with my MacBook Air, though the ipad and iphones seem to never experience issues.At any rate, I returned the unit to Amazon and will be trying something else."
2,Unreliable signal,"This router does not produce a reliable signal, once a day it has to be unplugged and plugged back in which never happened with my old router using the same ISP. If you try calling tech support (which I don't recommend) you'll likely be on the phone for hours as they ask many unrelated questions before you can even get to telling them the problem. You of course can't use this with a VPN either b/c of the unreliability it causes lots of problems. I agree with other reviews that the lights are very bright and annoying."
5,Simply marvelous!,"It doesn't get much better than when a complete wireless novice, such as myself, plugs this device in-line between the cable modem and my desktop PC (just using the ""quick setup"" instructions) and within 5-10 minutes have a solid connection to my new HP Pavilion laptop. It's been working flawlessly for 3 months now and no sign of signal loss anywhere in the house. Highly recommended!"
2,Doesn't work well with Windows 7,"I use Windows 7 Home Edision 64 bit. After lots of effort, the connection is still on and off. Besides, the company technical support has little help."
1,ID-Link is a D-Ddont,"I bought this router to replace a Belkin Basic unit that was too slow and had limited range. Out of the box, it looked great, but that's where my enthusiasm ended. This is one of the most difficult and tedious units to configure. I had nothing but problems trying to set this unit up. After two days of trying, I finally was able to connect only one laptop to it but the connection was very intermittent and frustratingly slow. My attempts to connect to other devices failed. Needless to say I was very disappointed with it and quickly re-packaged it and sent it back. Dont waste your time on this."
1,do not buy,"We have tried repeatedly to setup this router as per instructions, but it just does not work.Possibly defective. Will try to return."
1,Don't buy this!,"I replaced an Airlink 101 (has 2 antenas) w/ this router. My Airlink got much, much better signal & it was $30 something compared to $70 something for this. Now it's too late to send back & stuck w/ this junk. Amazon is awsome, of course. Just the product that is junk."
2,DONT GET THIS ROUTER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SIGNAL RANGE!!!!,"My modem is pretty far from my bedroom, so I get very weak WIFI signals with my 4-year-old, 40 dollar Netgear Wireless G router. So I wanted a replacement to extend/stabilize the signal in my bedroom. I read a lot of reviews of top single band wireless N router, and this one seems to be the top choice. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE CASE! After setting up this router, I lost the signal in my bedroom completely!!! You can imagine the disappointment. A 40 dollar Netgear G router from 4 years ago, out-range this supposedly the best single band N router in the current market. In the end I hooked my Old Netgear back, and used this router as a WIFI extender, took a while to figure out the setup. This is my 2nd D-link router, and this would be my last for sure.DON'T GET THIS ROUTER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SIGNAL RANGE!!!!Just go with Netgear or Linksys(Cisco). They are more reliable."
1,Tech support suck!,"The setup following the instructions that came within the CD never worked. The personnel in tech support need support. Yea, it suck! The phone communication with them is awful; in addition it is quite obvious they are not well prepared to deal with this matter. After going in circles for 1 hour, the tech support just gave up saying that probably my computer was too old (in reality my pc is just 2 years old). I ended putting back my old linksys router. Please, stay away from D-link."
4,"Great with New, Bad with Old","I've got a fairly decent sized network with wired PCs, Consoles, NAS, and wireless laptops. I was able to connect immediately to the internet through AT&T DSL despite other reviewers' problems. Mine worked out of the box. It took a while to go through all the settings, but setup was fairly easy. The only real problem I have now is that the wireless for the laptops (only .11b right now- I haven't gotten new adapters) is worse with this new router versus the one built into the DSL Modem. The signal is weaker and constantly drops even though it's in the same place as the old router. So, I enabled B&G on the old router, and N on the new one for when I get a new adapter or laptop. The consoles have wireless G, but I prefer to hardwire them to stream from the NAS, so I'm not sure if anyone will have problems with G. Overall, a decent device- Gig Ethernet is great and there's plenty of features; just disappointed with the wireless B."
1,Received two DIR-655 DOA,"I ordered the DIR-655 based on the positive reviews it received on Amazon. I have received two units from Amazon and both have been dead on arrival. I spent about 20 minutes on each unit working with D-Link tech support. I found it interesting that the two technicians tried totally different solutions. Regardless, they could not get a TCPIP Ping to work so they declared my units defective. This was my first and last D-Link purchase. Back to Linksys."
2,Not Good,Ran into numerous problems1.) Internet speed was 1/22.) Could not manually configure the DHCP IP address3.) At automatic kept losing the connection4.) The Wireless connection was fast range was good
2,Worked intermittently,Was hoping that buying a refubished router would be ok but was totally wrong. First we had to reset the router to factory settings to even get it working. Then when it was set up it dropped the signal several times a day. I returned this one and bought a Lyksys Cisco router that works great and very reliable.I wouldn't suggest wasting your time.Very irritated.
2,It's Ok,"Loved it when I first got it than started having random issues. Wireless is fine, QoS doesn't seem to work one way or the other. Had DNS issues, issues with Roku and issues with speed (Comcast ISP). Ok, for most basic users and also have slower Internet, would recommend something else; though this might work as a good AP only."
1,Do not buy this. Please look elsewhere,"This worked for a while. Then all its settings 'locked up'. I could not modify MAC addresses, change encryption or anything. I had my admin name / pass, and the admin panel confirmed all changes, but 1 minute later everything would revert.The router was bricked and had to be thrown away. $100 for 6 months work :("
1,You pay DLINK to return defective item,Got this item today. After hours with DLINK tech support they told me it was a defective item and to send it back for a replacement. When I went to get an RMA number they told me I have to pay return shipping.I sent it to Amazon for a refund with no charge for shipping.DLINK stinks.
3,Solid for casual consumers,"This router would of received more stars in my book if I actually was able to keep it. Unfortunately I had to return it, but not because it's not a solid router. The main and only reason I had to return it is because it cannot sustain my VPN connection. It drops my VPN connection if I idle for 4 minutes and even the latest firmware (1.32NA) does not fix it. Don't buy this router if you need to VPN into work!Other than that, the router was solid and have plenty of features. Some options in the web interface may be a bit confusing to look at."
1,Very unreliable.,I have to continuously reset this router so that my wired devices will be recognized by my wireless laptop. My $40 NetGear wireless router never had a problem; this thing is grossly overpriced for the quality & reliability.
3,Would try another brand next time.,"Had some compatibility issues. Hard to find answers, instuctions & help just ran me in circles with no quick fix."
3,Nothing Special,"The wireless portion of the router just gave out after two years of below average use. Overall, it was a good router, when it was working. I am not a very heavy user of wireless networking. Used the router for basic office connectivity and surfing the web and streaming video to multiple devices simultaneously. I do not know what the longevity of a router is suppose to be but I would have thought more than 2 years. For example, my cable modem is about 8 years old and still going strong. Lastly, the LED lights on the router are quite bright. Thus, I do not think that it can be kept in a bedroom unless the lights are covered."
1,Never D-Link,"Okay this router might be fast, but that is when it works. This is our second d-link router, we bout this one to replace our older d-link which had many issues. This one is no better. Disconnected weekly at first, then daily, now we sent it to get it refunded for now-a-days it disconnects 4-5 times a day min. There been times it'd disconnect 10 times in less then 10 mins. I HIGHLY suggest you not to buy it."
2,I was looking for a gig router and saw this one. Price seemed to be right. But it is not supported by d-link anymore,I was looking for a gig router and saw this one. Price seemed to be right. But it is not supported by d-link anymore per their customer service. It did not work for me. Especially the wi-fi. I would not recommend it.
1,Very poor range,"I've had this router for a few years and the range has always been poor. I can put the laptop on top of the router and it still says I only have 70% signal. Walk ten fee away to the other side of the room and it's down to 50%. The transmit power is set to ""High"" and I'm running the latest firmware available.I had to purchase the range extender just to get any decent coverage at all and it did not help much but at least we can use laptops in the family room againI can not recommend this router."
1,D-link disappointing cheaply made/tested products lately,"This router was ordered to replace one that arrived DOA out of box (a disappointment in itself). Followed all steps to install (again) and guess what - powers up but fails to see my modem (roadrunner). Calls to tech support were answered ""all techs are busy call back later"" and line disconnects. D-link is putting out some real junk lately. Another example of there being cheap, the power cord on this is like 1' shorter (presuming to save a penny in costs), they are slowly turning what was good product into junk!"
1,Don't use with XP Pro (32 bit),"Never have I written a review on a product (good or bad) until now. Router loses connectivity with cable modem (direct connect to cable modem from computer all is fine) every 1 to 3 days. Multiple calls and e mails to tech support have not resolved, trying to get refund but I suspect I bought a paperweight. Had to upgrade the Firware which wasn't were tech support said it was. Each tech call has same response of manually reconfiguring the router which gets old after the 12th time. XP Pro will not support WPA, only WEP so real need to buy this anyway as throughput speeds will not increase. Go with Cisco and don't look back."
1,Save your money,"Lots of bells and whistles and worked great for about 6 months. Now it has lots of issues - every few minutes it drops all connections. Also frequently reboots and is just generally unreliable. It was great for a while, but now I'm back on Amazon to buy another one 'cuz I can't stand dealing with this thing anymore!"
2,Not what I'd hoped for,I purchased this router to replace a Belkin N+ which had drop out issues. This D-Link worked fine for a couple of months and now it too has developed drop outs. I have to reboot it about once a week and a couple of times I had to reboot it multiple times in order to get it functioning. The router has great features and a fair range but I need uninterrupted service. Another thing I dislike about this router is that I have not been able to control it remotely. I travel some and have network cameras using the router but I can not access it remotely to make changes; this is not a deal breaker but it would be nice.
2,Good Idea But Not Fuly Functional,"I have purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router which is capable of 4 hardwired connections to it as well as wireless connections. The setup was painless and my connections (wired and wireless) are working.HOWEVER the SharePort never has never worked even using the shipped software. I tried using different versions of the software but still I could not get it working. So if you are looking to share a printer or storage device, this is not the router for you.This is no more than a plain vanilla wireless router with 4 wired ports. I am very disappointed with it and would advise looking elsewhere if you want to hang a printer or a storage device off your router."
1,I hate this router,Ive had this router for over 2 years and its always messing up my modem and wifi. I have to reset it about 5 times before it will start working again. Im buying an Airport Extreme to replace this with.
1,Stay Away,"This router does not support any filtering options other than your typical aes security. No web filtering works, even dlink can't get it to work. Also don't get any more than 20 ip addresses using at any given time or it will crash. Been using this at home and overseas for a couple years now. It is very frustrating and isn't compatible with dd-wrt."
2,Not worth the money if not using N mode,"I bought this router a few months ok wanting to upgrade from the basic Linksys wireless router. I thought I would be able to get N mode working but found out that no game consoles use it and you need the N adapter which costs just as much as the router so I couldn't use that mode for any of my computers. After connecting it, and optimizing it to the best performance I could get working which was just the next one under Extreme N mode, I got the same results as the Linksys router. No difference what so ever. So I resorted to just going wired.To make your computer N compatible, it will cost you close to $200 for the adapter and this router. So unless you want to spend the money for it, go for it, it will be better but its only limited to whats N mode ready. If you're not gonna use N mode, then skip this and just go with the Linksys wirless basic router. You'll get the same performance. This router is not worth the money if you're not already N compatible."
3,limited mac filtering and static ip reservation,"I currently have the DIR-655. Using MAC address filtering, and with it being turned ON, I can only input a maximum of 24 wired/wireless MAC addresses, to allow access to the router (for security purposes). I have more wired and wirelesss devices (+ friends' and guest's devices) than the DIR-655 could handle. Also, the DHCP reservation list is maxed out to 21 IP addresses. It could probably handle (not sure about this) more MAC addresses if the MAC address filtering is turned OFF, and more IP addresses if set to Dynamic DHCP. There hasn't been any firmware upgrade to handle this shortcoming. DIR-855 has this same shortcoming, and am not upgrading to it. I will look for another brand that does not have these limitations."
3,needed help,"This router was recommended by our computer ""help"" guy. I found and excellent price, and received it in 3 days. Our ""help"" guy had to assist in the set up, putting a security link on it and removing the ""magic"" software."
1,SLOWEST ROUTER EVER!!!,"After reading all the good review I was convienced that it is worth $69.99. The description says ""14X faster speed""Hell NO!!! This roughter is slow. I dont recommend this model. I had Dlink rougter in the past and I've paid much less than this and that roughter was fast. This one is slow for me.I dont really care how much I paid for, but what really pissed me off the most about DLINK product is their tech support. They are the most unprofessionl, unhelpull, and the most stupid tech support ever. I believe most of them are located in the Philippines. I've called them three times before I've got my wireless roughter set up and I had to yell, and treaten to get the last tech support I spoked with, fired!. I felt at that time it was the only way I can get them to help me out. I had to go to that drastic measure to get the help that I needed and that is not good. So, one star for DLINK roughter and zero for their tech support. Thank you."
4,Good wifi range.,I got this to replace and older 802.11g and I'd estimate that my wifi range nearly doubled. Really love it!
5,Very good router,"This is the 4th router I've owned (2 Linksys & 2 D-Link) and am very pleased with it. It is extremely customizable with the ability to fine tune the firewall very carefully.What impressed me the most was the improvement in wireless signal strength over my previous D-link DI-624 router, at least a two bar improvement in all areas of my home.The included setup disk is helpful especially for people who've never setup a router before."
2,Only made it 2 years,Got kicked off a lot. Had to call customer service to update it within a year. Took forever. Look elsewhere. Not recommended.
4,Good router,"I have always used DLink Router. Started with DI-624, then DIR 615 and the DIR-655 after the older units exhibited problems that it's not worth repairing. It served mePROS:-Setup was really easy; prior knowledge from previous dlink routers enabled me to get this unit firing in less then 30 minutes-Good signal strength-reliable-features rich-Gigabit routerCONS:-complicated and there are many features that i may need to do more reading to use"
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this product yesterday and it was supposed to install in 10 minutes but it took over three hours calling the tech support and talking with someone who could hardly speak English!. I am very dissatisfied with this product because instead of automatically being installed I had to change all the IP Address, Sub Net etc manually. I think a $20 router would do better. I also had an older version of D-Link that stopped working within 6 months. So I am all done with D-Link and would never even look at their products."
2,Works great until someone turns on that microwave oven,"Works pretty good until you or your neighbor get that microwave oven going, then signal's gone even if the router is within 10 feet from you. I would've expected N bandwidth to work better than that."
5,Good Product,"After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant in ordering this product, but it works great!!! I have gone from a Belkin (which my iPhone will never automatically pick up) to this unit. Great range, I have 4 iPhones and an Ipad and they always choose my signal first (unlike with the belkin) I also have 2 Google boxes and I'm very pleased with the HD streaming. The lites are bright, but I don't sleep in my office and the unit does NOT overheat."
5,Never More Disconnected,"Since I bought this wireless router I have never ever more experienced sudden disconnections. I am truly happy with it.The set up is easy but is better if you know a little of the stuff of instalation, since you will get better performance of your dlink router.Do not hesitate, go and get it!"
5,Excellent router,"This thing is fantastic. Lightning fast, utterly reliable, just rock solid. I love it so much I'd marry it if the state of Virginia would allow it.Set up was a pain, and I did have to call tech support. I was on hold for 10 minutes, then got told it was another 20 minutes to talk to someone or they could call me back. Frustration level was at a 10. Call me back, I said. Well, they did. I was on the phone changing settings and typing in this and that for 10 minutes, and then it all worked. Tech support did a great job.This thing never drops a signal, works all over the house, and is lightning fast. I'm very happy. Best $72 I've spent in a good long while.BTW, no issues with over-heating or anything like that, but it is in a basement that stays around 62 degrees."
2,I reboot this router daily to maintain reliability,"I've had this router for about a year and a half. Early on, it would randomly lock up such that attached computers would not have access to the internet, and external computers couldn't access the router. I would manually reboot the router which would resolve the issue 100% of the time. This would happen about once a month for about a year. About 6 months ago it started occurring more frequently, about once a week.This became very intolerable as I have inbound functionality as well. Until I decide to buy a new router, I put in one of those very cheap power timers and turn power off to the router for 15 minutes every night to effectively reboot it.I think there are random hardware issues with this router. That in combined with the reported D-Link customer service experience, makes this a hard buy.I'll be looking for a better more reliable router."
1,"There are better routers than this, weak signal","I have been using a Cisco-Linksys WRT54G wireless router with fairly good success. It is in the basement of an 1800 SqFt house. The router is 7 yrs old and figured while upgrading a completed home theater system maybe it was time to upgrade the wireless router. D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router signal strength was no more than half the linksys signal. Also, connections were lost in rooms upstairs directly above the router. I re-installed the Linksys and not one connection has been dropped for over a month now. This DLink router was a waste of $80. Maybe Ebay will help me recover half."
1,"Bad unit, bad customer support","There was a problem with set up...I called Customer Service and spent 10 minutes with a guy trying to give me ""free"" stuff for $11.95 cause I was the 100th caller. I kept asking if this was D-Link's customer service and was assured that it was. I kept saying I didn't want the ""free"" stuff, just answers to a set up problem and he kept telling me he would get to it as soon as his computer booted the info and then continued to try to get me to take the ""free"" stuff. After hanging up I called back and got the same...""congratulations, you're the 100th caller, etc."" Finally just returned the router to D-Link."
1,Don't buy this router!!!,Don't buy this router. It's very unstable and offer poor performances. After a week I can't figure what the problem is. My Blu-Ray player can see the network and the day after it can't. Files transfer can take hours. I think I will throw it in the garbage and go purchase an other brand at Best Buy!
3,Great While it was Still Working,"The Set up was relatively easy. Seemed pretty fast as well, but it died the week after the warranty expired, Plus to call for Tech Support you have to pay a fee after 1 year. Pretty frustrating. I've heard these are usually pretty reliable, guess I got a Lemon and no help from D-Link"
1,Terrible Product,"Easy to setup. However, the router would only work for a few hours at a time before requiring a power cycle to get it working again. Tried reconfiguration, nothing helped.I was hoping for better range performance than the Linksys router that I currently have. No!! During the short working durations, the range was no better at all.Fortunately Amazon processed my refund quickly. That was about the only positive thing I can say about this purchase."
1,Very Difficult,Got this off of a recommendation and had trouble with it from the beginning. Had to reset it at least once a day and I couldn't print wirelessly. Bad customer service as well. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
3,Satisfactory until it stopped working,"When I first set this router up it was great, pretty straight forward set-up. At first it provided awesome speed, great range. However later onwards, connection would cut out and reconnect every so often. Annoying when you are streaming something. Eventually the wireless just stopped working. Although it still worked through hardwire I was unable to see or ping the router meaning it was only acting as a switch. After ~45minutes on the phone with D-Link technicians, which included being transfered 4-5 times and explaining your situation that many times they were able to deem my router defective. My router was still covered under warranty so I selected the option they would send me a new router as I send the defective one back. The only thing that I didn't like is that they made me pay for the shipping on the unit back to them. Usually electronics companies pay for shipping both ways for defective products. I still have yet to receive the replacement router."
2,Not for highly populated apartment,"Never had an issue with this item at my old apartment - probably was about 5-10 routers in the area.Once I moved to a large city, the apartment complex I moved into had about 20 routers showing up on my macbook pro.Every 30-45 minutes I lost connection or the connection would time out.Adjusted a ton of settings to see if I could get a change (I work in IT so I knowledgeable on what I was changing) but to no avail.Recommendation: Great for a house or smaller apartment complex. Great speeds when it worked.If you live in an apartment - get a router that has a Dual Band feature and only run your wireless off of the 5 ghz band.A lot of things such as garages, baby monitors etc... run on the 2.4 ghz band and could cause interference, as well as other routers."
1,Dlink 655 is a piece of junk,When I read the reviews for this router I saw a lot of pretty good comments. What I didn't notice was an equal amount of negative comments. I believe that dlink is spamming the reviews to keep them positive. I have had nothing but trouble with this thing. When I try to stream music or videos it is constantly freezing. I wish I had bought it local so I could return it with out all the hassle.
2,N doesn't work with Vista,"Advertised to work with Vista, but only works wired, or in G mode. Only G works in Vista-32 or Vista-64. Technical service gave up after 2 days on the phones with them."
1,Powerful enough to cover a room.,"Pros:1. According a website that monitors network equipment evaluations, 14 of 16 lab reports gave it their highest rating for wireless routers. For this reason, it is the ""top dog.""2. The California based tech department was very knowledgeable. The Filipino woman really ""knew her stuff.""3. The $100 price is very reasonable.Cons:1. The wireless waves failed to penetrate through two wall and a floor. After working for two minutes, the strength dropped to 25% and below. As a result, it was useless."
1,The newest firmware version 1.31 is a nightmare,"I purchased the router one and a half months ago. After upgrading the firmware, the router is very unreliable. The port forwarding sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. My KylinTV connection is buffering all the times. And now it has difficulty to obtain an IP from my ISP, while my computer can obtain one easily when connected directly to the cable modem. I hope I could return it now."
1,Stay away from firmware updates,"All firmware updates from v1.21 have caused problems with port forwarding, signal loss, and freeze ups. D-Link has been slow to repsond to the issue. If you don't believe me, go to the D-Link forums and see what users are saying about it."
3,"Excellent wired, but wireless keeping going dead.","I have owned two DIR-655. The first one (HW RevA) worked perfectly, great range, and stable and fast connection. When I changed my internet service provider, and it came with a wireless cable modem, I happily sent the DIR-655 to parent's house and set them up for a stable wireless coverage. After a while, as I found the wireless router in the cable modem is not as good as my old DIR655, I bought my second DIR655 (HW RevB). It performs as well as the first when it does work, but the wireless part will die at least once a day. When the wireless dies, it really dies. You can't find its SSID anywhere and requires a power recycle to bring it back up. It is really annoying."
2,Range on this router sucks,"I replaced my Belkin pre-N with this router, it was easy to set up and throughput is terrific. BUT the wireless range is terrible! With my Belkin pre-n I could go to the end of my driveway, which is over 300' before I lost signal, in my house I always had full bars. When I replaced it with the dlink I could not get a signal in the far end of my house where the bedroom is, plus my iphone could not connect even on the deck! I resolved the issue by installing my old Belkin pre-n as a access point and now I have the best of both, good throughput with the dlink and great wireless with the Belkin!! Now only if I had both in one unit......"
5,Easy,"I just bought my first laptop and did a lot of research to select a router. This one seems to fit the bill for a firstimer, easy to setup and so far runs great."
1,Don't buy this router,"This is my first review on Amazon, although I have made many purchases. I am so disgusted with this router and the dlink support that I just had to warn others not to purchase this product. Router worked fine for about 1 month, and then quit. It loses the signal and then reboots constantly. Contacted dlink support and they are no help whatsoever. Finally was given return authorization, but I honestly do not want another router with problems. Search the internet and you will find many complaints about this router. Wish I had before I made this purchase."
1,Please stop selling this router,"Dear D-Link,Please stop manufacturing this router. For the last 18 months, I have struggled keeping an internet connection active for more than two days straight. In reviewing your user forums, it appears that many others have had similar struggles. I've held on, hoping that a magic firmware update would be issued that would make all of the issues disappear. Hasn't happened yet. I just bought a Linksys router to replace the DIR-655. It's working great, it was easy to set up, and I feel good about abandoning the D-Link product line."
3,Goes out DAILY,Everyday this router stops functioning for some reason. I have to pull the power cord and wait for it to reset.Avoid this one!
1,Wish it would have worked.,"I spent almost an entire day attempting to setup the router. I'm no slouch when it comes to networking or computers but no matter what I attempted, could not get the router to broadcast a signal. Wired it worked perfectly but after several frustrating hours I gave up. I have hooked up my old Linksys router and will continue to keep my eyes open for a good deal for a quality product."
5,A great buy,Bought this with along with a Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem. Never have any problems! A great router and easy to use. Highly recommend.
3,Great for everything but Apple TV,"The DIR-655 router worked great with my PC and iMac, but wireless just wouldn't stay connected to my Apple TV device (first generation). Tried a variety of settings after hours of investigation on many Apple and D-Link forums but no luck, would get intermittent wireless disconnects almost daily. Really wanted to keep this router but re-setting up the ATV wireless connection everyday was not very convenient. Ended up re-connecting my old (D-Link)router and sent this one back to Amazon. Will now try a Netgear product. Would not recommend the DIR-655 for those who have a first gen ATV on their wireless networks."
1,Needs to be renamed F-link because it fails,"2 months into it and its dropping the internet connection on the wired ports, have to remove power to boot router to get momentary connection back so I could write this review and find a new reliable Netgear router to replace the DIG-655 F-Link/No-link router"
1,Leave it in the box. Buy a Linksys instead.,Could not get a connection to last for more then 5 minutes. Bad receiption. Bad unit.
5,"Works with Tivo, Wii (and PCs)","I ordered this because my old router was dying. I have an older Tivo, which runs only 802.11B and a Ninetndo Wii (802.11G) in addition to two standard PC wireless connections (and a couple of wired ones). I had to dial back the wireless security in order to bring my Tivo along, which locked the router into only B/G function, but the signal strength is great and there have been no ""legacy"" issues at all. Color me quite happy."
5,Awesome,this router is fantastic. i recommended it to a friend a mine and he was happy too. the blue lights look cool as its running in a dark room. once i setup all the features for the best wifi speed i was barely losing 5mbps
5,LO RECOMIENDO 100 POR 100 EXCELENTE EQUIPO MUY BUENA SEÑAL Y TREMENDO ALCANCE.,ES UNA DE LAS MEJORES ROUTER QUE E ADQUIRIDO. TIENE MUY BUENA SEÑAL Y EL ALCANCE ES INIGUALABLE. FACIL DE INSTALAR Y CONFIGURAR.
3,Seems OK,"I've only had it for a short time, but it seems to be working OK...Has an instlal wizard to get you going, but if you want to really get into it to set up your configurations, you need to know what you are doing with routers."
2,Missing The ONE Feature I Really Needed,"This wireless router (if you are going to use it as your main wireless router) is great. The signal is strong, and it isn't a huge chunk out of your wallet to buy. But if you are looking for a device that is going to be able to bridge a connection and function as a wireless router you are looking in the wrong place. I didn't find this out until after I purchased it. So here I am to warn the rest of you. BEWARE...you can not use this router as a bridging device. But if you are going to use it for a main wireless router you are fine. But I give it two stars for not listing its inability to do so...since the model DOWN from this one can...and the model above this one can...but oddly enough this specific model is unable to. 2 is what you get...and be happy I'm not giving it a 1."
1,Awful experience gaming with this router,"I had an awful experience with this router. It set up quickly and easily enough, and worked ok at first. The router was faster than my old b/g router. However, within a few days the problems started. I would wake up in the morning and the router had disappeared from my computer's network detection. Horrible latency spikes would plague my online gaming experience. Power cycling the cable modem and the router would fix these problems temporarily, but the reboots became more and more frequent. When the network started dropping inexplicably and all of a sudden, I had had enough. I'm returning this router, and never buying a D-Link ever again. Maybe my problems were a fluke? Well, then this would be the only negative review D-Link gets. Maybe I just didn't set the router up properly? Well, then maybe D-Link should have made it easier to set up. Either way, if you don't want headaches from your wireless router, my recommendation is you buy from a different brand."
3,rough start but great product,"The overall view of the product is great but was rough getting hooked up. Followed the CD exact steps but couldn't get it to hook up. Had to call service twice, both times they were very helpful, The second time did the trick. I love the D-Link, great coverage all over my house. We have two laptops both are upstairs, with the D-Link downstairs with the PC. Haven't tried outside yet but plan to."
3,D-link Router,"The main reason I purchased this router was to get better signal to another location in my home than I was getting with my g router. There was some improvement, but not nearly what I was expecting."
4,Very good equipment.,Was realy very easy and fast to set up.The wireless perfomance is realy good.Yes I recommend to friends.
1,Connection keeps dropping on me,"When this router's working it's great, but that's only half the time for me.I purchased this router over six months ago, and ever since I've had many problems with the connection dropping on several laptops in the house. I've updated the firmware, replaced the router with a newer one, and called tech support several times.They admitted a problem with some routers routinely dropping connections, and said for some there's no fix at this point. They said a future firmward upgrade could fix the problem, but couldn't guarantee it. Until I can get more consistent coverage, I can only give this router 1 star."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router Better than Belkin N+ Router,"Tried the Belkin N+ based on the recent Cnet Editor's Choice recommendation. After 3 calls to Belkin Tech Support to try to resolve dropped connections, I returned the unit and purchased the D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router. Since I have AT&T DSL, I needed to call D-Link Tech Support, as the CD installer is not compatible with DSL. A quick 15 minute call with D-Link resolved the issue. My unit has been trouble-free ever since! Unit would have earned a 5-star rating if the CD was compatible with DSL."
4,Great router,It's easy for me to setup. I'm an IT guy :). Great speed and range. Only complain I have is the super bright blue LED lines. I have to turn the router towards the wall. But I'm OK with it.
1,Don't buy D link xtreme if you have a mac,Bought a d link. Cd does not provide guidance for support for mac or software to install for mac. Technical support rude and unhelpful.
4,No problems!,"Everything went as it should - no issues. The speed is good, but nowhere near 300Mbps - maybe the cable signal is limiting my speed though. I am getting 3x faster connection speeds (verified thru speedtest.net). Very happy with this product."
5,"Strong signal, stable operation","I've owned and used this router for over 5 months now and not once have I needed to reset it or been struggling for signal within or around my home. It's neat, compact and looks good, although I have hidden it from view recently as the LED lighting is unnecessarily bright. Very happy with the purchase."
5,Still going after 3 years...,"The router hasn't really given me any trouble at all. I did have one PC that was dropping off the wireless network for a bit, but that was cured when I upgraded the NIC's firmware. Oh and be sure to upgrade the router's firmware on occasion. It does seem to help. I'd definitely buy another router like this one if it were necessary."
2,Frequently drops signal,"Purchased this router after reading reviews. Did very well for first 3 mths but soon after started dropping signals (wireless). If you have 4-5 devices connected to it, this drop in signal becomes very evident. At times, the router is not discoverable and frequently needs to be restarted. 2 stars because when it works, it sends a very strong signal. However, restarting the router frequently is undesirable. Drops signal almost once to twice a day now after 8 mths. Firmware update done but problem still persists. I want to like this router but the frequent drops make it very frustrating. Would not buy this again."
1,Stupid author,"Indeed, the author doesn't show much examples for most of theproblems. The author assumes students know how to solve the problems, therefore, she skips most of the details. This type of math is not very useful in today's society. It's really stupid!This is also an expensive book and it certainly not worth leaning when the author didn't show much details especially for the more difficult problems. She is a stupid, lazy author!"
5,Awaken to the Eternal: Nisargadatta Maharaj,"Simplicity, wisdom, and love are the impressions from this video. The video is composed of commentary of those who had experiences of Nisargadatta directly as well home video of Nisargadatta during his daily talks. For those who starve for a glimpse of an enlightened one then this video is a must. Three stars for video quality. Five stars for Subject."
1,NOT for LITTLE KIDS,"This movie is very inappropriate for little kids. I started to watch this with my young child ... thinking it would have a good Christian Christmas message and was confronted with the words ""HATE"" and ""STUPID"" and blatent lying and several other mean-spirited words and attitudes, such that I finally turned it off and had to tell my little one that it was not a good one to watch. Just be aware ..."
1,Another day camping destroyed by Holland Companion,Wife does cooking I was asked to get Companion out of front compartment of 5th wheel and set it up. I did and lit the burner. She comes out 20 minutes later and it is still cold. I turn off gas open lid wait several minutes. Re-lite close lid check to make sure it is lit. All OK 5 minutes later I look again and it went out. Re-lite two minutes later out again. This goes on for 45 Minutes. Wife cooks meat in oven inside RV. Now I have to stand on my head to clean RV oven. This happens all the time with this grill. Wind outside over 2 MPH and it will NOT stay lit. Even dead calm when you open the lid it goes out.DO NOT BUY this piece of JUNK.
3,Good deal under the right circumstances,"First and foremost, this has to be one of the best instruments I have ever owned as far as intonation... Bang on all up and down the fret board.Having said that, the frets were not properly finished... Sharp overhangs made initial jams painful. I was able to carefully file down the neglected frets.Setup right out of the box wasn't terrible. I prefer a less buzzy sound, so I raised the action a bit. Again, the intonation is amazing.Disappointed that a lakland gig bag wasn't included... Kind of a slap in the face, after selling a bass with such a poor fret job. Luckily I had an extra. They did include a very crappy little 6 foot patch cable... So nice of them.Once I got over how cheap Lakland is, I fell in love with the bass. Took some work to get there, but all in all great bass.INCREDIBLY annoyed by their business ethics."
5,remarkably fine writing,it is an educational religious but speculative and meditative pure theological book. It is easy to swallowin light reading style. I would recommend it to religous persons.
3,stakes,It has been a long time since a Vampire movie has kept me on the edge of my seat. Stakes will do just that! The talents of Joe Ripple and Don Dohler will be a force to contend with in the future. They have manged to assemble a talented and unique cast. The movie will keep you entertained from start to finish. The fight scenes and sepcial effects have all the qualities of a big budget Hollywood production. ... Bravo to Timewarp films!
2,Mistakes,The mistake you can make is buying this film.Plot? Vampires from a paralell Earth (one ruled by Vampires) come to our planet and are closely pursued by a trio of vampire killers.Why is it that all aliens speak American English?The busty queen of the vampires doesn't even show us her best asset.
5,Terrific Vampire Horror!,"Don Dohler and Joe Ripple have done it again! STAKES is just as good as their last movie, HARVESTERS, and they've raised the bar on special effects with this edge-of-your-seat vamp-fest. When ""pure-blood"" vampires from another dimension decide to infest earth with their kind, a small cadre of vampire hunters springs into action utilizing a very special kind of vamp-killing device. Feast your eyes on Leanna Chamish as Queen of the Vampires, wow! Only Ms. Chamish could pull off a sexy star turn like the one she gives us in STAKES. Great special effects, lots of action, excellent plotting and a wonderful cast makes STAKES another sure-fire classic from Timewarp films. I can't wait for their next film, which is going to be about zombies! Timewarp rocks!"
5,A must,This is a great little book. It should be used in conjunction with the Big Book and the 12 X 12. I suggest finding the Little Red Book Guide to accompany it. I use them with my sponsees.
5,this is great,"No recovery is complete without it, great little book to carry with you . arrive quickly and in good shape"
3,Not up to par,"This book was very good exept it did not pick up the hanging lines from the last book. What I saw was an attempt to work 9/11 into some of it. It seemed rushed and not put together as wll as the other books. However, it is still a good book and very entertaining."
2,Not quite up to others,"More of a 2 1/2I enjoyed this book, but did not think it was up to the previous in the series. The main problem was that it was disjointed in its plotting and pace. It felt like they had the basic book together and then created a separate plot line (or two) and wedged it in there. It broke up the main story and created a lack of cohesion that was bothersome. Sherman and Cragg have pulled off parallel plots before with great success, so I know they can do it. They just seemed all over the place in this one.(Minor spoiler alert)This is also the first book where the major campaign was not completed. I'm not adverse to cliffhangers per se, but there wasn't really any true build up and the termination seemed arbitrary.I still loved the characters and the writing itself is as exciting as usual. I hope these fine authors can get back on a more cohesive track with the next volume."
5,Finally someone understands.....,"For those of us who are veterans of countless overseas moves, and perhaps particularly for first-time expats, what a relief it is to find this book, which so movingly and wittily defines the expatriate process. Yes, there are countless benefits to an international life, but there is also the pain and heartache of upheaval, rootlessness, missed loved ones and a career set indefinitely on hold. Robin Pascoe holds a mirror up to the expat soul, and shows it for what it is: delighted, resentful, joyful and miserable, and often all on the same day. The glue that holds every overseas assignment together is the accompanying spouse, and Ms. Pascoe's book is the best how-to guide a girl ever had. Don't leave home without it....."
3,A good starting place in preparing for a move abroad,"We are planning a move to the UK within the next year, and I bought this to prepare myself for what it might be like. The book is helpful in the broadest sense, in that it gives one an idea of what one woman's emotional experiences have been like. However I found it lacking in the practical detail that I craved - how to estimate standard of living differences, how to navigate school systems and make schooling choices, even how to decide what household objects to take with us and what to leave behind.That said, though, I still think that this is a book worth buying and holding on to if you are comtemplating an international move for your partner's work. I expect to find it useful *after* the move as well."
2,"Great show, insulting Blu-Ray.","Before this Blu-Ray will allow you to get to the (very good) TV series you purchased, you will be forced to sit through... what? A half-dozen advertisements? More? These cannot be skipped, the ""Menu"" button was locked down. The most you can do is fast-forward... you know, as though we still lived in the days of VHS.This may be a 4 or 5-star cartoon, but it's a 1 or 2-star Blu-Ray release. You're buying a lot of advertising. I recommend passing on this purchase; Lionsgate shouldn't be rewarded for this kind of customer abuse."
5,Lives up to the 90's version.,This DVD was great. It was just as good as the 90's version (that I grew up on). I really wish they had continued this series. It was very well done and the drawing was good. They did change the story line somewhat from the 90's version but It was done in such a way that I didn't mind at all. I highly recommend this DVD to any X-Men fan.
3,Not Red's Best Work,"As the #1 fan of The Red Green show, having watched since the first season, recorded every episode, watched each at least 200 times, own all the DVD's and VHS tape specials, etc... it's hard to say this is not a good book, but it's just not. The humor here is not 'Red Green' it's Steve Smith... it's not geared toward the average middle-aged man, it's geared toward yuppies who would call this 'levity'... So, do yourself a favor, read the sample pages available on this page before you buy the book... it doesn't get any better. I think part of the charm of Steve Smith is his facial expressions... so, written word is out of his element. But maybe I'm just making excuses for him... the fact remains, this book is not in the least bit funny or insiteful. Red Green is funny, Steve Smith is 'witty', but just barely, at that. Steve, stick to what made you famous instead of selling out to the yuppy, office, New York Times crowd."
4,Great comfort for cold feet,"These were a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she wears them every night and some mornings. She loves the way they keep her feet warm, but wishes the bottoms were a little more comfortable."
4,why it's not a 5,"I think the ending is a little lame. However, this book has several interesting and well-written characters, a nice suspenseful plot, and isn't totally fluff. It's a good book to curl up to on a rainy day (which is what I did)."
5,Actually releases stress,"Yoga Zone Conditioning & Stress Release delivers what it promises. By focusing on major stress points in the body such as the neck, shoulders, wrists, pelvic area, and back, this video is the answer to my hectic days. I actually look forward to doing these exercises at the end of a long day, because it helps me relax and unwind. I do not blame the previous reviewer for actually falling asleep at the end of the session - it's that effective. And I would have to credit Alan Finger for his soothing voice and encouraging manner of instructing yoga students. While he gives out the instructions, his two senior yoga instructors perform the poses, with one doing the modified postures for those who are less flexible. Two thumbs up for this video."
2,Beginner even for a beginner,"This video is way to basic, and you barely get anything out of it. Too much talking and not enough flowing. If you're a beginner, start with the intermediate videos. They're just as easy to follow, but you get more out of them."
5,A revolution,"This is not a ballet you might expect. Furthermore, it may not be categorized as a ballet. This is a new type of art that nobody ever anticipated. The choreographer, Glen Teley, used the work of Stravinsky as just a material and created a new genre of art."
3,Worked for me but has flaws,Taking this CLEP test was the last thing I needed to do to graduate. I had just finished a semester of student teaching American History. I studied for about 8 over the course of 2 days. I took one practice exam before studying and got a 54 and after studying I got a 60. I will warn you the practice exams are easier than the actual exam. While taking the exam I thought it was very difficult and I thought I was on the track to failure. In the end I passed the CLEP exam with a 54. If you have not already taken college level coursework in World History I would not recommend just using this book. I now have a college degree and I am ready to take on the world.
2,Get what you pay for.,"This review is about the free download version of Nesmuk's book available here on Amazon.Spend the extra and buy the 99-Cent edition, which has all the diagrams and illustrations missing from the free edition.Yes, it's somewhat dated, we have better equipment, and probably wouldn't live on a diet of beans and bacon, nor hope to buy food items from farmers along the way, or take a mule with us, but living out is living out, and the basic concepts are still sound."
4,A wonderful anachronism,"""Nessmuk"" wrote for an era when much of the lower 48 was still wilderness, and his writings are an entertaining time machine trip to a long-gone era. Myself, I enjoyed reading the book very, very much. But you can no longer start a campsite by cutting down a half-dozen trees!"
3,Excellent Read and Adventurous,Excellent glimpse into the mindset and equipment used by earlier outdoorsmen. The fieldcraft used by Mr. Sears is as relevant today as it was then. My only disappointment was all the illustrations were missing.
5,Smooth it,"' We do not go to the green woods and crystal waters to rough it we go to smooth it. We have it rough enough at home...'' The temptation is to buy this or that bit of indispensable camp kit has been too strong and we have gone to the blessed woods handicapped with a load fit for a pack mule. That is not how to do it.Go light, and the lighter the better so that you have the simplest material for health comfort and enjoyment. 'NessmukNessmuk is the pen name of George Washington Sears. In 1884 he wrote the book Woodcraft and Camping and it has been in print ever since. His approach to camping is satisfyingly philosophical and completely practical. Worthy reading for anyone who wants to take to the woods."
4,Good Addition,"I got this add on to help the CO2 usage since the A5 uses more than say my girlfriends 98 but it has made it a lot more consistent with shots you still have the occasional off shot, also give you more use out of you're tank it's a great upgrade for the money"
2,Not worth the $40 I paid,"The flyer in the mail looked provocative and full of valuable information. The book cost $40. I can't believe I ordered it. Hardcover, yes, but low quality paper and printing, no photos or color, so why the high price? The information inside was not presented in a readable or interesting manner. I haven't tried the recipes. I have a wheat allergy and this book doesn't have gluten-free recipes, just sugar-free. I plan to try out their claim that this book comes with a life-time guarantee and can be returned."
5,Great Boy Dress-Up,"My son, who loves dressing up in Harry Potter capes and the like, loves this. So far, it has been durable, although he is not terribly rough on it. Very funny to watch it inflate."
4,More Quinlan,"This installment of the clone wars has an interesting enough plot showcasing what would happen if the separatists started using clones too. Some background information is also given, most importantly how master Tholme lost his eye. This was a good volume but not as good as volume 9 was."
5,Thumbs Up,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie. It is a refreshing respite from violence and trash-talk films.I recommend it as a wholesome movie for the whole family. It takes place in a more innocent time when people truly cared about each other. The storyline is believable and the cast does a superb job. If you like movies like ""Cross Creek"" then you will benefit from buying this movie."
3,Too darn hot,The kettle is beautiful if you don't use it. The handle gets too hot and it is dangerous. I really am surprised with this design flaw.
3,Great mirror - if it would stay put - DS tape is worthless,Love the mirror. Exactly what they advertised - except for the double sided tape to put it on. Totally useless.
1,"Mirror is too small, and mirror snaps off too easily during adjustments","Mirror is too small and hence can't really see much behind. Also, mirror snaps off too easily during adjustments."
4,Good mirror for street biking,"I have used other types of bike mirrors but, for riding over bouncy roads and trails none of them will last with the shaking. This one does. I does take a little bit of getting used to the small size but once you over come that it is easy to use."
1,loose socket,"This is a terrible mirror. It stuck to my helmet well enough, but it often pops out of the attachment. My biggest complaint though, is that the universal ball joint is way too loose. It requires constant readjustment- the slightest head wind, down hill or road vibration and the mirror moves, rendering it useless. My husband has the third eye, and it's much better. I'm getting one of those."
1,Keep looking,"Doesn't stick to helmet well. I got this for my wife and she won't use it. Even when you get it to stay, it doesn't do much good and she hates the look."
3,Good if you don't mind a lot of repairs,"Got this for my wife, I use a handlebar mirror myself. First of all the adhesive holding the mirror to the helmet is very temporary. If fell off while my wife was riding but was not damaged. Resolved this by cementing the base on to the helmet with urethane cement (Aquaseal). Then after a couple of months the wire in the arm broke. Replaced the broken wire with an old stainless steel spoke. Then the ball joint broke. Permanently attached the mirror to the arm (spoke) with steel wire. Then mirror fell out of its mount. Fortunately my wife saw it fall out and recovered it. Cemented this in place with urethane cement. Now after all of that repair activity I moved the mirror to my wife's newest helmet and its been good for about 3 years with no further repair or work. A good design that would be a whole lot better made with more durable materials and better adhesives. Oh well."
1,Duped,"Sounded great from reviews, self-proclamation and general subject but it's personal style is too difficult to submerge yourself in and get benefit from; it's logic is from personal and 1-source referencing; and it's a little boring, which was quite surprising since the whole genre and ""slap-in-the-face"" truth were compelling."
2,A little on the dull side,"I enjoyed the first few chapters, and then it just got monotonous. Same old stuff, I thought I was different. Perhaps it is because I am also a sober alcoholic - once you get past the details, the stories are all pretty much the same. I have been helped over the years by so many recovering alcoholics who have shared their stories, experience and hope with me - for free. I guess I have a bias against those who are making money/receiving fame from it.I would suggest that anyone who wants to really learn about alcoholism read ""Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women have Recovered From Alcoholism"", and those who have family members who are alcoholic may benefit from literature from the Alanon Family Groups."
3,Interesting and informative book,"I read this book in an effort to understand someone else's drinking behaviour and found I could understand the author's feelings and found the way she described her addiction quite informative. I lent this to a young girl whose father's alcoholism forced her to leave home and go into fostercare, she said she read it 4 times as she found it so enlightening in assisting her understand her father's behaviour though naturally she is still unable to live with that. It also increased my awareness about how drinking may get out of hand with many people, increasing in importance to a level that may be both unsafe and unhealthy."
1,blecch,"A worthless book, utterly fraudulent and self-congratulatory. Finishing it leads to a bad hangover. Skip it."
5,"The real story, and well written too.","This is an excellent work that holds it's own among the best autobiographies written in the last fifty years. It is also perhaps the finest, most in depth, and honest account of what it is truly like to live as an active alcoholic. I know: I am an alcoholic in recovery like Caroline. Even if you, a loved one, or a friend do not have a problem with booze read this book anyway. It is a seldom-equaled tale of the growth and healing of a wonderful, intelligent woman who also happens to be a superlative writer."
3,Hollow,"While I read the book I felt hollow, like I was taking in the words but I felt nothing. It's not that I didn't understand what she was saying, the words just seemed devoid of the human aspect of dependency. I could have done without the first half of the book completely. It was tedious and I never connected with the author's plight. The second half was a little better for me. I saw a friend of mine in the second half and that helped a little...because I could put a human experience with the narrative. And that's what the book lacked. A feeling that someone, a caring human with feelings, was writing it. I never connected with the author no matter how much I wanted to understand her story. I felt like I was reading a weak story about someone written by a third person. It would have been a one-star if not for the second half."
4,Well-written Memoir!,"A well-written story of drinking...and its consequences. A modern...Lost Weekend! This is from a female perspective. I just read ""Perambulations"" by C S Back- similar tale from a male viewpoint!"
5,A Game Changer,"The theory the author proposes in this work if true will change our view of history. He provides compelling evidence that there was ancient and consistent African presence in the Americas. The evidence provided is abundant and well documented. Please, Read it for your self and draw your own conclusions.In the end it left me wanting more. Why has there not been more written about this? Why has there not been more research? Who is going to follow up on the important work that was started here? This book had me thirsting for more knowledge. Hopefully it will inspire more research, so that more light can be shed. The theories here are too important to be left without a definitive answer."
1,Truly pathetic!,"This book is an insult to empirical scholarship, i.e. scholarship based on critically interrogated facts. If it is of use, and that is a big ""IF"", it is as a diagnostic of the political environment of the late 20th century that somehow thought a filiopietistic approach to African/Afro-American history was culturally useful even if it did abject violence to any real sense of Native American history AND denigrated Native Americans. Here's what is truly appalling, some publicly supported cultural institution was underwriting this clap-trap while serious scholars of PreColumbian America were scratching for funding. Makes me sick to think about!"
2,I'm not convinced,"This book could be interesting, but the author never seems to present any definite, solid evidence for anything. I think the evidence is out there, but he does a poor job in conveying it. And he goes off on tangents about the racism of previous scholars that have nothing to do with the subject of African contact with the New World. I would recommend finding another book about this subject instead of reading this one."
5,Splendid attempt at the truth by a truth seeker.,"The people professionally engaged in discovering the truth are those, psychologically, least capable of accepting the truth if it happens to contradict what they already believe. Mr. Van Sertima's book is clearly iconoclastic, which makes it controversial, because it departs from myopic pedagogy that credits Columbus with discovering a place already inhabited."
5,An excellent tell all that dispells the myth of Columbus.,This book should be text book material for young readers as well as accomplished historians. I didn't get to read it until I was in graduate school and it made me excited and eager to learn more about the untold truth of my African Ancestors. When I find a copy of this book it will be required reading for my children.
1,Disappointing,"This is not at all what I thought when I first read the item description, or else I was in too much of a hurry to read it. It barely measures four ounces, I thought it measured much more. This might be good if you're using it for travel, but I can't imagine that you'd even find it helpful when traveling."
3,Chaise Lounge,"Easy to assemble, I've had these now for a full season outdoors in New England, they held up through the winter, making it through with just one crack. The teak is OK quality not super smooth, recommend applying teak oil."
4,I love them,"I think the two chaise lounges I purchased are great! They are well built and easy to put together. I'm not concerned about any possible ""bleeding"" of the stain, which I have never seen on any product from Strathwood (and I have purchased four other products from them). Every year I apply new oil to the other Strathwood products, and I expect to do the same with the chaises-that is what is required with real wood if you want to have the brown look."
4,Good value but watch for stains!,"The chairs are pretty much as pictured, moderately difficult to assemble and pretty sturdy. The roll around very easily on the wheels and fit almost any standard lounge cushion.*** Be aware of stains. When not in use we roll our chairs over to some mulch beds as rain will cause these chairs to drop a lot of stain ***"
4,No Problems Here!,"We almost didn't order because of the different reviews---we had only minor problems putting the two chairs together (it isn't a ten-minute task). They look great, are sturdy and well-made. We haven't had any orange leakage like others reported, and they've been through four or five major rains as well as spraying them down with a hose. While not as wonderfully designed and sturdy as grade-a teak, they also didn't cost $800 apiece. Awesome quality and style for the price."
5,Strathwood Chaise Lounge,Excellent value... look great... only suggestion is that you may need to pre-drill some of the holes as they are not big enough for the screws provided.
5,Sturdy Product,"I was amazed on how sturdy the product was for the price. Don't know how it will weather yet, but it looks great. Pretty easy to assemble. You will be glad you bought this."
5,Strathwood Hardwood Chaise Lounge,"I was amazed at how well the chaise was built. For it's cost it is well worth the money, if fact we bought a second one as soon as we received the first one. They also did an amazing job packaging it for shipment. Both chaises arrived with no damage. There is a little assembly that needs to be done but you don't need any tools to do it, if you have tools all the easier."
3,In The Long Run,"I've had 2 lounges 3 years. Last year I kept it out thru the winter and the snow and water did a number on it. The wheels cracked apart, the table support disconnected and the back rest support broke. I've mended it over the past few weeks and I'm going to store it inside again. I'll get another year out of them and then it will be time for a replacement. For the price, it is a deal but the weather will get to them eventually."
1,DO NOT BUY,"While the lounge chairs we received looked good and we have received compliments, they have ruined the cushions that we purchased to go on them. The stain has come off of the chairs ruining the concrete deck below them and the cushions that were $100 a piece that go on them. What an absolute mess. There is stain on my BRAND NEW cushions and on the pool deck below them that we are unable to get out. DO NOT BUY THESE CHAIRS! I am now having to start over with chairs and cushions. What an absolute disappointment!"
4,"Nice produce for the price, but 1 or 4 broken","I purchased four. They are nicely packed, and look great for a low price, but one of the four was broken.I decided to glue the broken wood together rather than return it."
3,GREAT CHAIRS - IF THEY COME UNBROKEN!,"I purchased three of these chairs... Two arrived fine, but one had several broken parts so BEWARE!!! The packages that arrive when purchasing this product are VERY cumbersome, so it's tough to even sent these back. I did get a 15% discount from Amazon when I informed that I received broken parts. Which I guess is ok. I would have sent the broken one back, but the chairs are on backorder, so it would have been 3 months till I received a new one.The two that arrive unbroken are great. They are a little narrow, which many people might have a problem with - so again, beware. But overall, the chairs are beautiful and for the price, they are a smoking deal."
5,Strathwood Chaise,"This has been a great purchase for a quality built product and a very affordable lounge. Easy to put together (when you follow the instructions) in about 20 minutes. I would reccomend using an allen wrench bit in a drill for ez, rather than by hand. I wood recommend this product. I did purchase two of these. San Francisco Area."
1,disappointed,"i read the reviews of the chaise prior to buying, and felt confident that they would be a great deal. they showed up on time; one was damaged but not worth the hassle of returning, but i live in oregon and it rain some in the spring and early summer. these chaise's bleed their stain and left two large stains on my patio. if you have a concrete patio it could ruin it! luckily i have paver's and will have to flip them over at some point. i would not have bought them knowing this, and would have ponied up for real teak."
1,Lounge Chairs Leave Stains on Patio,We bought 2 of these chairs and placed them on our brand new stone pool patio. After the first rain storm we noticed that our pavers were stained underneath the chairs. The stains became a deep rust color and we had to power wash and scrub the patio but the stains didn't come out. We then had to replace many of the damaged pavers and eventually placed a rug under the chairs to prevent any more damage. Any water including morning dew causes the chairs to bleed. We tried to return them but because it was longer than 30 days we were unable to get all our money back. I would not recommend these chairs if they are to be used on a patio.
3,Good price - a few quirks,"This item couldn't be priced better, and for the money, it's a decent chair. The wood is very pretty and of seemingly good quality. The assembly is minimal and simple ... that is, if you recieve all of the bolts. I, unfortunately, did not and am forced to make a pilgrimage to Lowes to find something comparable. I may call the (not toll free!) Strathwood number to see if they will send replacement parts, but I suspect that will take nothing short of a lifetime to recieve.After shopping for chaises, though, the price on this chair can't be beat. And with free shipping and minimal assembly, it is worth it. A word to the wise though ... ""usually ships in 24 hours"" means you will probably recieve it two weeks later."
1,"Awful & Beyond Disappointed, piece of garbage!","I attached a picture warning all! This chaise lounge is NOT weather-proof. The product used to stain this wood will completely wash off and destroy whatever is under the chair. We have tried power washing to no avail. Seems we will need to replace the entire section of patio stone that the chair was placed on. There is NO warning that this item will not hold up in rain, just the opposite, manufacturer claims this item is completely weather proof and only requires an occassional teak oil rub in order to avoid the ""over-time weathering look"" of exposed hard wood. Beyond disappointed.....Strathwood Chaise Lounge"
2,Not worth the effort,"I bought two Adirondack chairs and two chaises. They do look good. However, one Adirondack chair came with the wrong screws and I had to call the company to get the right ones. The company was cooperative. I also found a broken piece and ended up just gluing it on. I just started putting the chaise together. The screws for the sidebar legs are definitely not the right size. The Adirondack has been outside since the end of May and is definitely showing signs of fading and peeling. I disagree with the man who said they appear sturdy. I would not let my elderly mother sit in one for fear it may collapse and she only weighs 130 lbs."
3,Adequate for the price,Delivery was great and it was relatively easy to set up. the only drawback is that the chair is made of cheap wood and it appears easy to crack
4,lounge only,I love this product but it is not suitable for sitting up if you like to read like I do.
1,"Works, but very hard and slow","The pump works, but it took us over 1/2 hour to inflate a wedge pillow. I could have blown it up faster without it! I wouldn't buy another one."
4,Not as good as 1 or 2,"This game was focusing on graphics, which limited this game to making enough starting cars. This game is annoying in the beginning because it is too hard to get cash. I'd recommend getting this only if you've beaten gran turismo 1 and 2 first."
5,WHAT IS GOING ON?!,"... GT has always been the #1 racing game on the psx and then the second one was launched...and still you got more cars, more tracks, more parts for your car...and more fun! This version (A-spec) is going to be the greatest game so far. The graphics are sick, ive watched all the movies you could find, and the cars and the overall depth of that game is amazing! You can do soo much more than just drive in this game!!!"
3,Fun for a little while,"As with many PS2 games, the graphics are wonderful. But as with many PS2 games, it's just not that much fun to play after a while. As soon as you move to the mode where tire wear is on, it's so frustrating. Every car on the track can go more laps than you can. Your tires wear faster than the other cars and your performance goes down while the other cars do not. It's too bad. Games that cheat like that shouldn't be encouraged. It's fun and you should buy it. But you'll get bored and frustrated with it after a while. After that, just get rid of it."
1,I don't think so.,"I just want to say that this is a racing game if u haven't already figured that out. If u like ur games to have a little more substance then u won't like this. I will admit that the built-in rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism. It is very realistic, like when you get hit or go across a bumpy dirt road, you feel every hit and feel every bump, but that's basically the only thing it has going for it."
3,GT3,"I must say the graphics and sound are excellent, they are second to none. The problem is with the lack of cars, this game is on a DVD and a DVD has 9 times the storage of a CD yet Gran Turisimo 2 has at least 300 cars to choose from. You can tell this game has been rushed to cash in on PS2 new product poularity. This game could have been so much better.SO overall good graphics, sound lack of depth. Grand Turisimo 2 is still the king."
5,I know I haven't played it but,"two things that annoy me a bit are the way the cars bounce off everthing(if you tapped another cars bumper in real life you woudn't bounce back) and the tunnel like play-bounce off the walls,nothing is affected by the cars. Other than that it puts to shame every other game"
5,Gran Turismo 3 Kicks....well mabey I shoudln't say it,"All I have to say is ...well this game is great and there is no other like it:)Although The simulation mode kinda sucks The arcade iz great cuz you can race the ""S Class"" cars which i think r the bestYou like and have played the first ones then you'd better buy this oneMy Rating:*****(a full 5 *'s)!!!!!!!!!!!..."
5,Its a keeper,"This game is a must have for PS2 owners. I didn't like cars that much before I bought this game, but now I'm getting into them. The physics are pretty real (although I've never driven at 150 MPH) except for the crash physics. There is no damage physics in this game. If u hit a wall, the car slows down, but it escapes unscratched. I though this was weird, and it does detract from the game a little, but then I thought of what the game would be like if there was damage. Crusin down a straight away in your 2 million dollar car when the CPU cuts you off, sending you into the wall. There goes a couple of weeks of work. Fortuneatley this never happens. Even if you aren't a car freak, you'll like this game."
4,Excellent game!,"Excellent graphics, excellent game play, improved difficulty. This game has it all, but... It's much more difficult to obtain money on the simulation mode. Fewer cars than it's predessor also detracts a bit from the game. They really should have included used cars to help get started. The menus are cleaned up, but you still have to back out of your menu when you buy a new part. I would have given it 5 stars, but the difficulty in earning money initially detracts a bit from the experience. It is, however, the most remarkably realistic game I've ever had the pleasure to play. Very highly recommended purchase!"
3,It's just like the other Gran Turismo games,"Theres really no difference between this game and the other Gran Turismo games. The differences graphics, tracks, and cars. The handling can be troubling sometimes. There are no Porsche's and Ferrari's which make the game worse. If your a new comer to the Gran Turismo series then this would be a great game, but if you have the other two then don't waist your time on this one."
3,Fair,"You have a ton of cars to choose from which is awesome! But they made it way to difficult to get them. You find yourself just running the same races over and over and over and over for hours just to build your cash up so you can move on. EXTREMELY BORING!After playing Need For Speed Underground, the action in this game seems so slow like the cars are barelly crawling along.I also didn't like that in the game you had to do little drivers exam courses to move up to the next class of drivers license. I thought it was pretty lame, boring and a waste of time. They tried to make this game as realistic as possible, which is good to a point, but somewhere along the lines they forgot it was a game.This game does have one of the best soundtracks out there for a ps2 game."
2,Nice game if you don't want a realistic racer,"Don't get me wrong. The cars look great. The parts upgrades are awsome. But there is darn little realism in the racing. Got a problem with the guy right ahead of you? Just smack him into the wall on the next turn. Sure, you'll slow down some, but he will slow down a lot and you won't do ANY damage to you car. Nope, no matter how bad you screw up and hit the wall, you still have a factory clean race car with no mechanical problems. I prefer there to be some sort of realism with collisions, but that may just be me."
3,Gran Turismo 3,"Not only have I played Gran Turismo 3 (which you can do at Sony's Metreon and other places that rock), I have a press-copy of the game. I'm impressed, but it's not as earth-shaking as I hoped it would be. I'm still optimistic that Sony will get it right before releasing it--I'd much rather spend another couple of months anticipating a great game than get a rush-to-production copy that isn't as good as it could have been."
2,There is no racing in this racing game,"GT3 is a big disappointment. The game has turned into a massive menu maze in which you must navigate and modify every little aspect of your car. The licsense module is also a pain to use. You must complete and sucessfully pass all the different course tests etc, in order to race certain tracks and events. The racing courses are the same ones from the previous GT's. This is part of the problem of the game as well. If you have played both GT1 and two, there are not many new courses for you to race on. The couses are just from the previous versions with upgraded graphics.The graphics are superior, but the game drags on and on with the menus and upgrade screens. This game is no longer a racing game as much as it is a game dealing with menus. At it still would be a waste of your money. You would do better to just rent the game and save yourself, yet another game, that will just sit on the shelf collecting dust."
1,TERRIBLE,THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. GET MIDNIGHT CLUB OR TOKYO EXTREME RACER ZERO.
3,"Wonderful graphics and realism, but a little bit boring","This game gets 5 stars for realism in terms of gameplay, 5 stars for having the most beautiful realistic graphics I've ever seen, 5 stars for the sound effects and music. There are lots of options for almost everything you can think of. This is a very well done game. The only thing that is missing is the FUN. Its so realistic that its a little bit boring. And so for the lack of any real fun factor I give this game 3 stars. This game came with my PlayStation2 and it really shows off what the PlayStation2 can do. Anyone who likes realistic games will love this game. Its got the realism of the feel of real high speed racing. When I play this game I feel like I'm really driving. But the realism for me is the killer of the game. In my opinion ""Test Drive Off Road: Wide Open"" and ""Crazy Taxi"" are much more fun to play than this one is. The reason? They are fantasy games, unrealistic, and they are not held back by the need to be realistic."
4,GT3,"I have mixed opinions on GT3. On one hand, it is the perfect game combining superb graphics, realistic sounds and massive attention to detail with strategic game play, working out what and when to buy and sell to ensure maximum return on your car purchases.On the other hand there have been some glaring omissions. For me its the inability to use the second analogue controller for acceleration and breaking like you can in F1 2001. There is too much emphasis on the replay rather than the game play graphics and other parts of the game just are not up to the standard as the demo's that are so widely publicised. Having said all that - it is really a great game and perfect for those who love driving simulators but are looking for that little bit more."
3,It's All Right,Well the game is good but i would like to see some Pontiac Cars like the Firebird and the TA's but over all the game play is not bad.
4,Not bad,Do not have any big surprise from the previous GT2 & GT1. This game mainly gives you the same fun as the previous ones but with better graphic & pictures.
1,What a waste!,"I'm glad this isn't the first yoga video I bought, because I would have never kept going with it! This video is excrutiatingly boring, the instructor sounds like he's floating among the treetops, the participants look like zombies, the music is mundane, and to top it all off, it's way too long! The first and only time I used this tape, it put my 18-month old son to sleep! If you don't like to waste time or money and are looking for effective yoga videos, I highly recommend ""Crunch: The Joy of Yoga"" and Karen Voight's ""Yogasculpt""."
4,Yoga Zone: Introduction to yoga,"GREAT! I had bought the introduction to yoga book, but was not sure if I was doing the postures correctly. The video helped me to understand correct Yoga breathing, and gave me confidence that I was doing Yoga correctly. While the tape does not have a lot of postures, it taught me enough that I can now do all the postures in my book with confidence. I have already recommended this tape and the intro to Yoga book by Yoga Zone to family and friends. It is relaxing and I can see an improvement in my upper body strength."
5,excellent foundation,This tape was an excellent foundation for learning yoga. I did this tape to learn the basics and found it extremely helpful when I started the other tapes by yoga zone. It's simple enough for even the most out of shape beginners and effective enough for everyone to feel like the had a nice relaxing workout. Leaves your muscles worked and your whole body rejuvinated. It's a great tape to start your Yoga collection with. The other beginner tapes are also easy to follow but with this one under your belt you'll feel well prepared.
1,a collection of film school projects,"Something I have not seen mentioned anywhere is the fact that this is a collection of ""Film school projects"", Xenia Seeberg only appeared in it as a favor to someone who knew the director (Before she appeared in LEXX). If this is the best Nick Lyon could do while in film school perhaps he should have taken up carpentry instead. To everyone in the film industry worldwide: ""PLEASE NEVER LET NICK LYON NEAR A MOVIE CAMERA, EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!!!"" SHAME ON THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT!!! The only reason this DVD was released is to shamelessly try to cash in on Xenia Seebergs popularity and sucess with ""LEXX"". Xenia Seeberg fans please take note: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS!!! this is a terrible waste of a perfectly good plastic DVD case."
1,Did a 14 year old make this story up!?!?!,"The story was boring and poorly written. Xenia seeberg is an ok actress with a nice body. She couldn't do anything to make it worth watching. I gave It a star because I liked the music video ""Here comes the pain"". If you are a hard core Christian don't watch it. It has Chist on a cross cursing. It has a music video with a remake of a Depeche mode song ""never let me down again"". I never thought I would see Xenia seeberg singing never let me down again in a wild west saloon wearing 1800's atire. The man singing with her has a very annoying voice. Like nails to the ears. It was nice to hear xenia sing a song that I like."
4,James K Polk,nice story about Polk's life and career. A little juvenile but a quick easy informative read
2,High expectations!,"I really had high expectations before receiving this book. The author is known for creating books that show really cool tutorials (i.e. Photoshop). This book really disappointed me. When I saw ""Accelerated"" I pictured a book that explained the secrets behind what you see on the web. Instead it's a pre-school style book that takes you through the most basic steps. Not in any way meant for the intermediate to advanced user of Flash."
2,Flash mx 2004 accelerated,"This book is not what you want, you don't learn much as most of the guides are half done on an enclosed CD. Also, it does not cover much on action script, which i believe is one of the main aspects of Flash Mx. There are better books out there that teach you to create flash objects from scratch (meaning you won't end up in a confused mess thinking, how did they do that). on the plus, the book is clear, well presented and a few of the projects are easy to follow. in my opinion there are better books on the market."
2,Just shoot me in the foot...please!!!!,"With the word ""ACCLERATED"" I thought it would mean atleast at little bit above average. But I should have heeded the words of previous reviewers:FOR BEGINNERS ONLY.And beginners still would get alot more help from books like Flash Mx 2004 visually or How to do everything Flash mx 2004."
4,Truly excellent! The American Revolution all over again,"I first read this book from the library. When I went back 2 years later to re-read it and found they no longer had a copy, I immediately bought my own copy. Just as the response of our Forefathers was to to fight a tyrannical government, this book shows what could very likely happen should everyday citizens get fed up with the excesses of Big Government in the 20th century. While the book does suffer somewhat from less than top-notch editing, it is still well worth reading for anyone concerned with government intrusion into the lives of the private citizens it is supposed to be supporting. For a first-time novelist, Mr Ross has done an outstanding job."
5,Gotta Read It,"I found this book to be the best that I have ever read hands down. I lost many nights of sleep while this book was being read for the simple fact that I never wanted to lay it down. It kept you on the edge of your seat all of the time. You were always wondering what was going to happen next and were seldom right in your speculation. Even though it was more than 800 pages it is a very quik read. Always building up to the next level and never letting you down. I highly recomend this book. It used the right mixture of both fact and fiction to keep it very interesting all of the time. I found it to keep you thinking, never letting your mind rest. I found the charachters to be very inviting and easily identified with. I have to warn you though, this book is very addictive. In my opinion, not a bad thing in this case. Top Notch by any means, I can't say enough good things about it. Buy it....now....you must have it."
5,"A gripping must-read book, marred by excess length and sex","Even though this book is about 300-400 pages too long and contains nonessential and distracting sexual activity it rates a must-read. The theme of excessive government power is old but this book shows how the warnings of Jefferson, Paine, Madison, and Henry are still valid today in this country. I add my vote for a PG or PG-13 version which could see wider distribution; I'd buy several copies."
1,An insult to the word novel,"If you want completely unbelievable characters, twisted history, and awful writing this is the book for you!To start with, this book does more to harm ""gun culture"" than it could ever possibly help. It caters to the most extreme fringes of those involved in firearms. Any one who isn't as extreme in their views that happens on this book will be solidly put off.On top of this is some of the worst pacing and characterization I've had the pleasure to read in years. LITTLE DID THIS AMAZON BUYER KNOW IN THREE DAYS HE WOULD RECEIVE A TERRIBLE BOOK pretty much matches most of what I loosely call foreshadowing. Every main character is a carbon copy with superhuman skills and one minor and utterly unimportant flaw to differentiate them.I can only recommend this if you believe the government will overthrow the Constitution in the near future and you want to know how to use non-existing ammo to kill ATF agents."
5,A wish for a non-fictional sequel!!!,"Throughout ""Unintended Consquences"" I found myself saying things like ""I remember when that happened!"" and ""I wonder if that is really did happen?"" and ""That sounds just like something he would say or would have said."" With the many real life shooters mentioned and those who were thinly cloaked with fictional names it is very difficult to cleanly define the fact from the fiction in Mr. Ross' excellent novel. I do feel it might have been added to by having foot notes indicating the 'facts' mentioned. Other than that Mr. Ross did an wonderful job of research in every aspect of his first work. He truely should be applauded for his efforts. Every Congressman, Senator, and membor of the legal community should be sent a copy and it should be required reading in every history class in every school in this Nation. I am looking forward to a sequel, maybe in the non-fiction section"
5,Wicked,"This is the import single for ""Cry"". It contains two tracks: the album version of ""Cry"" and a bside from the CRY album called ""Wicked"". ""Wicked"" is a song previously recorded by the group Unamerican. Faith's version is very pop and upbeat, with kicking guitars and cool vocals from her. ""Cry"" is one of my favorite songs, it's so emotional and raw. You can tell Faith is in this song completely, she sounds wonderful and expressive with her voice. This single is worth it for ""Wicked"", which is an excellent song that should have been on the album."
3,Creative Visualization book,It was a rehash of visualization classes that I took in the past. I was disappointed with it. It may be of use for others though.
4,use it or lose it..,"I had never heard of creative visualization before reading this book, it is something new and exciting to me the author tells you how by visualizing an outcome and believing in it, you can acually manifest it... It defenetely gave me more to think about......"
1,Don't fill out your Universal check yet..,This book is written with the authors own personal political worldview of even wealth distribution. There is nothing wrong with that except that within the context of this book it violates two principles of the law of attraction:1. It is a false belief that it is somehow inherently 'wrong' for me to desire wealth for myself.2. I cannot impose my own will on others.
1,utter rubbish and nonsense for the untalented and naive,"this book appeals to people without the requisite skills to succeed, and appeals to their wishful thinking."
