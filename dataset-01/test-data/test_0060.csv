4,entertaining history,"A fascinating fictionalised history: a collection of accounts of the liberation of Paris from the Nazis in 1944. Collins and Lapierre manage to string together a range of different narrative foci, using a kind of ficitonalised interior position in conjunction with documented history of the time. There are certain moments of privlege, and certain moments of exclusion, but a gripping and often touching read is the end result. You get the 'high end' of the story, with de Gaulle and Patton etc, but also many ordinary anecdotal stories, which are often the most interesting, and devastating. Many of the internal conflicts within the allied forces are laid bare for those that thought this was purely a 'them and us' kind of thing."
2,poor quality,Had trouble assembling the product out of the box. Then realized they packed two left upper arms and two left legs so there was no way to get it to work. After we had the right pieces it was still hard to get it together. After assembly it's not very straight and we need to prop it up. Wouldn't get this again.
2,"Okay, but not worth the money.",First let me say Amazon was very good with the problems with this unit. The first one came with two of the same arm. Amazon sent a new one and the second had a broken basket. Between the two I was able to put one together.The unit itself is just okay. The wire rack on the bottom is flimsy and will surely break if used as a bike rack. A plain plastic shelving unit would probably work better.
1,Read this first!,"Read the other reviews about poor quality, I wish I had. Poorly designed. Bolt holes don't line up and the bottom rack will require some ingenuity to get it together. Doesn't say where it was made but my guess is in China."
2,Would not buy unless you are or live with a handyperson,"I like the concept, but the product itself was very poor quality. It was very difficult to assemble. The holes in the tubing did not line up and we had to drill new holes to assemble the product. I can tell that it will probably only last this summer, then will end up in a landfill somewhere. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,"Wistful, romantic, funny Almodovar","I loved this!It marks the beginning of Almodovar's second golden period, with Live Flesh and All About My Mother. I dispute that it is rambling. It is no more rambling than All About My Mother... in fact I would suggest it is more coherent.The territory is classic Almodovar, but done with more poignancy than his earlier work. The frustrated confused lost romance novelist struggles through the chaos of her life to finally learn to believe in love, and the tango. Magic"
4,A great way to get all those recommended servings in!,"I really love this book. I have long been a fan of oven-roasted vegetables and found this book to be filled with unique recipes utilizing roasted vegetables. I did find that most of the recipes are heavy handed with the oil or butter. I have tried about six recipes (I reduced the oil, butter or other fats) and found all of them to be delicious. I especially loved oven-roasted green beans and cabbage with dill seed.My children love roasted vegetables. In fact, my six year-old can't get enough roasted root vegetables.This is a great book for those who already roast vegetables and want more inspiration or those who want to try it and need a place to start."
2,Too hard to find a recipe,"I looked through this book when it 1st arrived and found a few things I thought interesting. I happened to have a Delicata squash on hand and remembered that I'd seen a recipe that featured this squash in the book. So I looked in the index under Delicata and is says ""See Vegatables; Winter squash"". So I turned to Vegetables and no Winter Squash. I looked under W found the recipe under W.The Table of Contents lists starting page for a chapter, like side dishes. But when you go to that page the list of recipes at the beginning of the chapter does not show page numbers for the recipes. I really expect it to be easier than this to get to a specific recipe.The other big missing is nutrition information. While it does give number of servings, or at least a range like ""serves 4 to 6"", there is no additional information on calories or nutrition. All in all I am very disappointed from the standpoint of usability. The squash was good but not special."
4,high school can seem like hell.....great dark comedy,I'm not going to tell the plot or summary as most of the reviewers here already did. But I will say - hilarious...dark comedy not since Heathers has a film captured the exaggeration of high school life. I highly recommend.Neal DamianoFilm Critic[...]
3,Well...,I only tried to watch it once adn it didn't hold my attention. i guess it was okay but not amazing.
4,A good read for the thinking mind,"This is a really good book, but I needed to keep track of what universe it was in on paper! Its a complex storyline and it digs into both the characters and the plot really well. I didn't begin watching Voyager until the end of it's third season, and I found the history that kept this book cannon to the series really interesting (I didn't know our Harry was from another universe!). A good book to read, but keep some paper and a pen handy..."
4,Interesting and Rich,I really did enjoy this book and thought it to be a great example of the Star Trek Voyager series. It kept me on the edge of my seat just waiting to see what would happen to all of the people in the vaccum of space.....you can really get into this book!
2,Very interesting plot. Complete lack of closure.,"There are roughly 270 pages in this book. I was fasicinated with the 1st 269 pages. When the story ended I was left with, ""Wait a minute they ended too soon. Where's the rest of the story?"" The book set up too many plot lines on the planet surface that went unexplored. Such as the need for more amacolite. I thought they could have added about 10 more pages that found a reason, any reason, to go to the planet afterward and get their amacolite and see what normal life is like on the planet. Also don't read this book until you can find enough time to read it in one day. It is difficult to follow otherwise. This could be one of my favorites if there was a better ending."
3,"Great exam coverage, but contains errors","This book has some strong positive features, but also some negatives. On the positive, it covers the exam material quite well, and is easy to read. There's also questions at the end of each chapter to test your knowledge. As mentioned in previous reviews, the CD is great, with some tutorials and a sample exam (I don't know how close it is to the actual test.)For the negatives, the book contains some glaring errors. For example, in chapter 3 the author doesn't understand how Sysprep.exe works. It is NOT a cloning tool in itself, but instead it PREPARES the system for a third-party cloning tool. It does NOT create images, as listed on page 138. In chapter two there are some minor errors with the parameters for winnt.exe and update.exe (-s is a correct option for update.exe, but I don't think /slip is correct.)In summary, the exam coverage is great, but beware of errors!"
1,Read review by : cts@cts.pp.fi,"I fully agree that this book is a disgrace. I've read it, and still aren't sure what the ""minimum hardware requirements"" are for W2K Professional.Going to the Microsoft site doesn't help either. On one screen they talk about ""minimum requirement"" and on another the ""minimum recommended requirement"". This book is just as confusing.I wish I had seen the review by cti before I bought this useless, poorly edited mis-reference guide.I urge you not to buy it."
5,I used this book to pass the exam!,"As one of the series editors of this book, I decided to ""eat my own dogfood"" when it came time to study for the Win2k Pro exam. I used this book as my study guide and I slam-dunked the exam! This book gets into explaining the topics, not just giving you a outline and a mass of bulleted lists for you to memorize (who memorizes bulleted lists anyhow?).There are hundreds of questions in the book, and lots more on the CD. Also on the CD are CertCam Movies, where you can watch the procedures in over 40 of the exercises actually being performed on a Win2k Pro computer. Put that together with the quick review mode and audio tracks on the CD, and you'll find yourself with a Powerhouse study system.If I can do it using this book, so can you!"
5,Lush and delicious...enjoy it over and over,"I recorded this when it was first on PBS for viewing later. I liked it at first, but initially was impressed with the segments shot in the royal candy establishment. Talk about a droolfest!I kept replaying this program, especially for my mother who has Alzheimer's, and found this is an almost perfect music dvd. I was not familiar with Pretre, but now he's probably my favorite video conductor. Mom and I have decided to adopt him, permanently. Guess he'll have to bring the orchestra.I'd be content with total shots of the orchestra and ornate hall, but this production brings dramatic shots of the entire Danube river, from Germany to the Black Sea. Julie Andrews is the perfect new host, replacing the recently departed Walter Cronkite. Suppose one day I'll erase the program by mistake, and will order the DVD in earnest."
4,So Profetic,"I read this book ten years ago, and it stayed with me. These days the book is not so much fiction, it is completely likely, with the outcome simple math. The characters, and the struggle for equity are our history. It has been suggested that this book should be used in schools for social studies, womens classes, philosophy, and anything to rouse good conversation.Gives some fuel to the cloning/natural birth arguments as well."
5,Very Elegant!!,"I was very happy when I got this piece, it's a little smaller than I thought but it's just as pretty. It gives off a great sparkle in the light. The chain is thin but it works well with size of the pendant. I love it!"
2,Not what was expected.,I ordered this for my wife. It doesn't really look like the pictures. When it arrived the chain was knotted; it was difficult to fix this so that she could wear it.
3,star-crossed lovers . . .,I loved how this series of books connected together and revolved around each other. Intriguing story line. Good read.
5,Great coffee taste,"I really like Tully's French Roast Coffee. It has a dark, rich, smooth flavor without being bitter. I look forward to my first cup in the morning."
3,George W. Bush won't be using this tagline in any of his speeches,"From Smother Magazine smother.net:What you won't hear at the end of any future State of the Union speech is ""and God Bless Bloc Party"". But damn if Bloc Party and its legions of fans aren't chanting it. Released on the heels of ""Silent Alarm"" this DVD follows the band with a documentary and also a live show at Belfort. It's intriguing to see the personas behind the music. Fun-filled and choking with great dancey electronic rock, ""God Bless Bloc Party"" is a must-have for any true fan."
1,Not worth the dough!,"The ""documentary"" was horrible! It pretty much consisted of the camera following the band around outside or in a cab with songs from the band playing. The few times the band members spoke during the documentary they seemed like they were being forced to talk at gunpoint or something. The video coverage of the concert in LA was shoddy. The only redeeming thing about the dvd is the four or five song set played on the second portion of the dvd. Overall I was a very dissapointed Bloc Party fan!"
3,"Good performance, way too short.","This DVD is over so quick it leaves your head spinning.I saw these guys live twice on this first album, and I know they play more than this.I suppose not giving you much just makes you want to see more. If that was the plan, it worked."
4,A point I haven't seen made by others,"This is a generally good trailer. It works well, give my kid a smooth ride, and breaks down/sets up pretty easily.Two complaints.1) The buckles are a pain in the butt. They are pretty difficult to put on and take off.2) if you don't put the plastic cover over the front of the trailer, your kid will get dirt kick in his face from your bike tire. Now, of cours,e this would happen with any trailer, but the side windows are plastic only, so essentially, there's not much ventilation in this thing with the front plastic in place.That's really my only two gripes with the thing."
2,Consider safety recall,"things i do not like about this item: poor construction- the the hook that attaches the seatbelt to the receptacle came out because the strap fold that held the hook was not stitched properly. this could have been dangerous since the child could become unrestrained suddenly in the moving trailer. fortunately i noticed it while i was cleaning the trailer. this may qualify for a recall since it is the safety issue. i do not like the way the metal bar that connects to the bicycle is placed. the eccentric metal bar protrudes way ahead of the stroller to supports the front tire at its tip; no doubt it is stable but looks very ugly when you are using it as a stroller. the area to store/carry stuff is difficult to access.things i like: price, ease of storage- folds easily, color, shape"
4,Best Bang for Your Buck,I researched several bike trailers and purchased the InStep Quick N EZ Trailer based on other reviews. Barely feel the trailer when biking. Easy step by step assembly.
4,Excellent value,I was concerned about quality with the price so low but this is very well built and works as advertised. Highly recommend.
4,A great bargain!,"I was able to put this trailer together in less than 1 minute with no tools. The only required tool is the wrench to put the hitch on your bike. This is a great deal considering the price of a Burley Brand trailer. I do have to warn other customers this trailer is as a new KIA car is to a new Lexus (Burley). If you have kids that together weigh over 100 pounds I really recommend getting a bigger or higher quality trailer. The trailer works like a charm for what I intended it (taking my 18 pound dog on rides and buying groceries). The fabric is very cheap and I suspect it won't last that long even with proper care. Short of the fabric ripping the steal frame seems really solid. The trailer is easy to handle. If you are not mechanically inclined you can have someone else put the hitch on your bike, once its on its really easy to slide the trailer and safety pin in. The trailer is easy to fold flat and fits well in my subcompact's trunk."
4,Everything I needed,I give this book 4 stars. It has everything you need to know to install and record music CDS. I also learned more about making data CDS in this book than anything else I've read yet. A good pick.
5,Great for your little girl,"THis is such a nice movie for your little girl(s). My daughter watches it all the time along with Fairytopia, it is a nice movie and the toys are very nice also........"
5,Well done movies...,My daughter loves these barbie movies. I think they are well done and they do not carry anything inapproriate (like so many other movies that do). She pretends to be Eilina ALL the time!! Cant wait for Island Princess...
1,too good to be true,"As another review said, it is too good to be true.I got one and everything they said is true. The batteries are hard to remove. It doesn't turn off and the cap needs to be unscrewed to turn it off. The 7-speed functions don't work, it's either on or off.I thought it might just have a glitch and tried to work on it, but it is such a piece of junk there is no fixing it.I definitely recommend you spend a couple more dollars and get something better."
4,Favorite Men's Cologne,"I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and it is definitely my favorite men's cologne by far. Nice, big bottle lasts awhile and it smells so amazing."
5,A Fantastic High Energy Big Band Production,"""Fantazm is a fantastic high energy big band production with sizzling solos, great rhythm work and a brass section that delivers the big band sound with fire. Fantazm is a collection of standards and originals in the modern contemporary big band style. An enjoyable, powerful, bold and brassy big band recording that delivers a roaring musical experience and star performance from a great band."""
4,Texas Rangers,"James Lee Burke continues to produce thought-provoking and thoroughly readable fiction. Cimarron Rose weaves a fine tale with strong characters, good plotting and excellent first person narration. Drawing from his usual themes, Burke reflects on how the past informs the present, how men like hero Billy Bob Holland, (an ex-Texas Ranger) reconciles the violence in his life whilst trying to be decent as he raises a surrogate son in the form of a young mexican boy, (echoes here of Dave Robicheaux's adopted daughter Alafair). Cimarron Rose begins well and continues to grip the reader as a gallery of typical Burke villians(revolting pyscopaths, obnoxious federal agents, crooked law enforcement officers and rich spoilt, vicious brats) give hero Holland grief. Varying in style only slightly from Burke's earlier books, those who have enjoyed his work before should enjoy this book too."
3,i read edgar books and i wonder is this the best that year?,"the story began well, the reviews it had seemed to make it appear like it really was a good work of fiction. well its good, i just wasnt convinced that it was the winner coz on the last part or past halfway of the book it seemed to have lost steam, the only saving grace was the courtroom drama of billy bob and his son which isnt that exciting really. anyway its good in its own right and i havent read his other book ""black cherry blues"" yet' so i guess the award giving body still have a chance to prove to me if the award was given out of favorit--- or theres no other better choice that year."
4,So freakin' cute!,"I'm a perfectly sane adult, but I still watch cartoons, mostly on the Cartoon Network's adultswim. I've enjoyed the complexity of the characters from the 'Full Metal Alchemist' animated series for some time, and I really love Al. He's usually so optimistic and caring, but he does have a nasty little dark side that comes out occasionally. This plush toy is the innocent Al, holding a kitten he found. It isn't a great piece artistically, but it fully captures the spirit of Al & the little things count, like the tail on the kitten & Al's leg-pouch. I probably wouldn't recommend it for especially young children (or as a chew toy for pets) because it has a lot of separate pieces sewn on, but for a collector or an older kid who isn't going to 'play rough' with him, it's great."
1,clutter,"This was one of the worst books on child rearing I have ever read. It was merely a disorganized data dump of commonly known ideas. Nothing original here. This author has no educational credentials and is obviously not a practicing child psychologist. Nothing memorable or helpful here.I recommend books on PET (Parent Effectiveness Training) which offer the way(s) to connect on an emotional level with your child. PET is not just about controlling behavior, which is Bonnie Maslin's focus, but gives the child the gift of understanding, the most important first step in building a solid foundation for life-affirming communication and cooperation."
4,Solid little camera,"I like the size of this camera -- perfect for dropping in a pocket on a trip. It takes pretty good, even some great pictures. Functionally, my only complaint is that the zoom isn't quite as good as I would like, but then again, I knew the specs coming in. I don't use the software so I can't comment on that. I'm a Mac user and iPhoto does what I need it to do, so if you have PhotoShop or iPhoto you probably won't use the software that is bundled with it either."
5,This is the Ferrari of pizza wheels,"Get it, you won't be dissappointed. Its very slick looking and well constructed. The only note I would add is, Like Ferrari's it takes time to clean properly."
3,The Good and the Bad,"We purchased this pizza wheel because the one we'd had for years was getting very rusty. We checked out many and settled on this one because it had the size we wanted, it looked well-designed and substantial, and it had very good reviews.The good news is that this pizza wheel lived up to our expectations in all ways except one: After only two times in the dishwasher, it has begun to rust on the parts that connect the wheel to the handle. The product description, as well as what's stated on the packaging, labels this stainless steel wheel as being dishwasher-safe.We have decided to keep it. We washed it well by hand to remove the rust and will wash it by hand from now on, treating it like a good knife. Our reasoning is that this rusting is likely to be a problem on all pizza wheels, so we might as well keep this otherwise high-quality one and just be sure to dry it quickly and thoroughly after washing by hand."
1,Started out great.......,"My husband gave me this expensive piece of kitchenware for Christmas. I used it four times and was very, very impressed. Invited friends for dinner the fifth time. The item did not seal, the meat was badly burned on the bottom. Now, we'll see how true the stories go about getting it repaired. Wish I hadn't given away my trusty stovetop pressure cooker!"
2,Ours caught FIRE!!!,"We had the Farberware unit 2 years, then it caught fire. Flames shot out from the front of the unit near the control panel. We loved it for the first 2 years--nothing else on the market compares. However, reading the reviews of others it appears the electronics is a real problem in these units. 2 years ago we paid $99, and now it is $199 and the quality of the electronics definitely needs to improve."
1,Did not last,"I purchased this exact cooker--but it had the Farberware name on it. I really liked it - it made great dinners. However one day it just stopped working. I tried to contact Farberware w/ no response. I contacted QVC, where I purchased it and they said they also could not help. This is a lot of coin for something that is only guaranteed a year and I will NOT be buying another one--no matter whose name is slapped on it, until they give a BETTER GUARANTEE."
2,Nice watch for the money but alarm faulty,Nice looking watch works well except for the alarm which I never quite got working well despite a lot of help from USA Mall which is a very accomodating retailer.
4,Nice watch!,"Really not a lot to say! I had this watch over a year now.. no problems thus far. I don't wear it everyday, but when I do, I get complements. Nice Watch!"
3,Pyrex 1 cup measurer with lid.,"I would really rather have had a smaller 1 cup like they used to make. This is more like a 1.5 cup measurer without the marks for the extra half cup. I do, however, like having the lid."
4,Written on Glass,"I thought this was a pretty good book. Well written and descriptive. I love England and it certainly portrayed the time of WWII for the two families in involved, a pretty bleak time. It moves along steadily but isn't a page turner in terms of not being able to put it down. It is one of those books you enjoy when you are reading and can go back to when you feel like it."
3,"sacrilege, but ""heaven can wait:"" is better","i liked this, but (i know this is not legal) i really enjoyed the warren beatty remake alot more. sorry folks."
5,All Day Al,"If you could only have one album from the man that mends broken hearts this is the joint to have it incorperates many of his greatest and most popular hits with extended versions of lesser known songs into one compact album, producing a ""live"" album that reflects al green at his very best. As a child growing up my mom would play Al from sun up too sun down I couldn't stand the man lol. It just took me awhile to understand his messages of love in his songs. Al thank you for being their when my mom needed you!"
4,All you need is some wine and women,"Just pop this CD in and feel that smooth 70's funk wash over you. Suddenly your transported into a plush velvet and pleather filled world. This CD just screams cool. Al just knows what to do, and heh why mess with a good thing? Tracks like ""Belle"" and ""Love and Happiness"" just feel good. The reason it only received 4 stars is the ending of every song is huge. It's very 70's and kind of gets annoying when you were enjoying such a beautiful ballad. Other than that just buy this CD slip into something comfortable, sit your ladyfriend (or manlyfriend) down and well you know..."
3,When Success Goes to Your Head,"I thought this Al Green performance in Tokyo, circa 1978, while better than many soul/r&b; singers, was rather self-indulgent and for me, disappointing.It lacked the focus, power and conviction of Otis Redding Live In Europe, or James Brown at the Apollo, granted they are different singers than Al Green. It's a rather loose, meandering affair that may have translated better if it was the accompanying soundtrack on a DVD.Green hit his peak earlier in the '70s and was plateauing out at the time this concert was recorded. Notice the new Rock Star 'do, noticeable bling-bling and clothes. In a few years, Al would renounce all this materialism to become a man of the cloth.It's a good performance, okay, but it was not what I expected. Go pull out Al's earlier studio albums and cut through the live indulgences and vocal theatrics."
1,A gradual build-up of suspense would've been better.,"""SILENCE IS GOLDEN"" was the warning issued to the new associate history professor Sarah Cummings, who just started at Sprucewood College. When Officer Jake Wolfe hits on her at an off-campus hamburger joint, Sarah outwardly freezes him out, but inwardly goes into a state of full-blown panic! But Jake won't take ""no"" for an answer.Overall, the story is a complete waste of time & money. Jake's character lacked depth and maturity. I also couldn't believe how fast Sarah 'melted' for Jake--like somebody did a complete 180 on her personality between one chapter and the next!This is Ms. Hohl's first book in her Wolfe Brothers Quartet. Don't miss Wolfe Watching, Wolfe Wanting & Wolfe Wedding--they're all a distinct improvement over this one."
3,Needs a stronger spring,"This would be a great clip, if only the spring was stronger and or a bigger undercut on the underside of the clip. On more than one occassion my phone has come off my belt when I brush against something or stoop down. I have a rather large smart phone (HTC Inspire), so would probably work better on a smaller phone."
1,Don't waste your money,"This program has the worst user interface I've ever seen in my life, and plenty of bugs to go with it.The video conversations are a great idea but they are poorly executed and there are too few of them anyway.The rest of the program vaguely resembles a reference guide but it's to cumbersome to be of much practical use."
4,So far so good!,I am in the process of reading this book but so far so good! It is flowing and easy to get into. I am happy that I purchased it. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Jodi Picoult's writings. I received this book in a very timely manner and was happy with the product when it arrived!! I would purchase from this seller again!
1,Insult to a Woman's Intelligence,"After a couple of recommendations to read this author, I randomly picked Picture Perfect. It was so obvious Picoult wanted you to somehow empathize with the pathetic Alex Rivers. I did not feel sorry for him at all, nor for Cassie. What this story was, was a study in such sickly sweet sentimentality about abuse disguised as true love. What sorry people Cassie and Alex were. This book was really disappointing. The last thing this world needs is to glamorous domestic violence and spousal abuse."
4,Good Read,This addresses the battered woman syndrome explaining why some continue to stay in these relationships.
5,Great,The book came when it was supposed to and it was in the condition that was mentioned on the website.
2,"First book by this author, not sure I'd read another","To sum things up, this book could have been cut in half (at least!) and gotten the same point across. I almost gave up on this book a few times, but for some reason kept reading. The ending was okay but everything leading up to it was long-winded. This was my first book by Jodi Picoult and I honestly don't think I would read another by her, sorry to say."
2,"Long, unrealistic, and all over the place","I had high hopes for this book, but it lost me in the first few chapters. There wasn't one likable character in the entire book. I thought much of it too far fetched to even be in the realm of believable. Between Indians, Africa, Anthropolgy, Hollywood, Maine, and the Bayou, there was just too much going on."
5,Worth every penny,"If you know a horse crazy kid, buy them this book and they'll cherish it forever. The cover image is absolutely stunning, and just a taste of what is inside. Beautiful photography, moving writing and inspiring quotes. It's not for little kids, but a horse crazy girl about 9 or 10 will devour it just as much as that horse crazy 40 something. Even if you horses aren't a big part of your life, animal lovers will enjoy it just the same. The included DVD is just icing on the cake. When I was a horse obsessed 10 year old, I would cut pictures of horses out of magazines, newspapers, or anything I could get my hands on. This is the book I wish I had back then."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL RELEASE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.,THIS DVD IS A CHOPPED UP VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL THEATRE RELEASE OF THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. I HATE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS MOVIE.THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT A LIGHT COMEDY BUT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WAS MORE SERIOUS. THE QUESTION I ASK IS WHY DID THEY ALTAR THIS MOVIE? THEY NEED TO RELEASE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE.
5,I'll Plant My Own Tree!,"This movie came out when I was a sophomore in a now defunct Catholic high school. A group of us played hooky and went to the also now long gone movie theatre on 34th Street and for that time, we sat in absolute shock at the language we heard and the fact that Patty Duke actually had breasts!!!!! This isn't such a great movie to be seen alone--one needs the ambience of fellow D- cheese lovers to move it along with calls and responses to key lines and songs in the film. As Babara Parkins once told a crowd of enthusiasts--""I know why you love this movie...because it's so bad!"""
2,God-awful music and false eyelashes galore!,"If you're planning on taking this one seriously, don't bother watching it. My husband DESPISED it. I got very tired of Dionne Warwick's infatiguable warbling, and the rest of the songs (the first half is nearly a musical) are dreadful too.If you can get past that, it's entertaining brain candy. I cracked up over Patty Duke grumbling about ""boobies"" and that *she* made it without any.It's over acted, mushy, and a plain bad movie, but I did get a kick out of al the 60's styles."
5,Cult classic,"""Valley of the Dolls"" ranks in reviewer's books as one of the WORST films of all time. How untrue they were when they made their critiques. True, it can never be said that ""Dolls"" is an EXCELLENT picture, but it holds some credibility - and if not for the acting, then for the music. With all do respect to Dionne Warwick - great vocalist that she is - her warbling of the theme through the actual film is okay (much better than the single/radio version) but here on this classic soundtrack, it is replaced by Dory Previn. Previn, who also co-wrote the score, has a sweet soprano range that is more effective (especially if you know the film and story) and would have worked better in the film than Warwick. The arrangement of the theme, presented here, is also far superior to the single version. The other music, conducted by the famed John Williams, is excellent and should be part of any CD collection."
5,"Too much of everything, and I loved it!","""Sparkle, Neely, sparkle!"" ""Neely, you're ob-nox-ious."" ""Let 'em droop."" This classic is filled with memorable lines, memorable clothes, memorable hair. And all are a scream. It's a cavalcade of camp, one of the funniest most unintentionally funny films of all time. While in 1967 they clearly thought they were making a faithful adaptation of a bestseller (kind of a sixties version of ""The Firm"" or ""The DaVinci Code"") in 2006 the producers of this 2 disc set know exactly what they have on their hands and have treated it accordingly. The extras are terrific. My favorite is the commentary by Barbara Parkins and the inspired/inevitable Ted Casablanca from E!, who took his nom de plume from Neely's second husband. Their banter about the casting (and ""doability"") of actor/singer Tony Scotti are worth the price of the DVD set alone. Is it good film making? Of course not. Is it a nonstop delight? Well, if you get this sort of thing, this is the gold standard."
1,WORST adaptation of a book i've ever seen.,"The novel, Valley of the Dolls, entertained me as much as a modern day soap opera, only better. However, the film version lacks explanation, depth, character development, and a running plot line. Had i not read the book first, i would have been totally lost and confused. The characters are never fully introduced, their relationships are never developed for more than a minute... overall, this film is just lacking. Do yourself a favor, and take the time to read the novel and SKIP the film.And why is it... that each time someone gives a negative review of an item, people always say it's not helpful??? Not agreeingg with a review, and not finding it helpful, is totally different!I'm just being honest...Try the book!"
3,CONTAINS SOY NOW,"Just an FYI, as of 3/2012, these crackers now contain SOY. they didn't used to, but they do now. We ordered a 12-pack only to find the change. This web site doesn't list soy as an ingredient, but Sesmark's web site shows the new ingredient list: brown rice, expeller pressed safflower oil, salt and soybean tocopherols.[...]"
1,Dumb goofy novelty song from a genuinely talented band,"Fleming and John have such a large amount of talent that it tanks to have to sit by and watch them market a worthless novelty song as if it was indicative of their songwriting abilities. This is by far the weakest song on their album, with dorky background vocals, weak groove, and horrid lyrics. Especially horrible since they're supposedly a Christian band, which is supposed to tout love and grace, not judgmentalism, vanity, and shallowness. If they want to be succesful in the long run, they should push their A material, like the first track, ""I'm so small."""
5,A very helpful program,I am trying to learn to speak spanish at home and I find this program to be a great tool for learning to pronounce words and sentences. I listen to the native speaker while watching the sentence on the screen then speak the sentence into the microphone provide with the program. The computer uses a voice pattern to show me how my sentence compares to the native speaker. I can slow the speaker down if needed and I can compare various aspects of my recorded sentence with the native speaker. There are games and other helpful activities included with the program. I really enjoy this program
2,I don't recommend this product.,"I do not recommend this product to anyone. It contains incorrect translations. For example, it says that veintisiete is 26. Veintisiete is 27. It contains other errors, too. In one section of the program, I found Spanish in the box where the English translation was suppose to be. I also had problems with the sound. When I clicked on the button to slow the speed of the dialogue, the sound was distorted. It's a shame that the software has these errors, because otherwise, it is a very good program. It teaches in a very well organized manner. It has a section on grammar and the letter sounds for beginners and is also designed for intermediate and advanced students. But unless you want to keep a dictionary nearby and make sure that each translation is correct, then I recommend finding another product."
3,"Intergalatic diplomacy, Doctor Who-style","An interesting Pertwee episode that finds the Doctor and Jo thrown into a intersteller diplomatic conference plagued by mysterious murders. A solid, if unspectacular episode. DW fans will enjoy seeing David Troughton, the son of the second Doctor (Pat) as the king of Peladon."
1,hmmmm,"video is ok. but like another person wrote, its only really good for background playing rather than for learning.if u want to learn something mr haase's video is better suited.[titled massage with confidence]"
3,Need to Return this item,I already have a problem with this item. One of the small inside diamonds fell out and is lost. My wife noticed three days after Christmas. Other than that ok with purchase.
1,This book was very slow-moving and dull.,"I was assigned to read a novel in my Junior year Dual Enrollment English class. For some reason, I chose the Scarlet Pimpernel, mainly because it was about 8 times shorter than Tom Jones or David Copperfield. I couldn't get into the book at all, and in fact, I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I'll try to read it again someday, but I doubt it. My advice? Read something else, like Tom Jones, where there are atleast Cliff Notes or a Movie about it. Maybe because everyone here has given this book 4 and 5 stars, it seems I have no clue what I'm talking about. I tried to give it a chance, but I simply could not follow the reading. If you are willing to give this dull and slow book a fair chance, by all means, go for it."
5,A great story!,"Intrigue, adventure...romance...what else does a great novel need to be just perfect?... I highly recommend this book to those who are looking for good and entertaining reading...Since the begging of the story you will be captivated by the mysterious character known as the Scarlet Pimpernel, who together with his loyal followers risks his life to save French aristocrats from a certain death at the Guillotine. This character knows of disguise and intrigue...but struggles with a broken heart. Pride and misunderstandings will separate him from the woman he loves...I won't say more, so you can discover the rest of the story by yourself!Another good thing about this book is that since the story occurs in 1792 you also get the opportunity to experience some of the political and social issues present in France and England during this period.You will certainly enjoy this book!"
3,Quiet is the New Loud,"A good compilation (serious!) joining some of the best indie bands of the last years, ""A Quiet Revolution"" is a sleeper effort but a whole lot better one than most of the overrated mainstream junk around. For a double album, this record is quite good, delivering a collection of subtle, captivating and low-key music that should get more attention. Sometimes it`s just too quiet, though, and a couple of more electronic-oriented songs wouldn`t be a bad idea, since most of the tracks are acoustic. Highlights include work by Badly Drawn Boy, Wheat, Moby, Goldfrapp, and Mull Historical Society, while Everything But The Girl, Embrace and I Am Kloot present filler moments. Personally, I would add a few names here, such as Gomez, Ladytron, Sparklehorse, JJ72, Air or The Experimental Pop Band, but this is still a fine selection nonetheless.A breath of fresh air."
3,This is more oriented to Brazilean Portugeuse,"For anyone planning a trip to Brazil, this is a good program to get. However, for anyone interested in learning continental Portugeuse (i.e. European dialect) this module is not as useful. For a non-native speaker, the Brazilean dialect often seems faster and more melodic than the language spoken in Portugal. The continental language is often slower and more pronounced, or annunciated. Overall, the package is good with useful interactive activities. However, the package should be labelled ""Brazilean Portuguese""."
4,A surprising push for independance,"Upon losing her poor-paying job and with both her sisters getting married and moving away, Julia is in financial troubled waters. The sisters sell their home and split the proceeds, leaving Julia with no career and no roof. With no lack of courage or skills, she is determined to support herself, without the help of Professor Gerard Van der Mersh. He, however, has other plans fo their future together.A classic Betty Neels."
1,Not enough,"I was hoping that a fly fishing video would have more in the ways of tips and instruction - more than the scenic vistas and close up shots in outdoor TV programs. Well, there's more tips/instruction, but not nearly enough, as far as I'm concerned. The videos are still heavy on fishing shots, light as far as I'm concerned on information and advice. I guess, though, that that is what many video viewers may want.My suggestion for more informational content focused consumers would be to pick up a couple of good books, such as David Hughes instructional books ""Tactics for Trout"" or ""Reading the Water."""
2,DVD Review (from a pro guide),"Good stuff, but didn't feel that new.Tobe honest, it was not on the entertainment level of the filmi was given for my birthday from HowardFilms.com (""Rising Tide""):that film was a rush - of information, culture, story and pro cinema....strategies was nice, but this thing rocked. not like anything you've seen. believe me.i like ""strategies"" as a concept, but i think i felt it was not pushing the envelope that much. and it is about time someone did."
2,"Nice thought, but...","pleasant, but not a homerun...felt a bit stiff.i applaud the effort. and, if you are in the intermediate leveland need a psychological reason to make you moves, i think this will be better than if you are a longterm fly fisher(person)."
1,Poor Oppie,"Poor Oppenheimer gets lost in this clumsy political screed. While all good biographies are rich in background, this one often strays far beyond any meaningful relevance to its subject. Why should a book about a man who died in 1967 repeatedly refer to 9-11 and George W. Bush? The leftwing worldview of the author is on display here with all the sublety of, well, an atomic blast."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This was the worst developed movie I've ever watched. Bad acting, even worse editing, and very hard to follow. There are far better real-life stories out there about life after life. The Bio channel has interesting first-hand experiences from real people about signs from those who have crossed over."
5,Excellent and Quirky!,"This movie came highly recomended to me as a sleeper, with excellent acting in it. Robert Duvall is amazing and Bill Murry was such a hoot! The chemistry between the two of them was wonderful! It was funny and surprising - not a big Hollywood blockbuster, but the type of movie that I want (and now have) in my personal collection. If you like films that are quirky, and very well done, then this movie is for you!"
5,Get Low,"Great movie, one of Bill Murray's best performances, not to mention Robert Duvall's great performance in this. He plays a perfect mountain man. Funny and entertaining. Really enjoyed this movie."
4,Get Low,What a great movie.It's a sleeper.Just as good as love song for Bobby Long. It is slow but worth it.One of Duval's best performances
3,Atlantis,"A beautifully filmed piece, I did expect much more though, only watched it once and that was enough."
1,Never received ordered item,"I never received the ordered item, but a charger instead. They failed to respond to my email."
5,Love it.,Love Dannys music. I now about Dannys music since I was a teenager. My sister and I used to listen to his music and I always wanted to meet him but was impossible because of his fame..
4,Fun Potty Book,"After reading the book and watching the video of ""Prudence and the Potty"" with my oldest daughter, it was time for something new and up-to-date for my second child. Leafing through various potty books, this one caught my eye as having something for everyone. The children are of many races with neat ethnic names, and there's probably at least one page that each reader can relate to. Ours was the one with the big sister sitting on a toilet across from her little sister on a training potty. We've promised our daughter that once she's potty-trained, we'll put her picture in the back cover (there's a special place). Great incentive and lots of fun."
2,dumb,arrived in condition described and timely. but just a dumb book. even my 2 year old doesnt like it. dont waste money on it... it does not inspire potty training.
1,Beware,"Beware of limitations on the model years of vehicles this product can be used on. No where in the online sales pitch does it say for use on domestic or import vehicles for the years 1980 to 1998. However, it does say that on the package. Very disappointing. Most cars today are newer than those years and I expected the tester to cover at least to the 2005 models."
1,Not Funny,"I find Bush hilarious, but this calendar is not funny at all. It's essentially a compilation of minor grammatical errors (wrong verb tenses, mis pluralizations, etc). Very disappointing...and a complete waste of money."
5,"Meat, not Hollywood Glitz","The book behind the Hollywood movie ""Extraordinary Measures"". John Crowley is a driven man - trying to find a find and then develop a cure for Pompe, a lysosomal disease that two of his children are terminally ill with.The book is the complete story and shares some of the reality the movie leaves out."
3,No counties !,This atlas has a lot of extraneous pages of info in it which in my opinion should have been left out to make room for the counties. You will never be sure of what county you are in with this atlas. There are no county outlines or county names anywhere in the atlas. It is a shame because it is a nice size for carrying around.
3,Not the best Brenda Jackson,"This was a good book to read while on the commute train. It was light and foo foo. It didn't take thought to keep up with the characters. I know it was a Harlequin, but it was not Brenda's usual. I kept having to look at the front picture to make sure it was a black woman she was talking about. Her other books (the Madaris family) are wonderful and I'm always glad to see which family member she will write about. I really hope she will have Valentine Kiss reissued."
3,Velma's weakness.,The wig is great although shorter than the picture. The material in the skirt and top is flimsy and felt like. It's okay if it's not something you plan on wearing over and over. I didn't care for the glasses - they were huge! I wore my own.
4,Italian now and later,"My 50 year old husband decided he wanted to try and learn to speak some Italian. I bought Italian now for Christmas and he's really enjoying it. However, I was shocked to find my three sons, ages, 11, 10 & 8 also love it. It's turned into a family fun time trying to see who can enunciate the words better on the meter scale."
4,"Good Song, but the one remix......","I like Thunderpuss, I do. But why did they remix this song the way they did?? It makes the song too long, I prefer the five minute extended album remix, I like her laugh part in the long remix, but that's pretty much it. The Thunderpuss remix is too long and repetitive and the overall lyric is uninspired. I miss Jennifer and I think my expectations of this single was just too high. Four stars for the bomb vocal."
3,thats not cool,just one question where is his hair is that what amazon does to there fig god help jakks if they saw this. (word of edvice dont break the figs what they done to you amazon.)
5,Refreshing,"So refreshing to hear that Jesus loved us all and that God loves us all. I have never been able to embrace organized religion because of the guilt and shame, the rigidity of the rules, the waiting for joy in heaven. I want to be happy and experience love right here on Earth. This guidebook will help you find the joy and comfort you deserve as a child of God."
2,What a disappointment!,"After the first single was released, I was so excited to go out and buy her CD when it came out! However, after listening to the tracks on Amazon, I re-thought that decision. I think all of the songs leave much to be desired. What is it with artists who attempt to lure the public to buy their CD by releasing an awesome first single? Gwen did it with ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby,"" and Jen's doing it with ""Rebirth."" I LOVE ""Get Right,"" but the rest of the album doesn't sound promising, so they won't be getting my money. Just a tip for people considering buying the album - listen to the track samples first. If you like the majority of them, THEN buy the album. Otherwise, just stick to iTunes, and pay for the songs you like."
1,YUCK!,"This cd contains alot of fillers, which is similar to her 2nd album, jlo. The songs are all plain stupid, and they are extremely boring, and dull, and poorly sung/written. Do not buy this album. It is highly annoying. I would reccomend the emancipation of mimi, by mariah carey."
1,GOOD GOD!!!!,"If I could give this ridiculous album 0 stars, I would. I cannot believe this woman actually has a recording contract and with Sony/Epic no less. Same old stuff from Ms. Bronx. The I am a homey from hood routine is so played out, especially from a 35-year old woman. When is she going to get a different act?she should be embarrassed!!!! Don't waste your money folks. I am sure only the female teenagers are going to purchase this crap!!!!"
2,REBIRTH BY J LO IS A LAME ATTEMPT AT MUSIC,"J Lo's new album ""Rebirt"" has some interesting beats, but overall is a very weak album. It's basically a rehash of the best dance music with J Lo providing the singing.Which brings me to this point: SHE CANNOT SING!! Her voice is very limited and it shows in this album.Save your money - - -buy Gwen Stefani or anyone else. This album is NOT A GOOD BUY!!!!"
3,Rebirth,"Okay, this album was really not that bad. Madonna is not all great of a singer either, but her music is great. I liked it. There were a few songs on there that I have to wonder what was JLo thinking but for the most part it's okay and easy on the ears."
4,This is album is hot.,"I don't consider myself a fan of Jennifer Lopez but I have checked out her recent work. I would say this album is one of her best since her 1999 release, On the 6. After listening to the leak on MTV, I had to make a review on here for the album.But I first would like to address, for some (reviewers) to come on here and criticize her for far more than (music)work that is a little unfair. Also, some state that she is the reason why sales are so low.That's ludacris, the only reason sales are so low today is because people today are too lazy to go out and buy the albums instead they rip (illegally) it from somewhere else or blatantly don't want to spend any money.In my opinion, if your a Jennifer Lopez fan, you'll love this album. But if you're not a fan, I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it as well. I love 10 of the 12 songs on this album, therefore I gave this album a 4 1/2 stars. I didn't give a 5 because everyone has room for improvement.Buy the album (a non J-Lofan)"
2,Ouch,"What happened on this one? Jennifer Lopez has never been an innovative artist but always manages to release a disc full of fun dance songs. This one does not deliver. ""Get Right"" was promising, but unfortunately there's really nothing else here that offers anything. The new single ""Hold You Down"" with Fat Joe is a rip-off of that other J. Lo/rapper collaboration ""All I Have"" with LL Cool J from the superior This Is Me...Then disc. ""Cherry Pie"" may not be a strong cut but is the only other song it sounds like she's having fun on. Maybe that would regenerate this album's sales and give it a rebirth, but probably not. Dig a little deeper next time."
1,what a dissapointment!,"OK, so here I am writing a review for the J lo's recent album. All i can say is that it sucks!!!! Get Right was a catchy song the first time i heard it but then it just got boring. The rest of the album are just stupid slowjams. Please don't buy it! I did and i got dissapointed."
1,IT'S SO SIMPLE: THERE'S NO VOICE,"What an awful album, the first single ""Get Right"" has a catchy beat, but when she starts singing the song goes so bad, it's not a good album, the worse of 2005, she's not a singer, Jennifer has no voice.If you want real voice and real music:- ***THE ALWAYS IMITATED BUT NEVER DUPLICATED: Mariah Carey***- ***THE SEXY Janet Jackson***"
3,Not Bad,"I bought this CD when it came out, and I have a few favorite tracks. The album as a whole is listenable, but it doesn't really seem to be jennifer lopez at her best. Not so much a crowd pleaser. ""Get Right"" gets a little annoying with that horn. Lyrics are sub-par, but her voice is at a fitting tone. She doesn't overdo it.As for the Mariah episode....it was obviously a deliberate act against Mariah, but on Tommy Mottolla's part. I don't think it was in Jennifer's agenda to take ideas from Mariah.As for the Usher episode, who knows what that was about. Maybe she's not so much involved in her own production.now that i've heard this, i'm curious to hear Mariah's ""Emancipation of Mimi."" There's good buzz surrounding that.if anything, Jenny looks really good in the CD booklet. ;0)"
1,Trash,"Her last cd This is me...then was boring and bad, but this is terrible and horrible. We dont need trash like J.Lo. we need good artist who can sing!"
3,She's not getting any better...she's actually weaker...,"I consider myself a pop music fan and aficionado...and I thought Jennifer Lopez's first albums had some great pop songs on them. I still think her duet with Marc Anthony, ""No Me Ames"", is one of the great undiscovered singles...especially in it's uptempo incarnation.Her last album was boring, and so is this one.There's no fire, no spunk, no energy...it's curiously flat. Where IS she? Having seen her in other arenas (Her ""Inside The Actor's Studio episode"" was terrific...she's funny, intelligent, quick-witted and dynamic...) I know there's MORE to her.I kept trying to find something that would make me return to this disc more than once, and that would only be the video portions...... the DVD side doesn't have a DVD-A recording, merely an ""enhanced"" stereo. Ho-hum.Maybe my expectation are too high for her, but I was really disappointed..."
1,Slick production but same old voice,"Not much of a departure on this new CD. Lots of slick production and big cameo appearance from big hip-hop stars. However, the voice is still weak...bordering on just bad. You would think all that over-produced arrangements would help out but to no avail. Who is she targeting this cd to?? I think jlo really ought to look in the mirror and start to realize the same formula over and over again is plain tired. Man, come up with something remotely original. Maybe on the next cd, it will be all beats and sound with no voice...now, that's a novel approach."
2,i only heard 2 songs so that's y this gets 2 stars,da way i rate ablum of artist is that is might b good and worthy of a decent rating while most of jlo's songs are usually good that when i give it a good rating if most of her songs that i heard or saw aren't good from da ablum doesn't get a good ratin da songs i heard and saw was get right was 1 of jlo better songs to date and hold us down was actually not bad either it had a very nice beat during da winter season but it didn't make sense da video y she would wear heels sandles and it was 25 degrees outside who do she think she is fooling no one that probably y it was on da countdown because of her foolish footwear dressin but i think she was tryin to do something a female hasn't done yet if she makes more songs from da album that i enjoy this album will get a higher ratin
2,2 stars for effort,"Jennifer Lopez is always getting hype tat she cant sing. In my opinion she is an ok singer. This cd is ok, its a good try. Get Right is definately in my opinion the best song. The beat on tat song gets me all the time. As for all the other songs they are just ok. They arent great and dont play out to the title REBIRTH. If your a fan of Jennifer Lopez get the cd, you may enjoy it more than us who arent huge fans. For those not such a huge fan and not sure bout buying the cd but like her two hits get right and the one with fat joe, then download the songs<--- Dont get the album........"
2,Typical,"Hey, this doesn't stray too far away from the J-Lo formula:Take songs and riffs already produced, change the lyrics, tweak the beats, and make it your own.Some people like this kind of music. Yes, I will give credit, some of the songs will make you dance, but still, this is boring and gets tiring after a while.J-Lo fans should be happy. Others not so much. The only thing I have to say is if J-Lo thinks this album is going to pull her out of the tailspin her career has taken, she better think again."
1,Same Ole Same,"J-Lo has the same formula on all of her Albums.I liked ""Get Right"" because it was a Smart way to come back. but Her vocal Range is so low it's like someone yelling through a Tuna Can&you can't even hear the echo of it.i will never knock Her Hustle because She is 6 years deep into Her Music Career&at just 35 she could possible have another 10-15 year run as a Pop Vocalist which means more of what we have gotten from her. She gets the kind of cuts that Mariah,Whitney,Christina should be getting but can't.i always got the feeling that music for her was a Hobby&If it worked than cool.Her Producers&Modern Technilogy have been able to create some catchy slick Material that has worked&at a time or two I have dug a few things,but being on the real it's still all about the Visual with me when i think of J-LO. splices of the tracks& on mute."
4,Ashamed to love it!,"I know that it is not an album that is one to remember, but the songs are great to listen to and ""Cherrie Pie"" has become one of my favorite J.LO songs. I enjoy it and recommend it.It is what it is!"
1,i'd give it 0 but there's no 0 star option,"this woman wants to be mariah carey, she is such an imitator, and a bad one at that, one thing she will never has is a voice, she cannot sing one note, the producers have to stare at her ass to distract themselves from the fact they have to listen to her ""voice"", alot of the reviews state oh god her voice is so powerful on this song, maybe i listened to the wrong one but thats highly doubtful considering every song is like having colonic irrigation. do yourself a favour and don't buy this tripe, she can't sing, she's fat.her voice is like listening to my cat run her nails down a piece of a wood. and why doesn't she do herself a favour and rename her album the emancipation of j lo. wonder where she got the title re-birthfrom,"
3,Something's Not Quite Right....,"I am so not feeling this cd. I know Jennifer's voice has always been light, but my goodness the songs sound really weak here. I can't just give it one star because I think she is talented, but I was expecting something more considering the fact the cd is titled ""Rebirth"". The personality her music used to have is just not there. I'll take ""I'm Real"" over ""Get Right"" anyday. If you buy it, don't expect to be wowed, because it's very likely you won't even listen to it twice. Maybe next time Jen..."
4,Very under-rated...,"I was never a huge Jennifer Lopez fan, and when I got this CD, I was dissapointed. But after a few listens, I learned to love almost all the songs. Although it has a good share of filler, it has it's high points.1) Get Right - 10/10 one of the best songs on the CD2) Step Into My World - 10/10 great, sexy, vibe3) Hold You Down - 10/10 good slow song, but fat joe dissapoints4) Whatever You Wanna Do - 10/10 a different, jazzy style5) Cherry Pie - 10/10 best one on the cd, with a prince, rock vibe6) I Got U - 10/10 great melody and lyrics7) Still Around - 7/10 bland, too happy8) Ryde Or Die - 10/10 grew on me, could be a little better9) I, Love - 10/10 love the percussion10) He'll Be Back - 10/10 love the flute-ish sound in the background11) (Can't Believe)This Is Me - 7/10 boring slow song12) Get Right Remix - 10/10 not too much different from the original"
1,"I didn't buy it, I listened on MTV.com","Artists need to be really confident with their work if they are going to put their entire album online for people to listen to before they buy it. It worked for Usher, but it screwed Pink and Madonna. Now it will hopefully put an end to Ms. Lopez's ""singing"" career. The first single, Get Right, is horrible, not only can't she sing, but the beats are terrible. They added Fabolous to cover up the empty spots in the song. The rest of the songs are just as bad, bad singing, bad overproduction. I think her past successes were due to the catchy dance songs she put out first, and then people were tricked into buying an album with sub-par material. I would suggest that if you are planning on buying this album, stop and take a minute to go to mtv.com and listen to it on the leak, it should be there for a few more days."
5,The world NEEDS J.Lo!,"""Rebirth"" continues to sell like hotcakes, proving that this record far from flopped. ""Hold You Down"" and ""Get Right"" are essential classics that will be rememberd years from now. Also there's also one other track produced by Timbaland, who's worked with genius Justin Timberlake! J.Lo is taking the world by storm. Don't be the last to know, just get this disc!"
1,Nothing caught me,"I was not impressed by ""Get Right"" and hoped for better, considering the album is called Rebirth. I really tried to listen and get something from this album but I didn't. Nothing caught me after a fourth listend and I sold it. Where are those good tunes like 'Waiting for Tonight"" and ""Ain't It Funny"" on this album. Everything is slow and boring!!! I did like ""Can't Believe this is Me"" but not enough to keep this album in my collection. Hopefully some good remixes and videos will bring a rebirth to these dull songs."
1,Lopez Fan very DISAPPOINTED!!!,REBIRTH is by far one of the worst CD's I have heard. Jennifer's lack of talent when it comes to music is evident. She should really think about sticking to her clothing line!!!
5,A stunning masterpiece of epic proportions,"You're not gonna get any better in 2005 than J.Lo's amazing ""Rebirth."" That song ""Get Right"" is one of the most popular songs off iTunes, and it's easy to see why: it ROCKS! There is no female singer better than J.Lo, expect for Janet Jackson, Madonna, Kylie, and Britney. Buy this amazing CD and expect your life to be changed forever."
1,rebirth my a**!!!!,oh my god!!! this album is awful... more of the same thing... just get right and hold you down are good... whatever you wanna do it's the worst song of her life!!!
1,dont buy it,"I think she missed the whole concept of rebirth. At any rate the only good track is ""Get Right""...well its at least easier to listen to than the other ones. Her voice on this cd is worse than on her previous work. She should refocus her talents on other areas and not on music."
1,she should be called N. Ta-- No Talent,"She has a TERRIBLE VOICE..which everyone knows from her horrib Grammy performance with ""husband"" Marc Anthony. This CD is boring and noise pollution.Boo to you J.Lo"
2,Not what it says on the label,As the authors admit..not original research..merely a synthesis. However too academically driven....footnotes etc which because it was collating others..was extensive. Finally I was /am more interested in the Moroccan Berbers whereas this book is more Algerian/ Tunisian. QED not very satisfactoryDr Victor Faux
5,One of my favorite books from childhood,Full of good clean fun Halloween ideas for kids. When I was a kid I read this book and haunted my parents' house for Halloween many times. Kid and parent approved.
1,Britney may as well be a porn star,"I can't stand this white girl. She's a man-stealing, lying, drug-taking, chain smoking, diet pill-popping, lip synching, hypocritical, talentless, trailer-park-trash jezebel tramp! Oooh, I do NOT like this dumb skank."
1,what's going on??,how dare you people support this trash? this little talentless cardboard cutout wholly embodies a twisted and decadent and ever degrading american culture. a product of the inevitable wrought society of decline in art and taste and anything worthy that a popular culture forged in capitalism concedes. you should be ashamed of yourselves. i prescribe an immediate social and intellectual and musical cleansing of a mr. randy newman or a mr. tom waits. Paul simon and perhaps leonard cohen would suffice. and you're all grounded. best wishes.
5,Britney goes from strenght to strenght in carrer at the top,"Hit, after hit ,after hit, after hit. This album is one of the best hit's packages in pop music. Britney is #1!"
5,BEST GREATEST HITS CD EVER,its the best BEST songs....and the remix disk is awsome i LOVE it everyone should buy it. !!!!!!!
1,stop,for all the hits and more go to amazonuk. they have the greates hits cd with i love rock&roll plus more for less the price you will pay for this one. you will be alot more happy with this copy.
1,You're Joking!!,"Her last CD was heavy breathing and giggling, just enough to hold the still-with-pimples set. THIS is scraping the bottom of my shoe. Truly junk"
1,greatest hits already?????????,"what a lame attempt to steal little girl's $ just in time for Christmas. hasn't she only been around since, what, 1996??? and a ""greatest hits"" already?? plus, Britney Spears/Greatest Hits is an oxymoron!"
2,She looks like a plastic barbie doll wearing fur,"I don't believe that she's lasted this long with that nasly voice. Some of her songs are ear candy, but she cannot sing or write her own songs at all and she shows no emotions in the music. And she just had to ruin bobby brown's classic hit too. Bad britney, bad bad bad! Janet Jackson's Design of a Decade would be a better investment for your money's worth if you ask me"
5,GREAT SINGER!!!!! BEST OF THE BEST!!!!!,"Obviously that all these swines who talk all these dirty things about britney really have no idea about what talent is. Britney got a special talent which all you, wholly sheep, would never ever achieve! You just envy her so much that talking all this nonsense about her makes you feel better. In fact, you are nothing and Britney is great. All those morons, like one who wrote this word in previuos review, are simply hampers with damaged brain. Britney is great!"
1,"worthless,pointless toxic crap",This collection of lousy songs should be called as worst songs instead.if this is good then I shudder to think how her bad songs would sound.not one song in this compilation is good.DONT EVER EVER BUY THIS TRASH.Get a great compilation from a band that write and sing their own songs like We sold our souls for rock'n'roll from Black Sabbath instead.ZERO STARS.
2,Britney's excusse to make a dollar.,"First of all I do love all the songs on the album, but most of them I already own on her normal cd's that came out not to long ago. In my opinion it is way to early in her career to have a ""greatest hits album"". Yes, I know shes been around for a few years...longer than most people expected, but she only has four albums, two of which weren't very good...Britney is a classic case of star that doesn't care what they do to their career so she has to get a greatest hits album out now before things goo to bad and everyone forgets about the mommy to be that had a select few years in the spotlight. I wouldn't recommend this album, everyone that is a britney spears fan already owns most of these song, but like two..its just like handing the already rich girl more of your hard earned money for no reason."
1,this cd sucks,"ur music sounds like a dyin goat. britney is all plastic, people don't buy this cd. it' sjust the worst cd of all time, it's like listenin to a plastic barbie doll. my personal ratin : - 2 / 10well enjoy!"
2,"In Russian: ""Ne Ochen Horosha!""","I must say that I can't suggest this software if you are looking to supplement a regular Russian language course. I bought Learn Russian Now! thinking that its record/playback features would help me with my accent, and that the dictionary would help me translate readings for class. Unfortunately, it didn't have a dictionary that looked up Russian to English efficiently, so it was impossible to pick a word from a homework assignment and find its meaning/pronunciation--you can only look up/hear words in the programs dialogs. Also, the playback feature would say my accent was perfect at times that my (human) tutor would cringe. If you don't have access to a real life person, this may be the next best thing to teach you Russian. However, if you are trying to find something to help you out with a class, a regular old dictionary might be a better investment."
3,size,"The spoons are of good quality, they were delivered as promised but they are rather small which I wasn't expecting. A better description is in order."
3,Spoons are a bit thin.,These are not as substantial as I would like. Otherwise ok. delivery was quick. I Just wish the spoons were a bit thicker.
5,Don't forget the design,What's so striking about this book is its wonderful graphic design. Every gadget is layed out with its own full page graphic design treatment. I'm normally pretty tired of this whole 80's retro thing.... but this is the best of the best of it.
5,Absolutely superb.,"Absolutely superb. Honest,straightforward and extremely inspiring. If you are fed up with the state of the American politics, this is the book that tells ALL that you've been feeling inside for quite a time and wanted someone to tell out loud. If you are unhappy with where both, republicans and democrats are taking this country, this book is for you. Because it fills the gap in between where rest of us stand. It talks about what non-voting majority feels and craves. No Jesse - YOU DO NOT STAND ALONE!!! Thank you for writing this book."
1,Unhappy Custemer,I Made Sure It Was Vol 1-4 Friends. I Wanted Vol 1-3. No Interest In Vol 4 Which Was One I Got. On Website Alot Of People Selling Were Just Selling Vol 4 Only That's Why I Chose This Company. If I Knew I Was Only Getting Vol 4 I Would Have Bought DVD Version For 81 Cents More From Different Company On Amazon.
1,Waste of time and money,"My daughter had to use this as a textbook for a college course. It was SO BAD it is almost unimaginable. In various sections it was: dense, unintelligible, stupid, absurd and... I'm running out of adjectives.It was, all in all, a perfect example of most of what is wrong with TEXTBOOKS, as compared to good teaching and/or original sources (although much of it WAS excerpts).It is truly sad that, apparently, college age students have so little understanding of what friendship, ethics and basic values of decent behavior and how to speak/communicate with other people are and/or should be, that they would need a book with the pretensious title Ethical Issues in Interpersonal Communication: Friends, Intimates, Sexuality, Marriage & Family (The Harcourt Communication Ethics Series, 2) and a class which could use such a text; even if the book were good... which it is NOT...Yech."
1,did they read the book??,"while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!!!"
1,Stephen King has Writer's Block,If you find lava lamps objects of terror then this might work as a horror flick. A green glow from the forest and in the eyes of the actors who really needed work was the major special effect. Personally I've been more terrified watching the Home Shopping Network. This will be definitely a Christmas present from me to a some luck individual to get it out of my video collection. This is supposed to be a Steve King story but Don King or Larry King could have written a more entertaining story.
2,Did you read the book?,Not really worth watching if you read the book. Do yourself a favor and read the book.
1,"Idiotic, pointless and, most of all, rubbish","Stephen King adaptations rarely get the treatment they deserve, and therefore (usually) come out looking average and lacksture. So what happens when you go through this process with a King book that was rubbish in the first place?Absolute crap is the answer, of course. This dire mini-series is 2 and a half hours of sleep-inducing soap opera, twenty or so minutes of midly entertaining ending, and almost 3 hours of pointless viewing in all. King was asking for it though; the actors (including Jimmy Smits, tragically miscast as Gard) have to wrestle with the terrible script and plot, and the special effects are suitably 1930's thanks to the small budget and the ridiculous stuff they had to re-create from the book. I was dissapointed that the evil flying drinks dispenser hadn't made it through to this crap interpretation.Just don't watch this. It's for your own good."
5,MAKAVELI LUV YOU DAWG !,"ALL OF MAKAVELI CDS ARE CLASSICS GET THEM ALL.HE IS THE GREATEST LIVIN RAP ATRISTS EVER TO HIT THE GAME.HE WOULD OF BEATEN B.I.G IN A FREESTYLE MATCH I KNOW THAT FOR SURE ,BUT B.I.G AIN'T WITH US NO MORE. BUY THIS CD NOW."

1,An unbelievable waste of time,"I read quite a bit. I usually have 2 or 3 books going at one time. This was the most boring, uninteresting book I can ever remember reading. The characters are one dimensional, the storyline is ridiculous. There is nothing remotely romantic or mysterious about any of it. I hate to even donate it to Good Will for fear of spoiling someone else's reading pleasure."
5,Her best yet!,"I've been reading Carla's books for a few years now and I can easily say she gets better and better. This book was one that kept me reading well past one am. If she continues at this pace, Ms. Neggers will soon be the number one romance writer in the country. This is definitely one to check out!"
3,My grandchildren do not appreciate this gift.,I didn't realize the font would be so small and there would be so few photos. My grandchildren are too young for this book. I took it away from them and will re introduce in a few years. They are 4 and 6. I do read the stories to them when they spend the night.
3,"A veces autopista, a veces callejon sin salida.","Compré este libro esperando que me sirviera de introducción al trabajo de Julio Cortazar. Logró su cometido estupendamente, aunque el trabajo en si llega a los extremos. Desde cuentos absolutamente brillantes como La Casa Tomada, y Cuentos de Cronopios y Famas, hasta historias aburridisimas, que no llegan a ninguna parte. Una lectura muchas veces espectacular, otras monotona y dificil. Cortazar no ha ganado un nuevo fanático conmigo, pero eso no es motivo para parar a nadie a leerlo. Aquellos que lo disfrutan, lo disfrutarán."
1,Still don't have a DVD that works,"The first DVD froze up after 30 seconds and was scratched badly ( was described as very good ) I contacted them promptly and they said they would send another copy.......Still have not seen it, it's been approx 2 weeks, so total of a month. Will not use them again. Scott M"
1,This was the worst movie I have ever seen,"I'd rather gnaw off my left leg than have to see this movie once again. I love suspense movies and rented this with high hopes, but I was sorely disappointed. Not only was it slow and unexciting, but it was long. Me and my roommate began watching this, and about an hour into the movie we were wishing it would finally just end. When the end came, it was unimpressive and didn't catch us since we had let our minds wander during this flop. There's many, many better movies out there."
3,Sounds like the rest..,"This is the classic metal-pop sound. The reason why the metal scene (or nu-metal?) is dying is because all the bands sound the same. They're all little spawns off each other. When i first heard bullet it reminded me of Lost Prophets gone angry. The cd is great, by all means. BUT, it is nothing too original. The guitars have a little more talent than the average trend bands, but like another reviewer said..its very predictable. Good album, worth buying..but it will sit on your shelf after a few weeks..."
5,Sweet and Passionate,"The Tchaicowsky CD with his piano concerto number one opus 23 and Romeo and Juliet and Nutcracker is a selection of some of the most beautiful, sweet and passionate music he has written. The concerto was written for piano and who better to play the piece on piano for this CD but Van Cliburn. Van Cliburn plays it superbly and the music comes alive with his rendition. The piano concerto is familiar music to many people who may not know the name of it. That is also true of Romeo and Juliet and Nutcracker. The beauty and quality and familiarity make this an excellent CD for purchase for gifts or for your own enjoyment."
5,"Timeless, practical advice, immediately implementable","In this short book are some of the most trenchant, clearly-written statements on how to be an effective executive ever written. It contains some philosophical statements, more real-world examples, and most importantly, it details actions the executive can take to become immediately effective. I wish I had read this 20 years ago!Other books like Good To Great and Built To Last are excellent, too, but are more strategic. This is the tactical book, beautifully and concisely written. If you want to be effective, buy this book now. It is brilliant."
3,"Advice is sensible but the examples are ""out of touch""",No doubt that Drucker is a master when it comes to what makes executives effective. But his advice is a lot about common sense and his examples of effective leadership often date back to the mid-50's and earlier. I enjoyed reading the book but finished it being neither motivated nor changed.
2,"Not as advertised, not the best","As you have no doubt already read, this is *not* the premiere movie from 1993 but rather the 1998 TNT version. That irked me, and I hope that the distributors of this movie and amazon.com correct this mistake.This DVD literally contains an ad for Season 1 on DVD and the TNT version of ""The Gathering"". Nothing else. There's not even a menu on this DVD. This is as bare-bones as it gets, but then again, you are paying a few bucks for it so you get what you pay for.The only reason this merits two stars is literally the content. This is a editing of the movie that started it all for Babylon 5, laying the groundwork for a five year storyline. While it can seem a bit drab and drawn out, if you watch the show you will return to this movie and see things you never saw before.My recommendation is to getBabylon 5 - The Movie Collectioninstead. You will get a much better experience with the same movie as part of that set."
2,I watched this after B5 was long over,"I am truly amazed that this show ever made it to 5 years based off of the pilot. Some of the parts of the movie were a bit campy, but you do have to consider that the technology available to do special effects were limited. The content was ok, but... I'm glad B5 wasn't judged solely on the Pilot..."
1,THE BEATS ARE TIGHT,"INSTRUMENTAL VERSION WOULD GET 5 STARSINCLUDE 50'S LYRICS AND YOU GET GARBAGE!!!!NO TALENT WHATSOEVER, JUST GREAT BEATS"
3,Decent,The only good thing about this cd is its beats. 50 cent raps about the same thing on every single song with a few exceptions(12 quetions) thats the few exeptions. I recomend having a friend burn you a copy or borrow it and burn it yourself.
3,Not one clever lyric,"I'm not at all surprised that this album has been such a huge hit - the beats and songs are way above average and, most rare for a rap album, it's solid all the way through. However, 50 is a garbage lyricist. His stuff rhymes, and his lines about street violence and wealth are notable for their veracity, but that's really about it. There are no quotable bursts of wordplay on the entire CD. 50 should take some of his millions and slide some Llyod Banks's way in exchange for his rhyme book."
5,50 Cent ~Underground Legend...Heard Worldwide,"For Years undrground fans have known 50 Cent as one of the best to flow, but now with his release of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"", Everyone across the world will feel the power of his words. Almost every track, including all of the bonus tracks, have very nice beats and he delivers lyrics that leave a big impression. Some may say that ""In Da Club"" and ""Wanksta"" are too commercial but i beg to differ, b/c 50 Cent is as real as any rapper gets. When he talks about guns, no lie there, he's been shot 9 times. This cd is most definitely worth your money, so GO GET IT!"
1,why does every1 like 50 Cent?I dont get it..,"I never actually bought this cd but i dont need to. Why don't i need to, because 50 cent sucks. He can't rap,all he does is mumble,and the only reason people like him is because he was produced by eminem. Most people who listen to 50 are pre-pubescent girls that the like the songs because of the beats.Why dont people listen to good rappers like King Gordy and Esham. So in conclusion 50 cent sucks."
2,The next shmo who flows?,"Imagine all the sweet beats on this album blanketed by Eminem's rapping and lyrics. That would've been something amazing. Too bad we're stuck with 50's droll voice and moronic rhymes. It's tragic.I think 50 should thank his lucky stars. All 2 of them. Yep, I'm talkin' about Em and Dre."
1,Guess what 50 cents sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Two words:No TalentAny idiot could make a crappy rap song!And this shows it!
1,Gangsta rap ? 50 ? Are you joking ?,"I used to have respect for 50 when he was underground but now ? I can't stand him, at all. Ight, 50 plays pop rap not gangsta rap and you wnat to kno what gangsta rap was ? Nwa, the chronic (Dre & Snoop), Ice cube,easy z, 2pac,bonethugs & harmony now that was the old dayz and gangsta rap no longer exists. As for 50 cent's ""get rich or die tryin"" it is not gangstrap nor its gangsta at all because most nuggaz into 50 are either white or trl fans so therefore? Its wack. The whole album is wack and 50's lirycal skills are gone like the wind yo. All i gotta say is that 50 need to stop tryna act like dat wack azz nugga pac and just be himself. It hurts for me to say this since i was the biggest fan of 50's underground stuff but fifty and ja rule are alike. Don't support gay unit or 50! GAYY UNITTTTT!!!"
1,He aint worth 50 cents,"50 Cent, P. Diddy, Nelly, Vanila Ice, Ja Rule, Lil' Bow Wow, G Unit, Murpfy Lee, Chingy, St. Lunaticks- reason why today rap is crap. GRODT is the worst album in 2003( and that says alot). I felt so dum while I wus lisening this crap, that I avantly destroi it. "" In the hood they say 50 you are hot, I want them to like my like they love Pac"". NEVER YOU ************, you will never had respect that Pac had! Beacose you aint no rapper, you are only a fool that thinks is cool to get shot 9 times! I hope you and Ja Rule will shot each other."
2,Kingpin of 86',"The album didn't live up towards the hype. It is nowhere near Nas's Illmatic or Biggie's Ready To Die. This album was well produced but 50 didn't have the lyrical flow and his MCin' is really awful. U can bearly understand what the f@ck he is tryin' to say. If this album is just for parties and clubs, then 50 has suceeded, but if he is trying to get the spot of being one of the greatest MC's of all time, then he has FAILED! I can't believe people are comparing him to 2Pac or B.I.G. He is nowhere near their league when it comes to dope lyrics and awesome lyrical flow. For a guy who has been shot and stabbed hasn't really been talking about his life experience in his album. He just talks about his money, cars and jewelery. I was really disapointed with this album, because I know 50 Cent can do better, he just needs to apply himself. There were a few tracks that I did enjoy listening to, which were:Patiently Waiting and Many Men (Wish Death)!"
2,Gangsta,"Not good. If your the kind who likes every other word to be expressed with vulgarity, then this is the album for you. There is really no talent and musically not fulfilling, I ended up giving the cd away because I was so unimpressed, something I never do. The G-Unit cd is better."
1,whts up with this...................?,ok lets start first of all i used to love 50 cent but after awhile when he and ja rule didn't like eachother i started thinkin um.........no ja rule is awesome and if anybody has a problem w/him you talk to him and not put it out for the world to know ya know wht i mean.anyways another thing tht wasn't kool was at this award show 50 cent was a nominee for an award and he didn't win so the artist tht won went up on stage to get their award but 50 cent thought tht he truly deserved the award so he goes up on stage to get the reward tht he didn't even win!!he has way to big of an ego ok so tht is wht did it for me so i get his cd ya know just to see wht it sounds like and i play it and i am like wht is this? this is crap why would you wanna listen to this it is horrible so now and until there is no tomorrow i will never like 50 cent again his songs SUCK!!
1,stanks,This is crappy music and only gangstas like austin derris like this kill kill crap. He is a bum.
2,OVERRATED,"This is a truely bad rap CD from one of the most overrated artists of all time. It has great production, but 50 Cent is a flat-out horrible lyricist. This guy is NOT the next Tupac, although he may be the next Ja Rule or DMX.Someone said that if you like The Roots, you probably won't like this CD, and I have to agree. If you like Eminem's new stuff (not his old, Slim Shady stuff. They are completely different, as Slim Shady was FAR superior to the current, no punchline dropping, Em), or DMX or 50's underground tracks, you will probably like this CD. If you like lyrical content in your rap, you will not.It's a shame this guy was signed over Royce Da 5'9."
1,a mental handicapped man can rap better,"Alright Ill admit 50 cent can rap; But he's with Eminem! If 50 choose to go a different route then sign with a white boy who is more stale then a box of crackers open for a week. This guy couldnt get a contract or was it about the money? Em cant think of anything so he acts all cool and gobbles up all this bad ass talent, tames them, then the public eats them up and Em makes money off black men. When will someone actully realize what im saying?"
1,Commercial junk,"50 Cent is everything hip pop is rite now. Some fool thinkin hes gangster and releasing a terrible rap album, Its rappers like these that make people think that rap is all bout being a ghetto pimp and havin lots of cash. 50 cent has boring rhymes and cant flow for his life. If u want a club album here it is but for gods sake if u love hip hop like i do dont buy this junk."
4,Gettin shot pays off,"ok this cd is good, but u gotta kill that radio that u have. they only play 21 questions and in da club and the edits make them sound really stupid. if u can buy the un-edited, edited music doesn't sound good and you don't know the words. 50 is ok but he mumbles 2 much and is hard 2 understand at times. y he diss' on other rappers isn't cool, if u need 2 diss on some1 just 2 make music u shouldn't even b in the biz, he's orginal but he'll go pop just like the rest of them over time."
1,Fugaaaazi ass rappers.,"This is garbage. I wish he would of died trying because that story would make him more ""legendary"" than his feeble attempts at boasting himself. ""Ooooohhh you got shot"" Big deal. Any dumbass can get shot. Don't make you special. As a matter of fact it is depressing when people compare him to the likes of the revolutionary 2pac. No where near the power of 2Pac. This isn't true hip hop in the sense that it is all about ""the club"" and constantly gett'n crunk with dumb ho's. That ain't real life. That isn't the struggle of making it. That is already made pure and simple. This album and the G-Unit album ""Beg for Mercy"" (Trust me Banks, 50 and that cash-money floozie, I am begging for mercy because it is hard to turn on the T.V and not hear your crap brand of Hip Pop) are just club songs. That's it. No truth, no skill and tinkerbell-ass beats. Enjoy it and consume it America. You love this crap."
3,Get Rich Or Go On TRL and Keep Tryin',"I picked up this album when it first came out and thought it was okay, a little overrated, but I like it. I have to say that his underground and freestyle stuff is much better. Most of the songs on this album sound like they were made for the radio, and probably are. I'm interested in seeing in what direction he goes on his next album, back to the raw underground stuff, or back to TRL to promote more singles."
4,Worth the money...,This album is worth the money the lyrics are good people are hatin on him for a reason. If it wasn't for nas then 50 would be on top of the rap game. I recomend this album if your lookin to get pumped up for a fight because all your really going to get is lessons on how to push someone's wig back.
1,This is Poor lyrical skills at it's best,What's the dealabout this over hyped artist?the guy claims to be a rapper don't make me laughhe has the lyrical skills and vocab range of a 11 year oldalot of unsigned talent on the streets especially in the uk who could make 50 cent look whackthe tracks are commerical they [...] they are overplayed and he's lyrics are weakpeople are comparing this chump to tupac? haha
1,Terrible,There is no other way to describe my feeling that 50 and his incorherent babble sell millions of albums while acts like Tribe Called Quest could never break big.....
2,Hot but Not,"I gotta admit I like 50's flow and I think a bunch of the tracks are real catchy and hot. The problem is, there is very little substance to 50's flow, and his songs get close to sounding the same on this album. It makes me wonder how he'll be able to put out another good album. I see 50 as a decent rapper with a catchy flow, but idnot see him droppin anotbher album regarded so highly or being remembered with the great MC's of today, because the fact is as a lyricist he is ok, and there are 100 MC's out there today who could rip him on wax or off the dome. I like 50 though, he's somewhat refreshing to hear, and I wish him luck in droppin another hot album."
5,Amazing Tracks,Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of the best albums out there50 Cent has really good songs wit sick beats
3,nothing special,"I dont know what all the hype was about...in da club was catchy, but i see no special lyrical quality in any of these songs, he doesnt say anything i havent heard before. he doesnt hit you like Em (who is vastly superior to everyone in the industry). This is a good album, but nothing we'll be talking about (or listening to) in 6 months. the hype was just that, and i am unimpressed and im glad i heard it before i bought it."
5,must get,"50 cent aka 50 aka ferrari aka f-50...supplies us with new tracks and new beats which are contagious, once you start listening you wont be able to stop, you must get this cd and start bumping it asap"
2,quite mediocre,"Before the review is written here is my official discliamer: I like rap, I like other music too. I will not just boo hoo and album because it is mainstream or because affiliations with cretain artists.This album however is rather medicore, it shows no sign of lyrical talent and Dre's 'dope' producing is being wasted. I think the song that I am referring to is PIMP, well anyway this song was some of the weakest rhyming that I have ever heard. The rhyme sceme is simpler than 80s Eric B and Rakim. He rhymes to the E for like a whole stanza. Anyway even if the lyrics are weak and unitelligent, they are often catchy adn even as I am mocking in da club I am still singing along and waving my hand around. My singing along is however impaired by the unitelligeble lyrics. i cannot understand half of the words on this album. Overall this album is somewhat catchy, yet overall very weak."
1,"Horrible, Not Hip Hop, Trash, Played Out","This pop album not lyrical skills whatsoever, just the fact that he's under EMINEM makes him ""good"". This is ideal for High Skool kids who think this is real hip hop. Worse album, ever"
1,He died trying......,"first I'd like to start of saying that I would have given this NO stars if possible50 cents sucks.....which doent suprise me.....hip hop sucks....riddle me this....why is is so popular? Who knows! its nothing but a bunch of gangter (by the way you guys need to learn to spell...) wannabees who think talking over a looped synthasized beat is music.....HERES NEWS FOR YOU! ITS NOT! GO LISTEN TO SOME REAL MUSIC! Led Zeppelin, Metallica, as a matter of fact anything but this would be just great!50 cent SUCKSJay-z SUCKSG-unit SUCKSRAP MUSIC SUCKS! GET A CLUE!I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR 50 HIMSELF!1. get a real name2.Go to school and learn how to spell gangster3.listen to some decent music4.get braces....5.get A FREAKIN' LIFE!"
2,Bangin Beats but no rap skill,"Ok ill admit before half the world started listenin to 50 I was listenin to his old cd's like ""Guess Whose Back"" and ""Power Of The Dollar"" which were cool he was tryin to rap and he was decent then in 8-Mile when he spits in the song ""Places To Go"" I thought he was gettin better so I rushed to go comp. this album and once I really listened to it like I did my first 2Pac album I said: ""this man is a sell out"" he clearly did not have the drive to produce music and doesnt understand what REAL rap is about. This CD is made for 14 year old teenage girls and 50 cant rap. at least not anymore as for G-unit Lloyd banks can rhyme some ok metaphors but its the same old tiring bull ish. My point is this is just another Puff Daddy resembling poppy beat only album so dont go buy it if you listen to real rap like: 2pac, Biggie,Kool G Rap, Canibus, DMX, Jedi Mind Tricks, De La Soul, Pharoah Monch and so on.Hope I saved you some cash."
1,A rapper's image....but not talent,"2 call 50 cents overhyped would be an understatement. He reminds me of that guy everyone had in their highschool studyhall who could rap. There are thoudands on his caliber. Lil Flip, Fabulous, and others. The sad thing is, 50 blew up 2 be one of the top rappers. RAPPING IS NOT ABOUT IMAGE. Its not about being shot, it's about rhyming about a particular topic and making sense, or {for the truely gifted ones} telling a story of sorts. 50 can't do either. He can act and look tough. Great for magazines, bad for radio."
3,"You can hate him, you can love him, either way, he's NGA","Not Going Anywhere.I was a die-hard 50 Cent fan wayyy before this guy even scratched the surface of the hip-hop music industry, and I have to say, this album wasn't as great as I expected. Don't get me wrong, a gem here and there can be found on Get Rich Or Die Tryin', but this isn't classic by any means.The way I see it, half the album is hot, half filler material, but even on the filler material, 50 presents one of the hottest flows this industry has experienced in years it seems. That's what makes this guy so special when he's on the mic. Sure this guy isn't a Canibus, or Chino XL, but who in today's game has a higher level of mic presence?All in all, 50 Cent could have pushed out a better album, and I doubt his next album will be any better, but this album is worth the money you pay for it."
1,"Good god, would you look at him!",Wow! Doesn't he look hard on that front cover! I'm quivering in my boots!... yeah so here's some reasons why 50 Cent and rap music is crap:They don't write their own lyrics and if they do they fail.They have rubbish easy beats in the background to add 'effect'.They usually get loads of people featuring on songs so they don't have to show off their wonderful talent.They don't play any instruments whatsoever.If you disagree with those points then you obviously don't know what music you're listening to.50 Cent and his 'hommies' are just posers who have no talent at all. But..... if you're interested in listening to talented heavy metal then try out Opeth or Metallica. Rap sucks.
1,Average at best is played to much,i know 50 has lil bit of skills but he would be nothin with out dre and the only reason he sells records or as much is because he is with a white b*oy eminem this cd is so played out i hate aftermath and 50 is so uncreative just the same old same old im gangsta i blow you away if you talk bad or would you love me if i was down and out i mean 50 u make the same records as ja rule if not more u actor6.5 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of 10 beatsFavorite Track:What Up Gangsta
3,His Last Album Was Better,This album is worth buying no lie its tight. But I still think (guess whos back) was better but hey everyone gots different opinions.
4,a solid album,"This album isn't as bad as some people say, but if you like rap, you might like this album, his lyrics need some work, his first single ""In da club"" which is catchy with a tight beat done by DRE. his second single ""21 questions"" which is an excellent song with a tight beat also, but it have been played on the radio too much, but there are some pointless songs, and they seem like they were written in a matter of 10 min, like "" like my style"" and "" poor lil rich"", other than that, this album is worth the price of admission"
3,50 cents not that bad,"i am kind of a 50 cent fan, and althogh,granted hes not the best rapper in the world, hes not that bad, certainly not as bad as you all say he is, he has some great beats on this album and the lyrics aren't diobolical. i think you should give him a break, and if he is as bad as you say, he wouldn't have made it big. i do not, however believe he is worth the amount of money he gets paid, and he sure as h*ll is no tupac,biggie or nas"
2,Loose Change,"Wanksta was a good song. In Da Club was ok. The rest of the album is just BAD. Don't take me the wrong way by the title to this(ie. Loose Change), I hate Ja Rule's rap too, but Get Rich Or Die Tryin isn't worth the money. Most of the beats are really good - wether it was Eminem or Dre or whoever else that produced it, I'd buy this CD if it had the Instrumentals.But the truth is, Fitty definately does NOT deserve the hype he's getting. Obie Trice is so much better than him, and D12 totally outdoes Fitty's gUnit. Though I found his tracks Back Down and Order of Protection kinda funny and how they made fun of Ja, but the CD isnt worth the money."
5,wow,This is one of the best cds i have heard in my life. this is one of the few cds i can put in and press play and let it play without skiping tracks. if i could i would give it 20 stars
2,50 cent is the premier rapper of our time,"this album was good, containing several good songs, this cd is still in my player, i recommend it"
5,OH My God!,This album was bananas it was crazy one of the best albums i could say eva but not there yet but ya 50 did his thing
5,Quality Debut!,"50 delivers on his released album. Yes he talks about being shot, yes he talks about money and yes he talks about women. But don't let that take away from the fact that the beats are hot and his lyrical content is better than expected. I ain't riding him (check out my review for The Massacre) but this album is class. Virtually every song is good with the standouts being the more gangsta tracks such as Heat and Many Men. Think what you will but this is an album worth buying and will forever be a classic.Top 5:HeatMany MenU Not Like MePatiently WaitingDon't Push Me"
1,Overhype come get some,"Wanna talk about the overhyped artists? Justin Timberlake, Usher and 50 Cent.You wnna know why he is named 50 cent? Cuz thats all he is worth.This man has no talent. No rap artists have talent. Oh they can talk fast with a beat. Big deal. Thats not music. You wanna talk about music? How about the real artists who make true music who use their voices to convey important messages, not messages about raping and murdering enemies. Real music is Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Vanessa Williams."
3,good debut (3.5),"Ok, this album is a little overrated but it's a good debut but really so, the album has some catchy beats that grab you into the songs, but ""get rich or die trying"" is not all filled with radio friendly tunes for the ladies, matter of fact, there are some hard-core tunes like ""many man"" and ""dont push me"", On the negative side 50 cent's lyrics need work and his voice can be annoying, sometimes I have trouble trying to understand the words coming out of his mouth, lyrically 50 cent is nothing, but lyrics are not everything in a song.Production: beats 9/10.....lyrics 3/10Favorite tracks: what up gangsta, many man."
1,Why not to buy this album,I was quite excited when i bought the album due to my loving the song wagnsta. After hearing the other songs on the cd i went and sold it...It was that bad. His cd was a one hit wonder. Even his new song in da club [was bad]. So i say if you are going to buy this album because you like 50's two songs and think that there will be others just as good you are wrong . Dont waste your money.
1,NOTE TO PUBLIC: My Rating Is MINUS (-) 1 star,It ought to be WORTH 50 cents. This guy sucks AND blows...
1,READ THIS IT WILL HLP UR DECISION ALOT!!!!!!!,"Ja Rule if ur reading this don't u dare back down50 cent u need help first of all wat the heck is with ur lyrics i mean c'monTHE ONLY REASON HE IS EVEN GETTING LOOKED AT IS BECAuSE HE GOT SIGNED FROME EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!50 u tried to get in the rap game but u won't stay famous long with lyrics like""U A POPTART SWEETHART""WAT IS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!also evidently u watch sesame street if u no who the cookie monster sounds like and who is like.hey 50 let me give u a hint about sumthingTHE RULE WONT DIEstop mumbling tell rule ur srry n rap about sumthing else, n earn urself in to the rap game like ja didDon't pick up this crap pick up any of Rule's cds i like blood in my eyeGet his 1st album or blood in my eye if u weant harcoreGet his others if u want a mixture i would say Rule 3:36 is a good mixtureJa RUle keep doing wat u do"
2,HALF DOLLAR,"WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT!!! I DON'T GET IT!!! NO LYRICAL SKILSS WHAT SO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NONE!!!! But hey, I like ""IN DA CLUB"" and ""21 QUESTIONS"". No Eminem..There would be no Fifty. THANK GOD FOR DR. DRE AND GENEROUS RECORD DEALS. BUT FIFTY WITH EMINEM IS LIKE HAVING EYORE FROM WINNIE THE POOH AGAINST BUGS BUNNY. But I got respect for him, he can take a bullet."
3,50 Cent gettin rich,"This album was probably the most hyped album that I can remember being around for. Others like Pac's ""all eyez on me"" and big's ""life after death"" were perhaps more hyped, but i was too young to remember. I went on out and bought this album the first day it came out, and although it is a good album overall, i was somewhat dissapointed. The album does start off with a band as the first 2 tracks are some of my favorites, but as the LP moves on, so does my skip button. I am not knocking 50's skills or anything, but given all they hype, i expected more, thats why i give it 3 stars.But 50 has potential to be as big as tupac and biggie, just not with this album, no matter how many radio hits he has or copies of ""get rich..."" he sells"
3,SO SO,"50 Cent has talent, but this album showed no display. Sha Money's beats were not doing it, Eminem's beat didnt shine. The lyrics were not exactly gangsta or floss. I expect a 2Pac hit em up style or California love party till the morning style. But only a couple of songs assembled that, In da Club, Back Down, Blood Hound. Some of the other songs are plain garbage and you cannot sit through it. Delivery was okay, gets a B- but the lyrics about getting shot 9 times and how bad Ja Rule is is pretty old. PIMP is very commercial. If I Can't was a listenable son but 21 questions is trying to show his mellow side, and he wasn't very good at it. ""I love u like a fat kid loves cake."" good metaphor there. Hes a rookie and he has alott of protential under Eminem and Dr. Dre, hes crew display little talent, but as long as he shines, he will be okay."
2,2 stars for music...5 for his body,"I really am not a fan of the rap music. I mean, here is somebody that has been shot at 9 times (supposedly), has openly copped to dealing drugs and being involved in gang violence. But he is making millions of dollars, while people like me who are honest and hardworking are scrapping to get by. So, since I really hate rap music (2 stars for the music...) I will review the brotha's chest. OMG...he is built like a brick ....house!!! He is hot!!!"
3,Not What I Expected,"50 Cent has some good songs on this cd, but it lacked the hip-hop of what I thought it would have. The songs are more of an R&B beat. Not something like DMX. If you are into the more mellow sound of rap, this is a great cd to listen to."
1,50 cent?,50 cent is not a rapper. this album is not music. I enjoy good rap. this is trash.. i've known who 50 cent was since the early 90s all the way through to when he was on the mixtape circuit with g-unit...and he progressivly got worse and worse. thats about all i have to say..go buy common - like water for chocolate.50 cent hahaha.
1,Wonderful!,"This man is the best male vocalist since Frank Sinatra! He sings beautiful songs such as the soaring and optimistic ""In Da Club"" which promotes sex and not making love which is the kind of messages our young people need to hear! And who couldn't love the gorgeous ballad ""21 Questions???"" Just listen to Cent's precise vibratto and the leghatto flow. Then of course we have PIMP and other terrific pop ditties. I just love positive and optimistic music that preaches the thug life in such wonderful terms to the world's young people so they can get shot up too. :)"
2,"50 Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'""","The songs on this album are good to listen to.... the first few times. After listening to 50 Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" repeatedly on both the CD and the radio, I realized how monotonous all the songs sound, and how similar they are to each other. While listening to the CD, I felt as if I was just listening to one track over and over."
4,"please, actually listen to the album","i get tired of hearing people say they dont like artists anymore, as soon as the artist gets popular. the way i rate an album is the playback value. this one is very high, i can listen to ""what up gangsta"" ""many men"" ""heat"" ""back down"" ""p.i.m.p"" ""wanksta"" over and over again, the rest of the album hits too. look owwt 4 Obie Trice in '03"
3,Check this out,"He's one of the better contemporary rappers. Unlike rich and bloaded P. Diddy and others, he lived the thug life. He's only singing about it now. Rap is not what is used to be, but this comes close."
2,Awful,"2 stars for 21 Questions, and it's just for it's production. The rest is MTV overpopulated garbage. Except for 21 Questions, I'd rather listen to a Britney Spears song 10 times then one song on this CD."
1,50 cent sucks,"50 cent has been shot 9 times. wow! who cares? his music sucks and it takes apsolutely no talent to rap.If you're reading this it's probably because your a pathetic little queer who has no taste in music what so ever and what's to buy a 50 cent cd.well take my advice and if you want to listen to good music, buy some cannibal corpse, slayer, meshuggah, of cradle of filth cds.50 cent sucks,his music sucks and all rap in general sucks."
5,Bump this junt manne!,"Even Dirty South folk sayin 50 u hot!!! For all the B-S I hear from these lollypop r & b rappers, 50 came with some real heat. This is what it sounds like when a rapper goes nationwide but still has a hard as hell sound to him. ""Back Down"" is a str8 roast on the queen of R & B, Ja Rule. ""In Da Club"" well we all heard that, judge it 4 yaself. It's bumpin 2 me. The hardest single on here is ""Many Men"" now that's REAL street muzik!! Other bumpin thangs on here are ""Blood Hound"", ""Poor Lil Rich"" , ""21 Questions"", and ""Dont Push Me"" Buy It, Burn It, just get this junt manne! S-M-G !!!"
1,Good title - book falls flat on its face.,"Title is good for the author. For the customer, you, not. Buyer beware."
4,Not the best...but pretty true to book,"The production value is not great. Sound and lighting leave a lot to be desired, especially when switching from indoor to outdoor scenes. Sometimes the lighting is so bad it's difficult to tell whats going on. But at around 3 hours long, it follows the pace of the book pretty well. All in all it's nice to have for someone who collects Jane Austin based movies."
2,Just not up to scratch...,"First of all let me say that I was really looking forward to seeing this version. I adore the 1995 one with Hinds and Root, think it's marvelous and was hoping for more of the same. In comparison this was like the high school (and not terribly talented one) freshman class play. Bryan Marshall was good as Wentworth, but Ann Firbank was inexcusably wooden as Anne. Not to mention her wig was horrendous. It made her so top heavy I kept expecting her to fall over! The set was stagey, but given the year of the production I more or less expected that. Just not up to scratch.They get two stars for having completed the production but not for much else."
2,"Not nearly as enjoyable as ""P2"" (Root/Hinds version)","It's still Jane Austen, so how bad could it be? It gets 2 stars automatically just because it is an adaptation of my favorite book written by my favorite author, but I firmly believe that going out of your way to cram as much of Jane Austen's words as possible into an adaptation does not necssarily make it a good adaptation. I didn't like the casting, I hated the costumes (especially Anne's green plaid dress!), the hair was laughable (dittos to the Caroline Bingley allusion!), and the acting was wooden. If I wanted the audiobook, I would have rented that instead of this. This reeks of the '70s; get the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds instead."
1,Save your money,"I am big fan of the BBC 10970's era Pride and Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility so I thought I would enjoy this as well.Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel.Sadly, between the 60 years old Anne who lacked that inner fire, the Little house on the prairie fabrics and the scary mismatched interiors I had difficulty watching this film.It didn't help that Capt Wentworth never bothered to steal a secret glance so we hoped maybe he still cared.There was no follow through, so the letter he writes at the end made no sense.See the Persuasion with Amanda Root.Don't bother with this one."
1,Appalling acting and hideous video quality,"I couldn't even sit past the second scene. The actors seemed as if they were reading their scripts without any direction or preparation; it was shot for TV in a way that simply doesn't hold up compared with modern productions, and the sets and costumes are unbearably '70s. I could do a better production myself just by getting my friends together for a casual reading and videotaping it, and so could you.I strongly recommened reading the book (which is fantastic), then watching the '90s movie, which though very understated and not as explanatory as it should be, is at least watchable."
1,? Yeah!,"This was awful. All I can say is if you are a Hilary Swank fan, rent it so you can quit walking past it with curiousity in the video store. Just get it out of the way and done with. Obviously it's only been released to make a few bucks out of Swanks's breakthrough in Boys Don't Cry. Her only good part in the movie is at the end. Chad Lowe is hideous in it, each part dragged on and on- my fast forward button served me well. Jeez, what a waste."
1,Bleeechhh!!!!,Possibly the worst movie ever made - dialogue was improved immensely by putting it on Fast Forward.
3,Not what I expected,"I didn't read the description close enough. I expected the ""classic"" metal lid and bigger pots and pans.This is a cute set for small portion cooking but not big enough for a family."
4,Great starter cookware set,"Ordered this to stock a new seasonal condo. Meets all the basic needs. It looks good and hopefully has ""Farberwares"" quality and longevity. For the price a good value."
5,Cost and Quality is Perfect,It cooks without burning. Great start up cookware set. The quality is very good for the price and it washes without leaving stains.
3,Classic Collection,doesn't keep shine when used... keeps even heat distribution though... i use cast iron skillets so buy different skillets because of the full aluminum framing... the other pots are full surgical 18/10 steel... great and long lasting... suggest this set for beginners to moderate chefs...
5,Absolute Fun,"My son loved this video when he was a toddler. I enjoyed watching it too. Enough to purchase it now, and my son is 14yrs old, so I can share it with friends that have little children.Pauly Shore is engaging and the kids show that standard children songs can be updated and 'hip'. It's ROCK and Read and that is what they do."
2,Where's the edited audio track?,"I love the show, but I was very disappointed when I found out there wasn't another audio track with bleeped bad language. Now I'm either going to have to only watch this by myself or return it. Poor move on MTV/Paramount's part. Even the Osbournes got an edited track and they're just as bad or worse! Surely it wouldn't have been THAT difficult to add an edited track. Had they done this, it easily would've gotten 5 stars from me. I personally don't mind bad language much, but some of the people I would have been watching this with DO mind. Very, very lame. And something that could have been so easily corrected!"
1,come on ???,"I am really not knocking the show .. but more questioning, Why would anyone feel the need to actually spend money on a show like this ? I mean come on .. just turn on MTV ??Once you have seen an episode .. and the celebrity is punked... why would you need to have it on DVD? Is there people that really want to watch the same GAG twice ?? that would be boring .. save your money and just watch the NEW shows on MTV !"
1,didn't work,I mistakenly purchased the wrong Epson ink cartridges but when I discovered the mistake it was past the return date for the product. The vendor refused to swap this product for the correct product.
4,"Like the series, 3rd disc won't play","I enjoy this series, however disc # 3 has something wrong with it and will not play. I gave this as a gift, and would like to know how to remedy this."
5,"""Keep Ya Head Up""","The deepest lyrics I have ever heard. This Cd represents and reflects on the struggle of the people. ""Keep Ya Head Up"" touched my thuggish heart,and made me realize what i ignored my whole life. 2pacs work will open your eyez to the reality of life...THUG LIFE...Papa'z Song, is the realist lyrics I've ever heard. Also apperances by Ice Cube show the excellence of tupac and Cube at the rap game..."
4,GOOD INTERESTING RAP MUSIC I CAN JAM OUT TO,WELL ALL I CAN SAY THAT THIS TAPE IS REALLY GOOD ESPEACIALLY THE SONG I GET AROUND. THIS MUSIC KEEPS YOU CALM AND LET'S YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AND LET'S YOU SEE THE REAL WORLD WE LIVE IN.
4,neat,"The earliest work from pac,the beats are good but the album could of been better.Not 2pac's best album , but definetly a classic with hits like keep ya head up,i get around.Its similar to 2pacalyspe but it aint better than me against the world or all eyez and 7dt.If you have'nt got me against the world or all eyez on me or 7 day theory then i suggest u get one of them to this."
4,"An Upgrade over 2pac's 1st, yet still political but much better. Strictly 4 my N","Strictly 4 my, is better than 2pacalypse now, still preachy/panther/political, but good songs/collabo with Big Syke in Papaz Song, which you can hear pac's anguish, and the social message about dead beat fathers. Ice Cube and Ice-T are on here as well. there are alot of good songs."
4,OK,its just some of the songs I cant get into it but still the songs that are hot are hot anyway I wouldnt recommend this for somebody that liked the real thugged out Pac maybe more for the political Pac but its a good CD
3,it's aight,"it aint my fav pac album but its cool. I like the cuts ""strictly 4 my niggaz"", ""representin93"", and ""i get around"". I give it 3 stars."
3,Am I high?,"Someone help me! I'm having a heart attack! Does the price for MILL VALLEY, with Rita Abrams class actually say $148.00, and if so can I ask the most rediculous question of my life---WHY?!"
5,The best!,This stroller is the best! I bought it to use with my grandchildren (9!) when they visit. Each of my daughters(4) wanted it when they saw it. Strongly built but lightwieght. Attractive and easy to use. Suitable for a younger child or an older one. This stroller has a good size storage area underneath as well as a sun shade. The only thing it lacks is a cup holder. You will not go wrong with the Graco IPO.
3,Simple is the best,"Great choice.Easy foldable.Does not take up much space.Cons:1) Wheels are not as strong as it should, so the front ones already needed some oil to make sure they worked fine.2) The upright position is not that upright.All in all, good choice."
4,Sturdy small stroller,I like that this stroller is very sturdy and it can hold heavy bags on its handles. I also like that it has a deep storage area and that the seat is adjustable. One thing I think could be improved is that there is no padding on the metal parts close to the baby/ toddlers face. I made some cushions for my son. He would cry every time his face would accident hit the exposed metal. Its a great stroller for the price.
4,Nice Strooler for Price,"This is a well made reclining stroller for the price. It moves pretty easily through stores and sidewalks. It has enough storage for a small diaper bag, a small purse or blanket. I love the fact that I can hang a larger diaper bag, purse or coat on the handles and it does not tip over like other strollers. I like the 5 point harness; however it could have been designed better for those parents who have wiggle worms! My child is 10 months and fits in this stroller nicely...it also works with my 2 year old niece. My only wish would have been that this stroller would have had a detachable cup holder/storage area by the handles. All in all this is a great stroller for the price."
5,Strudy and Compact,I had a Combi stroller that was hard to steer and started looking for a new compact stroller and the Graco Ipo is prefect! It folds up super small and has a handle for carrying. We loved it for the airport. It is also great that it is umbrella size and reclines. Even older kids get wore out! Also the basket holds lots of stuff. I did buy a seperate cup holder...it is a great stroller!
5,Love this stroller,This stroller was exactly what we were looking for when we went in vacation! Took it through the airport my daughter was able to sit comfortably sleep well and it traveled great!!
5,Thymes body wash,"When I'm tired of smelling like a rose, I switch to my favorite lavender body wash by Thymes. The only time I don't use it is when I am on assignment with the FBI or CIA and must maintain my confidential status. Then I must use the CIA -issued odorless cleaning products. When the great lavender smell is emanating from my body, my family knows it's time to celebrate a successful end to a mission! I find this product to be a great respite from the travails of leading a double life."
2,no box,the item came in with no box at all. i have no way of knowing if the items were used or not. the item was advertised in a box and the expectation at least for me is i should be getting what was pictured but alas nothing of that sort happened. definitely will not buy from that outfit again. ever!!
5,Love It Very Very Much,"I originally purchased the Multiclix lancets to use with my Accu Chek Aviva meter as Amazon lists the meter, the strips and lancets in a grouping of buy these together section ; ERROR the lancet that comes with the Accu Chek Aviva is the fastclix not the Multiclix , imagine my surprise when the drum was too big to fit.Oh well I immediately ordered the Multiclix lancing device and a box of Multiclix lancets from another Amazon vendor.The original order of multiclix arrived without a hassle,the box was sealed as expected.After using the multiclix device I've discovered it's easier to hold and prick your finger than with the fastclix, and it has the same ""painless"" prick as the fastclix.I use setting #1 and retrieve an adequate amount of blood for use.There is no instruction manual on using the multiclix , so you have to go to the Accu Chek website and download it.Otherwise a great product."
5,This really works,"Since taping this to the inside of my glass front door, I haven't been bothered by prosthelytizers for several months. Worth every penny to stop the bell ringing idiots."
5,great product,"This is a cute little thing, wonderfull for kids pics to give mom's on mothers day or grand parents on granparents day."
1,"Sharp screws it's ""friends and family""","Like others who have reviewed this tv, I too had problems dealing with Sharp. I had a code for ""friends and family"" which ended up costing me nothing but headaches. I will NEVER consider a Sharp product EVER again!"
4,"Very good TV, for a great price!",I looked at numerous big box stores and couldn't come close to the deal I received on this TV. I was nervous about buying a TV online but the process has been great so far. No issues with shipping or receiving the product.
5,Great action movie...,This is Segals best movie ever. The action is fast paced...the movie is never boring. The characters a well acted and Erica Elaniak (fine as ever). Fighting scenes are exceptional as in all Segals movies. The DVD format really increased the quality of sound..in fights and explotions. This is kinda old now but is a classic action movie. Definetly a buy..if not a rent. END
4,Watch this movie for Tommy Lee Jones' performance,"Seagal puts in a better performance than any of his other movies. But the best parts of this movie were the scenes totally stolen by Tommy Lee Jones. The conversation between Jones and his former CIA superior (""...deforestation, irreversibly progressive depletion of the global gene pool. It all adds up to oblivion, pal. Governments will fall, anarchies will reign. It's a brave new world."") is priceless, and matched only by Alan Rickman's list of demands in the original ""Die Hard."" If Marisa Tomei can win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in ""My Cousin Vinny,"" (which I loved, by the way) then Jones should have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in this movie. Jones (with Gary Busey pitching in to help in places) is the only thing that saves this movie from being a standard, cookie-cutter Seagal shoot-'em-up. Jones gets this movie two more stars than it would've had without him as William Strannix. Bravo!"
3,Not bluray worthy..,"I am in the process of trading in all my dvds for blurays. Under Siege is one of the movies I turned in for a bluray. I like this movie but the bluray quality is severely lacking. The only reason I do not regret getting it is because I like the bluray packaging better vs the dvd packaging. The reasons I still give it 3 stars is:1. I like this movie2. Amazon had it at a great price3. Bluray packaging (I know, that might be a dumb reason but I am weird that way.)"
2,this is NOT seagals best,"I dont know why people say this one is good. its soo bad. The only good things is Tommy Lee Jones, who does a really good performance. And thats all thats true about what i heard. There is not so much fight scenes as i expected, I thought this would be like 100 times better than the second, but it wasnt. The only fight scene worth to watch is the knife fight in the end..."
3,Action with a purpose,Seagal does a good job but the female lead was just unnecessary . She did display a great body but her character was just dumb.
3,Worthwhile for Seagal Fans,"This is one of Seagal's better films (funny how it still rates only 3 stars). Not quite as hardcore as some of his early fare, and not as preachy as his later films. A good mid-ground piece by a less-than-stellar actor. Still all the action and martial arts makes up for the lack of substantial plot. Clearly worth a watch."
3,"""I guess I won't get to see you go through puberty.""","This is definately not Steven Seagal's best movie. He just got too serious for his own good. Now if he had kept with lines from movies like Marked for Death, he would have done just fine. No notable performances here except Tommy Lee Jones as a rock star and Joseph F. Kosala as Engine Room Watch Officer. Who could forget his now-famous line, ""You guys stay calm down here, OK?"". If you want a good Steven Seagal movie, stick with Marked for Death. If you want a good violent movie, stick with Drunken Wu Tang. If you want a good movie, stick with Citizen Kane."
1,Out to Sea,"Seagal's immitation of Bruce Willis Die Hard pales in comparison. I've often wondered how Steven Seagal got a break in the movies. He seems possessed with the acting talents of a lawn gnome and his martial arts skills seem to consist of nothing more than a series of stunt men performing flips, slips and prat falls all around him everytime he blinks an eye. I would love to seem him in an actual M.A. competition, I don't believe he would get very far. He just seems too phoney to take seriously and as such, his movies suffer."
5,Under Seige,excellent action movie and the hero Steven Seagal is as always outstanding Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1,Pure Stupidity,"This is the worst action movie ever made, with the destroying of good actors like Gary Busey & Tommy Lee Jones who usual great actors in movies but they come off as lame, this rediculous action movie, where Steven Seagal doesn't get injured, it's just bufoon going doing killing that has no plot & even worst acting,it's more like a comdedy than an action movie if you think hard enough about it"
1,Waste of money,"After a few days of wearing it, the button, which holds the case on the belt clip, came out.I thought that the word ""skin"" in the title would indicate either leather or cowhide. In fact, it is neoprene, a plastic!I would have given the product 0 stars, but, that was not an option."
5,Excellent for a new Punk Band w/ a reminiscent old sound,"I picked this CD up on a whim in record store, I saw it in shelf and decided to give this new LA punk quartet a try and glad I did. This is coming from a person who grew up listening to The Jam, The Replacements, Pixies, old REM & The Clash. So this was completely new for me. I have to say this album is amazing every track is appealing its reminiscent of The Clash & The Jam sound. The leads singers voice sounds like Elvis Costello a little bit. Stand out tracks are Under Suspicion which is my fave on CD, Searching for Ground, Lovesick, & Turnaround. But every track on here is good. I was very surprised for a new quote on qoute punk band. I can't get it out of my CD player. One of the best albums of 2004. Very catchy album find yourself humming to the songs, you will not skip tracks on this one."
5,A masterpiece,"I have owned this album for ten years and never get tired of it. It's a bit of a departure from other Lush albums, mostly due to the fact that it was produced by the Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie. Sensuous and shimmering, it is an album to listen to late at night with your eyes closed and only the Christmas lights on. Guthrie's sense of beauty and Lush's intensity blend seamlessly here. At times dreamy, at times passionate, at times haunting, and in all cases beautiful, this album takes the ""otherwordly layered wall of sound"" that the Cocteau Twins pioneered and moves it in a unique direction."
1,Crochet Coats,The coat works up beautifully but is much larger than it says. Have tried a 3.5 hook and it is still 52 inches across the back. The small is supposed to be 42 inches using a 3.75 hook.Would appreciate any suggestions.
2,crocheted coats,"I was very disappointed in this book as it only had four coats to crochet, none of which was I interested in. One of the patterns was for the ""experienced"" crocheter because it was so complicated. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for the specific patterns in it."
2,Where is (Where The Action Is),The cd sounds great except for one thing they left out one of his biggest hits Where The Action Is.I would defiately go get another hots package that has everything
3,Woody Shaw revisited!,"While waiting for my wife to arrive on a late train, I heard ""Across The Bridge"" on the local jazz station. I woke up immediately as the tune reminded me of my Berklee College of Music days and a tune that I penned called ""Knowledge Of Self"". I stayed up another hour to learn the name of the tune and the artist, then logged onto Amazon later that morning and purchased the CD. The disc reminded me of Woody Shaw and his great volume of work, as well as Billy Harper and Rene McLean. The disc stayed in my CD player so long, that my wife begged me to put together a session to play some of the old tunes. Needless to say, I STILL enjoy a rotation or two of ConClave!"
2,High Level reference,This is a cross referenced listing of colleges by catagory. No real meat per college. I would go to the library to use it or spend $15 on the US News and World Report college site which gives you both high level sorting and detailed info.
2,OK for Guidance Counselors,"Rugg's recommendations is a comprehensive list service, with accompanying statistics for the colleges. It is well prepared but BEWARE! This is a reference tool for high school guidance offices rather than a primer for parents and students going through the search process. The summary of the book is misleading and I purchased it, thinking it would help my son and I to become more familiar with the colleges.I gave the bok to the guidance counselor and he is using it as a reference.I recommend the Fiske Book of Colleges, or a similar publication that contains very informative explanations for each college and also contains the statistics the Rugg's book contains."
5,Major guidance,Great book if you know your major and want assistance in choosing the schools to apply to.
4,Nice and cutre book,My 5 year old boy seem to enjoy the book. He does like counting a lot and I think he found the book fun. I would not say it is one he wants to read all the time since I try to get him to read it rather me reading to him but I think it s a good book.
5,Fun story,Cute story for beginning readers. Incorporates math skills along with learning to read. My daughter loves this book! Highly recommend.
1,Don't Waste (a lot) of Your Money on This Book,"I agree fully with David L. Stanley's review of this book. To spend over $60 on a publication that contains advertising is ridiculous. Granted, it does contain some useful technical information, but the bulk of this book serves as a diary of the author's adventures. If your looking for useful information when purchasing a Mercedes SL, there are plenty of other sources. For the price, this book might qualify as a coffee-table collectible, but its small size and print prevent even this. I will probably be throwing this one into the fire, so I won't be reminded in the future of how bad a ripoff it was."
3,Pretty Good.,"I like Bobby Darin and this is a reasonably good performance. However, compared to an Elvis show in Vegas during the same period, no contest."
4,This is my kind of stuff,The product came in in tact and it had a good experation date. I use it to keep my faily healthy.
4,An evolutionary elbum,"This is a very good album by Al Green which is a mixture of gospel and soul The songs are similar to the Belle album with more orchestration. If you are an Al Green fan , it should be added to your collection"
5,Its True!,"This book shows children that we may all be from different cultures, but in the simplest ways we are very much the same. It is a good first day of school book, or good multicultural education book!"
5,Awesome CD,"If I never buy another gospel cd in my life, it won't matter because this one will keep me praising HIM forever.The range of songs is full, the message is prolific and the delivery is awesome.I have purchased this cd three times and once on cassette....wore them all out....just keep replacing.Fred and RFC are truly annointed."
5,awesomely anointed,Once again Fred Hammond and RFC have truly blessed the body of Christ with their anointed songs of praise and worship. The ministry and healing power flows right through the system and into your spirit. Praise God for such a man as this!!!
5,Get Your Praise ON!,"THIS IS FROM THE GROUP DAMASCUS IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. Keep reminding us that God has not given us a spirit of fear, but the LORD has given us POWER. And no weapon formed against us will prosper. We will win because we are overcomers. Thanks FRED! You are an innovator and trendsetter. Love to work with you."
5,Pages of life Chapter I & II,i dont know where to begin. The Cd was so wonderful. And it really Blessed me as I listened to it.
4,Sweet Sax,"My favorite track on this album is ""Skylark"". Hamilton plays it with such sweetness and taste. Give a listen."
1,Too broad and lacks depth,"This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision. This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction. Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself. I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading."
5,Any serious seeker of truth must read this book.,"This book, and it's following Voyagers II, will let you see clearly: 1) Where are you from, 2) What are you doing here, 3)Where are you going and most important; 4) How to get there.Go slowly for there is a lot of information and take your time to grasp it, for it will be one of the most important imformation about you life, your true potential as a being and your purpose that you may come across.Once you red it go ahead and practice some of the exercises and you will never see your life in the same way for your true mission in life will be revealed to you (by you)."
2,Wasted space inside,"Yes it fits 20+ DVDs but when you put the DVDs on the 2 shelves inside there is so much wasted space above the DVDs, at least 4 inches. You are able to shove 2 more DVDs above each stack of DVDs but it looks bad. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,a predictable disappointment,"It's been years since I've been quite so tempted to throw a book in the garbage. Where was the character development? Where was the heart of this book? I felt as though I was reading a trashy romance novel vs. work by a Pulitzer pize winning author. I was disappointed in not only the cheapened content, yet the structure in writing about it. I felt absolutely NO connection between the characters, and therefore toward the book in general. The predictiblity is probably the biggest disappointment overall. If I wanted to read a perdictable romance, I would have picked it up at the supermarket, not in the literature section of a prominent bookstore."
2,dogs don't like,"My 2 dogs will accept these treats with a look of ""... and what am I supposed to do with this?"" They walk away slowly and then drop the biscuit. They do eat them, but with distain. One of their least favorite treats."
1,"To Me, These Songs Seem Pretty Mediocre","I guess if you were at a club and her song(s) came on, it(they) would get you out on the dance floor. But for my taste, these are so generic sound-like-every other Nashville songs, that I don't see why there have been so many favorable reviews. Where are the great (and unique) melodies?"
4,Flying High,"My nephew is crazy about planes so I knew he'd love this video. The surprise was that I loved it too! It was funny, exciting and entertaining. Even though we learned a lot, they slip it under the radar, so the kids never suspect they're watching something ""educational."""
3,Missing a few things,"Good phone overall but interestingly didn't have a speakerphone function or earphone plug in. If it had that, I think it would be fine."
4,Fast setup out of the box.,Nice phone with nice caller ID display. Fairly simple set up and directions were easy. I use a Plantronics head set with the phone and for some reason when you pick up the receiver you don't get a dial tone. May have to explore the manual to see why.Fast delivery time.
4,Panasonic KX-TSC11B,"Good Product, Display is user friendly, Numbers and ID are prominently displayed. Setup was no hassle. we are very satisfied with this purchase."
2,"defective, and Panasonic had horrible customer service","Phone came with defective handset. Called Panasonic and got the absolute run-around. Was given a fax number to get ""approval"" to return handset (rather than the whole phone, which seemed otherwise fine). No answer at fax number. Called Panasonic back, went through whole story, was given another fax number, that one didn't answer either. Third customer service rep didn't even try to help, just told me to return the phone to Amazon. I will, and I'll get a different phone NOT made by Panasonic!"
5,THOMASINA - THE CAT WHO THOUGHT SHE WAS GOD,"GREAT OLD BOOK, GLAD TO HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE.HE IS A GOOD AUTHOR I HAVE READ AND WILL READ MORE OF HIS BOOKS.BARBARA"
5,Made for a Movie!,I have been reading Fiction for almost four decades and have never been so impressed with a first effort. I have to say this would make a better movie than anything I have recently seen on the big screen. Best recommendation..grab a copy and give it a quick read..you'll probrably reread it a dozen times like I did. I hope there are more !!
3,results,i personally have been doing this workout on and off for years and have seen great results using it.
3,Good Flick...,This was actualy a good fantasy flick worth at least watching once. However the bottom line of this one is you will either like it or hate it so rent it first...
1,Terrible-Horrible-No Good-Very Bad Movie,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the movie was less than impressive. Its a classic example of how not to do a movie - no focus on the story and play up the special effects. The special effects were good, but seemed to soak up so much of the budget that the sets and costumes looked like they were straight off of Zena. The movie tried to do too many things - be sort of a fun, medieval knight movie like First Knight, a little bit of Star Wars, a little bit of Willow, and a little bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I swore scenes were taken from all of these movies and thrown together to create Dungeons and Dragons. There were also too many characters which didn't add to the story - they simply detracted from the main focus of the battle. Lines are also misdelivered where lines that should make you cry or cheer end up making you laugh because they sound so pitiful. I love movies and its not often I find one that I dislike so much...this movie was my dungeon."
1,Competition for Battlefield Earth,"This movie is competing with Battlefield Earth for being the worst movie ever made. First of all, did the concept designers ever even play D&D, or had they only heard about it? I personally found this to be more the plot you'd expect in a cheap fantasy novel than a well laid out D&D game.Aside from the general plot, I swear the dialog was written by a 2 year old. Rather than spend a few $ on a decent screenwriter they chose to have an annoyingly large number of badly-animated fly arounds of the stupid castle. This movie makes for some great MST3K roleplaying on your part, however.Finally, the acting. I recall Jeremy Irons no actually being that bad of an actor. After a long painful experience of watching this I finally concluded that the director, Courtney Solomon, is probably just clueless or had a BAD BAD 6 months. Either way, this movie was an experiment in the heat capacity of american dollars, and should probably be avoided, and rented for MST3K purposes."
2,Disappointing,"This movie was rented at my house shortly after it came out on video. I was aware of the 80's D and D game, and was eager to see what had been done to it on the big screen.Boy howdy, I sure am glad that it was rented, because paying for movie tickets would have been a huge rip-off! it started out okay, and I could tell it wasn't going to be a great movie. But not everything can be great, and lots of stuff that's so-so or okay can still be very enjoyable.Not this. The writing and story were awful. Some of the lines were terrible, and the villain and his accomplice... ugh! The ending was really bad and cliched as well. I can't think of a single character I remotely liked. I suppose if I HAD to choose one, I'd pick Damodar or Marina, but seriously, this movie is pretty bad."
3,"Not great, but not horrible.","I have never played D&D, but I am an avid player of online roleplaying games.. so I didn't go to the movie expecting something great. Because of that, I was entertained. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen - but it wasn't the worst.Some of the acting was overdone, some of the dialogue and costumes were wacky (the blue lipstick was just silly), but it was cute. The special effects were great (especially the dragons at the end) and most of the lead actors give decent performances.If you're looking for something serious, this isn't the movie for you...go see Lord of the Rings instead. If you go in to it with an open mind and just want to have some fun, you'll like it. Worse comes to worse, see it just so that you can make fun of it. ;)"
1,Even the nerds will hate it,This is close to the worst movie ever. Even the nerds who played this game that I used to religiously persecute back in High School would hate it. Did the producers of this film have balckmail on Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons that forced them to do this?
3,"REALLY bad, but in a good way","OK, you have to take this movie with a BIG grain of salt. It's very campy and silly, but it doesn't pretend to be anything more.If you picture the movie as being in the minds of a bunch of 13 year olds, hopped up on Jolt cola at 3am playing D&D, it not only makes perfect sense, it becomes a whole lot funnier... and a little sad at the same time."
1,How could someone make a movie so terribly retched?,"I was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set. If only i could go back in time and tell the 2 hour ago me not to watch this terrible excuse for a movie. While I was watching it I was thinking this movie's extremely bad, at least that funny black guys in it though. Then half way threw the movie funny black guy died, as did my thoughts of the movie being just extremely bad, it was more like terribly retched."
1,"Literally, the worst movie Ive ever seen..","I am a long time D&D fan, and I would have to say that this is quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. Total garbage acting and a cast that doesnt even come close to fitting in. A good title would of been ""Boyz in the Dungeon"", with Marlan Wayans flapping his stupid mouth the whole time. The only emotion I felt during the whole movie was Happiness, and that happened in 2 places, when Marlan Wayans dies and when the movie ended.. its just a shame they both didnt happen ALOT sooner!."
3,There was a lot of Potential,I am not a D & D player. Maybe that is why I found this film so enjoyable. I didn't see it for oscar worthy acting or airtight storylines. I saw it as a popcorn film. Thats what it is and it fills the requirements well.A lot of thought went into the production of this flighty movie. The film crew was not given a lot of money to work with. They came up with quite a bit considering. The Prague locales were droolingly lovely. In particular the mage's court room and the library. There was loving effort in the dragon special effects. Also there was some nice camera work.Jeremy Irons is so over the top that he is fun to watch. The rest of the cast was likeable.All in all this film is a nice way to waste a Saturday afternoon.
2,"Not very good, but bits are worth seeing","While abysmal scripting, and bland direction make this a low grade ""Evil Overlord"" flick that lamely tries to copy better examples of the genre (like Star Wars and Flash Gordon,) the film has enough good points to merit a view. Those include some really nifty fantasy costume & production designs, pretty animated effects, good fight choreography, a decent musical score, and a wonderful comedy/drama turn by Bruce Payne (in blue lipstick?) as the Evil Overlord's chief minion, Damodar. The DVD version has LOTS of amusing extras, and it's clearer, letterboxed image helps to make the film's chief attraction, its visuals, shine."
1,It was a waist of money and I only rented it!,"Horrible! I've been in therapy since seeing it ;-). I thought this looked like a cool picture with the trailer, but the trailer is the only thing good about it."
1,Horrible movie and not true to the game at all. Clerics?,"This movie is just horrible. Suffice it to say that the movie is a waste of time. I just wanted to point out the lack of any clerics in the movie. Even healing was done by some old elf using 'natural elven magic'. Also note the reference to ""God"" and ""praying"" (in most D&D campaigns a player would have to specify which god and hope they picked the right one). It seems like the studios were uptight about the polytheistic aspect of D&D, and eliminated one of the core player classes. Ya right. Lets just hope they dont to to Lord of the Rings what they did to this movie."
2,Not A Good Movie,"I would think with the name and hype of this movie they could have casted better actors or got a better director. Profion, an evil mage, seeks the power to control all of the dragons to take the kingdom od Izmer from the Empress Savina. The kingdom's fate falls into the hands of two peasants. With this movie I think too much money was spent on developing the special effects and not enough time on the script writing. This movie didn't seem to have much substance to it. There was a comical quirk here and there and then mass special effects and that was about all. Maybe we should just keep Dungeons and Dragons a roleplaying game for good. I recommend you rent this movie first and then decide whether or not you want to buy it."
1,Don't waste your time,"I guess most of the reviewers already wrote what I want to say...I probably watched around 200 movies in my life time (I know it's not much),but this one is at the bottom... well it may go underground.It's worse than battlefield earth, it's worse than any B type movie I've seen,it ain't just worth spending time watching it...Especially at the time LOTR came out, it's uncomparative..."
1,2 hours of my life I'll never have again,"Anyone rating this film probably works for the movie company, or has lost their marbles. It only gets one star from me because my girlfriend insisted we get it, and this howling error on her part gives me carte blanche rental choices for about the next decade.Bad dialogue, clumsily edited, atrocious acting, inconsistent motivations, no character development, colossal non-sequiturs, baffling ending and lead characters with all the pizazz of pork luncheon meat.Fantastic relief though when Marlon Wayan's ""Snails"" is bumped off by the slaphead with the blue-lipstick - ah yes, Snails the thief - as much use as a glass hammer.Don't believe the reviewers who claim that the extra scenes ""explain everything"" - they just add to the horror.It was just fantastically bad - don't buy it - for pity's sake - save your money. I'm going to stop now, because it just hurts too much to think about it."
1,Yawn,"Of all of the potential D&D stories that could have been developed for a film, and there are numerous excellent books in both the Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms titles, why did they have to make this monstrosity?!?!?!Why not an adaptation of something by Weiss and Hickman, or Salvatore?The effects range from basically good to outright cheesey, the plot is muddled and non-existent at times, and the acting generally so awful as to make you stare in wide-mouthed disbelief. And there are some talented actors in it. Jeremy Irons will regret this film for the rest of his life, I suspect.In the light of Lord of the Rings, which has raised the bar so high that nothing else compares, this film looks even stupider now than it did last December. Thank God that New Line had the Oscar-worthy LotR waiting in the wings with which to redeem itself.Give it a miss, unless you want a really good laugh, in which case go and rent it at Blockbuster and save some money."
5,"My Power Is Growing Darker, My Lord!","Keep rating 0 stars reviewer's as my power keeps growing stronger!It's mine, all mine."
2,Disappointed,"I too am a avid fan of d&d, I just bought the new 3rd edition books. This movie struck me as cheaply made and the acting was not good. The props/gems in the movie looked like plastic. I was embaressed to drag my friends to see this in the theatre. Compare this to Conan The Barbarian which was probably the best fantasy movie ever made even though it was in the '80s."
3,"[Three-and-a-half out of five] Well, in answer to the title's Q...","Harvey Leon Oswald, or as some call him,Lee Harvey Oswald didn't! He was picturedin the doorway of the Texas School BookDepository 20 sec(s) before the grassyknowl 'badgeman' [probably Roscoe L. White]fired the fatal head shot at JFK, killinghim! We're supposed to believe the old yarnthat Oswald, alledgedly on the sixth floorof the book depository, shooting down andbehind JFK's motorcade, at an 88 degreeangle, through a Texas live Oak tree, witha 34' foot spread, shot three magic bulletsinto the limo, causing eight non-fatal woundsand one fatal one, and the last bullet, thatpassed through two bodies, two seats, et, al,killed President Kennedy and caused six non-fatal wounds to then Texas Governor Connelly!Bushlip! And did you, Mr and Mrs America, hearthe one about 'Free Trade'?..."
1,Paradise Lost,"Even though its capacity is smaller, I chose Roadstor over a flash-HD for safety. I figured, when travelling I'd burn two CDs each time, keep one and mail the other home. Cheap insurance. If a flash-HD has problems I've lost all my pictures in one shot.Had 500+MB of data to transfer from a CF card.First attempt: Roadstor hung at 58% complete. Result: one (more) silver-colored drink coaster.Second attempt (with different brand of CD-R): burn completed successfully. Approximately half of the photos were fine, and the other half were garbage. Were covered in wierd color casts, portions of the right edge of the image were on the left, vice versa, all kinds of strange stuff.Verified in ACDSee, Paint Shop Pro and Irfanview on two different computers.Back it went for a refund. Even though it's an extra step, I'll find an internet cafe and burn my CDs off the flash HD.Roadstor doesn't even deserve one star."
5,Excellent source for Genesis insight,"This book is not for people who want to hear how inerrant the Old Testament is. Rather it is a fine example of what true Theological examination looks like. Gerhard von Rad takes Genesis and dissects it into fine details. Rarely does von Rad overlook a single detail. Taking into account language, history, and literary device, von Rad deals with Genesis in a way that will open up the stories into a new light, revealing pictures you've never even noticed before. Theist and atheist alike will find this commentary very insightful and useful in their study of Genesis."
1,Where in the world are the cartridges for this thing?,As a big Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Regis Philbin fan i was so glad that they put out the show on a handheld version so my parents gave it to me for a early Halloween present two years ago. I actually won the million the first week I had it. Now on to the bad news even though the packaging promises cartidges for this game three years have passed and still no cartridges have been made. I've tried everything:ie e/mailing Tiger/Hasbro calling toy stores everywhere and just about everything. I think Tiger/Hasbro rushed this version and other non Millionaire games for the holiday season. This is one of the main Millionaire items I take to Disneyland to practice to play on the new Disneyland attraction of the same name called Play It. This is a good game and a good practice tool that should be taken on any Disneyland and/or Disney World trip Buy it if you can.
2,good until you use it in saltwater,Nice real but never use it in saltwater. I used it once in saltwater and cleaned it out immediatly afterwards. The real hasn't been the same ever since - the real no longer reals smoothly.
1,One song CD,"This CD was a big disappointment. Only one track (""All About You"") is worth listening to. I first saw them in the ""All About You"" video and thought that they had harmony and potential. I suppose the production on the album wasn't good at all. Motown should've focused on these girls as much as they did on Boyz II Men in the early 90's, otherwise, there would be more from Pretty In Pink."
3,Pocket Rhyming Dictionary,I think this is just my oppion just because I have never used a rhyming dictionary before but in my oppion this is very hard to use.
3,"For me, not up to Oliver's usual standard","I bought this book because I'd loved everything else I've read by Patricia Oliver. Her series of linked books, using recurring characters, is entertaining and very enjoyable and I had initially hoped that this book would be another in the series. It isn't, unfortunately.It was well written, certainly, but the plot unfortunately did not grip me in the way her other books did. That's not to say it isn't a good and well-plotted book, just that for me it doesn't come up to the standard of 'An Unsuitable Match,' or 'Lord Gresham's Lady'."
2,A good illustration,This book is a good ilustration of how much damage Republicans have done to the USA and how the Tea Partiers are continuing the process....
1,E-learning companion,Nice clean book. It was in very good condition. I Never had to use it. A waste of money. Do not know why the instructor had us to buy it.
4,Wonderful book not without flaws!,"I love Rotties. I've owned four to date. I think they are the most wonderful dog: smart, loving, caring, selfless, loyal, dependable and protective. I love reading everything I can about them and this book was no exception. There is a great deal of information present, though, not without flaws. Some information is misleading while other info is just glanced over.Full of photos, color and black and white, I highly recommend it for fans or owners of Rottweiler breed. It is a great addition to the bookshelf."
4,The Michelin Guide,This book is not for amateurs who have never built speakers.Are you a fanatic the book is a must.It is a cookbook of the Michelin Guide level.
5,Awesome dry bag,"Very sturdy dry bag, larger capacity than expectd, which was a nice plus. Held up well to abuse we gave it on a one week trip in the BWCAW. Great buy, great price, great experience."
5,Dry bag purchase a success,"This bag is sturdy in material, seams, and hardware. The product was brand new, as indicated from the product description. I recomend a Sea Line dry bag to anyone in need of one."
2,Waiting for Gooper!,I bought this in haste as Gooper doesn't make a bag this size and I was leaving for a raft trip in just 2 days (thank you Amazon Prime!). I would have been better off with a bunch of ziplocks! Cheap materials and poor performance in general. I wrote Gooper to see if they're going to make bags like this (I love my Gooper phone case) but they said it'll be at least 6-8 months before their new stuff is available. I'll wait!
5,Water tight,"It was bigger than I expected and of better quality. Reinforced bottom, good company, and at $10.00 cheaper than the major chain with free prime shipping. The wife is happy to have a dry sleeping bag [along with other items] when we arrive at camp and life is good. The 30 was big enough to fit a change of clothes, shoes, compact sleeping bag, and a hygiene bag, toilet, matches, emergency kit, ect."
2,"This is a great album, but side 2 is shot.","I always fall asleep when I get to side 2. The best songs are 1-4, and 10-12. Michael W. Smith is starting to lose the energetic pump. Decent album."
4,A beautiful sounding album.,"Although Mr. Smith may not have the widest of vocal ranges, he nonetheless brings a considerable amount of heart to his work and that breathes life into this collection of mainstream tinged contemporary Christian music. The love ballad In My Arms Again along with the heartwrenching Hello, Goodbye make this album a must have. Highly recommended."
2,Runs out of plot.,"In the future (that looks like hundreds of years ago), the humans live in fear of the cyborgs who need their blood to survive.The first hour or so, it's a somewhat entertaining grade b adventure movie with below average actors (except Kris Kristofferson), stupid screenplay and cheap effects. After that it runs out of plot and the rest of the movie is long, boring, fighting scenes. The, suddenly it ends before the story is solved, giving a feeling that it's a pilot for a TV-series that was never made.This movie made me laugh a couple of times, mostly at scenes that probably weren't supposed to be funny, and you can see it without getting too bored, except for at the end. But it's absolutely not a good movie. Stupid screenplay and bad direction, and Kathy Long is pretty bad as the heroine. I wonder what made big actors like Kris Kristofferson and Lance Henriksen choose to be in this movie. Watch it only if it's on TV. Don't pay to see it."
3,Kathy Long Kicks Cyborg Butt in Low Budget Action Fashion,"This is a film from 1993 that stars kickboxing champ Kathy Long as a young woman seeking to get revenge for the death of her parents by evil cyborgs, led by Lance Henriksen who survive by drinking the blood of humans. Kris Kristofferson stars as a cyborg intent on destroying the evil cyborg gang to stop their quest to dominate the human race. He teaches Nea, Kathy Long's character, how to fight and kill the cyborgs. Lance Henriksen grimaces and grows at times like a real ham but at times he just seems kind of uninspired and bored. Well, he doesn't have much to work with. No one else really does either. There's not much of a plot really. Kathy Long is convincing as a buff female warrior and definitely has the athletic ability to pull of the fight scenes. Apparently this may have been intended as the beginning of a series of films but I don't think I have ever seen any signs that other movies have been made to continue the story."
5,A True Account of Human Spirit & Perseverance!,"Eddie Hunt is an outstanding example of human spirit & courage. A small town boy with a life rich in family, friends & hope for the future. Albeit gut wrenching at times, I could not put this book down! I can honestly say my life has become richer because of it. Eddie's candid & remarkable story will continue to touch my life and the lives of my family as my young son shares similar disabilities. I am proud to have grown up with the author in our native Stockton, California as he has always been a glorious example of community, American courage, determination, vitality, and fervent strength. I want to thank him for continuing to be this shining example & for sharing his ""Slide Through Time"".~"
3,Fun Thriller,"Taking place in both France and Algeria, Bedwin Hacker pits two women who were once top computer students and friends against one another."
2,Dont know,With the way the people acted who told me to get this book. I do not know if this really is the truth.
5,All time favorite,"I didnt know about this movie until a could years ago, and i had watched pretty much all of eastwoods old westerns. THIS however may well be his masterpeice. When he walks in that Bar at the end of the movie, and take on that entire posse by himself. The hair stands up on the back of your neck, LITERALLY. You can see the shock on there faces when they realize what they'll awakened"
5,Double the rating!,"This has to be the best movie of the 1990's! Eastwood, Freeman, Harris, and Hackman are superb! Saul Rubinek adds to the stellar-acting in his role as a visiting ""journalist.""This ain't your father's ""horse opera."" For that, we can be grateful."
1,UNforgivable!,"This is definitely the most boring western I've ever seen! What's even more amazing, is the fact that it won best picture! Clint Eastwood, I love most of your movies, but you are definitely unforgiven for making this snorefest! If you have insomnia, I guarantee this movie will help you get a good nights sleep!"
5,Very Happy...,Received this DVD quickly and in fine shape...this is a good place to get quality DVD's. Very satisfied...
1,Overdone,"I have seen all of Clint Eastwood's movies and they are all great. This is the worst of the worst, it is long without enough good content to keep you interested. The acting sucks, overdone. Nothing to look forward to or even anticipate! I have seen this movie only once and that is enough."
3,Boring,This must be rated high by viewers because of it's cast; certainly not as a result of it's quality as a movie.Midway through this film I forgot what it was all about then at 1h 5 mins I then remembered that the whore was cut up and her friends set a bounty on the cowboys who did the deed.It was then I realised how stupid it all was...the men cut up the whore ...so what !!( remember this is 1880 and women especially whores are there for the taking) and who in their right mind would kill for these unarmed whores when they can kill the whores and take the money.I completely forgot about the guys who cut up the prostitute;infact I felt no hatred for them as I normally would for a movie villian.In this town of big whisly the real villian seems to be within.
3,Unforgiven - Clint Eastwood,"I really enjoy Clint Eastwood's acting so I ordered this movie unseen, but the filthy language etc makes me regret purchasing this movie. I do not speak like this nor do I need to hear it."
3,Gift,I bought this as a gift for my dad. He loves this movie. Came in decent time and was a great value.
1,Not worth your money,Of the many books I bought on soap making this was the worst. It had no real information in it. It skimmed on all the topics but never really explained how or why. The books written in the early 1900 on soap were more helpful than this one.
3,Candles and Soap,"This book was shipped quickly but the outside of the book is dirty, it looks like something spilled on it and was not cleaned up, it was a little disappointing. But the inside of the book in is fine shape and I have found the book to be informative!"
1,very dry,In diary form...just not as good as expected. It is very dry reading compared to other Civil War diaries I have read
4,"It's Panasonic so it is rated a ""BUY IT"" by me!","Works great use as a home office phone. I like a phone with a cord between the receiver and body. No need for extra wall plug in devices. Will always work even if the house power is out.....as long as the phone line outside is still up. Has more features then it needs but not so many you can't figure out how to work the thing. I use mine on a desk and added the extra long hand set cord so I can get up and move around a little.One improvement could be to make the hand set heaver. Even though all parts work great and parts inside are getting smaller all the time; there is no need for this light a hand set. Makes the phone feel cheap when the quality is really good. Just my opinion. If I could figure out how to get into the hand set I would make it heavier myself. You will not be unhappy with this item. I recommend it as a ""BUY IT"" product!"
2,Not so great,"I usually like Panasonic products but this phone has a screen that is difficult to read in average room light, it DOES NOT have a message light, just a tiny icon on the screen. It eats rechargable batteries which last less than 4 weeks. I put in regular batteries and it's over two months and working fine. The ringer is not pleasant to hear, kind of electronic sounding. I would investigate choices more next time. Do not recommend this phone."
4,Great phone for the price - no speaker though,"This is a very reliable, easy to read phone (for all of you with aging eyes!)My only problem is that is doesnt have a speaker - which of course is my fault for assuming and not checking. It has a very easy memory function, which I love. All around for the price, a great, reliable phone."
2,Panasonic ks tsc11w telephone,"My opinion? This phone is a piece of crap. I have to hold a flashlight up against it to see the caller ID display. Also the sound quality is too low. When I called Panasonic for technical support, I never did get a live person on the phone."
1,Poor wall mount design,The wall mounting design was an after thought. This phone will not mount flush against the wall. It actually protudes about 4 inches and only mounts on one of the two factory wall supports. If it is in a high traffic area such as near a kitchen doorway the reciever will fall off the cradle with the slightest touch. This thing is going back!
5,ACTOR IS BORN !!!,Two thumbs up for this great up-coming classic. Leo was great and so was scene stealer James Madio along with Mark Wahlberg. I think James Madio Has Risen...Looking forward to watching his career. Movie holds you till the very end.
3,hi,this is a good movie. i loved it when i was a kid but it made me kinda gloomy afterward. still glad i own it
5,excellent,"I found this movie to be anything but boring. Well written, shot, and acted by all involved. Leonardo DiCaprio's superbly gritty performance proves he's not just another pretty face; he truly is a really talented actor. I hope the success of Titanic, and the subsequent adoration of teenyboppers, won't keep him from getting more great roles where he can really show his range like this."
2,A Real Mistake,"The first mistake was setting this movie in the present rather than the 60's. The juxtaposition of Carroll's confined claustrophobic catholic world vs. the allure of the street and heroin isnt that shocking in the context of todays headlines. This could have been an interesting movie but instead it retreads predictable junkie themes, withdrawals and rehabilitation in an insincere and forced way."
3,Drama at it's best,"I wouldn't have sit through the entire movie if the story lacked but eventually, after it's shady opening, narrated by DiCaprio's character, i became interested in the actual plot of the downfall of the protagonist. The better scenes in this movie involves the induction of supporting cast Mark Wahlberg, who makes the movie even more realistic and hard-hitting. It's a simple story of a frustrated adolesent taking drugs in prep-school suffering the torments of phedos such as the Coach and his teacher.The movie overall was entertaining but leaves you wondering at the end where does the character go from now and where are the other prominent characters of the story. If you like drama based on true stories and actual happenings of teen life, pick up Basketball Diaries."
4,"A gritty, realistic film with wonderful acting performances.","""The Basketball Diaries"" is a gritty, uncompromising look at a basically good guy's decent into heroin hell. The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is superb; the screenplay doesn't pull any punches. Realistic, shocking, eye-opening, the film gives DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg the chance to display their true talents and really ACT -- these fellows do a terrific job because it all looks so REAL. What a great film with an ending I guarantee you won't expect -- connoisseurs of fine films and DiCaprio fans should check it out -- this is a real movie with a real script and real acting, and the characters and storyline aren't larger than life. They're real as life, and that's not something you see on TV every day. END"
1,Not what I expected..,"Oh Leo.. why would you take this role?? I guess I can justify it since it was his early days. I rented this movie on whim. I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened. I guess next time I will read the back of the movie to save myself many months of nightmares and therapy."
4,Engrossing,"I had no idea what this film was about when I picked it up at block buster the other day. It was free for gold members, which I happen to be. Dicaprio and Ernie Hudson were in so I said, why not.I started watching the film and I thought, oh, this is a kids movie. The next thing I knew, Dicaprio was snorting cocaine with a hot chick who promised him the coke would make him superman in bed.And that's when the film grabbed me because I knew then that the kid was going to end up hooked. The film then depicts just how this happened to a promising young basketball player, who made way to many bad decisions in his formative years.Check this one out."
4,spanish doll,My took his hair out right away. He did like him for a while and learned some spanish from him.
1,"Maybe 20 percent useful info, the rest you already know","I agree with reviewer Maggin and am astonished at the number of great reviews for this book. The author's friends? Any adult could write most of this book off the top of her head. Where to get funding: personal funds (DUH!), the bank (DUH!). How to fire an employee? Sigh. This is generic stuff, most is not about web hosting in particular. Same with suggestions for advertising. Maybe if you are a person with zero business experience you will benefit from some of the generic advice, but you'd do just as well with a book from your local library about starting a business in general. I returned this book in the next mail."
4,Excellent reference,"This is a book you'll want to keep near your PC for reference everyday. If you're serious about host a web site, you should also get ""The Complete Web Hosting Kit Professional,"" which has TONS of practial how-to's as well as all the software you need to set up a web and e-mail server."
4,Can't go wrong with this one.,"Well, this is the ultimate biography of master driver Scottish John Young Stewart, a triple World Champion who had it all: speed, tactics, mechanical knowledge, consistency.The book is very well written."
3,Interesting read,"Although this was a good read, there were some situations that would not seem to be viable in that date and time. I feel a seasoned frontiersman would have had a little more savy than to have gotten caught up in some of the situations portrayed in the story."
2,This Kindle edition on William Cullen Bryant Poems lacks structure,"Even though I am a real fan of William Cullen Bryant's poems -- to me, Thanatopsis rates as possibly the best -- this Kindle edition was a real disappointment. The poems run together with no clear breaks or structure. If you are looking for a particular poem, you have no choice but to scroll through page after page, looking carefully until you find what you are looking for."
4,Another amazing CD by Andrew W.K.,"Im A big Andrew W.K. fan, so when I picked up his new album ""the Wolfe"", I knew I would love it. To my suprise I found it better then my expectations. Its so well put together. With a mix of pop/rock/techno/speed, The Wolfe is sure to please many with its array of songs. Whats even better is how all of the tracks flow together so well, and they all have this great 80's feel. Its an awesome follow-up to his last album, ""We Want Fun"". Congrates Andrew, this CD is awesome !"
2,Whatever happened to the poet?,"First of all, I would like to say I'm an avid fan of WK's work, and would never say anything bad about him until I heard this album...What happened to the sweeping orchestral chorus' of the last album? Where has the angelic voice gone? And where have the poetic, subtle clever lyrics gone?It's like he's changed from a modern romantic to a heavy metal party animal overnight - I for one am confused.2 stars."
5,the best album I ever bought,Andrew W.K. is like a god he takes care of hiss people and creates some of the best music I have ever heard in my entire life. This album is or will be one of the best investments in music you have ever made. AWK write very energetic songs with great feeling this album should be in every home around the world it makes a great gift for everyone even kids because there is no foul language or explicit content at all. Buy the album you'll love it trust me and for more information check out Andrewwk.com/ for more information and song samples.Brandon
1,Doesn't work,"Set timer, plugged item in, I saw the Icon change at the appropriate time, but no power to the outlets. It Simply Doesn't work."
5,Excellent C++ RAD environment for begginers on up!,"For those of us coming from the MS world, C++ Builder does for C++ what Visual Basic did for Basic years ago. This is an excellent package. It's far easier to work with than Microsoft's Visual C++.The only problem is that there is not a lot of documentation on the market for C++ Builder. ""C++ Builder How-To"" by the Waite Group Press is very good, but doesn't go into enough depth.You won't regret getting this one."
3,potholder review,"It's a beautiful pink color, but a little bit on the stiff side for me. I mainly use it for decoration."
5,Favorite Book,"This is my favorite book ever. I loved it because it was one of the most motivational books I have ever read, and the best part about it was its all true. I think everyone, not just athletes, can relate to Lance's life and in some way walk away from the book inspired in some way. It was also well written and very absorbing. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
1,Not a winner,"Read the book, what a fake, fiction at best and can only say, better books to be read, better time to be spent."
1,Pathological Liar,"Now in January 2013, Lance Armstrong has been backed into a corner and has finally confessed to using drugs and doping in all seven of his Tour de France wins and has admitted that he is a bully and liar. George W. Bush and Lance Armstrong are good friends. Now we see why: they both are pathological liars who don't mind destroying people's lives. Can we believe Armstrong's version of his struggle with cancer or is it filled with exaggerations and fabrications?"
3,Insightful and inspiring.,"Pre-cancer, I didn't care much for Lance Armstrong. Although an excellent cyclist, he had an ego and arrogance that was far bigger than his tallent.Post-cancer, I saw a dramatic change in his personality (not to mention ability as a cyclist).This book gives a very good insight into what makes him tick. For instance, it was a little easier to understand his pre-cancer ego.The writing in this book is simple, as if he dictated it into a tape recorder. This is not distracting to the story, but is not as rewarding as other biographies I have read.Overall, this is a good read. It shows how one person with determination can overcome anything."
5,READ THIS BOOK: It changed me. Beautiful writing.,"I picked up this book in the juice store in San Jose on a trip. Someone I knew had given a moving speech on Lance, and I love inspiring stories. I have read a few. None, and I mean none so damn well written. The words, the descriptions, and the story, is so deep, and so well-written, that it was incredibly hard to put down. You start to get to know a real person, and all his defeats, his hardship, his anger, and his emergence as a real winner in face of it all. It is the best read in all of my carefully selected dozen books in the last few months. I highly recommend it!!! I love you Lance Armstrong! You are amazing!!"
5,A Winner,"This is Lance Armstrong's story through the first Tour De France victory.I admit, cycling does (did) not particularly interest me. That confessed, I have followed the Tour De France from the days of Greg LeMond enough to know who wins.Armstrong's story of growing up with a single parent, surviving cancer, falling in love, winning the Tour De France and having a child is detailed in ""It's Not about the Bike"" and is riveting in its frankness. Armstrong does not attempt to be politically correct and his humanity touches the reader.I have had this book sitting unread on my bookshelf for several years. That is regrettable.I was slightly amused and then saddened when reading passages in the book about Kristen, Lance's love, wife and mother of his three children. The fairytale is only slightly blemished by Lance moving onto to another love.Five stars."
1,Disappointing,"It is a shame that a guy that invites everyone to learn about his personal triumphs could leave the people that helped him through his painful struggles with cancer. We read an entire chapter dedicated to how amazing his ex-wife Kristin is and he lets us down by wanting to be Lance Armstrong Superstar more than Lance Armstrong Husband/ Dad. I don't know all of the facts surrounding his personal life, but my wife did go through in-vetro fertilization. It is an incredibly uncomfortable and invasive procedure for women. She gave him 3 beautiful kids, and he blew it. Great athlete, yes. Great story about overcoming the odds, yes. Great guy, no."
4,Read it in two sittings,"Lance Armstrong comes across as a very honest and strong person. I'd be honored to meet him. The book has a great balance between the tale of his cancer, his athletic achievements, and his family. I wonder what Armstrong will do with his life next; one can't see him resting after his cycling career."
5,Book Review for It's Not About the Bike,"This book is a very detailed novel of Lance Armstrongs childhood, cancer survivorship and his life after cancer. I thought this book was excellent and it gives a new perspective on life. The way this book was written, it made me feel like I was really close to Lance Armstrong and I could almost relate to his feelings and emotions through the whole story, even though I have never had cancer. After I had read the book, I felt like I wanted to read more about Lances life. I would recomend this book for someone that likes true stories, or someone who would like a new perspective on life."
5,The Most Intense Inspiration,"If you can read this book without becoming caught up in Armstrong's struggle and inspiration, you're a pretty tough nut--if I can use that expression in this context. Huge kudos to Sally Jenkins for telling Lance's story without diluting any of his true voice and character. The book is extremely well-written and riveting from the first words. Whether you are an avid cycling fan or not, this a story of human drama that transcends the pro sport aspect and becomes simply a tale told beautifully--no holds barred."
5,andles@paradise.net.nz,"If you are expecting to find the answers to life's questions, you might be disappointed. If you want a damn good read, to be inspired by bravery and a story of personal growth, better understand professional cycling and cyclists and not put the book down for a day or two, you'll enjoy this very much as I did."
5,Breathtaking,"Things may change fast in your life as this book shows. But you are what you think you are and you become what you think you become. Lance shows that it is true. If you think your life leads nowhere or you are bored by it, then read this book. It will remind you of what is important and what not."
1,Seems a bit to big for cycling shorts,"I was excited to read this book as I am an avid cyclist and triathlete. I was very disappointed. Lance describes his journey through his career in an almost cavalier, "" I deserve it all"" sort of manner. He lacks an attitude of appreciation, humility, and respect that I believe other elite athletes have shown (e.g. Mike Singletary, Arnold Palmer, Joe Montanna, etc.) I must admit his experience with cancer was horrific and I am glad that he can be an inspiration to others that face the same trials. Unfortunately, the predominant theme that I took away from the book was his attitude of arrogance, pride and self-indulgence. Before reading this book, I was prepared to root Lance to his fifth Tour de France Victory. Now I hope he looses, it would do his tremendous ego some good."
5,a story everyone should read,"I just finished Lance's book two days ago and I found it heartwarming and inspirational. I can personally relate to his struggle with cancer as my husband was diagnosed with stage three testicular cancer in 1993. We went through the chemo, the fears, the blood tests, the cat scans and all the side effects. We already had a family-seven kids aged 9 months to 11 years at the time, and it was a great struggle. My husband never talked much after his remission and eventual cure. I am grateful to Lance Armstrong for being a spokesman for this disease and for his courage. And I agree with him-""It's not about the bike."""
1,Didn't you learn anything??,"Lance, it's not about the bike. It's about generalizing your pain to other people, it is about tolerance, understanding, kindness, compassion, forgiveness. Unfortunately, you just didn't get it!"
4,"It's Good, But Sappy At Times!","Yes, I agree with all the other reviews that it is GOOD. However, it's VERY CUTESY, CUTESY when it comes to descriptions of his wife (is he sucking up or what?).I am a HUGE Lance fan, and have followed his career for the last 12 years or so, back when he was a triathlete.Yes, buy it. However, it can be corny at times."
5,Remarkable Insights Presented,"Lance Armstrong presents insights about his struggle with impossible adversity which clearly demonstrate a miraculous overcoming unimaginable odds. As a scientist and an endurance cyclist, my skeptical response changed shortly after swallowing whole the first few chapters as though they were but a page in length. Besides the respect most cyclists share for the 3-time Tour de France Champion, like prose set to motion, this book generated an exponential respect for Mr. Armstrong as person of heroic proportion. Very well done, indeed..."
4,Lance's Incredible Journey,"In Lance Armstrong's book ""It's not about the bike"" I thought it was an excellent book.The book is very well written. He explained how he had a rough childhood and how he started cycling, he took us through his races, and he described his cancer in every little detail not a single thing was left unsaid. He made you feel like you were on the bike next to him or sitting in the hospital room with him. He took you on an emotional roller coaster ride with all of the emotions running through his head you will have the same feelings reading the book. If you read this book it will motivate you and inspire you not to give up on your dreams and when an obstacle gets in your way you have to try your hardest to get through it and eventually you will overcome it."
2,The book was just OK.,"I'm not a biking enthusiast, but I read this book upon the recommendation of my husband, who would give it an emphatic 5 stars. I thought that I would be uplifted and inspired, but, well, it actually made me like Lance Armstrong a little less. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but, according to the book, he wasn't really very nice to the people around him as he went through his ordeals, and he doesn't waste much time thanking anyone. And did he really get the owner of Oakley to force an insurance company to cover the costs of his cancer treatment? Great for him, but all he did was pass the cost of his treatment on to other policyholders who made sure that their premiums were paid. I wish I would have like this book, but I can't say that I did."
4,"Very inspirational, you have to read.","If you are thinking your life is the greatest or the worst, you have to read this book. This case is about the cancer, about the triumph, about the way with better things than others.Lance Amstrong, no doubt, is a shining case in the cyclism history and a proof of life."
3,Read between the lines,I have read books autobiography's and the closest this one comes to was one on Arnonld Schwarzenegger and this one reminds me of that. To say that this man is self absorbed would be an understatement. I have not finished the book and it does read well. The only thing I see redeaming about him is he knows how to ride a bike well. He sounds pompus and spoiled and of course from what I heard he is not well spoken either. He maybe a champion in others eyes but not in my book. Grow up Lance lets talk in 10 years.
3,Book of hope,"I like this book. It is very interesting and very hopeful book. I highly recommend this book for everybody. It is very easy to read and very interesting book. I t is also a good source of information for bike riders and for ordinary people, because nobody knows what they may face in their future: good health or a disease.This book is hopeful, because even though Lance got sick, after he thought about himself as an invincible person, he got a good treatment. After three years he fully got back to himself and become a big winner of ¡Tour de France¡ for three years in a row. I hope he will win this year too. One day at the press conference Lance said ¡ I¡m determined to fight this disease. And I will win ¡I think this is the most important sentence in this book, it is not only important for his disease, bat also for his life. I guess the ¡will to win¡ is very important for everybody¡s whole life."
1,Maybe it isn't all we thought it would be,It all just sounds too good to be true to me. Perhaps this book could be re-assigned to the fiction section? Or great crimes of the 21st century?
4,It's not about the bike: It is about the being the best!,"I am a beginner runner. I picked up this book because I wanted to know more about Lance Armstrong. This book has taught me how much mental and physical training are required to be the best, consistently. I have enjoyed reading this book because of the humor, the clear and direct expression of ideas, and Lance's candor in his failures and triumphs. I am sure I will pick it up and read it again periodically."
5,Pure inspiration,I have never been as inspired as I was after finishing Lance's book. Lance shows us what it is like to thrive in life. I truly feel that his determination is what cured his cancer. He shows us that attitude is everything. Anyone who is serious about life and making the most of your life should read this book. Lance's story is PURE INSPIRATION.
4,The Miracle Man,It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life was an amazing book. This book showed all of Lance Armstrong's struggles and victories. I always see him on T.V. and never thought twice that he had it really hard and his life was on the line. I am amazed by what he has done and now I am more educated by reading this book.
4,About people not bikes,This is a great book ... especially since Lance has now won seven Tour de France races ! I admired his perserverance getting through cancer and climbing back on the bicycle to continue training. He is definitely right that cancer makes you think about the people near you much more -- his girlfriend / wife and eventually his son. The details of his emotional reaction to learning about his cancer were very helpful to understand what cancer patients go through.
5,Hy hero,"I'm a 14 year old, and Lance Armsrong is my hero. This book is about Lance's life, his fight against cancer, riding and being a good father. Anyone who loves bicycling as much as I do should love this book. It's amazing how much Lance whent though to get this far. This book covers from birth,school,and racing. Up to his win in the Tour!I don't want to give it a way all I have to say is, Way to go Lance!"
5,A Must-Read,"This is a truly amazing novel. Lance shows no signs of being avaricious but isn't afraid to tell it like it is. The book begins talking about Lance's childhood and racing before cancer. It painfully documents his onerous battle with cancer. But the reader is rewarded at the end with a truly uplifting payoff. I enjoy this novel so much that I could not put it down. I don't recommend to children under twelve because of the cursing. It is more of an adult book. But other then that, this book is a must-read."
4,Tour de Lance,I think this is one of the most amazing book about one og cycling's living legends. Definitely a must read for all cycling fanatics. Two Thumbs UP
1,Egotism Gone Wild,"Lance is a mystery to most americans who only idolize winners. In Europe, where they know cycling, he is almost universally disliked, not just because he is a doper, but because it reallyis about the bike, and his own personal fame.This book is an ""I love Lance book"" written by Lance! Don't waste your time."
2,not enough songs,"I was dissappointed in this in that he doesn't teach enough songs. It wasn't a bad dvd, and I appreciated him teaching the EaEA tuning but not enough songs."
2,This collection does not represent this fine band,The band is great but this collection is not...find others from Head East and discover the rich rock sound of their hits of the 70s.
3,Reggae Red,"It just surprises me when there happens to be a lot of great music from the U.K. these days. Simply Red definitely took it all the way there, but not as accepted here as they were in the 80's. The song Night Nurse, from the 1998 record, Blue, is a acclaimed rhythm of soul, R&B, and reggae combined in one melody. Although the song is pretty good, it still could've used a little something else to the mix. It just doesn't seem to catch on as heavily as If You Don't Know Me By Now as a staple to Mick Hucknall and company. Still, it has a great beat and is very interesting to try. Try getting Blue from Simply Red, if you want to hear this track."
5,Screamin' Stompin' and Rockin'!,"This CD is a drug. A drug to keep you from withdrawl between live shows. These guys rock with a level of energy that is remarkable. Tight bass lines, steady and authoritative drum beats. Guitar riffs that flow like water and sound like heaven. Vocals are edgy yet refined at the same time. Lyrics are humorous and heartfelt. These guys roll it all up into a super tight rock package and deliver it loud. Buy it-love it."
4,Advance stage of making candles,"The book show an advance stage of making candles but you find out very usefull to use the projects when your business start to grow. The projects to mold the candles and create a sculpture needs to improve in the explanation of ""how to mold"" to format a wizard for example. I think an artist in sculpture has no problem, but I am a beginner, I need to wait to try such techniques. I recommend this book for people in a advanced stage in the art of making candles."
5,Nice hobby,This is a good book if your interested learning to make all sorts of beautiful candles. Im a beginner and have learned alot.
4,Classy!,I bought this set so I can feel fancy while I drink my cheap whiskey. I leave the more expensive stuff in the bottles so people know what it is and usually keep this decanter full of Evan Williams. The glasses and decanter are both heavy and feel expensive. The silver plated tray that came with the set got tarnished and them started rusting so I threw it away.
4,I Like It,It looks very nice. Mine had a small air bubble in the crystal but it's on the bottom of the stop and not visable - I didn't think it was a big deal. The tray does look a little cheap but not bad enough that I don't use it. It still classed up the look of my counter and is a great deal for the money.
1,never got it,"I don't wan to give this any stars, they sent the wrong item ,got it 2 days before Christmas,called the company never got any call backs. Would tell everyone not to order fro them!"
1,Not as Pictured,"Though the packaging states Godinger Dublin, the decanter I received has a different design and lid (flat and square). If you do a search for Godinger Dublin Whiskey on Amazon the one I received when ordering THIS one is THAT one. Not pleased. Also, the tray is a pretty cheap and flimsy affair, and setting this next to my decanters from Waterford makes it look like glass next to crystal. Be forewarned. You don't get what you pay for here.To make it worse, I would avoid all Godinger decanters with this flat/square-type of stopper because it isn't level and is unsightly.I like the design of this decanter as pictured but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Very Nice Set,"Received this decanter set today. Great packaging and quick delivery. The decanter is really beautiful, as are the glasses, and the tray is nice but average to poor quality. Keeping in mind that this is not high-end, fine crystal, it does however make a lovely showing. Great set for the money. Recommend set and seller. Gave it 4 stars due to tray quality."
5,Makes a great gift for Him!,"Ordered this as a Christmas present for that ""impossible to buy for"" guy of mine. When the box arrived and I inspected the set I was very impressed. The crystal is made by Shannon Crystal in Ireland and is a very nicely cut set. The silver tray is sturdy and looks great. I know my guy will love it, and I bet yours will too!"
2,Lead Decanter,The set looks nice. Just make sure you are aware that this decanter is made with lead crystal. I did not realize it when I bought it for someone as a gift. I had to return it (which meant taking it to a UPS store and paying for the return shipping which was not cheap) and they take a 15% restocking fee.
2,A treatise on the authors life experience,"If you want to read about the authors life experiences rather than keeping, breeding and care of Angelfish, this book is for you. I ordered it thinking it would deal with the latter, not the former and was ratherdisapointed in its contents. I suppose that Drs. Axelrod and Burger have led active tropical fish hunting expeditions and thought they should share their adventures with the readers. I think you would be better off with an early edition of William T. Innes ""Exotic Aquarium Fish"". It has a detailed write-up on the keeping, breeding and care of fresh water Angelfish. Although this book has been out of print for many years, It may still be available on eBay or gathering dust in some book stores."
2,Kind of Dry History,"This book was full of history and an indictment of Saudi Arabia, but it was kind of dry to sit and read. If you like politics and history of the Saudi Government, you will find this book appealing. Christ is King!"
3,pretty good book,"I read this book from start to finish. At first I wasn't sure I could make it through, but then I did. So I am very proud of myself. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to others, because I wasn't paying careful attention. But there you go."
4,A good insight into Saudi Arabia's dealings with Islamism,"Hatreds Kingdom is a good book that explains the history of the branch of Islam called Wahhabism. Some say that Wahhabism is no longer active in the world but it is alive and well in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The book is very informative of the modern and global threat of this radical ideology of Wahhabism and how it has spawned and is currently nurtured in Saudi Arabia. The book clearly illustrates one of the main drives of the on going battle of East vs. West which is the hatred and religious intolerance that is taught in the radical form of Sunni Islam named Wahhabism. Though Dore Gold has a bias opinion, which is evident, the book still is very informative. I would recommend this book if you are interested in Islamic Terrorism and the roots of its hatred."
1,let's chase the extermists from both sides,"After reading this book i have realized who is full of haterd its those pepole who are trying to triger wars and conflicts by poisning peples minds with lies.I feel very sad when i read such books which are written by pepole with known backgrounds and intersts.its an advice for every one looking for the truth, do not read about a nation from their enemis, isralis and arabs are in war for almost a century now.I'm not defending the saudi's but i cant accept to accuse any pepole's relligon with terrorism."
2,Not as pictured,"The shackles pictured had a left and right cuff, different from each other. The product received had 2 identical shackles conected with a chain which has one cuff pointing upward and the other one downward. I did not mind the cheapness of the product, but I did want it to appear as pictured in the photograph. I gave them away."
5,Relationshps???,Relationships are very complicated. This workbook helps to break down an individuals personal expectations in the relationship. Very useful. Highly recommended.
4,Episodes according to Disney,"If you're like me, you're looking for a summary of the episodes included so that you don't end up disappointing the children with duplicates.The Disney site shows the following: --Arkansas to the Pacific Northwest, fun, friendship and surprises await when you Go To America! Drum up excitement with Quincy and the Team as you journey to the Ozark Mountains with Tapper, an Ivory Billed Woodpecker. First, however, you'll have to get through a mysterious swamp with help from transforming ""Swamp Boat Rocket!"" but watch out for alligators! Then, rescue Leo's Music Pet, Melody, from the bottom of Utah's Cataract Canyon, and explore an icy cave in Alaska. Whether you're hiking, floating, skiing or soaring, you'll discover nonstop adventure and breathtaking scenery with the Little Einsteins--"
4,Good Desk Reference,"This is a good desk reference dicationary with many of the more common Arabic/English words in it and is fairly easy to use. If you're looking for a basic dictionary, this is a pretty good one. The Arabic words are printed without the short vowels, but the transliteration in English is printed beside each Arabic word, otherwise, the dictionary would not be useful for learning the pronunciation of new words. I recommend this dictionary to Arabic speakers looking to learn English and to English speakers looking to learn Arabic."
1,An absolutely awful dictionary,"I've been studying Arabic pretty intensely for the past 40 weeks: 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. This dictionary is awful to the point of worthlessness. Without giving proper context, the definitions are often wrong or are infrequently used synonyms. By stripping away the underlying root system, it actually harms learning. If you must have an English-Arabic dictionary, get the Oxford, though you're better off just using Google translate. Spend the money and invest the time to learn to use Hans Wehr well but don't bother with this book."
2,Too much time time spent to get it working,"However my experience is with Windows 98SE. I bought this motherboard just because the only one supporting it in oder to minimize the installation work.I use this computer only for Internet access and ""home-office"" purpose just not to have to turn my workstation on. For this purpose (once you are able to make it working) it may be OK.If you have time to waste and no computer upgrade needing it may be OK.Not shure it can be OK: yesterday (a couple of day after above review) it stopped to work and I am waiting for customer support suggestions."
3,miracle of Aloe Resacea Cream,Does not help me at all. Would not buy it again.Have nothing more to say about it.Sorry about this.
1,Did not light,"I'm guessing it's a faulty design, because it didn't light up even though we gave it lots of time in the sun."
3,It's been along time since high school,"I'm not sure what happened. I loved this book in high school. Wanting to read it forty years later was a mistake on my part. It's Throreau for goodness sakes, you have to read at least once. Twice? Nu uh."
1,Be warned!!,"Don't read this book if you want to learn about the man that was Hamilton. If your only interest is the politics and financial events of his day then this is the book for you. There is little or no discussion about Hamiltons personal life, his children, his habits, his wife, his education, his thoughts, his friends, even his death and the events arounding it are but a few paragraphs. Look elsewhere to learn about Hamilton."
2,Lack of objectivity overshadows any good points,"The author of this book is so enamored of Hamilton that it completely blinds him to any faults Hamilton may have had. Furthermore, anyone who showed any opposition at all to anything Hamilton proposed is deemed either delusional or a traitor. His treatment of Jefferson and Adams is amazingly disrespectful. Even Washington comes accross as a feeble leader at times without the constant support and advice of his most trusted advisor Hamilton.As the book progresses, the bias gets worse and almost preachy.Shockingly, the famous duel with Aaron Burr gets only about 3 pages worth of description.....probably since it was not exactly a high point in his life.Avoid this book if you want a well-balanced biography."
1,Cheap...,"Lots of typos, and no search capability. OK, if you're desperate for the Holmes stories on CD-Rom, and can't afford something better."
3,"Good book, lots of typos","The books are great, I've been reading this non-stop since I received it. However, there are several typos, which is the reason for the 3 stars. The typos are easy to ignore and do not really change the meaning of the sentences at all, they are just annoying to me."
5,What a wonderful book.,This book makes you feel like you are there as Jesus is crucified. You can almost feel the suffering as He weeps in the Garden or the ache as He carries His cross. Very powerful. Should be recommended reading.
5,Best tea I've ever had,"Although there were serious probblems ordering this tea, it was well worth the wait. Amazon is now able to send all six boxes when you order. The tea is very strong and flavorful. It does make a proper English cup of tea."
5,Pretty good,"30 seconds to mars are and excellent band and this definitely an addictive album... I just couldn't stop hearing all songs over and over again. Guess everybody who listened to the previous album and bought this one found a powerful musical growth in ""A Beautiful Lie"". Leto's vocals fit impressively well in their alternative well-cared-sound. I'm from Portugal (Lisbon) and there's already a pretty good amount of fans over here.=D"
2,Good...but not that good.,"Obviously when a band releases their sophmore album people immediately compare it to the first one. I will do that in a minute. In situations like these, I try and hear the new album as independant so I don't develop a biased opinion. This album is good, but it is nothing too special. It has a hint of progressive rock that is overshadowed more by its ""mainstreamish"" pop sound; WHEREAS the first album had a more futuristic, original sound. I honestly liked the band better on that album, even though it wasn't really a ""band"" persay. This album just lacks the originality I like to hear and has been robbed of the credibility on the s/t release. I'd say it is above Fall Out Boy, but way below Tool on terms of originality. And I am in no way literally comparing these bands so I don't want to hear anyone bitching, but 30STM would be closer to Fall Out Boy on the spectrum than Tool."
5,Excellent Material..even better than the first album,"When I was studying in Europe 2 years ago i heard this band for the first time, they were known by a few but considered as a great ""experiment"" by actor Letto. I just bought their second cd and i think it is great, excellent if i may say so. I am impressed and I highly recommend ""Attack"", ""Beautiful Lie"", ""Was it a Dream"" and ""From Yesterday"". A must have!"
5,Great tool sharpener,Great tool. I carry it around the garden and sharpen my tools as I use them. Supper invention.
1,A Waste of My Hard Earned Money,"This Corona Clipper AC 8300 Sharpening Tool will ruin nearly every blade you apply it to.When given the choice I allows chose to buy Corona tools all my life. They are good quality tools. But this sharpener has no control to it. The carbide is extremely sharp and will remove material from just about any tool you have. The problem is the small amount of surface area in contact with the edge being sharpend. This allows for gouging to occur even with the slightest pressure. I ruined two pairs of scissors and had to spend an hour with my honing stones to repair the edge on my pruner.Corona should be ashamed to place their name on this tool. The only reason I can see for doing so, is that their competitors sell the same style sharpener. So, Corona is just trying to get you to spend that little bit extra of your hard earned money. Save your cash and stick with your honing stones."
4,there's only one reason I would'nt buy this,"This tool shaves knife edges so smooth with ease * LOTS OF BANG FOR THE BUCK * I feel like this will last me forever the only issue I have with this tool is ( It's just an 1"" TO BIG ) IT STILL FITS INTO THE POCKET but when you sit down you can feel it"
5,Best Carving Magazine,I think this is the best carving magazine on the market. I wish you got 6 issues a year instead of 4. There is always something to carve from beginner to professional. I have carved many things from here. It is fun to go on the fox hunt too. There is a section for shows and seminars also. I recommend this to any carver or woodburner.
3,Out of control is right!,"Interesting, well-written cheerleading book for the viewpoint that physics is dead and that biology/Darwin (whatever that means) is the model for economics, bla bla bla. Never mind that the catch phrase 'self-organization' is undefined and may never be defined. For Haken and Prigogine it seemed originally to mean a bifurcation of a relatively mild type. Later we learned that bifurcations can lead to chaos and even to complexity. What is missing from this book is 'real' complexity: DNA in solution can compute, Newtonian mechanics with 3 degrees of freedom may have Turing machine complexity, etc. I read and enjoyed this book several years ago. I wanted to see what wild, fantastic claims the opposition makes, and what they take for granted. Read critically, not too enthusiastically!"
3,The author is out of control,"This is a fascinating, well-written account of the popular notion that physics is dead and that the model for the future is biology. The problem with this is vagueness: there are no known mathematical laws of 'biology'. Even in genetics, then only mathematical laws arise from the physics of the genes. The idea of short-circuiting physics is charming but dead wrong. As Wigner pointed out, the discovery of laws of (time-evolution of) nature is impossible without underlying invariance principles, and there are no known laws of invariance for socio-economic behavior. Enjoy the book-it's the best and clearest 'cheerrleading' account savailable of the Santa Fe Institute philosophy, but take it with two or three grains of salt (and don't neglect to sign up for physics while you're at it). An excellent book that explains how mathematical laws of nature were discovered is J. Barbour's ""Absolute or Relative motion""."
5,Fun & Educational - Wonderful Way To Begin Learning Spanish,"Learning a second or third language is easiest when you're young and the process can be lots of fun for children. Little's Lizzie Spanish speaking doll is a terrific way to give a child a head start speaking Spanish. She is a soft, cuddly stuffed doll and when her hands and/or knees are pressed Lizzie will say up to 30 phrases - first in English, then in Spanish. She counts too! The doll is 16 inches high and adorable, dressed in the latest kid's fashions and accessories. Lizzie comes with a translation booklet and a unique password to a website where children can play language games. The doll takes three AAA batteries.Lizzie is a wonderful and educational gift for children age 3 and up. I have given Lizzie to a cousin's daughter and Ricky, her Spanish speaking male counterpart, to a friend's son. They were saying ""uno, dos, tres"" and ""Hola! Como esta usted?"" in no time! Highly recommended.JANA"
5,Beautifuly written.A real testimony of faith and trust.,"I am relatively new to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints[Mormons]. I knew some of the ""Principle of Plural Marriage."" This book helped to put the human aspect to it,to make it real.I felt almost every emotion possible as I read it. When I finished I was drained,relieved and yet disappointed it had ended.If anything this story has only strengthened my testimony of the truths of the Mormon Faith and that Josph Smith was a true Prophet of God."
3,Different Band,"The last two albums were brutal extreme death grind. This isn't the same band. They practically become more technical with this release. Not like it's a bad thing, but if your last album (""Only Tools and Corpses"") was a chaotic deathgrind mess that blew you away during the first listen, you'll be disappointed. Whatever. I guess that if you're not much into brutality and more into melody, you'll like this."
2,Could have done better,"Mutilated in minutes and Only tools and corpses are both amazing cds,but this one i didnt really think that highly of.I think its cause the songs arent as catchy,but still from a personal level i dont think its that good.I mainly gave it two stars cause the only song i think thats good is ""selection and dissection of parts for ressurection"". So yeah,i dont really reccomend this cd"
5,Great Stuff,"My friend just bought the CD and pressed me to check it out. Well, I actually like that I can check out every song before buying, so I know exactly what I'm getting. I love Alicia's voice, and the music production, and the feeling I get when listening. This is great!"
3,It's ok,"I returned it, but only because it didn't look great on me bathe quality it good and does give good coverage though"
2,Greasy and Smelly,"This product is greasy, and it has a powdery smell - like cheap creams. Well, what can you expect since it is a cheaper product....I won't buy again for sure!"
2,Not A Good Vehicle For Krishnamurti's Teachings,"This collection of a bunch of very short commentaries misses its mark. The commentaries open up with Krishnamurti laying down a setting and/or background of the people concerned with the topics presented. Then, they just crumble away into short, mostly ambiguous, commentaries. If you aren't familiar with Krishnamurti's terminology & philosophy, these commentaries can be very confusing. If you are familiar with him, you'd probably agree that they flat-out aren't very good for the most part. I did brighten in finding some of his ideas expressed quickly & to the point, in ways not spoken in other works. But, for the most part, I thought the majority missed their mark."
1,Where's the BEEF!???,"Ya know... when you get roped into buying Amazon Prime and told you get all sorts of free movies, you kind of want to believe them. SO, being gullible as I am, I saw ""A Team"" as being a freebie when I did my search. ... Am I the only one that thinks a 6 minute preview is lame for a 'free movie' offering?"
1,bullcrap,Why does amazon continue to trick us with these short and junk stuff. You click this thinking it is the movie and its not. At least Netflix has the actual movies they advertise. Come on Amazon
1,very disappointed,When I put it in my DVD player it says bad disk. It won't play in either of my DVD players.
4,A Team of well cast actors,"I rented this movie with Amazon On-Demand, and it was enjoyable. Not the kind of movie that I have to own, but it stayed true to what the Series was, and yet it added something different. I wish all remakes of tv could be this faithful. It was close enough with different actors, that it did not make me want to hate it, and yet it was jazzed up enough to make it more better."
2,Confusing story line,"Lots of action but not up to the standards of the television show which had some class. Sorry, cant recommend it."
4,Nice,Good movie. Worth watching a few times. Only scene that was a lil messed up was with the tank but other then that over all very nice.
5,Never watched the show...,"Okay I never watched the show before, and the only thing I knew about it was Mr. T.But a date brought me to see it and I LOVE IT!I had some decent effect, the actors are amazing and Murdoc (hopefully thats how you spell his name) was hilarious.Its a action comdey which I love, and plan on getting a copy of the movie."
4,Better Than Expected!,I didn't see this movie in the theaters but glad to see it on Amazon.com on demand! Action packed movie and better than expected!!!
4,A-Team players,"Usually something like this turns out cheezy, but not this time. I liked all the actors. They made it exciting and fun. I give them an A on this one."
5,A-Team Blueray,Loved the A-Team as a kid and the movie did not dissappoint. Lots of action and good old fashion movie magic. For a film that has alot of action you had to really saty with the plot to keep up on what was happening.Hope they make a sequel to this.
5,this book is so good my dad even read it!,I love this book it was the frist chapter book I ever read by my self!Now I have the hole seires! Thats why I give this book 5 stars!
3,Pleasant Piffle,"For those of you looking for ""the breakout"" role for any of the actors involved in this film, you will be dissappointed. Liam Neeson and Viggo Mortensen do try to make the most of the material they are given. The movie starts like a ""Lifetime network"" advertisement as yet another gullible woman finds out that the love of her life has staged his own death and set up a crazy trail of bank accounts all over the world revealed by her knowledge of his gambling habits and a series of baseball cards she finds. When she quite literally follows an ink trail to Cairo, the movie does finally take on a little more dimension, and we finally get to see Viggo in something other than flashbacks, but by then its just about over. I'd say this is a good popcorn flick for a lazy Saturday afternoon."
1,Unsatisfied,We bought the gel inserts and my husband only was wearing one and now it looks like a pancake. There is no more gel inside of it.
2,dissapointed actor,"This book was not exactly what I was hoping it would be. I am an actor whose faith plays a large role in how I approach things (especially art) and the decisions I make. The spirituality discussed in this book seems watered down and manipulated to suit the individual's needs. Most of the people interviewed talk about their faith as if its only purpose is to make them feel warm and tingly instead of how their faith shapes their relationship with a living God and the people around them that most religions tell us we are called to serve and love. This book has a few interesting moments, but I wish it would have dug a little deeper."
4,Entertaining show!,"I don't think I would purchase again, but I think it's a good show- just not great. The first season was real good, second and third were just okay. True to form western."
5,The real west,"If you have seen the HBO series you will want to own this, it stays in your blood. Not for viewing by children or teenagers at all. Very strong language and situations. Realistic and brutal at times, but in all cases it follows closely the real events of the founding of Deadwood."
4,Good resource for interpeters,"This book is a great resource for ASL interpreters. It shows the signs for sex and sex related vocabulary in a tactful way.The book also shows some varations of signs that are found in different parts of the country,showing if it is a sign that men and woman both use or not. I found this book helpful in learning sex related vocabulary and encourage it to people who are studying to be interpreters or interpreters who are not yet fluent with this kind of vocabulary."
5,Surgical Tape,This is agreat price for the tape. It is the exact same tape as listed on there site. There also shipped it very promply.
3,Average At Best,"The big return effort of Rob coming back to Judas Priest. Honestly, I wish he would have stayed away. Rob's solo band Halford was A LOT better. For those that haven't heard them check out Halford's ""Live Insurrection"". It's got to be one of the all time greatest live performances.Angel of Retribution is alright, but it isn't quite as heavy as Halford and the vocals aren't as good. I bought it just for the DVD part of the disc which I was hoping the live stuff would come close to the quality of ""Live Insurrection"", but it wasn't. I was looking for the goose bumps you get when you see something powerful. For example, Doro's DVD ""Fur Immer"" which has the entire Cave concert. That was a powerful performance.Overall, this effort is a listen to once and it will collect dust on the shelf.... but ""Live Insurrection"" will continue to get my attention."
4,Priest is back with avengance!!!!!,A phenominal new album since Pain killer!!We have been waiting nearly 15 yearsfor a new full length album by themetal gods!!!A must own for every fan!!!!
1,Dual Disc?? Dont Do it!,"Just got the new CD/DVD this new thing called a ""Dual Disc"".Dont buy it, read the back of the box....""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the AUDIO side of this disc"". Nice!so there is no way to even make a rip then re-burn this to play in my 2 year old car with all the anti-piracy crap on the disc.How is the CD? never listened to it, thanks JP and Epic for taking my hard earned money!"
2,Some Eyes Are Gonna Roll,"Take every Priest lyric written between 1980 and 1990, combine them all together no matter if they make sense or not, and you have this album.Though for some, that may be a good thing."
2,2.5 stars- This is a pretty forgettable Priest effort,"Priest sounds very much like they're trying to sound like Priest, but none of these tracks stick in your mind after you've listened to ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION. A lot of people have said that they like the track Lochness the least, but to tell you the truth, that's the one that I like best, and I can't really stand the track ""Judas Rising"". Many reviewers have said that's their favorite track, but it's just a stupid sounding song. If Priest is just going to put out stuff like this again and again, I think I'm going to stop listening to their stuff, and stick with groups like Iced Earth."
3,decent,"priest returns with a decent effort. My favorite is the opening track ""judas rising"" while my least favorite is ""lochness"" most of this album is forgettable, but considering their age it's not so bad."
5,Amazing. Easily the best since Screaming for V (1982!!!),"One of the best metal albums of all time based on consistency, musicianship and sound. I recognize JP as the best heavy metal band of all time, though I DO NOT buy everything they put out (i.e. Turbo through Ripper's stuff, though Painkiller had 2 or 3 great tracks). When I listen to all the old Priest classics, which are real classic albums, I tend to skip a song or two, especially some of the ballads. No skipping on this my friend and not just because it is new. Halford sounds amazing, even on the stripped down vocal parts - Amazing like 25 years ago. Glen and KK play some of their best leads ever, and Scott Travis (aka Big Man) - is he not one of the best rock drummers ever?"
4,Classic Metal? You bet your a**!,"These guys have done an incredible job in this record! The energy is all over the place, strong songs, and Rob Halford's voice drives you nuts as always. His vocals are all over the place, even at his age, he does things that most singers in their 20's can only dream of.The DVD is also very nice, the interviews and the concert clips are very enjoyable. They only thing I don't like is that some of the songs got cut off between the interviews.Like good wine, it gets better with age...these guys have created a classic!"
5,judas is back!,"this is one of the best judas priest cd's.i have not tried the dvd side of the disk yet,but this is deffinatly an awesome cd.dont think about buying this cd...just do it and you wont regret it.p.s judas is rising!!!(best and heavyist song on cd)"
4,I thought Metal was dead..,"I've never been a devoted Judas Priest fan. I bought ""Angel of Retribution"" just because I was curious as to what this bunch of 50-yr-olds would sound like in this day and age.And I have to say that ""Angel of Retribution"" offers some amazing heavy metal material to satisfy any Heavy Metal fan out there. I've been playing the CD nonstop since I got it and it really gets better with every spin.There is heavy stuff like `Judas Rising', `Demonizer' and the amazing `Hellrider'. There is some good' ole classic metal like `Deal w/ the Devil' and `Wheels on Fire'. Experimental metal like `Revolution', `Worth Fighting For' and a beautiful ballad called `Angel'. And then the CD ends with a classic metal 13-minute operatic (either you'll like it or you don't) song called `Loch ness'.Some may not like this CD but consider this, for ANY band that has survived 30+ years and still sound this fresh, powerful and energetic, ""Angel of Retribution"" deserves a buy."
4,Pretty Good Album.,"Ok, I am writing from Bangalore in India, bought the CD for400/- Rs Only. Which is about 9 and odd dollars. I did notget the DVD with this purchase. I think the album does prettywell though not spectacular.The best tracks in priority order are :1. Hell Rider2. Judas is Rising3. Angel4. Deal with the devil.They are old- Judas Priest, the band members are over 55I think. Robert Halford sounds good but not as good as before.Regards, Lakshman."
5,original metal gods have returned,"If you like halford and the rest of the priest is a definate buy, cd is like the pre-ram it down cd. great music to listen to all day, i have listened to it 4 times already since got it in and also made me wanna pull out my old priest cd's to listen to. rob halford and priest are the metal gods."
5,Rob is back!,"this is a great comeback cd, by the priest them selves with halford back at frontman duties for the first time since '93. This cd is great. has slower songs like angel and worth fighting for, and harder songs like demonizer and hellrider etc. The worst song on this cd, in my opinion, is probably lochness, because it is so different, however it, and eulogy, it's intro, are both good songs. If you heard revolution, and didn't like it, don't be alarmed, it is one of the worst one the album, but it will grow on you, like it has on me. This is a great cd! not one of priest's best, and it could have been better, but it is still amazing. you should deffinately buy this cd!"
4,rock gods are back,"this just basically kicks some major azz.not many bands can make a come back, record a new cd with new material with quality and something to say...just look at kiss. these guys are tight and they know how to write songs. there were only one or two weak songs...the lock ness song could have been shorter too but the overall felling is strong. rob h. still has the voice...there is no way motley crue or other comeback bands will be able to surpass this quality. they were great live too!!! they are true rock gods!!!"
5,damn good album,this is the only judas priest album i have but im familiar with their older stuff and i have to say that this is right up their with any other priest release. my favorite song on this album has to be hellrider. the backing vocals are really friggin cool and rob really brings that song to life. lots of cool riffs and real nice solo towards the end. definitely a good buy.
5,Entertainment never stops,Rock n roll at its finest...This band has been an all time favorite for many years...This album by far is a masterpiece done by these artists.
2,Maybe they should have chosen another producer....,"Maybe they should have chosen another producer..., maybe Andy Sneap, I don't know... The way it is, with Roy Z producing, the album seems more like a Halford solo project.There is absolutely nothing amazing about this album. It's not the masterpiece that hungry fans keep talking about. Anyway, it's a strong album, considering the extreme quality of everyone involved here. But it is one of the CD's that, without noticing, you will find that more and more time will pass before you listen to it again..."
2,priest's comback,"better than the ripper albums, but nothing special, for a great priest album buy 'stained class.'"
5,Excellent Starting Point For Those Inerested In Masonry,"I loved this book! It covers all the branches of Masonry and is written in a simple-to-understand style. If you're interested in becoming a Freemason, this is an excellent read!"
5,Great Masonry Book!,"This is a well written book for the rookie Mason or those who are just plain curious about Masonry. It dispels the many myths associated with Masonry and explains the history behind Masonry as well as why they do what they do. It also goes into the other parts of Masonry such as Shrine, Scottish Rite, York Rite and other bodies of Masonry as well as many other aspects of this fraternity such as the fears of different religious bodies. All in all this is a very well written and informative book."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book about Freemasonry. The author really knows his stuff and explains every detail of the brotherhood history, philosophy and rituals with a very light and, sometimes, funny language."
2,Reader beware,"Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO. The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO. Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized."
1,Don't waste your money on the digital upgrade!,"I made the mistake of purchasing the digital ""upgrade"" when I purchased the book and I regret it! The ""read now"" option is the same as the ""look inside"" option, just as slow to navigate and takes way too much ""website digging"" to gain access to the book. I thought it would be a benifit to have the online access to the book as well as the physical copy, but I was wrong. It would have been much more ""user friendly"" if it would have had a page of contents with the different sections of the book in hyperlink where you could at least get to a chapter in the book much quicker. As it is designed now, you have to read the table of contents page by page and remember what page the chapter you want to read is on. Then you must enter the desired page number and wait for the page to load. Good luck trying to get to the next page after that especially with a dial up connection! Too slow and cumbersome to enjoy."
5,Wonderfully interesting and engaging for laypeople,"As a bright artistic type who is basically scientifically illiterate, I often find myself unable to get through more than a third of my organic chemist husband's science books. Why We Get Sick is written for both the scientist and those who are just plain interested in knowing about things, i.e. people like me. Like all theories, what is presented here could be flawed. However the authors present a very intriguing point of view about health and the human body. Well worth tripping over a few unfamiliar words."
5,THE PERFECT GOLF READ,"The Little Red Book is the typical book you see on your buddies desk or sitting on a coffee table and cannot put it down. With so many cheap copies available on Amazon, this book should be a fixture for any golfer, regardless of age or gender. A must read and a great buy. You will not regret it."
1,abyssmal nonesense on par with Dianetics,"This book is a piece of trash. I feel that nothing other than such a blunt remark justifies my feelings towards this mish-mash of bogey, high-faultin' pretention and early 70s self-help gibberish. Clearly, this tripe hooked on to the swinging trend of cascading times when mid-life crisis was hitting people from 16 to 76. It will take the reader about an hour to puff through the briefness on nothingness with such inspired pages like ""Johnathan Livingston Seagull flies!"" on a page with a picture of the bird soaring off high into the sky. Real deep. The basic, Scientology inspired motivation is keen wrapped around something passed off by its publisher as literature about you and me and us and them when, in reality, it is about Richard Bach's own trifling human insecurities and his pompous belief that if he feels it, we all do. Surely most authors have such pretentions, but most are able to wrap a story around it so we can ignore it all the way through."
2,nothing special i think,"Not much to say, its simlpe and kinda plain, whatever you can learn from here, you can learn it better maybe by watching a tv series. I personally dont like too corny motivational stories, specially that are so simplisitic, but hey thats just my opinion, many like it, its got a message, it can be fun for you to imagine the same bird flying and flying and flying, and you might just really enjoy it."
5,Definitely a classic,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a simple, yet profound little book suitable for all age groups. It's a story about living life with great expectations, boundless dreams, and belief in oneself. It teaches the key lessons we all need to learn and practice in our daily lives. It's psychological, spiritual, inspirational, and emotional; above all it's the Truth. Jonathan and his family of seagulls teach the reader follow their dreams, escape the ordinary, and transcend the limits of the ego. Spread your wings and join the Flock in their fast paced spiritual adventure to the pinnacle of success; success which is defined by one's inner self rather than the society that surrounds us."
3,A simple and easy going story for relaxing reading.,"Seagulls are one of the most ""cursed at"" of birds. Yet Bach has transposed this sea scavenger into a friend telling you a story about his simple life. I can understand why some have found this book inspirational, but I put it more in the category of Watership Down or even Charlotte's Web.Jonathan Livingston Seagull will make it's progression down the age brackets and be interpreted differently by each succeedingly younger group of readers. Perhaps one day childrem will read it and other books like it and grow up to make the world better and more easy going."
4,Jonathon Livingston Seagull,"The book Jonathon Livingston Seagull is an excellent book. Hands down. This book gives you wings not only to fly with but to free your own mind from the illusions of everyday life. The book focuses on Jonathon Livingston Seagull (big surprise) and his desire to learn to fly. Of course, this is strictly tabooed by the Flock, or other birds. His desire to fly and to learn to fly are symbolic of the love of learning. Flying isn't just another natural instinct but rather an art. Such an art also is language and this book is a Mona Lisa then."
1,"The most boring, irrelevant, pointless book I have ever read","I do not understand how anyone could see anything valuable in this book. It is filled with inane, predictable cliches. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions over the course of the book... Not because the author wrote something witty or clever - but because the book continued to reach new levels of stupidity. I would be worried if a book about a seagull who learned to ""fly real good"" despite peer-pressure ended up changing my life."
1,Nice pictures,"Ok, get this, like the seagull is the revolutionary who gets killed and then comes back to life to teach us all, like man the seagull is Jesus but he's also Buddha, you dig?And to pad out this lame storyline, Bach gives us a bunch of grainy pictures of birds. Too bad he doesn't have the guts to show us birds pooping on a statue, having found TRUE enlightenment."
4,Good read,"A nice pick-me-up, but not as fun to read as ""Illusions."" Though it is short, it slows a little toward the middle, and not as distinguishable from other books of a similar theme. Worth looking at, but for inspirational reading by Bach, I'd go for ""Illusions."""
1,POP PSYCH 101,"I read this in 8th grade for a book report, because it was the shortest book on the list. I got an A on the report, but the book gets an F. This book deserves some of the blame for the introduction of feel good psych books which are trashing the minds of society. If you don't believe me, read some of the reviews with 5 stars beside them....sigh"
1,Don't read it,"Says all that is obvious, a guide book for idiots. Renews nothing. A total waste of time (not much but still a waste)."
3,"Good book...but not a ""must read""","This book, my manager recommended me to read and he did not even told me the content and moral of the story. He just told me that its a one of the bestselling book in the world. When i started to read, first i found it interesting, but after 2nd chapter I started loosing my interest in the story. I really have no clue why it happened. May be my expctations were bit high, may be my perspective is little different. I would not say that this is the book one must buy and keep it for the lifetime. There are number of books available which convey similar message in a very good way."
1,Excellent Book,"Of course, the book is excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to rate it 5 stars. However, it is not available for Kindle in Africa, and therefore the 1 star rating is directed at Amazon."
4,When I was younger,"I read this book when I was young (a LONG time ago) and it made a big impression on me. Then I was looking at the reviews of it and I decided to read it again. Do you ever get that feeling?Anyway, you can read in in less than 100 minutes (I timed it) and so I can now report that it is a good book but not as good as I remember. I found it kinda predictable, and it's not because I read it before.My conclusion: four stars is pretty good, but it will probably make a better impression on someone young than on someone older."
2,Why the Fuss?,"What a peculiar little book. I first recall reading it in the seventies and it made very little impact on me. So, some almost forty years later I decided to make a second attempt.It only takes an hour or so to read ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"". It's a tiny book. It's not even a very long short story. It is, however, allegorical. In simple terms, JLS is Jesus. He has learnt much from his heavenly father and is keen to pass the knowledge on to others. He can even perform miracles.Although this book has been widely praised and sold millions of copies, I had real difficulty in seeing why. It's not that it's well written or even very original. In fact, more than anything, it's just banal. What on earth is all the fuss about?By all means, go ahead and read this book. You won't be wasting much of your life. However, never let anyone tell you it is a great book or that it changed their life. Get real! It's an over-rated very short story whose fame precedes it."
4,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"Book Review: Jonathan Livingston SeagullI loved the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach. It is a great book that reflects upon the ability of an individual to perfect themselves: ""Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn't have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there"" (p 65). In this book a seagull named Jonathan Livingston spends his existence perfecting his flight he especially works on achieving high speeds. I believe this book is well written and very uplifting."
2,The Hobo Philosopher,"Well ... yeah ... but what? The author of this book was a pilot, a photographer and a school teacher at a prestigious school. One sees all of these attributes without much disguise. This is no ""Animal Farm."" It is not ""deep."" I am not much of a perfectionist myself, but I have always been attracted to adventure. Trying to put human attributes of adventure and perfection and ""flying above and away from the crowd"" onto a seagull could have been a believable possibility but it would have required a good deal more work and a much longer seagull history.It could be considered a poem in prose - sorta - but again it would have taken more work and it would have required the author to hire a poet. I hope the author made a lot of money from this work but I have no idea why that should have happened.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""A Little Something: Poetry and Prose"
5,The Art of Flying High,"A fun little book, it's very short and you can probably read it in one toilet sitting. Jonathon Livingston Seagull is an allegorical tale about a seagull who becomes completely absorbed in the art of flying, he learns everything there is to know about it, and through the help of two birds he flies to a `higher plane of existence'. There he meets a guru bird called Chiang who changes his perspective on life and helps him transcend time and space. Don't worry, I didn't ruin the book for you as it's not something you can ruin; it `transcends' story and plot. It is a story about the depths of human (or seagull?) potential and is very worth the read. Hmm, `very worth the read' doesn't sound quite right, oh well. Read this book!"
2,Didn't work for me...,"This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead..."
1,stab out your eyes,"Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and a friend of David, who would usurp his father's throne.I doubt Dick Bach probed that deep. I've had more insight from ""Bazooka Joe"" comics and gnawing the pink edible Lego brick inside.This is a `Tijuana Bible' of spirituality, and immediately reminds me of the line in Tony Hendra's `Deteriorata' ""Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls Would scarcely get your feet wet."" Fans of this book invariably live up to that.Okay, if folks are looking for spiritual enlightenment, may I suggest tackling something a bit deeper than a `metaphorical' tale of a winged crap machine? St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine's `Confessions?' Even ""From Reading Gaol"" tops this gobswallow.Please, for the respect of your own soul, try just a bit harder than this."
1,I am just hoping to bring the average down...,"Other negative reviews have already told the truth about this psycho-spiritual babble book. I'm mainly writing a review to try to help lower the book's average review rating.The only good thing you can say about this book is that it is short, so it doesn't waste as much time as it might. Of course, for some ""time"" is a meaningless concept - ""Being wasted is sooner that wasting time"" as it were. Take my word for it - getting wasted is no more a waste of your time than reading this book.And if getting wasted leaves you with a hangover, you might learn something; an experience that reading this book is unlikely to give you..."
3,Item Ok....not as descibed,Item was usable but I did not expect the item to be as beat up as it was.
5,Easily one of the most inspirational books ever written.,This book packs into a few short pages a plethora of universal truths. It is a simply written tale of the nature of purpose and of perfection. Its a story of freedom and thought and immortality that ought to inspire even the most stubborn pessimists and nay-sayers.
4,The best book on this topic,I really have to say that this is the best book I've read on ADSI and CDO. The way the authors combine the two technologies to accomplish what needs to be done makes you stop and think. This is a really good book on programming ADSI and/or CDO.
3,Frigates and India,"Interesting story with too much detail about British frigates, ships and officer rankings.The descriptions of India were very visual and full of opulence. Characters were mentioned and then dropped making the storyline hard to follow at times. However thread of the basic romance between a British commander and a beautiful Persian woman prevailed even to a disappointing and rushed ending."
4,The Best Book in English about Mexico and Mexicans.,"The Rocky Point (Puerto Penasco) Times calls this the best book in English about Mexico. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was some of the history. It needs someone to do an update of Fox's Presidency and Commandante Marcos.Growing up in New York, it was just a facsination. I now live in Tucson, Arizona. The border is an hour away. Distant Neighbors is an apt description. American and Mexicans talk past each other without really hearing each other. His best chapters? The beginning chapters about how the Mexican nation was born and the later chapters about the different regions of this diverse country. Distant Neighbors is my guide to start exploring beyond Nogales."
5,DISTANT NEIGHBORS,"excellent book for anybody who wants to know a little better the mexican culture and their problematic ways of life. This is a book with a prespective from somebody who is not mexican, awesome analysis."
5,take that radio shack,got this so i could plug in my panasonic mini dv camcorder to the television. i am assuming it will work with anything that requires a 3.5mm plug. works like a charms and was considerably less than radio shack.
3,Didn't work for me,The good news is that I received the Steren 6 Feet 3.5 mm to 3 RCA AV Camcorder Video Cable Sony JVC 6 quickly and that it looked like a well made product. I bought it specifically to work with an Audiovox DS9521PK portable DVD player but it didn't work. By connecting the red to the Yellow on the TV I was able to get some semblance of a picture on the TV but that was it. I had 2 other of these types of cables (one from a JVC camcorder and from a different Audiovox portable DVD player) and I could get no picture on the TV with either of them so I guess I can't be too disappointed with this cable. I ended up ordering the cable I needed directly from Audiovox and it worked perfectly. I didn't send this one back as it would cost more to send it back than it cost me to begin with.
1,Don't buy this.,I grew up making 'spritz' cookies and have been looking for my own cookie gun. I read different reviews and compared prices and settled on this one. I tried making cookies with it and it would NOT form the cookies. You have to use 2 hands to move the handle up and down because it is not a squeeze handle. You have to twist the plunger part to the side to pull it up and then re-twist it back into place. And there is a disc to slide the cookie size from 1 to 2 depending on what size cookie you want. The disc is impossible to move. It's a very frustrating machine and did not work for me at all.
2,The center cannot hold,"... because there IS no center. The plot wanders, the characters talk too much about nothing important, and they all seem dead from the neck in both directions. Very disappoinging."
2,don't bother,"Krentz created the characters on paper and then did not bother to breath bring some life and character into them. She used to be one of my top 10 authors that were a must buy, now don't waste your money. It's like someone else is writing her books for her, where's her editor and publisher? You don't even like the characters they are like paper dolls, no depth at all. i am was very disappointed in her last 3 books. She used to write real hot romance, a class act."
3,Standard Fair(port) Offering,"This release has been described by some as being ""electric renaissance music"". It is highly reminiscent of the early Renaissance period but only slightly turned up a knotch. I cannot call this offering ""electric"" because typically this would bring to mind the use of more modern-era instrumentation such as keyboards, synthesizers, rockier guitar elements, etc. Neither mellotron or moog can be be found here. For the most part traditional, (albeit amplified/mixed) wind instrumentation is used with the exception of periodic electric guitar/bass and drums and the electric guitar is far from adventurous. Much like Thompson-era Fairport Convention, nice listening but not overly exciting. For a harder, more muscular/electrified Renaissance sound, try Gryphon's ""Red Queen To Gryphon Three"" and ""Midnight Mushrumps""; middle-period Steeleye Span (""Below The Salt"" through ""Rocket Cottage""); or Annie Haslam era Renaissance (""Ashes Are Burning"" through "" Scheherazade & Other Stories"")."
2,Loose ends,"I have bought and shared all of Constance's books and I believe in metaphysical theories, but this book was wierd. I liked the addition of parallel worlds, but it was done in a way that didn't make any sense and at the end of the book there were loose ends that never got answered. I kept wishing I could re-write the plot. Needless to say, I won't be passing this book on to anybody."
3,"Good Story, Just Too Long","The premise is great- however, the book is just too long. Some things are simply redundant and needn't be repeated over and over. I started off loving Patsy,but as the book wore on I found myself getting mad at her- just leave Jim already! it would have been a 5 star book if it had just been a little shorter"
3,another English learning ref.,"My opinion, this one is not as good as ""Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 3rd"". However, having two dictionary at the same time can help you to understand more."
4,cool can,"I got this can for my bathroom. I have a dog that gets into the waste basket so this keeps him out well (it scares him). I tried cans that step on and manually lift but I have limited space, so the step one hit the wall and the lift one grossed me out with everyone touching it. This is a little big for the space but works the best of all of them. The down side of an covered can in the bathroom is that it holds in smells so when you open it ...icky sometimes, but that just means we need to change the bag, so that's ok. Sometimes these cans open when you are near but don't need them, which is sort of entertaining.... you can say ""hi"" or yell at it depending on your mood! I have one for the kitchen as well, gotten at costco and cheaper than this. But it was too big for the bathroom. So far I have not had to change the batteries on either can (had them for a couple months)."
5,Knowledge is Power,"This is the first book that I've read which establishes the relationship between emotions, power, and conflict. The book is easy to read and understand, and there are many thought-provoking examples and a self-inventory at the end of each chapter, and I found these to be quite helpful. If a person wants to understand conflict, he/she must first understand his/her sense of power and the emotions that we feel motivated by. This book explains these things very well, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,Slow and plodding... Not his best...,"I have never gotten into the Fearless Jones stories. It has always hit me as a ""watered-down-Kool Aid"" version of Easy Rawlins. This one was one or two clicks better than the first Fearless Jones novel but not much. This was little more than a fire drill in a chicken pen... a lot squawking and flapping and running in circles but not much getting done.If you wish to do a true contrast/comparison read ""Little Scarlet"". The setting of both books is the same historical period where Paris Minton even makes a cameo appearance... it is obvious what I am talking about."
3,Sizing may be inaccurate,I like the styling but the sizing seemed off. I ordered a wide and it seemed narrower than other Bostonians I own.
1,This CD is BAD,The only Reason this CD is heard around the world is because its jammed down our throughts...everywhere you turn its nelly....and why is that...because of the fans...NO because of Record companies saying...who should be the next big thing....Hmmmmmm how about nelly...they hype him up and then...BAMMMMMM Nelly sells soooooooo many CD's....why??? Because of all the dumb people on this earth....they only like what is Fed to them...they dont know good music when they hear it.....they only hear what they think is good music cuz Record companies tell the people what to listen 2.....So this CD is less than 1 Star..but it wouldnt let me do that...
1,Crap,"Nelly shows just how pathetic mainstream hiphop has become in this sorry cd. With lyrics like ""It's getting hot in here so take off all your clothes"", you learn quickly that his ability to use language creatively is about as lacking as his ability to inspire anyone to do anything but smoke weed, self-indulge and treat women like objects. Nelly is about as hot as Pluto and as tight as the grand canyon. Besides his utter lack of musical talent, what the hell is wrong with his damn face? Take off those stupid bandaids! It loods stupid, or like someone slapped him across the face, which he most likely deserved for putting out such a bad album to hopefully finish off a bad career."
3,Pretty good sophmore effort,"This cd was very similar to ""Country Grammer"". It's stand out track is ""On the Grind"". Even thought theres a lot of garbage floatin around how Nelly is now a ""Pop"" rap artist but thats just how it is. This album prooves hes a formitable lyricist. Who cares who he offends, if my album went 8X platinum i'd be flaunting the success just like him."
2,Not A Great CD,"Nellyville was a bad CD! I only liked one song, Hot In Herre. The rest is garbage. Country Grammar was DEFINETLEY a much better CD than Nellyville. What happened? Nelly will soon be a forgotten rapper if this is his best work. Move over Nelly, rappers like Ludacris and Ja Rule are definetley passing you by. I do not recommend Nellyville to anyone who appreciates rap."
3,OK........BUT CANT TOUCH COUNTRY GRAMMER,"I got to give it to Nelly, he had finally put St. Louis on the rap scene. I loved Country grammer, but this album is a step down. Some of the songs are just, ok. This album is not a total disapointment, but it lacking something. I would listen first before purchase."
2,Not Surprising...,"Nelly does not surprise me with his commercial style at all, but this CD has pushed far more than Country Grammar. ""Hot In Herre, Dilemma, Air Force ONe's"" are all Xtremely commercial songs...Air Force One's beat is tyght, otherwise the song is trash. Although the CD was downfall there were a couple good songs that werent promoted as much as the others(or not at all). for example: country grammar part2, rock da mic remix are both nice songs. The production on this cd is great, the beats are banging, its just the commercial lyrics that gets a BIG MINUS on the cd, #1 is also a BIG BIG MINUS since the disappointment was out way be4 the cd came out..."
1,why did i buy this? track 2 is un-safe.,"I wos in da house wit ma homies man, an dis ay dark man. wots angin wit tarck 2?????????????????????????????????????????it wos bad manwot a tool...i wonted toons in da inner area.is it cos i is black?"
2,Half Decent At Best,"This CD appears promising from the outset. Good background beats in most of the songs make you want to listen to it. However, Nelly has lost his 'new flavour' touch that he had on his first album. His lyrics are amazingly repetitive, and I must say upon closer inspection, even the beats sound quite similar. The only song worth listening to was ""Splurge"" because it demonstrated his talents as a rapper, singer and had a promsing guitar beat in the back that sounded very unique. All in all, I found the CD much too 'Mainstream' for someone who is a fan of quality rap music. It gets the attention of the popular music culture, and Nelly looks to be trying to remake his first cd for some easy money."
2,just doesn't impress me,"nelly's debut album "" country grammer"" sold well worldwide, but ""nellyville"" has some bad songs here, the production is average, the only songs that are worth listning to are "" air force ones"" and "" delima"" and "" # 1"" and the rest seemed like they were written in 5 min, dont get me wrong, when you compare this album to some rap classics like, nas's "" god's son"" and ""illmatic"" and jay'z new album "" the black album"" it just doesn't stand a chance, nelly is just another pop-rapper for the main steam."
2,The Worst!,Very Short Review:The Great: I didn't buy this album my friend let me burn a copy!The Good: Hott In Herre was a good track and there are a couple of other good songs.The Bad: This album has old songs that he done and he just fillers them on this album.The Ugly: This album sold well! And it's not even good! This album stinks compared to Country Grammar!The Super Ugly: This album's lyrics...........horrible!!! If you are looking for Real Rap....This is not it folks! If your look for a Pop star that is mostly in this for the money......then Nelly is your man!Peace Out Folks!!!
3,"what the----happened,man?","nelly was one of south's best with country grammar.we all pumped it in our stereos for bout two years constantly.he did tracks with lil wayne,the then-unheard-of st.lunatics,teamsters,and had straight jay e beats.now he does tracks with destiny's child,justin frickin timberlake,beanie sigel,and pop-raps over neptunes beats half the time.I give 3 stars to him,cause underneath his radio deal,he can rhyme(air force ones,splurge,nellyville,dem boyz,oh nelly,on the grind).but the dawg needs to get back to gangstaish rap.but if you don't have it already,get CG.peace out"
1,Laughable,"Whatever happened to rap and hip hop?We've gone from guys singing about how tough life in the ghetto is to this, some materialistic jacka$$ with a band-aid on his face mumbling, ""It's getting hot in here, so take all of your clothes off"". LOL, this ain't hip hop ladies, it's pure pop on completely the same level as bands like Nsync et al (as evidenced by Justin Timberlake appearing on this albumn).I guess to be fair you could call it conformist hip hop approved by ""the man"" and an insult to the artists who pioneered the genre like Public Enemy and Run DMC.Nelly and his albums represent all that is wrong with the music industry today and I truly feel sorry for any individual who would purchase this tripe..."
1,"Gee, what a surprise","Damnit people, haven't you figured it out yet? Nelly is like the LOWEST form of music. I mean jesus, any real artist could have written those lyrics at age 5 if they knew the cuss words. ""Hey look at me, I'm #1"" (only because the american people have no idea of what real music is). If you like hip-hop or rap check out some more honest stuff by people who put just a LITTLE thought into it. If i were you, i would NOT buy the album. Oh, and by the way, i didn't buy it either, i heard it at a friend's house."
1,"TOO LATE, HE KNOWS HE'S A SEX SYMBOL","I WAS DISSAPOINTED WHEN I HEARD THIS CD, THE SONG ""HOT IN HERRE"" HIT IT, THAT TRIGGERED MY MIND INTO BUYING THIS CD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE ""COUNTRY GRAMMAR"" CATCHY BEATS, TIGHT SONGS. BUT...OF COURSE, IT [STINKS]! WHEN I HEARD HIS SECOND SINGLE ""DILEMMA"" I WAS THINKING ""ARE ALL RAPPERS TURNING SOFT? NO REALLY, FABOLOUS TURNS SOFT, JA RULE TURNS SOFT, AND NOW NELLY? MY FRIENDS/PEERS ARE RIGHT. THIS ALBUM IS MORE AIMED TOWARDS GIRLS, HIS LAST CD WAS FOCUSED ON BOTH SEXES, BUT THEN HE TURNED INTO A BIG SEX SYMBOL AND HE KNOWS IF HE AIMED THIS ALBUM TOWARDS WOMEN, HE'LL SELL MORE. BY THE WAY, THE BEST SONGS ARE ""#1"" AND ""AIR FORCE ONES"" AND ""HOT IN HERRE"" THATS IT! SORRY NELLY"
5,"GREAT album, best song- Work It","this whole cd is excellent, features nelly's superior mc styles and perfectly compliments his first cd. the best song on the album features the most talented nsyncer- justin timberlake, work it! its crazy and great!!"
1,danger to hip hop,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD. WE NEED TO PUT A STOP TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC. THE THING THAT KILLS ME IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS ALBUM. WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE A DUMB SONG ABOUT SHOES.WE NEED TO STOP SUPPORTING THIS KIND OF COMMERCIAL MUSIC.
3,Hated the taste,"I tried the toothpaste BEFORE trying to get the toothbrush in his mouth. He sniffed and turned away. The toothpaste MUST be tasty if you don't want your dog to hate having his teeth brushed. The brush is a good size for a pup or small dog, but feels a bit too stiff. Because of this, I cannot recommend this kit."
2,Reads like a tabloid,"Kitty Kelley would make a great gossip columnist, but as a biographer or historian she is absolutely awful.She seems unaware that when King George IV and his wife Elizabeth visited North America World War II had not yet started. She also seems confused about when Churchill became Prime Minister. If she fails with these basic facts that can be found in any history book, how reliable can the rest of her information be?"
1,The worst book I ever read all the way to the end,Miss Kelley's style goes down easily enough. But she mistakes chatting with ill-informed bystanders for research. You don't have to know much about the British royal family to realise that Kelley knows next-to-nothing. The greatest offence is that the book is presented as a piece of serious scholarship. Awful.
4,Why are the British people not allowed to read this book?,"I tried to purchase this book through Amazon, but I was told that it could not be shipped to UK addresses. This is apparently due to an official ban imposed by the British Government. By chance, I then found a copy when browsing in a local 'bargain' bookshop; the book cannot be obtained from large bookstore chains in the UK such as Waterstones etc. I found it to be reasonably well researched, and far more intelligently written than articles one might read about 'the royals' in the British tabloids. Ms Kelley rightly indicates throughout her book the huge amounts of money that the various post- war debacles of the Mountbatten- Windsor family have cost the British people. How ironic, then, that we are the only people in the world who are officially not allowed to read this book! What do the international community think about this? Opinions please!"
3,Good but.....,"As a huge Buddy Miles fan (from the Them Changes era) I was anxious to get this DVD! Well, Miles's drumming still holds up but, the vocals were dissapointing! Not from Buddy himself but the two other players. Mind you they're instrument playing was quite good but not there vocal technique! I was saddened to hear of Buddy's passing. The world lost a great talent and was up there as one of the best ""funk"" and ""rock"" drummers of our time! So buying this just to see Buddy's performance was worth it!"
2,Not very compelling,"I had heard that Ian Rankin's books featurning Det. Rebus were must reading for fans of this genre. Well, ""The Black Book"" certainly did not leave me with that impression. This book was a standard police procedural, that made very little sense. I am not even sure why the book was called ""The Black Book"". There was almost no action and so many minor characters that it was hard to tell who was who. The real problem for me was all the seemingly non related events that came together during the book were impossible for the reader to piece together, so the author throws all of this up in the air and only Det. Rebus can figure it out. Not sure yet if I will try another Det. Rebus story."
2,A Decent Rebus Book,"This is a perfectly good Inspector Rebus book. It is not Ian Rankin's best in the series, but it is not the worst."
5,lots of seeds,tons of seeds some you may like some you may notgood for learning and messing aroundi shoulda bought only the ones i liked but i didnt know which those were till after i tried them all :)
2,"Fine product, but listing is unclear","First and foremost, the product is fine. The glass looks like plastic (which it is) but is well-sized for a frozen drink and it serves its purpose. I have not washed it in the dishwasher, so I cannot speak to its ability to hold up (minus the heated drying cycle).Most importantly, if you linked to this item for the pack of 18 - let it be known that despite the description saying it is a ""set"" and the name saying ""glassES,"" plural, this is one singular glass that you will be purchasing. If you are looking for a set of multiple glasses, this is not the item for you."
5,A truly funny an innovative bond/mission impossible spoof,"I have been trying to get a copy of this movie for at least 15 years now and the fact that it is now coming out on DVD is why I love this format . The movie is a funny spoof of spy movies with amazing action and truly one of a kind gadgets . The series also has a famous villian in every installment , in this one it is the clint eastwood character from the good ,the bad ,the ugly (or at least a lookalike) . This movie is for kids and adults alike and especially for fans of spys and gadgets . I won't be buying it but only because I am buying the whole collection ."
4,A historical gem,"Who would have thought a 1933 recording could sound this good? The performance is first rate, and my only regret is that this is a ""highlights"" CD. I wish the entire performance were available."
3,Inland Knights - Creative Spaces,"As the tracks morphs from one to the other on the Inland Knight's CREATIVE SPACES, you almost don't notice the switch. It's a good thing, because they're seamless and have a pleasant, constant groove. It's a bad thing, too, because the individual tracks don't distinguish themselves much. But overall, it's OK -- this album was meant more for the dancefloor than for home listening. Each of the track follows a simple pattern: beats, melodies, vocal samples. And even if it doesn't vary much from that, it still gets your feet tapping. The burbling on ""Moody Magic,"" for instance, or the disco vibes on ""Got to Live"" and deep melodies of ""If Only"" keep things lively. It's the final, untitled track that brings things down to a blues-level groove. Overall, it's nice enough."
4,Smokin!,"I heard ""Fanta,"" which reminded me of Professor Longhair meeting a Guatemalan marimba player on battery acid, somewhere in Martinique (or Mali, for that matter), and I was compelled to listen to as much of the album as I could. I'm glad I did. Blues from Africa, so to speak, but with a great improvisational vibe that's decidedly African."
5,Jolly Good,"Hi! Several years ago I heard ""Confucious"" on the radio. When I finally found this CD I had to have it. The music is great. The rhythms and sounds are authentic steel drums played by musicians who love to play. It's energizing and uplifting. Fun for everyone from the babies to the grandparents. Put it in your party mix for the summer. Know someone who's a little ""down""? Send them Double Barrel by Jazz Jamaica. Jolly Good!"
5,Awesome goal,My 8 year old grandson & his friends are having a great time playing street hockeyHave purchased other hockey goal and this is awesome strong sturdy well built great priceI would recomend this product if you have boys that like to play street hockeyGreat price !!!
4,Decent net,"I went with steal because hitting the pipe in hockey produces my favorite sound. I just wish the pipes were a bit thicker, I believe they were an inch in diameter. Other than that, the net was decent quality and the assembly didnt take that long, less than 30 minutes. Only requires two screws to attach the pipes which old up the back (area where the bottles go)."
3,GOOD NET FOR THE PRICE,"We got this net for my son. It is the second one we have purchused so he can play hockey with friends in the driveway. The first one which he got last Christmas (so used 1 1/2 yrs almost everyday) is ripping at the bottom of the red fabic. Not sure if it is because he uses it everyday and drags it across the driveway.It also stays outside all the time. So even though the first one ripped (I used duct tape and fixed) we got a second one.They are a good size he can move by himself and a great price compared to others. I would recommend these especially if casual user. Easy to put together. For Heavy user like my son, I wish it had a little stronger net."
1,Horrifying!,this cd is a complete nightmare. don't buy it. get a newborn baby to scream in your ear for about 2 weeks straight instead.
4,"All your friends will ask ""who's this?""","I heard this CD during the intermission of a Keller Williams show and had to find out what it was. Keller's wife turned me on to him and it was a great buy. Being a (sort-of...terrible) didg player, I love what he's done using samples on this CD. Funky sounds are the underlying texture of this CD with ""dingo barks"" and ""kukaburras"" (spelling?) making you laugh as you drive your car too fast. As one reviewer mentioned, all jams stay in one key, but every didgeredoo is only in one key. Trust me, it won't hinder you're gettin' down to this one. EVERYONE who's been to my house while this was playing asks who it is. It's a very unique sound and well worth the small price. Hope this helped."
1,Not good,"I just heard a recording of the D major toccata on the radio that left me wondering, ""why are they playing a mediocre student recording?"" Well, let's just say I was amazed to discover that this pianist is considered a Bach specialist, and that he has recorded the complete keyboard works. Martins's playing is somehow both mannered and boring at the same time (at least Gould's is mannered and interesting)."
4,Not What You Expected,"I purchased this album in it's original vinyl format. I'm so sorry that it's now so hard to get on disk 'cause it really was one of their best efforts. Easy Groove is a great song , and easily one of Randy's best. Try to get your hands on a copy...it's worth it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased these sheets. I just assumed thread count meant quality and softness -- was I ever wrong! As so many others have pointed out, the sheets felt nice and soft when I opened the package, so I assumed they were fine. But after laundering, they were course, stiff, and unbelievably wrinkled. We are sleeping on them, but I am afraid after a second laundering they will have to be replaced! At least I now know not to order Pike Street bedding for the replacement, and to read the reviews before buying!"
2,not to soft and smooth,I was disappoint with this product. I thought the package will come with 2 pillow cases and 2 pillow shams. I was not as soft and smooth like 420 thread count.
2,A little rough,"For the price the sheets are fine, but they are a bit rough. After a few washes and a LOT of fabric softener they are sleep-able :-)"
1,terrible quality,These sheets are the worst quality of sheets I've ever purchased. I washed them twice before using them and they still feel like sandpaper. I would never purchase Pike Street sheets again and wouldn't recommend them to anyone else.
3,Birds eye view. Level of detail inconsistent.,"Good, if brief, summary of Balkan campaign. Reviews political, logistical, and force aspects of the campaigns, but left me wanting to know more of somethings but less of others. For example, he lists a detailed order of battle for the German forces arranged against Yugoslavia, but leaves you to find out on your own what the composition of a German Tank Corps would be, when a simple table would provide lots of clarity. For the Yugoslavia campaign, the bulk of the writing involves preparations, and the combat narrative is a bare skeleton. The Greek campaign is described in somewhat more detail and leaves the reader with a better understanding. The photos might be interesting if they were not too fuzzy to interpret. The maps are almost illegible and therefore unhelpful."
3,good for beginners,good variations to pre-pregnancy poses and would be best for someone who has none or little prior exposure to pilates.
5,:),"This is an all around good book to have, when needing a good cheering up, or when needing a popular story for little kids"
3,A Great Collection This is Not,"This book is not one of the best among those in the Dover Art Library. A handful (about a half-dozen) of pictures are good with sufficient details and/or a tight organization to be appreciated. Most are so-so. Some are definitely fillers. It does not help that Rubens himself, according to the Publisher's Note, did not think highly of his own drawings and did not even sign a single one of them. All told, this selection is not impressive.Rubens's paintings, rather than his drawings, should rightly be his legacy."
2,decent for getting a photo but leaves you wanting better,"it's fine for lots of situations but after using it for a few days i found myself wanting something with image stabilization. any shots above 55mm in low light were hard to get without some blur from camera shake. also, the focus ring on this thing feels pretty loose. overall i'm pretty happy with this lens. it's small and good for those times when you don't want a bulky, overbearing camera. in retrospect i wish i could have spent $400-$1000 on a really good lens."
3,My review,I heard her live in Chicago at Evette's about 3 years ago and thought she was great. I bought at least two of her CD's before and especially liked her Cole Porter renditions. I thought the Gershwin interpretations were a bit strained. Very shocked to hear of her recent suicide.
5,Soon To Be A Classic,"This is the most original album I have ever heard. This is not for everyone but I can tell you who it is for. First of all if you are a fan of Del, Hieroglyphics, or Souls of Mischief, this is a must buy. If you are into the so-called futuristic stlyes of artists such as the Neptunes(aka NERD), Eight Ball & MJG, Outkast, or the Goodie Mob, then you should atleast check this out because there are atleast a few songs on here you will enjoy. And finally if you are a fan of the bullsh*t being played on the major airwaves , then you should purchase this album just so you can hear what a real MC sounds like. O.K. never mind I guess this album is for everyone. "" I want to devise a virus, to bring dire traits to your enviroment """
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality, the button holes do not line up with the ones on the coat they make and I don't know what they insulated it with but it must be fiberglass like what you use to insulate your home, very itchy and uncomfortable. The thing is made in China so there ya go."
1,Childhood favorite!,Bought this book for my grandson. He is being raised bilingual. Favorite childhood book comes to live in french. Good find.
3,Nice Book,"I purchased this book for a French co-worker expecting her first grandchild. This would be a 5 star if it was the ""board-book"" version. This one is paper-back and therefore a little flimsy especially as a gift."
5,"Good old Sharon, Lois & Bram","I was so happy to find this CD for my 2 year old granddaughter. We play it in the car all the time and she LOVES it.Her mom used to watch the Elephant show when she was little, and it's wonderful to see how this timeless trio still makes little ones fill with joy.Great investment.I recommend this to all new parents, and grandparents. The music is easy to the ears, anda the songs are easy to sing along with."
2,a bit overhyped....,"Although the surfing and localism is quite incredible, the long pleas for trying to justify the Aussie ""thug life"" that these guys lived goes a bit overboard and actually bores the audience. A little further editing could have cut at least 30 min off this movie and had the same effect, without the boring narrations and interviews. Sometimes ignorance just can't be justified.Coverage of the ""murder in self defense"" is the most interesting part of the film. Worth a watch, but I would doubt that this is a film most could watch twice."
1,"If beeping annoys you, do not buy","For me, this would be an absolute do-not buy. I will say this about it: I only have one problem with it. It's easy to assemble, it works well, etc.But it beeps. Over, and over, and over, and over again. Every minute, on the minute, it beeps loudly at you. There's no way to turn it off. There's no way to disconnect it. You can't mute the sound, or lower the volume. I called customer service and they blew me off. It's loud enough that even with music turned on in my headphones, I keep hearing it. Every single time the timer passes another minute, it's going to make that loud beep at you. I have no clue why someone would decide to install a feature like this, or what possible purpose it could have, or why they would ever think a customer would want it. If you work out for forty minutes, you will be beeped at forty times. I bought this because I wanted to read while working out, and it's frankly too annoying for me to use it like that."
3,Schwinn 231 Recumbent Exercise Bike,"Someday, I may get to actually use this piece of exercise equipment! It took over three weeks to get here and then was missing parts. I was sent the missing parts but they were the wrong ones and one of them was broken.Now, I am waiting for the right parts and replacement for the broken parts. Amazon was quite willing to go to the manufacturer and get things moving at no extra cost to me, but now it has been over a month and we still do not have a working piece of equipment.Hope it all works when I finally get it put together!"
4,"Good product, but a few set backs","Very quiet operation and good ergonomics. Delivery was fast and assembly was about 1 1/2 hrs. The only problem was the fan did not work. I called manufacturer which sent me a replacement fan and still didn't work. I think the computer is flawed and now need to have it replaced.*update 2/5/09 Can't get a hold of Customer service from Schwinn, their 800# does not work and I faxed them to call me back, but they have not called me back. I am getting very upset with their service."
2,SO THE BIKE WORKED GREAT THE 1ST DAY......BUT,"3RD DAY USING THE BIKE THE BIKE STARTED MAKING A KNOCKING NOISE INSIDE THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY.....EVERY SPIN OF THE PEDAL IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE....ITS SATURDAY AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW.,..THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABE...HOW CONVIENIENT..SO I WILL HOPEFULLY AMEND THIS REVIEW IF THEY COME FIX THIS THING....AND BTW THE PACKAGING WAS HARDLY HOLDING ITSELF TOGETHER WHEN I GOT IT AND THERE WAS A CREASE IN THE SEAT FROM THE PACKAGING SQUISHING IT THAT HASNT GON AWAY...RIGHT NOW IM NOT HAPPY AT ALL"
5,Awesome,"I really can't say enough about how great this recumbent bike is. I was very unhappy with a ProForm Elliptical I purchased a while back. I had to return it twice and then got my money back. The Schwinn however, this is a dream machine. Completely silent, and gives me a great workout. I use this in the mornings before my infant son wakes up and I can ride knowing that the noise from the machine won't wake him up..."
5,Carol,"My Husband was so impressed with the quality of the bike and especially the manual directions and assembly that he called the company to give positive feedback, something he never does. As for myself, my arthritic knees are less stressed as I strive for aerobic fitness and my comfort level is great. Something I did not expect from a recumbent bike."
5,A snapshot of one woman's journey,"Frances Kuffel explains how she, personally, experienced obesity, the determination to change her life, and the process of making that change.She does not set herself out as a model for all to duplicate. Certainly, I would have liked to see her resolve more of her psychological issues before the book ended. But there is no quick fix for long-term low self-esteem, anger, and poor emotional management, so changing one's life is a long, difficult process. Kuffel simply tells her own story up to the point she has reached in that process. It is not necessary for Kuffel to complete or perfect her psychological journey in order for us to learn from her -- we see what she has accomplished, and why, and we ponder where she needs to go from here."
4,Incredible story...,"I read this novel in 2 days. Kuffel, at age 42, weighed 313 pounds. After joining a 12-step program, she lost 188 pounds.Kuffel begins by explaining what her life was like at 300+ pounds. I recognized so many of my own thoughts and feelings in what she said.As other reviewers have noted, once Kuffel joins the program, she seems to lose her weight over a few pages. There's barely anything of the struggle to get started and stay on her program. She seems to move right into being thin and adjusting to her new life. That's the only disappointment here for me. I would have liked to hear more about what she did, how she felt while she lost weight, etc.Despite it's shortcomings, I would recommend this to anyone. She has a wonderful sense of humor, and is a great storyteller."
3,Passing for Motivating,"This was just okay for me. Nothing earth shattering, there was a rather downtrodden, negativity throughout that I picked up on a lot with this book, I suppose a reality that lost weight does not change a life. I was rather disappointed in the graze by of the actual weight loss, something I was looking for- the step by step experiences of the loss.I was looking for something to motivate me and keep me going, this definitely was not it. Definitely not a motivating thing in it, actually. A good read, but only if you are looking for a basic story of weight loss."
1,very disapointing movie,"This movie was very entertaining for my 3 year old daughter. However it did not have very accurate information. I have owned horse on and off all my life, and was very dissapointed in the video. I rented the movie from a video store, and was very glad I didn't waste my money on buying it. I surely will not let my daughter watch it again."
4,Cooking for dummies,Great to buy used for a college person moving off campus.My son used it the first time he got it and it is a great tool for a beginning cook.
4,ok but needed better explanation,needed better explanation - some of the plants were hard to figure out what their name was so i guess just google it.
4,gigi strip free microwave formula,I love this wax. I have PCOS and it causes me to have more hair on my face then I should have. I bought this from a salon store and thought hey lets see if it works? It did. No you don't need muslin strips to take it off but it helps and if you don't have muslin use coffee filters. If you don't follow the directions then this product doesn't work right. Hope this was helpful.
5,Happy Birthday Fairie,"I gave it to women that just got married July 22, 2006. And her birthday was July 24. So just two days after she took her wedding vows. When she had her bridal shower I gave her the other kitchen fairies that go with the wedding theme. And she just fell in love with them that she put a curio cabinet in her kitchen so everyone can see them. She also thought that being that their in the kitchen that it would help her be a better cook to her new husband. How small is this world it is also her parents anniversary, too!!!"
1,Not good!!,"Doesn't make sweat just really boring. DVD has poor quality,routines are just hard to follow. But my main thing is after using this DVD for 60mins I didn't feel like I just worked out."
4,nice,"this album is very worth checking out. its very relaxed, sweet and caring! haha. song 8 (patience) is such a great song. Land of the loops reminds me of Global Goon (rephlex) because of the funny hip hop beats... i actually like Global Goon better production and song wise, but the vocals that Land of the Loops incorporates make it very worthwhile. the vocals also really remind me of the His Name is Alive album ""stars on ESP""... which is such an awesome album."
4,A lightweight kit with several useful/ essential items.,"This kit contains the basic first aid materials plus a few bonuses that were impressive. It should be good for most injuries occuring in the environment for which it was designed. Nice, light weight case- I like the waterproof bags inside the case."
2,International National Kit,"I took this on a small fishing boat trip since it was an inner bag which featured a leakproof, waterproof and airtight seal. My small fishing boat took on water and I was swimming for land. Fortunately the lightweight outer bag survived.Upon opening it, many items were out of date or just didn't work, like the band-aids, medical tape and oinkment. This Kit is also not fireproof as I found out when I fell asleep by my campfire and it caught fire."
5,better than good,I am not sure if it was ever intended for this use but I used it to resurface a 40 year old fiberglass pool slide that was showing considerable wear. I applied four coats over several hours and it has performed better than good over the entire summer with moderate use and many of plus 100 degree days. Very happy with the quality of this paint. If you have ever priced pool slides ($300-$1100) you can see why I chose an alternative route. I used Krylon K02329000 Fusion for Plastic as a base coat and then the Rust-Oleum Painter's Touch Spray as a top coat.
4,flying circus,if you are a physics teacher this is a good one for your library. You won't use it everyday but it is nice to have.
1,Not Very Good,"I think this book was kind of stupid and also I think the author has not much knowledge on horses because she calls them ponies. However, my cousin who is twelv knows about horses and says ten year old girls would not fitt on pnys because they are very little. I agree with the reviewer who said it was stupid and that acorn should get his own way. He or she is ritght. Anna and Pam And lulu is mean to their ponys. Please do not post nasty messages about how that reviewer who thought it was cool how ponies leap. He or She has the right to an opinion!Thank you!"
5,Great stuff,"I have been reading the web comic for a long time and its good to have something you like so much on the internet, in paperback form. It translates well into a book and I'd recormend it to a teenager with a vivid imagination, that is because you'll need it :)My only problem is that the book is monochrome, and the shading is a little off, but the resolution is good and the text is clear, all in all, well worth ten US DollarsI will be one of the first to buy volume 2"
4,The Long Hot Summer ...,"Great collection of SC's singles. A perfect summertime record full of jazzy-poppy tunes. Yeah some politics too, but it sounds pretty. The 12"" of Long Hot Summer is to die for. Really. It is. Sit outside, pour a glass of wine and relax ..."
2,PAUL WELLER'S FAILURE,"Ok, don't get me wrong I'm a major Paul Weller fan, since 1977, but apart from a couple a gems like 'Solid Bond' and 'Shout To The Top' this is Weller at his worst.After the rise and rise of The Jam, he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.Don't waste your money on this rubbish, go buy The Jam boxset and listen to Weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band EVER!"
4,Very poorly documented greased lightning.,"This is one very fine removable disk drive. It records files at a terrifying rate. My only gripe with it is the documentation. I know I am an old coot who stopped learning a lot about computers when it became unnecessary to wrestle with DOS and BASIC, and I still like the comfort of a manual that can be read to settle one's nerves while putting a new toy to work. The instructions accompanying this fine piece of equipment is something Iomega should be mightily ashamed of."
4,"Good movie, better soundtrack.","Though I did like things about the film (Winona), I like everything about the music. And, I admit the tracklist is pretty typical, but that's also what makes it so good. It's classic rock. How can anyone not like an album full of Hendrix, CCR, Canned Heat, Zombies, Blind Faith, CSN, and more? If this disc doesn't make you feel like it's 1969, nothing will. In fact, I relate it to the times way more than the movie. It's hard not to. Give it a spin the next time you light up the insence."
2,don't even need to see it,"that's right. it means you can't duplicate the spirit of something that doesn't exist anymore, just like grandpa, gone. if you weren't there, eat your heart out with yet another dismal, depressing shot at packaging and merchandising the 60s, 90s style. i pity you"
5,Best of the Trilogy,"It may be a sad way to end the ""light-hearted"" series, but it's based on what happened to Neil Simon in real life. Easily the most poignant of the trilogy, and the best dramatic work. It's a pity this probably isn't going to make it to DVD, as people don't like ""sad"" with their ""funny""."
3,Had difficulty sitting for the entire video,"Sorry, must be my ADD that caused me to lose interest after 30 minutes. Thought I'd return to finish the video, but forgot until after the 7 day loan period. Am a bit curious to the ending however!"
5,Most durable truck ever!,"This truck has lasted a few seasons outdoors and when washed, you would never know. Great buy!"
3,Get the smaller size,"Super Repair is an excellent product and skin saver for extemely dry skins. I felt the professional product had a more liquidy texture rather than the thick, almost balmy feel of the 1.7 oz size. The tube will literally drip into the lid if sat in the position pictured. I don't know if there is a change in consistency because it is marked professional or for other reasons I am unaware of -- this is just my experience with it."
3,"Heavy, Sort of Sticky Moisturizer",I find this product hard to apply as it is quite thick and oddly enough sort of sticky. I think it's more for someone with very dry skin altho be careful not to get more wrinkly by dragging on delicate facial skin as you apply!
5,Excellent learning program!,"This is an outstanding product. I just started listening to CD 3 today, and already I'm putting together sentences on my own based on previous material on the first two CDs. Before finding this kit, I tried Berlitz (with singing) and Eyewitness' 15-minute Italian. Both of those programs fall far short of the teaching technique used in Speed Italian. This program is actually working! Also the quality of the recording is excellent. I can clearly hear every syllable the native speaker pronounces (which isn't true of all CD programs), and they leave plenty of pause time for the listener to repeat the phrase or sentence. I listen to this all the time in my car now. I can't wait to go to Italy so I can carry on a conversation!"
4,Great Option for Older Laptop,"This is a great option for an older laptop that didn't have an HDMI port. I'm able to connect to the TV to do anything you can do on your computer, although I typically use it only for streaming video feeds. In that regard, when I connected to an older tube TV which had just one set of video/audio connections (again another reason for having this), video & sound worked great. Having some difficulty getting the audio to work when connecting to my newer LED TV even though it still has the same video/audio connections as a choice."
4,Good cable,Product is as advertised and works well. It is a bit stiff and heavy and awkward but hat is probably the nauture of a combo/s-video cable of this sort. Happy with how it connects my laptop to our TV for video watching.
1,BEWARE: THE PICTURE IS FALSE,"This cord was NOT what I thought it was going to be. It did not come with an audio cable, it looks NOTHING like the picture at all. It is a single black cord that connects to S-Video and RCA Video port. It is a 4-plug S-Video instead of a 7. As of right now, I'm extremely dissatisfied."
3,"Decent Range, Terrible Customer Service",I have found my radios to work 3- 4 mile on GMRS mode. The 1st time my wife and I used them both of the belt clips broke. I have e-mailed motorola R.E. this matter and asked for replacement belt clips. And have never recieved a response.
5,Great music and an unheard of value.,"Guitar organ trios are cool, but there's something special in jazz about the two-guitar, bass, and drums combination. This CD presents two top jazz gutarists, Howard Alden and Jimmy Bruno, with Michael Moore on bass and Alan Dawson on drums. This label, Concord Records, released a legendary 2-guitar record, ""Jazz/Concord,"" with Herb Ellis and Joe Pass on guitar, in 1972, and that disc is included for free in this package! The late Carl Jefferson, the moving force behind Concord Jazz Fest and this record label, just decided to give it to the fans. I can't recommend this one highly enough. By the way, accompanying Ellis and Pass are Ray Brown on bass and Jake Hanna on drums. One more interesting thing: both Howard Alden and Jimmy Bruno play seven-string guitars, and it's interesting to listen to both discs and think about whether 14 strings in the '90s is as good as 12 strings in the '70s."
5,A quite interesting book,"This is indeed a quite interesting book, the best story for me is The Butterfly That Stamped.On the other hand, I was surprised by the author's great patience in writing How the Alphabet Was Made."
3,Rudyard Kipling stories,"The stories are great which is why I ordered the book. A bit disappointed in the illustrations.Perhaps my grandchildren will enjoy it more when they begin to read more chapter books, with less pictures."
3,Confusing information,"I give 5 stars to Kipling's ""Just So Stories"", just as I did decades ago when my mother first read them to me from the 1952 edition illustrated by Nicolas, but only three stars for Amazon's misleading presentation. Unfortunately, although the book cover depicted is the same as my 1952 edition, the various book choices listed with it, except for the used ones from booksellers for $289+, are not the the same; in fact, they appear to have far fewer illustrations, which are black and white and not by Nicolas.If the stories are most important, there are several good editions; however, if you are also looking for brightly colored, fanciful illustrations that will capture the attention of younger children, I suggest that you look carefully. I cannot not find one for my grandchildren where the stories and pictures are as well integrated as the 1952 edition.Literatelily"
3,Not quite as new,"Advertised as ""Like New"", I believe. Not quite, but still good condition. Like the paperback version, good for parents to read to children to help with the offensive parts."
2,not the best version,"I would stay away from this version of the Jungle book. I thought Boris Karloff would make a great narrator, but he doesn't this time. He tends to make the storyline hard to follow, emphasizing in odd places and then raising his voice tremendously as tho he were on stage. My kids were put off by that, and they love Jungle Book. They don't like listening to this."
5,You must read this bestseller!,"This story is great!!!!!!!!! Buy it! It has wonderful stories!!! Like the camel who said ""HUMPGH"" and the whale story. You must read this book! I really like the story when the elephant gets his trunk stretched. That's why some people think that's how elephants have long trunks today. This book is full of mythical legends. The first story realy cracked me up! TAKE MY ADVICE, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you like stories like this, GET this book! ___________________________________________________ You MUST buy it! @ take my advice! You won't regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE.'Buy it!,' said the whale. Signed, Will"
3,NOT metal,"This truck is supposed to be metal, but it's not. It's plastic. It does have a metal barrel (the white part) but the rest is just plastic. Overall I'm disappointed."
5,Grandson loves it.,"I bought this as a birthday present for my 6 year old grandson; he specifically requested a cement mixer. He was absolutely thrilled when he opened it, and he plays with it frequently."
3,Some disassembly required,"To my surprise and without instructions, I had to disassemble the white metallic portion and twist it in order to get it to rotate after reassembly. Had I known this, I wouldn't have tried to forcibly get it to rotate and damage it slightly. Size was good enough."
2,"Slow, a bit convoluted","I was surprised that I had trouble getting into this as I am a patient reader. I tried to become interested but I couldn't identify with any character and the transitions were abrupt. I did give this two stars because it is ""a classic"" and it was free."
5,"A book and edition which redefine ""fabulous""","As Melvillians will know (and as new readers will discover), this is an astoundingly modern work in the guise of an 'older' style. Re-reading it in this new edition is especially rewarding: abundant and illuminating notes, essays, and reviews in a beautifully produced book make for a very rich reading experience -- I got much more out of this reading than from earlier encounters with other editions. Highly recommended."
2,Even hedonistically it's not very good,"This book isn't that bad, but it certainly isn't that great, either. Overall unremarkable next to so many other excellent historical fiction novels or just plain adventurous fantasy novels. This book would be much better if the characters weren't caricatures, if the dialogue wasn't so artificial, generally if the writing were up to the standards of the field. But I enjoyed it in the way that I sometimes enjoy junk food. So I don't care about the historical accuracy of this book, the problem with this book is the sophomoric writing and all-around sub-standard story-telling."
4,Marxism is a de luxe product,"This book is a biography about an american oil mogul:Armand Hammer.The author is a jew, as the biographed.If you read this book, you will see a true:marxism(leftism, eugenicism, environmentalism, feminism, etc.) is something for millionaries.Hammer got a fortune linking to former Soviet Union's interests.Then he went to oil business.Again he linked his oil business to Lybia, even to Khadafy money.Defects of this book are small.I don't believe ,that Al Gore had school's payment from Hammer.Another problem,of this book,is to forget that Hammer was a little linked to eugenics movement, at least until Hitler's time in 1933.These are small problems.This book is good."
3,Guitars are the pathway to bliss,"First of all, much thanks must go out to Neil Young for making this CD possible. The gorgeous cover of ""Cortez the Killer"" is absolutely a must hear for Neil Young fans, Doug does his mentor proud. Better set aside 20 minutes of your life if you wanna listen to it all, though (wow). ""Broken Chairs"" is another song that will take a significant notch out of your day. I have seen BTS play the tune, and it is so good and filled with energy live. This take goes on, and I really like music that ""goes on"", but it can't replace the fever I felt seeing it live (which isn't a knock, it's to be expected). One of my favorite BTS songs, ""I would kill a fly"", shows up here but doesn't take the song anywhere new.Still, if you have a craving for guitar solos ala Neil Young electric or J Mascis (Dinosaur Jr.), then this will fill your plate and your belly, I promise you that."
5,"If you like pretty, cute pop...","sung in French, this album is excellent. I do not, however, like any of what Ms. Paradis did after this album.Even if neither speak nor understand French, the songs are beautiful and easy--definitely worth having on hand.Although pure pop, the arrangements, instruments, and vocals on this album bear no resemblance to pop produced by other beautiful, young women of the time (e.g., Kylie, Spice Girls)."
3,Not Lizzy's Best,"A largely subdued album, and a bit of a dropoff between Vagabonds of the Western World and the creation of the traditional Lizzy sound on Fighting, Night Life finds its best moment in the mournful blues of ""Still in Love With You."" But, for the most part, it doesn't live up to the rest of the Lizzy catalog."

4,The First Steven Seagal Movie.,"When ex-soldier turns Cop (Steven Seagal) in the Streets of Chicago. When he decides to takes on the Corrupted CIA Officers, who were involve in a Conspiracy in the Vietnam War.Directed by Andrew Davis (The Package, Under Siege, The Fugitive) has made a Top Notch Action/Thriller. This was a small hit at the Box Office in Theaters, it was also Seagal`s first film but it`s a gained a cult following on Video also, which it did made Seagal a new action star. The Supporting Cast include:Pam Grier, Sharon Stone, Daniel Faraldo and Herny Silva. This film is a strong entry for Action Buffs. Story by Andrew Davis and Steven Seagal. Screenplay by Steven Pressfield (He wrote the novel of The Legend of Bagger Vance) and Ronald Shusett (Alien). Grade:B+."
3,below par,"it's kind of amazing when you watch pop movies 25 years after they were made and realize...wow did i really like that. Steven Segal is still cool. He can't act, then or now, but really he never set out to make timeless classic, just fun fluff. I like his newer movies, but taking the time machine back...well it just wasn't the same as I remembered."
3,But Not Above Criticism,"If you enjoy the conspiracy theory at the heart of this Steven Seagal action film, you'll find this film quite good. If you do not, well the action scenes are a bit more brutal and in a fashion more realistic (martial arts fights don't last very long etc), and there's nice support from Pam Grier. Sharon Stone is here too. That might be enough for you to enjoy it.The story is about a tough no-nonsense cop that's about to make an important drug base but is told to back off. Why? What's going on? This was Seagal's first film and his acting is much stiffer than it is in later films (really). It's his second best film (behind Under Siege). It was also directed by Andrew (Under Siege, The Fugitive)Davis who knows how to direct action sequences and went proved it to a wide audience in The Fugitive."
2,From a time when Seagal could still move.,"It's hard to imagine that this ""Olivier"" of action films is now in his 60's. Well, this movie goes to show that bad acting and dialogue were always a part of his repertoire, but in the best possible way. The great thing to notice in this master piece of American cinema is that you can still see Seagal with his own hair, way before the doll hair surgery. Enjoy best with a few Gin 'n' Tonics and a bowl of Pizza Hot Pockets."
5,"cute pictures and comic descriptions, and a wonderful text","The basset hound owner's survival guide is appropriately titled, and gives wonderful insight into the charachter of the breed.I have read many basset hound breed books, but this one was different in that it contained so much humor and whimsical fancy, which is so necessary when you are the owner of this particular breed. :)I highly recommend it to all basset hound enthusiasts....you will not be disappointed."
5,wow!!,"I have had this book for years, I still never get tired of it. I wish the author/photographer would have done another book"
3,Be cautious! a lot of errors,There are so many careless errors in the most important equations in this book. Some plots are wrong too. Some claims are ungrounded.Not for entry level. For expert who already knows this stuff and who can easily spot his errors. Otherwise you will be so confused and almost wanted to kill yourself after sitting there staring at those erroneous equations. Should be used as a reference only if you have decided to make fiber optics your life. I had my worst year in college reading this book. My professor also agrees somehow with me that this book needs to be revised.
2,broke within a week,I was expecting more for paying so much for this toy. within a week of my sons birthday the gray piece that moves the shovel on the backhoe broke. The excavator that I paid $13.00 for at Target is still going strong. should have gotten all of my toys from Target. I would have saved a lot more money. Fun to look at not very durable.
2,Charger extremely touchy and won't work easily,"I love the earpeice. However, the charger is extremely touchy. When you plug the ear bud into the charger, a red charging light should appear. It takes more than 3 times to get the lite to come on. I don't think its making a good connection. It will charge-eventually, but only after having played around with it to get it to connect. HUGE URRGGHHH."
2,Not as pictured,"The magnet I received was not as pictured on the web site. Both the word ""Boston"" and the seams on the baseball were red in color rather than the blue pictured.But Amazon did make the return process extremely easy."
3,Good material with sonic anomalies,"There are some great songs on this CD. Biff Rose's best known song, ""Fill Your Heart"" is included, of course, but several others are just as good if not better: ""What's Gnawing at Me,"" ""Just Like a Man,"" and ""Mama Told Me,"" to name just a few. The downside for me is that this CD is mastered from vinyl, and not great vinyl at that. There are frequent pops and clicks and occasional loud distortion. I presume this is the best the label could do as the design and packaging are lovingly prepared, but it is still a disappointment."
4,Biff's Riffs Are Like Old Friends,"I first heard Biff Rose while watching the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. I was probably in the 10th grade, so that would make it 1968 or 1969. This charming entertainer with his Pepsodent striped coat and bushy mustache made me smile and feel good. I immediately went to the record store and bought his record and would listen to Biff's stories late at night. I imagined singing about my own ""Molly"" and together, we shared tales of love lost and love regained. Before too long I could sing along every song and to this day I ""fill my heart with love"" and ""avoid the game of time.""When I went to college someone broke into my dorm room and stole my whole record collection. I was incensed that they took Biff....I mean really!This album is not for everyone, but if you're a hopeless romantic (like me) or you enjoy a clever phrasing, a witty lyric, or just a good old corny oddball, (I do) then you should give it a try. You may very well find your next best friend."
4,A book of paradoxes,"I was given this book by someone who knows I have read Churchill with satisfaction before. This book was captivating, fascinating, and left me acutely aware of the author's deeply thoughtful reflections on Christianity as a viable way of life. The fact that many of the hurdles faced by today's church are the same as those facing the characters of the book struck me, as did the fact that some of the problems addressed have taken turns unanticipated by the author. At times I deeply agreed and at other times was astounded and saddenened at the direction taken and conclusions drawn. God is still in control, regardless. This book made me reflect on aspects of my own life which need to be re-evaluated."
5,Simply great,"A fantastic, fun, journey into the past. The two male leads are nothing short of great -- commanding and dynamic in their performances. This is a ""must see"" for everyone, not just sci-fi fans."
4,Mind blowing cosmology,"I used this book for a paper in college. I was in a class about North American Indians. The book is an excellent recounting of the Skidi Pawnee thoughts and practices about their cosmology, their view of the world and its creation. The strories are very intricate and fun to read! Writing is a little dry. Enjoy!"
4,The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells,"Awesome sci-fi action and horror novel.Recently a scientist named Griffin has found a way to turn skin, blood, and tissue invisible. Griffin has checked into a hotel in a small town in Iping. He is a tall man with a shiny pink nose. His head is wrapped in bandages, and he wears a pair of glaring blue glasses. In his room he sits in his chair, smokes his pipe, talks to himself, and does strange experiments. As soon as this man comes to town, weird things begin happening like floating furniture and unexplained robberies. What is this man doing in this small town? Citicens in this town start to hear voices and see doors and windows unlock themselves. Could this man be the cause of the occurrences? This book has many plot twists and surprises. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. While reading this book you want to know what happens next. This book will captivate all readers. The Invisible Man is an extremely exciting book that must be read!"
5,Thrill & Chill,"This is a great documentary and thrilling movie. Being able to see two Olympic gold medalists and snowboarding pioneers at the same time is a treat. The cast is a diverse group that has one thing in common, the love of snowboarding. It is a must see for winter sports fans of all ages."
1,Attention Sean White Fan Boys!,"This is a great movie if you like hearing smug little brats like sean white talk about how cool they are. The snowboarding footage in this is a joke. I cannot believe that reviewers have compared this to riding giants, which I found to be an amazing documentary. This movie is simply a forum for snowboarders to talk about how cool and ""edgy"" they are. I love watching winter sports flix, and I thought that this was a ridiculous waste of my time. If I had actually bought it I would be pissed."
2,Price of double CD is way too high!,"I would be better off with the single edition than the deluxe. The price is TOO HIGH for it in some stores--$27, $28, $34 or $32 in some places. This sounds more like a greed thing for Boyz II Men than the music itself. Plus the song selection isn't very well done with the remixes and other songs along with the hits. I liked the 13-song set of this album better than this bloated package. The high price for it is a complete turnoff and it should have been affordable for the consumer. While Boyz II Men get high marks for their music and harmonizing, this double CD packaging comes off as distracting and misguiding and not as well done as other artists' greatest hits' compilations."
5,Classic way to capture all the hits.....all in one Disc!,"This cd is a collectors item alone just with the collection of songs and everything on this disc. For any fan this cd is a must....and any non-fan should check this out for a sample of what is called ""Boyz Ii Men"". On this cd they give you hits....they give you videos, photos and behind the scene clips that gives you a more play out of the cd than you would expect. Even thought their last cd didnt blow up like it should(anyone who hasent heard it yet should check it out)........thier sound and presence as a group will always leave a mark for all the new groups to follow.There is no hesitating on this cd....just get it!"
1,this is not REAL black music,"These guys were the nirvana of r&b;,motown, soul, black music in the 90s. As nirvanawas the band that ended good white music.boyz to men was the band that ended good black music.I am kinda pissed because nobody seems to noticeit like i do. These guys especially the lead singer wouldalways sing, oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence.I mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or rick james.i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul type music.barry white, whitney houston, bobby brown, the temptationsIsaac hayes luther vandross.i mean in the 90s i think almost every r&b; group wasbetter than boyz to girls. i dont understand whythese guys are so popular.I guess its just like seinfeld it sucks badbut people like it. its like all these idiotswere born yesterday forgetting about qualitymusic and sitcoms from the past that were better."
3,For very traditional Catholics,"I just finished reading this book to my 8-year-old daughter last night. She was so glad that Dilecta finally got to the Golden City! Clearly she did not realize this meant that the little girl died.I have mixed feelings about this book. The theology seems to be sound Catholic doctrine, but the lanugage and usage are now so old-fashioned that I often had to stop and explain what the writer was saying.My daughter enjoyed the book. I wanted to love it and be moved by it, but I didn't and wasn't. I think if your child is familiar with older, pious Catholic texts then this is a great book for you. Maybe (like my daughter) your children will enjoy it even if the language seems strange."
4,worth the read,"A very informative book on the Iran Hostage Crisis.Worthy of a read, however, maybe not a purchase."
4,Research Pays Off Again,Bowden has done it again. Balancing multiple storylines to weave together a thorough understanding of the crisis. Of course the story of Desert One helps lift the book beyond its dominant political themes.
4,How come Hollywood hasn't made a movie of this?,"Bowden does a great service to the hostages in detailing their story in this very readable account. The main disappointment is his pandering to the left in implying that America was somehow responsible for the hostage taking by supporting the Shah (still the best ruler Iran has ever had, even if he was a tyrant). He is also very soft on Carter, ignoring the massive failings of the administration on many issues, including this one, which led the terrorists (""students"") to think they could get away with the seizure, which they did. Still, the account is accurate in its details and is long overdue."
2,MISSION GALACTICA: UNIVERSAL ATTACKS,"Im very disappointed. This is actually a butchered verson of THE LIVING LEGEND, a two-parter, with a few unseen special effects from the series. The problem here is they cut off the ending of the two-parter, and replaced it with the finale of THE FIRE IN SPACE, another Galactica episode that came later in the series. Having seen LIVING LEGEND in its entirety on TV, I can say they sacrificed drama for spectacle by deleting or shortening several key sequences of character interaction. The end of the tape is an abomination, a mess of bad editing and confusing dialogue that makes no sense, having been a paste of the endings of two different stories. LETS HOPE UNIVERSAL RELEASES ""THE LIVING LEGEND"" INTACT!!!"
3,Money please,"This was obviously an attempt to make some more money off of Galactica, probably overseas. I never saw it released in the states, thank god. Stick to the original movie, ""Saga of a Star World,"" and pray that the powers that be will update Galactica with a new movie, bringing back the original cast and special effects based on MODELS, not fake looking computer generated stuff. If there was ever an argument for non CG effects, it's the new Star Wars movie."
2,"Er, not good","I was 12 when this series orignally came out. Now, twenty years later, the episode that used to be my favorite, ""The Living Legend,"" is obviously, well, underwhelming. The editing of the Fire in Space footage was horrible, just an excuse to extend this ""movie"" by another 20 or 30 minutes. There was really no speculative element to this movie at all, which was the problem with most of the BG episodes. It was just another simple-minded shoot-em-up, an excuse to replay their fx another dozen or so times each. Now that I'm not a kid anymore, I realize the episodes I used to like the least are in fact the best -- episodes like War of the Gods and The Long Patrol where the cylons were not really involved and there were some provocative, speculative ideas. It figures now that I'd really like to see War of the Gods, it's unavailable on video. Oh well. Also: why in the world were the sound effects for the cylon ships moving through space changed?"
1,Solidly made piece of JUNK!!,"Where do I begin to detail my dissatisfaction?1) The push to talk button is countersunk into the side and takes a HARD push to activate it.2) The supposed 5 mile range of these units proved to be less than 1 mile.3) The poorly placed volume button was consistently being adjusted (unintentionally)by the merest movements.4) The belt clips.... don't even get me started.5) The menu driven controls are counterintuitive.6) The ring tones WEREN'T BAD, actually.7) The clarity of signal was mediocre (even within 20 feet of one another)."
3,Not exactly pretty for the price,"Ordered this as it is the only pan this size I could find (I require it for specific almond flour bread recipes)- the soldering on the edges is pretty rough looking, and the pan was quite scratched despite being in a sealed plastic bag. I haven't used it yet, am sure it will work fine but overall not impressed with the finishing for the price."
2,This book can seem better than it really is,"I've read this novel twice. Once, when I was younger and I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. The second time I found everything that I liked the first time to be unbelievable this time around. Puzo is a very limited writer. He can write a certain type of character very convincingly, but when everyone in all his novels is just a certain shade of a single personality, you start dying for a little variety in the people you're reading about. Trust me. This book can seem better than it really is."
5,Bookworm,I find that at 70+ years I enjoy the Hardy Boys as much as I did when I first read the books my father gave me.Books that he had when he was a boy!.The Bookworm
1,Who is Jezebel?,"Do we not study for ourselves? Because if we did we would know that the Jezebel spirit is a spirit of control. Not so much of red fingernail polish and seduction. Control. It is a shame that we do not study for ourselves. Women have been labeled ""Jezebel"" for too long."
4,Classic.,"Although this older book's black and white drawings may not be the most attractive students encounter, the use of poems to describe people and events is an interesting and unique way to teach US history. English language learners may particularly enjoy the way a poem plays with the sound, rhythm, and images of language. The book spans a wide range of time and people. In just a minute or two, a poem may be able to engage students through the rhyme, rhythm, and images."
5,Delightful Poems of American History,"This is a book of poems about people and events in the history of the United States. They are arranged chronologically from Christopher Columbus in 1492 until the book's publication in 1933. I remembered some of the poems from my days in elementary school, and I used others in my own classroom when I became a teacher. The rhythm, and often the humor, of the poems is appealing to children, and I found them very helpful in teaching history units. My students got so used to poems by Rosemary and Stephen Vincent Benet that when we came across a poem by only Stephen, one boy said, ""Rosemary didn't help him?"" Some of my favorite selections in the book are ""Western Wagons,"" ""Southern Ships and Settlers,"" ""French Pioneers,"" and ""Nancy Hanks."" The illustrations unfortunately are a bit smart-alecky, but the poems speak for themselves. I love this book and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
2,Starter book,A book for someone who is wanting to begin exploring theatrical costume design or production.
5,Two thumbs up!,"This book was recommended to me by a coworker when I was working at one of the big four in the area of data mining. I was at first skeptical of the depth of its IT specifics but quickly realized that between the gripping lines of adventure the author skillfully embedded vital knowledge that's critical for anyone who wants to get the insight of corporate systems, IT infrastructures, and how they work together. In the format for a novel, the author took me on an exciting and informative ride in the world of corporate forensic investigation."
5,Awesome Cd,"This has got to be one of my favorite cds. If you are just starting to listen to Strung Out, you should start out with this cd, because it is mostly punk, and has a little metal in it. Then you can decide which part you like and go earlier into the band, which is more punk, or later, which is more metal."
2,"Product is great, price is bad","Great product, I use it daily. Only reason I got from Amazon was because Walmart was sold out. Much cheaper there. Go to Walmart instead.Otherwise, this is my favorite aloe. It's clear, unscented, and dries without being sticky."
2,it does almost nothing for my curls,"I purchased it to use as a moisturizer and light hair gel since it got great reviews for that type of usage. Unfortunately it does almost nothing for my curls and it often flakes underneath my makeup. Honestly, I never use it anymore. It sits in my bathroom untouched and nearly full. Will never buy again."
5,great hair gel!,I love this product! I use it as a hair gel for my curly girl hair. No obnoxious perfume smell and it doesn't dry out my hair. Walmart used to carry it and we would buy 6 bottles at a time. They have stopped carrying it and I am so glad to find it here at Amazon.
4,"I know this isn't pure 100% aloe vera, and I don't care","I'll be honest. When I purchased this 5 years ago at my local Wal-Mart, I thought it WAS pure 100%, and I didn't bother to read the ingredient deck. I don't think Fruit of the Earth tries to deceive, you need to read the labels on all products. I use this with my FaceMaster as conductive solution, and I've used it in the past when my dog had some type of allergic reaction to the grass, it made her more comfortable. I have re-purchased it since then, only because the bottle is huge and I never use it up before it starts getting cloudy."
2,Lacks the material of the first installment,"Definitely the second in the series, most of the more impressive of the great liners have already been discussed in the first installment, leaving us with some of the more interesting of the smaller liners, and a few early liners of some renown."
1,Great value & sound - while it lasted,"I bought this subwoofer about a year and a half ago. For that time it worked great until just recently. The sound was clear with a bunch of power. However, the other night I noticed that the area near it smelled ""hot."" I immediately unplugged the unit and noticed a black liquid/goo dripping out from under the amplifier. It concerned me that if I hadn't noticed the problem when I did, it could have started a fire. Of course the warranty has expired (go figure). I have written to KHL to see if this was just a defect in my unit or a product defect. I will post their response here. Unless I find out that this was just a problem with my unit, I would avoid this product at all costs."
1,Worst toy ever!,This toy was such a disappointment. My four year old could not care less about playing with this. It does not say together at all. All he wanted for Christmas was a space station...he cried when he saw this. Certainly not worth the 40 dollar price tag.
4,A must-read for journalists!,"After spending years as a member of the National Association of Black Journalists, it was a pleasure to read about the organization's illustrious history. I had heard many stories about how the organization was founded by dedicated journalists. But, here, finally, was a book that put all that information into a clear, concise way for me. I often refer to the book to gain a historical perspective on how Black journalists fought hard to gain acceptance at mainstream news organizations and to tell our stories only the way we can tell them. All journalists, especially Black journalists, should have this book in their library. It's a must-read!"
2,Poor quality,"Right out of the box, the machine was missing the zigzag presser foot. I called Brother and they said I had to contact the retailer. When I finally got the foot, the machine was inoperable. I never even got to sew anything! I purchased a Singer 1507 and I am very pleased."
4,Great machine for the price...,"This little machine is a great buy. Personally, I made the decision to buy because I got tired of paying tailors 10-15 bucks a pop just to take up a pair of pants. If you are a guy like me, make sure you read the instructions first. They even have pictures. It's not rocket science. ""Even a caveman...""Once you get use to the machine, it's like poetry in motion. Of course, I'm new at the sewing thing, but I have to say that the experience with this machine has been great. I got it on a Gold Buy for less than a hundred bucks (WOW), but I've seen it for as much as $270 (OUCH). For me, it will pay for itself in less than 10 alterations. Who knows, if I get good enough, I may start making some of my own stuff..or not. Anyway, as a starter machine, I highly recommend."
3,Good book but a little Dry,"CS Lewis was a fascinating Christian apologist in the 20th Century, who made his mark as a philosopher, teacher, and children's author. He is first and foremost a Christian, and it is from this perspective that Christian biographer Alan Jacobs examines him. The focus is on how Lewis's beliefs are reflected in his writing, and how his relationships influenced his character. I bought it to learn more about the reasons behind Lewis's Narnia books, and found it to be suitable for this. It is not a highly engaging read, being rather scholarly, but Mr. Jacobs has done superb research and the book is an important piece of work for anyone who wants to learn more about CS Lewis and his motivations.Three and a half stars."
5,Behind the Scenes in the World of Black Project Aviation,"I had picked up ""Dark Eagles"" primarly because it was one of very few books to present information on ""Have Donut"" and similar projects in which the United States tested captured MiGs and other Soviet aircraft. I was pleasantly suprised to find that the rest of this book is as superbly researched and detailed as Peebles' glimpse into the testing of foreign equipment.Peebles discusses, in amazing detail, the developments of such famous aircraft as the U-2, A-12, SR-71, F-117, ""Have Blue"" and ""Tacit Blue."" Peebles also delves into the history of the less-glamarous unmanned platforms such as the trisonic D-21 (""Tagboard"") and various models of the Model 147 Firebee, used extensively in Vietnam.This book is a must for anyone interested in black project aviation. It is well written and thoroughly researched, and is engaging to both the causal and technical reader."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a Sara Brightman fan for many years and was eagerly looking forward to this CD. I can honestly say that although Ms. Brightman's voice was, as always, excellent, the songs were disappointing and did not hold my interest. I have never written a ""review"" and I wish this could have been more favorable. But, there are many other brillant and rewarding recordings from Ms. Brightman for all to enjoy!"
1,Parents Beware,"My daughters and I have read or listened to many Judy Blume books and they have read many others. We have enjoyed them all. We picked this book on tape up at the library to listen to on a car trip. I was somewhat concerned about some of the language that was being used in the book and then became very concerned when the young characters started discussing their parents ""doing it"". At the second reference to ""doing it"" we turned off the tape. I was sure I must have made a mistake about the audience this was intended for. I read the back of the tape box again and it stated that the book was recommended for listeners ages 10 to 13. I don't know about other parents, but I definitely don't think the subject of ""doing it"" is appropriate for 10 to 13 year olds. I was very disappointed with this. Up to this point I had trusted that any July Blume book designated for juveniles would be of age appropriate subject matter."
1,Not so great,The pair I received were comfortable but the carbon fiber separated from the foam material after less than a week of use.
2,Mediocre,"I read reviews that compared this to the Oultlander series. Although set in Puritain England, it does have a fiesty heroine falling for a very unenlighted man. The writing is pedestrian and the plot obvious. Read her first novel ""Storming Heaven"" to see what she can really do."
1,RIP OFF!,"I bought my cartridge for the first time on the net, at Amazon.com rather then best buy to save a whopping 10 dollars! I purchased the same ink ribbon I ususally do. Shoul last 50 8 X 10 sheets. I printed 14 sheets and THE INK RAN OUT! incuding shipping I paid over 42 dollars!!!! THis website is selling a defective product!"
5,Spassov - fine jazz musician,We had an excellent jazz festival in Eilat - Israel this week (27th - 30th of August 2001). Spassov was one of the best performances we had there. Spassov is a fine musician who knows how to 'catch' the audience. His music is interesting and even more - exciting. If Spassov is in town - don't miss him.Thank you Spassov. You are always invited to us.!Menachem Schreiber
3,no title,"Short froth of a work with all too obvious plot - actually it was so apparent, I guessed something else, not dreaming it really was as the author lead one to believe. But, some very witty barbs, particularly about women and patriotism, and self-seeking nations. Nothing, simply nothing has changed on that score since 1923, when this book was written. The Irish, the Serbs-Croats, Russians, Turks, and Greeks, all is the same. Woman disguised as man - shades of ""The Crying Game"" or ""M. Butterfly"" in reverse. But no sex."
3,I like the Bangles.,"I only really remembered the main Bangles songs that I saw the videos for on Much Music or heard on the radio. I liked what I heard of them but I didn't hear a lot from them. I thought I'd buy the album to get the ones I remembered and basically sample some of the ones I've never heard of. In the end, the ones I remembered were the best on the CD. The others are a little forgettable in my opinion."
2,Electric Hoist,This hoist has good pulling power but when it starts pulling a load it pulls the spool in a downward motion and the cable all winds on the down side and soon builds up and contacts the auto shut off lever and shuts it down. I have tried to change the position that it is hooked on top to achieve the proper balance but that didn't help. It is pretty much usless if you have to lift over a foot or two.
2,Strays away,"I have read many translations of Patanjali now. These interpretations in some instances stray far from the sutra meaning. In other instances, the cross references with Christian and Biblical references may help those not familiar with things Eastern. There is no reference to the original Sanskrit words and roots that I find essential in understanding the meanings. I believe that this is a good first book for those who have little exposure to Indian scripture. I would hope people would find their interest piqued enough by this book to go deeper."
4,Good movies,This was given as a gift but good concept to put two movies on one DVD. I collect movies and I'm running out of room.
3,too small,"came to me fast, but the product was still delivered USPS and required an extra step for retrieval. I will have to make a note and not purchase from this vendor again.Springs are smaller than the first shipment and kitties don't care for them. Kitties like me to wrap a mylar crinkle ball with a large spring. They then use the spring to get toy to mouth so they can bring it back to me and play fetch again. This size is too small to allow them easy purchase to the spring."
1,"Great until it dies, then good luck","After 1 year of use it started showing green vertical pinstripes on alternate pixel columns.It has been 7 weeks now after repeated phone calls and promised email status updates that never happened. I am finally being told I am going to get a refund - not a replacement or repair. That in itself is unusual, it suggests to me there is something seriously wrong with the product, if they cannot or will not repair or replace it. Just yesterday they told me I was approved for a refund, but it may take UP TO 21 BUSINESS DAYS to receive it! What kind of business takes 21 days to cut a cheque? I have been a long term Samsung customer, (Typing this on a Syncmaster 2443 and my wife uses a 216 BW ) but I have had it with them. Ordered a replacement from Dell which I expect will be here long before I see my money back. (If ever)It's cheap and tempting and looks great up until it dies. Then woe to you trying to get a repair/replacement/refund!"
3,Great for gentle children,"This was a gift for my son. My 3ds just loves all things construction and enjoys imitating what they do at construction sites. He really loves scooping and dumping with these machines. Word of caution; the plastic is very flimsy/thin and we practically broke it getting it out of the box! After some initial frustration we were able to get it back together and ds enjoys it. NOT an 'outside, in the sandbox"" toy. If your child is rough with his/her toys, this may not be the right toy for you."
1,Cheap Truck for $55,I just received my order for this truck from Schaeff. I was so disappointed. It is made of cheap plastic and I am sure my son will be brake it within a day or two. Not worth the price.
4,good union between jazz and classical music,"It appears the classical outweighed the jazz on this project, but the group is solid and their cd projects have improved"
2,Utter dissappointment,This one really disappointed me. Not like Andrew Manze at all!I expected a great deal more with this work from him. It seemed as if he was just going through the motions to get the recording done. It is the first time I've ever felt this way about one of Manze's efforts.
1,Does NOT work with VISTA,"There are no driver windows VISTA! When I called and talked to Delkin they told me that they do not have estimate on when one will be availible. The XP driver will NOT install because it uses and temp directory that does not exsit on VISTA. Next I tried un zipping the XP driver manualy and install the drive myself. This worked for a few photos and then hung the machine.The short story here is if you have VISTA DON'T buy this card! It wouldn't work until they write a new VISTA driver and they don't seem to care about it. They offer no work around, no beta and no date that it will be fixed."
2,"OK, but not very practical","I had this toy on my son's wishlist based on the reviews I had read. The week before his birthday we picked up a three pack of tools at the dollar store. When he got this gift in the mail he was very excited to open it, but we soon discovered that some of the tools in the set were the flimsy ones we had gotten at the dollar store. Also, the tool belt is plastic and he won't wear it. When I think of a ""belt"" I don't think plastic. The good parts of this kit are the tape measure and the drill. We play with those often."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I will admit that all in all, my 4 year old really enjoys using this toy. However, that said, it is important to note it's (rather large) shortcomings.The tool belt will NOT stay on. My little guy is not overweight, but the tool belt has fallen off so frequently that he won't even wear it anymore. This is the whole reason this set was bought, as he LOVES tool belts.The drill was broken almost as soon as we got it out of the (very nice hard plastic) case. The bit won't spin, but the motor makes a sound as if it should be spinning. It's like something is broken on the inside.My little guy has more amusement in carrying around the plastic case this all arrived in - and not the tool case, but the weak plastic pieces it's held together in that you would normally throw away - than wearing the tool belt. Pass this one up and get some wooden tools, they hold up much better. I thought this was a deal, unfortunately I was wrong."
3,Fun little set,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He just turned 3, and out of all the toys at the family dinner, this was the one he was playing with the most. It's fun and easy to get at, and besides getting the batteries in the drill, no assembly required.The tools themselves are what you expect. The case really isn't all too fancy and I can see them all just being tossed in there at some point without any distinct place, because the holders for each of the tools is pretty flimsy.Overall I really like it, but the reason why I got it was that it was a ""tool belt"" and that was the one thing I was not very happy with. The belt itself is plastic, and does not stay clipped together well for a 3 year old on the move. It's a cheap plastic belt basically, and that's why I wouldn't really recommend this for other folks.If you just want a fun little tool set with a box to put em in, go for it. If you're looking for a nice little toolbelt, look elsewhere."
5,A very good toy,This toy is well made with many play tools and a tape measure. My grandson loved it. It comes in a good storage case also.
1,Tool belt stains and tools break,This product is not worth the money. I read all the reviews and thought it'd be a good buy but the tool belt stains everything it comes near and the tools breaks easily. Sure it comes in a nice box but it's huge compared to how much space the tools take up.I would not recommend the set. Go with something like Iplay's stuff. They always make some durable toys- not like this.I also purchased the Learnings Doctor's Set and unfortunately I'd have to give the same review to that set. Don't buy it. It's broken already.
3,I was expecting a better tool belt,"This was a christmas gift for my 2 year old son. He loves tools and the tools are great(I had to take away the screws for a few months so he doesn't choke on them). He really enjoys working drill! The toolbelt, however, was a complete disappointment. It is made of heavy plastic and doesn't even stay fastened to put it on my son! It is also way too big for his waist. I am now in search of a better tool belt. I guess for $27 I was expecting a little more."
4,Very Cute and Fun - only one small issue,The only reason I didn't give these cupcakes 5 stars is because sometimes they are hard to pull apart...but my daughter loves them and they are adorable and fun.
1,UNHAPPY :-(,"This cupcake set smells awful; Whether it's PVC/vinyl or other kinds of awful chemicals, I actually became nauseous after opening these from the horrendous smell. They are extremely difficult to put together/take apart, and both of my daughters (and myself) are frustrated by this. I've been looking forward to this set becoming a part of our play kitchen, and now I'm a bit afraid to let my daughters play with this due to the awful smell (yes, I washed the pieces as instructed--they still smell). I would return this set, but it's too much of a hassle with amazon. 2 thumbs down :-("
3,No Change,We have used this atlas for many years as we travel this wonderful country. Our only complaint has been and still is that they seem to just cut the map for the facing pages and they never seem to line up when you try to push them together due to the white space on each edge. I don't understand why they won't print an overlap on each page so it would be easy to follow a road from one page to the other. It always seems that what you are looking for is on the seam and it is difficult to see.
4,Atlas,"The road atlas had one page out of order so we had to take the binding out, put the page back in the right sequence and reinsert the binding. Other than that, the atlas is great."
1,Not worth it,This book is just a generic dog book with a few pages devoted to the French Bulldog. Those few pages have no information that even someone with a casual acquaintence with the breed would not know already.Save your money!
2,"Good, but could be better","This book is okay, but it could definitely be better. For a basic statistics class, this book contains WAY too much information to digest in a semester of college. No professor I know of has ever gotten past chapter 8. Further, the problems are quite wimpy as far as the amount of thought required for them. Quite wimpy. Could be better. The only good thing is that for doing it on a spreadsheet, the data comes on a CD, so that you don't have to re-type it, thankfully."
4,Time tested sound,"Unfortunately, the Xymox releases aren't going to appear of the upcoming ""Best of..."" and that's a real shame.""Evelyn"" is my favorite track, moody and gothic. ""Obsession"" is a nod to their earlier sound, very good as well. Brighter and much poppier but equally satisfying are ""Imagination"", ""Blind Hearts"" and ""In the City"".A lush, moody and masterful work that still sounds terrific."
5,Melodic stories with a gothic sensibility,"If you are the kind of person who likes stories and storytelling, then you'll like this album. Each lyric tells a story. Some of the music is quiet and thoughtful, some rocks out. Standout tracks for me were the title track, ""Scarlet""; ""Road To Your Soul"", and ""The Pearl Fishermen"", but I've had pretty much all of the tracks on this album stuck in my head at one time or another since I bought it. Highly recommended."
1,Grounds in my coffee....,"This product did not work for me. No matter what grind, quantity and type of coffee I've tried there is always sediment in the cup. Blech. I tried tamping it down and not tamping. Less coffee and more coffee. Brand A and brand B with the same sorry results. I must have looked like mad scientist in the kitchen making cup after cup with clear cups and measuring spoons strewn all over. Each experimental cup had too much grounds for me.I really think there needs to be a paper filter involved somehow. The mesh just lets too much coffee grounds through. I have read in some of the Amazon discussions that people have cut and fitted filters to line the My K-cup...I did try that and had water leaking everywhere so that was a bust too."
2,It was poorly made and it does not last long,"I bought this a few month ago, and on average make 2 cup of coffee a day. The edge is already worn out. I guess it will only last about 6 month time. I won't recommend it."
1,do not like this one,coffee grings get all over the place and you have to fiddle with that contraption you put the filter into.
4,Love it!,We never thought our Keurig could get much better BUT we were wrong. These reusable filters make us not only feel better about the price per cup but also the environment!!! We love them. The only improvement could be make them easier to clean out after each use.
5,Works perfectly,Save lots of money by using this. It flawlessly replaces the K-cups. Add whatever coffee you desire to the filter basket and put it in the Keurig. It is that simple.
1,Hated it!,"Listen. If I wanted weak, unremarkable coffee and the inconvenience of having a filter that had to be taken apart and cleaned every single time I wanted a cup of coffee, I wouldn't have bought the Keurig machine in the first place! I'd have saved myself about $80 and bought a Proctor Silex coffee maker at Rite-Aid.I wanted to like this thing. I really did. Who doesn't like to save a few bucks? But even using my favorite coffee (from Peet's) I was very unhappy with the results. Maybe if you start off with the Keurig machine using this device and remain unspoiled by the excellent K-cups available from Timothy's, etc. then this thing might be acceptable, but otherwise I consider it a major step backward in terms of coffee quality and the convenience of using this system."
2,Weaksauce,"I've talked this filter up. At work, we have a Keurig Mini. I use this filter all the time with that machine. It does NOT make my coffee weak. The Keurig itself and the filter are over a year old, and I love my coffee. It's the only thing I look forward to at work.Fast-forward to this Christmas. I finally get a Keurig for home: a B70 Platinum Plus. I purchased this same filter at Target. I was so excited this morning to have my delicious cup of Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla ground coffee using the filter.Oh, the disappointment.The coffee was noticeably weak, just by looking at it. Taste was awful. I tried 3 different times, using different cup sizes. All resulted in the same undrinkable, weak, tan water.I plan on bringing the filter from work home to see if it's a difference in filters, or a difference in machines. In the meantime, I suppose I will try buying one of the other-brand filters and hope for a normal cup of coffee."
1,I can't believe they sell this,"I've tried every thing to make this thing work...it doesn't. It makes weak coffee, with grounds in the cup. I have read all the posts that give ""fix it"" remedies. The thing just is poorly designed. Don't buy it."
1,Did not fit my Keurig,"Eventhough I was told to buy this product to go with my Keurig, it was not compatible with the Keurig that was sold to me bu Amazon."
4,Keurig K-Cup Coffee Filter,"Product works exactly as described; received from vendor in record time; nice to be able to use coffee bought from grocery store vs having to purchase multiple K-cups of coffee, tea or hot cocoa."
2,Keurig's poor business practice,"When I registered my new Keurig single cup coffee maker on line I took advantage of the company's offer to purchase four boxes of K-Cups for the price of two, with no additional cost for shipping, tax, or duty fee. When the order arrived there was $3.73 postage due. I reported this discrepancy to Keurig twice, but both reports have been totally ignored. True, $3.73 is a small amount to quibble over, but when their order confirmation email states zero charges for shipping then I expect Keurig to honor that offer. Surely Keurig knows the USPS costs for shipping their merchandise! I can only assume that it is Keurig's business practice to make the customer pay part or all of the shipping costs in order to save money for the company. I will not be making any future purchases from Keurig!"
1,Spillage instead of coffee,This seemed like a great idea. When brewing coffee half the cup spills from all around the sides and bottom of the brewer which leaves a mess on the counter and maker. I tried using only water with the same results. Good idea but not a working product. I'll be sticking to my K-cups. (Which may be the intention of this product anyway !!!)
1,1 star because 0 is not an option.,"I love my Keurig but this is a piece of crap out of the box. Sure, there are fixes. You can add an $0.10 washer to the top, you can modify an existing cup to fit inside and many other things, but when you pay $100 for a brewer and another $14-$16 dollars for THEIR filter you shouldn't be buying a starter kit that will work after you modify it.Did they not actually TEST these before they shipped them?I saw one reviewer mention she had to place a paper towel around the machine to avoid splashed water. Awesome!My $50 #6 melitta filter pot manages to get ALL the water in the pot and it doesn't cost .$60 a cup to do it.Of course all that water should be going somewhere else, like IN THE GROUNDS so her second complaint of weak coffee makes sense.I can't believe that no one at the factory noticed that these things look like a water fountain when you try to use them. They should have cherubs.So. If it's too late.. Watch this video for you .10c washer fix. It helps.[...]"
2,"Nice idea, but not worth it...","It leaks, makes very weak coffee, and is just a utter waste of money and time. I tried to cut a K-cup open and use that filter in addition to the one included, as instructed on some reviews, and that did not provide any significant difference. I then stumbled upon the Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers and its better than the my k-cup. I do not want to use K-cups due to the environmental factor, and the Solofill is probably a 3.5-4 star item, but still much better than the My K-Cup."
1,Admin Assistant,"the description for the filter I feel was a bit misleading. No where does it mention that this reusable filter can ""only"" be used with single cup home machines except of course that the picture on the box mentions single cup. I think the company should be much clearer in their wording. As far as the product goes, I wasted the money because I am now using the filter in the box as a paper weight in the reception area of our office because we simply can't use it. Great job! at least I was able to put it to some creative use. The cost of returning it is not worth the hassle and would mean I paid for something twice that I'm not able to use."
1,K-Cup filter....,"This filter put the coffe everywhere, you'd need a very wide cup to catch it all. I would not recommend you buy it, just a waste of money."
3,not well constructed but found a way to make it work,"Have just bought the coffee maker and k-cup and have to say they didn't think it thru when they designed the k-cup. Or did they? Just a way to get you to buy the already prepackaged, overly expensive single servings. I was curious to see if coffee grinds would end up in the cup like other customers have mentioned and sure enough it leaked around the edges and had grit in my cup. YUCK.. After playing around with it a few times I tore off a small square of foil and wrapped around the k-cup like the single servings have and wala... no more leaking or grit in my coffee. May seem a little time consuming for some (it's not really) but well worth it if you enjoy using your coffee maker like I do but don't want the aggrivation of trying to get a good cuppa."
1,My First Product returned To Amazon,"I won't go into a lot of detail....you've read the pros and cons of this product. Personally, I think it should be off the market - that's how bad I think it is. I tried many approaches using this filter before I gave up on it. Unless you like weak-to-medium strength coffee, don't bother. After many years of purchasing from Amazon, this is the first and only item I have returned for a refund....and I might add, Amazon went above and beyond the call of duty when processing this return. Thumbs up to Amazon, thumbs down to the reusable/(unusable) filter."
1,Never had a successful use,"I consider myself quite savvy when it comes to operating any kind of equipment or electronic, but for my life I have not been able to brew a decent cup of coffee, tea, or mate with this filter!! For what I paid for it I shouldn't have to be messing around trying to find the best way to use it...And even if I do, I always end up with weak coffee and coffee grounds all over...and the tea is horrible...Epic fail!"
2,Does not work for me....,I really had high hopes of being able to use my own coffee instead of always purchasing the k-cups. No matter what kind of coffee or how much I fill this thing the coffee is always weak. And when I empty it after using most of the grains are dry. If anyone has any ideas on this it would be great...
4,"Good, but a little bit of a pain to clean","This is a good product that definitely saves a little bit of money, but the coffee can sometimes be a bit hard to rinse out. Altogether, a good product."
3,Cheaper than K-cups,But coffee comes out weak. Maybe I'm just using too course of a grind? Good for those trying to save a buck
2,don't waste your money,If you like weak coffee this is for you. If you don't buy something else that might work alot better!!
2,Reusable Coffee Filter,"I like the idea of this product but it doesn't do the job. The K-Cup doesn't fit tight in the Keurig which allows water to leak out the sides. I like my coffee strong so with this system it gets watered down. If you like your coffee medium, to weak the K-Cup will be fine for you."
3,Paper filter!,"Hope they make a paper filter for k-cup. it would make a lot eassier to clean,faster to make a second cup and stronger coffee... hope keurig is listening!"
2,Makes a weak cup of coffee,"My husband likes weak coffee so he thinks it is great. It does not even come close to a Kcup coffee. I love the dark magic, a deep rich coffee. I thought it was possible that you need a finer grind, but then reading another reviewer he said it is the way the water goes thru this design. Now I will try the k caps. Some guy invented a cover for the coffee kcaps so you can reuse them. One I hate spening so much money on the dark magic and two I hate throwing the things into our land fill! In search of a green strong coffee."
2,"Great idea, but too grainy!","I love this idea, because I like Starbucks coffee and miss it some mornings. The reusable single cup is a bit messy to fill. It is easy to pop this in, but the coffee it produces is filled with grains. I have tried to fill it less, to get the coffee ground as coarsely as possible and still get grains in the cup. I would not recommend this."
2,not so much,"I was not in love with this. I found it made a week cup of coffee and left a lot of sediment in the bottom, which didn't make much sense to me. Took a long time to get the filter. After using this filter, I did a little more research and discovered the Ekobrew filter. Much better. I bought the stainless steel elite cup and it works great. Hope this helps."
3,Okay,"I may not be quite using this product right, but it does seem to make the coffee a bit weaker. If it worked, it would make the Keurig experience amazing since putting my own coffee in the reusable cup is cheaper!"
3,Kind of a pain,I bought this in hopes to save a little money on the expensive k cups. I had problems with water spilling over the top but I went online and read a review that said to pull down the little gasket on the needle so it would create a better seal. That worked but I still don't enjoy using this thing. I suppose it's fine if you like a small single cup of coffee in the morning but I usually like to have at least two and so does my husband. That requires taking it out and cleaning in four times. You have to be sure to clean it very well or it won't drain the coffee properly. It also doesn't make a very strong cup of coffee. I think we will buy another coffee maker to brew our Dunkin's coffee in to save us a lot of hassle and just use the Keurig for a true single serve moment. :)
1,Might as well make your own filter...would probably work better,"Like many people who have bought this product, I was looking for a way to brew my own favorite coffees in a reusable filter without the cost and waste of traditional K-cups. Well, I'll never do that again - it was just horrible. I followed each step of the directions, made sure the cap on the filter was tightly secured, but time and again I would get grounds in with my coffee. Plus, some of the water would run out the sides, meaning I had to hold the cup all the way up to the top of the dispenser, so I wouldn't get water all over my counter. This is a product you have to babysit, and for the money, you shouldn't have to do that. It does not work as well as the K-cups, and though they can be pricey, I will use only those in the future instead of this product, which I am now using as a drain catch in my sink. Lame."
3,Inconvenient,"What I expected of this item is that I could use it as easily as popping in a k-cup. Unfortunately, you have to take part of the insides of your keurig machine apart to use it and then put that part back if you want to use a k-cup. This seems like a terrible design to me. There are numerous other brands that offer a container that is so much easier. I like the ecobrew type, but there are others I haven't tried that might be just as good. I also see somebody sells a little cap, so that you can just reuse one of the containers from the ready-filled k-cups."
1,Look elsewhere,"This filter does not match up, or come even close to the quality of the disposable k cups. I tried a intractable design to make it work better...but again it failed.There are many other options available, I suggest checking them out over this one. One would think that the manufacturer of the machine would have the best shot at creating the best filter, but perhaps they are more interested in selling the disposable and pricey k-cups."
2,Disappointed:(,"My husband & I really Like our Kuerig however, we were disappointed in the reusable filter. The water goes through the grounds too fast, producing a very weak cup of coffee."
2,Quality of end result I.e.taste of coffee,"Once the filter packed and placed in the Kerig the result was not a good cup of coffee. I tried several different measurements, even grinding the beans to an espresso and still the taste was not their."
3,Wouldn't live without it... But it's not perfect,"Kcups are just too expensive. That's why I love this little filter. It solved all my coffee problems: don't have to brew a whole pot that I won't drink in a normal sized coffee maker, but don't have to spend outrageous amounts on kcups.But it needs some improvements. I don't know if the problem is the Keurig itself or the filter, but more often than not, it spurts coffee all over the place and spills onto the counter, missing the cup. I have to put napkins down to preemptively avoid the mess. When I do use kcups and the original needle piece that comes with the Keurig, there's never any such splash. Also, make sure you screw the top on as tightly as you can if you want to avoid a coffee cup full of grinds.I'd gladly replace this with a better model, but I haven't seen any compatible ones on the market, so in the meantime, this will do."
3,"It's nice, but takes effort to get it right","The reusable cup is nice, but it took some work to get it working right.When I first started using it, the water would just overflow out of the cup, taking coffee grounds with it into my mug. Nasty!After looking through the reviews here, I used a couple of techniques to get it working right. I cut down a used regular K-cup and stuffed it inside the reusable cup - between the mesh and the plastic meant a longer steep time for stronger coffee. I also pulled down the rubber O-ring on the puncture nozzle above the cup so that it would provide a better seal.Once all that was done, it works very nicely. I fill the mesh filter about 2/3 full and that's good enough for a large cup."
3,Makes a mild cup of coffee,"I wanted to use my favorite coffees in the Keurig coffee maker so this filter was just what I needed. However, even when I filled the grinds to the top level, I needed to use the smallest cup setting to get a good flavor. I think I will need to try a smaller grind setting and hope to get more taste and less waste."
3,Too Much Money,Item as a whole worked okay but too much money. I would purchase the filter part again to save time with cleaning but I do not need another plastic adapter to hold the filter.
2,K-Cup Reuable Filter,"Good idea but very, very messy to clean out after using the very convenient, mess-free K-Cups. But a good product and good to have on hand for when you run out of K-Cups or are awaiting an order of them to arrive."
2,Poorly designed,"I was excited to find a way to use my own coffee with my Keurig brewer and purchased a My K-Cup. The first time I used it, water sprayed all over and the coffee was weak, weak, weak. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I looked everything over, reviewed the directions and tried again. Same problem.Apparently, the gasket on the top needle doesn't seat into the My K-Cup device snugly enough to keep the water from washing out of the top hole, over the sides and out the bottom of the brewing spout -- it doesn't go through the coffee grounds and splatters everywhere.I have read that there is a ""fix"" by moving the gasket on the needle down or buying a gasket at a home repair store, but why should that be necessary? This is a brand new product that was DESIGNED (supposedly) to work with the same brand of coffee brewer. Keurig should redesign this device."
3,it's ok but there are better ways to do this,"This causes you to have to remove the basket which is tough if you want to keep using K-cups as well. Better to get the solofill cup, refillable which goes in as a k-cup does."
2,"Just the product, no box, no instructions, was ordered as new","Sold by-Anderson Leo, this comes as product only. I got it for my wife as a gift, after the ""what is it?"" from my wife It really would have made a better gift If it had the box and instructions. It is a bit annoying, I would have just go it at wallmart just to avoid the hassle.I feel like I over paid The should show just the Item like the other sellers. This seems like a seller issue."
2,Doesn't filter well,"I bought this for my kuerig machine hoping it would allow me to use my favorite coffee (Costco Columbian), but found that the coffee just didn't taste right when using this stainless filter. It was kind of gritty and had some coffee grinds in it. I ended up jamming a regular paper filter into this to try to make it work, but that was too much of a pain. I've seen some small paper filters for the kuerig and think I'm going to buy those instead."
4,a way to save money,practical and able to use own coffee. a real savings over the one time K-cups. easy to use and have preferred coffee as well
1,Good idea that does not work!,This is a waste of money and time if you want more in your cup than hot colored water. The water runs through it too fast to make coffee. I would have given it zero stars if I could have.
5,Awesome Product,"Product shipped quickly and as described. Definitely easier, and cheaper, than purchasing actual KCups! Sure, you don't get the variety in flavors, but it is great for that morning cup of coffee. I wanted to find the actual Keurig brand and this was just what I was looking for."
2,not a good design,"this is futile to use. you have to remove the original insert, then replace it with the re-usable unit. if someone else wants to use a K-Cup then you have to put the unit back together...ridiculous."
2,Disappointing Design,"This product could have been much better. To brew coffee, the Keurig brewers pressurize the K-cups. However this unit will not seal well enough between the lid and the body to allow this. As a result, water tends to leak out the side, resulting in weak coffee. The design should have used rubber or silicon seals for the lid and body.Another issue this product has is that you must remove the stock K-cup holder to use this. This means popping this in and out if you want to alternate between the K-cups and the reusable filter.I think there are some better alternative out there that do seal better. I am going to try the Ekobrew cup which does feature a seal."
1,Completely Disappointed!,Save your money! Your coffee grounds end up every where! They make a mess really difficult to clean up since the coffee grounds end up in the edges where you put the k-cups. Your cup of coffee also ends up full of coffee grounds! Not Good!
4,Economical one-cup alternative...,"...to the pod option, and I can make my coffee stronger this way. But it is a little hard to clean. Otherwise, great product."
1,Don't Buy it...,It's not worth a dollar... it just makes a huge mess in your kitchen and all over you nice coffee maker. Very disappointed!
1,Terrible Mess,"I love the xtra bold K-cups, but wanted this filter so I could use up all the coffee that's collected in my pantry - preground & beans. I ran out of K-cups so gave this a try. Experimented with different types of coffee, pre-ground -v- home ground beans, coarse -v- fine grains. In all cases I ended up with a mess. The water does not flow through the filter very well. I've tried different amounts of coffee in the filter and I still get grains backing up into the coffee maker itself. Then you gotta clean up coffee that gets splattered all over the counter. The small amount of coffee that actually makes it into my cup is very weak and not worth drinking. I'm throwing this filter away...not worth the hassle."
2,Not very useful,"This product takes some trouble to install-uninstall for use in the Keurig coffee maker, and still allows for making only one cup at a time. We decided it wasn't worth the trouble and returned it."
1,"Makes weak coffee, poorly designed","I was very excited to recieve the Keurig coffee maker with the idea that they have this great accessory that will allow you to avoid the cost of the pre-packaged K-cups and pick the coffee you want to brew. Well the thing does not work and I feel Keurig made it poorly on purpose so that you would need to purchase coffee packeged their way. While the fitting that comes with the brewer and holds the prepackaged K-cups snaps into place the My K-Cup accessory just sits there. The result: some brown coffee comes through but clear water also comes out in numerous flows into your cup, resulting in the weakest brew you will ever have. Needless to say I returned the accessory and the coffee maker."
3,Warning: Doesn't Fit Newest Keurig,"These K cups don't fit the newest, special edition Keurig. After I ordered these, I found the Solofill cup. They all came on the same day. The Solofill works great (for coffee and tea)."
3,LID WOULDN'T CLOSE,I GOT A KEURIG REUSABLE AND TOOK OUT THE PART THAT WAS IN PLACE FOR KCUPS TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN THE KEURIG REUSABLE. BUT WHEN I WENT TO PUT IN REUSABLE KEURIG THE TOP OF KEURIG WOULDN'T SHUT ALL THE WAY. COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS SO I ENDED UP JUST HOLDING IT WHILE IT BREWED - BUT IT WOULDN'T CLICK SHUT NO MATTER WHAT I DID - ANY IDEAS?
2,Convenient but cheaply constructed,"The reusable filter is a handy option and definitely saves money as compared with buying K-Cups. The major problem, though, as some other reviewers have noted, is the poor construction. We've only been using the filter for around two months, and we're already on our third one. That's ridiculous. No matter how gently you handle the filter, the plastic at the top of the outside container begins to crumble and fall off. Eventually, it makes it impossible to brew a cup of coffee without having grounds fall in and/or coffee spew out of the machine and all over the counter. What a pain in the neck."
2,My K-Cup and Keurig Mini B30,"I had problems with the My K Cup and Keruig Mini B30. When I attempted to use it with my own coffee, water leaked all down the front of the machine. The problem is that there isn't a good seal when the top is closed shut. It's almost like it needs to be a bit longer. I called Keurig and reported it. In the meantime, I found that wrapping a rubber band around the lip of the base helped create a good seal when the lid is closed. Now it doesn't leak, and I can use my own coffee, which is cheaper."
1,Does not fit in a regular Keurig Machine,"Does not fit in a regular Keurig Machine, it is too long and I can't close the top of it"
1,Watery nastiness,"Unfortunately, this filter holds only enough ground coffee for a small, 6oz cup and even then it's very weak and watery. Not worth buying at all."
1,BAD Design,"The K-cup filter #5048 to use your own ground coffee is a great idea, but Keurig created a poorly designed product.Look at the blogs about it and you will find a couple ""fixes"" that will enable you to use it successfully.My question is why isn't Keurig fixing this mistake? Why should their customers be offered a poor design that needs ""fixing"" to work properly? Come on Keurig, step-up and offer a fix or a newly designed filter. Seriously, treat your customers well and they will be faithful."
1,Leaks,Wanted this to work very bad with the price of the K-cups going up so much! It leaked every time I tried it!
2,A pain,"I tried the Keurig refillable filter for a month or so and did not like how it worked at all. You have to pop out the 'housing' on your machine to pop this filter in. It was messy and splattered quite a bit and it left grounds in my coffee.My sister sent me the Solofill reusable coffee filter for the Keurig and it works like a dream. You just pop it right it like a K-cup. So far-no splatters, easier to use, and no grounds in my coffee."
2,Weak Coffee,"I purchased this because K-Cups can get quite expensive, I like to try different kinds of coffee and I don't think they are very green.I've read mixed reviews on this item and most frequently the complaint was the coffee grains overflowing. I didn't have this problem at all. Everything worked nice and smooth with out any leakage or spillage. My problem is that the coffee is really weak. Even if I fill it to the top! I get a much better cup of coffee with the prefilled K-Cups. I went back to using the ones with out the plastic cup and just the filter bag on the bottom.I am really sad this didn't work because I really, REALLY wanted it to."
3,It's alright.,The filter does the trick but it overflows and leeks even though I'm not over filling it with coffee. The coffee tastes fine and it's cheaper than buying the prepackaged K-cup coffee. I may want to try a different design filter though.
3,The concept is great,"I like the idea of this product but disappointed once using it. I like to have this item as a back-up to my K-cups...if I run out of k-cups or only have decaf left, this product is a fine substitution. But, I won't use it on a regular basis because 1) I'm lazy and 2) It's just not that great of a product.PROS:1) Good back-up when k-cups are gone.2) If you have guests and don't want to waste a ton of k-cups...this works well using normal coffee.CONS:1) Water drips out of my Keurig just about every time I use this thing. I got it to not drip once but since there are no real markings on the My k-cup...I couldn't reinvent that scenario.2) More clean up of your brewer if you use these.3) Cleaning the filter every time instead of just throwing away the k-cups.So, if you are lazy like me and don't mind shelling out some dough for the k-cups...you won't use this product often. But, like I said, it's good to have as a back-up."
2,Short useful life makes it a loser,"This product does provide the means to use your own coffee to brew a cup, however, the plastic degrades very quickly and the tabs that hold the top to the bottom are the first thing to go. This makes the item unusable. I have purchased 3 of these in succession and have had the same problem all three times. Insanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different result...."
5,Great must have,"Works fine for the coffee I've tried but the real value of this for me is to use Tetley's British Blend tea bags from the grocery store. They are small round bags with no strings or labels. Two of those bags in this will make a nice strong cup of tea. I brew two 10 oz brews from my B40 with the same bags, add ice and I have an instant big glass of good ice tea."
1,Reuseable K-cup,This is a worthless piece of crap. I wasted nearly a 1/4 lb. of Kona coffee trying to get the grind right to use this thing. The design is extremely flawed. The standard K-Cup is punctured in the top and the bottom. The reuseable K-cup does not function as the ridiculously expensive K-Cups. I believe that Keurig did this intensionally to make money but to force the user to buy their K-Cups.I would not recommend this product to an enemy. If there was a way I could return this piece of crap I would. Stay away from this item unless you just want to wsste your expensive gourmet coffee.
3,Of little value,In many ways it defeats the purpose of the K-Cupconvenience and simplicity. I find it not very helpfull.Buy the K-Cups
3,K-Kup Reusable Filter,Used a few times with regular coffee and it works quite well...would recommend to anyone who has a favorite coffee they like that does not come in a K-Cup
2,Leaks,Seemed like good quality product but it leaks every time I use it. No matter what I try it still leaks. There must be some sort of defect or is not a true Keurig product. This rendering the product useless for me.
1,Great idea - Terrible product!,"Thank goodness I didn't buy the My K-Cup separately. It came as part of the combo pack with the Keurig that my in-laws gave me for Christmas. I was pretty excited about being able to use regular coffee grounds with my Keurig--I looked forward to having more variety, a backup if I ran out of K-Cups, and a cheaper alternative.Well, it has been nothing but a disappointment. There is no way to use this thing that water doesn't leak all around the sides and leave me with a very weak cup of coffee. I have tried all the tips from other reviewers about how to pack the filter with coffee, but none of them work.There is another similar product, the Solofill Cup, which gets much better reviews. I am going to try it...Don't waste your money on the My K-Cup!Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers"
4,My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,Item arrived ahead of schedule and was put to use immediately. It worked just fine and I expect to use it more in the future. I would recommend this to others seeking to save a little money.
1,Never received.,"I never received this, so I can't rate the product itself. All I can say is I wasn't happy with the outcome, I ordered, paid and never got it. I lost out on some money."
4,Works great!,I love this product. I don't personally drink coffee but my mother was wanting to use her old coffee maker since K-cups are a little pricey. Now she doesn't have to and she can make her coffee just like she likes it!
4,Great Cup of Coffee!,"The first time I tried using my own fresh ground coffee in this little filter I was really disappointed because it was very weak. Then I started reading the reviews here and thought I'd try the used empty K Cup idea. You take a used K-Cup and trim it down to fit in the bottom of the holder, then you put the mesh coffee filter in the K-Cup and fill with your own ground coffee. The fist time it dribbled a little and took forever to get a tiny amount of coffee to drink. Then I decided to take a used K-Cup and rotate it 4 times, each time closing the lid on the machine to poke a total of 4 wholes in the bottom of the K-Cup. I took this and trimmed it down and put it in the holder...added my mesh filter and added coffee. OMG....PERFECTION!!!! Now, I need to go buy a couple more of these little filters....this is so wonderful! I'm so happy because I can now enjoy my Starbucks again."
1,does not work,"this filter does not work at all ,it shoots water and makes coffee that is cloudy and gross and the little filter is hard to clean.i have talked to others who said the same thing.why would keurig want you to be able to use your coffee instead of their really expensive k cups.use your regular coffee maker for a pot of coffee,use the keurig for flavored."
1,"Don't waste your time, money and sanity...","I got this filter, along with the Keurig coffee maker as a gift. The coffee maker and K-cups are awesome! But this reusable filter is useless. It spewed water all over the place. I even tried all the Macgiver-like suggestions from other reviewers to make it work, but it just doesn't."
4,Good product for price.,"I had bought on when I got my Keurig. $19.99 in store. Took it back and purchased from Amazon for 1/2 price. It's kind of a pain to wash out every time, but it works like advertised and definitely is cheaper then buying K cups."
4,Good deal,Works good. I'm happy with it. Saves money and gets the job done. Not as good as the packets but good enough
1,Dissatified with the product and the responses. Coffee grinds in my coffee.,"Doesn't work properly, and the company Win Win(?) was not responsive to my specific question.They did respond to me twice, but the answers were not related to my question."
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I bought this because I felt wasteful using the cups in the machine at work, but also did not like the coffee used to fill the big carafe. This product sucks, though, and usually overflows and leaves my coffee mug a watery mess with grinds in it. I don't really recommend it, but I don't know of any alternatives that are worth purchasing."
1,not worth the momey,"got it because i like my brand of coffee, when i brewed first cup it was brown water.I like strong coffee don't spend your money."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,Do not buy this product. It is garbage. It does not work. The water overflows and doesn't pour properly. I continuously end up with coffee grinds in my cup. I tried an Internet suggestion of covering the basket with a piece of aluminum foil. Still didn't work. Still ended up with coffee grinds in my cup. This is a big waste of money.
1,One keurig product I will never buy again,I love my keurig. I own a mini and an elite. However this product is poorly designed and does no where near as good of a job making coffee as the regular k cups. It was a waste of $15 and I don't use it anymore...
2,Good Idea - Bad Design,"The only reason we bought the Keurig machine was because these reusable cups were available. Otherwise, the concept of individually packaged single use plastic containers is just environmentally irresponsible.These K-Cups are almost as disposable as the prepackaged coffee cups.The problem with them is that the screw flange around the top eventually breaks off. We've been through four already and are on our fifth. They are too brittle, and no amount of care or vigilance will prevent them from breaking.Keurig has been pretty good about replacing them, but don't seem to pass the info within the company up to R&D; to fix what must be a huge problem for them."
1,MIne doesn't work,"Tried this yesterday with some Folgers from a can. Coffee squirted out, water squirted out all over the place -- it was a mess. Made a half-decent cup of coffee (considering the coffee) but when I opened up the now-used My K-Cup half of the coffee was still dry. Sorry, it's a nice idea but it doean't work."
2,"As ususal, the original is best and we're not talking Reusable as the original.","Thought we'd save money by buying this product and you do. But there is a cost to your sanity and taste buds. As you've probably read you must not overfill this gadget. How will you know just the right amount? Because it will be all over the place, you'll waste grounds, and you'll add a few minutes of cleanup to your day until you get it right. The other HUGH thing is flavor! We're not sure why, but when you use a K-Cup the flavor is better folks, just better, with no residue on the bottom of the cup. Believe me if you don't know what we mean by residue, you will because you'll see it. We read the reviews and followed the suggestions, ie, used a stronger flavor coffee to begin with and even reground the beans but the flavor is not there. And we don't think there is anyway at all to get rid of the mung at the bottom of the cup unless the manufacturer redoes the material used to make it."
2,Hard to get in & out of machine!,"Was very excited to get this Keurig accessory and brew own coffee. Unfortunately, it's rather tricky to get this filter in and out of my Keurig machine. Very tight fit, and worried about breaking something! It's not nearly as wonderfully intuitive a product as the Keurig itself. Very disappointing."
3,Usuable,I ordered this product because it was cheaper than buying it locally. Later I saw an ad on TV where I could save even more money and get 4 instead of 1.
5,Love this!,"I had been thinking about ordering this for my Keurig for awhile, but didn't sit down to do it until I saw the Limited Edition Godiva Pumpkin Spice coffee- and it wasn't available in a K-Cup. I bought the coffee and came home and ordered this- it got to my house in a matter of two days and has been a beloved possession ever since."
5,Great Price,You can't beat the price...amazon is much cheaper than any local retailer I can shop at. Love being able to drink any coffee I want...and it's cheaper than buying k-cups all the time.
1,Not for Keurig OfficePro,"This does not fit the Keurig B145 OfficePro, but lists this nowhere on the box or in the description of the item."
1,Makes very weak coffee,"My K Cup does not work. The water runs straight through in a single stream & barely flavors the water.I tried using the bottom of a K Cup as shown on other websites, it didn't help. I also tried grinding the coffee to a finer grind, it helped only slightly. My coffee is still nothing but water.I am very disappointed Keurig would sell something that does not work at all. This lowers their reputation in my opinion."
3,Keurig My K Cup,Lid to my Keurig will not close with the lid to the K cup on. I have to put a peice of foil over cup and then close the top Keurig
2,Great idea but ....,"This reusable filter is a great idea to save money (buying all those prepackaged coffee K cups) and to eliminate a lot of trash. Ok it's sort of a pain to clean out the grounds from the screen, but certainly do-able. BUT the plastic rim breaks off after limited use. PLEASE make a better quality, longer lasting item!"
5,Kuerig My K-Cup,Love it. I have been able to save money by using my own coffee rather than purchasing K-cups. So easy to use and clean up is a breeze.
2,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee filter,Purchased the Keurig Model because it had the option of using these Reusable Coffee Filters but the reusable filters are made of cheap thin plastic which frequently breaks especially when twisted to contain the coffee...The one ordered from Amazon had to be returned because it came damaged..broken pieces of plastic before it was ever used...Keurig should redesign this optional piece or simply stick with the original Keurig one time coffee K-cups.
4,Mini coffee filter,"The Keurig filter is certainly a great money saver! The K-cups with coffee are very handy and tidy, but the cost is a little more than buying coffee the old fashion way. The filter allows you to buy regular coffee and be able to use it in the single brew Keurig coffee machine.It tends to be not as ""tidy"" as the K-cups but allows you to use regular coffee.I really like the filter and do use both filter & K-cups,which can be switched back and forth with ease."
1,K-Cup Reusable Filter NOT Good!,"In 11 months I am on my third K-Cup reusable filter. The outer shell that holds the filter basket is made from a cheap, brittle plastic that is designed to fail because it is an inappropriate material for this device. When the flanges on the the first once cracked off, I attributed it to my heavy-handedness. I bought a second, and was exceedingly careful. When the edge of the top cracked off despite gentle handling, I called Keurig customer service to complain and let them know that the filter shells were too brittle. They were very nice, but attempted to chide me for not being careful with it! They sent me a free replacement. When the top of THAT filter body cracked after one month I gave up. (It will just take three more filter replacements until the cost of my B-40 has been reached.) I tried Krazy Gluing the top back together and it sort of works. I won't buy another filter until they start using a material that is more suited for this purpose."
3,They now come in pre-opened boxes! :(,I bought this as a gift and the filter came like someone else already had opened it. WTF?! When I bought this it said new.
2,Great Product...For About A Month!,"I used to own the Keurig B40, and I thought this product would be great because I could use my own coffee and wouldn't have to buy the K-Cups. At first, I loved it, it worked great, and the coffee came out great. After using it a few times, however, I began to notice grinds in my coffee. At first, it wasn't so bad, I could pick them out, no big deal. But after about a month of having it, it got so bad, I couldn't drink the coffee because there were so many grinds in it. Please think twice before buying this!"
2,Poor design,"I still cannot manage to make a cup of coffee that both tastes good and doesn't end up with all of the grounds at the bottom of the cup. I shouldn't have to create a hack from used K-cups just to make this work. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. I don't know how the other similar products work, but I would definitely try one of those before this. It's frustrating!"
1,Makes weak coffee,"Nice idea, but the design of this is just awful. The hot water shoots straight thru the middle of the filter and barely hits any of the coffee grinds. They should've made this filter system just like the kcups (one hole at the top and one hole at the bottom). The coffee is very weak."
1,Don't Buy This Item,"This is a poor-fitting filter that, when used, leaked heavily and spewed coffee grounds over the brewer and our counter-top. Don't waste your money."
1,Useless,"I purchased 2 of these products and both were no good. the material they are made of chips off in small pieces, until the product begins to leak coffee all over the place. I feel this a manufacturing problem which the company needs to correct. With the price being what it is I cannot feel justified in buying another. I have stored the coffee maker. I cannot use it."
2,Great idea....poor operation,"I was really looking forward to this as we go through a ton of K cups at work but these are quite messy to work with. They get grinds in the coffee and all over the Keurig. Wish they worked better, I think there is another one that is red which may work better too."
4,economical,Although I love that it saves money it has to be cleaned after each use. I love being able to throw away the k-cups.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I absolutely LOVE my new Keurig coffee maker, and was super excited to try this product. What I ended up with was a big mess! The thing overflowed and water and coffee grounds got everywhere. I am so disappointed :( I am going to try something else. What a shame to have wasted the money. I do not recommend this product."
5,Keurig is the best,"I love my Keurig coffee machine, and the re-useable filter has come in handy for using up my old tea bags and coffee grounds. I rarely ever made coffee at home, because it is just me. Now I can have coffee, tea or hot chocolate without having to pull out my big coffee pot or tea pot."
5,k-cup,"worked great,,excellent price,arrived very fast,,if interested in using your own brand of coffe in your new keurig,,this is what you will need and it works great"
5,Great price,"I like to use my own brand of coffee sometimes. Plus, it is cheaper than buying the K-Cups all the time. I do not drink a lot of coffee, so I tend to use the K-cups most of the time, but this is a nice alternative when you just want a cup of good old-fashioned coffee. :) It was a great price!"
2,Eh.,The pads were much smaller than advertised (15x22 perhaps) and they are not very absorbent AT ALL. The product got two stars due to how cheap it is... but the product definitely reflects the price.
2,potty pads,"There were not absorbent enough for a dog. They won't be absorbent for a puppy. I had to use twice as many as normal and was not happy w/ the results. The pad leaks and if you don't put two or three pads on top of each other, the floor gets wet."
1,Too thin,"These pads are too thin and don't absorb. Great price but I had to order new ones after 1 week of use with these, because they just aren't adequate."
1,Don't waste your money,"Pure Chinese made junk ,a paper towel has more absorbency than these pads . hold them up to the light,little or no absorbant material ,"
2,Cheaper because they're much thinner,"They are much cheaper because they are super thin. The ones from other brands, or even just Petsmart cost about twice as much, but are about 3x as thick. You can see through the padding to the plastic on these. If you have a puppy toy dog they may be fine, but for normal sized dogs they'll overflow it much too quickly."
3,Poop Pads,"I have two senior cats, one of which gets confused when in the litter. Its a covered box and Groucho goes in but neglects to turn around leaving his butt hanging out of the opening. I started using the pads because I knew that this was an ongoing problem that is not going away. The pads are just enough to absorb his mistakes. I think for a small animal they are fine, but they do rip easily. Its an inexpensive way to keep the litter area clean since I change the pad sometimes twice a day. It gets the job done."
4,Great Little Dr.'s Kit,"I bought this for my nephew for his 3rd birthday. He loves it! He wants everyone to have an ""appointment"" so he can practice with this kit."
1,Lots of Parts,"But nothing really works, not even the stethoscope which would be the easiest thing to work, right? It's disappointing. I wouldn't buy it. It's not worth the money."
5,Doctor Sohn,My daughter loved it! It has everything. She plays with it all of the time. I was not expecting to hear a heartbeat when I put the stethoscope up to my ears. That was great!
3,"Not most Durable, but fun for now",I like how this kit contains lots of items that my almost 3-year old daughter can use. However the case itself doesn't close properly for us - one of the locks does not lock which makes cleaning up very frustrating as the items are constantly falling out of the case.
5,Xmas gift,My son loves this! It is worth every penny! It was a Christmas gift and I think I may purchase for other little boys his age! Shipping was fast and service great. Thank you again.
2,Disappointed,"Bought this for my daughter (2+) and although she enjoys playing with it I am disappointed with it in compairson to other kits. Front clasp on case fell off after first day and although it snaps back on it doesn't stay shut anymore. Also, didn't realize at time of purchase but the stethoscope is just an electronic noise maker. Other kits include a ""real"" one that actually works and lets you hear a hearbeat. Blood pressure cuff also needs to be larger."
1,Broken phone and stethoscope,"This toy set looks pretty good, but the quality control is very bad. The phone and stethoscope do not work in the kit I got for my kids. I tried new batteries, but no luck! After reading the reviews, I guess we are not the only ones with these broken toys. Kids have already opened the items, so I am not sure we can send them back."
3,BIRTHDAY PRESENT,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY GRANDSON AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. THE BLOOD PRESSURE BALL DIDN'T HOLD UP AND CRACKED A FEW DAYS AFTER HE HAD IT. IT SEEMS TO BE OK OTHER THAN THAT.
2,"Very cheap toy, regret buying","I got this for my daughter for Christmas based on all the reviews. I wish I would have bought another set. 1. the blood pressure cuff broke day one. 2. there are so many parts to it I wish they would have made fewer ones but better quality, everything feels very cheap. 3. my daughter pinched her finger on the case. it is not the easiest to open. My daughter is almost 4 so it cant be that she is too young. I should have bought another kit."
2,Great tools but cheaply made - 2 broken on 1st use...,"I am so disappointed. This kit looks amazing and I love all the great tools. Unfortunately, the stethescope arrived broken, the blood pressure tool band is so small it only fits the wrist and tore upon first use. After taping it back together I realized the pump that makes the dial move doesn't work...you press it and it just stays smooshed rather than filling back up with air. The glasses are adorable but too short to even reach my 3 year old's ears so she can't wear them. The case has buckles on it that are seemingly child-proof. Would have been a great Dr.'s kit if they had cared about the quality. Sending it back."
4,Made a 6 1/2 year old happy,"My daughter really enjoyed this set and set to work immediately with the included glasses perched on her nose and brandishing a stethoscope. The quality of the pieces is decent with batteries included (surprisingly) in the beeper and the stethoscope. The blood pressure gauge spins when the bulb is squeezed and the cuff is sized right for a small bicep. The stethoscope makes coughing sounds when pressed and the beeper beeps with an emergency light displaying. There is a syringe whose plunger works but in a safe fashion and then a couple of surgical tools. This toy is more than adequate for a safe medical make believe between little friends and has enough variety of items to sustain an extended role play. The box that contains everything is pretty sturdy and has solid catches to keep it closed. At the current price point of $18+, it is a reasonable buy."
3,Not The Best,"I purchased this item for my 6yr old son who recently informed me that he has aspirations to become a doctor. Upon arrival I noticed that the set wasn't exactly what I expected. But I figured eh it's a inexpensive childs toy so I kept it. On Christmas when my son opened it I was less than pleased to find out that the cell phone that takes two AA batteries is defective and doesn't work!What a shame, a brand new toy that doesn't even work! And how can I handle the situation, I can't take it from my son to return it because SANTA has given it to him not Amazon.When I make a brand new item purchase I expect it to be in perfect working order!What a big let down for my son on Christmas day"
4,good wholesome fun,"My son received these ice cream cones from ""santa"" at his day care and the toy was a hit with all the toddlers in his class! There are two cone bases so a friend can share in the fun. The ice cream scoops are colorful and sturdy and stay on the cone nicely; my only complaint is that when stacking several scoops on top of one another they don't always stick well and will fall off when carried around. This however is good for make believe play as well. :) Overall this is a great toy that does not require batteries (always a plus) and promotes interactive pretend play, as well as color ID, for the toddler and young child set. Another note: my scoops arrived solid colored, not speckled with white like the picture."
5,These are just what I was looking for,"I saw these at a library play center across the country and wrote a description in my notes so I could find them again. I ran across this at Christmas time, and searched amazon. When they arrived I was so pleased to see that they were just what I wanted. I then bought five sets, I liked them better than the wooden ones I saw - the texture is just right."
5,Great Toy,"Both my kids (ages 2 and 5) love this toy, as do their friends who come over to play. It is durable and easy for them to stack and pretend with and learn their colors."
5,"Simple idea, tons of fun and imagination","My 2 1/2 year old daughter played with these cones at a local fun spot.I knew immediatley that I would have to purchase these for her. They are so durable and fun. She played with just that for over an hour, stacking the ice cream, playing ice cream shop and serving, it was endless. She didn't want anyone else there to even touch it! Such a simple toy with tons of fun and possibilities. Great toy!"
5,"A ""Must Have""","Really great sound... maybe the best Jerry Lee Lewis recordings... His piano performance is better than ever, so if you are a fan or just like oldie music, this is a ""must have"""
2,Not quite great...,"I could see where the script was probably a lot better than the application. Great ideas (the return of Dracula, the addition of two-more vampire hunters - the very attractive Jessica Biel and the very funny Ryan Reynolds, and the end of Blade's world as he knows it) met average directing and poor performances by the main evil character (Dominic Purcell).If the Dracula character had been played by an actor with some depth we could have seen a more poignant and intense movie (Dracula, a creature of ancient customs feeling out of time in the modern world).Instead we get a movie that has pretty good action scenes with its most redeeming concept being a spin-off of the two characters played by Biel and Reynolds. I hope that happens!"
5,Blade trinity,I love this movie I love the unrated version you get more than the regular movie and I love that. I just love it that's all I have to say about that!!!
1,"In one word. ""Horrible""",This movie is horrible. I almost got up and left. The franchise has jumped the shark. How could they go from the great high of Blade I to this?I'm only giving it one star because I liked watching Jennifer Biel.
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! 2 1/2 STARS,"Once again,they blow it. The first Blade was great! The second and third are just OK. They are better than some other Marvel Comics movies,but they are no where near as good as the first film."
1,top ten things i didnt like about this movie,"10. nothing new here that the first two films didnt do better.9. the last time i saw that much Apple product placement, i was in my local Mac store8. ryan reynolds' one liners were completely and utterly unfunny7. the soundtrack sounds like it came right from a 13 year olds' ipod. which it probably did.6. i didnt quite understand how superhumanly strong vampires can beat on a chained up human for fifteen minutes and he ends up getting up and kicking their asses.5. they should have called the movie Blade 3: Blade's Friends.4. the special effects were neither special nor effective3. wesley snipes phones his part in. his acting is so crusty!2. all the characters were a mess. by the end of the film i was hoping everyone was going to die.1. Dracula looked like the lead singer from Creed."
2,Lame Vampire Movie,"What I kept thinking as I was watching Blade Trinity was: ""Oh, wait... they want us to take this seriously."" The plot, such as it was, was completely overshadowed by loud music and neato whiz-bang special effects.If you want to see Jessica Biel (as, no joke, Whistler's Daughter) looking fierce in tight clothes, maybe this is the movie for you. If you are a fan of the incredible Ryan Reynolds, he is his usual funny self, but has woefully too little screen time. As for the rest of the cast; Wesley Snipes rarely utters a word, Parker Posey does her usual scheming bitch, and Kris Kristofferson returns again. (Wait a minute - Didn't he die in movies number one AND two?) Not bad enough to walk out of, but not good enough to ever see again."
4,Slice n Dice,"Ahhhhhhh mindless action. Is there anything better? Well... how about action mixed in with a good story? Now we're talking!! The thing with Blade that drew me in so well, was it was a very well put together action movie, but it also had a not too bad story-line. Granted, it's not Good Will Hunting story calliber, but it's ok none the less. I'll have to say this 3rd attempt was a lot better than the 2nd Blade. I did find our evil lord Dracula was dressed somewhat silly though. He looked like an out of time rocker ... lol. Jessica Beil was very cool. Though her ties to Whisler were confusing... but whatever. Ryan Renolds (ya canada!) brought some much wanted humor and resolve to us. All in all, it's a good rent ... or buy to complete your Blade collection. Cheers!"
4,Yeah!,"2nd best of the trilogy. In this case 1st is #. Good action, plot. Director seemed to force Ryan a bunch of 1 liners, he would have been kick ass as the quiet deadly one."
2,"Naw, not what I expected","OK saw this and was very disappointed, it tried to hard to be something it is not, entertaining 1/2 of the time, Jessica beil is a second rate answer to Jennifer Gardner as Electra lets hope thats better, Reynolds characters over acting left me flat the jokes are trying to hard. The villian base could have been outstanding Parker Posie is cast correctly but underused and whats with the hair!?, I bought the other two but will pass on this when it comes to DVD, very disappointing indeed. Of course the effects are great. I always liked the way the vamps get vanquished and they do alot of that here."
1,Ugly is as ugly does.,"I *have* read this book, and it is nothing more than anti-Mormon propaganda written in a condescending style in an attempt to attract young people who can't see the ugliness for what it is.If you don't like Mormons and if you want to read something that will justify your own beliefs and if you don't mind the pain of watching an adult try to speak as he thinks a teenager would, this is the book for you.Everyone else should stay away."
3,Average,"Not that many people will see this, as these are somewhat discontinued. When I bought my Olympus PearlCorder S912, a Panasonic MC60 tape came with it. I was pleased with the quality of results I was getting (I'm a musician and I do demos on these things) and it actually had a harmonic quality that emphasized my voice and the good musical harmonics in the songs. I bought some of these Gold TDKs to have spares, and though the average ear probably couldn't tell one mite of a difference, I noticed that the harmonic quality is not as good on these and actually makes my bad notes stand out more (I'm a less than perfect singer, and don't especially care when getting ideas down to tape). The sound is more metallic and shrill. Never thought there'd be a difference in tape quality between brands!The Panasonic leaves me feeling good about the captured demos, the TDK makes me want to re-record to get a better sounding demo. I guess I don't like these and will be buying the Panasonic ones instead."
5,Perfect for sending a signal to your hdtv with a pc input!,"I bought this wire because I wanted to view my pc on my TV. I cancelled my cable, and watch Netflix through my 360, and other shows like Survivor right through websites, and didnt want to keep switching the wires in the back of the pc, (I still use my moniter also) so I bought this. It works perfectly."
3,VGA splitter cable,This product works wonderful for what I wanted. Although I had to reset my computer for the second monitor to work properly. Once the computer reset was done I was very happy with the performance of the Y-cable.
4,Works...but...,"I ordered the Tripp Lite Y splitter....it works, but....it isnt actually a ""Y"" splitter..the two split ends are actually attached, and the quality of the picture got darker on both screens. I bought this item for a client of mine. Hooked it up to a desktop computer and his 32"" sony bravia tv. The picture quality on the monitor stayed good but just got dimmer/darker. As for the tv, well the picture was slightly off and was much darker than the lcd monitor. otherwise the product does do okay.I would suggest that if you are going to use this product, that you have it split between to monitors that are the exact same."
4,Lots Of Fun,It was a smaller basket than we were expecting but our Granddaughter loves playing with the basket and plastic food.
5,My most used PHP book,"Of all the PHP books I have, this is the one I reach for first when I'm trying to remember how a particular function or technique works. It is well written, gets straight to the point, and offers easy to understand examples. If you only have one PHP book, this should be it. I find it faster, more informative, and easier to use than searching the web for simple everyday questions."
4,Nice story,"It was good. It was about Pam's pony getting sick and no one knows why. I think the author did a very good job, it was quite a good reason. The pony pals did a good job figuring it out. It was a good example, and if anyone is ever in the same situation, do what they did in this book. The plot was good and interesting. Read this book if you like ponies!!"
4,Slow But Still Good,"I am now on book 5 of the Wheel of Time series, and I am beginning to see a repetition. BUT, the book still has awesome chapters and interesting characters. I gave it four stars because I don't think its as good as The Great Hunt or The Dragon Reborn."
5,Keep reading!!!,Once again the story spins out and keeps you so engrossed you can't put it down! Must read this one.
5,Best of the whole series,"I absolutely loved this book. It's my favorite of the whole series. Perrin is my favorite character, so the fact that this is largely his story somewhat influences my opinion, but overall, the whole book is excellent. Superb writing, wonderful character development, and a quick-paced plot. ""The Shadow Rising"" is the Hope diamond of this jewel of a book series."
2,....What....what happened,"Good Evening... oh wait, it's nine in the morning, how odd. I enjoyed immensly the first two Wheel of Time books finding them to be highly entertaining. The third became a little dull in the middle however recovered itself before the end. Two hundred pages into book four however led me to realise that Robert Jordon was an insane lunatic who apparantly had no concept of the word ""brief"". Make no mistakes i am a fan of fantasy in its better forms such as ""The Lord od the Rings"" and the like, however Robert Jordan seems to be paid by the word. The story spirals into a mess which by all accounts is going to take another eight books to complete. I found myself contemplating the ending after fifty pages such is the predictibility of this book.I am by no means discouraging others from reading the book. I can easily see it's appeal to a wide audience, however it did nothing for me or my dog...wait...oh dear. Robert Jordan claims another victim to his sickness."
5,Another Great Chapter of a Huge Saga,"It has been a while since I didn't read something so well written, not since the original Dune series by Frank Herbert and Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. The complexity of these novels is astounding; its characters and their world seem so real. I recommend Wheel of Time as the greatest fantasy series of all time. TSR is better than TDR and the scenes describing the Aiel story and the Emmond's Field Battle are the best of the saga so far."
5,The words are spell-bindingly woven,"The best book I've read so far in the WOT-series. There were some quite complicated moments, but they all made sense after some logical thoughts. Robert Jordan is just an enormously clever author.There surely is some new character development in this book. I got the chance to get further into Perrin's personality. I love the the new sides of Faile's which was presented in this book too. I've fell in love with her. Also I got the chance, for almost the first time, to get into Moiraine's mind.I hope that I'm not the only one who has got the chance to do all that. I know I'm not the only one. So all of you other Jordan fans: Get finished with Dragon Reborn and read this!Some serious plot-twists awaits too. What happened in the ending must have been one of the most surpring moments in any of the WOT-books. As an ending to my review: Take some time off and give yourself the joy of reading this, the fourth instalment of the WOT-series. Have a good time!"
5,No spoilers included,"The fourth is the best book in the series so far. Character development is at an all time high. Each main character is given several consecutive chapters that reveal the history of their world, demonstrate the type of person each character is, and drive the narrative forward. Very fun read."
5,Delightful book,"I was lucky enough to have found this book in it's 5th printing and signed by the artist.The artist/author is famous for her photographs & writing, and adds to her 40 plus publications this wonderful collection of full page illustrations. The drawings were created in 1983 as visual notations of the writers group she attended.The drawings are simply lovely and a wonderful way to start a lazy day by enjoying page after page.The book's last page is a brief afterward by the artist where she explains ""Drawing is, for me, a way of knowing the world.""If you enjoy this book you also want to find these titles by Tee Corinne -A first book of landscape drawings (2001)Drawing Close to Home (2004)Drawing as a problem solving activity (2002)Grasses, Weeds and Flowers; drawings & a few suggestions about making images in pen & ink (2005)People Places and things: drawings 1997Self-portrait (1991) drawings and essaysSofties; drawings (1991)Visiting the yarrow (1993)Woodstoves: Drawings (2001)"
5,Nice overview,I found it a great journey as the student from whom find themselves curious about the field and pleased in the patients shown by the author.
4,good battery,purchase experience was very good. Delivery was fast and product exactly what I ordered.
2,Not so much.,"I really dislike most of these packs. I have gone through several sets and even went with another brand once. None of them have the life span that the manufacture claims. It is one of those, if you need them, kind of things. In other words, if you need it for your radio get it, it not leave them alone."
3,Magnetic ABC's,"My 3 year old son loves these letters. They are all over the fridge and all over his easil and unfortunately, all over the floor most of the time. I do like how many you get for the money and the container they come in for storage. I like the fact that the backside of the letter is a magnet and there is no chance of my son swallowing anything that will harm him. I don't know if we received an odd batch or what, but when we went to spell a word that had 3 a's in it we could only find 2 a's in the whole bunch, so spelling longer words or even short sentences is tough."
1,The Worst Edition Possible,"The New Page edition of this book is a true piece of cr*p! Every single page has multiple typographical errors, obviously deriving from shoddy proofreading of the text they scanned. I thought I could deal with it, but it reached the point where it was distracting, so I ordered the Dover edition instead. I was an idiot not to get that one in the first place. Don't repeat my mistake!"
5,Fairy-Faith Forever,"while Evans-Wentz...dear lovers of Faerie,... is best noted for his many books on Tibetan Buddhism, this was his first and our favorite work. If you love Faery Lore, Mythology, the Celtic Peoples, Magic, History, the Sidhe, etc. you'll love this compendium of legends and lore of the Fair Folk. It is a glimpse into the not so distant past of the remnants of Celtic belief and is valuable in so many ways.kyela,the silver elves[...]"
2,Very Disappointed,"My sons teacher has a cookie jar that looked JUST like this one, except it counted each cookie out load as you put it in the jar. Since this cookie jar is identical to the one his teacher has I bought it thinking it was the same one. But no, this is just a cookie jar with cookies in it, no electronic counting. We were very disappointed when we opened it and realized it was not what we expected."
4,My 10 mth old loves this toy!,I bought these cookies for my daughter who is 2.5 to try to teach her to count. Ends up that my 10 mth old son plays with it everyday. He likes to shake the cookies out of the jar.
2,Not so good,I was not impressed with this book. It is simply not that good. I ended up getting a book from Office Max for daily entries instead.
4,A Fine Farewell,"This is a lovely album by the now extant Beulah. ""Yoko"" serves as both a testement to the band members failed personal relationships, and the bands own untimely demise. As such, ""Yoko"" is a darker listen then previous albums like ""The Coast is Never Clear"" and ""When Your Heartstrings Break,"" but it still maintains the California colored indie pop sound that the band became known for while under the Elephant 6 umbrella. The album furthers the band musically, while still maintaining the lyricism of their past works. ""Don't Forget to Breathe,"" ""Your Mother Loves you Son,"" and ""Me and Jesus Don't Talk Anymore"" are highlights. This band consistantly created pop gems, and ""Yoko"" is no exception."
5,Perfect fit,"While the plastic coloration is slightly different than what was in the 2004 Sentra, it is hardly noticeable. Other than that this is a perfect fit and I now have an aftermarket radio working perfectly where the stock radio used to be."
3,Where were the killer whales?!,"I bought this DVD for my toddler since he loves whales. He loves Free Willy and Disney Nature Earth footage on humpback whales but he did not enjoy this dvd, I think because there were no killer whales in it. I assumed there would be since the front cover has one. Also not a lot of footage on dolphins. Just not what we expected but I guess it can be very educational."
3,Only so-so,"I really, really like ""Short Sharp Shocked"" and ""Texas Campfire Tapes"". ""Captain Swing"" has too much instrumentation, too much orchestration. The raw, simple truths in her other albums are not so accessible here, buried in the production. She moved from the small stage to the arena, and we miss her proximity. You may still like the album--it is not awful--just don't expect it to be like these other two albums."
5,Sickening reviews,"I'm an operalover and have enjoyed this art for about 50 years now. I was so lucky as to catch Madame Callas live for several concerts and a lovely performance of La Sonnambula. She was great and kind every time I heard her. While I'm not a great fan of the studio-Aida this performance (Released in even better sound on EMI, also available on Amazon) totally convinced me. She was in amazing form and luckily the wobble of her latter years is not yet present. She sounds passionate and wild, like a proud princess in love. Her ""O patria mia"" is just lovely and the E-flat is thrilling. Del Monaco still sounded solid and golden in those years, that huge column of sound! When I heard him live he gave me chills! Taddei is a luxury casting for Amonasro, his ""Non sei mia figlia!"" has to be heard to be believed. This is a great performance, even the most severe critics aknowledge its greatness. Trust them and enjoy a blazing performance!"
2,Poor sound. Lackluster Callas.,"The sound quality of this recording is poor. The female voices in particular are distorted and hard to listen to because of their grating quality. The males do much better. Given the low price, this recording is probably worth having for historical interest."
3,Plastic,"I agree that it is disappointing for this thing to be plastic... would it cost that much more to make it out of metal? Anyway, there's no point arguing since this is the only option... how else can you connect your Hansgrohe shower? It looks fine and works fine, I just hope I don't need to mess with it because it's brittle."
3,Made of Plastic!?!!,"I bought this to go with the hand shower. For the price, it should be made of metal - it is plastic! - 2 stars.Looks good, although don't know how long this will last.I did also get the brushed nickel hose connector. If you've invested in Hansgrohe fixtures, the hose is definitely worth it. It looks great with all of the other brushed nickel hardware."
1,Ouch,"Wow. I had high hopes for tbis, but it is mediocre at best and unlistenable in a couple of places."
5,Very good - enjoyed the surprising plot twist 1/3 of the way,"I enjoyed this book as I have the others of MB's books I've read. Once the scene moved to London I was hooked. I usually have a hard time getting into her books, but once I'm in it's hard to quit! Her main characters are so real. I'm anxious to read more."
2,A 13 year old's P.O.V.,This book didn't keep my interest. The beginnning was good but once I hit page 220 I lost interest. I didn't care what happened to the characters. It was a little to dramatic. Soap operaish. But I guess since I'm 13 that's why I don't like this book.
2,Disappointment!,"I enjoyed this book until the ending, when Maeve Binchy became tired of writing and decided to end her story in a few dismal pages that didn't do her character development justice. Do not waste your time with this book! If you're reading the reviews (as I did) to find out if anyone else had been disappointed, you're not alone. This will teach me to read the reviews first . . ."
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"I really do not like giving this book even one star. I did not care at all for the subject matter, the author's writing style nor the length. The overall tone of the book was too depressing for me. I found nothing redeeming in this work and I am perplexed at how anyone can feel favorable toward it."
4,Great Story for my Three Miles a Day,Maeve wrote a great story. The plot moved quickly. The characters were excellent. Was a great tape to listen to while I walked or drove in the car! Sort of brought me back to the old radio soap operas of many years ago!
5,A wonderfull story!,"I have read ""the Glass lake"" by Maeve Binchy 3 times, and every time i have been angry that the book isen't longer. (around 600pages though:-)The book is about Kit, who lives in ireland in the fihties. When she is twelwe her mom disaperes and everyone thinks she has comitted suicide. but has she?.... The book tell us how Kit growes up, fall in love, goes to school and write with her moms mystrius friend from London.The book also tells us the story of a women who left her family for her old lover, and now has to live with the fact that everyone thinks she is dead....I love this book because, it is exiting, funny, romantic, clever and full of details and suprises. Kit is a wonderful strong heorine.You must read it! i also think it's the best of Maeve Binchy's books, and i have read almost all of them..:)"
5,CAPTIVATING!,"A beautiful story, and also full of suspense at the same time. Really transfer me to another world.Well done!"
4,Look out...,"This man could be come a big time mover and shaker. He reminds me of a cross between Ice Cube, and Coolio. One of the most solid debut albums i've ever seen, id say give the man all the awards he should get, but i don't want him to leave the studio that long..."
4,The good Eminem protege,"I think 50 Cent is the most overrated person in music history. His songs are terrible and he can't rap at all. Obie Trice, however, can. I've been waiting for Obie's CD since I heard him rap on ""Drips"" on Eminem's last CD. This CD has good beats and good raps. While it's far from perfect, it's a great debut for a rapper with a very bright future. Favorite songs are Lady, Hits the Fan, Don't Come Down, and Bad *****."
3,It was an OK first album...,...but with all the hpye i expected a little better. I'm not saying you shouldnt buy it but I think you should hear it first before you do cause it may dissapoint.
4,Obie Trice - Real Name No Gimmicks,This is a good cd with a couple outstanding guest appearances by his partner the 1 n only Eminem
2,Banking off Eminem's name,"The golden ticket giveaway from Shady Records should have been a dead give away. This C.D. is not as lame as D12's ""Devil's Night"" because it does have a few good songs. It's evident that Obie is more skilled than alot of people give him credit for lyrically but, he treads on familiar ground throughout the album. If every song seems familiar it's because they are. Beats from Dre or Eminem with carnival-sounding hooks, mediocre Ja Rule disses, somewhat believable gangsta-themed songs and featured guests including Fiddy, Nate Dogg on the hook and Em again. I think that Obie would have been better to get some creative freedom outside of Aftermath for this C.D. My suggestion is to pass on this album but, wait for Obie's next project and hope he can get away from Shady's shadow."
4,It's Hot!!!!!,"1st off, I have to say that this is pretty hot for his 1st album. People say he's gttin all the hype because he signed with Em. If u hot u hot, it don't matter that he's signed with Em. Why wouldn't you want to be down with 1 one the hottest artist out there? (Why play with Barkley and the Suns when u could win with Jordan and the Bulls?)Shady/Aftermath has the game on lock. People had it out for Obie even before his album dropped. They try to compare him to Em and say he's wack like D-12. Obie has his own style. His flow is sick. He spittin that DETROIT FIRE. CHEERS to all tha haters.!!"
3,Being Real,Obie Trice really isn't the best of the bunch. The only reason it was even looked as was because of who? You guest it Eminem and maybe 50 cent and g Unit. But really just Eminem the man that everyone that would have his a$$ kissed by millions for a penny. The song that he did make that I like had other people fetured on it. So no Obie you could have done better homie.
5,Must Buy,"Some may not like Obie's unqiue style and flow, but it's hard to deny he has skill. Backed by the biggest producers, Dre, Timbaland & Eminem, this is an ultimate package of outstanding beats with great word play by Obie. First 50,000 copies might contain a ""Golden Ticket"" which will send you to watch Eminem work at the studio :) So buy this!"
4,Buy it....,"This is a good CD. Regardless of the fact that he's involved with the most POP-ular clique in Hip Hop, there's a lot more to his style portrayed in this cd than ""eminem and dre's production"" and ""50 cent and G-unit guest appearances"". He's got a distinctive voice (one of the most important but overlooked features of an artist, a la current pop hip hop superstars 50, jigga, and em), a unique rhymin style, and can tell a good story that doesn't feature him braggin about his women, cars, and ""ice"". The CD has it's radio gems, its quality guest appearances, some annoying Ja Rule disses that I'm getting tired of (heard enough of that, but that's a whole other subject), but it also delivers tracks that set a scene where you can chill, smoke, and just ""hear"" what the obie has to say..."
2,Disappointing,"I got this album because Obie Trice did some great stuff on the 8 Mile soundtrack, so I figured I'd check out what else he'd done. This album just doesn't live up to that."
2,A letdown,"I had read Ms. Ledbetter's previous two books and enjoyed them both. However this one left me feeling flat..the plot seemed thin and formulaic; a frail framework to hold us in suspense not to wonder at the outcome of the murders, but to keep us enthralled with the frustrated romance of the main protagonists. It was as though she had to meet a publisher's deadline and, distractedly wrote this while doing 15 other things. I hope her next one features more of the wacky activities of her elderly sleuths....."
2,Misleading title,"This may be considered a ""beginners guide"" for tube audio design......if you have extensive electrical experience. As a rank beginner, I bought this book to help me understand amplifier design so I could better diagnose issues with my tube amplifiers. The first chapter, ""What is a vacuum tube"", was quite understandable and included a bit more info than I found on the internet. The book, however, went into overdrive for the remaining chapters, full of equations, electrical diagrams and charts that were not very well explained for a beginner. I recognize that things would get technical but I was hoping that as a beginner book there would be some explanation of things before it jumped in. I have experience reading simple wiring diagrams in order to repair small appliances and musical instruments. This book speaks a whole other language. I am sure someone with an solid foundation in electrical design would have no problem, but for the true beginner this book is far from useful."
1,What Next?,"This cd is horrible. I have loved townsend's work in the past, but this is just bad. Possibly one of the biggest cd disapointments of my life. Like weak coffee served luke warm. Every vapid track reeks so badly that it almost ruins the original (good) versions of these songs. Creativity, previously a Townsend halmark has been obliterated, or maybe just transmuted into tediousness. Without a doubt the worst thing Pete has been involved in since alcohol. What was he thinking? Was he? To me this is the equivlent of di Vinci getting a job animating Pokemon; so far below his potential that it's just a bad joke. Spend your money on something more worth while, like $20.00 of used chewing gum."
4,Stripped back genius,"I am a huge fan of the Who, but haven't got any other solo Townshend albums - I bought this to hear some of his original demos for Who's Next, and I was amazed by how complete they are as songs. When you imagine Roger, John & Keith having these presented to them, its no wonder they were willing to let Pete run the band.The extended version of Pure and easy here is much better than the version Daltrey sang when the band recorded it, and the versions of Behind Blue Eyes and Let's See Action are equally superb.My favorite track is the hard rocking version of Who Are You with what i consider a very well placed and powerful rap in the middle that updates the song very well to the new century.Good stuff."
1,What a piece of junk,"I saw this film (sadly) in a theater and only the fact that I was with friends kept me in the theater past the first 10 minutes. Pretentious crap. Lovely cinematography and a fair music score couldn't save pitiful performances, confused, pretentious (there's that word again) directing and silly script writing. Moronic."
5,orlando is the modern day tiresias!,"yes i might be a little crazy to compare orlando to the greek figure tiresias but i have to be honest. orlando is virginia wolfes verison of tiresias in some form. i love this movie and the actors that performed their parts. the music is good and the time jump from elizabeth the first to the modern day is well done. i recommed this gender-bending movie,because its spell casting and the story of searching for your own happiness is that good too."
4,"i don't eat it myself, but my kitty loves them.","my kitty loves these & I went all over to find them. when theyweren't in the stores anymore, I was so glad to find these,that I bought them out."
3,Works fine but not a fan of the fragrance,"I bought the Caribbean Lemon roll-on deodorant directly from the Fa site. I was searching for a roll-on with a clean light fresh citrus scent. The product works fine, but the fragrance is reminiscent of a bold, masculine shaving product or deodorant, such as Old Spice/Mennen. While the scent doesn't dominate for more than hour, it isn't my cup of tea. Years ago, I used Jean Nate roll-on deodorant (no longer available), and I thought the fragrance might be closer to that."
5,A Favorite,"This book is another wonderful read by Kate McMullan. We discovered it at the library a few months ago and checked it out so many times, we just bought our own!"
4,Great Gift for Kids,I bought these books to give as gifts and the kids that recieved them just loved them. I am glad you had them in stock as it would have been months waiting for the book store to get them in otherwise.
4,Green Acres,Green Acres dvds are good just did not like that both sides have the show on it you really have to look at dvd to see disc 1 or disc 2 and then it does not show side a or bother wise no problems
1,Man was this show dumb,"This show was so dumb, Its sad. Some should put Small wonder on DVD, Cuz that show was cool"
4,Nostolgia at its best,This is and was a fun series. Takes you back to a simpler time. Although you have to wonder how these two ever got together. LOLIt is a fun series. I liked it when I was younger and like it just as well now.I would also recommend the beverly hillbillies and pettiecoat junction. I just wish they would do the first season of pettiecoat junction as well.
2,Green Acres Then. Corny Now.,"There was one big laugh in the first episode. Other than that, this material, like so many other productions from long ago, doesn't hold up well. We bought the DVD because we moved from the downtown of a major city to a 225 acre ranch. We do hum the theme song occasionally and then laugh.Not recommended."
3,"Nice, but..","The mold itself is thick and sturdy and the wells are pretty deep, but the sticks are not in the center and it's hard to cover the stick with chocolate without it coming out of the mold. I would buy again because it's cheap."
5,So fun!,These candy molds are so cute and a fun addition to parties. I made chocolate molds for my sons Mario brothers birthday party and they turned out great!
2,Could Have Been Better,"""I have liked most of Lori Wick's books,but this book is not one I enjoyed. I had to make myself finish it. There were way too many unnecessary conversations and characters. I'm glad the people are concerned about their spiritual state, but I got extremely bogged down with all the sub characters' Bible studies,thoughts,etc. Is this book about the town people or Reece and Conner? The main couple in the book hardly had any story time for them. Characters who weren't even particular friends/relatives with the main couple had way too much page time. Also, more could have been said about Reece and Conner's personalities. I didn't think they even had a chance to get to know one another very well. The previous book was much better then this one was in my opinion. If you are looking for a good Lori Wick book to read I definitely recommend The Californians Series, The Cameron Series, The Kensington Chronicles, Sophie's Heart, Pretense, and The Princess."""
3,It was ok,"The book seemed somewhat unrealistic because of the overly exaggerated fear that the main character hads. She seems very weak and scared. I thought it could have been a much shorter book, because it was somewhat slow paced. I usually like Lori Wick books, but this was definitely not one of my favorites. It wasn't a bad book, but I suggest getting a library copy or a used copy from Amazon."
4,Good story,I definitely like this book better then the last couple books she has written. I actually cared about the characters instead of just trying to get through the book. I will say it had a slow beginning and I wish if she was going to keep bringing up Jace and Maddie that they would have actually had something to do with the plot line not just be the witness tool in the book. But I enjoyed the romantic side of the story.
2,Good Acting. Fair Story. Poor pacing.,"I watched this film because of the many glowing reviews of it which you can find here. Micheal Caine does a fine job portraying the relentless Jack Carter. He is very steely and cool, and brutal, and manipulative. Unfortunately, the film takes a very long time to get mildly interesting, and none of the characters are very likeable. I found it hard to believe Jack Carter's motive. Why would a man like him even care about his own brother?The film evokes one or two gasps, but no cheers. It is a seedy and ugly cloud, with no silver lining.Edgy as this film is, it would have been more interesting to me if Carter had gotten away with it. But then the film might have caused a moral outrage. So, instead, the screenwriters have Carter make a stupid fatal mistake. Sigh.Great as Caine is, he can't save this picture from the distasteful and unromantic world it _slowly_ portrays."
4,Definitive,"This is one of the great British gangster flicks of all time. All the new stuff on the market right now cannot hold a candle to this movie. You know the ones I mean, pale UK derivatives of Tarantino. Michael Caine was probably only better in ""The Man Who Would Be King"" and in ""Zulu"". His character here is completely amoral, which causes the brutal acts of violence to really be disturbing. And yet, he is not playing the carpet-chewing villain that today's movies show as gangsters.Recommended."
5,"A brilliant, chilling performance by Michael Caine","Recently for reasons which could only make sense to a Hollywood moneyman, this superb British film was remade with -- this seems hard to believe -- Sylvester Stallone in the title role. They really should not have bothered, because the original with Michael Caine in the lead could not be improved upon. Caine gives one of the most powerfully effective performances of his long film career as a mobster pursuing a deadly trail of vengeance. It is a veritable textbook of how to portray menace and obsession with chilling understatement. The new DVD-version features a commentary track by director Mike Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky with added material from Caine himself, explaining how the film was made and the decision process behind much of which was shown. Altogether, this is an excellent presentation."
2,Disappointing,"If you read this for tidbits about Fred Astaire, that's all you get are tidbits. If you read it seeking the feeling of Ireland, there are some nice descriptive moments in the book. Mostly it focuses on the author whose life and celebrity contacts did not make up for my disappointment in the skimpiness on Astaire and Ireland.I recommend instead titles by Niall Williams or reread Frank McCourt."
1,piece of junk,I was really let down by this toy. Bought this for my 10 year old son. It never worked very good. We could never get it to really focus on anything. My son tired of it very quickly and it got junked. I think it would have been worth investing in a pricier model.
1,why oh why?,"Isn't this girl so lucky to have such a frightful adventure and come away unharmed? And once that end of the story is over, it never gets brought up again. I'm not sure I expected somebody to follow her, but I did feel there would be some point to that part of the story. It just seems as if the main plot on it's own just wasn't good enough. Well funnily enough in the end the whole story just isn't good enough either."
1,Very poor text and photo quality.,"Avoid this book. It is a poor quality scan from a public library copy. The pictures are fuzzy and the size of the pages has been significantly reduced from the original. If possible, it is better to buy a used copy of the 1986 reprint from Da Capo Press. This is a high quality reprint and can be obtained used for about the same price. Had I known that the quality of the printing and scanning was so poor I'd never had considered it."
5,I love you mom!,"Mom, you are my best friend, my shining light, my inspiration! Thank you for using my drawing on the cover of your book. To be a part of your first book means the world to me and I support you 100% in your future endeavors! I love you mommy!"
4,Great Percussion!,"As a new-comer to Cuban music, I loved this album. Great sound. Great beat. My Cuban co-worker in the next office heard it thru the office walls and had to come over and borrow my cd. I didn't think he would give it back!"
2,Wrong size bottle and missing ingredients,"I received a 60 count bottle instead of the 90 that I paid for. Also there is no Goats milk and probiotic cultures as the website claims.Garden of Life Antioxidant Formula, Radical Fruits, Caplets, 90 caplets"
4,Good for Coaches,"The video has Vogelsinger teaching skill drills at a soccer camp. The detail is good for understanding the dribbling moves. It is long and not a good ""movie"" video. You will learn something to teach to your players that are at least 10 and over."
4,Real life characters and flowing story line grabbed me.,"For a first novel, Mr. Holly showed great writing potential. His story line and real life characters kept the reading flowing for me. Steve and Chris made me think of men of who went through hard life situations and wasn't so lucky to turn it around. Mr. Holly kept you cheering for the underdog, even though their behavior or actions were not always ""acceptable."" I was pleased to read how Mr. Holly allowed Steve to face up to his mistake and proceed to jail and not end up as a user. I was a little thrown off by his ""thinking out loud"" writing style. To me it seemed he was trying to tell two stories at one time. I would highly recommend this book to be added to a high school ""must"" read list. The novel shows people that you can turn your life around. Great effort Mr. Holly and much success on your next novel."
4,Nice shirt-sizes run larger than stated.,"I placed this order on a Sunday night, received Tuesday as expected. Shirts arrived brand new just like I ordered. The only problem I had with the shirts is, bought them for daughter-in-law, she needed them ASAP for a job she was starting on Tuesday. They say they are women's small. They fit like a women's medium or large in the length of the shirt. Shoulders fit fine. The hem of the shirt comes down to mid thigh. A little bulky for tucking in, but too much to leave out. She had to rush off to the nearest store to buy a white polo shirt that fit, so she could start work. Otherwise, yes nice shirt, order a size smaller than you actually wear. If you want small, order extra small and it might be just right."
5,No Dummies Here!,"On December 11, 2006 I adopted a 7 week old lab puppy who needed a home. So, as a retired teacher, I needed a guide! Walton's book is practical and well written to help new, or experienced,pet owners. It has practical tips and humorous insights that make it easy to read and full of useful information. Lucky, my lab, is growing happy and healthy and I am not tearing my hair out trying to figure things out on my own."
4,Don't Sleep! Slum Village the real Hip-Hop.,"Well y'all know buy now Slum Village has finally arrived and it was worth the wait. Even if you don't support this albums it still going to sell because they have the new sound that represents the new wave of Hip-Hop music...Talib Kweli, Black Thought..Dice Raw..De La Soul..Jill Scott and much more to come!"
4,"No heavyweight lyricism, only awesome beats","During the first listen of this album, please keep in mind that these are not top-notch lyricists and that the highlight of this album is the production. It is rare in hip hop where an album's production is so great that it makes you forget about the subpar lyrics, but this album does just that. The gems include: Conant Gardens, Hold Tight, Tell Me, I Don't Know, Fantastic/Untitled, and Fall In Love(my personal favorite). Jay Dee, who is also a member of the group, is one of the best producers in the industry. His unique sound is not only of hip hop, but of jazz and soul, and the blend of the three is wonderful. Although the lyrics can be greatly improved, I recommend this album for it's quality production."
3,Straps long and tangle easy,"I am not very happy with this purchase. First, the item looks black in the picture, but it is green and purple. That's not a big deal. The straps that you loop around your mat are adjustable, but are SUPER long. I have a 3/16"" jade mat and there is a lot of leftover tail. It would easily fit a much thicker mat, probably even my pilates mat. Ironically, the shoulder strap seems short. The other thing I don't like is the straps get twisted very easy. It seems to take quite a while to get it set up properly to buckle it so the straps aren't twisted and are centered on the mat. I'm going to go back to some sort of yoga bag/tote. Much quicker to get out of the studio when finished."
5,Very Impressive,"Just wow! I've never had a DVD packaged like this. It is a real book! It reminds me of a small child's book, all glossy and fascinating and full of pictures. Then safely nestled in the back is the actual Blu Ray disc. This is definitely a classic with a classic presentation.An Affair to Remember [Blu-ray Book]"
5,An Affair To Remember,"Great acting includes: suspense, humor and emotion. How refreshing to see a relationship between two people that transcends just physical attraction."
2,A Tearjerker?????,"While I realize that I am undoubtedly in the minority, I have to say that I found this movie to be a complete disappointment. I was told it was a ""tearjerker"" and that it would reduce me to marshmallow status. Bleh. While I enjoyed the first half (on the ship), I found the attempted sentimentality to be a bit much. And those warbling kids? Ugh. What trite garbage. The ending seemed forced and, in my opinion, leaves you hanging (does she walk again, or not? does he stay with her or not?). The entire scene with the grandmother... what was the point of THAT? Just a tacked-on excuse for overindulgence in quasi-sentimentality. Boring. I was very very disappointed in this movie... especially considering how much hype it gets (a lot, considering the fact that it's over 40 years old). I was expecting a sweet, slightly sappy, feel-good tearjerker. Instead I found it to be hackneyed and trite. Definitely one to skip. What a let down."
5,A Must See for all Romantics!,This Classic romantic has not lost its sentimental charm. Cary Grant is the epitomy of grace and old world wit. He is at his prime in this love story of two souls that find true love in a cruise. Deborah Kerr is magnificent as she plays a very difficult and fragile part with great dignity and decorum. She also shows great style and acting agility. This is a great chick flick with a superb cast. There is alot of comedic timing and the climactic end is heart wrenching. The movie is great for all romantics the world over.Noel Serrano
3,For health,nothing against nothing for. Its a vitamin that I need for my health. Cannot even analyze the pros. Therefore the fair recon
3,"Fairly pedestrian as ""X"" rated goes","Slow, not really great as one handed reading goes. Like a lot of books of this genre it has some good parts, but definitely not a ""page turner""."
4,Detailed Explanations,I am a basic user for AutoCAD and have found this book very helpful. It is a comprehensive book covering almost all the aspects of AutoCAD. The examples have made the concepts very easy to understand.
2,"""German Wirehaired Pointers"" by Newton L. Compere","Only the first 33 pages of this 190 page book are GWP specific. The rest is generic dog care info, and lots of marketing for certain brands of dog chews etc. Buy it if you are GWP mad, like us, and must have every book about them you can. Otherwise, don't! And definitely don't buy it expecting to find out what the breed is really like, or if they would suit you as a pet. This book does not contain enough information to help you make this type of decision! The only good point is the pictures in the first 33 pages."
4,Great quilt for napping.,Love the suede feel of this quilt. The kids love it and even the cat likes the feel. The whole transaction went really smooth.
1,Not pleased...,Pulled out of the plastic bag... felt the quality and quickly sent it back. You can find better for the price.
4,Does it's job...could be cheaper.,"The cable is great, and was easy to install. The only problem was the 4 1/2"" plastic box in the middle. But I was able to conceal everything neatly under the center console. I also don't know why the cord has to be so long (almost 3' !), but I guess it's better to have more than not enough.Overall, it serves it's purpose well. I just don't know why it had to be so expensive."
5,Nice personal suvival pack!,"If you're the least-bit preparedness minded, this belongs in your back pocket or purse. Adventure Medical makes these and puts quality tools in them. Adding stuff is a dubious proposition, as the thing's pretty well full, but there's so much here already. I never leave the house without this and my Swiss Army Knife."
3,NOT AS BAD AS YOU WOULD THINK,"THIS ""TOMMY"" SOUNDTRACK CD IS NOT REALLY ALL THAT BAD. I GIVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE 2 SONGS ON THIS ARE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS ARE: ""SALLY SIMPSON"" & ""SENSATION"". THEY G0T MORE OF AN ""EDGE"" TO THEM. ALSO, KEITH MOON SINGS ""FIDDLE ABOUT"" WHERE JOHN SINGS IT ON THE ORIGINAL. ALL IN ALL IF YOU ARE A WHO FAN, YOU SHOULD OWN IT. TAKE CARE."
2,"Awful, Absolutely Awful","If you want to hear Ann Margret and Oliver Reed butcher classic Who songs, than this is the album for you. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. The original Tommy was a masterpiece of simplicity. Besides some horn overdubs, it was basicially the Who and nothing else. Here, Pete Townshend throws in cheesy synthesizers and absolutley ruins the music. It doesn't help that there are people on here who have no business singing Who songs (the aformentioned Reed and Margret, plus Jack Nicholson). There are a few good moments, however. Eric Clapton's ""Eyesight To The Blind"" is in some ways superior to the Who's version, ""Sparks"" is pretty good, and the new version of ""I'm Free"" rocks. Otherwise, this album is an embarrassment. Especially Oliver Reed's singing. Avoid this one, it's definitely not worth the money."
4,Walk-Ins and Starseeds,"This is a neat little book, but I was somewhat disappointed with it because its main focus is on Walk-Ins and does not really focus on Starseeds or Lightworkers. Quite a few sections of the book did not apply to my areas of interest. However, I am certain it is an excellent read for people who believe themselves to be Walk-Ins and I would recommend it to them."
5,LOVE IT!,"My daughter LOVES her Veggie Tales songs! My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't start automatically, you have to wait through the beginning stuff to press play."
1,Veggie Tales,I have purchased these DVD for my new grandsons who are only 18 months old but they love the characters and music of these DVDs.Hopefully they will learn all the moral values that are included in the tapes as they grow older.
2,IT WAS OK,"THE ORIGINAL ""SILLY SONGS"" WAS JUST THAT, SILLY SONGS. LOVE THE SONGS ABOUT PIRATES, LIPS AND HAIRBRUSHES, BUT, THIS REMASTER SEEMS TO THROW IN SOME OF THE BIBLICAL SONGS. I AM NOT A FAN OF THE VEGGIE TALES GOD SONGS, AND THOUGHT THIS ONE WAS JUST THE ""SILLY SONGS"" CD. JUDITH"
4,cute,"My kids love watching it, but I personally go nuts when I have to listen to it! ha! The messages they send are very positive and I think kids really enjoy the ""silly factor""."
4,Not as cute as other Veggie Tales,This is not as good as other VT videos in my opinion. And I am concerned about the song that says God is bigger than the monsters hiding in your room. Scarey!
