3,Works OK...,It works but seems fragile. I'm sure my daughter will break it soon. The concept is pretty smart and works well but the plastic just doesn't feel like it will last. The instructions were a bit wanting but I figured it out.
2,Good features that do not work well,I installed this unit using the double sides sticky tape I did not use the screws because I did not want to damage my door. The best feature is that you can lock the door behind you and still enter the door from opposite side of the child lock. The down side is that after a week the part that sticks to the door came off and now the lock non functional.
2,Just so so,The original casts for these plays set the bar so high I guess I was expecting much more from this CD. Music was ok but each vocal sounded like the other.
2,OK for MP3s but Horrible for Audible,I was looking for something that plays Audible as well as MP3s but the Lyra is not it. Do not buy this unit if you plan to use it for Audible files. As far as MP3 player it is acceptable but I suspect there are far better units on the market that do both equally well. Until I find that unit I will go back to my old Creative Zen for audible and my Oregon Scientific for music.
3,A little chintzy,"I bought this hat because I wanted a nice Illini cap. In general, the logo is nice, but the fabric is pretty thin and chintzy. Also, the hats seem to run small. I bought the largest (XL) size. This should be a 7 1/2 or 7 5/8 size. My head measures 23.5"" around which should be a good fit. It fits like a swim cap. There is no ease in the fit. The other review said they liked it because they had a small head which makes sense in light of what I found. I'll likely keep it, but for an $18 fitted cap, I'm just not in love with it."
1,Disappointed!,"My [kid] got this and shared it with her (...) class. They followed the instructions to the letter. Finally out came a whole bunch of the ugliest moth-looking like creatures. All of the children were so disappointed. Here they had seen the cover of the box with these orange painted lady butterflies! I called the company and they so nicely explained that these are not the colorful American Painted Lady butterflies. They are a different species that are much more gray and moth looking. We even had a bug expert come in to my daughter's class and tell us the ""butterflies"" sure looked like moths to her too! My question is, ""Why does the company show colorful orange butterflies on the package when that is not what they are sending?"" Very disappointing and not worth the money."
3,Overpriced! It's just a cylindrical net.,"The product is fun, educational and reasonably durable, no problems there. But at over twenty dollars, it is just a simple, lightweight mesh net sewn into a cylinder -- that's it. There are no accessories to embellish the ""habitat"" or to nurture the inhabitants -- just the tubular net with a zipper for $20. This product should cost just $8 and at that price would be properly valued."
3,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Pavillion,"I was very disappointed when this kit arrived and there were no caterpillars included. I find the term kit very misleading. I had to order the caterpillars separately, and they charged me an additional $5 for shipping. The kit is good, other than that. I also found that it was $5 cheaper if you just order from the site."
1,False Advertising!,"RCA advertises that this mp3 player is compatible with Macs - It is not! The software they send you works only with windows. Apparently, a long time ago, an unrelated company hacked a way to make it work with macs but they no longer exist/support the software/supply the software. After finally finding a Windows infected PC (I live in the world of UNIX, LINUX, Mac), I discover the software comes attached with Marketing subprograms. I also had to re-copy cd's to actually get them into the .mp3 format - which is old and unused by more competetive music players. The radio works passably well. Haven't tried the audio books or sports features yet."
4,Love it,"Brought mp3 player mainly for the gym; had it for over a year now. For my purposes, it's great. Holds plenty of songs, great gym features (pulse, stop watch, radio). I haven't had any problems with sound or use. Purchased a different set of headphones though and use rechargable battery.did have top replace the plastic belt clip once, kind of fragile."
4,WHAT??!,"I love sailor moon! I don't know why, but I still find this quirky show to be entertaining! Anyway. I didn't buy this here. I found it cheaper somewhere else... SHHHHH!! I can't tell you... lest the amazon gods smite us all!!! haha! Anyway, some of the subbing is missing in sailor stars... that kinda sucks but you can still follow what is happening. It's worth it."
3,umm.. i never trust this thing but i wish they would actually come out,well i don't usually trust this cause i don't know what i am buying and from who well i love sailor moon for reals i do i have still my movies(VHS) i wish i could see them since we still have a old VHS in our homes but since its old it ate one of my sailormoon movie T^T so i never watch them no more i have a DVD and its about this one sailormoon super s i got in a game stop for $12 but i haven't check if there any now but if this okay i believe if your a truly a sailor moon you would try your best to see it again you guys are the best i wish i could buy this but yeah no money even if its bu leg or not but hope its a good thing do...
1,"This is a bootleg, avoid it!","More than likely wait for the new Sailor Moon anime in 2013, and there'll probably be a re-license of the older series.Try to support it, rather than going out and buying this."
5,"Works on 2"" wooden blinds!",I bought this to fight the dust on my two inch wooden slat blinds even thought the tines of the product are closer together than that. It works very well! Yey!
3,Amtrak and the Midwest,Good book on the impact of Amtrak on the Midwest. Summaries for each route and history behind where service existed before Amtrak. Only black and white pictures. Recommended for anyone who is interested in the Midwest and Amtrak.
2,Amazon is only shipping a single Level 1 dvd not Level 2,"I am not reviewing the content, only the description of the course as a two dvd set of levels 1 and 2. Amazon is only shipping a single level 1 disc, I have already returned this product as incomplete, yet received the same product again when it re-shipped. Just a warning so you don't go through the same problems I am having."
5,Perfect fit,"Great price! Easy to install. Didn't look exactly like the one that came out, but I'm sure it was the right part."
1,BORING!,"I have read all but 3 of the Goosebumps books. Most of the others are awesome, but I hated this one. This book wasn't scary, and it was just way too descriptive"
3,It was OK. It was not as good as the others.,"It was pretty good. The middle and the end cool. But the beginning was boring it just tells about the girl and it does not tell about what happened.The best part was when Judith spilled tapioca pudding on Samantha's new shoes.I like all the books I,ve read so far!LACEY ALEXANDRA AGE 9 ( and a half)"
2,I skipped to the end,I really tried to finish this book. I liked (sort of) her other goddess books but this one was a chore to read. Apollo was just to bland and whishy washy -Artemis stole the book from him. Who cared about the heroine ( I can't even remember her name). A waste of money -borrow this or get it from the library.
4,Solid advice for anyone in a serious relationship,"While parts of this book may seem a little outdated or ""old-fashioned"" (especially the advice to abstain from sexual activity until marriage, thus no discussion on sexual compatibility) I think the bulk of the message is pretty useful. The take-home message is not going to shock you: Find someone with similar values, habits and interests. But it probably bears repeating, and is broken down into easily analyzable components. I found it particularly useful to journal about these issues as I was reading the book. Many of us may need to be reminded that the significant incompatibilities we may have with our potential life partner should not be taken lightly. This book is a practical, quick read that will help you organize your thoughts as you contemplate the very important question of whether you should get married to the person you are with."
3,Good Fan for what I needed it for,"This is a very good fan for what I needed it for. It is on my desk at work, and when the AC is not working or the Heater is in overdrive (Keep in my I am a female in my 40's & starting the change in life), it does the job needed and very well.It would be great if this fan had a remote control, because of where on my desk it sits, I have to stretch pretty good in my chair to turn it on. The oscillating button is a little hard to push on and I sometimes have to stand up to turn it on. But hey that is just a little more exercise, right?Overall I like the fan."
2,It's okay at best,The fan is quiet as advertised but sometimes makes a whining noise. That didn't bother me. It's major defect lies in the oscillation. The fan won't stop oscillating! Even when the power is off it still oscillates. I also expected the wind to be more powerful. I have to have it sit on my nightstand right next to my bed to feel it and even then it's just okay. I'm returning this item.
2,"Works, but it sounds like a TRUCK!","This fan looks and works, mostly, as described; however, I am one of the customer who got the noisiest little fan out there. It's incredible. I've never heard a fan sound this obnoxious without being broken or something. DO NOT BUY (...unless you don't mind noise pollution)!!!!"
1,Too small and underpowered,this is a seriously underpowered fan that is much smaller than I expected and it keeps cutting out. I wish I could return it but I live in Australia so postage is too much.
5,keeps me cool,"perfect fan. It is not a silent fan but that isn't a problem, and it's not like it's so loud either. Keeps me cool"
4,Nice fan,"A lot of fan for the price and size. Unlike other reviewers I don't find the noise to me loud, it seems to be drowned out by the ambient noise. Fan oscillates fine. I just wish that it had a medium speed instead of just a low and high."
2,Noisy,It's way too noisy - and not in a fan type way. It's a high pitched annoying squeal. This is worsened by the fact that it only works if you're a few feet away from it.
2,Not a Fan of Lasko (excuse the pun),"I wish I could say that I had the experience of the majority of reviewers when it comes to the Lasko 4000. Unfortunately, I am definitely the exception here. It worked fine at first, but after around 6 months, it started becoming increasingly noisy. Given that I had this in the bedroom, it didn't make for a comfortable night's sleep. In about the 8th month, I had picked it up while cleaning and later found that when I turned it on, the noise level had escalated and it didn't seem to work properly. Once again being the exception to other reviewers, I actually had a much better experience with the Brookstone MiniMax fan. It's still going strong and unlike the Lasko fan, you can set 1,2 and 3 hour intervals before auto shut-off. Even without that feature, I would have been happy with Lasko if it hadn't burned out on me."
1,Short Lived,"Great looking fan, however it only lasted two years before the verticle bearing wore out. It's not worth the money to cover only two summers. I won't buy another one."
2,"Very noisy fan, and the buttons are too bright","Bought this fan the other day, already returned it. It's a great little fan, it does work well, but it is SO LOUD. It has this high pitched whirring noise, that is loud even on the lowest setting. I bought this for my bedroom to help cool down my room so I can sleep, it was too loud, I could not sleep to it. Also, the buttons are too bright. They are a bright blue when the fan is on, and it lit up my entire room. Another reason I couldn't sleep. I would recommend this fan for an office that may get rather noisy to the point that you wouldn't notice the noise of the fan, but not for a bedroom if you are planning to keep it on all night."
2,It's not quite...,The 2nd day I used the fan it started rattaling. Now it sits on the floor under my desk to cool off my feet. While I have a real fan on my desk.Worthless if you are looking for a quite fan.
4,RISE,"I've always loved Herb Albert, even as a teenager. We're talking 30+ years here. I was so pleased to realize that he's still recording, and still recording outstanding scores."
2,Buy a Book,"This is truly basic etiquette for the socially challenged. The information is good and useful as far as it goes, but for the hefty price I expected more material, more situations and more demonstrations. The content and format are the same in the adult and teen sections. The teen actors gave the impression that the lessons were wasted on them... hardly encouragement for a teen viewer."
5,"Translucent Soul, indeed","A more soothing and thought-provoking listen has been a long time past. Ellis's voice is clear and precise, and each song on this album is a dip into still waters, which sometimes run deep... sometimes not so much. My favorite is actually the untitled and very short hidden track. Take a listen!"
3,"Alright read, but I would suggest others","This book gives a brief history of the Church, its beliefs, and various other things Catholically related. I think this would be for someone entering the Catholic Church, or for those who have been away from the Church for some time now, but I don't think it's written in the way it should be for welcoming souls into the Church that Christ established. I would suggest reading another book and being well-grounded in your Faith before reading this, because there's nothing you're missing in here."
3,SMOKIN,"I CHOOSE SMOKIN TO COMPLEMENT CAMERONS SMOKER, I BOUGHT THE BOOK VERSION, THEN AFTER WAITING 2 MONTHS I BOUGHT THE KINDLE VERSION, THEN RECEIVED THE BOOK A FEW WEEKS AFTER.RECIPE BOOKS ARE BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN MARK AND COPY RECIPES FROM THE BOOK, AND CAN FIND WHAT YOU WANT EASIER. I WANTED CHICKEN, THEN WANTED MORE OF THE SAME BUT HAD GO THROUGH TURKEY BEFORE FINDING MORE CHICKEN RECIPIES.RECIPES BOOKS ON KINDLE DONT HAVE PAGE NUMBERS, INDEXES. THEY SHOULD BE SET UP TO BE COPIED AND JUSE PAGE NUMBERS AND INDEXES.THE BOOK IS 4 STARS THE KINDLE VERSION 2 STARS."
4,An Interesting Book by a Conservative,I enjoyed the book. I was somewhat surprised to find the author so conservative but so be it. Mr. Krock did know quite a few presidents and his insights are informative.
5,DEFINITELY BANGIN,"SHAQ FINALLY GETS HIS RESPECT FROM ME THIS CD IS A CLASSY CD . I ALWAYS MONITOR WHAT MY KIDS LISTEN TO. FOR ANY PARENT THAT IS READING THIS SHAQ HAS A QUALITY CD. WITH NICE DANCE RHTYMS ON IT . WHAT A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT, I KNOW BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT 10 . SHAQ IS THE ONLY RAP I WILL BY FOR MY KIDS AND FRIENDS KIDS"
3,"Okay to watch once, then go back to Jesus of Nazareth","This miniseries is good, but when you compare it to other movies of Jesus that are out there, it falls several steps behind.I know the moviemakers were trying to portray Jesus as more human as well as divine, but I just didn't get it.I watched the movie a second time and found myself doing the same thing I did when I first saw Jesus: I pulled out my DVD of Jesus of Nazareth."
1,Shame before God!,"This ""movie""...key word movie was horrible. The closest biblical accuracy was it's title Jesus' name. Trying to portray Jesus as weak and indecisive is shameful. Also the movie indicates Mary and Jesus were in love. None of this is biblical. After the first 15 minutes 13 minutes too long I turned to something else. I hope that NO ONE will wacth this and thinks that this is an accurate portrayal of our Lord and Savior ""JESUS"" Christ!!!"
5,jan,The most in spiring movie I have ever watched I would recomend it to anyone who belives or dosen't believe
5,"Finally, a Savior You WANT to Follow","I remember watching Jesus of Nazareth when I was a child and thinking, ""Why would anyone want to follow someone so mean-looking?"" He never smiled, laughed, or showed love. This came on TV when I was a teenager, and I loved it. I remember a group of friends getting together in college and watching it again. We cried. Maybe it's not quite as accurate as some movies, but it represents a Jesus that I am proud to have faith in. If I thought that God did not have a sense of humor, I would be very hesitant to follow him. If you want scriptural accuracy at the expense of Godly love, watch Jesus of Nazareth. If you want to see a Christ that you would give your life to follow, watch this."
1,Worldly,"The Gospels are always a challenge to adapt to screen, but this time they didn't even try. The beginning was pretty typical: Lots of flash and color with Roman soldiers, Priests and Scribes, and, of course, Herod with Herodias and the inevitable Solome (odd that she's often given a central role, since she isn't even named in Scripture, and only mentioned once). So for about ten minutes I sat tight, waiting for the good stuff, like Jesus' baptism, the calling of The Twelve, and the Sermon on the Mount, but the when Jesus finally shows up, he's in Bethany making sheep-eyes at Mary. Blasphemy! The Bibical Jesus would never for a moment have contemplated a different path than the one He knew His Father wanted for Him, even when He was as young as twelve years. We turned it off right away, knowing the rest couldn't be much better. Don't buy this."
1,They sent me a Church tape,"NOT the Jeremy Sisto, Gary Oldman film.Yes the dvd is named ""Jesus"" but it says on the package ""This DVD was mailed to homes in your area as a gift from a partnership of local Chrisian churches. No solicitation for funds will be made.""Uhh, this ain't no Hollywood flick. They sold me a freebie, and claimed it was the movie I ordered."
1,The most innacurate depiction of Jesus...,Biblically innaccurate...They made it seem as though Jesus was unsure of his purpose which is clearly not what the scriptures say...
1,"Not Bible-based, inaccurate, fabricated facts.","Though the film is well produced and directed, there were horrific inaccuracies, all within the first 20 minutes. The time and place of Joseph's death are NOT known. NOWHERE in the Bible do you find this. It is NOT written in the Bible that Joseph advised Jesus on when to do the things he did. It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus ever said he, ""loved,"" Mary (Mary and Martha, not his mother). It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus demanded of God that Joseph be brought back to life. It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus said, ""I cannot do this alone!"" This video is as big an inaccurate and fabricated mess as ""Noah."" Any Christian, or anyone with any knowledge at all of the Bible, would not watch this video or recommend it to anyone."
2,Need more details,This book is just a trifle too easy. It's too DIY. I didn't really get much out of it. Lots of pretty pictures but not enough timeless tips.
3,What comes around goes around...,"The title pretty much says it all being a raw wall of noise and sound akin to a load of scrap metal being dumped down a staircase. Pretty straight forward, albiet it a tad cliched, old-school speed metal.... BUT...what makes it a bit diferent from the pack are elemental lyrical and stucture elements that would later develop into something quite wonderful in the way of sound and imagery in following releases, so I recommend Rooarr as a stepping stone in the Voivod trilogy. In many ways this is a small backward step from Voivod's first release, the more accessible War and Pain, as if they are trying to find their footing and 'place"".Plus, its a lotta raucous pounding FUN and I get all sweaty and smelly just listening to Snake and Co pound and rip through this!BTW...I owned this recording on vinyl (!!) many years ago when it was first released. Now re-exploring my speed/thrash heritage Rrroooaaarr is a standout in my collection. And it should be in yours as well.Enjoy."
5,Great for our baby's weight gain,"Our baby wasn't gaining weight. The Doctor said to use this product. Alimentum breaks down the protein in the milk, allowing for easier digestion. I'm happy to report, our baby is now gaining well AND has gained back all the ounces she was behind! Buying it by the case is best value I have found anywhere!"
1,Dented cans!,"I have ordered this formula from Amazon many times. I have never had a problem in the past, but this shipment came with 5 of the 6 cans dented. Will not order this product from Amazon again. Bummed!!"
3,works only if baby can endure taste/smell,"My baby was very gassy with regular formula and would cry so much and didn't sleep well either. We tried Alimentum and found it to eliminate the gas problem, as it is more gentle on the stomach.It should be noted, however, that this formula has a very strong smell. It smells like old beans, smelly socks, and cheese all wrapped up into one. I know my baby is not particularly fond of this taste. It's too bad it doesn't taste/smell better. I am now mixing with another formula, so I can hide the taste of this one.Also, this formula produces runny stools or diarrhea in some cases. I noticed it right away and when I contacted Similac, they also informed me that the formula would do this. Also, stool color is almost black, so don't be alarmed."
4,Does the job,"This product works well for our son that was very colicky and suffers from reflux. The formula is expensive, but worth it."
3,help,can anyone tell me if Similac Alimentum has palm oil in it's ingredients? where i live currently its not sold this kind of similar and i just trying to decide if i should order it from US ?
1,Subtitle misleading,"I needed a book on software radio and so I gladly bought this book when I came across it. I expected a lot of detailed information about DSP and software radio.It's a thick book: 700 plus pages. However, DSP related contents only add up to 50 pages or so. Detailed treatment of software radio cannot be found anywhere. Even the itemized index has only one instance of 'software radio'. This book is mostly on (analog) circuit design issues for amps, mixers, oscillators, PLLs, etc.I strongly doubt the authors' intention of using the subtitle 'DSP, Software Radios, and Design'. If you want to know more about software radio, you wouldn't get it from this book."
3,Good but not great,"I approached this book hoping for an analysis of the impact of emptiness and isolation on the human psyche. No doubt my expectations were influenced by my nationality -- Australian -- where our ""playas"" (which we call claypans or saltpans) are nearly all isolated and deserted, and the impact of human activity is minimal.Fox provides graphic descriptions of the multiplicity of activities which take advantage of the US playas, ranging from military to counter-cultural festivals. He's clearly very well acquainted with his subject.I found it generally depressing to read about the military use of playas. (Here in Oz, we had the Brits testing atomic devices at Woomera several decades ago.)An interesting book, but too focused on American issues to satisfy my more general interests."
2,Disappointing quality,"I bought this as a list minute addition to a sub-for-santa gift, and I was disappointed in the quality of the case. It's very lightweight wood and it has a cheap feel. I would rather have a plastic case that I know is going to be cheap than a wood case that feels and looks cheap. I've bought a few art sets over the years, and at $16, this one is overpriced. I would have been better off buying a tote box and filling it with cheap art supplies."
3,customer service,"Con: the whole ordeal on is it coming or not, back order or in stockPro: the people I spoke with were awesome and honest, and I appreciate that.It came the day after Christmas.Con: The plastic case within the wooden case was not attached to the wooden case itself, so when you open it, Everything would fall down.Pro: A little bit of apoxy fixed it right up!Con: The wooden case is not what you see in the picture. It is just a pine box with no staining or anything. Simply a box any semi-handy personcould make.Pro: You can stain it your self, or decorate it, cover in felt or fabric or whatever. You could even spray the top with chalk board spray paint that any home depot carries. Thus for, creating another use for this set.My 11 year old daughter loves this set. It is kinda cheap looking compared to the picture seen on here. But , my lil' girl is happy and that's all that matters to me, really."
1,Too expensive,"So disappointed, I did not think the money I paid is worth it. The case is so cheap as well as the supplies and I got it supposedly on sale...really.. Too late to return it bec it was a Christmas gift and I did not have time to get a new art & craft supplies."
5,wonderful art kit,"I bought this for my nephew who has an interest in drawing. After receiving it, he called me and told me it was wonderful! He enjoys drawing with pencils but was experimenting with the other choices included in the kit. I'm very pleased with it!"
1,Item delivered is not the same as being advertised!,"The product received was from Art Alternatives, not Macpherson. The item actually received can be had for $15 to $20 cheaper at other websites. The item itself is okay, but it should be disclosed on Amazon what you are actually getting so that you can make informed price comparisons."
4,Help!,hi my name is hannah and i live in england. this book isn't out in england 4 ages so i would appreciate it if sum 1 cud type the paragraph that it has on the bk of the book on here 4 me plz
1,Does NOT Do The Book Justice,This is a terribly disappointing movie. Krakauer's book is one of the best I've read. Don't buy this movie if you are expecting it to be as exciting/consuming/imagination provoking as the book. It is none of the above.
1,Bad Acting further embelishes Krakoar's slanted account,"This movie is terrible. It's overacted and worse, magnifies the characatures that John Krakoar's (sp?) moralizing views of the disaster of Everest."
1,Krakauer's Personal Fantasy,"Not worth the paper it's printed on! There are several accounts of the tragedy that occurred that day on Everest on both the South and North Face. The amazing thing is that all accounts match, except this one! Krakauer has made himself a hero and everyone else a buffoon, including the Sherpas! What nonsense! It appears that the altitude has inflicted memory damage and self worship deeply into Krakauer's brain. Both Rob Hall and Scott Fischer were highly experienced guides that regarded the safety of their client's much more important than a summit. Do not read this book or see the incredibly non factual DVD! There are many other books and movies that give accurate accounts, please try them!"
4,A riveting story well told.,The incredible happenings on Mt. Everest in spring 1996 were at once a tragedy and a human drama. This movie won't become a classic by any stretch; but if you're familiar with the basics of the story then it brings it to life very well.
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid","With bad acting, bad screenwriting, bad editing and bad directing, this DVD should easily take its place among the dead with the 1996 Everest disaster. The obituary should be written and posted wherever this attempt at filmmaking is sold. Like an overzealous amateur mountain guide in over his head, this product was rushed into production, failed miserably, discovered frostbite, got injected with morphine, lost its feet, slipped on the way down and died in a crevasse. Don't waste your time."
1,GREAT BOOK---POOR MOVIE,Don't waste your time with this Hollywood movie if you read the book (which is one of the most thrilling books ever)--but maybe see one of the true documentaries on EVEREST to see what the experience really looks like.
1,They Killed a Great Story,"By this time everyone knows what happened on Mt. Everest in 1996, so I'll spare you the replay. Forget the question of whether this film was true to the written accounts, it's just a dreadfully written, acted and produced film. Those associated with this project have managed to take one of the most compelling stories of recent years and turn it into a very flat account about a group of very one-dimensional characters. It's just incredibly bad on so many levels!"
5,Into Thin Air dvd,"Amazon is a great resource for shopping. This wasthe tape I wanted and they had it....Prompt, efficient service.......5 stars"
1,Everest Enthusiasts - Beware,What a huge disappointment. I'm still hoping that someone will get it right. Using Krakauer's account (Into Thin Air) would be a good starting point.
5,Country,"I ordered this cd to get the song ""The Cave"" which I heard several years ago. This song makes you stop and think about what can happen now in this day and age. This CD has different types of songs on it. This is a Little Darlin CD and it is excellent if you like Johnny Paycheck type of music."
1,TSA took all the locks off and tossed them,"We purchased 4 of these locks for travel and first used them last week. We put them on the bags and had no problem setting the combo or locking them. We were feeling really good telling people how they worked. Alas, we got the bags back and the locks were missing with the notice of baggage inspection in each bag. If Samsonite is going to sell me a product based on a TSA acceptance they need to be perfectly honest and say ""it often does not get accepted by TSA"". A big waste of money."
4,Good explanation for little ones..,Great book that explains essence of Bhagavad Gita in a colorful picturesque British style.Shared with few kids who really liked reading the book.
1,La Mer is great but these sellers sell fake La Mer,"I've been using La Mer for 3 years now and always purchased it from Bloomingdales. I saw it on Amazon for a great price and decided to get the bigger jar and purchase it. I received it today and not only did it not come in the original box, the smell of this cream is not LA MER! All my jars of La Mer smelled exactely the same and this jar smells of heavy perfume. It is fake! Do not buy from them!"
5,Love it!,"I got this book just as a resource to make a few recipes and table decs for a colonial tea. After paging through the first section, I was hooked -- read the book straight through, and the next day did the same thing all over again. This is a gorgeous, creativity-boosting reference, with unusual ideas and lots of historically inspired recipes. It's already one of my favorite entertaining books!"
5,you swear the Bosstones were in your freaking house.,"This disc is awesome. Buy it now, if you know what's good for you, you won't regret it. Best live disc i've ever heard, you can almost hear Ben dancing around on stage. So buy the disc, get some Cowboy Coffee, turn the Lights Out, and listen to the Kinder Words Dicky and the boys blast out your speakers. Enough said."
4,probably my favorite Bosstone's album,"I'm not really a big fan of the Bosstones, but I bought this album anyways, just for the hell of it. Well, come to find out, this album really isn't that bad. There are a couple of songs that I don't really care for, but other then that, not half bad. If you are a fan, this is a must. If you kinda like them, this is a good pick up. If you hate them, they why are you even reading this anyways?"
5,Great Idea,This is a great product. I have been really worried about how my 3 year old daughter is gonna take being a big sister. She has been very spoiled her whole life. When we got this book in the mail she was so happy. I am only 13 weeks so she has plenty of time to wait until she can use the book but she thought it was really cool. I think this a good idea to keep them involved.
5,UFO's,I liked watching these on cable but now I can watch them anytime. I have always wondered about the lights in the sky
2,"It's allright, but that's about it.","Dark edged euro-pop are the words that come to mind when I try to describe this album. It's not that it's bad, but it's simplistic and, for me, a dissapointment. There's some catchy tunes, but compared to earlier work it seems very tame. I think the attempt to integrate Lovefcraftian themes into this album makes it seem all the more comical. For some good electro/industrial interpretations of Lovecraft look for a compilation called The Challenge From Beyond. For good Electro/Industrial, look for VNV Nation or Velvet Acid Christ."
4,lots of heartbreak and high lonesome sadness.,"This record has more rock'n'roll spirit than a million modern ""punk"" or ""alternative"" albums. Sure, it's country and that might make it un-cool for urban hipsters, but this is pure heart-felt, honest and true American music. Like many country artists of the 50's and 60's, Faron Young has an almost blues-like quality. The songs are timeless in that they deal with love, drinkin', livin' hard and loss. Those are just the kind of topics that never go out of style or get boring because they are at the very core of the human experience."
3,Interesting characters,The characters were interesting and who doesn't like a cougar love story? The physical transformation that took place for the hero was improbable. Too bad..
4,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"New Moon [VHS]This film creates a delightful and nostalgic journey. It's splendidly performed by two really great singers. My one regret is that it has yet to be issued on DVD. When this happens, and I anxiously await it's happening, I will be one of the first ones, when notified, to obtain one or more copies."
4,A Neil Simon comedy classic!,"Comparable to his later success, Biloxi Blues and Lost in Yonkers, California Suite is a set of four playlets set in one hotel room. They feature A- A divorced couple meeting to decide on their daughter's futureB- A man with a hooker in his room tries to hide her when his wife comesC- A neurotic actress and her homosexual husband come to town for the OscarsD- Four friends really get to know what it's liked going on vacation together.The first and third are the best, because they combine wit and emotion. The other two are hilarious, but somewhat hollow. Overall, it is worth reading, and certainly ranks as one of Simons best in the past 25 years."
4,Great conversation pieces!,"I like this a lot better then the ""Would You Rather"" books by Doug Fields. These are much more appropriate for a youth group. There are some corny ones that we skipped over, but for the most part, the kids liked it, and it got them talking."
5,Review of Unfinished Sentences.,I was very pleased with the timely manner in which I received this item since it was a Christmas present for my niece. The book arrived in the exact condition described by the seller.
2,For professionals only !,Good book but only for people that love sailing ! For sure when I will start salling will be an excellent book !
5,AMAZING ARTIST!,Idina is an amazing artist that puts her whole heart and soul into her music! I recommend this CD to everybody and they all love it! I can't wait till her next CD! :-)
4,Gambit,Gambit came early. He's not real flexible. I don't think he has any educational value. I do like having him in my collection though.
3,"Well written, but too Oracle specific","Enjoyed this book, and the lessons are very straight-forward, but the majority of the code supplied is pretty Oracle-specific. I had a devil of a time getting the code to work in a Microsoft environment (SQL Server or Access 97).As a beginner, I actually found Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta to be a better book. Forta provides notes on what will and won't work in what programs.Overall, this book was helpful, and it will probably remain a useful reference edition. But if I were going to choose again, I'd get the 10 minute version first."
2,deja vu??,"i can sum this video up in one number and 2 words--2 recap episodes. the first episode is new and pretty good, Heero tries to pilot the Wing 0 and ends up being ""taken over"" if you will, by the 0 system. The next two episodes are recap episodes, the first told by relena, the second, by treize. one new scene pops up at the end, a shot of the new gundam, Epyon. I haven't been disssapointed by any one of these videos until now. I'd say skip this video, you won't miss much."
5,My 4 yr old LOVES this toy!!!,"This is a great toy! My son plays hard with it! I don't know why people are complaining about the fish not floating. Where does it say this is a bath/water toy? My son sits on his bed/the sofa and fishes off the floor. Kids have great imaginations. We've also have large fridge magnets (alphabet letters) and made a game. I'll tell him to go fish for a ""Q"" and he tries to catch it. The song is hard to understand and the water noises sound like a toilet flushing which he thinks is hilarious. The pole telescopes down so we store it all in a cheap tool box we got from Walmart.We love this toy. The price is EXCELLENT!"
3,fishing rod,All my daughter wanted for Christmas was a fishing rod. This is a nice toy for the tub. The magnetic fish are fairly heavy duty. The fishing rod makes nice sounds. It's held up well.
2,Disappointed....,"My son has a good collection of John Deere products ranging from the outdoor pedal tractor to the flashlight and books... so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to his collection. However, after using the toy for just a few minutes, we realized that it doesn't actually roll all the way up. As you turn the reel, the line comes up about a foot, then goes back down...so you don't actually get the fish all the way up...which, I kind of thought was the point, you know?...reeling the fish in, right? Plus the magnets have to be really lined up well to connect...so I only gave them 2 stars....I think they could make some more improvements on this one..."
4,Good toy!!,My 3 years old son really loves this fishing rod. It makes fishing sounds and a little song. Seem to be a quality toy up to now.I gave 4 stars because I'm a little dissapointed that the reel doesn't work like a real one. It doesn't stop all the way up when you're bringing it back. It stops 4 inchs before the end of the rod and then goes back the other way. But it's just a toy and it prevent kids from turning too much and breaking something.
1,Very Disappointed,"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son. It doesn't reel! You can't take it apart to try to fix it because of the way the rod is attached. The magnetic fish are difficult to catch, the magnetic pull isn't strong enough. Overall a bad buy! We are sending this back and getting the learning resources fishing pretend play one. DON'T BUY!!!!"
1,Waste of Money,I bought this toy for my 4 year old son for this past christmas. I figured as much as he loves fishing he would love this toy. Very disappointed when i received this item. Maybe held his interest for a minute. The String doesn't reel in and can barely hold the fish. It is a hunk of crap.
5,"If you want ONE guide to the Cape, this is it!","I spotted this Lonely Planet guide for the Cape at the library. Using it during a long weekend at the Cape made me realize I needed to own it. It contains a wealth of useful, interesting information about what to see and do--and every restaurant evaluation from it was accurate. This guidebook is worth every penny for a family or a couple traveling alone."
4,FEEL GOOD BOOK,"Good book to read, and very romantic, always like to read the man's point of view specially in matters of the heart. A salute to Ms. Mullins"
5,Amazing and easy to use,I bought this to use for a project and it was perfect. It arrived in great condition and earlier than I thought. It is sharp and easy to use.
5,Works great,"I don't have much time for crafts, but I frequently make things for use in Sunday School, decorations for my kids' birthday parties, etc. I didn't even know punches that make large circles even existed until recently. What a timesaver! I have cut many circles out by hand over the years - wish I had known about this sooner! :)"
3,"Not the best game in the world, but good.","This game is all right for P.S.2. The graphics rock, the characters are pretty cool, and the moves are pretty neat. But i wouldn't rate this game 5 stars. Hworang, Eddy, Paul, and Armor King are the guys that I reccomend the most. Any one else really ... to tell you the truth. The moves are cool, especially Eddy's. I really don't think that the game is th best, but all in all, the game isn't that bad."
2,Disappointment,"I have the import version of this game.It is exactly like Tekken 3. There are literally no new characters, no CG endings whatsoever, the graphics aren't even that much better when you see it in motion. The backgrounds are so bad they look 2D, and the grass that was touted to ""swing in the wind"" on Eddy Gordo's stage look flat and motionless, like the trees in Mario 64.As for the ""tag"" feature, it is implemented in a horrible fashion. Unlike every other tag game, in this one the first character that dies, the WHOLE MATCH is over. Your second character doesn't jump in. It is absurd!The game is simply outdated, the motion capture looks stiff, the control system is clunky, and it brings nothing new to the genre...and to add insult to injury, Namco declined to add even half of the options they included in their Dreamcast port of Soul Calibur.Get Dead Or Alive 2: Hardcore instead, or Soul Calibur on Dreamcast"
3,"Gorgeous, but dull.","Tekken Tag is, graphically, the most beautiful console game I've ever played. The backgrounds are deep and kinetic, and the character models are realistic and detailed. Unfortunately, it's just another fighting game; deeper than Mortal Kombat and shallower than Street Fighter. I find it a great graphics demo to show off my new PS2, but playing it bores me quickly."
3,An average fighter worth it to any fan of the series,"You can yell at me, you can scream at me, but I apologize, i cannot call Tekken Tag Tournament and above average game. This game seems to have been able to make the already traditionally clunky Tekken controls even more awkward, and pales in comparison to the amazingly fluid VF4 controls. If not for the mediocre controls, and the lack of fluidity that has become known to the Tekken series(the one exception would be Tekken 4), this game would be much better and may even merit a 5. Give this game a rental and buy it if you are a Tekken fan, but stay away if you aren't a true fan of the fighting game genre."
5,i nearly mess myself everytime i play this,Namco this is the best fighting game EVER!!! This game adds all of the tekkan stars into on battle royal and all of the different modes adds a completely new and high repaly value.I am no were near the best but i dont have to be this game levels the playing field with the new combo system.I Love Namco
5,My opinion on Tekken Tag Tournament,"Simply, Tekken Tag Tournament is the best game so far for the Playstation 2. I've played it a million times. Sure some people say it's just like Tekken 3, 2 words.... It's NOT. With returning characters from Tekken 2 and Tekken 3, I think game will go to the top!"
5,Tekken Tag is cool!,This game has awesome graphics. You can get new fighters by beating the unknown fighter. The best feature of this game is when you play the tag game. This lets you and one of your friends challenge against each other or challenge the computer.
4,Where's the Dragon guy and Dr. Bosconovitch?,"After Tekken 4 this is my favorite Tekken game. But it's basically Tekken 3 with almost every fighter from the first 3 games (excluding for some reason that Dragon thing and I can't remember is name and Dr. Bosconovitch) And get some friends together and play Tekken Bowling. It's extremely addictive and a big improvement over T3 and T4's Tekken Force Mode! The only real downside to this (and why it's 4 stars instead of 5) is that the end boss sucks ass! ""Unknown"" as she/it is called is just another Mokujin but looks like Nina with a Big Wolf beside her copying all her moves. A big dissapointment considering the greatness that was Tekken 3's boss, Ogre. All in all though a very good game but could have been better."
5,TEKKEN TAG ALL THE WAY,"Aight the game itself had MANY real life styles of fighting (should know most of my family does korean style figthing) Hworang and 2 others used this style to the TEE very good graphics.. Yes much like the others but still Tekken 1, 2, and 3 were AWESOME this just adds the the legend... DEFINATLY a must have... havent played DOA 2 though.... TEKEN TAG is a really great game and the fighting styles are based on real life styles i give it a definate 5 STARS!"
4,Great Watch,It's a beautiful and great watch. Looks even cooler in sunlight. The only complaint I have is with the way Amazon shipped the item. They just sent the watch in a plastic bag inside of a box and that's it.
2,DO NOT LAST MORE THAN 2 WEEKS!,"I was very exited to receive this item for my master bathroom, however it only worked for 2 weeks at best!I would even say the nice smell catcher was starting to go away after 1 week and the gelly inside started to shrink immediatelyYes it's cheap but not worth it! I wish it would have worked 60 days like advertize, it would have been a great item."
2,Save your money if you want an air freshener,"I have used Damp Rid for moisture removal before and the products work well but this really doesn't work as good as I thought it would. I thought while removing odors it would provide the smell of berries as well, or some smell. In reality, it smells when you open it but the smell does not fill the room at all. I;m not talking like a plug in or one of those warmed oil warming units, it just doesn't add a scent to the room at all. For the price, just get regular damp rid and use a warming unit like glade plug ins or air wick unit which actually does scent the air."
4,READY TO RUMBLE ROUND 2,"I had bought this game thinking it would be mostly for the kids but i dident like it on the dream cast but i bought it anyways and ya know what its a great fighting game has a lot of humor ,funny and takes skill to play but if you like alot of blood and gore this game aint for you."
1,Waste of time,This is the first time I read a book from Oprah's book club. Oprah was raving about this book during the book discussion show so much that I had to read this. I hated the two characters Kathy and Lester. I cannot believe people can make such bad choices. They both are such losers that they deserve each other. Oprah said 'you will not believe the ending'. The rest of the book is so badly written that I can believe the ending - equally bad. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this cheesy crap.
2,"Love, misdirected and misguided","I am in agreement with the former reviewers who felt the book was very depressing. I know that Oprah (or her staff) chooses books where readers might learn something. Well, I learned something.......not to take Oprah's picks as law. There was absolutely nothing to look forward to in this book. Although, it was well written, everyone had a self-destructive life. I had particular distain for Kathy (who we were to believe was a recovering alcholic, but don't believe what you read, folks). She was just sad, plain and simple, with no redeeming qualities. I had hope for Behrani, but the love of his own country & the yearning for his former military life was an accident waiting to happen. I had great compassion for Behrani's wife & son. I had no compassion whatsoever for the policeman who played a pivotal role in the destruction of so many lives. Don't buy the book; it's a waste of money and if you're just a little depressed today, it'll send you over the edge."
4,You won't be likely to forget this book.,"This book was interesting from the first paragraph. True to form, Oprah has picked yet another dark story of dysfunctional people. This book was different because there were two main characters- both on a collision course with each other. There were times I didn't care for the characters- that is their actions, thoughts, and motives. This is particularly true of Kathy and Lester. But like them or not, they were fascinating and unpredictable people. There were times when I didn't like the view Dubus paints of how we treat foreigners- maybe it was too close to the truth to be comfortable. But it was a compelling portrait. This was a real page turner. This book was shocking at times. I would have never guessed how things were would progress to the the utter chaos of the end of the story. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished it. I'd recommend it."
1,Couldn't even get into it. Keep thinking it will get better.,I usually love the books Operah suggests but I can't get past 30-40 pages.
3,Definitely not a light-hearted look at life,"I have mixed emotions about this book, but I think that is what the author intended. I cannot say I particularly enjoyed reading it. But, it impacted me in its bleak portrayal of the main characters.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is hoping to be uplifted. To approach this book, you should probably be in a bad mood, looking to make yourself feel either worse about the world or better about yourself because your life is not as bleak as the lives of the characters.When I put this book down, I definitely was not feeling particularly happy. But, I cannot say the book was not well written or that I was not better off for having read it. I suppose that, despite myself, I may have learned a thing or two.If you're in the mood for a depressing commentary on society and life, this is your book."
3,Captivating journey into madness,"""House of Sand & Fog"" was my bookclub's monthly selection & I was captivated within the first pages....how could a naive, confused young lady lose her only inheritance through foreclosure?? How could a likeable foreign officer establish himself in America's (especially California's) tough economy?? I empathized with each & was spellbound by their downward spiral into madness. An unforgettable read....I loved this book!"
3,"slow to start, great finish.","I think the book takes too long to develop the characters, but once it does the story is excellent."
2,Sad ending,"The House of Sand and Fog was another of our bookclub books. This one was true to my experience with the Oprah selections: interesting reading, but certainly not uplifting. In fact, it was full of tragic characters who spiral out of control into disaster. The story was a little by slow at parts, yet the ploy was very unique and the character development was interesting."
2,NO ENDING....... AGAIN!,"Dubus has a definite talent for spinning the English language into an almost compelling tale. The characters can draw you in, you get set up for an exciting conclusion, the crescendo builds.....then nothing. I felt like someone tore the last few pages out of the book. I'm not surprised, though. He does the same thing with every story in Dancing After Hours. Big build up, no payoff. A note to Oprah's Book Club, try a bit harder."
4,Competing dreams lead to tragedy,"It starts with a bureaucratic mistake, escalates into a power struggle, and ends in tragedy. Three people want the same thing - a better life for themselves - but can't see a way to achieve it without denying the others their dreams. Actions taken as a result of impulse and poor judgment are compounded by further actions and reactions. Dubus changes perspective regularly throughout the novel, revealing each character's back story, dreams and motivations. My only complaint is with the ending ... I recognize why, at the end of the book, Dubus gave each character an opportunity to reflect on what had happened, but I still wish it had ended about 30 pages earlier."
1,House of Sand and Fog,I was very disappointed in this book. I felt it was shallow writing and frankly surprised it was on Oprahs list for good reading. Half way through I was bored and thumbed through the rest of the book and got the jist of the story. Reminded me of a soap opera. Swearing and sexual feelings/fantasies don't fall into my category of good reading/literature.
1,worse book I have read in a long time,"I chose this book because of the description of it as 'unbearable suspense' and thought it would be a nice summer read. Anyone reading these reviews knows the storyline: main character , Kathy Nicolo, is evicted from her home erroneously because of tax office error (a simple response to the volumes of mail she received from tax office before everything escalated would have avoided all).Don't want to give away the plot, but although the author gives realistic description of scenes and internal diaologues, I was mostly put off by the continuous self indulgent, self absorbed main characters. What kept me going through the 364 pages was the thought that there was some unforeseen twist at the end that had you re-evaluating the whole story, or raised consciousness in the characters. Instead it was an intertwined path to what could only lead to total destruction."
3,Ring of truth slowly lost...,"When I first started reading this book I was immediately drawn into each of the 2 main characters. I could easily identify with each of them. As the story intensified so did my feelings. In fact, the author did so well that as I read from each person's standpoint I was swayed back and forth to their respective argument. I loved it. Then, suddenly, this ring of truth to which I was identifying lost something...and something more. I went from seeing where each was coming from..and how I could easily do the same things to saying ""Yeah, right"" to myself as I read further. All actions and reactions became, in my opinion, grossly exaggerated to the point of becoming completely unbelievable. This, to me, made the story lose it's appeal. I give it 3 stars for a great beginning and what could have been a marvelous plot."
1,Skip Movie Too,"Pretty good tragedy especially if you buy into the(false) premise that America is communist with respectto peoples homes. The reality being that most""homestead laws"" are so powerful that even mortgagecompanies have a hard time kicking people out...it isessentially impossible for a county to do what isdescribed in the book and shown in the movie."
2,great read until the end....which made me ILL,"I wish I hadn't read this book. I suppose this may be construed by some as evidence of a great author....who has IMPACT on his audience. I did enjoy this book until near the end, where everything falls apart and violence takes over. I'm sorry...if I'd KNOWN about the utter chaos of the ending, I'd not have ever started. Some may enjoy books which make them feel ILL at the end....I do not."
1,Sorrowful,"At first I thought the book was very good reading, gloomy (no happiness at all) but still good reading. The ending turned me against the book totally. I was very upset by it and very mad. The writer could have done so much more with this. I will definitely never read any other books by him. On a scale of one to five, I gave it a three until the end which brought it to a one. How sad."
3,Simply Unbelievable,"I enjoyed the opening pages of this book - the descriptions of life in a Persian household, the paradox of a man who's living in a $3,000/month apartment working as a garbage ""soldier"". But by the middle of the book I found it bogging down in repetition and lifeless scenes between Lester and Kathy. I thought the writing was weak and the climax simply unbelievable. Sensitive, caring, ethical Lester enjoying poking a gun under the chin of a man who had basically done nothing to him? His repeated thoughts in the car that he wished Esmail didn't have to be involved in this seemed like a thinly veiled attempt to show his compassionate side, even while he held the family hostage under a gun. It just didn't connect for me.While I found the book hard to put down, I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone else."
1,Very disappointing.,"Being a Persian, and also having liked many of Oprah's selections, I was so excited to read this. Let me just say that this was truly one of the worst books I have read in a LONG time. None of the characters are particularly likeable or to be respected. I cannot believe that this has been recommended by Oprah, and because of this, I will not be reading any more books that she recommends. In all fairness, the first part of the book is very good, Dubus even does a fairly good job with the Persian culture. But my recommendation is to never read Part II, and to come up with your own ending. There are bad endings .... and then there are bad endings. And this was just dreadful. Really, really upsetting. And no, that should not encourage you to read it and find out how bad could it really be?"
3,"Page turner, gripping last 100 pages, disappointing ending","Andre Dubus, III is an excellent writer. His description of people's intermost feelings and beliefs was gripping. Though overall, I liked the book I am not a person who likes to read sex scenes and this book had more than enough for me. I do wish Oprah would let her audience know before they buy the book how she would rate it. Otherwise, I enjoyed the character development and a look into another culture that I had never seen before. The ending was a a page burner except I felt let down when the loose ends were not as neatly tied up, as I had expected they would be. Overall, I think the book is worth reading yet I wouldn't rate it as one of the best books I have ever read (as Oprah did)."
2,Suspense less,I have read alot on my own but have enjoyed Oprah's picks. She really played up the suspense and I didn't find any.
3,The house is man's own castle,"I have not choosen to read this book because it was picked by Oprah in her book club. My reason for picking this book for read was the base storyline.Immigrant from Middle East buys the house of the dysfunctional American young woman, on auction. The young woman's personal problems stay in the way of her leading normal and responsible life. The two opposite worlds collapse as it becomes obvious that one clerical error leads to the chain of events that one cannot expect at all. Written from two perspectives (immigrant's and young woman's) this story is compelling from start to finish. And even though it is obvious that there will be not winners in this story, that will not stop any reader to finish the book. The end of this story is totally, totally unpredictable."
1,Unbelievable,"Although this book is well written, I found it to be unbelievable and I didn't like ANY of the characters. I was glad to get through it so I could move on to almost anything else!"
2,In the ruts and muck of humanity,"A woman in the habit of carelessness loses her house via county auction and a hardworking immigrant gets a bargain. Hey, can't we work something out? Not really. While Andre Dubus III takes his readers into the minds of Massoud Behrani, Kathy Nicolo and her hopeless lover Lester Burdon, he also sticks us in a rut that's knee-deep in self-deception, selfishness, prejudice. Face your demons, people! (Umph, it doesn't even dawn on them.) If that's the point, a work well done. The story is a downward spiral filled with characters who are always asking, 'why me?' and never looking beyond the muck of sand and fog. Massoud, Kathy and Lester work up a frenzy that gives humanity a black eye. While a few peripheral characters share tiny moments of kindness, their portrayals are left in the dust. The story left me agitated . . . albeit affected by how ugly we can be. -DJO'B"
2,Received damaged book,"I was very unhappy opening my package. I knew I was purchasing a used book but have always gotten what is described. I didn't see anything telling me there was water damage, stains creases and torn covers. It was not worth the price and I will never buy from this person again."
3,Ugh! Yuck and Puh! -- yet well-written,"This book is indeed a page-turner. It is enthralling and difficult to put down. It is well-written, and the characters are believeable and engrossing. I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other. The book does draw you in. However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss. My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible (which they most certainly are.) My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable. And really, I should have known. The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated. So, this was a good book. But take heed: there is no happy ending here. Nothing to feel good about. No hope at all. None. So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read."
5,A New Favorite!!!,"After I read ""House of Sand & Fog"",... I thought this novel was very good and enjoyed that it was narrated by two characters. It has become a new favorite of mine--one I recommend to all of my friends. It was such an intricate, beautiful story. Mr. Dubus has a great talent at describing things beautifully and making a story delicious.This book just offered to me things I had never thought of before.The ending was so surprising and well done. Yes, I thought this book was very good and deserving of five stars."
2,"Bad Characters, Bad Decisions","The characters in this book are not strongly depicted. There is a lack of evidence to support what motivates them to make the horrendous decisions that they do. The reader doesn't develop an appreciation for any of the characters' values, which makes it hard feel anything other than disgust with respect to the decisions that they make. I have no idea why this book is so highly regarded, awarded and recommended. I found it to be a complete waste of time."
2,I don't like these people,A story about unlikable people is tough going. I've read the other negative reviews and they all put it more eloquently than I can - these characters just aren't likable so who cares what happens to them?
1,UGH!,"Dubus is for the most part a great storyteller but has redefined the term ""fiction"" with this storyline! With the unrealistic plot of a former druggie's house being sold as a result of an error in clerical work, he forces the reader to feel nearly nothing towards his protagonist, ""Kath"" and the supposed antagonists, this innocent Middle Eastern family who uses the opportunity of purchasing the ""seized"" house to better their lives in the States. The ""book"" begins to run like a made for TV movie with its lame and depressing ending! New definition for UGH!"
1,Waste of money,"I found this book to be extremely depressing. I only stayed with the story to see who would get the house, but only to find such a depressing end. I believe Mr. DuBois had his head in the fog too long. I'm sorry I wasted a beautiful summer day on such a gloomy book. Save your money."
4,Fascinating Change of Pace,"What a wonderful style this writer uses to slowly but steadily build the pace of suspense. I was quickly absorbed by the entanglement of cultural differences, long-standing prejudices and extraordinary ignorances that ultimately culminate in a modern day tragedy of Greek proportions. I look forward to reading more by this writer."
4,A very cool compilation,"There is so much Motown music that has never been heard...it's a real treat to get just a taste of it. Hearing other Motown artists cover Motown songs makes you wonder what circumstances caused one version to be released over another. Some tunes are a carbon copy of the hit, some take a totally different turn. Let's hope that since the actual name of this disc is ""Ultimate Rarities Vol 1,"" more volumes are not far behind."
3,Not a Biography,"Though skimming through this book may make you think it is a yet another a biography of a multiple, this isn't so. Though the story of Toby is central to the work, this book covers the lives of other multiples as well. The unifying factor is the doctor they share, one newly introduced to the concept of multiplicity. Although he seems fairly married to the ideas of trauma-related multiplicity and the necessity of integration, he is very open-minded about learning more about the ""disorder,"" something that cannot be said for many therapists. The major plus of this book is the historical overview it gives to multiplicity in terms of how it has been dealt with clinically. For that alone, multiples may find it worth seeking out, especially if they are writing their own books."
1,Terrible,I got this for my son for Christmas and the instructions to put the thing together are impossible to follow. The colors don't match what comes in the box and it jumps with pictures of large portions of it put together already.
1,Horrific,"I normally do not comment when I dislike a product. However, this is (I am currently attempting to eat one) so horrible I just had to.First of all, the directions to add a cup of water... that fills the bowls mostly up, and the microwave time as given doesn't properly cook the noodles (yes I started with very hot water to begin with). Even when cooked more, the texture of the noodles reminds me of rubbery spaghetti. The noodles are wheat, so this could be expected, but it is still very unappealing.The included sauce is bland to the point of being tasteless (it does have a mildly spicy aftertaste though).Finally, and most horribly, I can taste the plastic leaching out of the container into the noodles and sauce. This is just unacceptable.I will give credit to this bowl for having a better selection of dried vegetables than others I've eaten; they are in fact quite good.Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss."
5,Great History lessons,"This video features recreated battle scenes featuring specific arms used by the U.S. during times of war, from the Civil War to Vietnam. The heroic actions of Medal of Honor winners are summarized. Interviews of Medal of Honor winners are included."
3,Too bad there were not footnotes,I am currently researching source material for a book on the construction of Notre Dame Stadium. This book has a lot of really great material and while I have read most everything written on the Rockne Era there were several anecdotes that were described here that I had never heard or found before. It would have been much better if I could know what were the sources was for the stories. The description of Rockne's Funeral and death were well written and made me feel like I was there. The author really gave you the feeling of the man underneath the legend. It also showed you that in the roaring twenties how big this man actually was. The real man was bigger than the legend.
4,Very Good Game,"I just started this game last night for the first time. I am enjoying it a good deal. :)Graphics: Great!Controls: Good, but my only huge complaint is that I really wish that you could use the joy stick. :/Camera: Same as Resident evil games, which is fine but, I kind of wish I had a little control.Combat: Terrific! I love the lock on button. Makes fighting multiple enemies easy and smooth.Story: Yep! :)Dubbing: Terrible and laughable!! LOL I HIGHLY recommend playing this game in Japanese with English subtitles. :DOverall: Great! I recommend it! ^_^"
4,really good game with some flaws,ok first of all the controls are in a word really badother than that on an epic scale this game gets a four for story line which is incredible by the way
4,Half & Half,I give this game 4 stars. It is one of the better games I have played on the PS2. It doesn't have much competion at this point but as of now I think it is the best survial-horror game on the PS2. The new Resident Evil has got pretty damn good to beat Onimusha. It has great graphics a good story plot and good sound effects not great but good.The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because it is too short and my 6 year old brother could figure out the puzzles. If you are a hardcore Resident evil fan like I am this game won't even put up a fight.
3,i am lost in boredom,"its a great game but after the game is ended you dont want to play it again ""and that funny costume is pathetic"""
3,overal ok,bland story save the princess.u might get paronoid u will feel like ur in the game even when ur not playing it which can be a bad thing.bad controls and camera.confusing at times.but its a fun game overall beat these zombies to death and when there down u can stick ur sowrd in them which is a good affect.if ur not into survival horror then u might not be able to play it all the time cause its not one of those games u can put it in and play when u dont feel like it and have fun(like gta).If u liked resident evil and think sorwds are cool this is a must have. But i cant recommend it to everyone.
4,?????????????,I like the game alot its cool weapons and magic good game play and a good chalenge i got killed alot when i started i just dont like the monsters that jump every where
5,Best 1 player game for Ps2,"This is most definetly one of the best single player Ps2 games available. It is not just a hack/slash game (though it has plenty of that). Onimush allows for weapons upgrade, varying special attacks, puzzles, and a secret at the end of the game if 20 pieces of a certain item are found. Not to mention the great graphics and AI that the Ps2 has to offer. Onimusha delivers it all. The controlls are a little cumbersum at first, but once you get the hang of it there is nothing stopping your blade. The only drawback is that it could be longer (I would take away one star for its shortness, however, it deserves 5 for game play). Other than that it is a well rounded, fun game with an enthraling story-line, and great opening movie. Great to rent or buy."
3,rent it,Do not buy this game. Take a day off and rent it. It only takes 8 hours to solve. Graphically impressive.
4,Wow,"This is a great game but it is not that inovative there is one lv where you just smash buttons. but it is a great game i love it But, it is only 5 hours long so if you spend lots of time on a game just rent it .but it has a good replay value Onimusha 2 is on the way to so this will be good for a couple of weeks so this is a must buy or rent it is a fighting/action/adventure game it is great but I just wish it was longer..."
5,Capcom delivers a must own for PS2,This game is great. If you liked Resident Evil you'll love this game. Grapics- The Grapics are jaw dropping. The Opening CG scene is the best in any video game and at some points you belive it is real! Control- If you have played Resident Evil you will be right at home. If not it will take a couple of seconds to get use too. Gameplay- Again same as RE but with a sword. Of course their are puzzles etc. Bottom Line- This game is a must have if you have a PS2! Trust ME!
1,total garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,words cannot decribe this total failure of a game the controls are clunky the story is ultra lame and the warrior looks like a hunchback there are so many other games out there that are 100 times better then this must i say more
1,"Graphics good, game bad","Listen, I will admit that this game's graphics are just about second to none, but that's about all this game has going for it. This Samurai-type guy is on a quest to save a woman, which doesn't really take to long. Along the way you kill the same demons over and over, you have only one attack and one block. After you kill all the demons at one location, you're interrupted by more slow plot lines that actually take away from the rest of the game. The game is slow and transitions are sketchy, the controls leave MUCH to be desired, the plot is boring and rudely interrupts you. If not for the story pieces, an average gamer could easily beat this game in about an hour. ...[Save] your moolah for ANYTHING else."
4,"Great game, for what there is","This is a really great game with a good variety. The only real problem i saw is that it is short. Im talking about 8 hours if your a good gamer. The controls can be a bit difficult to get used to but after about an hour they start to flow. Great variety of moves, you can do about anything: slash stab you can even impale demons if you can get them on the ground. once you get Kaede(the female hero) who is a ninja you can jump over your opponent and slit his throat. Also if you beat the game and get an S rating you get the extra costumes which add to replay value. Who doesnt wanna see a giant panda bear with a huge sword cutting up demons.Graphics 5Story 5Controls 4"
1,False Advertising,I have an upcoming Halloween party on October 25th. I ordered this wig expecting it to look like the picture. I received the order on 10/10. I opened the package and it arrived to my house in a stringy mess. I don't care what the previous review says...there is no way picking and prodding this thing with oil sheen is going to make it appear anything like the picture. I tried calling buycostume returns 5 minutes after my order was delivered. They told me they have a no return policy on wigs. I tried explaining to them that I just received the package in the mail and never wore it. They can tell this by tracking the order (I just got it!). Now I am stuck with this crap. Buyer beware.
3,"Salesman to an end, but ok book","""No one can teach you solomonic magick like I can""Straight from the intro on page 3.From there and all the adds at the end of the book and the way this is presented... he lost me there.Please do not pretend being the best and knowing all ""the secrets""...Anyhow...the read remains enjoyable and easy to follow if you know Franz Bardon's Heavy Work.I also have doubts about the way the author talks about having ""RE-DISCOVERED"" this art (working with Black Mirror) in 1969...while arounf 1954, FRANZ BARDON published INITIATION INTO HERMETICS with all the details to work hard to use a magick mirrorand the attitude of mental emptyness...That being said, FRANZ BARDON's books are REALLY the source for REAL MAGICK.Just look into the 1st book's content...you'll be amazed...It's sure that the author know Bardon's work..."
1,This game CRASHES,"Heads up...this is one of the best games I've played, but I've never finished a session (or three slopes in a row for that matter) without the game crashing. I own ten other PS2 titles, this is the only one that has issues, so I know it isn't the console.If you can run it without porblems, it's the greatest game out there.Sorry for the bad news, folks."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"When I first put this game in my PS2 I thought that it would be really great after all of the great reviews it received. It wasn't bad or anything, but it wasn't what I expected. I didn't get comfortable with the controls for a while. If I were you I would spend my money on Cool Boarders instead."
5,"Great even for complete newbies, but challenging!","First, I must say that the graphics and speed illusion on this game are out of this world. I watched a friend play this game and nearly got dizzy sitting on the couch! I have come late to the world of video games, but even I was having a blast playing this game after a run through the ""warm-up"" routine. You use every button on the controller, but just about any combination will produce a trick so it isn't intimidating.The variety in this game should keep anyone busy for a long time to come. With eight tracks, eight riders, boards and outfits to unlock, and large trick books, it's going to take quite a while to work through everything this game has to offer."
4,"Fun, but a little unrealistic","The game is a great game with good graphics and good smooth handleing, but the courses seem to be a little wild and and have pretty much nothing to do with snowboarding. That could be a good thing or a bad thing, it depends on what the gamer wants out of the game. Some freinds of mine thought it was stupid because of all the hi-tech oppsticals on the course which made it more of a...non-hard core snowboarding game. Some people, like me liked the extra stuff they put in there, like the special move meter that when full lets you go super fast. So if your sick of the basic 180 Snowboarding game where all you do is just snowboard and do tricks get this game to pump thing up a little."
5,SSX - BEST PS2 SPORTS GAME OUT THERE!,"This is the first game I purchased for the PS2 system and it really blew me away! Graphics are unreal with very little if any pauses. Huge tracks and many characters to choose from...even 4 or 5 hidden ones. Soo much to do in this game. You can race to earn medals or bust some moves or just freeride. I already beat the game, but I just cant seem to stop playing it over and over...it is very addicting! All in all this is the greatest game ever made for the PS2 and should be in everyones collection! I HIGHLY recommed getting it! See for yourself and I am sure you will agree with me."
5,Watch out on a big screen you might get sick,"This game is amazing. The graphics are great, it is easy to play and so far I am not bored which for me is a big deal. The only problem I have with the game is that on my big screen TV (61"") the response is so quick after playing for an hour or so I get a huge headache from feeling like I am imersed in the game."
1,Huh? This was a movie?,"If you like blood, guts and bullets, you will like this movie.If you like acting, a plot and something that makes sense,Don't rent this movie.If you like some good music, buy the soundtrack.Does Willis get paid by the minute or the hour? He's overpaid."
2,Watch No Country For Old Men instead,For those of you that watch about any movie that comes out this movie will be just fine.If you're a little more picky about how you spend a couple hours of your night I would skip this movies. The director seems concerned with style more than substance. Either than or the director knew the cast he had to work with wasn't going to be able to deliver so he had to use other methods to keep the viewer's interest. There are multiple sections of the movie where a song is playing as you watch the character sit there or do mundane items. Probably high-art to some but it came across a way to sell the soundtrack.1 - part No Country For Old Men2 - Part Boogie Nights3 - Part Forrest Gump (the long music sections)4 - Part 70's drive in movie
1,Don't spend your money on this,"Thank god this was one of my free netflix deliveries. I was going to rent it for 3.00 rental at the blockbuster box at the supermarket but thank god they were out so I waited for Netflix.Expect about 15 head shots of people blown away for no reason other than to shock. Who writes this stuff? Bruce Willis must be bored because the last few films he has done are a waste. He is getting at the top of my list next to Mel Gibson that I am just not going to bother any more.So if its a free rental and you got 90 minutes to WASTE go for it but don't buy this.The only good part is the range of character that Forrest W pulls through and that is the only, and I repeat only worthy part of this."
1,omg...so bad!!!,This is one of the worst movies in a long time. Basically just a whole movie of the F word and then shooting people.
2,Awful,"If you find yourself wondering why you haven't really heard of this movie before despite the rather star-studded cast, it's simply because this tedious hyper-violent, expletive-laden mess of a film that attempts to ape Tarantino yet lacks the skill, script-writing ability, or panache to pull it off, is indeed awful. I found myself not only not caring about the three heist planning girls, but actively disliking all three. Furthermore, despite being predominately placed on the cover of the DVD, Bruce Willis, indeed the sole reason I choose to watch this film in the first place, is woefully underused. Even for die hard Willis fans (pun not intended) this film is a miss"
2,"Creative editing, but weak plot","This movie falls into the category of everything being good except the story sadly. The camerawork was great - cool angles, well framed shots, etc.; same for audio, atmospherics and even (mostly) acting. Sadly however, the story was not good at all, and borders on incoherent. As you watch this film, it feels like an exercise in who can be the most incentive member of the team, except the screenwriters, so you end up with an artificially, somewhat over the top film that lacks meaningful substance. It reminds me of Guy Ritchie - IMHO Lock Stock and Snatch are brilliant stories and very creative camerawork and editing, but his later movies had everything the same minus the stories. So it is here. Its an ok watch if you're bored, just don't expect the story to have any meaningful impact."
1,If you can't get to sleep.......,Watch this movie. It is very very slow! I tried to watch the movie 3 times and fell asleep at the same point each time. The acting is sub par and the script is dull and predictable. I would not advise this one.
3,"Some good scenes but,","Despite the feeling that you have a great cast looking for a film throughout much of the running time, Catch .44 does have some genuinely tense moments. The dialogue feels forced especially at the beginning as do the licensed tunes that are clearly intended to kick the picture off and instead just play over scenes instead of every being part of them. The women in the cast all do good work and Bruce Willis is fine in his small role. The movie only has a couple riveting scenes and they both involve Forest Whitaker's character. I felt myself grimacing as this is a very derivative film in many respects, I wouldn't even call it homage. The cast does a good job of rising above the material especially Woll and Whitaker."
2,Have to agree,"I'm with most of the reviewers here. Catch .44 relied too much on cool music, talented actors, and Tarantino aesthetics. What it really needed, and most definitely did not have, was a spectacular script. Instead, we got ""just good enough"". A few interesting moments, but lame overall.By His loathsome tentacles,Venger As'Nas SatanisIpsissimusCult of Cthulhu"
1,awful,i normally like bruce willis but will never buy a film with him as featured artist again. This one was so bad i put it in the garbage right away as I did not want to inflict this on anyone.
5,The Story Girl is one of L.M. Montgomery's greatest books!,"I love this book! I read it just recently,and I could barely put it down! The Story Girl is one of L.M.Montgomery's greatest books! I can't believe it's out of print! I hope someday I'll be able to own it. If you haven't read it yet, you MUST find a way to. It is a GREAT book!"
3,"Wonderful story, though the book itself fell apart.","I am a huge fan of L.M. Montgomery and I enjoyed this story immensely. However, this particular publishing was not well made. I ordered it brand new and read it as I do all other books, but many many pages just fell out as I read it. By the time I was finished, there were chunks of pages that had fallen out and been set aside and I ultimately ended up disposing of it. I love the story, but recommend a different edition of the book than the August 2000 printing."
3,"Works, but not correctly",I purchased this card along with the matching access point. I am running XP PRO on an inspirion 8200. It worked right out of the box by justing sliding it in. However none of the indicator lights work. There is a data light and a power light that never come on. My range is decent not great. I may send it back even though it seems to work.
5,look no further for beat driven reggae.,"I love this CD. I don't dance and this CD has me wanting to move. I have been searching for a type of reggae that I like, I found it. Not one bad track. If you think you like Lee Perry and Bob Marley, this is different. You will hear ""roots music"" in a bold style.TURN IT UP like it's supposed to be played."
4,"great but, 4 stars only, though.","I just received the fragfx yesterday and spent all day playing with it. tweaking and fine tuning. also I updated to the current v3.0 successfully.There is some minor issued after i installed the current update. before the update i was able to throw grenades propperly in socom. now, i can't even throw it over head with the sixaxis titling. also clicking the mouse button(r2)can be unresponsive at times. besides that it plays great with other fps games. also using rapid fire for AR or pistol is so much fun.My main problem is i'm a lefty. but, i'm trying to overcoming this dilemma by using my right hand more when handling a mouse. what a pain in the @ss. ohwell...*edit...i got to fix the problem from socom throw grenades by reinstalling the driver. and the mouse button unresponsive problem can be fix by D/L from splitfish tweak utility and adjusting the mouse buttons sensitivity so, you don't have to press very hard."
5,might have been fun,"I never really used this item. It was stolen out of my house along with my PS3 and all the games. looks like it would work good tho, better than the stupid game controller"
2,Cheap quality,"Pros:-GREAT CONCEPT-Software upadates-Customizable button layoutCons:-The whole controller feels cheap its not very well made.-Useless mouse pad-Mouse movement feels choppy even after i updated the firmware and tried to adjust the sensitivity settings in the game and on the controller-The buttons require you to push hard in order to respond and sometimes this can be annoying specially in the middle of multiplayer COD4 match.I tried fixing this problem by using the application from the Splitfish website but this is just another annoyance us the consumers shouldn't have to fix on a ""finished"" product.Overall I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this controller it lacks quality and polish, if in the future Splitfish releases a high qulity version of this product i will definitely check it out."
2,No replacement for keyboard and mouse,"Unfortunately, I fell for the hype. I followed all the instructions and configured this as best I could, but it simply fell short of being able to compare to a keyboard and mouse. I should have listened to my own advice to stay away from FPS on consoles."
1,unplug the dongle when updating cause the dongle become dead,unplug the dongle when updating cause the dongle become dead.Everything i try it doesnt help ..wut a waste of $104.
2,Not the same as a true Keyboard and Mouse,"This was an unfortunate upset. The controller is a constant struggle to get the sensitivity correct and unfortunately since the mouse is mimicking a joystick there is certainly something lost in translation with what seems to be all games.My theories at this epic failure are:Mouse is too low DPI? Turning up or down the sensitivity in the game (particularly COD) or on the controller simply makes the movements either extremely jerky or extremely slow. The mouse questioned me to whether I really did play with an inverted Y axis, even after 12 years of FPS games.Mouse buttons are as smooth to click as a 67 year bikers bum. If you manage to crawl up on the target, get it in your sights it will take about 50 lbs of pressure to pull that trigger pushing you off target by a quarter mile.The mouse pad blows.I think in time, you could get used to the rig. It is though... Not a mouse and keyboard replacement."
2,The best part of the film is its premise,"As the best thing about LISA is its keen premise, I don't even want to reveal it. If only the rest of the movie were that clever. LISA held my attention because I kept hoping its conclusion would reflect the wit of the setup but instead it wraps up with the too-usual rock 'em sock 'em inanity of these psycho-killer films. Too bad, as LISA wastes the talents of Staci Keanan, Cheryly Ladd and especially the ever-stalwart Jeffrey Tambor."
4,Very Kewl CD,"I like this CD; it is very fluid. Trance is soo awesome, and this is the fantabulous beginning to a set of three Tunnel Trance Force Americas. They are all so good. Tunnel Trance Force America 2 is by far the best... but if you like this, get the other two. If you like either of the other two, then definitely invest in this one! Or buy it used; it's the way to go! : )"
5,incredible resource,"I sing, play guitar, write music, and I am currently diving deep into classic country and old-time music from the 1930s-1950s. This is a great collection, well packaged, with good (sometimes very good) liner notes and historical background information. It will be an incredible resource for me for the rest of my life. Don't believe the complainers who moan about the packaging scratching the CDs in this collection --- that has not happened to me once."
5,Nice watch for a good price,"The watch is very nice, my husband loves it, works perfectly and can't find any negative thing to say about this watch.Nice watch for a good price"
5,Great and Stylish,Looked better in person than it did online. Son love the gift and he is 14yrs old. I think i might get one for myself.
3,Nascar 2001ps2,Well it is Clear to me that this was a rush job.The graphics could have been much better.This version lost alot of the good stuff.No sound on the replay.The pit stop and the garage options are lost.I was disapointed.Overall i enjoy the game but it could have been so much better.
3,Tusken Raiders?,"Pretty good concert. If you're a fan, I recommend it. If you're not a die-hard fan though, you could probably skip it. For the record, however, the roadies are dressed as Jawas, not Tusken Raiders ..."
3,"Too Much Show, Too Little Neil Young","This is an interesting look back at Neil Young when the band Crazy Horse was still around. The sound quality is not great, but the major distraction is the ""show!"" What I wanted was Neil Young and Crazy Horse on stage playing and singing. What I got was a bunch of goofy Star Wars characters running around. I didn't hear any of them say ""ooteeni,"" but I'll bet they did. It is too bad Neil Young thought he needed this distraction in his performance."
4,Cordless Screwdriver,Great product! Battery lasts fair for it's size. The clutch is nice to have too.
3,Trying to learn Polish,"Bought this boopk to try to relearn, and teach my Granddaughters, a bit of Polish. I was hoping for a basic text book but this book is geared for the traveler. I am sure that anyone planning a trip to Poland will find it useful but for teaching its use is limited."
1,how lame,"For me, this book's highlight was the local color. Characters used the word ""innit,"" as in ""I were in the kitchen, innit?"" I kept practicing until I could pronounce it without adding a 'd.'Then one of the characters pronounced it ""idnit."" --DOH!Another reviewer has said that ""the denouement is quite contrived and ultimately disappointing."" Judge for yourself: The killer sends some postcards to his buddy in prison with pictures of the town he's in. But the cops can't find him until he calls the local police station and tells them where he is. Then he's amazed when they show up and bust him!Mr Harvey, yer head is up yer arse, innit?"
2,Ummm gay,A 6 year old almost flawlessly beat me because he can push buttons faster than me. They could have put Street Figher 2 from supernintendo onto cd and been better than this game.....goodnight!
3,i good game but could use a little more,my friend rented this game and my friend said it was sweet so i decided to check it out i rented and in a hour i had beaten the game. no prob plus i wasn't to happy with it either the only reason i went on playing is out of sheer bordem. the graphics r so-so and the fights can be very predictable if you have my opinion buy tekken tag tournament you'll get your moneys worth at least.
2,This is only good when friends are around. PERIOD.,"Listen, anyone who can play Street Fighter halfway decently can finish this game in under an hour. I rented it one day and finished it in 15 minutes. Not only was it over in 15 mins, but it had the WORST ending i've EVER seen. And no, it wasn't on an easy difficulty, it was on the hardest setting! I'm not that great but this game was 0 competition.The ONLY thing GOOD about this game is fighting with a buddy. Chun Li is my favorite cause she's just psycho in here. This is the game's ONLY saving grace. If not for this it would have gotten 1 star.So if you will never have to play this alone, go ahead and get it... USED. For solo play, save your money."
1,Oh My God,"This game is terrible. The graphics look like a rgular playstation game. Fighting the computer is like fighting a soiled napkin. This game is by far the worst of the launch titles. Street fighter will be forever tainted. Capcom, for shame!"
1,sucks not suction!,"Does not stick on my stainless steel sinks either. The only other reviewer stated that it did not stick to a porcelain sink, and I even tried it on glass, ceramic and marble and still it did not stick. So what does it stick to... the only that gets stuck is the buyer!"
4,Nice collaboration of multiple artists,"Mixed instrumental/vocal CD. Reminiscent of forrest gump soundtrack, joshua kadison style, rustic instrumentals. Seemingly weak production on some tracks. Overall interesting instrumental/contemporary collaboration. Nice for the price, some cuts are worth the cost of the album alone, very beautiful. Would give this a 3.5 stars, so am putting it a 4."
3,fun ....but,"the graphics are bad and maybe it was just the cd I got, but the game always seemed to lag. For the first couple of rounds the games fun then it just becomes repetative and boring"
3,Same game as last,I like it but it was the same as the first one it had same fighting and only had new levels and characters it was just like the first one in adventure and gets boring after a while.
4,Up right Arcade comes to the PS2,"I first played this at our truckstop arcade, after that when I found out they had it on the PS2 I went nuts, it's wonderful and if you have a multi-tap a damn good party game, while it's no longer 'printed' I love playing as often as possible with as many friends as I can, and if you each make a file name whenever everyones not around you can still power up YOUR character, there are a total of 16 warriors with male/female equals. 8 Basic and then 8 more that you have to unlock that are powerful forms of the first ones. My personal Favorites are the Wizard/Soceress and the Archer. Their more powerful forms are fun too, but I won't tell what they are. ;D getta copy and find out for yourself"
1,BORING,"First of all this game has some of the worst graphics on the PS2. I often found myself shooting my own partner in multi play because all the creatures look the same. Also, the levels are best described as flat, boring, and linear, with absolutely no challenge. The player characters and enemies are all the same with about two basic attacks each(actually the special attacks are kinda cool). Oh and the characters you can unlock through completing bonus levels are basically clones of other characters with different color clothes. Another thing that really bugged me about this game were the bosses. Usually in an RPG the bosses are imaginative, unique and challenging. But in Gauntlet if you happen to find a super ""holy"" item you instantly kill the boss. Where's the fun in that? If you really think you'll like this game please rent it first!"
4,"very good book, almost like mary, bloody mary!","i loved this book as much as mary, bloody mary. very cool and it gave me a whole new perspective to elizabeths life instead of some horrible, evil person (which is totally not her), she was struggling w/ her life and her sister, the 'beloved mary' was trying to kill her, just because of her mother! (if im not makin' sense, ya have to read the one before that to understand)."
3,beware of princess elizabeth,"I liked the book. I was fond of elizabeth. I did my projects on her when I had the chance, I like that she showed men who was the boss, and that she didn't need them for anything at all, Elizabeth was indepent. I would consider this book to who ever likes to hear stories about the royal familys,like I do. Elizabeth was mean when she got mad,but she never send any body to cute their heads off for pleasure."
5,Beware Princess Elizabeth,This is a book that I would recommend to everyone!You should really read this!This is also a great history book!
3,Good read,I found myself not being able to put this book down. It is my first time reading Ken Follett and I did enjoy the story & characers.
3,A fine but not great book,"I like very much Ken Follet. I have read ""The Pllars of the Earth"" and ""The third Twin"" and I had a great time reading both.This book is fine, because Ken it's a great BestSeller writer, but it lacks something. I don't know what, but I think the story is simple, and in a lot of moments very predictable.On the other hand there are several secuences in which you can't leave reading the book because they are thrilling.Ken has better books"
3,Eh... just not that great,"Things started out promisingly. Could have been good. The first third or so was passable, and the middle third not too bad either. But things really fell apart near the end. Not only did the characters only experience the growth of character that you would EXACTLY expect, but the plot and thrills themselves relied on a continually unlikely string of trivial bad luck for everyone. This simply stretched credulity too far and left me wondering why a book about viruses that could kill millions relied on such tricks to remain suspenseful.And the very ending was just trite. While I'm glad it didn't just end with chaos still strewn about, Follett seemed determined to wrap up every possible stray yarn and leave nothing to anyones imagination but his own.Read it if you've got nothing better with you, but surely better is available."
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"The first two-thirds are efficient and fast-paced. But the last 130 pages... unbelievable, and unbelievably tedious.Without compuction, four criminals steal a virus that will kill millions. They decide to do so despite a sudden increase in lab security, and despite knowing that their escape will be complicated by a blizzard. They can't bring themselves to shoot guards who learn their names, plans, and descriptions. They take a family hostage and give them more than enough information to ensure failure, capture, and conviction.Thank goodness the police are stupider than humanly possible.Follett goes to preposterous lengths to avoid shooting anybody. His villains threaten and brandish guns on every page - and then they punch and kick their victims. Over and over and over again. A hundred pages from the end, I found myself thinking, 'No criminal would ever act like that.' But they do, endlessly.By the time Whiteout is over, I regretted the complete waste of my time. Be warned."
3,Entertaining Crime Caper,"From what I understand from other reviewers, this is a departure from Follett's usual fare. Since this is the only novel of his that I've read, I can't compare it to previous books of his. Follett takes quite a bit of time developing his characters and setting the scene for this story, so it really doesn't get going until about the halfway point. From then on, it's a fast paced and entertaining read. The setting is Scotland at Christmas. A deadly virus is stolen from a research lab. The premise is not very original, but Follett puts a few interesting twists into play. A little romance, a frightening crime caper and a satisfying conclusion make for a few hours of quiet entertainment."
3,A RERUN?,"As I read this book, I kept asking myself, ""Did I read this before?"" So much of the plot, setting, and characters were a repeat of other books that I thought I was getting a regifted present. The virus theme, the family betrayal, the terrorist robbery, and the eventual resolution felt like a collage of other authors. The book was entertaining but not stellar. I am not sure I would recommend it to others to read. Sorry, Ken."
3,Not his best,"I've enjoyed a lot of Follett's previous works but had heard some bad things about this book. However, since I like Follett I wanted to find out for myself if this book was really as bad as I had heard. Basically the story takes place in a biomedical research facility in Scotland where thieves have stolen a deadly virus. A freak Christmas snowstorm strands the thieves and they make their way to the home of the research center's founder and chief scientist as his family gathers for the holidays. Typical drama ensues.It wasn't Follett's best but it wasn't as bad as I had heard either. I fyou have never read Follett before this is probably not the book to start with. However, if you are already a fan then this average book is not a total waste of time."
2,boring,Very boring and simple. The heroine was too perfect and the other characters were dull. Very predictable. I miss the cold war.
2,Follett Dials One In - Fundamentally Flawed,"I'm a fan of Ken Follett but it seems, like Miles Davis in his later years, he's just dialing it in now. The entire premise for the theft of the Madoba-2 virus is just naive at best. Follett may have visited some bio-tech firms for his research for White Out but he sure didn't do any research on basic security. What kind of high-tech company that handles a killer virus would not change access pass codes when an employee is fired. That's just stupid. There is also a ridiculous amount of filler and fluff in this book that had little to do with the actual story. I was disappointed."
2,Disappointed,This book was so predictable and lame. Big disappointment. I absolutely loved World Without End
1,Poor Effort,"Pedestrian and uninspiring. A pot boiler that misses the mark. I have read all of Follett's books and they vary greatly. I have enjoyed the last three books that he wrote but this one should never have been accepted by his editor. Try Trevanian, he is the true master of the genre."
2,Starts with such good potential only to dissapoint at the end,"I too am a Follet fan, so I bought this book without hesitation. The description in the back of the book is promising although all too common in many of the books today. A deadly virus gone amuck. Who has not written about that? I figured Follet can make it interesting.And then, the story got boring. It lost its edge half way in the middle of the book only to get worse at the end. It is as if Follet gave up on the book end decided to wrap it up with a few easy pages."
5,ONE OF MY CHILDHOOD FAVORITES,"I fondly remember this, one of my favorite books when I was little. The title alone was fun to say, and the character and premise was fun, too. I've tried for years to find a used copy, but so far with no success."
5,I've been waiting for a reprint.,"I have a well-loved original print of this book but have been waiting for years for it to be reprinted so I could buy it for friends and families. It's a fabulous story with incredible artwork. You can tell that VIP was a a cartoonist on every page. I love the colors, love the story, love the message and would recommend this to anyone."
5,About time for this classic to be reprinted,"This was a book from my childhood then my childrens, I always wanted to give them their own copy and now finally I can, thank you. We always read this book after a day of making christmas cookies."
5,This game is pretty darn good!,"Listen. I know this game hasn't come out yet, but it HAS come out in japan(why would they have an american football game in japan? dont ask me!). I played my friend's imported version of the game and it was great! First of all, the graphics were amazing. No I'm not just talking about the cutscenes, the entire game's video quality was good. Plus the PS2 port's controls were a lot easier to use than Nintendo 64's football videogames (i.e. NFL Blitz, Madden 64). This would be a great first game for your Playstation 2 collection. Just remeber to get an extra controller."
4,"Excellent, with only minor flaws. . .","The graphics and gameplay are smooth and realistic, like everyone has said. Only problems:1) Kicks are too easy to aim, but too difficult to control distance-wise. I've found that 25 yard punts are not at all uncommon.2) Almost never get pressure on QB without blitzing, as shedding blocks is very difficult . . . and without pressure, QB will pick you apart.3) QB's never over/under-throw balls, but this is made up for by a high drop-rate among receivers (especially in the flats, which is very annoying).4) Buttons are complciated and take time to feel natural.Still, extremly enjoyable and very impressive. Compared to past Madden games, this one is bug free."
1,DC,"Why would you get PS2 in the first place. I have PS2 and my bro had DC, and I highly reccomend DC. The games are 1000 times better, along with the playability. PS2 STINKS! Don't get this game, or PS2, get NFL 2K1 and DC, BELIEVE ME!"
4,Nearly Flawless,"WOW! Truly amazing graphics. It's not just the fluid movement of the players, it's the minor details. The players adjust their pads after a hit, in a dome they all throw four shadows because of the indoor lighting, the linemen drop the first down marker and run out of the way when the play comes at them, and on and on. Not to mention the depth of play, playing a season, owning a franchise, worrying about the salary cap...it's all there! Or you can just simply play FOOTBALL! The only downside I can really point out is the announcing. It's repetitive and quickly becomes annoying. Not to mention, Lesley Visser is TERRIBLE as the sideline reporter, she sounds like the VISSERTRON 2001, her line-reading is more wooden than Pinnochio. The game however, is simply to beautiful to look at and play to allow the audio to detract from it. Buy this if you want the best football game ever made."
4,flutin' and alludin',"The price tag is a bit too much for an album originally released in 1964, but the tasteful packaging and remastering almost justify the price. The music hits most of Roland's (later Rahsaan's) fortes: swinging blues, spatious and haunting pentatonic originals, appropriations of tunes from a wide body of music, including world music; and his postmodern take on jazz history. The only tune that falls flat is ""A Quote from clifford Brown"" - with an expressive artist like Kirk, straight modern bop tends to fence in the artist's talents."
1,Not happy with purchase,The product looks good but the grinding mechanism does not work properly. When I try to grind the salt it comes out in clumps. Not worth the money
2,Not clear,I purchased this item thinking it would be actual flash cards and it is not. They are pages with questions. No tear outs. The info is good but not what I was looking for or what I thought I was buying.
3,Good blade - lousy belt clip,"I received this two days ago. The knife itself appears to be just fine but the metal clip on the sheath was covered with a black powder that rubbed off on cloths, skin or anything it touched. The metal of the clip had no springiness and took a set when opened to attached to a belt. After ujsing it to attach to my belt only three times this clip snapped and is now useless. Without the clip the only place to carry this is in a pocket which is far from ideal. Replacements are sold online for this piece at anywhere from about $7.50 to a little of $10 each but having to replace this after only two days is disturbing."
1,THIS GAME WAS RUSHED!!!!!!!!!,"When the game introduction started I was thinking... ..WOW!!!! UNREAL graphics...Then I started to play the game and all of the fun stopped....It plays like a DOG!!!!! VERY Frustrating....yes you can tweak the speed.....etc.. but I did all of that and I still was frustrating..Most of all was the SLOWDOWN!!!!!!! AAAAGGGHHH!!!!! The fighting stinks too!! They obviously rushed this game out....Do yourself a favor, RENT IT FIRST!!! The people that gave this game 5 stars are crazy!!!"
3,Stunning graphics and pretty good gameplay,"This is the best hockey game I have ever seen. The graphics are amazing. Better than the playing graphics in FIFA or Madden. All the games have just stunning replay cinematic graphics, but the playing graphics in NHL 2001 for PS2 are spectacular.This game does not have a franchise mode like Madden does (at least I couldn't find it). The interace to pick teams, make players, and run a season are just terrible. Madden has a great easy to use clean menu interface and NHL 2001 has a clunky, muddy interface that is difficult to use.The game is fun to play against other people, the rumble feature of the controller works great when you get checked. If you are a hockey fan you will buy this without any regrets. If you are not a hockey fan, you will still like it and have fun, but I would recommend trying the game before you decide that you want it."
1,headache,"unconventional, but unoriginal. while i was reading i wondered how much of the disjunction and collaged word sequences he thought of himself. franky, it gave me a headache. makes a nice coaster, though."
1,Awful,I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy.
3,SGI Sutra,"You may do better with the Huvitz translation, ""Blossom of the Fine Dharma"". The Watson version seems too influenced by the Soka Gakkai, who are a bit dogmatic about the Lotus Sutra. They differ in small ways, but enough that it can obscure the message of unification the Lotus Sutra presents.This doesn't mean the Watson version isn't worth reading, just understand how skewed a translation can get, if the people involved in the translation have an agenda. By Watson's own admission in the book, the Soka Gakkai played a big role in helping create this translation.For those in the Soka Gakkai, who might take offense to my opinion of this translation of the Lotus Sutra or anything else. Realize it is only an opinion and if you take offense, come to anger, or seek to hurt me in some way. You may want to investigate what you're really gaining from the Soka Gakkai ""vehicle"" of Buddhism. I wish you all the best."
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this straight razor if you have any plans to shave your face with it. It's never going to happen. It's way to dull to shave with right out of the box and needs to be professionally honed as most new razors do. So I sent it out and paid another $25 to get it sharpened but the man who does my other razors for me said that after 4 hours of effort there was just no way to get a proper edge on it because the metal was too soft and the grind was uneven along the edge. He explained that there were a number of poor quality blades for sales that just cannot be shaved with and that this was one. He showed me others as well so I'd know what to look for. Needless to say I was very unhappy with my bargain priced razor.
5,Great for kids!!,I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughters and they loved it. They immediately took it out of the box and started scratching off the images. They had done all of them before the morning was out. It keeps them occupied for hours and they love seeing the images. Definitely worth the money!!
4,an excellent book for medical students,"A very concise book for every medical student who is beginning to touch the imaging field. Thought only 460 pages, it covers every organ system with emphasis on key features of important diseases. There is plenty of photographs with good diagrams. The text is concise and easy to read."
4,A good expandable MP3,"RCA Lyra RD2315 512 MB Personal Digital Audio Player with Voice, Line-in and FM RecordingThis is good for the person who wants an MP3 for books, and music and recording in class. most college students can tell you about that. It can hold a 2 gig sd card which are chip as chips and will hold up to about 30 LP's or CD's or it will resord for hours if you have a long class and the prof. never know it is even in the class. Most MP3 don't have the SD chips but my friends and I have been shopping around for all the one's that do. One's that hold pictures MP3, movies, music vidio's and more because we can trade then with each other and have all types music and stuff at a touch.Doyel Whited"
3,Not big enough for deep fry,It is kind of small and not deep enough for deep fry. It is much smaller than what I've seen in the picture. Maybe can use to fry eggs or pancake. It is just ok.
1,AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!,"Are you kidding me? This is music? They play one of her songs at a movie theatre near my house. It's called ""Yes"" or something and it is the sorriest excuse for music I have ever heard. This CD is someones fault, someone must be held responsible and actions MUST be taken. I am also upset with Amazon.com for making one star the lowest you can give an album. Amanda Shelby, may God have mercy on your soul and may a judge in good standing with this state never allow you to record again."
3,Better than the Ping One Down CD2,"An acceptible single compared to CD1 but still down on previous efforts.Sound of Sounds is slightly different than the album version, a bit shorter in length is about all.The live version of Ping One Down is alright, the vocals and particularly the bass drum sound very muffled, there would have to be better live versions of this song out there.Where Are Your Friends is another mellow b side (so many gomez b sides are) with Ian on vocals. Not a bad song but sounds familiar to other Gomez bsides.This single also has the video for sound of sounds which is a pretty dull video, but fitting of the song in some respects.The edit of Sound of Sounds is found on Five Men in a Hut but the other 2 songs are not, making this the only way to obtain these songs."
4,sewing machine,good product! you can tell there are some issues with it. received within 3 days of placing my order!!!
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"This product is poorly made. The inside wooded area is rough and not aligned so that the bottom drawer can slide in all the way (and therefore the small pieces continually fall out.) My niece got a splinter in her finger trying to align the drawer so that would close. Also there is not enough depth in the holes in the Chinese Checker board, causing the ""marble"" pieces to continually roll out when playing the game. Finally, the Chess pieces are made of a very lightweight cheap plastic and continually tip over while another piece is being moved. Sadly I am returning this item."
5,GREAT,"The description of the book said it was in ""good"" condition, but when I received it (only 2 days later), it didn't look like it had even been opened. Would definitely order from these guys again. Thanks"
4,Fascinating Read,"If you're reading this review, then it's probable that you read books on a regular basis. Then again, according to the NEA, the fact that you're on the internet right now is a sign of the decline of the book industry. Smokler takes on the notion of ""unreaderly times"" and presents a wealth of diverse voices from contemporary writers who tell you what it's really like to practice their craft in today's world. Their answers will surprise and intrigue you. And some of them are funny as hell."
1,NOT FOR YOUNG READERS!,"i wouldn't recommend this for any young readers. they should put a ratings on books also to tell parents what kind of stuff their kids are reading. especially books that are in the ""kids section"" of the library. awful and distasteful! watch out if you have a 10 or 11 year old reading this book.."
3,ok,"this book was ok, the first half was good, but the second half was boring, overall it was an OK book. :D"
5,Amanda ...,"In the beginning of the story Alice and Patrick are dating. Everything is going smoothly untill this girl, Penny, comes into the story. Penny is the type of girl that all the boys like, girlfriend or not. Penny wrecks their relationship with her flirting with Alices boyfriend, PatricK. Alice heard about it and didnt want to say anything about it , for he might feel like hes being nagged or bugged. Well, the third time it happened she talked to him about it and he got really mad and they broke up. i didnt want to say anything more because it would ruin the story.I liked the book a lot because it explains what a teenage girl can go through in Juinor high and high school. If i were to try to convince someone to read this book I would tell them to check it out and they would enjoy it a lot! its worth the time to read and to write the book. THE END"
5,The Alice Books,I think Alice books are a wonderful book. Many girls such as my self think that the books help them in their problems. It helps them get thourgh break ups with boys and answers childrens sex questions. Alice to me seems like a regualr person that goes through everyday life. Alice and her friends go and have fun and everyday they seem to discover something else thats new. Like what happened when a girl gets molested and diffrent things such as that. Alice books helped me get through lots of things that I thought with out the books I could never get though it. Alice breaking up with Patrick and her father getting re-maried were great parts of the series. I think if girls any age or even boys would enjoy these books. I think Naylor did a great job with the books and is a wonderful auther.
4,Very true to the description,"This chart is very basic and perfect for any grade level. I was disappointed, however, to find that the numbers are printed on thin posterboard and need to be cut apart."
4,Underrated Pistols Gem,"I think this is one of the most underrated Sex Pistols albums, it is worth it alone for the two videos that enhance the CD. It features a very good quality ""Friggin in the Riggin"", which is a must, and also includes other scarely-heard songs, even if Johnny Rotten wasn't on vocals..."
3,its okay,"I only liked the helmet because it matched the bike my niece got for christmas. It was cute because it matched the bike, I think there are a pair of roller skates too. I just like that is served as an accessory for the bike and was suppose to provide protection for the child, but the helmet turned out to be too small for her head. It fit kind of snug and she complained about the helmet not being comfortable. Overall, just because it is cute does not mean it is worth the value. She only used it twice before she completely gave up on it. The elbow and knee pads weren't comfortable either. I guess the child has to be small to fit the items comfortably, but she is only five and it didn't work for her."
1,tripe,"Mr. Lieberman is a dangerous man. Obviously well-educated (he can write), he is clever enough to fool the reader with his ability to present personal, small-minded, poorly informed opinions as facts.As a mental health professional who works with juvenile offenders, I can firmly state that Mr.Lieberman's ""facts"" are wrong,wrong, wrong. But in these sorry days of poor treatment for the mentally ill, it comes as no surprise that a self-proclaimed ""expert"" doesn't know the difference between a bonafide mental disorder and a personal choice. True recovery for those who are caught in the tangled web of the justice system and the mental health community will be harder to realize as long as books like this are foisted on the public. I ought to know - I'm on the front line."
4,Exactly the part I needed,"After spending several days of trips to different stores and making many purchases and returns, this was exactly the part I needed that I couldn't get locally."
3,COLOGNE,ARRIVED IN HUGE BOX AND WAS CHARGED SALES TAX COULD OF BOUGHT IT BUY MY HOME FOR CHEAPER DO NOT BUY NOT WORTTH MONEY
3,cologne,it looks totally legit but there is something funny about the smell. it still smells good but doesnt seem to be a strong as the bottles at the mall. maybe thats why it was so cheap. maybe a stale batch or something.
1,Rip off!!!!!,They sent a bottle half the size as discribed. They have done nothing to correct the mistake!!!!! I have emailed them over a month ago and have been waiting patiently for another bottle to be sent. I've emailed twice since then and have gotten 0 responses. Complete rip off!!!!
1,never got the item ! fail !,I never got this item .. just got lost in the mail :( . I think Perfume Emporium sold the item. Totally unprofessional. never even got an apology . Will never buy perfumes again on amazon . period.
1,not even close!!,I order this product thinking I was getting Acqua Di Gio. After smelling the the same name product in a store this product is'nt even close!!! Very unhappy!
1,Bad Impression,I've used this product for about 15 years but this was the first time that I buy it from Amazon.I think there is something wrong in its originality cause there are two different Barcode on thepocket and the bottom side of the glass!
2,smells old,some perfumes get that been sitting on the shelf too long smell and that is exactly how this smelt as soon as i got it. would not buy from this seller again.
2,Unimpressed with this one!,"I love how this opens, and I sensed musk and vodka straight away at the top without knowing the listed notes. Unfortunately, this is turning sweet on me, too sweet. And the white florals aren't right for me. Too bad too - love the opening otherwise. Have to scrub - the white florals are just too irritating for me. (PS - I often have this reaction to white florals, particularly with CK & Givenchy. Armani joins that list.)"
3,is this fake??,I bought this product from lisa perfumes. does anyone know if they sell fakes? they had good feedback so I assumed they would be an honest company but I'm skeptical this acqua di gio is the real deal. I've never used acqua di gio before so i ca't be entirely sure but i'm gonna see if it lasts me the wholes day and if it doesn't im totally returning it.
5,My Fav,This order showed up on time and was exactly what I ordered. Wife loves it and what makes her happy makes me happy as well! ;)
1,Don't buy,"I was not pleased , after all that hype , I feel this is fake yes all that money .....don't buy ,right now it in a corner .....do not buy"
3,Acqua Di Gio,"The cologne is great, but the bottle was damaged (assumed from shipping)...lost about 1/3 of it and it was a Christmas present.Otherwise though, this stuff is great-"
1,Bottle cracked and did not smell anything like aqua di gio,"My husband has been wearing this brand of cologne for years and was out, so thought I found a good deal - about $20 cheaper than the stores....well it was not worth it. Maybe it was really old or maybe it was dumped out and a different brand was put in there, but I have learned my lesson not to buy a product like this on-line again."
3,Seemed less strong,"Hmmm, this sucked and seemed less strong than the one from the store. Not sellers fault. The manufacturer made it less strong I guess"
1,Complete rip for the price,For $40 I'm going to get about 40 sprays from this. A complete rip for the price. Do some shopping on another site and you can get twice the size for the same price.
1,FAKE fragrance from DOLE PERFUME,I ordered a bottle of Aqua Di Gio from the seller DOLE PERFUME as a christmas gift. It was painfully and embarrassingly obvious that this is a fake version of the cologne. The smell is nowhere near the same. The ad did not advertise this as being an imitation anywhere and I am more than disappointed. BEWARE!!!
4,"Awesome cologne, everyone has it.","This is just an awesome smelling cologne. The biggest problem is it is also the most popular. Every guy has it. So if you want to smell like every other guy go ahead and get it. If you want a unique scent that you want women to only think of you when they smell it, get something else. I remember when I wore it I couldn't help but think of other guys I had smelt it on. No something I like to be doing. Its popularity is the only reason preventing it from getting a full five stars."
1,Beware!,"I love Aqua Di Gio, but that's not what I received from Globalworx. I can't even describe what came out of the bottle! FAKE! Not even close! No cellophane wrapping on box and bottle seems to have been tampered with. I have never had this problem with an Amazon merchant before. I am very disappointed in merchant and Amazon. Maybe Amazon doesn't need my business anymore. I sure they probably don't care. How unfortunate."
5,cologne was great!,"The cologne came packaged well, was in excellent shape and my husband loves it! I would buy from this seller again."
1,Doesn't appear to be the real deal,"I love amazon and purchase items almost weekly. I love this scent as well and am acquainted with what it should smell like and how it remains, etc. Upon receiving this, I was not convinced this is the real item. It smells similar, but not like the Acqua Di Gio I am accustomed to. The real McCoy lingers for some time, this however was hard to discern after even an hour or two. Fortunately, Amazon issued a refund. I suppose buying fragrances online just has risks like these. Perhaps some receive the real deal and some do not. Not sure how one would know! I plan on purchasing locally and smelling the actual bottle I buy first."
1,Fake Perfume,I received a fake perfume. There is absolutely no smell in this thing... It was a birthday gift for my hubby and we were totally dissapointed with the purchase.
1,HORRIBLE REFUSE THIS SELLER,I WROTE THIS GUY TWICE... CUASE IT'S KNOCKOFF ACQUA DI GIO... REFUSED TO RESPOND BACK OR GIVE ME INFO ON RETURNS OR REFUND.... DO NOT USE THIS SELLER
3,Good as a soccer game can be,"This game has nice graphics, good gameplay, and it probably the best soccer game ever made. I do not see a franchise mode in the game and the buttons for menus are not consistent with other EA games which is just ridiculous.The game will provide you with hours of soccer fun. If you don't like soccer you will probably get bored of it after a while, but this is one of the better games. I would rent it before buying it if I could go back in time."
4,Best graphics ever,"I must admit I bought my PS2 primarily to play this game. The atmosphere of a real soccer game is well captured through the lifelike graphics, animation, sound effects and the TV commentary. The main drawback is what have already been mentioned by the other posters, it is almost impossible to score by conventional ""real-world soccer"" means and much too easy to score doing bicycle kicks. (i.e. once you figure it out it is not uncommon to get 8-0 wins all of the goals being bicycle kicks). The other thing is that in none of the European competitions are you given the option to play with my favorite team Galatasaray of Turkey even though they do compete as AI-only opposition in these tournaments."
4,Inspiring!,"I loved this book. While I've only used the smoothie/juice recipes, this book has provided me with great results. The recipes are excellent, but you also get a sense of what things you can use to create your own.In fact, it's the only book I leave out on my kitchen counter, since I know I'm going to use it at least 3 times a week!"
2,Most of the information is available for FREE at SAP site,"I purchased this book when i was implementing my first SRM project. This book covers all the steps needed for the configuration but does not include all the details. Most of the topics covered in this book are also available in the SAP Configuration guide that is available in SAP Site. There are couple of chapters that are quite useful but that information is also available at the SDN forums.Business scenario configuration guides can be downloaded at the following link https://websmp105.sap-ag.de/ibc-srm .The SAP Business scenario configuration guides can be used for starting your implementation. For any problems during implementation , you can search for solutions at the SDN forum for FREE at https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/collaboration . There are lot of useful tips in this forum be it CLASSIC or EXTENDED CLASSIC scenarios."
3,Boring after 1st time,"for this price its worth a try. but after watching it 1 time its plain a extra thing in my house i dont need,"
5,The Love of Wines,"This is the third book (plus one revised) on wine authored by Dottie & John, two very talented writers for the Wall Street Journal. If you enjoyed their first two books, you will love this one. As you probably already know, their books are not intended to be atlases of viticulture, but are ""how to books"" on the enjoyment of wine and how wine impacts our day to day life. How wine makes daily events more meaningful and helps to rekindle memories of remote events. The book should be read as a novel -- cover to cover -- as there are pearls of information in every chapter, including hints on how to tour domestic and foreign wine regions, on shopping for wine, gift suggestions, wine websites, and of course multiple suggestions for wines for any occasion. Most importantly, this book describes how hundreds of others across the world and you the reader can integrate the love of wine into your daily life."
4,Baggy but such a good value for gusseted jeans,"My husband prefers jeans with the a gusset and as you probably know, they're hard to find. Until now he's worn ones by Duluth; unfortunately they've gotten WAY too expensive and they're just not worth the price. We ordered several pair of Riggs and found them to all be quite baggy on his slim frame (not just the ""relaxed fit"" ones--all of them). The other brand looked better but not enough to justify their price. We're happy to deal with some bagginess in exchange for the great value of these jeans."
5,One of the Top Vocal Jazz groups of all time.,"I first became aware of this group through their Christmas album, which is a cut above the usual. This retrospective collection has become one of the most played sets in my collection."
1,Poorly Written!!,"I agree with one of the previous comments. This is a TERRIBLY written book. Grammar problems, horrible, redundant transitions and many, many spelling errors. I think she must have published this on her own.The stories themselves... well, some are okay, for a general idea of ""the business"" but not really. I don't reccomend this book. It's not worth it. Especially since it's only 89 pages.Try: Strip City, by Lily Burana instead!"
1,"Book lacks infprmation, it's more like a funny story","Most of the other reviews say this book is funny, well it is but that is it. It sounds like the author went out of her way to make the world of stripping sound funny and nothing else.She barely touches the surface. She writes aobut what the guys do and what the strippers do in those establishments, but it attempts to make light of it, or make sound like a glamorous funny thing. As a bouncer, I can tell you tha tthis book is way off. I read it with my girlfriend and can't get over the misconception this author puts out.I might be ok for someone reading it that knows nothing about strippers or hasn't a clue, but for the average person, it is worthless reading."
3,Short book with lots of filler.,This book is very short...Only about 80 pages with bigger print than usual. The stories that she depicts are true. Some of the book I would consider just filler to try and fill up space For example: Providing a list of all the stripper names she could remember (I don't care) Nobody really wants to read a page and a half of names. Or the questions she was asked with the question like How much do you make? Double space. Her response. Double space. Next question. An OK book if you get it really cheap and you just have a little time to kill.
1,UGH One of the worst books I've Ever read,"awww come on, if any book deserves a half a star (or how about zero) it's this one! Glad I didn't spend money to buy it cause if I had I'd be so pissed off at myself I wouldn't be able to handle it. Okay on to the review..well this woman is so into herself it'll about make you gag. I laughed my way through most of it cause it was just so stupid that I had to laugh at myself because I was reading the damn thing! It's all about her but then yet again according to her none of it is about her or is about anything she would ever do or had done. She has to be the biggest hypocrite ever born and if there's one thing I can't stand it's a hypocrite. PLEASE just take my word for it, you don't want to read this book. It's total crap!! UGH"
1,Written in a Weekend?,"Lousy little book--I picked it up at a bookstore on the road without looking closely. Not only is there scant factual basis for the book, it inserts quotes and 'thoughts' of the subjects that the author can't know. There are so many good accounts of the lives of the Windsors that this was a true waste of time, and an insult to royals and readers alike. Avoid."
4,Not much new here,"I had read that this was a different kind of biography and it proved to be. There wasn't much I hadn't read before, but I did enjoy the never-before-seen photographs.If the book is a bit dull, it is because the subject is. The Queen isn't terribly interesting or exciting. I think she is a nice person. A good Christian and very good at her duties which she takes very seriously. Maybe that is enough. I think she relates better to animals than to her family, but that doesn't make her a bad person."
5,very powerful,"this movie was really a goodmovie. i recommend anyone towatch this movie. young andold. it addressed a lot of thingslike racism, greed, love,family andmore."
1,Don't Encourage Them!!,"This CD contains shamefully bad cover version of various Disco songs. They are NOT entertaining covers, unless you enjoy unintentionally hilarious music, in which case these are comedy gold!These covers are cheaply produced, and lack the charm of the originals. It's albums like this which give Disco a bad name.There are plenty of fine, high quality compilations of Disco music, This is NOT one of them!!"
2,Disappointing,I don't know how this can be called a Film Encyclopedia when one cannot look up a film by its title.
5,The standard by which to judge all others,"It's the Film Encyclopedia, not Films. It's about people and processes and explanation of film terms. In those aspects it has no peer. The latest revision is now 4 years old and you may expect a new one fairly soon. But this was not designed tell you about people who are one-hit-wonders. It was designed to tell you about those whose work is worth remembering. We can only hope that Katz' successors will not weaken and include the flavor-of-the-year."
4,Raised on the classix!,"It's obvious these mugs were weened on the earliest LPs of the Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts and Business. Classic (and NON-Racist!) British street Oi! The titles say it all: ""law n order, up your..."", two chords- two fingers"", propper c..."", and ""still fighting Thatcher"". Only 30 minutes but more four letter words that the Anti-Nowhere League!"
5,Pleasures...abound wow,"I love Will downing, and Gerald Albright...I had this cd years ago..and lost it so being able to locate and purchase was a dream come true...Cd in great condition, shipping awesome...and most of all in speedy time...Love this seller, would buy again from them definitely!"
4,Lunch box review,"Arrived quickly, in good condition, and functions well. Reason for four star rating and not five...I ordered black/gray and received black/orange, regardless the lunch box is a quality item."
1,Pointless waste of innocent trees,"According to the cover blurb this book reflects the very latest brain research. In fact it is almost completely based on what is known as ""Hebbian Learning"", or as this author puts it (over and over and OVER again) ""cells that fire together, wire together.""Is this new? Not unless you count research circa 1949 as new.Despite the author's impressive CV, this book has a single message - brain cells don't regenerate, but the more you use your brain the more new connections it will develop.Question is, how to you string this message out to over 250 pages? With lots of waffle and SERIOUS repetition. That's how.Not even a total newcomer to the subject will be able to extract much from this simplistic, even patronising text.Conclusion: Like the headline says, a pointless waste of innocent trees."

5,Very fun 3D movie for teens and grown-ups!,"With all the magical, child-like 3d movies to choose from, we finally have one that is for ""big kids"" haha. Its fun, 3D is cool, but movie would be jut as good without it."
2,Really bad remake,"The high rating reviews listed for this movie prompted me to rent it. Wow what a mistake, This is a so-so movie with so-so-so acting. I`m a huge fan of the original film and was very excited by the many positive reviews I read on this site. I was not expecting such a thin plot and shoddy acting. This left me to consider the possibility that the majority of the misleading reviews on this site are fake, perhaps an Amazon marketing ploy, because this movie is not at all properly portrayed. Okay,yeah true, Colin is hot, I'll give them that, but so what?"
4,"""Fright Night"" review","Being a fan of Colin Farrell, I had NO problem following him in this most enjoyablemovie. Very well made, I thought."
2,Lame,"This is a terrible remake. It lacks all of the charm of the original, leaving the viewer with a revamped (no pun intended) story line that is ridiculous. The dialogue is horrendous. There is nothing about this movie that recommends itself."
1,Tedious,I wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed at how bad this was. There was nothing scary or funny about this movie.
2,glad I only spent 2 dollars on it,"After seeing that people rated this movie a 4 or 5 star I decided I would give it ago, I like vampire and supernatural movies. However the plot to this movie was severely disappointing. And it was pretty poorly made.. I suggest finding another movie to rent!"
5,Good Movie!!!,I bought this movie as a gift at Christmas time. I was really happy with the price of the item and how fast it was shipped to me.
1,"Okay, Colin this is not your fault!","Colin is a solid actor so I do not blame him for his bad acting in this film. I understand he was supposed to be a cute, sexy and hip vampire but he came across as super cheesy. And being a fan of the one with Chris Sarandon, I did not like this one. It did not do justice to the original."
1,what's the point???,Dsiappointing. Loved the original. The only part that got my attention was Chris Saradon's cameo. They had such a wealth of material. Hollywood needs to stop making remakes!!!!
1,"Horrible, cheap black & white printing of a great book","Despite what the item description says, there are no color pages in this cheap reprinting. The pages are printed only in black and white, and are printed in very poor quality. What a shame, because the book itself is fantastic. I have an original printing of this book and love it. I ordered this reprint as a gift and had to return it because of the poor print quality. I wish I had noticed the other reviews about this problem (listed below) before I wasted my time and money!"
3,Neither fish nor fowl,"The author laments that it will be impossible to adequately treat the subject in a non-mathematical way. The results prove his point, since the abstract nature of the distinctions between various particles and force carriers makes them incomprehensible. It would have been better to include enough math to at least form a guide for the interested reader to pursue furhter the intellectual trail that lead to the standard model of particle physics. Another approach might have been to make a braver effort to really describe the physical nature of the particles and interactions covered.I was disappointed by this book, but a reader more advanced in the subject would probably find this book a very readable history of the development of particle physics."
4,Get it if you don't have the movie Silver Spear aka Silver Hermit,"-This Old Skool Killaz set brings four classics.Young Hero of Shaolin 1 and 2,Jade Dagger Ninja,Silver Spear aka Silver Hermit.-Bonzai has got the Young Hero of Shaolin versions widescreen with English and Cantonese language tracks.Originally for the UK label Soulblade.-Jade Dagger Ninja unless you are a real fan of the movie has gotten a widescreen,somewhat remastered version from Flkcinema.-The only movie that has not yet been remastered and is rare to find is Silver Spear aka Silver Hermit.Also starring Tien Peng and Chen Sing.if you like Jade Dagger Ninja you will most likely enjoy Silver Spear."
3,Sad,"Oh, this is a book with such potential that is ruined by presentation. The author has a unique view for a Western academic in that he taught in China, and there developed a vision of Egyptian seen in terms of Eastern brush caligraphy rather than Western or Middle Eastern pen calligraphy. But the presentation using a mid-Eighties computer fount designed by the author is so bad as to make the book virtually unusable for me. I really do hope he will reapproach the book with professional typographic help - if he is still in China, there must be many able to aid him.If the reader simply wants to learn 'Egyptian' regardless of period or style, I must recommend J. P. Allen's Middle Egyptian. It is, of course, the language of a different period and uses heiroglyphics, not heiratic."
2,The 6 Most Important Decisions You'll Ever Make: A Guide for Teens,Not of any interest to my 16 year old granddaughter - perhaps for a younger audience. The book is being returned.
1,"I Like The Movie But Buyer Beware, The DVD Is Absolutely Terrible","I bought this DVD when it first became available years ago and I find it appalling that the sellers on Amazon are charging up to over $150.00 for this piece of trash DVD copy. I don't care how state of the art your video system is, NOTHING can help the quality (or lack thereof) of this DVD. The color, sharpness, contrast, brightness, the lack of widescreen format, everything about it just insults the whole concept of DVD's and I even rate this as a very poor copy even for a pirated VHS movie. Hopefully this film will be re-released in the correct way now that Bluray has entered the market.So as I said, buyer beware; YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!"
2,Please re-issue !!!!!,"This movie is very good as far as sequels go and this transfer to DVD is simply unacceptable! Anamorphic widescreen and remastering would improve this a hundred fold. And some nice extras would'nt hurt either. In 2009 it will be the 20 year anniversary, so for you studio heads out there who re-release other movies every five years, how about giving us Fright Night 2 for essentially the first time."
5,A true modern vampire classic,"In my opinion, I prefer this sequel to the first one but I do like both movies. This film is pretty sensual and captivating with great music and interesting cast. Its not really scary nevertheless there are some shocking moments which are quite enjoyable. One of the best vampire films around. It would definitely be great in DVD."
4,Waiting and waiting for DVD,"I'm a huge fan of this film, and agree with a few of the other reviewers in that I actually prefer it to the first. I'd have to say it's sexier, that the plot is a bit more complex, and there are far more secondary and tertiary characters adding to the depth. But I don't own this video. I WANT to own it, but I keep thinking that they're going to release it on DVD, and that would be far superior. So, here I am. Waiting. I wonder if anyone influential reads these things?"
4,ok but a tight fit,"I bought this for the Jack Richeson Academy Weston Full French Easel. While it does fit, it's a very tight squeeze to zip it all in properly at the top - the legs of the easel just seem a tad long for this particular bag. Some of the sewing/zipper/seam construction internally appears cheap. That said, it will be serviceable, the pockets will be handy. I primary bought it to take it through security at the airport or it I take the train to a nearby park to draw, I think it will come in handy."
3,Not so true,"I started reading this book in December and have not been able to maintain interest in this book. For one reason, there are too many people/characters with no relevant meanings. Secondly, the author rambles about certain details in the book that creates confusion about situations, things, or persons. Perhaps the information could have been condensed to add more zest to the book. Finally, I am down to the last 5 pages of the book and I feel like I have missed something. I am an avid reader and enjoy all sorts of books from fiction to non-fiction, bio's, and inspirationals. Unfortunately, I was disappointed and wish that I could return both books (parts 1 and 2)."
2,An Ok book 2/1/2,"Based on the reviews of this book I know alot of people won't agree with me but oh well. People have been telling me for months and months to get this book. Well I finally got it and it really didn't live up to the hype. It wasn't a horrible book but it wasn't that good either. When I read this book I kept thinking this story was trying to be a subpar ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" but it never quite made it. Gena and Qua were ok characters but there were too many other characters in the book that made the storyline too junky. Another thing that bothered me about this book is the countless grammatical errors and misspelled words. I'm sorry people but that is not acceptable in anyone's book, self-published or not. Please read The Coldest Winter Ever to see a true example of how a story like this should be done."
2,It wasn't ALLLLLL That,Everyone hyped this book up to be so decent but to me it was a typical drug dealing book It was kind of confusing at parts and just dumb everything I thought would happen in the book happend its not different from any other books I want my money back All the characters seemed so fake it was just not a good book
4,"Keep the message, lose the editor.","True to the game was an excellent fable; however, the writing was terrible, which is the reason why I reduced the review from five stars to four. I really enjoyed the plot, which often caused me to smile, laugh, become livid and cry, throughout certain scenes. I believe that it sends an important message to my peers and to a much larger audience. In my opinion, the synopsis of the book is the fallen of a young couple in love and thier friends, who struggled throughout their childhoods, due to the temptations and glamour of fast money and lavish luxuries. Overall, I believe that the lesson to be learned from reading this book is that anything that comes too easy in life is not worth having, due to the consequences, which can sometimes mean a life."
4,A Good Read,All in All the book was good. The ending I thought could have been better. It was real though. I think the author was trying to bring street book back and she did.
1,where or where,I haven't got my book yet order on June 14 and it is now July 17 where oh where is my book at
5,TRUE TO GAME HIT CLOSE TO HOME!!,"I FIRST READ THE THIS NOVEL IN THE MID 90's . I DIDN'T FINISH IT, BUT FROM WHAT I READ ABOUT GENA AND QUADIR I ENJOYED.I THIKN PICKED IT BACK UP IN 2006 AND COULDN'T BELIEVE I WAITED THAT LONG TO FINISH IT!..lol..GENA A ND QUADIR'S STORY WAS MY ERA, ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE STREET SCENE, I KNEW PLENTY WHO DID SO TO SPEAK..THIS STORY WAS REAL TO ME AND THATS WHY I COULD RELATE.TERI WOODS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AT CAPTURING THE REALITIES OF THE LIVES THAT SO MANY LIVED DURING THAT TIME!"
3,Pretty good read: Satisfied,"I read this book in a matter of 3 days, which could've been quicker had I not had anything else to do. It was luring. Not too predictable. I'd recommend it."
2,Not What I Expected,"When I read all the reviews on this book I thought wow I have got to read this book. Well lets just say that I was a little upset because it was not what I thought that it was going to be. Lets just say that I have read better. If you really want to read this book, borrow it."
4,GHETTO LOVE AT ITS BEST,This book was great! I couldn't put it down. This gave a realistic view of the hustle life
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"I COULD NOT STOP READING THIS BOOK AND HAVE ALREADY LENT IT TO MY GIRLFRIEND. I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF ""JUST ONE MORE CHAPTER"" BECAUSE I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE."
5,Great Book,This book was off the hook. I would stay up very late just to finish the chapter.Then of course I had to read about 3 more.I have been around the game and True To The Game is right onthe money. You won't be disappointed. It's worth you money andtime.
4,true to the game,"True to the game was a very,very good book! I couldn't put it down until i read the whole book! I look forward to reading part2 and three!"
5,So True,I must say this is the first street story that got me. This story was so real and touching how could you not love it. I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Ms.Woods and I give her mad respect for her story and her courage.
3,Very good urban novel,"This is a good read, especially if you are into the ""urban stories"". This one was actually interesting. Writing lacks something- first novel so expected- but good."
5,Great Read,"I read ""B-more Careful"" first and was really impressed. The book spoke to me and everything seemed of what I knew. A co-worker said that ""True to the Game"" was by the same author, but under a different name, I ran to get the book. It was Great! I finished it in one day. I could not put it down. It is well worth the purchase."
1,Ms. Woods should take a few writing classes.,"I found this book to be lacking in so many areas. I think Ms. Woods should fire her editor if she has one, there are so many typos and misspellings that it is ridiculous. It reads like a children's book, it is so elementary. Her style of writing is so elementary. I am surprised that it got such a good rating, but the people rating it must not read alot. Or they do not know what a good writer is suppose to put out there, my advice to Ms. Woods is please take a writing class, and read a few books by E. Lynn Harris or Jerome Dickey or Stephen King for that matter. I know every writer has their own style but, this style or author is just not worth reading."
1,The Coldest Winter Ever It Isn't!,"I have read a lot of reviewers comparing this to The Coldest Winter Ever but there IS NO COMPARISON between the two books. True To The Game is a bunch of stereotypical characters in a shallow-at-best plot. Even Gena's grandmother, the ONE character I was hoping would have some sense, was about as pathetic as they come. If you want to read a real book with a decent plot, read The Coldest Winter Ever, not True To The Game!"
4,Really good book!,"I enjoyed this book alot. Since I was born in 1985, and reading from the years of 1988-90, it had me thinking I was 19 at that time period. Teri Woods did a great job mixing love and hustling together; and still managed to keep it street. She really opens your eyes on how street life was in West and North Philly. It was a mix of Scarface and New Jack City all into one. But just with the 'Thug Love' to add to it. But check this book out you may enjoy it."
2,Another owner of the older model,"Like ""Consuma"", I was replacing an older model of this drain rack and can confirm the newer model is not as sturdy.The wire frame is much thinner. Because of this, the attachments for glasses have a tendency to bend outward when heavier glasses and mugs are placed on them. The feet of the old model were made of hard rubber, and helped to keep the rack in place. The feet of the newer model are plastic, and the rack often slips towards the sink as it's loaded with dishes.It's not a terrible dish rack, and I guess the antimicrobial coating is nice, (although I never had a problem with mold on the old rack) it's just a cheaper, flimsier version of the old one.I wrote a review of theRubbermaid Antimicrobial Large Drain Board, Blackthat goes with this, it didn't fare as well."
2,one of rubber feet missing from drainer,The drained came with one of the rubber feet missing. I'm not sending it back but I am very disappointed. It couldn't have fallen off because the 3 other rubber feet seem to be bonded to the stainer.
5,"Rubbermaid 6032AEWHT Antimicrobial Large Dish Drainer, White","Purchased this for family living in a community that didn't have this product available locally. Rubbermaid bespeaks good quality and antimicrobial treatment is a plus. Dimensions of drainer were what sold it. Locally everything available was smaller dimensions. Happy purchase, good service."
3,Dish drainer,"Delivery was prompt. Don't like the white, would prefer beige tone. Also, I do not like the silverware holder in the middle of this product. Utensils keep catching your arm. Should of left holder on the side, as original product first had."
2,I like the size but there are no compartments for silverware,I like this but there are no compartments for silverware. I never would have expected that. I guess the picture doesn't have the compartments but I honestly didn't think about it until I received it. Very annoying. Couldn't find any to purchase separately on Amazon either.
3,SMALL DISH DRAINER,"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS SMALL DISH DRAINER IT WAS ""SUPPOSED"" TO COME WITH A SILVERWARE CUP, BUT NONE WAS WITH IT! SO I LET AMAZON KNOW THIS AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL ENOUGH TO SEND ME ANOTHER ORDER (no charge) WELL WHEN I RECEIVED IT THERE WAS NO SILVERWARE CUP IN THIS ORDER EITHER!! SO THEY REFUNDED MY $$ AND WHEN I SENT ORDER BACK THEY ALSO REFUNDED MY POSTAGE FOR SAME!! I FEEL THAT THEY DID THEIR BEST TO HELP ME AND I WILL ORDER MORE FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE!"
4,Good Solid Drying Rack,"This drying rack is pretty big, which I personally appreciate. It is sturdy and getting the job done so far."
2,Arrived broken.,The rack is fine. The attachment that should clip on to hold spoons etc has a broken hook making it useless.
4,"Product good, packing not so good","Unfortunately, we wanted this in white and could only get it from a third party seller in that color. We bought two of them in the same order. When they arrived, the drainers were stacked carelessly and we had to untangle the side hooks in order to separate the drainers from each other. The bottom drainer had black marks on the bottom of the feet that we had to clean off before we used it. However, once we got past those packing/unpacking issues and set up the drainers, they work fine and we are pleased with them.I am glad I saved the corner utensil cups from our former drainers because this only comes with one that goes on the end (as shown), so we needed the old ones to get enough space to drain all of the utensils in a typical load of dishwashing. I don't like using the automatic dishwasher at all, so all of our dishwashing is done by hand."
3,A Definite Step Down From The Old Style,"I ordered this for my wife who had an old one for years. She really wanted just a simple, sturdy, yet not ugly dish drainer. Compared to the old ones, this one is less sturdy, flimsier, and the silverware holders are inferior. I can't compare it to other brands, as this is all we have had. It is acceptable, but less quality."
5,Really like this dish drainer,I put inside one of my double sinks for dishes to dry. I have used one for years and really like the black one in my stainless steel sink.
3,Better than I expected,"This was among the 7 pieces of source material on my most recent exam. It was better than I expected. I looked at it from the perspective that I should use a person's culture to my advantage. With a familiarity of culture specific issues, I can make myself a more effective police officer. I found the author's writing to be of high quality, but book did not make me more culturally diverse. If you are looking for a book that teaches you how to be a police officer, this is not it. If you are looking for a book that might explain why the Iranian guy got mad at you last week, this is the right one."
4,2nd Greatest Story ever told,"This book is thought provoking and humorous. It gives an account of how the media and church leaders may respond to the 'what if Jesus did have a brother or sister and she came to live amongst us today!' I can only imagine what the headlines would read. Part of this story will test moral imaginations and some things are hard to imagine for a child of God, but it's ficion.It is like this nation under God has His Daughter come down and check if out, deliver God's message, straighten a few things out and report back, ha.This book is also a reminder that we never know 'if or when'we are entertaining an angel and that we should always 'be kind' to everyone we meet. If we can.I laughed, I cried, I laughed again and then I prayed.I am glad I read this book. This is a good like this book.Be kind. END"
1,Read four times?,This book was recommended to me by a friend and it's the last time I'm going to take literary advice from her! ... END
5,Sasha's Delight!,"If you have a child named Sasha then I strongly suggest that you give her this book. It was one of my all-time favorites as a child and I think my mother donated the book to my elementry school library (that how much it meant to me). There are many books with Marys, Elizabeths, Janes...but a Sasha book is hard to come by. Rave review!!"
3,Children of The Stars- the new album from Aaron Ferguson,"Now, I've known Aaron most of my life, and his music has had a great influence on my own, and I think this album came out very good. All the parts fit together nicely. I love the way he weaves the piano in with the guitar parts. His vocals are always clear, and it all sounds together. I've heard some of his previous ""basment tapes"" and, I'm afraid to say, I thought they were kind of empty, or missing something. I must say I was a bit skeptical, but it all worked out. The other musicians filled out the sound nicely. You're probably thinking ""why did he only give it a three if he liked it so much?"" The answer to that is: I don't think any of the songs will be big hits. They're up beat and all, but some of them are just a little too long; one runs about 7 minutes, and another is over 10! Do I recomend this album? Absoulutly. It is truely a nice cd to listen to when you want to relax, and even when you're driving down the road."
5,This is a hard to find item for older kitchen drawers,I was extremely happy to find this bracket as my Hubby had broken one of the old drawer bracket. Thought I would never find this itema dn be stuck with a drawer that fall out when pulled on. Buy 2 as these will probably be discontined as the drawers are now bracketed with plastic devices.
2,Boring and whiney: what's the big deal?,"I had heard so many raves about this album, in Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and everywhere else. I thought it might be an interesting merging of Costello's balladeer phase and Bachrach's progression into something at least marginally different than he had done in the past. BUT: I really find this to be so boringly derivative that I can hardly make it through the whole album. What are people entranced by here? I really would like to know what I'm missing!"
4,Almost a classic,"What is it about Elvis Costello's voice? When I was in college, I was able to listen to listen to the guy sing for hours on end. Now that I'm 15 years older, I find myself wishing Burt had insisted on someone a bit less painful sounding to render these compositions. That said, the songs are brilliant, stunning -- high water marks for both Burt and Elvis, as far as I'm concerned. It's frankly exciting to hear a whole album of songs which could easily enter the standards canon. ""This House Is Empty Now"" gives me chills. Maybe Elvis' voice will grow in appeal the more I listen to this; right now I find it, disappointingly, the one weak link in an otherwise astonishing album."
5,Costello is the Cole Porter of Our Generation,"David Marsh may have called Elvis Costello the most overrated song writer of his generation, but his collaboration with Burt Bacharach suggests he is indeed the Cole Porter of our generation. Few popular artists emerged from the punk scene and grew musically to the extent that EC did as the voice of the Brodsky Quartet. In the age of Retro, Costello proves to be an original."
1,"I'm a little late, but I have to bash this album...","...because it sticks out in my memory as one of the most distinctly bad records I've ever purchased. I can only categorize my reaction to this album as ""allergic."" After one listen I was ashamed of myself for buying this record and I could not get to the ""Buy, Sell or Trade"" shop to sell it back fast enough because it bothered me to even have it in my possession. Bad poetry over slow, boring music."
4,Elvis and Burt = The Sweetest Punch,A risky pairing that paid off!Bacharach is in top form! His melodic sense is as wonderful as it ever was. Elvis has an AMAZING voice that will break your heart. His instrument continues to get better and better. I only wish there were more artistic pairings of this diversity and caliber.
4,Very good,"This is such a good album. I've been looking through all the reviews, and see that it has received some 1 and 2 star ratings. I actually didn't dig it the first two or three plays through. I think it's an acquired taste, really. Long story short; try to listen to it more than once, you might be surprised."
2,Hasn't Held My Attention,"THERE ARE A FEW GOOD TRACKS ON THIS, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST 2, ESPECIALLY ""TOLEDO,"" BUT OF ALL E.C.'S RECENT STUFF, THIS IS THE LEAST COMPELLING. WHICH SURPRISED ME -- I HAD HIGH HOPES AND AM ALMOST ALWAYS UNCRITICAL OF ANYTHING HE PUTS OUT."
3,"Nice looking, not functional","If you're looking for a wood high chair, this may suit your fancy, but just get an all wood one. I thought this was great having the look of a wood chair, but the functions of a new/plastic one. But not so.First, your child has to be able to sit up on their own completely to use it. Some of the other plastic ones tilt, so you can use it sooner. I had to feed my son cereal in his bouncer because of this.It's hard to clean. The tray that lifts out, stuff gets under it all the time, so you need to remove both to clean. My son, at under a year old, can also pull the top part out on his own already. The sides have so many notches and groves that get food in them too.It's also heavy, so you can't move it around very well. The belt is difficult to use, not quick and easy to snap.I do like the look (although, when you register you can't specify the color of the cover, which I wanted blue and got red)."
3,Attractive but not practical,"I purchased this highchair, because it was attractive, and I wanted to stay away from the bright colored, plastic ones. However, now that I have it, I wish I had a bright colored, plastic one. This highchair is heavy, difficult to move around the kitchen, and it doesn't fold, recline, or roll. These features are important to have, and I am disappointed this highchair has none of them. I regret the purchase of this highchair and am conisdering purchasing a Chicco or something more versatile and mom friendly."
2,hazard,"I love this chair for its style. However my daughter's leg was trapped between the front side slat and it became red-purple swollen. She was in extreme pain trying to free her and 10 minutes of ice and dishsoap did I manage to free her. The velcro to secure pad scraches her legs everytime and the buckle is very annoying to use. It is located on the bottom of the seat when my baby sits, annoying. This chair can be a hazard and Eddie Bauer shouldv'e made it better in many ways!"
3,Haynes Repair Manual for Honda Accord,"Like many auto repair manuals, this one assumes the reader has a lot of experience and knowledge. I needed to replace the right drive shaft. I spent hours trying to get the hub nut off and the ball joint separated. Much of my time was used looking up suggestions on the internet until I found something that worked. The manual simply says take them off with no real indication how. It's a decent how-to manual, but you'll need the help of the internet or a friend who knows what he's doing."
3,Nice and uncomfortable,"This headset has great battery life, dedicated volume and power buttons and another button that answers and hangs up calls and activates voice dial. It has great sound quality and the microphone is clear. Also, it looks cool. It doesn't have any nerdy, annoying flashing lights. It's just slick. Judged by its features, it deserves 5 stars. I give it 3 because I can barely wear it for an hour. I wear an earpiece headset at work, sometimes all day long, without any problem. This one squeezes down so hard that it actually gets painful! I thought I would get used to it, but I've had it for 3 months now and no luck. I now wear it hanging halfway off my ear so that it can't clamp down so hard. I applaud Nokia for trying something different, but it's no good."
2,Too uncomfortable to wear,"Excellent features, great battery life but I can't stand to wear it so what's the point? Never would have bought it if I had tried it on first. I can't seem to get the phrase ""binder clip on my ear"" out of my head when I think of this headset."
2,"Good at home, TERRIBLE in the car","I thought my only complaint about this BT headset would be the way it hooks to your ear. Actually, I found it to a pretty nice fit. It works fine at home and the voice command system on my phone picks up all of my commands. Once you get in the car and start driving it all goes down the toilet. I guess it picks up too much background noise or something, but it absolutely will not recognize my voice commands. This makes it pretty much worthless to me, as the handsfree aspect of a BT headset is more important while driving than anywhere else.Oh, one more thing. I found the ear volume to be much too low for my tastes."
3,baby hated this thing,"In comparison to the others that are alot cheaper, I would not recommend buying this style. Even though you can unzip from under the babies chin down, and it is quite warm, my little one did not like the fact that the fluffiness around his head kept him from seeing side to side. I tried my best to fold the whole head area back but he could not see out of the thing."
3,So-so,"I was not really thrilled with this product. It was very warm and stayed on the infant carrier well, but the flap over the face barely closed and I really had to hold it closed with my free hand in the harsh Minnesota wind. My old one, for my daughter several years ago, closed all the way with a small piece of velcro to protect against the wind.Other than the face opening, it is a great prodcut. Washes excellent, no fading or stretching or anything. Love the little pacifer pocket, that came in handy."
2,NOT made in the USA as stated,"Product information says ""made in the USA"" which certainly drove my choice of this particular luggage carrier. Handle clearly states ""made in the Philippines"". No review of item as I haven't used it."
1,Travel Cart,The wheel fell off and the item did not work properly. I ended up leaving it in the airport in Atlanta.
3,I WANT SOME CHERRY PIE,"Marvin and Johnny were an L.A. based singing duo in the 1950's. They sang a lot of R&B songs in harmony. Probably their most well-known song is ""Cherry Pie"". This CD features a lot of the songs they recorded in that period. SOME OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT, OTHERS NOT SO GOOD."
1,EXPLOITATION OF OUR KIDS!!!!,"this author is so distasteful. they should slap a big ""warning"" on this series and remove it from the ""kids section"" of the library. who would think an author would write about SEX??? these are young readers. leave it up to the parents to teach their own kids. trusting this author is a mistake!!!!!"
4,Not your usual pre-teen book,"My 12 year old loved this book! When I read it after her, I can see why. The author does a wonderful job of not ""talking down"" to the reader. She briefly touches on topics such as birth control, hazing and family abuse but in a way that is understandable and real to the young reader. Great way to begin conversation with your child!"
5,Excelent reading for people interested in the area,"Excelente reading. Clear and concise. The author not only shows his most interesting cases but also makes a parallel with Brain Evolution. You don't have to be a medicine student to read the book, but you must have at least a minimum knowledge of the basic parts of the brain to understand. The cases just show how the brain can fail in its activities and the results on the patients perceptions of things due to this failure."
3,Not The Giver,"This is definitely not on a par with The Giver, but it is good in its own way. While I cannot recommend it, I'm happy I read it. Lacking the emotional punch, originality, and perfect pacing of The Giver. Also had a hard time getting into the lengthy descriptions of threads."
3,Wasn't satisfied,"I remember reading ""The Giver"" a few years back and being absolutely drawn into it. I couldn't believe the imagination Lois Lowry had and it became my all-time favorite book, just in one day. So recently I discovered ""Gathering Blue"" and was willing to give it a try. I was very disappointed. The setting of the story was all too familiar, and the ending was very predictable. Even the ""singled out child"" type of plot was the same. I was looking for something different and fresh, not just a mere copy of ""The Giver."" I applaud Lois Lowry for her attempt to make ""Gathering Blue"" as worthy as ""The Giver"" but in my opinion, it was hardly that."
3,"Good Book, but too short","I enjoy Lois Lowry's books, but this one was nothing compared to The Giver. It started out wonderful, and I loved most of it, but it ended far too soon. The author seemed to have just tired of writing it and decided to end at the most climatic point. If you really want to read a good book, read The Giver or Book of Memories. If you would like to read this, get it from the library, because you'll probabaly only read it once."
2,"More Like ""Gathering Boring""","After being blown away by Lois Lowry's masterpiece ""The Giver"", I was thouroughly dissapointed in this follow up. The world is far from perfect, and although longer than the Giver, there are a lot of plot holes. There were not many twists (and I guessed the twists) or ""revealings"" of the world, but the plot moved very, very slowly. The best charachter is... Well, the charachter I liked was Thomas, the carver. The book is not horrible, but people expecting another Giver should go in with lower expectations. For a change, the hero is now a girl, and the world has technologically regressed. All in all, pretty boring."
5,Amazing Book,An amazing heartfelt book about a young girl wanting to weave blue because her mother wished to weave blue..
3,Gathering Blue,"The book I read was Gathering Blue. It was about a girl with a twisted leg. Her name is Kira. When she was a small tyke (a small kid)she started to weave. as she got older her mother got terribly sick and died. Now Kira is alone. Vandara (an evil lady that wants Kira dead.)wanted Kira to die and for Vandara herself take her land. The court decided for Vandara to take the land.As for Kira she did not die but has to fix the singers robe. along the way. She meets Annabella, Thomas and Matt also she sees her dad which se thoght was deadI kinda liked the book because it was like a mystery of life and I really like that. Also when she finally sees her dad when she thoght he was dead!? I also didn't care for it because in some places all she talked about was weaving. I would recomend this for 10 yrs. and older.I give this book 3 stars!!!"
3,"Great, but not a fan of the end","I enjoyed the the book, a good short read. However, I was disappointed in the end. I did purchase the second book thinking it was a continuation but it is not."
3,Good fast read,"A good, fast read. I'm not sure how it goes in with The Giver besides the basic premise, but still a wonderful day read. Can't wait to read the next!"
3,Amazing lead in to a disappointing ending,"I was captivated throughout this book, the whole time wondering where it was leading and what would become of the characters Lowry so artistically crafted and makes you fall in love with. And then it just ends. No answered questions, hardly a resolution at all. I was very disappointed at the end, and searched hoping to find a sequel or something. Happily, there is one! I'm definitely planning on getting it, hopefully it'll answer some questions!"
4,Good Read,"""Gathering Blue"" is part two of a three part trilogy of a post apocalyptic world. ""Gathering Blue"" focuses on the struggle for life in a small village after the ""fall"" and what makes a person important. The main character Kira, is born lame and should not have survived until the start of this story, but she has a talent as a seamstress and village elders have need of her skills. Much like ""The Giver"", this book focuses on a study of society and trying to come to an answer. Because this book is aimed at young adults, most of the baser behaviors are only hinted at, which actually make them more horrible because it has been left to the imagination. Much like all good reads, the giver leaves one with more questions than answers. ""Gathering Blue"" is an enjoyable read for both early teens as well as adults. It is a good start for young adults to start to read and question the role of society for them and in general the larger population."
4,Not that difficult,"I studied this guide for a couple of hours a day for a week and passed with a 71. I do have a background in management but that didn't help much. I studied a lot of material that did not end up being on the test. It is a good idea to study all of the management theorists but there were not as many questions about them as I expected. I would also recommend studying the terms found in management textbook to fill in some of the gaps in the REA guide (such as total quality management). Focus on the practice tests. Overall, it's a pretty easy test."
5,My daughter and I eat it every morning,My daughter and I love the stuff. I add a little bee pollen and flax see and quickly warm it up in the microwave for a quick breakfast.
4,Really cool!,"After buying confield I wasnt too sure whether my money would be spent wisely on this one but I was soon pleased to know that this is a great little disc. It only has 3 tracks but none of them are really terrible like some people here think. I think it's definetely a different approach than confield thankfully and assuming the amazon[.com] release has the dvd included with it, you MUST get it because you'll be holding in your hand simply one of the most impressive multimedia presentations : D"
3,key drawback,"The SongBook was in most ways excellent. However, it lacked key features for listening to distant stations. It needs an antenna jack and a switch to turn off the AFC. For these reasons, I returned it."
5,How good is the sound?,"The speaker is great. But it still limits the performance of the radio. Plug a pair of Sennheiser 595 headphone into the radio, then tell me how you feel about it."
1,Insomniacs need not apply...,"Well, the Songbook is a great radio. But I needed a clock radio with an alarm, and it just so happens that sometimes I can't sleep and so in the middle of the night I turn on the radio--BBC and better news and all that. Believe it or not, that cancels the alarm. Once you set the alarm, that's it for the Songbook for the night. Then there's the problem that if you just leave the radio on all night, it's the radio frequency that takes up most of the readout. The time is teenyweeny in the corner of the display. I pretty much know what station I'm listening to without looking, but I might want to know what time it is in the middle of the night. Like I said, buy it for the radio, not the clock."
2,the lid of the earphone's part in the ear fell off,"the sound is clear, but the lid of the earphone's part in the ear fell off several days ago, So it is very comfortable to use it now and I don't think the processing quality is good enough."
2,Don't waste your money,Very dissapointed with product. It looks like they took 5 year old program technology and put a new wrapper on it. Anybody that loves this product either works for Better Homes or hasn't taken their medication.
3,"*** EXCEPTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ! *** Jan 25, 2005","This software Better Homes and Garden Suite 6 appears to be the(EXCEPTIONAL) best on the market for the 100. doller range. The drafting, CAD, or technical basics for some featurs have major(RESTRICTIONS). Roof design or pitch for starters. The (PRO) version appears to be less restrictive, except for the 1/4"
3,Probably good for most purposes,"I read many reviews of home design programs before buying this one. Although it installed and ran without any problems (on Windows 2000), I was unable to accomplish what I wanted with it, which was draw some designs involving wooden beam structures, and flat Santa Fe style roofs. It seems that one can only draw the high level objects that it has preprogrammed, and cannot draw arbitrary objects. I also found it impossible to draw walls of thichnesses other than the dimensions preprogrammed (e.g., I wanted a 12"" thick wall, but the only choices were something like 6 and 9""). The program claims to have ""full CAD ability"", but this appears to be only 2D CAD, not 3D CAD.This program is probably good if you can use the objects built in (i.e., their walls, roofs, etc)."
1,Horrible support and customer service.,"After installing it I tried watching the tutorial video for getting started, but it didn't work and there was no error message. I used the email support option and received no response. After calling their non-toll-free tech support line I was told that even though I'm allowed to install on drives other than C:, I shouldn't. Now I have to root through the file system to find the videos I want. Second issue, I call customer support and ask them for a replacement CD. They say 'no problem, it'll be there in 3-5 days.' 2 weeks later, nothing. So I call them back and they told me they couldn't receive the fax I sent them so they didn't do anything. Apparently they have no record of my registration of the product, and didn't record the fact that I needed a new CD. Oops on my part for assuming they had a customer database.Scott"
1,Avoid like the plague,This was as disappointing of a book as I've bought. I have found much better material on the internet for free. I own an English language school in Japan and this book is utterly useless. It might be of some use to you if your idea of teaching is to photocopy boring worksheets and pray that nobody notices. This book is a waste of money. There is nothing of value (...)
1,terrible,"John Bertalot lives in a fairy-tale-Whenever John Bertalot encounters a problem with his choirs, he has an immediate solution and tada! it works flawlessly. It feels like JB has never been in real life situations where something might not work.-His writing style is irritating. Instead of a useful textbook, he tries to make his points with a story about a pupil who visits him. We have to read through very uninteresting descriptions of what they have for dinner, where they do their shopping..."
3,Maui Babe,"This is a very different type of tanning oil. It is all natural and the color you get is dark and brown in a short time, but the texture is differnt, thicker than normal tanning oils. I like it but dont use it every time I tan."
2,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,"My old Avent Isis that my sister loaned to me broke, so I went out looking for a replacement. I selected this Evenflo pump, because it seemed to look the most like the Isis. Apparently, all pumps are NOT created equal. When I used to pump with the Isis, my milk came out so easily, quickly, and with no discomfort. With this one, after about 20 minutes I had only one ounce out of each, my hand was so tired, and I was sore. Didn't seem to matter which setting I had it on, or whether I had the horn insert in or not. It also recommended hand expressing to begin with, before I began pumping...but didn't really think that was practical, since most of the time I will be using this in public bathrooms, while my little one is at home with Dad. I went online and spent the extra $ to order a new Avent Isis."
3,"it works, but not all that well...","i didn't plan on pumping all that often, therefore, i bought this pump based on simplicity and price. i'm not pumping in the mornings to provide extra milk for baby when i'm away. it takes a lot of work to use this pump... the handle doesn't pop back out once depressed, the rubber ring/gasket pops out of place quite often, the dial doesn't do anything to the level of suction offered. i still get milk into the bottle, but it seems like it shouldn't be so awkward and time-consuming to do so."
3,"Good, but not a blast","The Harvard Guide to Psychiatry have what it takes to be a good psychiatry reading, but I believe that it has failures in the interpretation of some topics. But by the other hand, is very comprensible and easy to read. If you are planning to buy only one psychiatry book (you are an student or just wanna look out) this might be not the best option. But if you really like psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and have other titles in your shelf, this book is a must read."
2,pinstripe,"poorly made,paper backing is hard to get off tape,end up wrinkling up tape to get it off...would reccomend buying a better product."
3,Trimbrite Pinstripe tape,"After getting the tape started, which is NOT very easy by the way, I found the tape to be great. However, I couldn't find the length of the tape roll upon ordering it. It comes in a 36' roll and why that isn't easily displayed just seems brainless.PROS: tape works great upon application and sticks well to the proper surface.CONS: difficult to start the tape when first opened, and the length of the roll is not easily displayed when purchasing the tape."
3,orange monster winder,"This watch works well for diving and it seems to keep good time, but only if you wear it every day. The self winding mechanism sometimes won't even keep the watch going overnight if you haven't worn it all day."
2,Winding Does not Last for Long,"This is a nice looking watch, with a real ""man"" feel, but unless you will be wearing it every day for the whole day (for self-winding), you will need to set the time again every time you wear it, since the ""wind life"" does not last long. I still like the watch, but am surprised it has such high reviews with this issue."
5,Seiko orange Monster SKX781,"this watch is a comfortable, workhourse with a great finish and one of the strongest bands in the business. I have owned a Black faced Monster for years, fault free, so orange was on my radar. for the price you will not find a better watch."
1,Didn't work,Had heard great things about this watch. The one I received never worked. Even Seiko repair shop had no idea why it would never start. Big thanks to Amazon customer service.
2,WARNING- Watch is NOT AS PICTURED,"I just received this watch today and it is NOT as pictured here on Amazon. I find this to be deceptive, as the watch you will receive has a black rubber strap and NOT the steel bracelet as shown. I'm requesting a return from the vendor and will try to find the actual watch I thought I was purchasing. It does seems like a great watch. This is a rare misstep for Amazon."
5,"Wonderful watch, agonizing band adjustment","This is a very solid watch. The positive comments are true. The only downside is that the glow in the dark spots fade quickly. Well, that and the wristband adjustment.I'm really writing this review to help people with band adjustment. If you can wait, I would suggest going to a jeweler. If you can't, like I couldn't, then you need to search for help on the internet. The links are are joined with a pin and collar system. Unless you're a pro, it's tedious and time consuming.Best wishes for enjoying your new Orange Monster."
2,not god value for the buck,the seiko monster orange divers watch i purchased does not keep acurate time it loses approx 5 minutes per day and must be re set. have a walmart 10.00 throw away sport watch its more accurate not to impressed with purchase.
3,Watch,"Did not read the fine print, decided watch was too large on wrist, saw restocking fee.... kept it and sold it on e-bay.."
3,Good overview on everything written re: gnostic discoveries,"This is a good, solid overview of everything written about the gnostic discoveries. I think the book could be stronger with a bit more detail enhancement on the discoveries in addition to a review of other authors' books on the subject."
3,Definitely not one of Jaime Bayly's bests.,"This is an interesting book by Jaime Bayly in the sense that it's just a serious of confessions in the form of letters that were written to various people who were a part of his life at one point of time and in the letters he expresses repent, sorrow, sentimental feelings etc. The book comes across as one in which Jaime Bayly once again reveals the intimacies and at this point complexities of his life. However, what are consistent in this book and others of his that I have read are his language skills and his unique way of expressing himself, which I think, is his strongest attribute. In a nutshell, this is a book with no real plot and the letters written to various friends he once had do not necessarily relate to each other. If you like Jaime Bayly it may be a worthwhile read otherwise you may want to read his other more credible works such as: Yo amo a mi mami and No se lo digas a nadie."
4,ESTA MUY BIEN,"Este libro me parecio bueno, no asi excelente.Yo he leido libros de Baily mucho mejores, como ""La noche es virgen"".Lo que si no entiendo es como gente de su pais, Peru, utilice este medio para hablar tan mal de su paisano, ¿quizas sienten odio por la forma en que Baily expresa las verdades sobre Peru en sus novelas?.Por favor, sus compatriotas usen otros medios para hablar mal del escritor, pero no este.El escritor que no saca criticas de su pais (aunque sean minimas)no es buen escritor.Repito, este libro me gusto.En el, a traves de unas cartas que no llegan a su destino, el protagonista siente con nostalgia la perdida de esos amigos que se supone que el perdio.Incluso, ahonda muy bien su bisexualidad."
5,Fantastic!,The product arrived within two weeks of purchase and was in great condition. This is a beautiful soundtrack from an amazing musical. Love anything by Alan Menken!
3,"Its Good, but its disney.","If you read my reviews you will find I am not a fan of Disney on broadway. Mainly becasue disney uses asthetics more than music or scripts to make their shows work. Beauty and the Beast is one of the many movies to broadway, and while it is nothing special (just like the movie) the Beast IS amazing. On this recording his voice is the best I have ever heard. ""If I Can't Love Her"" is so gut wrenching. So what I'm saying is, if you own the movie, and arent really into broadway, dont bother getting this CD. If your a collector, or a baritone looking for songs, this CD has one or two for you, and is worth the price. Favorite Song: ""If I Can't Love Her"""
5,Funkalicious!,"I got this CD at Tower at one of these ""as seen on TV!"" displays -- cover looked really cheesy but when I got home I was *delighted* at the music! Pretty much the entire CD is jampacked with absolutely delicious grooves guaranteed to make you ""shake your groove thing, yeahyeah!"""
2,Not pure.,I would have liked it had the songs been from the singers that I remember performing them. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,folding door damaged,I really like the door and how eazy it was to install. But when it arrived the door was damaged. The packaging should be better.
2,damaged,"When the door came it was bent in the box and it was cracked at the bottom of the door. Not wanting to bother returning, I kept it anyway and hung it in the bathroom."
4,Good version of this fairy tale,"I thought this version of the fairy tale was very well written. This is probably my favorite version out of the ones I have read before. It has been my favorite fairy tale since I was just a young little boy. I always liked to hear my mother and school teacher read the story out loud. My favorite part used to be when the ogre said, ""Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!"" I remember when my kindergarten teacher used to walk around like a monster when she read that part. The pictures in this version are also a couple of the better ones I've seen in other versions of the fairy tale. I thought the author of the book was one of the best because he was pretty good at telling the tale and he also used detailed pictures. The pictures would be enough to scare little ones and make them laugh at the same time. The pictures were probably some of the better ones you will see in other versions of this fairy tale."
3,Not as pictured,"These bottles are not clear, they are frosted with pictures of black scissors on them. They also have black nozzles."
4,The HAT!,"I really wanted to be a sexy sherlock last Halloween. So this year I finally ordered it. I thought it was pretty funny that this is a manufactured costume. Do that many people really want to dress up as a sexy female Sherlock Holmes? (more on this later)I bought a large and the fit was good. The material is polyester but it looks and feels better than you would expect. little to big on top but the cape covers that. I was disappointed in the hat. It was too big and didn't have all four flaps like the deerstalker is supposed to. The magnifying glass does not look like the one in the picture but it gets the point across. Doesn't come with a pipe, which I thought was necessary so I bought one for $3 at a costume store.People seemed to like the costume and I actually ran into two other Sherlock Holmes that night. One male and one female wearing a different sherlock outfit from mine.It's a cute costume and really not that slutty if you don't want to look like a total tramp. Neat!"
1,"Horrible, awful, and terribly twisted into a violent tale.","Watership down the book was as good as it got. What the hell did they think they were doing??? Look at the movie, it's violent, ugly, almost scary. The book is beautiful, sad, and for all ages. Get a life you stupid producers."
1,Bad transfer. What a dissapointment.,The transfer of this movie is bad. It's very noticeable at the beginning when Bigwig has an audience with the chief. The colors flicker and fade. It happens throughout the movie.I tried the DVD on three different machines and two different TV's.If you want the movie try to get a different release off eBay.Do not purchase this DVD. Warner Brothers needs to provide a corrected version.Otherwise the movie is great. :)Just to be fair to WB I had the movie replaced. Same issue.
3,preview before showing to children,the story is ok however this is not something i would show to young children. there is just too much violence for me to consider this to be a childrens program
3,Read the book first!!!,"If you haven't read the book, don't watch the movie!I really did enjoy the movie as it brought the characters in the book to life, but as I watched the movie for the first time, I started thinking that this movie would be a tad bit confusing if you didn't read the book. Of course, that's just me, so I may be wrong.Every piece of music in this film is absolutely beautiful! If I had easy access to getting the soundtrack, I'd get it for sure!Over all, I'll have to say it wasn't the greatest animated film I've seen, but a must have if you read the book. And as always the book was MUCH better than the movie."
1,Don't bother,"This movie is BAD! Some artsy fartsy, indy followers may appreciate it, but we did not. This is not a horror movie and it is not a comedy either. I would call it nothing or a waste of film... Its not scary at all and nothing made us laugh. It is 100% boring dialogue that goes no where with no action or anything... Who did not see that lame ending coming? The foreshadowing at the very beginning gave that away... We fast forwarded through the last 20 minutes of the movie and my wife wanted to turn it off after about 15 minutes. This movie seriously sucks and I would NOT waste your time or money (seriously)! Go see ""Taken"", ""The Wrestler"" or ""Gran Torino""."
3,Fair,"Even though picture shows enough space for pen and cold pack, it is a tight squeeze. Doesn't keep pen cool for very long"
1,God Awful Translation / Zero Stars,ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE. This is one of the grandest examples of a criminal translation. Utterly brutalized. Find a copy of the Zone Books publication 1995.
4,Good Deal,"It's a great headboard, but did not come with the screws to attach it to a metal bed frame. The instructions say to use the screws that came with your bed frame, but I have had the bed frame for 10 years, and I certainly don't remember any screws coming with it, nor would I know where they are if it had! Otherwise, the headbord looks great, I don't think it is too thin, or smells bad."
2,Wafer Thin,"Looks good in a picture, but if you want quality, I suppose you'll pay higher prices.It DOES smell strange. I'm waiting for the smell to disperse.I was disappointed by how thin it actually was.I kept coming back to the picture to see if it actually looked that thin here."
4,NOT YOUR BASIC LOVE STORY,"In the tradition on Bruges-la-Morte, Vertigo and All the Mornings of the World, Sobin's novel is a love story in which only one of the lovers continues to be alive. The narrative starts off as a bit of somber realism then becomes less so as Cabassac's love for his dead wife takes over the narrative. By the novel's end we are treading a vague terrain where one man's truth is another's madness. The Fly-Truffler is a compelling, but by no means cheerful, read."
4,Same as Paradise!,"Having read Paradise, checked for more Liza Marklund/Annika books - read the synposes, Vanished is the same book as Paradise!"
2,A little disappointed,"I though this would be a book version of the musical, but instead it is just the script of the musical."
1,Wrong Item!,"I received the wrong item from Amazon, though I was billed for this one. Instead of the all-inclusive book ($100), I received the 30 page ""musical selections"" book ($12). It seems that the wrong label was affixed to the item. Even though Amazon took it back, be careful. Try to make sure that you are going to receive the correct item."
5,fun...fun...fun!,I've seen this series for years and still have lots of fun memory with it (especially GRANMA!). Once I've heard that it's available in DVD format....there is no need to think twice!If you are her fan...you shouldn't miss it!
5,sam was the best,"what can you say about sam cooke? he was simply the best. no one before or since can match his talent. many people are only aware of his pop tunes. this collection shows his grittier gospel style.but whether singing gospel or pop, sam did it with style and grace and has influenced every soul artist that has come since."
1,i love pocahontas,This was very good.I liked it's type of contrast and all of the soundtracks that are on it are from all of my fave Disney films.
2,Over-priced and nothing new,I have always been leery of purchasing these types of books. This one just reinforces the suspicion that they are over priced and poorly written.
4,TOM SELLECK - EXCELLENT FILM,I agree whole heartedly with all the favourable comments. I really do hope they make more of these books and from viewing the special features on this dvd Mr. Selleck says that they have the go ahead to do more. Very good story - excellent acting throughout so please don't make us wait too long before film 2.
5,Stone Cold is a must,"Where big budget Hollywood movies fail to develop characters and give us cookie cutter sets, this made for tv movie raises the bar. Rich layers of atmosphere puts you right in Paradise (Mass. that is) and Tom Selleck was made for this part!"
4,good movie,a good movie but moves a little slow. Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and was good in this movie.
1,Absolutely worthless for independent students.,"This book should be entitled ""Paying For Your <i>Child's</i> College Without Going Broke"". It contains almost no information for one who is trying to pay their own way through college. In fact the information in this book is so insular, I'm led to believe that unless you're a clone copy of the author, you won't find any relevant information in this book whatsoever. This is a throwaway piece of tripe intended to capitalize on peoples' apprehension of college costs. There is nothing here you won't find elsewhere on the net."
3,The best of the three,"This video brings you fourteen Roller Coasters from all over the United States. The film had its drawbacks and some good features but not many. The good qualities: excellent car-mounted picture quality of the front row of most of the coasters, wide range of coasters shown, and interesting narrative. The bad qualities: Even though I acknowledge Superman the Escape is a Roller Coaster it is about half a minute long so I don?t know why it was put in there, Inside were two duelling coasters but they only showed the front-car view from one of the tracks (I think it would be better to see the other side of Duelling Dragons thank you), Medusa seems to be played at an incredibly high speed, and no one seems to recognise the different kinds of inversions there are. A batwing is a batwing, not a cobra roll."
5,Mountain Pine Student Desk w 4 drawers,"This arrived very quickly. Although the instructions were easily followed, I was unable to assemble it. A friend put it together and it took him 3 hours. There are about 18 pieces of wood and over 100 pieces of hardware.. It is definitely the most complicated piece I have ever tried to assemble. I recommend using a battery operated screwdriver if strength limitations are a factor. The desk is beautiful and the perfect size for a laptop computer, modem and mousepad."
4,Nice for the price,"I bought this for my son's room and it is a nice desk for the price. Seems sturdy and the drawers glide really nicely in the drawer glides. It looks nice and all pieces were complete and included and none were damaged. I would have given it 5 stars, but putting it together was a real pain as it took a long time and the directions could have been clearer. It wasn't too hard, just time-consuming and had to keep looking back at the directions repeatedly because it was kind of complex."
5,Excellent album!,"Got the Japansese remastered. The sound exploded through my speakers, bright, clear, precise. The way Roth plays.The album is dedicatd to jimi Hendrik, and there is no secret about the fact that Roth worships the guy.But this album is all Roth. Even his unusual vocals sound great here. The support band is solid, very good, and Roth's playing is one to mesmerize.I have only good things to say about this album, one of the best acquisitons I've made this year to my record collection.Band line-up:Uli Jon Roth-v,g; Ule Ritgen-b; Clive Edwards-d"
3,"Good drills, light on pictures/graphics","The list of drills are comprehensive, meets the needs of every position, and are well organized. The graphics are poor, and there are no support pictures. If this book is updated with better graphics, I would highly recommend."
2,too big,"I bought this to fit Canon Elph SD400, and it is too fat. I am returning it. It looks to be sturdy leather, but I am more interested in a snug fit."
2,PSC-50 is way better!!!,"I just got this and the psc-50, I think the psc-50 is way better in protecting your camera, I gots the sd500 and it totally fits in the psc-50, also it is waayyy cheaper. I will keep the coach case and use it for holding my small mp3 player when I jog!!! Peace"
2,It is ok to buy it.,"Nicely designed for those canon cameras. However, I got a pretty similar one (also good quality) in a 99c store. You can argue for better quality. However, I am still think that the quality/price ratio is low."
2,"Stylish I guess, but not a great case","[...] The leather is very hard, the lining is crap, and it rubs the finish off the camera's body. It also has no place for an extra battery or memory card. A great case for the rabid Coach brand fan, a mediocre to poor case for a camera user."
3,Not Quite Right,"The Coach made case for my Canon SD550 camera adds a bit of elegeance and not much protection. When worn on the belt, the profile is such that the camera hangs close to the body. The case is attached to the belt with a strong well sewn (no Velcro) leather loop that will not tear off. The case opens and closes using a relatively strong magnetic snap. However, this can open easily during normal walking. I think the magnetic snap should be replaced with a more positive locking device. Also, the camera sometimes binds to the edges of the case when putting the camera in. It works better using two hands which gets to be a pain in the butt. In addition, I think the case should have more padding and a softer feel instead of the ""card boardy, stiff feel"" that it does have."
3,Nice case,"Pros:Stylish case with coach logo on frontNice leather even though a bit hardDecent fit for the SD 500 cameraMagnetic clipExtra slot to put memory card but doesn't fit batteryCons:A bit on the bulky side - defeats the purpose of having a small cameraHeavier than the PSC 50 caseExpensiveNot as slim fitting as the Canon PSC 50 caseI bought both the Coach and Canon PSC 50 cases. Overall I like both of them but for different reasons. When i want to travel light, I will use the PSC 50 case, otherwise I'll use the Coach case ."
2,IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO RED SOMETHING JUST FOR FUN,"O.K IM GOING TO MAKE THIS SHORT AND SWEET. B- more careful is not the book to read if you are looking to read it in didactic form. I mean give me a break! all the twist and turns constantly kept me in focus with the realization of this book really being non-fiction. I may even go as far as to saying that it is a premier publicity stunt to capture the media eye. Dont get me wrong if thats what sells my hat is off to the arthur, but how about making the events as well as characters a little more realistic. If you are reading this for entertainment I recommend it. Its the typical Ghetto story that many writers write about this day and age. Girl meets another girl they form a clique, breaks up, get into drugs, one questions her physical apperance while the other is confident, they break up go separate ways get in trouble and by some troubling means they reunite in some sort the end."
2,I thought it was just me trippin on the grammer and spelling of some words,This book was not at all what i thought it would be it seemed like from the summary that the book would be about the group of girls in the so called gang but it was only about two of the girls they could have the other members out beside mimi n netta no one else seemed to hold a signifigance the books jumps around alot it starts off in the present then goes to the past then goes to someones else past and present then their future then back to netta and mimi but at least it lets you know the book was changing places in time because if i didnt i would be lost also the ending is HORRIBLE i just hated the way this book ended and the grammer was really bad i understand the use of ebonics but it was so many gramatical errors
1,NOTHING LIKE THE COLDEST WINTER EVER!!!!!,THIS BOOK IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO BEING BETTER THAN THE COLDEST WINTER EVER. B MORE CAREFUL HAS TOO MUCH GOING ON AT ONE TIME THE PLOT CHANGES TOO MUCH. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHARACTERS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MAIN CHARACTERS. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS A WASTE OF $ IF YOU REALLY WANT TO READ IT JUST BORROW IT (THAT MAY BE A WASTE OF TIME TOO). IT TOOK ME A MONTH TO READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT USUALLY TAKES ME ONE TO THREE DAYS.
2,THE EDITING SUCKED,"I really thought that this book was eventful. But someone should have checked for grammatical and spelling errors. And I'm not refering to the characters speech. I'm talking about the descriptive paragraphs. I found myself reading sentences 2 or 3 times just to understand what she was trying to say, only to find out that the sentence had grammatical errors."
3,R.A.W yet a delightful read,"Be Mo Careful was a pretty good book. It started off kind of slow, but the momentum picked up. This was the first book I've read about the underground drug world, and I must say it was quite enlightening.There was one thing in particular about the story that I feltwas wrong. The description of the story leads you to believe that the story was about the life of Netta, yet more backstory was given to ""Black's"" character."
3,A great book,"I just finished the book I found it to be excellent I agree with the other reviews regarding the editing but I understood it enough to enjoy it. I felt for Netta in the beginning when she was trying to survive I did not like her greedy, gold-digging ways I also did not like what she did to Black which she paid a heavenly price for but i glad she found love in Tone even though it ended up being tragic in the end but that goes to show what goes around comes around. Black was a man not to be played with I found him to be ruthless to some extent I felt for him especially when Netta betrayed him but he took it too far and also paid for it in the end. Mimi was a sad case I didn't like how she was very envious of Netta but that goes to show you beauty is only skin deep you have to love who you are on the inside and not look for someone to love you first. But it was a great read I hope to read more from MMP."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!,"This is one of the best books that I've read so far. Shannon Holmes and Terri Woods put thier thing down with this one. It's a ghetto tale with more twists and turns than the law allows. The main character Netta is a woman that you love to hate. She uses whoever she wants to get what she wants, and usually comes out on top until she uses the wrong somebody. Each character in the book has thier own personal struggles which eventually all lead them to each other with Netta being the common link. Netta thinks she smart and ahead of the game, but only when tradgey befalls her does she re-think her game plan.....but by then it's too late. She's too deep in the game, and now it's do or die!!"
3,A good read,"The book took too many different directions. The reader was left confused as to who was the main character. The characters got away with too much crime, making it unrealistic."
2,B-More Selective,"I wasn't at all impressed with this book. It felt like someone was telling a really bad B list movie. I mean the women in the story completely jutted that whole ""I'm a ho*"" factor about them. Honestly I think this was the story that got all the ""urban line"" of books started, and I really wish people would quit writing such nonsense. Give me a real fiction story, not one full of drugs, guns, death, cheating, prostitutes and things that glorify ghetto ism's. I see enough of that on the news, give me good quality books."
5,This book brings the real street drama!,"It's quite obvious in this book that Shannon Holmes is very familiar with the streets. This book was right on point. Having a brother who lived in D.C. for four years, I heard about things that happened similiar to the incidents in ""B-More Careful"" and many other incidents as well. Holmes doesn't sugar coat anything. This book is straight up raw. Even the part were the peeps from B-More ended everything with ""YO"" was right on target, because they definetely do that. I just could not put this book down until I finished it. Please believe, if you have to every deal with someone from the streets and need some insight, this is the book to read. That's what up!"
3,a fine 2 wheel piece,When I got this thing and started it up it did not work. But it was so what I wanted I took it all apart. I found out it was out of ajustment. How it got out of the factory thet way I do not know. It works fine now and it is every thing I expected. Just check them before you ship them.
3,Weed Eater,"Ordered the WT3100 weedeater on 8/25/09, received it on 09/01/09. The first time I tried to use it, it started fine but the bump head would not turn. Took it to a warranty dealer on 9/08/09 they had to replace the bump head which took a week. I picked it up on 9/16/09, took it home and it ran for about an hour and then it would start but would not stay running. Took it back to warranty dealer on 9/22/09, after 2 weeks found the carburetor had to be replaced. Picked it up on 10/6/09 and will try it again this weekend.Also when I purchased the unit I chose to purchase a new one not a used one. The person that worked on the unit told me it was not new it was an 07 model.Will never orde a product online again that I cannot return. Have had 3 of these weedeaters prior to this one but this is the last one.The other ones I had ran ok, but started cable broke about every other month."
1,Gas line problems,"It worked well out of the box until it ran out of gas. After refueling, I pumped the primer whereupon it collapsed. The unit worked for a while, but gradually the engine seemed sluggish and unresponsive, and eventually petered out. I took it to a dealer (ditto the Weedeater customer service info problems mentioned) who replaced the primer bulb (its collapse created a vacuum that deprived the engine of fuel, he said). It worked well until it ran out of gas. Halfway through the second tank I noticed the same engine problems gradually appearing, and the primer bulb seemed spongy. Perhaps it would be better to say the vacuum collapsed the bulb the first time. This time it went back to Amazon."
3,Powerful but Light,"This is a good product, however it is limited to where you can use it. I still use my old Robi for the tough stuff. Has plenty of power but eats up line if you run it fast. Ideal for small yard or old folks that can't carry a weed-eater around."
2,trimmer head want turn,Trimmer head want turn. See my comments in the online forum for this product.
2,dissatisfied customer,"I Liked the easy of use and the unit is light enough to maneuver on steep banks.Now for the negative; I used two strings in about 5 minutes of use, after about ten minutes the string head seperated at the welds a bad design flaw I guess."
1,Won't buy this brand again,"$31.00 for a piece of angled plastic.I had to use my own 3M tape because theirs only touched 1/16"" of the top of the beds bulkhead.Going to use a heat gun and try to make a u channel for a better fit."
2,Not nearly as good as the original replacement filters.,"Every year we replaced our filters with the ones sold at Sears. They worked great. We usually got the humidifier to pump an entire five gallon bucket of water into the air each day during the first few days of use each winter. Once the air was comfortable, the humidifier would turn itself on and off depending on the humidity. These new filters have been in there for two days and the humidifier cannot bring the house up to the usual comfort level (and it's not that cold yet - and it's raining!) It has been running non-stop. During the first day, it only drew about three gallons of water out into the air. Very disappointing.BTW, the only reason we switched to these filters was because our Sears went out of business."
2,Lexus ES300,"This manual is really junk. Although the title says its for a Lexus ES300, the manual almost in its entirely covers the Toyota Camry. Pics are also 99% of the Toyota Camry with none of it covering the Lexus. Trim on a Lexus vehicle are completely different from a Toyota, yet the manual only shows pic for Toyota Camry 4/6 cycl model. I will not recommend this manual if you own a Lexus but may recommend it only if you have a Toyota."
1,Too bad this is the ONLY tech manual... I feel robbed.,"Not enough detail in this book. I wanted to replace the drivers side front wheel bearing and the manual indicated that I would need special tools and expertise required only of a professional shop. Well, I replaced it anyway. The book is too generic in other cases, too many pages of general automotive knowledge in this book. There are not enough illustrated parts diagrams (exploded views) nor are there any detailed schematics of most systems. I am upset that I wasted $25 on this book. I guess if you want the most generic information possible then this book is for you. I should have known better, I have bought Haynes manuals before and they were mostly a waste of money and this is proof that Haynes manuals still suck."
1,whats going on...,i returned this thing and still havent gotten my money back. what the hell is going on. hows that for a review....
4,09 Edition?,"Amazon: Local library refuses to accept the book you sent as replacement for theirs, claiming theirs was an 09 edition, superior to the earlier edition you sent me. Have you an 09 or later?"
3,I use it every day with some minor adjustments,"When I make my coffee in the morning I use a 4-cup paper filter with 2 tablespoons of coffee. I fill the water up to the 4 cup mark. I have no idea why 2 mugs of coffee equals 4 on the scale. In the afternoon I may make tea by putting a tea bag in place of the coffee and filter. Usually I fill to the 3 cup mark for about 1 1/2 cups.To clean any coffee stains or residue in the pot, I use a little bleach in water and a non-abrasive scrubber. Sometimes there is a little water that leaks beyond the drip hole in the pot and runs out onto the counter. When pouring, I avoid the spout spillage by holding the top of the carafe open. I have gotten a buildup on the hot plate over time. I have had good success with Toastmaster products in the past but this one is a disappointment."
3,Makes coffee but messy to pour,"The coffeepot always spills coffee out of the side of the spout when pouring coffee. The spout shape should be deeper to avoid spilage. I always have to pour the coffee over a sink. Other than this issue, it works. I would definitely not buy this again."
4,Fun to use for a Thomas the Train fan,My grandson likes to have his friends close to him while he eats. Just wish the placemat was a little thicker.
5,Capitol idea!,An excellent set of the classic Addams Family series! Can't wait for series three to complete the set!!
4,"Lifes Instructions for Wisdom, Success and Happiness","The condition of the book was like new but I was surprised that the shape was different than the book I have. I was giving it as a gift as everyone that reads mine, wants it. I have great joy knowing when or if I need another, I will go directly to Amazon.com.Jan"
5,German 80's rock at it's finest,"This was one of my favorite bands back in the 80's. I wore out my vinyl it was played so much, glad I finally found it on cd."
4,Gold City is Southern Gospel's Number One group!,"If you like southern gospel... if you like quartets... if you like Gold City... you are going to like this album! I found this album a little different from their last recording (""Are You Ready?""... which was the #1 album of the year) and it took me a few times of listening to get to appreciate it... but it has grown on me. I like it.These guys really know how to make a recording and put on a concert! Don't miss the opportunity to see them in person."
4,Demuestreme Su Carta Verde,"Both my Sons are Border Patrol Agents. This cap is not ""Official"" but it gets the message across. Good piece of equipment. Good quality."
1,Caligula: Divine Garbage,"This is the most inaccurate account of the Roman emperors I have ever read. It is also one of the least academic. The authors refer to ""documents that have recently been discovered"" as the basis for their facts but NOWHERE do they tell you where to find these ""documents"". Anyone with the least bit of intelligence will also know that their description e.g. of the sexual behavior of spectators at the gladiatorial games is far-fetched and made up and sensational, to say the least. Their description of how some gladiators were so well trained that they could decapitate another, and have the blood spurting out of his neck then form the letters of the name of the emperor, is absolutely ludicrous. It is a pity that a book like this exists -do NOT waste your money on this book."
2,weak.,very cliched and cheesey. the romance wasn't all that exciting either...there is no real suspense. sometimes the heroine acts unrealistically for her situation.
2,VERY POOR WRITING,"WHILE I DON'T EXPECT ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE WRITING STYLE, I DO EXPECT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY OF HIS WRITING. THIS SEEMED LIKE SECOND YEAR LITERATURE STUDENT WRITING. NEITHER GOOD NOR STYLISH. AT $0.99 IT WOULD NOT BE A BARGAIN. I HOPE SOME OF YOU LIKE IT.(sorry, i didn't mean to leave the caps lock on)"
1,I HATE THIS MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY,"This is horrible. It hurts to take it off and LEAVES nasty crap from the strip on my skin. Maybe its just me...i don't know but if I could go back and NOT buy this, I would."
2,Doesn't work!,I followed their insturctions and watched their video to makes sure I was doing it right - doesn't work. Either removes my skin - but not blackheads! - or leaves behind sticky glue all over my nose.
5,Great,"These really work for my face. I love this brand! They were a little costy but totally worth it:) I always refer people with face problems, to buy these"
4,Really good for a few blackheads.,"I actually like this product, it is so easy to use and makes you feel so clean and refreshed. It definitely does a great job removing black heads. This product is not so great for really deep black heads which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I wish this was a little cheaper, I don't feel like it's really worth $1 each. I would recommend getting the 14 ct for about $1 more than the 8 ct. Overall, I would point a friend towards this product."
1,Only got to a few pores.,"We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn't remember what brand it was so I bought these instead. We were totally disappointed. It pulled stuff out from maybe 10 pores onto the strip. We felt as though this product was poor quality. If I had bought it at a store I probably would have returned it, but since it's online I don't want to go through the hassle of shipping it back. Waste of money. Would not buy again."
2,What's this supposed to do again?,"Couldn't resist giving this product a free star due to the cool feeling when drying on your nose...Otherwise, the results are pretty laughable. I'd recommend trying another product instead."
2,Didn't work for me :(,"My friend raved about these strips and convinced me to try them..I did, and nothing happened! I have an average about of blackheads around my nose and I thought the strips would get rid of them and I'd be able to see all the black gunk on the strip. I followed the directions to the T and yet they didn't remove any blackheads. The strip was clean when I took it off...and let me tell you, pulling the strip off hurts so bad!! My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.My nose was pretty smooth after though...but I don't think it was worth it. I will not buy these again."
4,great product,"this is a great and easy to use product, simple directions are included. i love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon, and for a very fair price. you can actually see the dirt come off when you peel the strip off."
1,Did not clean out my pores,"These strips get almost nothing out of my pores, and make no visible difference. There is still gunk in my pores after using them. I tried using hot water on my nose before applying to open my pores, but that didn't help at all. I will not be purchasing these again."
1,The don't stick!!,Don't buy this product. It is a waste of money. The strips don't stick and fall of 3 secs after
3,Just wash your face!,"I didnt find this product to work very well for me. If you wash your face regularly with something that can scrub and not just hands, this won't do much for you. It wont pick up the smaller black heads either. All I can say is wash your face regularly if your worried about black heads and you can save your $15 on this."
4,Work pretty well,"These work pretty well. You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick. Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much. However, I've used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there. The nose is fine, though. When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip. The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off. It doesn't get rid of everything, but it definitely helps."
2,doesnt work,"maybe its just me, but these dont do anything for me.i have big pores so i get a lot of dirt in my pores and these do jack all for removing it."
3,Works but doesn't get them all,"These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads but just not all of them. Ive tried it a few times and it still won't get everything out. Its says on the box only to use on your nose but I tried it on my forehead anyways and it worked fine. Just like my nose though it didn't get everything out."
2,Item different than shown,"Picture of item misleading--image of a box clearly shows 7 bulbs and states ""7 bulbs"". Instead of 7 bulbs, I received a different, smaller box than pictured, containing only 3 bulbs.Keep looking for other sellers of Bubblelights. I noticed on Amazon there are sets of 3 for $3.99 -- less than half of the cost of these and shipping is also less. Set of 7 can be also be had for less (including shipping $9.99 + 7.00 sh/h)."
5,Replacement for night light,"My daughter has a nite light, she has had it for years. She left it on the table and her cat knocked it off...broken. I was so glad to find these and replace her lite."
1,blue bulb did not bubble,the Blue bulbs do not bubble. The red and yellow blubs worked good but the blue bulb did not work
4,Works as it should,"I needed a long cable to reach around my room from my stereo to computer, works as it should, no complaints."
4,Great Euro dance music,"Anyone who has played the Konami hit Dance Dance Revolution probably has heard this song, ""Hero"" by Miss Papaya, a veteran of the game with many other songs on the DDR track, including ""Pink Dinosaur"" and ""Cinderella."" Definately worth a try."
3,Nice beat but terrible voice,"No her voice isn't that bad, but the whole thing sorta sounds like an AQUA rip-off. I am talking about ""HERO"" so I don't know about the whole album."
5,This ANNOITED Man of GOD has done it again!!!,"The music of this album is a today generation type of music. The crossover is dynamic. And with an all-star cast of R, Mary J, Fred Hammond, Rance Allen, and Men of Standard, this album is going to touch and heal a lot of confused, battered souls!!! To God be the Glory for Kirk to allow the Lord to use him!!!"
4,Good CD,"This CD is a good CD to listen to, but you have to be in the mood. Most of it is really upbeat. It is a good CD and it has a great message in it's songs. If you like rap, get this CD. If you don't get it anyway, it's a great CD."
4,"An Excellent, Lively Performance","A guy from Sudan recently enrolled in my school and brought this CD to school where my drama teacher played it between classes. According to the guy, this is popular music in Sudan. And I can't imagine why it isn't more popular in the United States. It's got rhythm and a nice message. It's 100% better than that Britney Spears style preppy band act that I am getting so tired of. This album is definately the best Christian album I've heard. I really like the unique style, and the background chorus will get you dancing. It definately has a hip-hop theme, which explains why it's so popular in Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands (at least someplace in America loves it.) Hurry and buy it today!"
2,perfect 'starter kit' for non-believers and baby Christians,"There is much merit in this recording for Babes in the faith walk. It will make you tap and feel good, and, on occassion, it does focus on the true reason why we should all have a hope. It conveys basic truth about the effects of Jesus in a format which is not 'heavy' nor threatening to the non-believer/Baby Christian and, from that perspective, it is an excellent album. However, if you're looking for spiritual upliftment this supreme production will not assist as it is sorely lacking in its incorporation of the Word of God which, in my view, characterises other 'successful' Gospel Albums. This is a slick production without the real 'Power' and, consequently, it is disappointingly limited. Nevertheless,it has its place in drawing the young and weak. But make no mistake this is Milk (high tech, funky urbanised beat, with all the latest bells and whistles) but still Milk and not Meat. A good witnessing tool but, it won't feed your Spirit."
4,Awesome Gospel,"I am a 15 year old female, and out of all my Cd's this is my favorite! I listen to it before every one of my bsketball games! The songs on it really motivate me and pump me up!"
3,Great phone - beware the rebate trap,"Fantastic, reliable phone that far surpasses the Treo. Look VERY CAREFULLY for the rebate though. I didn't find it initially, called Amazon support line 3 times for assistance without getting through, and finally lost the rebate because time had lapsed. In my view the rebate should be obvious or even automatic."
4,organize hair care,Given as a Bithday present Loves it has a place to put hair dryerinstead of on sink. Very useful.
5,MANUAL,THE SHOP MANUAL IS QUITE COMPLETE. IT HAS DIAGRAMS AND INFORMATION ABOUT ENGINE REBIULDING SPECS AS WELL AS TRANSMISSION SPECS. A GOOD BOOK FOR REFERENCE ON THESE OLD CADILLACS.
1,"terrible, go back to the original","Fall Out Boy has gone way down hill since Take This To Your Grave. Its to poppy and emo, the new stuff is made for girls. I wish they'd go back to the more upbeat sound with a little screaming like in ""Saturday"" this new stuff is trash"
4,"Infinity On High-good,not great","This record to me is just Patrick(the singer) showing off his voice. On Take This To Your Grave I felt some deeper meaning but From Under the Cork Tree and Infinity On High seem to lack this. Still great hooks due to Patrick's amazing voice, but the music is just unique,good lyrics and Patrick singing well. I still enjoy Fall Out Boy but this record wasn't playing constantly weeks after I bought it like Take This To Your Grave did(and is, Take This To Your Grave is my favorite album to date). So if you are like me, enjoy the hooks and go back to their earlier works."
4,Ignore the Scenesters . . .,"who decry FOB selling out, and the lead singer sounding ""like the guy from Maroon 5,"" this is actually a pretty good CD.I'll admit I jumped on the Fall Out Boy bandwagon after their last CD, but good music is good music regardless of when you found it or how.The vocals are pretty top notch, especially for the genre. The production can be a bit overwrought at times, but overall the CD is enjoyable.Give it a try, you'll enjoy it. It's good to see a band that doesn't take themselves too seriously.Recommended tracks:This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms RaceI'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You OffHum Hallelujah've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers"
2,Not That Great Of A CD!!!,"I Thought This CD Wasn't As Good As The Others! Their Were Only About 3 Decent Songs On This Album To Me.I Wouldn't Waste Your $ On The CD!*This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race*Thnks Fr Th Mmrs*Fame-Infamy"
5,BEST EVER!,"Trini's songs are down to earth and talk about the common people like ourselves. We have met him and his family numerous times and have enjoyed their company each time. We wish the Houston radio stations would play him more often, as often as the DJs at the clubs. Trini hurry up and put out AUTUMN LEAVES on tape and a full cd. We loved that song ever since we heard it in Dec.'99. WE LOVE YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Connie and Kristal"
4,Excellent series,Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This season seemed to be a bit slow and low on the effects budget. But still good fun.
1,Stupidity squared,"I can't say how bad this episode is, but... it sucked so very, very much. The whole Atlantis series was a scab on SG-1's ass, but this episode brought the stupidity of SG-1's 9th and 10th seasons worst to the new show."
3,Stargate Atlantis Season 2,"I bought this as a gift. It is not as good as the original SG-1 series, but, if it is requested, I have no problem buying it...."
3,Good Average Video These Days,"Commentaries on every episode (but most by writers, directors, etc). Some by Actors, but most by Directors. Still they were interesting, and some of the comments were interesting, especially Joe Flanigan's commentary on Conversion. Overall, the commentaries added to the viewing and didn't detract or distract. Would have liked the Inline Video Commentaries like on the Doctor Who Series Two, so we could actually see the people while they're watching the show. No Deleted Scenes (which is why gave this 3 stars instead of four). Especially, missed seeing some deleted scenes referred to in the commentaries. Overall, this is worth $30-$35 price. Would have felt disappointed if it had cost much more."
3,i do like this show,i've liked the stargate series from the begining.most of the actors are just great and i look for the next series Pat R.
3,The good news is...,"If your looking at this review, your a big fan of Fish, which means you will enjoy this. While the audio quality is not quite as good as the other ""official"" bootleg, there are some gems here."
2,Hit and Miss,"I have to say that I loved Mace, a real hottie with a heart as good as gold. Alas, our heroine Becka comes off as a complete witch, who never has any faith in him and treats him like a stereotype. The author pumps up the sexual tension, hen leaves him and everyone else dangling, just because she blows hot and cold and really cold.The book starts out well and you can tell the author likes baseball a lot, but they deal with a lot of issues outside the couple, so much so that the couple's affair takes a back burner every single time to the latest crisis with the team.I would love to have seen a real development of character from both people. The near end of the relationhip was terrible-sensationalist rubbish, and if I had been Mace I would have just kept on walking away from her, because Becka sure wasn't worth it."
3,Grinch,I mainly bought this game for my kids. I got what I wanted and the kids enjoy the game when they play.
3,heavy to read,"I had some expectation about thsi book, because i read the other one of this author, but the languaje in this one was very technical and I got bored very soon."
5,Great feel,"I'll keep this short: I push aside all the Craftsman wrenches in my toolbox to find these Crescents. Well actually, they sit on top of the Craftsmans because they are my #1 choice."
3,Disappointing,I had high hopes for this dvd but it came across as amateurish. It was filmed around same time as the other performance dvds. Zoe Jakes and Ava Fleming dance to same song in different performances. Mira Betz unfortunately performs a whirling Dervish routine which is very boring. Who wants to see some spin in circles? The other performances were very good though.
4,Great little action gem,"Well it's more of a diamond in the rough. The low budget shows but fortunately, the sheer brilliance of the action scenes carry this movie. I would like to see the lead actor do more movies, with better production values."
3,could've been more impressed,"hi. I think that Nikki Leonte's album ""Shelter me"" is pretty good. I really like her song ""Shoelaces"" I just thought it was perfect for how most schools are getting to be. I mean almost everyone is trying to run with the crowd, when what they should be doing is getting closer to God. Over all the album would get about 3 and a half stars from me."
5,Totally Encouraging,"Nikki Leonti is a brand new 16 year old artist who joined with pamphlin records. Her latest album, ""shelter Me"" is encouraging, energetic, and totally praise worthy. One song, which has really inspired me, is her song, ""Every Moment"". In this song, Nikki proclaims her love of the gift of life. The whole album is powerful-a light pop style-sure to be loved by anyone in Christian Contemporay music. Give it a listen today!!"
3,boring,It was kind of boring but I wanted to find out what happened so I kept reading it. I seemed to have an impersonal touch.
2,Check the details - Copyright 1924,The book was interesting if you consider the context. It was written in the 1920's and is not very useful except as an interesting review of old ideas. I do not know how I missed catch the age. It is a shame we have not made more progress in this area but we have made a lot and this is pretty worthless.
4,Good Bubble wrap,"Well thnere isnt't much to say about bubble wrap, except that I have used much worse. Duck Brand is very good quality, it is not ripped, or filled with busted bubblesAs described 175 feet of small bubbles, and it does the job of protecting your fragiles"
1,Perforations missing?,"This product is described as being perforated, and I can find some of the perforations. But they are very hard to see, if they really are there consistently. Most of the time, I end up cutting to get a clean edge.I've used several kinds of bubble wrap in large rolls (including this brand, I thought), and find perforations necessary for efficient use.So I'm disappointed. I would think about returning this, but can't quite imagine mailing such a huge roll. Also, I need bubble wrap right now, so need to hang on to this, even though I have to use scissors."
5,Excellent,I love Michael Jackson. I am never displeased with his music. This cd is another great hit from the King himself but it is Michael Jackson so how could it not be great.
5,I love this Album,"This is a great album. I bought two, one for me and the other for a family member as a gift."
5,Dangerous MJ lives and emerges,"I just recently bought this CD and I have to say I was very impressed!Having listened to all his earlier works through the years it was easy to ""grow"" with him with these songs. Every one of them is excellent!!A must have for MJ collectors. As he emerged and grew from ""off the wall"" to ""Thriller"" he does so in Dangerous. ""Give in to me"" is very good, haunting!"
5,go michael!!,"dangerous is michael's most experimental CD he took musical risks with this CD touching on hip hop, instrumental, and even classical throughout the tracks on this CD and he co wrote and wrote all by himself for the songs here. This CD was definitely made when michael jackson was at his creative peak and I sure hope he tries to put out new music in the future cause he's still got it."
5,DANGEROUS!!!! THE GIRL IS SO DANGEROUS!!!!!,"This marked the highest point is his career. hit after hit! some of the best performances ive ever seen anyone do. seeing him perform dangerous in korea had me hooked as a michael jackson fan forever. forget the tabloids the press the news, whatever! this is what really counted! one of the greatest performers of all time in my opinion. dangerous was leaking hits when it hit the shelves. remember the time, jam, DANGEROUS. i capitalized that because its possibly his most creative performance ever both in song and on stage. almost every single song was a hit. a rarity these days, even for michael and his Invincible album."
2,Terrible when compared to his previous efforts.,"Michael Jackson's 4th solo album, ""Dangerous"" is probably his worst. There are very few catchy tunes to listen to. There are a few good ones, like: Jam, She Drives Me Wild, Do You Remember The Time, Black or White and Dangerous, but overall, the albums a ...."
5,Satisfied,"This is a good product. We bought it to work with a new Olympus camera. It does every thing it says it will do. Truly, what more can you ask?"
5,Very good knife,"I am very pleased with this knife. It certainly meats the manufacturers advertised claims for quality. I bought the knife out of curiosity and now find that the clean lines, integrity of the blade and familiar feel in my hand make it a choice for many tasks I would not have thought of, based upon its shape. I am indeed very pleased with this knife."
5,Great knife,"I like cold steel's products and this is one of their better ones, the blade is shaped perfect for a boot. It has a good edge and holds it well."
2,so so,"the blade is nice and thick and feels solid but has an unimpressive edge. The grip panels look and feel well made and solid, but with the shape and size the handle is a little hard to wrap my hand around. The knife is not sharp out of the box. It is brand new and I am looking to have it sharpened professionally just to make it respectable, which is going to add to the cost. This is definitely an el-cheapo knife, but it does seem solid. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great Sword for the price,"Very good sword, great balance to it,Sharp, blade is a little long for me, but I am a small person. Great practice sword, I use for kung fu and tai chi both."
3,Not helpful to me!!,"My boyfriend recently broke up with me and broke my heart in a second.I'm 27 years old and never felt like this before. I searched and bought many books trying to find a way to make me feel better and find answers to the tones of questions and ifs that were bothering my mind.This book didn't help me a lot. The writing feels distant and it is difficult to see the author as a friend or at least as someone close to you and your feelings.It can be useful only if you were married and now divorced but not if you had a relationship and lived separately.It has a lot of chapters concerning how to raise your children after a divorce or how to split the money and the invstments, things that can't concern people who had a serious relationship,who loved the other very much but who haven't been married or lived together for a long time.Also I found its advice old-fashioned and out of date."
1,warped and split apart,"Snow River Wood/Poly All Purpose BoardAs soon as I received the board I oiled it. The next day, I used it, washed it by hand, and set it aside. The following morning the wood had warped so badly that it had separated from the poly. I threw both pieces away."
5,The film's plot took me by surprise,"Some reviewers have likened Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond-like. This is nonsense and goes to show how easily an actor gets typecast, even if retroactively.Craig plays a history professor, specializing in the Stalin era, who is approached by a Russian former NKVD officer claiming to possess knowledge of Josef Stalin's secret diary. This is too tempting for him and he overstays his welcome in Russia. There is no James Bond acrobatics or superman actions, but the action is nonetheless very suspenseful as he attempts to unravel the trail to the truth, which takes him to the city of Archangel at the Arctic Circle. And the truth is much more bizarre than what he could have imagined it would be.The movie is set in Russia."
2,A so so flick.,Craig is a better James Bond. The movie is okay but predictable and I only purchased it because of Craig. Do not recommend it except as something when nothing else exists.
3,Have not finished,"This is good, but not quite a interesting as I had hoped. Got sidelined by othe reading materials and have not finished it, but I plan to."
1,soft claws not good for paws,Groomer had a hard time applying.They need to be removed for trimming since the nail continues to grow.Very upsetting to dog.
4,"Sturdy, attractive panniers","These panniers work well. They have good carrying capacity, are stable, and seem very well-built. I'm glad I bought them."
4,"Good, Fast read!",What a neat story. It was not the most professional I have read but certainly unique and entertaining. Prepare to swipe some tears.
4,To Dance with the White Dog,"This novel was a sweet story. I enjoyed that it was told from an older mans perspective because as baby boomers, so many are having to care for their aging parents. The novel is a light, quick read which fills the reader with hope, love and fun."
5,THOSE WHO LOVE WILL KNOW HOW PERFECT IT IS,"This is one of those rare, perfect books that will stay with you for the rest of your life. A bittersweet premise (the prospect of growing old and dying), the book is filled with hope and love and the promise of more to come. The characters (especially the main character and his wife) are unforgettably lovable and people who run the gamut of emotions. The plot never slows, and it speaks straight to the heart. This is a special book that can stand on its own with no special effects needed. Although I'd call it ""quiet,"" it packs an emotional wallop, but one you'll love. Anyone who's really loved will both laugh and cry when reading this book, and I can guarantee one thing--no one will ever forget it. Buy it, cherish it, give it to someone you DEARLY love. This is definitely an American classic and storytelling at its best. Sheer magic!"
2,Depressing and Preachy,"The illustrations are beautiful and the cause is noble, but unless you feel like explaining to your young child why people are shooting guns at poor pole dog, or why pole dog is eating garbage I would pass this one by. It may work for older children, but it's definitely rated PG."
1,Beware. Read carefully. Not real teak. Made of Rubberwood.,"FALSE ADVERTISING! There is no teak used in the construction of this stool. Read the product description ""All pieces made of rubber wood."" Rubber Wood comes from rubber tree plantations. It is not a very durable wood and will not hold up to moisture like teak."
3,Kind of drumming on the terror in France too much?,"This plot seems to take Baroness Orczy's hero past a pointof believable. I enjoyed the period plot,but having read much about this eraI thought the dress/ costumes in the movie a little cleanfor the terror era in France.The sense of desperation that ruled at this time seemed absentas well. People were turning their friends and relatives inand heads in the thousands were rolling.The male actor Richard E. Grant just isn't very convincingas the Pimpernel."
3,So So,"Nothing really wrong with it, but I didn't fall in love with it when I started playing it. It's fine, but not one I look forward to playing as much as others I own. It's not as warm as some bari ukes, but it does the job."
2,"The big,The bad,The SCORPONOK!","I'm always having too much attention with Scorponok,he's allways going to others'personal space and attacking them,especially Megatron and Optimus.He's always showi'n of his muscels and good looks which ticks off especially Megatron.That's why most people gang up on him.Scorponok transforms to a hover jet and mechanical scorpion.He also has bigg'ol claws and a stinger full of electricity and raw energon.He's in my main ofice on top of a summit pumping himself up sayi'n;""I'm the best of all you weaklings!AH HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!!!And Megatron shall pay for dissing my master Alpha Q!All he wanted was to have back his planet and this is what he gets!You people sicken me!""He drives every one crazy!We'lp,gotta get goin!"
5,Great CD!,"I'm Also 18 and about to graduate HS and this is still one of my favorite cds! I actually bought this cd about 3 years ago (a different cover-same cd) and LOVED IT! I didn't give ""Home"" a chance at first but one day I listened to it and it is probably one of my all time favorite songs! I love broadway and I sing and its a very challenging song to sing! Susan Egan has a gorgeous voice! And none more gorgeous than Jodi Benson (Ariel!). My point is this is a great cd, don't ignore it becuase you don't know all the songs...you'll grow to love them as much as the favorites!"
5,The Most Comforting Self-Help Book I Ever Read,"I have read Embracing Uncertainty by Dr. Susan Jeffers a couple of times and I find it the most comforting self-help book that I have ever read. Seldom is one provided with so many wonderful tools to overcome the stress and anxiety caused by the troubled world around us. Against the background of the current world crisis, a lousy economy and the constant threat of terrorist attacks, we all need help to keep calm and balanced, and I found Dr. Jeffers's advice to be ideal in terms of leveling my personal equilibrium. Now, I can approach each day with much more confidence and handle the uncertainty in the world without feeling fearful and stressed. Further, the book is filled with such common sense advice that's so clearly stated, it is accessible to everyone. I can't recommend this highly enough! A great gift for loved ones..."
2,Looking for something more positive,"No one knows what tomorrow may bring but I would rather look forward to something with excitement instead of a ""maybe this will happen or not"" attitude. I didn't really care for the mediocre attitude - shouldn't we strive / expect more. Sometimes there is disappointment but it's better than shrugging ones shoulders and saying ""oh well"". Shouldn't we have a more positive attitude. Yes, we need to be realistic about things. If someone has cancer or any other serious illness a positive attitude is much more helpful than ""maybe they will beat it, maybe they won't. Sorry but I find this attitude depressing. Perhaps this attitude is why so many of our younger generation does not strive for things, just does enough in school to get by or drops out of school."
3,Minimally Helpful Manual,"Writing a manual that covers so many model years must be a challenging endeavor. Reading one is also challenging. I found just about the minimal amount of information I needed in assisting me to change out the starter motor on my 2000 CRV. I got the job done, but can't say the manual helped all that much. In fact, it suggested some steps that were unnecessary that would have made the job much more difficult."
3,Don't look for a live concert!,"This is a nice JB documentary for true fans, but if you are looking for a concert performance (like I was), you will NOT find it here!"
2,Not very strong line,"I have a rather small yard and it takes me about 10 minutes to do my weed whacking. My TORO weed whacker uses two 10"" segements of line in the spool. This line cannot even make it thru those 10 minutes without having to be replaced. It is the softest, least durable line I have ever used and now I am stuck with a huge roll of it. What is even more flummoxing is the fact that this line at .105 is a thicker than .080 line I have used in the past yet still is less durable. How can that be?? I will try a different brand next time."
2,Leather changes color,"The bag is very nice and the structure is great. However, the leather is so soft that it ha hanged color. The bag I bought for by boyfriend is now brown and black."
3,heavy bag,This brief case looks good and the leather is durable. There are lots of pockets and compartments and that's good....But:It is incredibly heavy with absolutely nothing in it and the latch broke almost immediately (doesn't stay entirely closed).None-the-less; I always get comments when I take it to work. Everyone asks if I got a new bag even though I've had it for years.
1,Completely illegible text,"This is a scan of an older book (actually more of a pamphlet). The scan is so bad that entire pages are just smudged pixels. I understand that some of these scanned books have illegible words here and there, but this one is totally useless. If anyone in the production process had simply picked it up and opened it to ANY page it would be obvious that in its present condition this printing is in no condition to sell or ship."
2,Not as good as others here suggest,"The Maverick guide to Bermuda didn't meet the high expectations set by other reviews here.There isn't a whole lot to the book, it isn't full of secret suggestions as others suggested. Instead there is much on the obvious basics and little beyond.Our family did enjoy the chapter discussing some of the colorful history of Bermuda, but otherwise I regret the purchase. I suspect one of the other guidebooks would have been a better choice.I do recommend Bermuda!"
4,Originally on the Mercury Label?,"I seem to recall seeing these records in my college library and I think they were on the Mercury label. I later bought the Everest recordings, and now I have this cd set. Krips has an interesting take on Beethoven, but there are times when the brass could come out a little more. These are very moving interpretations. Well...except when he whistles along with the choir in the last movement of the Ninth Symphony, then you're more like ""What the hell was that?"" These are a bargain, and pretty good for stereo's early days."
3,Good but very limited,"This is a good beginner sourcebook if you are interested in the New England area of what would become the United States. Good bibliography and good overview in text. But since it covers more than 200 years, and tries to cover European settlement life in the whole of the future USA it must fall short, so don't use it as your only source. It does not cover any part of what would later become Canada, and since both nations were part of British/French ""Colonial America"" it falls short there too. So, buy it for the bibliography."
3,poor writing,"This book is useful in that it provides a lot of information not found elsewhere, but the writing is poor. Many times I had to stop myself and re-read a sentence."
2,Re: Loud and Broken,"I used this for shredding paper about once per week for 3 years before it quit in the middle of shredding paper. I picked out all the paper parts and turned it back on. The gears will run until paper is inserted and then stop.When it was working, it was VERY loud. I would not recommend this shredder."
1,If you have dark hair do not waste your money,I bought this for my son who has short dark brown hair and used 3/4 of a bottle and let it sit for half an hour and honestly can't tell the difference once it was rinsed out. I knew it wouldn't be as obvious on dark hair but we did expect to see some change.
1,Don't bother!,Take your child to a professional swim instructor. I have taught for over 15 years and this is by far the worst video I have seen. I wanted new ideas for my instructors. I found my 15 year old instructors are better than the video. Don't bother.
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I have just finished reading the book ""Including Alice"" by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. It is about a young girl named ""Alice"" who goes through a lot of changes in her life. Her father gets remarried after her mother dies and her brother moves out of the house. She also goes through all of the typical teenage experiences such as, getting braces and breaking up with her boyfriend.I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to put down because it was so interesting. Elliana posted a review on amazon.com that said that ""once you start reading this book you can't stop!""Another reason why I liked this book so much was because I could really relate to it. Alice is in high school and so am I. I highly recommend this book to any teenager who is looking for a good book to read that they can enjoy."
2,Very disappointed,"My Britta arrived two days ago, and I still can't get it to make anything. I have followed directions precisely, and all it does is sputter steam and hot water at the joint. Not a drop makes it into the top part. And yes, I have been very careful to avoid grounds at the seal. Will try to send this POS back. BTW, even if this gadget did work properly, I would not be impressed. It looks like it was made in China. As others have noted, the edges are sharp, and the metalic surfacing looks like it will start chipping off quickly. This in no way can be appliance-grade stainless steel.aUpdate...have tried to make espresso 5 times. Same technique every time. Three times it produced no espresso, two times it worked. Must be a faulty pressure valve. Also foumd out it was made in Romania, not Italy."
2,Not to hot sock,"This sock is made of really thick, ugly, itchy, material. Not comfortable at all. Makes your calf look 10x bigger than it actually is.I would not recommend this sock to anyone."
1,Don't Buy it - minus 5 stars,After turning the game on you have to push the A key a couple of 100 times to get through some story background - I don't care I want to play the game. After going back and forward and up and down a few elevators and into some rooms where people wanted money - of which I had none and didn't know how to get - despite the story I gave up and played a different game.I will not buy another Mario game.
4,awesome,this is one of my favorite games of all time. this is the third instalment in the paper mario franchise and i love it. the game takes on a different style than the previous two games. it's different but it is a very great game and i recomend it to anybody who owns a wii.
4,Great Fun for the Wii,"I am a Sony Xbox guy, so the way i see it, the two power houses systems are better then the Wii. But Paper Mario is one of the very few Wii games that is actually fun and can be in the big times. The game is easy enough for kids, and fun enough for adults. A side from a actually story line, its your basic mario with a few Wii style twists.The game is fun for all ages and a must have for the Wii. Do go buy it, and enjoy."
4,I love this game my friend hates it,I love this game because it makes you think on what to do next. My friend hates it because she just wants to play & not have to stop & read every 2 minutes.
3,Not That Good,"Before you even start to play the game, you have to wade through about 30 minutes of character dialog, which is really annoying. There's no way to skip through it. Then, once you do get to play, it's not very interesting or difficult. You just basically walk around visiting characters and listen to what they have to say. Personally, I'd rather be playing more."
1,Don't Buy It!,"To me this game is not worth $[...] let alone $[...]. The beginning of the game takes about 15 minutes just to tell you a story then you're stuck in the first ""world"" forever. I guess this game is good for those who have a ton of time on their hands, it's not for the casual gamer. I thought it would be more like the old school Mario and I was definitely disappointed!"
1,Nintendo - What were you thinking????,"Wow, I cannot put into words just how bad this game SUCKED.It was fun for the first 20 min or so, but after that it became VERY boring. The amount of reading (instead of actual playing) that you do for this game is INCREDIBLE!The controls were clunky, the graphics were terrible, and the 3d was awful.In plain words, do not buy this game.I know when you hear the name Mario - you automatically think fun. Well forget that when you think about this game. There are plenty more Mario games out there, that are MUCH more fun than this complete waste of time.This game is just awful, plain and simple. Furthermore, my 6 yr old (that can read way above his age level) got very frustrated with the amount of reading that had to be done for this game. I can't say I blame him at all.It can take 1-2 hrs to finish a level. That is just not fun period.Buy another game!!!"
1,BORING- STUPID - RIDICULOUS GRAPHICS,"Save your moneyHorrible graphics, 20 min to even start to play with all the talking. Its not even talking but the characters talking in those bubbles and you reading and clicking A to continue... it goes on forever and on every level. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
2,The game that won't shut up,"The cut scenes for this game last for...eve...er. Seriously, blab blab blab. And, it's not a complicated story to explain. If what you enjoy is playing a game, don't buy this one. You spend half your time reading mediocre blather. Also, it's obvious that they didn't make the game with the Wii in mind. When you play the game, you turn the controller horizontally, and use it like you would any other older Nintendo controller. This is pointless as a Wii game, and kind of stupid and slow as any kind of game."
2,Huge let down,"I absolutely LOVED the first two paper mario games. The gamecube and n64 versions were fantastic, I could play them over and over again, and I do. But this wii version is atrocious. It pains me that it even holds the paper mario name. I've tried and tried to give the game a fair chance and to get into it, but I just cannot. I dislike the style of play. The whole point of paper mario was that he was 2d in a 3d world. I understand the ""flipping"" concept in this game but it's just well.. bad. Not enjoyable by any stretch. I feel like I'm playing super mario brothers and that's not the feeling I want to have when I'm playing a paper mario game. If you have not tried the first two paper mario games I'm sure you'd really enjoy this game, but coming from that background this game is a huge let down."
3,Disappointing and Slow,"I enjoyed the first two paper mario games very much as a role playing game. This one is completely different and tries...I said tries...to be an updated version of Super Mario Brothers with role playing aspects. It doesn't feel anything like the first two games in the series. The story and dialog are slow and boring. The puzzles are decent and some clever. The 2D/3D switching is interesting to an extent. It had some entertainment value (therefore the 3 star rating), but I wish I had rented it rather than gotten my own copy. I would not recommend this title if you are expecting a Paper Mario type game for the Wii. If you haven't played those two games, you are more likely to enjoy this as long as slow story/dialog don't bother you."
3,"Mario's english, not so good","I know I'll get death threats for this, and possibly a visit from a Donkey Kong hitman, but I thought this game was only so-so. It has the typical cheesy, shallow story line, which I'd be fine with, except for inconsistencies and an apparently poor translation at times. The level designs are fun, and the flip in dimensions is innovative and useful. Making the game play for the most part quite fun.My one major complaint is switching the pixels. As much fun as some of the powers are, the play mechanics to switch between them will suck you right out of the game. To have to frequently jump into the menu system make a couple selections and switch your pixel is a real drag. I'm perplexed that they didn't treat them like swapping out guns in a FPS, which would have made much more sense, especially considering how essential they are for normal game play.Otherwise, I believe I would have found enjoyment through the entire game, instead of"
1,Disappointed Buyer!,"When buying this book first scout the competition. Other Medical School guides could be more up to date than this one. FOr example, John Hopkins now requires the MCAT for 2002 admission. This policy has been known if you were to call the school (I did in June/2000). However, in this book it claims that the MCAT is not needed. Furthermore, this is the 2001 edition. Yet it uses the averages for 1998 (page 5) rather than 1999. Yes, some of the information was useful, but most of it a perosn could call the school and get just as easily and for free!"
2,Quality of the Video was poor,"While I like this movie, I did not like the quality. I would not have purchased it if I knew of the poor quality. It was barely watchable."
1,Awful,"This movie is horrible and the furthest thing i've seen from reality. The acting, plot, and filming was cheap and uninteresting. Save your money."
2,Everywhere And Nowhere,"This movie could have been much better had it decided to only go in one or two directions, but instead, it went in fifteen different directions , introducing us to fifteen different potential stories, exploring only three slightly more than the others. The lessons on prejudiced and revenge were too ostentacious, instead of carefully woven into the stories. There were so many things going on,with so many people, that the movie bordered on boring. The characters were well defined, they just were not used properly.All in all, it did not cross the line into boredom, but it definately opened the door. With everything going on, the movie went no where, because it tried too hard to go everywhere. Don't think I will be reaching for this one on a rainy night."
3,A bit of a letdown...,"This is an uneven and oddly structured biography of Mahatma Gandhi. The author is well-versed in Gandhi's letters, books and speeches, from which he quotes at length to tell the story of Gandhi's amazing personal life and political career. He is less successful, however, at painting in the background information needed to make sense of all the details. Readers unfamiliar with Hinduism, untouchability, Hindu/Muslim communal relations, Congress Party politics, or Britain's imperial system would have a hard time making sense of the narrative. For specialists only."
5,5 stars because my dog loves it and I don't have any problems with it,"The installation is kind of confusing at first. The instruction manual is not that detailed, but it doesn't take too long to figure out how to set it up. I have a 5lb chihuahua. She was scared at first, but now she loves it. We actually put a tiny pillow inside so it's more comfortable to lie down in there (It is kind of deep. I guess this is no problem if you have a bigger dog). The leash in the back that keeps your dog from jumping seems fine to me. Just buy a collar that doesn't go around the neck (buy the ones that go around the legs and neck). This will prevent your puppy from choking if s/he tries to jump out. The length is adjustable. Hope this review helps! Always put on a collar for your dog before using the booster seat! If you don't, it will defeat the purpose of buying one."
5,One of the best ever!,"If you are a Journey fan, this is the CD/download you should buy. It has everything you could possibly want in their music and then some. I highly recommend The Essential Journey."
3,Vol 5: Pure Genius ... vol 6? Eh...,"I don't know anything about the background of this book nor anything about the author's other projects as the other reviewers. I'm just judging this at face value based on my own entertainment value. Personally, this one lost me. Maybe my impressions of this volume will change after reading 7 and 8 (the latest volume available at the time of this review.) Volume 5 hit a crescendo ... and I somewhat enjoyed the first half of this book. But then the story telling and the artwork got sloppy. I'm still not sure what's going on, quite honestly ... and then the last few pages were unfinished? What the heck is that? Still, I think that the series (?) as a whole is the best that I've read since I started buying these ""graphic novels""."
1,Sorry songs in a sorry package,Reba keeps perpetuating the myth that her music is country. Her music is NOT country but pop mish/mash. This compilation is a good representation of pop music but is not country music by any standards. Not at all.
1,ONE STAR IS BEING TOO KIND,"This has just got to be the absolute worst greatest hits collection I've ever heard in my life. There are much better songs on her albums that were never released as singles that would classify under the title ""hits"" instead of the pop fluff that we are relegated to in this overrated fiasco!"
1,REBAS WORST MATERIAL COMPILED INTO ONE PACKAGE,"In the late 1980s Reba all but forsook and abandoned the music that she was born to sing and that made her famous to go pop on us, no doubt at the insistence of her record company under duplicitous executive Jimmy Bowen who sees with dollar signs and forgets about the artist's musical integrity. Such is the case here as this contains songs from the mid nineties to the present which are so overproduced and filled with pop influences which the traditional lover of country music will be hard to stomach!! I can't stand listening to this type of tripe anymore!!"
1,Nothing Special,"These are just more pop songs. I did like ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" but you can have the rest."
1,ALL HER CROSSOVER ATTEMPTS,"Songs like ""Take It Back"" and ""Why Haven't I Heard from You"" along with rock ditties like ""One HOnest Heart"" and ""I'm a Survivor""......taint country folks...just all of Reba's attempts to crossover. She should realize she has arrived and doesn't have to do this kind of stuff anymore."
1,I WOULDN'T GET THIS ONE UNLESS...,You love crossover stuff. That's all Reba seems to care about doing and none of these songs are noteworthy or deserve to be called hits. There are other songs on her CDs that were not released as singles that could qualify for hit material better than what is represented here.
1,SALTY PRODUCTION!,A lot of these reviews have commented on the fact that Miss McEntire's music is way overdone. I agree. But that's what she likes and who are we to tell her not to put extra salt in her food if she wants it?? I don't like salty food myself so I'll bypass this CD because its extremely loaded with salt!
5,EXCELLANT!!!,This is one of the most spiritually helpful books that I have read in a long time. This would be excellant for anyone struggling with why does God allow things to happen. What an uplifting book. Please advise if anyone has found the other 3 books in the series. I want very much to continue the story.
5,"The ""Rest of the Story"" Needs to be Told","Ever since first reading this book in 1996 I've periodically looked for the rest of this series. The unique vision of Mark Littleton in giving us a glimpse of heaven before the world was made stirs the heart with possibilties. Seeing the world through the eyes of angels was very creative and insightful.While I wouldn't go so far as saying this fictional book is Biblical, it definitely stirs one to look at the stories of the Bible in a new light. I was particularily impressed with the manner in which Mark casted a vision of worship from the point of view of an angel. It gave me much to think about in regards to my own life.The book was a quick and rewarding read (it ends just when things really start to get interesting). I look forward seeing how the ""rest of the story"" goes and finding myself transported once again into rhelms unseen by human eyes.This series is definately an undiscovered pearl."
2,The little engine,"This is a cooling pad that looks nice and seems to work well, but sounds like a truck. There were some thoughtful features, but the fans made far too much noise. I returned it and bought the logitech unit"
5,I love it!!!,"I love my new Zalman ZM NC1000 Notebook Cooler. It is well made, very cool looking, quiet and keeps my Mac Pro cooler. Highly recommended."
3,coffee table,This is a very nice coffe table book. It is fine for someone who wants to play with maple syrup. I was discouraged because Iam going to run a large opperation.
4,Too Much Cutting!,"The felt figures are large and beautiful, but they take forever to cut out. You need a very sharp pair of scissors and a good hour or two."
5,"Harwichport to P-Town, Linclon is Cape Cod at its best!","Not many people ever have a chance to read Joseph C. Lincoln's books. They are extremely hard to find, because most went out of print in the early 1900's. However when you do find an antique copy, it is a real treasure. His stories echo back to a time of whaling, fishing, snowy Cape Cod Christmas', friends, warm summer days on the beach, sailing, and working the cranberry bogs. It is quintessential Americana, with a twist of adventure, drama, and sometimes mystery wrapped up in a flavorful, Jimmy Buffet-esque atmosphere of life on old Cape Cod."
5,Table is great.,Received the table with no damage. It was a bit tricky at first to put together with only one person. But I did get the table together in minutes after that and it looks great.
3,Retro Table and chairs,"Chairs are nice, easy enough to put together. Table is very wobbly. I guess thats the way it will be with that center leg. Looks good, works for a kitchen table."
2,See the movie instead.,"This is a self-important chicken-little thriller about a pending biological apocalypse, and is based on the movie with the same title (starring: Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo and Morgan Freeman). The book centers around Motaba, the ""deadliest virus that science has ever encountered."" It reaches the U.S. thanks to a money, which escapes captivity. It is a adventure where the hero has to work to find a cure to highly virulent virus, find the money and create an antiserum, in spite of the efforts of an evil brigadier general."
3,Could be better,good album some good rangers songs on here BUT it's not the greatest still looking for a better collection has to many half rangers songs on and bad recordings of some rangers classics.
5,Killer Advice,"Don't start it unless you know how it ends and don't try to end it without watching this. Brisk, entertaining and illuminating."
4,"You don't have ""it all"" until you have this","Explosive gospel (even though songs repeat). Paul Foster(later with Soul Stirrers, remember his call & responsewith Sam Cooke?) sings great lead with Golden Echoesand the Detroiters' Little Ax Broadnax (originallyfrom Spirit of Memphis) soars and cries with hismatchless tenor. These groups may not be as famous assome other gospel groups of the post-war era, buttheir credentials are right on top. Great material, greatvoices, only caveat is that songs repeat on this CDand once it appears somebody forgot their lyrics onsong ""Old Time Religion"", but still worth buying.A nice combination of sweet and ""hard"" gospel sound- inspiring."
1,Bad Science,"This book is to be avoided for two reasons. First, the author applies no valid scientific principles before drawing conclusions about cat behavior based on his observations of a few pets and, apparently, legends about the creatures. For example, he simply repeats the old idea that domestic housecats are solitary by nature, whereas serious biologists have lately concluded that these animals have a social structure similar to that of lions (e.g., female cats live together and raise one another's offspring). Second, and most alarming, the author is a threat to the environment, and his opinions should not be spread. He moved to New Zealand, acquired five cats, and has no remorse about letting them run free in a rain forest, where they frequently grab rare birds that have no experience fleeing predators. The author maintains that keeping cats indoors is cruel. But is it any less cruel to cause the suffering, death, and possible extinction of some birds? Please do NOT buy this book!"
4,An enjoyable quick read for the cat lover,"If you are picking up this book, you are bound to be a cat lover, just like Jerffey Moussaieff Masson. He writes with a heart felt style when discussing the emotions that cats have. He has written many books about animals, and seems to have great insight as to what goes on inside their brains and hearts.You can quickly tell he is an avid cat lover, as he has many cats himself. Through years of observations of animals and through his own experiences he sums cats emotions into nine categories: narcissism, love, contentment, attachment, jealousy, fear, anger, curiosity, and playfulness. These nine emotions seem to work well in explaining why cats are they way they are.The book does not offer a bunch of scientific explanation behind his theories, but offers his hypothesis from his personal experience. A cat lover will enjoy his tales and stories, as some are quite entertaining. After reading this book you will certainly look at your cat through different eyes."
1,This book stinks like kitty litter,"As a cat lover, with 12 indoor only cats I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I ended up irate that this man thinks he knows cats well enough to write about them. He seems to have only lived with them a year and even gave one of his five away at one point. When I take an animal in, it us mine for the lifetime of the animal regardless of behavior or any other problem. I also believe as most intelligent people do that cats should be kept indoors only. Yes, they may get a little bored, but it is the owner's job to find new ways to stimulate them. A beach in New Zealand may be fairly safe for cats, but you never know when they could get into poison or near an animal abuser. If you want to know about the emotional lives of cats just watch and enjoy them."
5,Excellant!!!!!,This book is excellant one of the best i have ever read. If you like mystery and suspense your sure to love this book !!!!!!!!!!
5,another good one,"i really enjoyed this book. all of the books by this author that i have read have been great! good suspense, i didnt guess who did it until the end. if youre a fan, this book is worth adding to the collection."
3,Interesting dance with murder.,I picked up this book when I was in the mood for a mystery. I hadn’t read a Mary Higgins Clark book in years. I found the story entertaining with likable characters that are clearly defined. As usual there is a predictable twist. I would give this book 3.5 stars.
2,I'm being generous with the two stars,"This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing and elementary at best. Icouldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. Ew yuck, don't bother. And I'm actually a fan of MHC. END"
5,A Non-stop thriller,"Loves Music, Loves to Dance was awesome. I mean I could not put it down. The interesting thing is that I usually dont like reading books or I never seem find any that interest me but this one is great. I read it in like two days and i would have finished it earlier i just had school. This is one of those cool who-done-it books and i had no idea who the killer was until the very end. Seriously, though i recommend this book for any one that doesn't really get involved with books because by the time your done with this one you be reading all of Mary Higgins Clark. So check it out and see what you think of this Suspense"
3,"A sometimes fun, mostly boring, predictable journey.","Mary delivers a predicatable novel, filled with slow paced action and a very obvious who-dunnit approach ... While still keeping true to her traditional style, ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" is different from the other books. I have found some of Clark's books to be melodramatic and even boring, however this novel here is somewhat readable and will keep you flipping pages, if not a little grudgingly.After reading several chapters, it became clear as to who the 'bad guy' was, and a lot of the time her writing was methodical and predictable. Not a new book, by any means, but satisfyingly light and fluffy.A good book to read to bed, or in the car."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!,LO PEOR DE LA MUSICA!UNA BASURA!! LA VERGUENZA DE LA MUSICA LATINA Y DE LOS MEXICANOS.NO COMPREN EL DISCO...ES HORIBLE!
1,jesus christ!!this ho has no vocal talent whatsoever!!!!!,"this girl has no talent whatsoever her fans are pretty pathetic for buying her albums,she sells albums because these producers are being paid a lot of money to help her cause admit it this woman cant sing to save her life! alejandra guzman sings better, paulina rubio sounds like she swallowed razors, that goes to show that people buy any crap thats in front of them"
5,"Brighter, Bigger and Better!!!",Excellent Excellent Paulina is back big style what can i say she rocks rocks rocks !
5,No es lo MIsmo con stress que con PAU LATINA,"to begin with, i dont know why people rate this album with one star, and then they say that thalia is better. Thats so obvious that they're thalias' fans, Have a mind of ur Own, if u dont like it because of what it is, ITS OK but dont come and bash it just becus u are a thalia fan. thats so childish and stupid.anyway, i really like this album, the songs are full of rythm,like MY FRIEND, MY AMIGO i thinks its one of the best songs, but my fav. of them all its OJALA and MIA .in MIA You could apreciate her bulk talent. also ALGO TIENES unplugged, sounds reeally cool."
3,¿Y ESTO QUE ES?,"Disco raro de Paulina que poco a poco se fue alejando de sus primeros cds qeu esos si eran buenos...Es como todo, se dejo arrastrar por tratar de vender en forma internacional y perdio identidad. Una lastima."
4,Do your due dilligence first,"I wanted to rebuke the guy who said that Paulina was a fraud and that her voice is ""autotuned manually"". I just saw her at a concert in Las Vegas and the girl can sing and put on a show only few people can. The place was rocking on every song - full of energy and no whiners who can't be happy with the success of others."
3,Totallt diferent... and weird style,"This a good one; Paulina ofered a new style for all the latin fans, but weird style, so weird, sometimes... when you listen to this record, you can compare the music style to Lorna's music or the summer hit of 2001 ""La Bomba"". This a good album, with rich latin rythms. But it's not the style for this latin dance diva. Better than Border Girl, that doesn't made her best on France, perhaps... because it was a translation from ""Paulina"" record one, with some new inedit singles. Paulatina best are: Te quise tanto, Ojala, Mia, Adiosito Corazon, Dame otro Tequila... and Perros is good to dance... but in lyrics so poor. The song written by Paulina do not offer talent from her to write songs."
1,Una basura!!!!!,"Oh my god!! Que hace esa mujer en la musica todavia??!?! La pobre no puede cantar, no tiene voz, hasta mi perro es mejor que ella! Es lamentable que algo así (una porquería) sea numero uno en Billboard...!"
1,This is Kids music!!!! Lyrics are for little kids!!!!!,"When I heard the entire Cd on www.univision.com I was surprised. I thought this was going to be an amazing Cd, but I was wrong. The lyrics are childish. For ex. on the first track, she sings: Algo tienes, pau pau pau, and she repeats her name. Come on, we already know you Pau. It seems as if she was boxing. Then the fast songs sound as Regional Mexican music instead of the so-called latin sounds. If you dont believe me, listen to My friend, mi amigo. The Cd is not worth buying it. I recommend you Laura Pausini, Shakira, or even Natalia Lafourcade instead of this. In the stores, the Cd is not been sold at all. PAULINA released in the year 2002 was better. I strongly suggest you spend your money wisely. Otherwise, you will be upset!!!"
2,Not worth buying,The games in this book are not anything that a normal adult couldn't think of on their own or find at any play place. Peak a boo...
2,Slick but not very useful,"I saw this book at a friend's house and was very impressed by its slick production and the blurb on the back. I bought the book but was very disappointed. Most of the ideas, like ""hide and seek"" for example, are obvious and will be arrived at by most parents on their own."
5,A very fun book for all ages,"Patricia C. Wrede has always been one of my favorite authors, and her newest book does not dissapoint. The Frying Pan of Doom is hilarious"
3,Some are good some are bad; best part is at the end!,"The book has many stories, and some are really good, others are lame. For me the best part of the book was at the end, when the author explains where she had the ideas for each story."
5,A wonderful collection of stories!,"10 different stores in the real world or in the Enchanted Forest(or somewhere near there)all with magic or wonderful beings(some not so wonderful, others very). My favorite was Utensile Strength; I still havn't goten enough of Cimorene, Mendanbar, and Daystar and I'd love it if Ms Wrede would write more of their adventures!!"
2,Not how I pictured.,"These glasses were packaged very well. I don't like the glasses. They look better in the picture. They are not as blue as seen in the picture. One glass has one thick line of blue,that's it. Too much trouble to send them back ."
5,GREAT Quality!,Plan to buy more of these! They are heavy and look WONDERFUL with my cobalt (Fiesta) dishes! They are much better quality than I had thought when I purchased them. I DO wish they made THREE sizes though... but I can do with two ;)
5,Wow,"These glasses are definately handmade. They have a great weight and feel. They are like individual works of art. Very fast shipping, will buy again!"
5,Great Innovation,"Great clean fun for all ages. This game is very interesting, always entertaining and fun to play. It's a throwback to simple games of NES. A great play."
5,Dreamy!,"Leaves my skin clean and soft. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the scent! I have allergies and am unable to use almost all scents. This one is wonderful, clean, soft and no allergy problems."
5,Grace shower cream,This is a wonderful product. It is as good as its name implies - Grace. The fragrence is light and it makes my skin feel wonderful. Worth every penny! Great product.
5,"This book will change your life! Read it, then live it.","After studying Buddhism in many forms over the past few years this book and David's point of view has crystalized my daily practice to produce the effects that Buddha was seeking..! Pain is part of life, your reaction to that pain is your decision. Decide to be happy. Forge a path to your own enlightenment. It's that easy, and that difficult. This book with show you how. Many thanks to David."
1,WHERE IS THE REAL DAVE ?,"MY SON LOVES THE ""THERE GOES"" SERIES,BUT ALL HE KEPT ASKING ME DURING THE ENTIRE VIDEO IS,WHERE'S DAVE,MOMMY.I MUST AGREE THE ORGINAL DAVE IS MUCH BETTER. WE HAVE ONLY WATCHED THIS VIDEO ONCE BECAUSE MY SON ONLY WANTS TO SEE ""THE REAL DAVE"". PURCHASE THERE GOES A BULLDOZER INSTEAD,ESPECIALLY IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALREADY FANS OF DAVE AND BECKY.IT'S OBVIOUS THE PARENTS CHOICE AWARDS NEVER WATCHED THE VIDEO WITH A CHILD WHO IS A FAN OF THE ORGINAL DAVE."
1,Yuck!,"This is some nasty soup. The noodles are fine. The soup is just bitter and nasty. Actually, there is no flavor just sort of a nasty bitter aftertaste. I'm kind of horrified. Even for a ""healthy"" soup, it's incredibly nasty. I expected it to be kind of boring and bland because it's got less sodium but it's really gross. I don't recommend this at all to anybody ever."
1,Ramen???,I expected an oriental flavored ramen soup. This is not it. I think it is awful and hate that I bought it in bulk.
1,Caught on fire in microwave,"I'm not sure what happened, but the bottom of the cup started to catch on fire when I was cooking it. I followed the instructions exactly. The bottom was black and smoking when I took it out. I didn't get to eat it, so I have no idea if it tasted good."
4,Good Addition,"I will definitely use this again. I had such a difficult time finding it in my local grocery store, so I ordered it. I used it for a marinade and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour. Worked very well."
5,best cd i have bought in a long time,"I don't usaully buy lyles music although i have always liked his music on the radio, the only other lovett album i own is I love Everybody and i dont like that one very much. So i reluctantly decided to buy this cd (...). It was well whorth the (money) i have listened to it 5 times since wendesday when I bouht it. If you don't really like lyle that much give this cd a try it's great, the only song I really did'nt care for was If I had a Boat. The Truck Song and Sana ntonio Girl are great. The cowboy song and give back my heart are other favorites., I may have to go buy some older Lyle music because am wearing this cd out. Also it has the lyrics and some nice photographs in the booklet.Give it a try you may really like it like i did."
3,Leaves out more than it includes !!!,"This covers lyle's 1st cd pretty well - only 'The Wedding Song'missing. My real gripe is with the tracks selected from 'Pontiac' & 'The Large Band'.Pontiac - where's She's No Lady, M-O-N-E-Y, Black & Blue, & She's Hot To Go ???????The Large Band - the 2 weakest tracks have been chosen !!!every other track would've been an improvement.Where's- I Married Her, Here I Am, Good Intentions, Cryin' Shame'What Do You Do/The Glory Of Love, Nobody Knows Me, Once Is Enough & Stand BY Your Man. My advice - forget this compilation& buy the 1st 3 lyle lovett cds instead - i have.I would rate 'Live In Texas' as a better compilation of Lyle'swork - Buy that as well plus don't over look ' The Road To Ensenada' - a fine effort."
4,Mini DV Camera Bag,"its so easy to use and fits all the parts and camera accessories. not the original sony bag though, but its just as good.very good choice."
4,This book I bought for class,"The book arrived on time and was in good condition. I trust this seller and would buy from him again.As far as the content of the book, it is terrible. The author is in love with himself and goes on and on about how fabulous he is. Do your self a favor and skip this read."
3,How Come?,"Man, i was a fan of So So Def when it came to Da Brat. Right now, her and Young Capone are the only ones that seem lyrikal to me. Young Capone, he seems like the Lloyd Banks of So So. Evem though i don't like G-Unit, Lloyd Banks is the best there. But back to this, Da brat is really the only one that can stand up in the rap world and be recognized as a tru rapper/emcee. Brat, keep doin what u doin, Capone, switch to Black Wall Street if you wanna be liked."
2,Just Ok at best,"past So-SO Def Projects have been interesting but this one is kinda flat throughout.I ain't that Big on Jermaine Dupri though I Respect His Hustle,but this time He just seems to be going through the Motions.He has had better Compilations than this one.this is just average at best."
4,Release tabs can be difficult when rear-facing otherwise great carseat,"I have to start by saying I LOVE this carseat. My husband and I looked long and hard for a convertable carseat and found this one to be the best for us. We love the material it is made of and found it easy to wipe clean. We did have to use a ""noodle"" to get it to recline more when rear-facing. That said I only have one complaint:1. The release tabs are hard to push down to get the seat belt to loosen. I tried it out prior to installing in my Toyota (SUV) and did not find it difficult; however, once installed rear-facing the tabs are against the seat and I have to press down on both tabs then use one hand to loosen the belts while still holding one tab down. I don't think this will be a problem once my son turns a year old and we can turn it around.Install was easy with the LATCH system and my son looks so comfortable."
1,very bad,"Very bad product. Don't buy it. I am having major problems staying connected with this product. I find my notebook pc starts roaming on other people's networks. According to the Intel site this free roaming ""...is designed to increase the efficiency of the wireless LAN by minimizing unnecessary data traffic."" It's also supposed to conserve battery life."
5,Yummy!,"I love this soup! I keep it in my trunk, in my desk at work, and in my cabinet at home. Anytime I don't feel like cooking I just pop one in the microwave. It's good food. As long as you follow the directions, make sure the water is hot enough if using a weak microwave, and make sure to let it sit as long as the directions say, it's hard to screw it up. My picky nephew will eat one of these before he'll eat most snack foods too."
2,First Miso soup,This was my first Miso soup and I wasnt very impressed. The flavor is so light that it's almost like eating unflavored noodles.
4,Chopin' Preludes Survey,"Claudio Arrau is a pianist with a very unique intellect and persona. His interpretation of the Preludes Op 28 (1973 Recording) is certainly in character. Arrau thought of the 24 preludes as one work displaying alternate visions of light and shade. For the most part I think this recording is very satsifying.To provide some perspective, I have been listening to the preludes for 50 years. I have rated some 37 pianists based upon approach, fidelity to the score, interpretation, technique, and overall artistry. The scores were very, very close. The top 6 were Pollini, Seta Tanyel, Lugansky, Argerich, Davidovich, and Juana Zayas. Only eye lashes separating them. Arrau and Ashkenazy finished in the top ten. But, Rubinstein , who normally renders such graceful and elegant performances seemed to be a bit crass in his 1946 recording."
2,I like my thrillers a little more believeable!,"The premise was good and could have made for a good story line. But come on, please.... am I really supposed to believe that Ben and Danielle can conduct all of these super human exploits with hardly a scratch? They seem to pop up everywhere, just in time to save the day, while everyone else gets picked off like fleas! Their wounds seem to heal supernaturally!And then I'm supposed to believe that a pot head who's stupid enough to believe that he's going to get all A's for the semester because he's helping the government, can crack the computer code that none of the big boys can? Nah...I like my protagonists a little more human, capable of mistakes, and more believeable and thereby likeable.I don't think I'll be reading any more of Land's books for a while. This one supposedly took place over a 12 day period and that was about 11 days too long for me."
1,Everything but the kitchen sink - unfortunately.,"It never ceases to amaze me how these books get published. The narrative is pedestrian and the plot implausible. Now don't get me wrong - I'm not looking for high lit here but come on - ""Sweat glistened in small beads atop her skin""!!!My advice for anyone looking for a good read in this genre - reread Frederick Forsyth. For that matter, Clive Cussler is better than this nonsense. And don't get me started on Dan Brown."
2,Don't be fooled!!,"When researching products that were safe to use for my baby, I came to find that the run around on the ingredient lists that ""natural"" products use is a load of crap. This product contains sodium laurel sulfate!! The ingredient label is as follows ""Plant based soap, plant based ono-ionic and anionic surfactants, water, citric acid, citrate, biodegradable preservative, biodegradable polymer, plant based fragrance."" So I called the company and asked them if this ingredient was used in the laundry detergent. Unless you do further research on products, they will fool you. This was very upsetting to me because I've been using ecover products for 4 years."
2,Can't tell ya!,Did no receive the small dog one. I receive the large dog 21-55lbs instead. If they would make sure to send what I ordered since my dog is only13 lbs. I might have used it. Hassles.
2,Disapointed,"To be honest,im very disapointed in this product,it did get rid of a few fleas but we are still having to pick fleas off her every day,ive used this product in the past with very good results,an she is a inside dog,so I dont know if I got a bad batch or what happened but it didnt work very well for us an I got for 21-55 lb dog an she weights only 22 lbs,so she should have been covered very well,probably will just buy from the vet office from now on"
5,Really works!,My dog's groomer recommended Advantage for the treatment of fleas. I find it works the best!
5,Flea's,"Price was right, delivery was on time and their was no damage.Absolutly no issues with this vendor and would use them again."
2,Didn't do the job,I've used Advantage before and had good luck with it but this batch didn't seem to work. I've heard there are counterfeits of this product out there and I wonder if I may have gotten one.
1,still itching!!,Since this was being sold very cheap I decided to give it a try...and yeap...my dogs stopped itching for a week and are back at it...so it is safe to say it didn't work ...
2,Did we price for age of Product???,"Last 2 tubes did not work on my dogs, thinking that it was age of product went to order new box and found that items price went up $14.00 from this seller, wow!! guess they do not want repeat customers, so I ordered from another seller off Amazon hopefully this seller will be better, if not will not buy from Amazon."
5,This is $10 less expensive through Amazon.com,"We have been using this product for 3 years with our dachshund dog. We usually buy the Advantage 20 at our local pet store. However, the cost is $10 less expensive through Amazon. It works great and Liam (our dog) has never contracted any fleas during the time we have been using this product. The solution was recommended by our vet."
1,Two Thumbs Down!,"Based on customers reviews and recommendations, i did purchase this product. However, i did not find advantage as effective as most others have. In fact, I did not find this product effective AT ALL. I wouldn't waste my money purchasing advantage. I treated three dogs (all under 10lbs like recommended)and also treated my entire house with carpet flea killer (just to make sure). The fleas did die within the first 12 hours, which gave me hope for my pour dogs, then two days later, the fleas are back! This treatment did NOT keep the fleas OFF. It only killed what was already on them. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This was a waste of $32!"
1,Disappointed ... My dog still has fleas,"I was so excited for this product to arrive. We had bug out come flea bomb our house, washed all our bedding, vacuumed our carpets and furniture, bathed our dog (again), applied this Advantage... And my dog still itches all.day.long with live fleas. I waited 3 weeks and reapplied, We still have fleas. Guess we will have to try Frontlne or Comfortis next."
5,No fleas with Advantage,"I have been using Advantage on my dogs for years. They have no fleas. It lasts for at least a month, even if they get wet."
3,Better than Frontline,It worked great but only for 10 days. After that dog was covered with fleas again. Still better than Frontline.
4,Package was crushed,"I don't see how to review the seller -- Pet Supplies 4 less. Regular Advantage is one of the milder (and thus least dangerous) flea treatments, and I have used it for years.This time the package was crushed. It came in a much too large cardboard box with a couple of paper wads. A much smaller mailing envelope with bubble wrap would have protected it better and caused the death of fewer trees."
2,pups with fleas,Its not the big name brand and it does take a couple of days to work but it finally took care of the problems. So far so good. Not sure if I would order again or not based on the two days it took to be active.
2,Very Slow Shipping,I've used this product for years... it now doesn't seem to be as effective as it once was.Won't buy this again on Amazon due to very slow shipping !
2,I bought the book for it's cover,I have to be honest when I say it was the cover of the book that sold me. Despite not having too many scantily clad babes in chainmail bikinis I still liked the stories. It was refreshing to be able to read a fantasy where the women are always in peril. The short stories are a quick read and something you do not have to but a lot of effort into following. A book that as easy to but down as it is to pick up.
2,Pun-nishment,"When I stumbled on this series, I thought ""this should be fun"" with good authors working with the opportunity to be creative and insightful and wise. Instead I read some simple, contrived, and boring stories that showed that the authors didn't ""get it"". From the nagging mother to the stories based on bad puns, I can't think of one story that I wanted to share with my wife. The Tamora Pierce ""Alanna"" series was more on target, even if it was a teen series."
4,"Guantanamo , a review of The Prisoner of Guantanamo","This book was very interesting to me, having worked in the Middle East. So, I liked some of the author's story-telling that centered on Islam. Of course, there were some flaws (thus the 4 stars).The ending was far-fetched. However, the discription of Guantanamo and the personnel who worked there was good. I liked it.Remember, it was a story. I wonder how much of it is true?"
5,Seeing Guantanamo behind the veil,"Read this book. If you're absolutely convinced the US government is systematically torturing detainees at Gitmo, you won't like the book. The villains will satisfy, because they're representative of the conservative crazies in Washington, but the real way the camps work is the way the protagonist does it. Fesperman does play up the interagency conflict, without communicating that FBI, CIA and military intel folks are looking for different things, and perhaps for artistic purposes doesn't explain that the ""other agencies"" are minority parts of the real picture.Read this book. Remember that it's a novel, with a fiction plot played out against a background that is absolutely true to life. The spies and wingnuts and crimes make a good story. The writing style may be disconcerting, the plot is convoluted, the final resolution isn't entirely clean or satisfying, but the book is well worth reading."
4,My 4th Fesperman - His Best So Far,"This author is definitely getting better and is beginning to remind me of Alan Furst but Fesperman positions his work in more contemporary settings and events. Here in his fourth, he takes the reader to Guantánamo Bay where we follow translator Revere Falk, an FBI interrogator. His past as a young, naive Marine plays an integral role that involves Cuban intelligence. This plot intersects with the American Intelligence community, Al-Qaeda, and the war on terrorism to create a layered mystery. It intrigues, the characters are believable and suitably suspicious, and the pace brisk enough. There is also sufficient detail to add credibility and this reflects the author's past as a hot-spot journalist who chased the true story. I look forward to reading his next book, The Amateur Spy."
4,VERY SOLID CHEESE SLICER,"To be honest, when i slice cheese I just prefer to use a good, old fashioned abd sharp Chef's knife. I've always hated the way cheese slicers leave that tiny bit of unsliced cheese at the bottom where the slicer does not go down all the way. That said i got this as a Christmas gift and it does a great job. It's good sized, feels comfortable in your hand and grips well. Best of all it's the favorite of the rest of the family who is not as comfortable around a chef's knife as I am. Nice item. Does it's job."
3,"Sturdy, But Not Adjustable...","This cheese slicer is great - if you like thick slices of cheese. If you want anything less than 1/8"", good luck! Your hand will have to be more steady than mine, otherwise, you're stuck with thick slices of cheese. On the positive side, this item like Kitchenaid's other utensils is sturdy and easy to keep clean. Check the big box discounters, I saw this for $4.99 after buying it for $7.99."
4,Screen Door Jesus,"This was a really good movie, watch it over and over! It's amazing how differently people believe. Some graphic language, so strictly for adult viewing. There is some comedy in the movie also. This movie is thought-provoking, and very interesting. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,the sword of Shannara,"this book has alot of characteristics of lord of the rings it has dwarfs, trolls, elves, men, wars agianst the races and two small people that all mankind lifes depend on as do all good and right"
3,Beware - No map of the Westland,"I recommend buying the individual books of the trilogy...this edition does not have a map of the westland, where The Elfstones of Shannara take place."
4,Good Get away read,This series is well written and it well help you get away from the dregs of a bad day. Pick it up. Read it.
2,Poor attempt to imitate Lord of the Rings,"Many Lord of the Rings elements are here (imitated ineptly), but none of the richness of that series nor is the reader drawn in as much as, say Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series (either of which I'd rate 5 stars). Brooks is fine for an airline trip, but I wouldn't push it beyond that. This is not a memorable read."
3,Fantasy Favorite,"The Sword of Shannara is an old favorite I am reading to discuss with my grandson, a new fantasy lover. The Trilogy is Terry Brooks early work and well worth reading. He improved greatly in later works. This trilogy is the foundation for reading Terry Brooks."
4,Surprisingly pleasant,I purchased this trilogy while waiting for another book to be released. I had read the Word and the Void trilogy in high school and thought I would give this one a shot. I must admit I have been thoroughly pleased with this trilogy as well.
2,Derivative,"OK, up front I'm a big Tolkien fan. Since the 70's. Never heard of this guy, but thought, well, I like this kind of stuff. Let's give him a try. Read the first story. Slowly. Started the second story. Gave up after about four chapters. You can see where this guy got all his ideas. Save time and just read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy again. I have 5 times. You won't be disappointed. With Terry Brooks, you will be."
4,Only read if you're ready to change,"Great book! Love his writing... am using this as a small group study right now, and it is the starting point for some great discussion and growth.Some points can be so direct, and hit you in the face... only read if you're seriously ready to change, to beome real with yourself, with others, and in your relationship with God."
2,Disappointing,"The Christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves, with our communities and with the world. All too often it isn't, and Steven James' target is a good one. Sadly this book is both overwritten and repetitive, and remarkably self-involved. Difficult to recommend."
5,These Guys Rock!!!,I met the Boys when they were playing acoustically in a very small venue. They are the perfect bluegrass band!
1,Closer to Heaven,#1 The story was not authorized by any member of Led Zeppelin.#2 The songs in the DVD is not Led Zeppelin's.#3 The songs in the DVD are horrible.#4 I am so disappointed in this. It was my fault that I purchased this. I shouldn't blame the seller for my mistake.Don't waste your money.
4,Wooden Numbers,These are great!! The magnet covers the entire back of the number so no more plastic numbers all over my kitchen floor. The plastic ones constantly fall off the fridge - these wood ones are durable and strong! I like the wooden bin with sliding plexiglass cover as well to keep them contained. I would recommend.
5,interesting to little ones too,My 14 month old loves the letters and numbers. They are bright and he loves to play with them on his on time. We have the magnetic board to go with them.
3,hmmm... same book!,"just a warning that there are 2 books by mitchell gibson with different titles and publishing dates, however they are the same. i ordered both, thinking that i was going to read 2 different books. not so...and not cool!"
1,"""Wild Bill"" Hickman",I found this book to be very informative on a factual and personal level as I am one of Hickman's descendants. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the early days of Utah.
5,An Outstanding Novel,"Of the many""war"" novels that I have read none have had the effect on me that this one did. With characterzations that hit very close to home. The novel shows a glimpse of an orgarization(the army) and a place(the united states in the 60's)in a state of change. Through the eyes of Jack Willow the inocense of youth is shown. Along with the exuzberance that goes with it. Jack wants nothing more then to go to Vietnam. Ceil Hazard a friend of Jack's father from WW2 tries to tell Jack of the horrors of war with little success. Samantha Huff becomes a love interest of Ceil's which adds to his continuing disillousment with his profession. One of a select few novels to successfully to switch time and place. At times extremely funny yet with an end that can break your heart. Few novels of Vietnam show as much depth in putting a spotlight in what was our nation's most costlist conflict."
4,"fairly wide and easy to get on, well made","I think that $14 is a little steep for these slippers, but seeing as it has been so hard for me to find slippers that stay on his wide feet, and these do, I'd do it again. The bottoms are good for playing outside (we take walks to the mail box together) and soft enough to running around the house all morning."
4,NICE. BUT NOT SO NICE,AFTER SEARCHING MANY WEB SITES LOOKING FOR SNAP-ON FENDERS I DECIDED TO BUY THE PYRAMID PRO MOPUNTAIN CLIP ON'S. I WAS PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT BUT IT LACKED INSTRUCTION AS TO HOW TO INSTALL THIS ITEM. TO THIS DAY I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT THE INSTALLATION PROCESS...
5,a powerful journey into self and a river,"A friend gave me this book before I left for a private trip on our raft down the Grand Canyon. I did not have a chance to read it before leaving. I had been fearful of the journey ahead. Upon returning I read the book cover to cover and felt as if I was reading my own journal. Never could I have imagined going on this trip with a small group let alone attempting anything close to Patricia's solo experience. I would go back to the Colorado River in a heartbeat! By sharing her experience, Patricia's book becomes a guide book in facing your fears head on, and the empowerment that comes as a direct result of doing so. We don't all have to run rivers, but it's a fantastic way of finding ourselves. Patricia shares the journey and even though I had just been there, I felt as if I was back on my raft! Thank Patricia!"
3,Kinda cool I guess.,"Got one of these as a gift, it was ordered from Amazon with no shipping issues.This knife is cool, however I found little use for it on a day to day basis.Sits in my box of knives at the moment =DI like it, however I just don't use it often."
3,nice reference,"This series provides a nice pocket reference for the Chinese radicals. If you learn by association, the humorous cartoons and the lists of words that fall under a radical will be useful in helping remember them. It includes both traditional and simplified characters and pinying.However, for learning and practice, I prefer ""Let's Learn Kanji: An Introduction to Radicals, Components, and 250 Very Basic Kanji"" for Japanese kanji, which can be adapted to learning Chinese characters."
1,Yawnfest,"Not many legends and very little flight. Lots of shots of the inside of a factory and engineers sitting around talking about airplanes. This is like watching a board meeting with a few eye candy videos mixed into a very uninteresting story. The 787? You really have to be into commercial aviation for this to be AT ALL interesting. To the average Joe, or military aviation fan, this is just a flying greyhound bus. Try,IMAX: The Magic of Flight [Blu-ray] MUCH better!"
4,another informational imax 3d show.,I have a number of these imax shows and they are all short and filled with interesting facts. They are not movies and should not judged by movie standards. they are all shot in hd and 3d too. It's about a new jetliner more than past legends of flight though. Making this one a more pro plane builder video in some ways. But it's got good graphics and other things. Like all imax productions this doesn't look as great as it did on the big screen and that's true of all 3d movies on home video.
3,Review of 3D movie - Legends of flight,"Well, there is some amount of info about the new Aircraft but I think much more was needed. Even the 3D effects are not very great, just normal. There is a lot more scope and much more efforts are required to make a movie worth buying."
3,Little more than an advertisement,"This is a 45-minute-long commercial for the Boeing 787. Little of substance was presented, and the flashy and unwelcome computer graphics, often appearing where a real plane should have been, served only to confirm the film's shallowness and one's feeling of being cheated out of viewing the real thing. But the airliner itself is beautiful to look at."
2,An hour long commercial for Boeing,"I bought this for my Dad, who builds airplanes for a living. Overall this was not the scientific documentary I imagined it would be. The main focus of the film seemed to be highlighting the newest goliath planes that are being built by Boeing and Airbus. Even for my Dad, it kind of boring,"
5,A must have for your training collection,"Michael Isner and Aaron Sims team up to bring XSI users up to speed with the latest version of Softimage's flagship Product XSI 4.0. This book takes users from modeling to animating the featured character with XSI and crowd simulation in Behavior.Experience XSI 4 is easy to follow and comprehend it covers the basics of XSI but also the technical aspects as well such as understanding the pivot and transform architecture, scripted operators, and programming quaternions to name a few.Isner and Sims provide strategies that are production proven and worthy while making the learning process a fun experience. I recommend this book to all XSI users new and old and to those curious to see XSI's workflow in a production environment."
1,same old romance novel,Actualy I'm 13 but who cares. This book was graphic. If you know what I mean. The same old remance novel. From what it said about the book on the back cover you couldn't tell it was a romance novel. I thought it was going to be a thriller or a horror. I guessed wrong. If you like the same old same old romance novel get the book but if your into vampire thriller horor this isn't the book for you. Hope this was helpful!
1,Product recall,"I never received this item as it was recalled by the manufacturer. Obviously, I can not submit a positive review."
1,Don't waste you money,This stuff does NOT work. The worms will disappear for 2 days only. I repeated the tabs after 3 weeks per my vet's instructions. Tapeworms have a 3 week lifecycle so you must give the meds 2x. Still the worms came back. My dogs were not being reinfested as they do not have fleas. They got the worms from eating a rodent. My vet said the over-the-counter stuff is not strong enough.
3,Could have been better,"This book contains many useful phrases for travel in Bulgaria, but unfortunately, my copy contained double copies of pages 34-66, and no pages 67 to 99. Luckily, I have not yet encountered any emergency situations here, but If I had, I would have been at a loss for what to say! Upon bringing this to the attention of the publisher, DK suggested that I mail back the defective copy, at my own cost."
5,Hook is the best!,"The most varied and interesting of cryptic puzzlers, Hook surpasses himself in this last edition. But when will we see a new one?"
5,great read,"every book has aspects that are debatable. we are supposed to separate the ""good"" and the ""bad"" on our own. this was a great book. i started taking some of the aminoacids , based on the questionnaires in the book, and I found it helpful."
4,The right information for extra health support,"The program in this book is finely tuned for folks with any of a number of common mood-related health issues. This is a good complement to general health, diet, nutrition guides for those who need a little bit of something extra."
5,"This works! It's easy to read, interesting & FAST!","This book was recommended to me several times before I went and bought it. Now, I am so glad I did! The Mood Cure has a easy questionnaire which makes it quick to identify what symptoms you are experiencing and what amino acids you may be lacking. I invested in the book along with a bottle of amino acids that costs me less than $12 and I can't tell you how much happier I am. One of the best investments of my life. I had what Julia explains in the book as the ""Blahs"". I began taking Tyrosine and it worked wonders on me. I have so much energy and feel a sense of well being, happiness, joy. It's wonderful! I am a Certified Theta Healing Instructor and Practitioner and I recommend this book to all my clients. Great information, easy to read and life changing! Thanks Julia... from Dawn in Palm Springs"
2,Not backed up with any real science.,"Although some of the theories seem plausible, it is all based on anecdotal information. She needs to do controlled studies. Also, she tries to simplify cures to very complicated diagnoses. Diet and nutrition certainly have a role in much of our modern health and mental health issues, but it is not a cure-all."
1,THERE ARE MUCH BETTER FATS WALLER RECORDS THAN THIS ONE,"I am a very great Amazon aficionado, but this is the second time recently that I have been disappointed by Amazon.The music is not bad, but most of it is from live performances and the MC is definitely non-cool. The CD would be much better without all the extraneous interruptions to the music.The CD insert is disgraceful. The only information we are given are the names of the numbers. One page is taken up completely by superfluous information telling us how good the record producer is. Unfortunately, he is not very good at all and obviously knows nothing about the music.There is none of the information that jazz collectors require:No personnel details; no recording dates; no details of where the recording was made; no composer information.This record is a disgrace to Amazon."
4,Not Bad,"It does what it says, makes fake flatulence sounds. Sometimes it sounds a little too ""electronically"" but I guess it does come from an electric speaker.All together, it's fun to play with. Sounds better if muffled in a back pocket with the speaker turned toward your rear. It takes away from the volume and makes it seem more authentic. It will annoy your wife in the long run so be careful guys!"
4,Love this humidifier,We've had one humidifier for 2 years and another for a year (put on on top floor and one on main floor). My only complaint is the sensor is too close to the unit so reads higher than it really is. We wrapped something around the sensor to keep it running. Works nicely and the sound level is perfect for us.
1,outdated and discontinued GPS unit - Don't buy,"Don't buy this item! Bought it last week for Real Estates needs... The unit couldn't even recognize the street I've been living on for about 6 years (Tennessee). Drove the unit around and same status for most streets, even after updating the ICN with StreetST 2005 edition that came with it and after one online udate. Called Navman Cust. Svc. for answers... The Rep told me the unit has been discontinued and can't receive new updates!! So if you need to locate recently developed streets and cities in the US, don't buy this unit!"
1,There is no map update for this unit.,The hardware and software interface is OK. But the map is out dated and there is no way to upgrade it.... I do not recommend this GPS unit.
1,Thoroughly Worthless Book,"One thing I'm happy about is that I didn't pay full price. What a waste of paper and cardboard. There's nothing new in this book, nothing you couldn't find elsewhere. It's actually written in the first person, believe it or not, as evidenced by the not so infrequent ""I never liked such and such"" or ""I found it to be."" After a while, who cares? And evidently, the author didn't rate either a first rate editor or a fact checker. For example, there's no ""e"" after the ""g"" in judgment. He does this repeatedly. Moreover, for someone allegedly so well-versed in the entertainment industry, he's apparently rather ignorant of some basic knowledge. When discussing Reagan's inaugural parties planned by Sinatra, Clarke mentions ""someone named Ben Vereen who performed in blackface"", and then trashes Sinatra's ""judgement"" in arranging such entertainment. Uh, Mr. Clarke, Ben Vereen WAS black, he couldn't help BUT be in blackface!"
2,Whatever Watch,"I really like this watch, but have had a hard time finding a place to put a battery in it. Seems stores are afraid to break something. but, I'll keep checking until I find a place."
2,OK at Best,"Thin, not especially flavorful, and inconvenient to prepare. I can't understand the enthusiastic reviews for this product. I love Thai food and this was a disappointment."
2,tastes horrible. ick!,"now, i love alot of the other dr. mcdougall's noodle cups, but this one is just bad. it doesn't taste like pad thai at all. it doesn't even taste good. i'm giving it two stars because, yes, it was simple to make and it's pretty healthy...other than that, i think i'm being very generous. try the Miso flavor! it's *much* better!"
1,Only because there is no zero option,This concoction was as bitter as a divorce after 20 years of marriage. I have thrown the other 5 cups away. Disgusting. Over powering bitter taste with the scent of a tinge of over ripe garbage. The good doctor should be charged with attempted poisoning.
5,Blackmore influenced? Yeah ! So what?,"This one ROCKS! The songs are very well arranged, the singers great, and Stuart Smith is a superfine guitar player. I think he needs to seek his musical individuality, as he plays a lot like Blackmore. What the hell, if you have to sound like somebody else, better be like the best there is. Anyway, I was totally blown away by this disc, and I reccomend it for the rocker and blues lover. And keep an open eye, this man is gonna make a lot of good stuff in the future."
3,smell is overwhelming,"I should have known I wouldnt like the smell, since I am very sensitive to all smells, but this one gave me a splitting headache within 10 minutes. Other than the smell, it feels great!"
3,Beloved Stranger,"Lachlan Macclean and Kimbra Charlton are natural enemies with him a Scot and her an Englishman. Their countries are at war and Lachlan's people killed her husband, but neither knows that. Lachlan's memory has fled and all he knows is how much he cares for the young widow and her daughter. Even as Kimbra nurses the injured Scot, he begins to take on an important role in her life, but the past is sure to catch up with him and ruin their seedling of happiness for they live in dangerous times.*** This emotional read uses many conventional tools of romance in a way that though not completely original is well done. Ms. Potter effectively uses shadows and light to paint word pictures that will linger in your mind. ***Amanda Killgore"
2,Not really a board book,"We already had the book 10 Little Ladybugs and it was one of my daughter's favorites. Unfortunately, the pages are made of a thick paper and can't stand up to a baby. We couldn't let her play with the book unattended as we had already had to piece it back together once. I was very excited to see on Amazon a board book version of 5 Little Ladybugs and immediately ordered it for my daughter so she could have a copy that she could play with by herself. I expected the pages to be thick and sturdy like other baby board books, something that could stand up to a toddler or baby. However, the pages are the same thick paper as the 10 Little Ladybugs book. I was very disappointed as she would destroy this book quickly too. We will probably hold onto it as a gift for someone since it is a very nice little book. I just wish they had a sturdier version."
3,Waiting Game,I gave this movie only 3 stars. It was an ok movie. I did receive it on the day promised. I am always satisfied with everything I have purchased from Amazon.
2,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"Tori Amos has lots of talent, but this album is a little ridiculous. I don't know about anyone else, but i want to hear more compelling piano, and less ridiculous band..kinda like a tori amos unplugged or something. I can't take these songs with this lite rock feel. I miss songs like ""Mother"" and ""winter"" geeeeeeeeeeeeeeez!"
1,Horrendous,"Total disappointment. She had so much talent in some of her previous works. This is devoid of excitement, charisma, and the inimitible Amos spark that permeated her better works. Without a doubt her most lackluster performance, sad to say."
4,Something for the Rest of Us,This album is a great escape from Tori's traditional style of song writing. It is much softer and sweeter then those of the past and even those that came after. It's Tori toned down. This album is one that I feel the entire family can listen to and enjoy. This is only the second time that Tori has created an album that was toned down and softened up. She did a great job doing it too. Some of the songs you can sing along to and get to know by heart. I would highly recommend this album to anyone that likes Tori but wants something less intense.
2,Forgettable...not like her at all.,"I am a huge Tori Amos fan, and have been for the past twelve years. This record is the biggest disappointment in her catalogue. None of the songs sound terrible when listening to them, but a couple of days later, I cannot, for the life of me, recall what the hell they sound like. I rank ""The Beekeeper"" even lower than ""Strange Little Girls"" because, while at least half of that album was spectacularly awful, none of it was forgettable. This record is just bland. Dull. It sounds, to my ear, like an uninspired retread of the same ground covered on its predecessor, the stellar ""Scarlet's Walk."" I have always considered Tori the ultimate ""love-her-or-hate-her"" artist, and I never would have dreamed that she was even capable of making such a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" album."
2,Hard to tell one song from another,"I've come to expect a lot more from a musical genius like Tori Amos. Deep, sensual moods, precisely ""designed"" music and poetic lyrics. Sorry, none of that here. This album meanders from one song to the next without offering the slightest reason to pay any attention to it. I guess a cushy, suburban lifestyle will do that to you..."
2,Okay,"I am a very big Tori fan and maybe I haven't been keeping up with her, but I was disappointed with this CD. As a caveat, I do have A Piano: the collections and I found that every song that I really liked off of The Beekeeper was in the collections CD and those songs were strong, very strong. If I knew what I know now, I would not have bought it but then that is mainly from the fact that I already have the songs that I liked. If I had neither, I would buy A Piano: The collections and not buy the Beekeeper."
4,Listen to it a few times before you bash it...,"I am a huge Tori Amos fan - I will admit this album will take some getting used to. Tori has changed her style slightly since her ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" days but I still thoroughly enjoy this album.The highlights of this album are ""Parasol"", ""Mother Revolution"", and ""Ireland"". The song ""Witness"" is absolute crap - to say it bluntly.On the overall, I can't stop listening to this album - go buy it!!! It is Tori, afterall."
5,Sweet the Sting,"I recently read ""Piece by Piece"" by Tori Amos & Ann Powers, so I was looking forward to the release of the CD. (In the book, Tori discusses the inspiration for some of the tracks on ""The Beekeeper"" as well as her other albums). As with ""Scarlet's Walk,"" Tori's piano takes center-stage. I can't really compare her albums, as they are all so different and compelling in their own ways. But I know this one will not be leaving my CD player anytime soon.I haven't read any comments on ""Sleeps with Butterflies"" yet - this is the song that Tori recently performed on the Today show & David Letterman. Everything about this song is amazing. Sometimes people have said that Tori writes ""difficult"" lyrics, and this may be true (I still don't know what she's talking about sometimes) but I did notice on this album, she is really reaching outwards and speaking to universal feelings & truths.Tori has, throughout her career, always created her own genre. She once again delivers on ""The Beekeeper."""
3,Not for the old time fan of Tori,"I have always like Tori Amos, but her last few albums have lacked her dark angst and haunting lyrics. They seem to lack inspiration and drive, and this album is really no different. Some of the songs are catchy, but they all sound poppy, almost a hip-hop feel.The album seems formulaic and Top 40-esque. Most devout fans of Tori have followed her because she was different, intelligent, and dark. Now, she seems to have followed Liz Phair and Jewel. What a disappointment. All you old time Torie fans, stick with her old albums and forget To Venus and Back and The BeeKeeper. Its not worth your time."
2,"Pretty, pretty radio fare","Lots of buzz and sap, little Tori. When has she ever resorted to so many clichés, lyrically (""take a walk down memory lane"") and musically (accompaniment overload)? This is definitely not the woman who pounded out ""Cornflake Girl"" ten years ago, nor the one who sang of the ""lollipop Gestapo."" Very disappointing. Expect some schmaltzy duet or car commercial (Saab?) soon."
1,Terrible Service,The supplier should be ashamed for doing business this way. As of yet I have had no response from my e-mails and no product. This company should be banned from doing business with you. Is there anything that can be done?
1,Duke of Uke - Bill Tapia,"I enjoyed this because of my many trips to HA and seeing Bill Tapia on PBS TV (KCET in L.A.). For those who have not traveled to HA or saw this TV program, this may have not interest to them."
4,A must-have for the Michael Stanley fan,"A great start for Michael - the original Rosewood Bitters kicks off this one, you can find other versions on Stagepass, Right Back at Ya, and Live from Tangiers (also recorded by Joe Walsh on The Confessor). Also includes the original version of Moving Right Along, one of the MSB concert staples of the 70's. Has Joe Walsh, Rick Derringer, Todd Rundgren and Joe Vitale in the backup band. With friends like that.......songs are just like ladies, can't forget them when you're thru and they're always on your mind... my favorite MS lyric"
1,Observation of a Laughter Yoga Class,"If you want to be a spectator of a Laughter Yoga class, then this CD is perfect for you. The intro was good - talked about the history and purpose of Laughter Yoga. The rest of the video is just watching them do the session without any explanation of what they are doing or why they are doing it. The sound quality is also horrible. There was even a loud plane flyng over at one point that was very distracting. I don't recommend this video."
1,A horrible book on how to blame longstreet!!,"This book is one of the most disrespectul books,in attention to Luiet.Gen James Longstreet,and his actions at gettysburg. The author clearly tries to shift blame onto longstreet,and keep every possible thing from being gen lee's fault.Plainly stated, this book's idias are not well founded,and the book is very,very drawn out."
5,Fits my phone fine,I installed the device in my wife's Mustang. The fit was perfect. I had to use the spacers because her cell phone wasn't very wide. It is a good product for a reasonable price.
2,Dull Blades,"I like the Merkur brand and I have been shaving exclusively with a Merkur safety razor and Merkur blades for a few years. So, I was really disappointed by this trimmer.The problem is that the Merkur blades for this trimmer are not in any way comparable to the standard Merkur double edged safety razor blades. The blades for this trimmer are actually quite dull.To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of the blades on properly prepped skin. The standard double edged Merkur blade glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade on the other hand catches and hesitates on every single hair.This trimmer might be a nice if one could find sharp blades for it. But, unfortunately, there are no such blades."
4,Brave,"I started inmediately and could not stop till I had finished it. This is remarkable, because nowadays I find rarely books that are unputdownable.It is a real impressive human document in which a young woman copes with her longing to live, the unfairnes in life, and the struggle she has in accepting the fact that one day she will have to let go.Her zestfull character, broad intrest in politics,culture, music and other people give the book an extra dimension."
4,Jetfire Rules,This Toy is Very Cool! When I saw the first armada edition of this guy i thought it was the coolest version of jetfire. I changed my mind this one is. the other jetfire only looked good in Shuttle mode. This one looks cool in both. the only problem i have with this toy is that i dont like the color when it is in shuttle mode becuz it doesnt look like a real shuttle. overall this toy is tyte!!!
2,"Stupid looking, but a great Autobot","I like it when they sell Jetfires, but this is WAY 2 much. When I bought a recolor of Jetfire,(Overcast) it was kinda awesome. I didn't know Hasbro makes good space shuttles. The color makes a nice Jetfire. His head in robot mode looks dopey. Under it was the Powerlinx logo. It was kind of scary, but every Powerlinx Autobot has them. When my cousin got Prowl, I didn't know he had one. It was under his chest(which looks like a shield)the whole time. The Armada Jetfire's space shuttle mode was more, you know, futuristic. At his chest, there were Capture Claws. But I like it and it is great."
3,"Good, but is too Bible-centric.","Although the author presents a good case for the existence of God, using modern scientific theory, he relies too much on the Christian dogma to fill in the gaps left by science. He also seems to waffle at times between the inerrant position (which states that the Bible is divinely inspired and is factually correct) and the more traditional Christian position such as the original Church founders posited, which is, simply, the Bible isn't to be taken literally all the time. (The inerrant position is a 20th century Fundamentalist creation.) All in all, a good work for people trying to reconcile their belief in a Supreme Creator with modern space sciences."
5,I don't see how anyone can deny what's in the book,"I don't see how any educated person can doubt in God. If you believe in the big bang theory, there are just too many things that the natural can not explain. For example, where did the sphere in the big bang theory come from? I have a degree is in Mechanical Engineering, so I have scientific training. Basically, anyone who believes in the big bang theory has to come up with a natural explaination of how something can come from nothing. Of course, this goes against the laws of thermodynamics. So, in coming up with an explaination, you will be going against all of our current laws. There are so many things that this book points out. It's not things that can be refuted, either. Natural scientific facts. I've always said that if you have any scientific training (which you don't have to go to college to get) you have no choice but to believe in God. This book prooves it."
3,A Place to Start,"For anyone looking for background or critical information on Heinlein and his works, this book is a good place to start. It is well written, informative, interesting, and also attempts to explain what is meant by ""Science Fiction."" Panshin also reveals his views on what a story should consist of. However, as a work of criticism, the book is very flawed. Panshin often makes assertions that cannot be backed up by fact, and his anyalysis is many times far to narrow to be taken seriously. If nothing else, Panshin's book is a good place to find key issues of contention that are often brought up by Heinlein critics. It is not, however, a place to find praise of Heinlein as an author or final answers to any questions regarding his works. Heinlein himself claimed that he never read the book nor met Alexei Panshin."
1,Not effective,It has been three weeks since I administered to a 27lb beagle. There are more fleas now than when administered. Back to Advantix.
2,Worked for about two days - Switched to Advantage,"We have no complaints with the vendor whatsoever, just the product. It worked for about two days, in repelling fleas, but the cats were scratching and suffering after that point. We switched to Advantage when safe enough to administer the next dosage, and all has been well since."
5,great product,"Great product, works better than the topical solution. I find the occasional flea here and there, but not as much ad when using frontline or advantix."
5,"Fantastic, Entertaining and Thought-Provoking","""Easier Said Than Done"" is a fantastic, entertaining, and thought-provoking debut novel, written by Nikki Woods that without a doubt kept my attention from the first page until the last. Her characterization and her vibrant descriptions are top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed following the journey of its protagonist, Kingston Phillips, as well as the other characters within the book. And, having the plot in Jamaica was the icing on the cake. Woods is a very talented writer and I highly recommend this book. I look forward to reading other books written by Woods in the near future.Carla J. CurtisAuthor of Grip the Rope: Prayers for Single Mothers"
3,Good delivery,Item was delivered earlier than expected. Nice delivery service. The sensor looks new. I can't comment on the actual quality or reliability of the Oxygen Sensor. I have not used it and it is likely I will not use it since it is the wrong sensor for my 2 litre 2002 Honda Accord. I didn't want to go through that headache of returning the item so I may have to just keep it as a souvenir or look for a buyer and sell it cheaply.
5,Nearly a perfect fit,"Installed on an '81 Honda Accord. It was the same brand as OEM and fit perfectly. The only difference from OEM was the cable was slightly longer (12"" instead of 8"") so I had to be careful with the routing. Before installation the car failed smog, after it passed just fine.... so it did exactly what I had hoped. The original lasted 170,000 miles... if this one lasts half that long I'll be very happy!"
5,Just as much fun for parents!,"I first took this book to my 3-year-old son's preschool class to read to all the little kiddos when they were studying food groups. Now, my 3-year-old son loves this book because of the personalities of the various foods and the rhythm of the storytelling. He can recite it almost from memory. He loves it so much that lines from the book sometimes become punch lines in our day-to-day conversation. ""Hey, wait for me, the ketchup cried!"" he will shout and giggle as he's trying to catch up while walking. As the parent, I love the plays on words--it's so creative and captures my interest, as well. This book and ""Pigeon Finds a Hotdog"" are my son's all-time favorite books."
2,Very slow delivery.,"Arrived a week after the shipping delivery estimate. Also, portion size very small for the price."
4,The Delany Sisters Reach High,Gave this as a gift to a set of twins. Their mom reads it to them often. They love it!
3,Adequate but did not meet expectation...,"This CD case is intended to hold 64 CDs or DVD. Since the CD sleeves are 'built' into the case (cannot be removed), the assumption was that the case could be easily closed when full. Since there is a net (in the front of the case) for miscellaneous items, the assumption is that at least the carry strap can be put in this net when the case if full (as this is where the manufacturer put the carry strap). However, when I filled the case and left the carry strap inside the net, the case was hard to close. I had to leave a few sleeves empty in order to put anything (including the carry strap) in the net holder at the front of the case...if I wanted to close the case easily.I liked the smaller size of this vaultz case but wish they had either made it slightly wider...to accomodate the 64 CDs/DVDs and, at least the carry strap in the case, or had fewer sleeves as this would have allowed more room to store the carry strap."
1,That's time I'll never get back,"I wonder how this ever made it out of editing. Really bad acting. Terrible cinematography. Save yourselves, this is something you can't un-see."
3,Mixed Bag,"I ordered eight mugs after my brother got one for my mom. After a couple uses, her mug developed a small crack. I noticed of the eight new mugs I purchased (through the order 4, pay for 3 deal), one had a small crack, five mugs had small hairline scratches, and two were unscratched. The mugs look great, I just wish the mugs were more scratch resistant."
4,really nice but fragile,"I purchased the ingenuiTEA and the mug together. I received mine in perfect condition. Yes, it seems to be very fragile and I will probably break mine and will not order another. You could use practically any mug for the ingenuiTEA. I do love the mug it is very light and holds a pretty cup of tea but it is not necessary."
2,Not to size,"I have the Adagio Ingenious Teapot and got their mug to use with it. But surprisingly the mug doesn't fit. Now the teapot will dispense into the mug but what I mean is that the mug ""floats"" under the teapot. Before I bought the Adagio Mug I was using a common ceramic coffee mug with the same capacity and the top rim fit the bottom of the teapot just perfectly. The Adagio Teapot can be slide all over the top of the Adagio Mug.Now it's not likely the teapot, with its wide base, will flip off the mug but you think Adagio would have a mug with the top rim the same diameter as the teapot base."
5,A highly relevant guide for a beginner in wu shu,"I began training wu shu half a year ago so I am definitely a beginner in the area. My perspective may therefore be limited - on kung fu as well as any literature on the topic- but I would anyhow like to post some thoughts I have over this book.The reason I bought it was to learn more about the origin, philosophy and any religious aspects of kung fu. And a believe I truly got what I was looking for! It was easily read and logically structured. It did not fear to go into some depth in areas such as Taoism and other philosophcal influences on kung fu. And it did - on top of that- give what I believe to be a good overview of the historical development and current day many different 'dialects' of kung fu.I am happy I bought and would definitely do it again!"
5,Negotiate to Win,"I bought the book because I was scheduled to go to a seminar of the same name.... I reluctantly started it thinking I was going to have to choke down a couple pages a day. Much to my surprise, I LOVED it! The content is very practical and usable...and.... the manner in which Jim shares the message is not only entertaining, but downright funny. Highly recommend the book....as well as the seminar."
3,get the drops,"This works very well but if your dog has flea allergies, use the drops instead. That way, your dog won't have to suffer while the fleas in the yard die off(in my case, from the neighbors dogs)."
4,"it works, but it takes a little patience","We developed a terrible flea infestation when our local flea population became resistant to first Advantage, then Frontline. At first I thought Program wasn't working either, but it took a little over a month to begin really noticing a difference. Now we're not completely flea-free, but it seems to be under control."
2,Not Recommended,My dog have been using this product for 1 month. She is now getting fleas badly. Her skin was irritated and itched terribily. I had to take her to the doctor for different kind of medicine. I wasted the money. And it is not cheap. Very disappointed. Never buy this again.
4,as long as you're ok with killing flea eggs only,"I use it for my cat to help prevent fleas. However he tends to run out and probably collect more adult fleas which I'm interested in killing/preventing infestation immediately. Keep in mind this medicine only kills flea eggs and does not work as immediately as the topical flea medicines. I would prefer to mix this stuff into his food and not have to deal with wrangling my cat down to apply cold topical on his bare skin but in the end, I think I have to go back to the topical. :("
3,very thin,I had to return this item because I wasn't aware it would be so thin. It's practically see-through.
1,Choice of games. Are you kidding me.,"I am a diehard Cowboy fan but I can't possibly buy this due to the choice of games.The 1999 game was a classic and I could live with its inclusion but the 1997 and 2007 games are a joke. In 1997 the Cowboys were 6 and 10, the Redskin game that year was a good game but not an all time classic and the 2007 game should not have even been considered. I don't think a broadcast of the 1974 Thanksgiving game exists but the comeback games of 1979 and 1983 should have been no brainers. How does the 2007 and 1997 games get included before either the 79 or 83 games."
5,A Wonderful Love Adventure!,"Elizabeth Lowell has a wonderful gift of taking you into the adventure with her descritions of the Utah landscape, the excitement and terror of the terrain and the urgency of hiding from the renegade Indians. The love and the agony caused by the unrequited love Janna feels for Ty is very heartrending, you really get a sense of her loneliness and yearning for Ty's love to be returned. Dunce that he is , he almost leaves it too late to come to the realization that he really does love Janna. I would love to see the terrain in Utah that was Janna's world. This book will be a part of my permanent library."
3,Bajan Girl,Book one of her series. I had read book 2 and 4 and wanted to read the beginning story. This book is very predictable with graphic love scenes. No deep story line but an easy read for those times that you are so stressed that complicated books are too much.
3,Bad tempered hero,"Lowell can definitely write a stroy. I just wish the hero had not been such an abusive hunk. He gets saved from certain death, seduces, then abuses the heroine. She should have socked him in the chops and found someone who appreciated her."
3,starts out well...,"I have had insomnia for 20 years or so. Sleep'n Restore worked well at first, but after awhile I didn't get any benefits from it. I also think that I am allergic to one of the ingredients."
5,"Deep, refreshing sleep, naturally induced, no groggy mornings","I came across this referred by a friend. Melatonin alone didn't do it for me, but this combination of Melatonin, Valarian Root, grape seed extract and other natural nutrition does the trick. I sleep all the way through, even with diabetes and sleep apnea, and I feel refreshed in the morning. It IS important to give yourself 8 hours to sleep, so if you have to be back up in 4 hours it may leave you a LITTLE sleepy, still, but nothing like the prescription stuff the doctor used to prescribe for me.Works well, and I'm grateful for it!"
2,Not the greatest sleep aid,"I used this product years ago with great results. This time it seemed to help for a few nights, and then I was unable to sleep again. I now have it sitting on a shelf, maybe I will try again every once in awhile, but definitely not consistent results."
2,sleep n restore,"was not impressed with this product. It did not help me sleep at all,and in addition the pills smell horrible!"
2,"Discussion of ""Secret weapons of WW2""","This book was a bit of a disappointment. Too many short stories, when some more detail would have been interesting. Also, the material does not seem that carefully researched. The author described that the German battleship Bismarck escaped unscathed from its encounter with Hood/PoW, but several other sources I have read states that Bismarck was damaged. Later in the same chapter it is described that Rodney and King George V hit Bismarck with their 16-inch shells. Rodney had 16-inch, true, but KGV had only 14-inch guns.I would recommend it as a second-hand book, but it is not worth the full price."
4,yeah it was pretty good,This book was extremely repetitive but the words base is good.. It has a very easy step by step set up and is excellent for a self teaching device.
2,Good story; bad writing/editing,"I enjoyed the characters and the plot but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I hated the transitions from scene to scene, characters were introduced very poorly, and the chapters ended very abruptly. I hope this is just a case of poor editing because the characters are good. Let's hope the next book is better done."
1,"Piece of junk,","Don't buy this Piece of junk, The fingertip cable control for easy on/off is junk will not close stays open the numbers are not accurate."
2,There's better paranormal romance...,"I love paranormal romance and based on the amazon reviews thought this would be a winner. Master of Wolves was a fast read, but I didn't find myself drawn into the story. I expect complex, developed characters where the reader becomes invested in their story and outcome. This book just didn't do it for me.When the author started explaining the background mythos, she totally lost my respect. I have a pretty vast willing suspension of disbelief - but Merlin being an alien? Arthur is a vampire? I actually laughed with disbelief and had a hard time forgiving it. Granted, this is the fourth book in the series, so perhaps it would feel more plausible if I'd read them first.My suggestion - if you're into werewolves skip this one and read ""Killng Moon"" by Rebecca York"
3,It's okay but not as good as before,"AK usually writes some pretty steamy stuff but this book made me feel like I couldn't wait for it to end. I got bored with the sappy emotions from the so call ""alpha"", Jim London. I mean it is okay if you just want to read something but I would wait for a used copy."
2,In Flames Continues To Slide,"This album is really disappointing - but expected. It is a predictable continuation of their new sound. Ever since Reroute, In Flames has adopted a nu-metal sound that is leaving fans of their old stuff wondering what happened. They have completely abandoned their raw, Gothenburg melodeath sound. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a good death metal album."
3,Eh...,"This is the latest In Flames album, and my second one to purchase. I was expecting something very much like Reroute to Remain. Instead I get a very mediocre display in music.Right away I got a bad feeling about the album. It's not at all what I expected, so maybe it's my fault for not liking it. Then again, maybe not. It's really not an easy listen like Reroute to Remain was. I feel like In Flames should stick to what there good at. There weren't many outstanding musical or vocal moments. There are a few songs I enjoyed, but only a few. It was all in all very disapointing. But you should give it at least a try if you like In Flames."
4,Nice backpack,"This is a really nice backpack. it is well constructed and feels like it will last. There is plenty of storage. I like the water bottle holder that folds into the side and zips up when not in use. The only disappointment is the depth of the pocket on the front below the logo. From the pictures, it looks like it is really deep, perhaps going to the bottom of the bag. However, it is only a few inches deep. I was hoping to be able to put boarding passes in there without folding them. I now use that pocket for all of the loose change that I accumulate during travel."
4,A cauldron-full of information!,"This beautiful calendar is jam-packed with information for the magically-minded. Each month has a theme, such as ""scrying,"" and features a related article and recipe. The blocks for each day list moonphases and other astrological details, as well as interesting historical trivia, such as birthdays of key figures and significant events. Not much room at all to write in your own appointments and such, but then, maybe that's what the companion ""Datebook"" is for. Overall, it's beautifully done, and really fills a void."
2,War of Honor by David Weber,"Nearly all of David Weber books are so good that you cannot put them down. His latest however is not in that category. Lenghty political discussions with petty and small minded characters do not require 700 pages, but 70. The remaining 100 being good.However the broad painting of this universe remain well written and not too boring if one reads fast."
2,All work no fun,"An avid fan of Honor Harrington and all of Weber's books I found War of Honor to be extremely disappointing. At times I found myself wondering why I continued to read since it ended up being work instead of fun.I kept waiting for Weber to finish laying the groundwork and get to the fighting...he does finally have a couple sparsely developed battles 95% of the way through the book...well below par for a David Weber book.A well written political intrigue that leaves you disappointed in how a few politicians set empires against each other and how the admission of one word will start a war...Other reviewers stated they thought this book was setting the stage for future Honor novels, unfortunately the development of both sides over the course of his 10 books leaves me wanting the Peeps and the Star Nation to make peace, not war...he needs to find a new enemy for them both."
2,"""Bore"" of Honor","I've read through every single one of the books in the HH series so far, cover to cover--including this one. This was, by far, the most difficult read of the series for me. I found myself tempted to skip entire chapters at every turn. The pacing was glacial. The focus on politics and ""behind the scenes"" discussion amongst leaders of both sides, while quite possibly realistic, does *not* make for an interesting book. Fans of the series expecting epic space battles and the thrill and terror of war will be so happy when the action finally starts they're likely not to mind it's over in the blink of an eye.The repeated back-and-forth political scenes showing how both Haven and Manticore discuss the exact same thing gets really tiring, really quickly. Unfortunately, that's literally the majority of the book.I guess if you're really into political science, this could be your cup of tea.Definitely hoping ""At All Costs"" is much, much better."
1,Little Honor,"This is the weakest of the Honor books. Way to much character dialog that has been done before. Very little action. And most important....VERY little of Honor herself.Mr. Weber, please return to the dialog & action of the other Honor books & rember why we buy the ""Honor"" series.Hint......that would be for HONOR!"
4,Yes and No...,"Well, I do tend to agree with several of the reviewers that the ""internal monologues"" are a bit too prevelant in this, ""War of Honor""... and that there is a bit too much ""strategy review"" going on... This is true of the entire series and one thing I wish Weber would find another way to introduce what is necessary about these ""background thoughts"". But, in spite of all that, I disagree with those who claim that Weber has run out of gas... The plot in this story moves along quite well (not at tautly as, for example, ""In Enemy Hands""). But, I see much of this as being the set up for the next adventure for Admiral Dame Honor Harrington and Steadholder Harrington."
3,"Starts slow, but then returns to Weber's usual form","Weber departs from his usual action-oriented style that we know and love for the first half of this book. I found myself just plodding through it in honor (pun intended) of the loyalty I've developed in reading the previous nine books in this series. Fortunately, the pace picks up in the second half of the book and I finally found myself in the mode I love - not wanting to put the book down. I'm eagerly awaiting the next book, but hope Weber reads some of these reviews and watches the movie ""Wonder Boys."" Some good editorial decisions would have taken 200 pages out of the manuscript and brought this up to the level we expect from one of the genre's best writers."
2,Lengthy and slow,"I found this book to be a disappointment. It was much too long and had far too many subplots. I have enjoyed most of the Honor Harrington books, but this one diverges from the usual without adding to the series. Honor is in love, but we are supposed to believe she is naieve as a teenager about it and its consequences. There are side plots that have very little to do with the story. The battles that we have come to expect don't occur until the very end of the book. The book ends with most of the conflict unresolved."
4,A transistion book - don't expect much action,"Unlike the rest of the Honor Harrington series, War of Honor is decidedly lacking in action. Much time is spent filling in background stories, and developing the political situation into one that will allow continuation of the story in future books. What action there is comes late in the book and lacks much of the detail characteristic of Weber's previous Honor Harrington novels.One irritating point about the development of the political situation is the consistent lack of due diligence in montioring communications by leaders on both sides of the Manticoran / Havenite negotiations. I understand that David Weber needed to contrive some way setting up the conflict for future books, but the idea that NO ONE would have noticed blatant tampering streches reality a litte thin. As a result, the complex characters that David Weber spends so much time developing do not ""feel"" as real as they otherwise would have."
3,Give my love to you is the best song in the world!!,"I love Forte's song, Give my love to you!! It reminds me of my relationships with my boyfriend, Jonathan!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Songs are not by original artists!,"Although the music is good, the ""various"" is misleading as the songs are not done by the original artists and instead performed by an orchestra . . .not at all what i expected . . .!"
3,not what i expected.....,"I bought this book with the hope that it would detail the eating habits of those living in the paleolithic era. While there may be some valuable info on that in the book, it was extremely dry and somewhat unapproachable. Interesting but I wouldn't recommend it to someone just curious about paleo eating habits."
3,"An interesting, occasionally hilarious read","While it certainly isn't the great American novel, Hornito provides an interesting way for gay male readers to pass the time. I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris, but only occasionally did Hornito draw me in like Sedaris does. A few hearty belly laughs, a handful of smiles..."
1,not worth your time,"This book is not worth reading. If you're looking for a meaningful coming of age story, this is not it. If you're looking for a steamy way to live vicariously through others, this is not it either. Its not much of anything. I'm just waiting for the new Augusten Burroughs in May!!"
5,Good Yoga!,"These Dvds are really complete. They are perfect for yoga beginners because everything is well explained. What I liked a lot about these Dvds is that they are long, not only half an hour like some exercise dvds. They last from 1h30 to 2 hours so you really get to know yoga well. Geri made me discover yoga and I love it!I recommend these dvds to everyone who wants to do yoga!"
3,"Down low, quality that is","This cd is great for remembering the high school dances, and is fun to play at parties with your friends, but it ends there."
3,The Lives of the Saints,"As I read the author's account of Superman Churchill, passing lightly over Churchillean stumbles such as putting Britain on the gold standard, Gallipoli, holding badly needed troops in northern Norway, etc., I realized I was reading hagiography and not history. The abhorrence of unpleasant stuff extends to Hitler. It's hard to believe that anyone could write a book about the dictator and never even mention the Holocaust, but Strawson did, without explanation or apology. I'm surprised he didn't omit World War II."
4,Very Insightful----,"This is a very insightful book, it gives you so much more than you knew was going on behind the scenes and in some cases right in Roosevelt's mind and way of thinking! Bravo Bechloss, I think you hit it right on the head!"
1,Don't waste your time!,I purchased this from Wal-Mart yesterday. The wires snapped before making it through 15 strawberries. I wish I could give it negative stars!
4,Very pleasant surprise,"I bought this CD on a whim. The thought of a John Cage ""prepared accordian"" was in my head. The pieces that Stefan plays are wistful, dreamy Japanese-inspired tunes. A sense a well-being and ""rightness"" is created where I was expecting near-cacophony and edgyness. The accordian is exactly right for the music. The tonalities of oriental flute with the chordal depth of accordian are striking and thought-provoking in the very best sense.Of course, if your religion forbids listening to accordians, you have to pass this one up."
4,Great straightedge punk,"This is a great CD... if you are into the whole Straightedge punk scene go for this album. Contrary to Amazon's belief, it is not live. It does have a few live tracks but is mostly studio. Favorite song is ""Trust."" Great punk with a great message. 4 out of 5 'cause some of the songs sound almost alike. Still well worth the price!"
2,"Will NOT actually help you ""zoom zoom zoom"" to the Moon","As I found out too late, this is NOT actually a flight manual for the T51C Apollo Guidance Control And Docking Computer. It's just a *^&$%@! kids book. Would not buy again."
2,looks are deceiving,"THis book looks great at a quick glance, a more thorough read leaves you wanting. It does not attempt to rate locations, and is basically a quick blurb on all the bigger cities in the US. Yawn."
2,Painful,"I bought this ring because it came in sizes unlike the other bottle opener rings. It fits perfectly and is comfortable to wear, but when I try to open a bottle with it, it digs into my finger and leaves a bruise before it even opens the bottle. I'm a bartender, and I was hoping this would be helpful for my job. If you take the ring off and use it while it's not on your finger it does the job ok, but it's not quick and efficient like I'd hoped."
4,"Fun and useful, but uncomfortable","I love the concept of a ring that opens bottles! It's useful at parties, but it doesn't work well in combination with more stylish rings. The bridge design is too simple and the metal edges can be bothersome, but it sure is useful!"
2,Not at his best,"I wanted to really like it. I tried to like it more, but it dragged from the first page. I am surprised I finished it. Kellerman did a good job making Milo an enjoyable character, and I think he took the front seat from Alex in this book. The characters were the reason for the three stars I thought about giving. The book was not what I would look for in a book."
1,yawn!,"I'm actually not sure what happened in a lot of this book. I lost track halfway through, but read the rest because I like to finish things. Too many characters, no clue how they're all connected, too convoluted.. don't bother."
2,The Murder Book,Convoluted story. Hard to follow. Boring. Implausible.Ponderous.No more Kellerman for me.
3,"Sensationalist, desperate","These episodes seem a bit desperate to me, they don't have the focus and strong stories that the ones half their length in the first 2 seasons have. What do writers, celebrities etc do when they are getting stale? Sensationalism.I loved the ""conspiracy"" briefs we got with the general, holyman, etc. where are those?(about half way through s3 so far). They elevated the humor of this series a lot by portraying these idiot celebrities to the role of to be feared world leaders. This season just shows typical rock band stuff with no enemies on the scale of the conspiracy group. These are much less brutal as well. Where's the extremism that made this series so good?Where are the awesomely over the top concert performances?It's too bad, this series seems to be going the way of SouthPark, I have not watched that show in years it got so desperate. Thanks but I'll stick to season 1/2 and Venture Bros. This is just for those who are die hard fans no matter what."
4,"Christianity, morality, hope and crisis....","When I heard about this book the title was so appealing and, adding the credibility of the author, I couldn't wait for the delivery of the book.The topic is so broad and so relevant that you are full of expectations for this book.The book is great in identifying the crisis and at a certain level pointing out the root cause of this crisis.A lot could be said about the topic. The crisis of our society and our culture is evident, this is reflected in the life style of the majority of the people, lack of moral values, lack of integrity and self respect and other pulverizing factors.The book is a short read and not deeply elaborated. Unfortunately the crisis will get deeper and deeper as the lack of faith keeps increasing and values that ""threaten"" the existence of God keep becoming an acceptable norm.I would recommend the book and glad that I bought it, but would have been happy to read more about."
3,"""The Sopranos"" New Songbird","Many fans may know Jamie-Lynn from her role on the HBO hit series ""The Sopranos"", as Meadow Soprano. Her voice is also recognizable as she has sung the Diana Ross disco classic ""I'm Coming Out"" for a recent bluejeans ad campaign. On her album debut, Ms. Sigler takes one part Britney and one part J.Lo, and mixes them together for an okay pop record. Far from spectacular, 20 year-old Sigler's material could easily be performed by an artist 5 years her junior. She does take a bit of writing credit on some of the better tracks - ""Bada Bing"", ""Pressure"", and ""Come With Me"" - which do have some hit potential, along with the should be smash which is the debut single ""Cry Baby"". ""Cry Baby"" is definitely the album's very best track, and should she become a hit, it will be because of this tune. All in all, a very nice, if extremely common place, pop record for the young actress and singer."
1,I love the book-hate the movie!!!!!,"I am almost done watching the movie version of one of my favorite Linda Howard books ""Loving Evangeline."" How could Linda Howard allow her book to be changed almost 100 percent into this piece of trite? Robert and Evie should be good looking. Robert Cannon is portrayed by a middle aged actor with a paunch and graying balding hair. Evie is sexless as portrayed by the actress. Other than his suspecting her of selling his companies software there is nothing else remnicent of the plot.I am giving this DVD away to someone when I finish it. It stinks. I recommend the book to all for a great love story though."
1,Only if you have the Zetec engine,"I bought this manual for my 05' Focus ZX5 with a Duratec engine. Unfortunately, the Duratec engine gets very poor coverage in this manual. It's almost like they added it as an afterthought just before going to press. Consider buying this manual only if you have the Zetec engine!"
2,doesn' work for 2001 focus,"many things were out of place. for example the micro cabin filter, the DPFE sensor were both at the wrong places in the book"
4,Just What I Ordered,I ordered this for my nephew. He seems to like it and said it is doing the job he needed it for. It has made it through its first season.
3,Deserves to be revised and brought back into print.,"The ethical and intellectual struggle against the American practice of routine infant circumcision began with Wallerstein's 1980 book, whose viewpoint is that of a scientifically educated male. The next chapter in this struggle was Romberg's book, whose viewpoint is that of a mother of 6 children and a childbirth educator. During the 1980s, Romberg, Wallerstein, and Milos kept the lonely faith, paving the way for the growing awareness since 1990 that RIC is wrong. Mothers are effective critics of RIC, because they are free of personal bitterness, and because they are more likely to retain their common sense and good nature. Romberg's book is a fine case in point."
2,limitted range and some droped connections,"Ok. now for your average card you should at least be able to have a good signal and connectivity when the router is on the ground floor and you are one floor away in a average home. That was not the case with this card. I have two other USB wireless connectors on other computers that seem to be fine but this card frequently dropped the signal and had only at a poor signal at best no matter what I did. The drivers seemed to be somewhat flakey at best and while they did work, there were times when the card was not recognized at all. Strange, I know....So the best I can say is this card has some serious range short commings and don't expect it to perform well beyond that range."
1,Don't buy,"This wireless adapter is a piece of junk. Hawking Technologies shipped it with the wrong driver, as stated on their website:""HWP54G OR HWC54G IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY - WRONG DRIVER""Who does it affect?""Customers who have purchased a HWC54G Wireless-G CardBus Card or a HWP54G Wireless-G PCI card from 4/1/2005 to the present.""And when you go to download an ""updated"" driver, lo and behold it's the same driver that they're claiming doesn't work.Purchase this product to your supreme frustration and disappointment."
4,Just toss the CD it comes with and download the updated,"Look, I got this card for 10 bucks after rebates. I had to use a 60 dollar linksys usb network card to use the internet to get the updated driver but once I got through that hassle it worked fine. 10 bucks, it's really hard to beat that price."
3,Johnny Cash TV Show CD,"I must say that I was disappointed with the CD. The DVD version of this had more music and I guess that's what I was expecting. I am also curious why there was not multiple CDs and DVDs of this program. The suggestion on the publicity was that this was so groundbreaking and earthshaking. If so, (and I believe that it was) it is disappointing that more music was not featured. --Pastor Switz"
3,The Johnny Cash TV Show,"A cute DVD of Johnny cash music and artists that he supported. A bit cheesy, but it was in accordance with the time."
4,My Review,"Though I have always liked Johnny Cash, the recent movie about him sparked my reinterest in him. The DVD of his shows brings back many happy memories, not only of him, but of the guests on his shows."
1,As seen on PBS?,"There is no indication until you buy it, that this is one of those PBS specials that you can watch (and record) for free on PBS. Once you buy it you see a sticker on the shrink-wrap, ""As seen on PBS."" Deceptive advertising in my opinion. This is NOT just the Johnny Cash TV Show. It is a documentary about the 60's - anti-war protests, hippies, etc. So if you're looking for Country Music, well, yes, it's there, but you also get a lot of propaganda. Oh well, caveat emptor I guess.The Johnny Cash Show: The Best of Johnny Cash 1969-1971"
3,Poulenc Gloria Robert Shaw Chorale,"I bought this because I couldn't find the LP I thought I had. This is a newer recording, and I found the tempi faster than on the earlier recording. I liked the earlier recording better--and now, wouldn't you know it, I have found it!Poulenc: Gloria; Concerto for Organ; Stravinsky: Symphony of Psalms"
3,"I'm a dude, therefore I really don't have any interest in barbie...","Frankly, I bought this for a friend's birthday, and even though it's a nice doll, the one disappointment was that the year of the doll is not expressed in the description. this ""birthday Barbie"" came out sometime around 2001 if I remember right, so if you're going to be particular to find the barbie of the year your girl was born, be sure to do some research first.as for this doll being ""fun,"" I wouldn't know....this is one meant to be a keepsake.educational value...sexist and it promotes unattainable goals regarding beauty expectations, loldurability...it's a plastic doll.overall rating...."
2,"Just ok service,",I finally received the H.B. barbie doll. I got it for my sister's 70th birthday. Her name is Barbi and I periodically get her one for her birthday. This was the year to get her a special one. I found this oneonline and when I received it today the outside box was in great condition but the box that barbie is in was smashed a little and the price on the front said 19.99. Not that bad except the fact I paid 35.00 for it. They charged me 10.00 to post it to me and the stamp said 6.85.So I paid 45.00. If you add 19.99 and 6.85 rounded off is 27. I understand wanting to make a little on it ofcourse. But you nearly got double. Even 3 bucks on the postage of all things. Can't explain thatexcept stealing. So for the product inside the box it looks ok but thehair is different than the one they showed in the picture. I know who I won't be dealing with in the future. Debbie
4,Great book,"I choose this rating because this book created great interest, form beginning to end. I each character in this book the story was told in great form. I would tell everyone that enjoys a good book about Dutch!"
4,VERY GOOD READ,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. BUT IT REALLY GOT GOOD TOWARDS THE END. THE 2ND BOOK OF THIS SERIES IS THE BEST SO FAR
5,DUTCH,"YO THIS BOOK AINT NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. I HAVE READ IT TWICE ALREADY AND I AM TELLING YOU THAT IT IS THAT GOOD, THE CHARACTERS JUMP RIGHT OUT AT YOU LIKE A MOVIE AND IF YOU FROM THE HOOD LIKE ME YOU CAN RELATE. THIS BOOK GETS 5 STARS FOR BEING REAL GANGSTA AND DONT FORGET ABOUT MY MAN CRAZE HE IS JUST AS REAL GET THIS BOOK AND ALSO DUTCH II: ANGEL'S REVENGE CAUSE SHE GETS GULLY TOO."
3,Not Bad,This book was better than True To The Game. Although I don' know how much weight that holds because I hated True To The Game.
1,A Waste Of Time,"My sister loves Teri Woods books but i can't stand them. They make no sense. I order Dutch I &II back in febuary and normally i can read a book in one day if its okay or in a couple of hours if it is really good. This book took me a whole week because i could not stand the plot of the book. The plot is so far-fetched that when i finally finished the book, i was so upset that i refuse to read part 2. My sister says that the part 3 is the best but i would never know cause im not going waste my time."
5,Amazing,"A ""must have"" book for young neurosurgeons. This brandnew edition surprisingly defines basics of neurosurgery in detail and makes it a good start point for residents."
2,Nice to look at...poor quality control,"First, my daughter loved this item, but the build quality left much to be desired. If it weren't for the fact that she pleaded with me not to replace it, I would have sent this back to get a new one. Quality control is lacking - there was a defect in the finish (small piece of applique stuck to the front that I can't pull off/remove) and the top clasp came off (pressed into the lid with 'teeth') after a few days."
3,ok,"held up ok to my 3 yr old, nothing lasts forever I guess. Cute little ballerina that will get lost in a matter of time."
5,Great tunes for kids and adults,"This CD helped my kid spell ""biodegradable"" at an early age. The music is well done and not cloying as some children's music can be. These songs will go over especially well with bio geeks. Highly recommended!"
2,Words can not express,"I was looking forward to reading this book because the book seemed so interesting. I thought it would be a great ""halloween"" read. But boy oh boy was I wrong. It is very clear that this is the first book that this author has ever written. Not to mention it was riddled with a lot of errors, mainly in plot development. I can honestly say that I will not be recommending this book to anyone else any time soon."
1,Bad on so many levels,"I can only assume that the people that rate this book so highly either know the author or don't know what constitutes a well written story. This book seems like it was written by a junior high student for an english halloween assignment. The characters are completely under developed, the story jumps around and has several huge wholes in it and the whole thing just seems like you should top reading within the first ten pages. If I knew the author I would let him know that he now owes me money and an apology for wasting a couple of hours of my life."
1,someone lied on this book,This book was not as good as people was putting out there. The title did nothing for the book. I was not scared like they said I would be the book actually was not good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,good but.. jack...,you need to buy female to female 15pin jack.. this device has male jack for input
5,A Brilliant Collection of Moving Stories!,"Judy Doenges is a masterful writer! Her work is filled with emotion and very convincing. I especially like the story ""MIB""--it is one of the most poignant stories I have ever read. ""What She Left Me"" is a wonderful book--richly detailed and highly intelligent. It definitely deserves its rave review in the New York Times!"
2,It could have been a good book...,"The right person could have taken this theme and written a really valuable and useful book. Legault's attempt is a poorly organized mish-mash tainted by his own biases. Someone on the political left could have written a book with the same flaws and with mirror image biases and blind spots. And it would have been just as bad.Legault makes the case for critical thinking and this is good, but then he shows himself to be blinded by his ideology."
1,No critical thinking in Think!,"This book purports to explain why we need to depend more on critical thinking and analysis, but tries to do so without using any critical thinking. Most of LeGault's arguments are unsupported by any kind of evidence except for anecdotes. The author does his best to disprove his thesis with his own writing. Unbelievable!"
1,Disappointment,"As others stated, I too had hopes for a balanced discussion of the book's premise. Instead of finding the critical thinking mentioned, there were old arguments about culture wars. For a more thoughtful discussion of culture wars, see the February Atlantic article by E.J. Dionne, Jr. called, ""Why the Culture War Is the Wrong War""."
2,dichotomy in cardboard,"i looked forward to this book, but someone else should have written it. the author, the longer the book is read, disproves his own theory. he begins to write emotionally, taking potshots at everything from michael moore to global warming theories to the use of ritalin to psychologists in california, without the slightest evidence of critcal thinking. he states the obvious, and groups an entire people, such as the greeks, romans, americans, etc. as critical thinkers or not. actually the book, to me at least, would discourage logic. if this guy is what critical thinking produces, you can have it. it is a jumbled mess. a smart guy with a thesaurus, does not produce clear thinking. trying to separate logic from emotion is a fool's errand. it ignores humanity, which is what really separates us from the beasts. i guess i am trying to say is that this book, contains little logic. in fact, the whole premise is illogical."
5,Get greasy but stay clean,"From the opening Greasy Kid Stuff theme song to the closing Yo La Tengo version of My Little Corner of the World, Songs From Inside The Radio opens up a whole world of really good, fun music to enjoy with your kids. It is rockingly reminiscent of the great kids' music era ushered in by Peter Seger and Woody Guthrie. Hockey Monkey motivated my 8 yr. old son to pick up a guitar to learn to play and sing along. Ants in My Pants is hysterically funny to my 5 yr old. Chicken Impossible really gets the whole family listening. Them Bones is, of course, classic in the kids' music genre. That's Where the Plaque Is, has always been a tooth-brushing family favorite. This CD is a wonderful, fun way to bring really great music into your child's world and keep the doors open for communication, You Can Make a Difference if You Try, Try, Try."
5,"lengthy title, EXCELLENT recipes","This is my kind of book--amusing anecdotes from an offbeat mind splashed with a variety of tasty recipes. Al Sicherman is an admitted chocoholic ( and food columnist) so the dessert recipes are GOOOOOOD! This is a collection of his diversely-themed columns, so you can find ""mom-style"" food (my husband has adopted the chicken and dumpling recipe as his own) just pages away from the junk-food clones. If you prefer your cookbooks traditional, divided by course and teamed with impossibly perfect pictures (whose food ever looks like that! ) you will be disappointed and quickly frustrated. If, however, you believe food is fun, should taste good and hold no pretensions then beg, borrow or buy this book. Look for Al's column in your local paper and enjoy the read!"
5,Perfect!,"I love this. It looks great on my bracelet. I have received quite a few compliments on my bracelet, and people really seem to like this charm in particular."
5,Works well on windows 7,I am a software developer and some of my application still uses the parallel port for printing... So I try these STARTECh PCI Parallel ports cardfor my printing.. it work well for Win xp and Windows 7 . However when installing the card in windows 7 .. you will have to remove the default Printer Port from the Device Manager and reset this PCI Parallel Port to LPT1because the default installed setting is LPT3. A very stable and reliable product.
4,Parallel port,Perfect adapter for newer windows 7. If you need to adapt an old windows program for newer software this adapter works the best.
3,just as described,The book itself was more basic than I had hoped. The description and quality of the book was just as described by the seller. Shipping was rapid.
5,Awesome!,"Awesome CD's- brings me back! Make sure to get the accompanying book Hollywood Rocks. There is another book about a lot of these bands- The Sunset Strip Diaries by Amy Asbury, makes a good paring."
1,Buyer beware,"The most important thing to know about this album is that it may not be what you are looking for.Since no picture was provided, I thought I was getting a CD of the album originally cut and released in the late '70s (with the picture of the iconic mansion in blue light).I got something else, that I have not yet opened. It may be great, but I'm not going to open it until I'm done being irritated with the seller, who did not bother to post a picture or list the titles of the tunes so that the buyer knows they have ordered what they wanted."
5,Works Good,Basic cable that works good and does what it says.Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did.
2,Decent but severely overpriced,"I used this book for a 300 level undergraduate probability course. I'm glad it's over now!Pros:1) The book is set up in a straightforward way, running from counting techniques to probability and then statistics.2) The examples were pretty helpful.Cons:1)PRICE!!!!!!!! Every college student knows that textbooks are overpriced these days. The companies seem to justify this by adding links to related web content, putting color photos/graphics on every page, etc. This book has none of this! It's all black and white! All the graphs look like they were done on an Apple II! Hey, I like pictures as much as the next guy, but but a 6 year old edition of 600 black text pages is not worth $100!!!!!!2)No solution manual--for some of the more complicated problems, you need the solution manual, not just a numerical answer at the back of the book.Verdict:If you have to buy this, but it used! Stand up to textbook price-gouging!"
3,"Solid, But Too Much Like Its Counterpart","Solid. Meticulously Organized. Developmentally Approrpriate.I use these words to describe this book, but its activities mirror Feldeman's other book (TRANSITION TIME!) too closely to invest in both books.Please get either book by Feldeman. You don't need both unless you want more of excellence. I don't think you can ever get enough transition knowledge."
1,An overall uninspired dance mix...,"The NRG level just isn't consistent on this mix. Starts off really boring. The first track is way too long and repetitive. Same for track 2. Track 3 is more of the same, with a bit of sexy vocal to spice things up a bit. Track 4 is vocal disco house, not so bad. Track 5 is the new mix of Loleatta's ""Stand Up"", but the Johnny Vicious mix from 1994 is still ten times better. Track 6 puts some diva vocal over the riff from Bad Yard Club's ""In Da Ghetto,"" and it's pretty hot. Track 7 is a thumpin instrumental, 8 is boring and repetitive. Track 9 brings back more intense vocal, 10 and 11 go back to boring, and 12 ends off with some boring vocal. Track times are:1. can I hear the drum (8:03)2. it's gotta be (5:26)3. set your body free (5:29)4. drama (6:29)5. stand up (6:37)6. music's gotta jumpin (6:14)7. on the drum (5:57)8. psycho (4:57)9. I feel love (4:42)10. let there be light (6:42)11. emperor (5:42)12. thru (5:36)"
5,compelling author,i studied with arthur j. dyck at harvard. he has maintained a compelling position for years in this important realm.father michael pacellawilliamsburg virginia
5,No more unglued for me,"I loved this book! Lisa TerKeurst is amazing at getting to the heart of what women are feeling. I could identify with her personal stories and insight into why we come ""unglued"". The Biblical passages to correlate were especially beneficial and I found myself taking notes thru the whole book."
4,Tonia B,"This is an incredible book. Reading Lysa's work is always like having a coffee date with your smartest, kindest, wisest girlfriend. She gives us the truth of her own struggles so we can know we're not alone and grow together in beautiful ways. Gentle, thoughtful instruction that is always witty, fun, and honest. Like Made to Crave, your husband will tell you it's a girl's book - and then you'll find he's swiped it for himself. Read it, and get permission to make imperfect progress on a path toward a more spirit-led life."
3,Its ok,"Our Bible study group chose this book based on the reviews and exerpts. To be honest, we dropped it halfway through. It was entertaining, but lacked depth and really offered us no opportunity for study. I would recommend it as a personal read that is mediocre, but the DVD series, the study guide and the book are repetitive and very common sense based."
5,Another life changer,This book really puts your emotions in perspective. She gives you tools and ways to overcome and deal with out of control emotions. Must read and even better when you apply it to your life.
5,Great Read!,I have read several of Lysa TerKeurst's books. This one is by far my favorite. I love how she is real and tells you how to handle yourself in certain situations with scripture in mind. My favorite part is how she shares that we cannot control the events that happen to us everyday but we CAN control how we react to them. Something I definitely took away from this book. Great read on how to evaluate each situation and how to go about handling them with dignity and grace but sometimes not always! I recommend this book to everyone!
5,Great book!!,Wow! First book I have read that is truly relatable to the everyday woman. She doesn't seem to have all the answers and is very truthful about herself. A non follower of Christ could easily relate to this book.
1,"Highly offensive and sexist - remove ""like most women"" statement","The blurb for this book reads: ""Lysa TerKeurst admits that she, like most women, has experiences where others bump into her happy and she comes emotionally unglued"". I'm a woman and I don't identify in the least with the author's histrionics. I'm really offended by the suggestion that becoming ""unglued"" by other people's happiness is typical of ""most women"". Please remove the statement ""like most women""."
4,Written from the heart,In his debut novel Chuck Logan writes anything but the atypical thriller. In creating his characters and location it is very obvious that he is writing about what he knows and drawing from personal experiences. This book is a touch harder and gritier than most thrillers on the market and therin lies its strength. Combining this with a great command of the language and some of the most original descriptions I have ever read make this a powerful and captivating read. The characters act real and the twists and turns of the plot keep the action moving. Recommended if you are looking for something harsher and more moving than your average thriller.
5,Navy stories so outlandish and funny they must be true,"Better make sure your chair has arms, otherwise you'll fall off laughing so hard. Check in with the screwball Navy populated by Lt. Cmdr. Curley Cue, Lt.(jg) Willy Wigglesworth, Adm. Windy Day, Adm. Bugler Bates and the rest to see how life must really be on an aircraft carrier. Written in the 1960s, Gallery's stories still ring true. No matter how technologically advanced today's Navy becomes, its still all about ships and men. And both have their foibles. Gallery exposes them all in this funny book. Don't stop with this one. Write the publisher and ask it to reprint all of Gallery's books. I am still missing a few from my collection."
5,Really a good job overall.,Very happy with everything - Quality and service. My kind of company. Everyone should do job like this.
4,Very Nice,"Not being unfamiliar with the corruption so heavily pertinent in our so called ""War on Drugs"" it was a pleasant surprise to find new things in this book that I didn't know before. I do disagree with what they feel an ""adict"" is, but that doesn't change that this is a very telling and touching little story. I ordered it so I could lend it to friends who are really just too damn lazy to read a full book and I figured if pictures were involved they just might find it o.k, I recommend it to anyone in 6th grade and above with any amount of knowledge on the topic."
5,What a Treasure,You will not be dissapointed to invest a little bit of money and getting such an excellent Systematic Theology book. This book is also pratical and full of illustrations. Most assuredly not boring. Packed with good nuggets of Bible data and truths.
4,Five stars for anything with Kress,"Barns playing is immature on this disk by that I mean down right corny but he did get better over the next few decades and even did a side that is on my top ten guitar albums of all time. That is with Bucky Pizzarelli a live duo set from a double album with the great Chuck Wayne,Tiny Grimes, and other people whose performances on the lp are best forgotten."
3,Sure to provoke discussion.,"Reminds us once again that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom... Highly recommended for public, high school, and university libraries"
1,Death before Dishonor,"Sorry to say but this dvd is a bootleg. When i received my dvd and watched it on my dvd player. It was a show i seen on A & E i have on vhs, The title is John Joseph Gotti Jr."
1,Waste of money,"I bought the ebook version and it is a joke. Look up the word cat via ""book search"" and you end up with 30 or more locations of the word or start from content and you have to page through many pages before reaching the word cat. Paper version may be good but ebook sucks!"
2,Super Thesaurus?,"The content is good and it's easy to look up words, however this advantage is lost because the print is too small and the spine breaks immediately with normal use and the pages fall out. I'm not happy with this purchase."
2,"good generic reference, not enough variety","All in all useful, but not nearly enough variety in the thesaurus. Many of the alternate words given were basically the same vein as the original. Often If anything, most of the alternates given seemed to be a dumbed down version of the word you were using."
2,Not very good for modellers- No color pictures- couple of mistakes,"I chose this book as a reference for modelling. There are no color photos or plates. The only color is the cover. There are also a couple of mistakes in the book. The text might refer to markings that aren't even displayed. For example, on page 4 the text states ""The individual letter A is in white..."" when the example clearly shows a letter H...Does have a couple of black-and-white photos of cockpits, and a nice chart of Fighter Gruppen Pilot markings, but these can be found in other sources. Covers BF 109 (E,F,G, K) & 110; JU 87 & 88; ME 163, 262, & 210; FW 109 & 190; HE 111 & 219; DO17; AR234."
3,Not bad,"This version not too bad, haven't used it too much yet. I pretty much had to upgrade to this from Money 99 as I am running Vista 64bit operating system & it wouldn't allow installing of Money 99 on it. I have used 99 for years, very used to it. I am from New Zealand & the Money products are not sold here any more?!! which I knew & so that's why had to buy from Amazon. It also doesn't allow direct upgrading from older versions that are not US versions (ie my 99 version), but could export each account from Money 99 to a Quicken file, then import these files into Money 2004. Only problem was any transfers from one account to another, show up twice in each account which stuffs it up a bit. I just did a balancing entry to get the current balance right. I think the very latest versions may not import from Quicken, but not sure about that. See: [...] You can't export/import bill payments either by the way, but not a major."
3,microsoft money,"good product for simply keeping track of expenses, balancing checkbook, getting a good picture of where your money goes (who knew?)"
5,"Exciting action, thought-provoking message!","I use this video as a basis for instructing motivation, values, and goal setting. And the action shots are phenomenol! MJ turns basketball into a ballet..."
3,GOOD FOR YOUNG PLAYERS.,THIS IS ENJOYING AND I PASSED IT ON TO MY YOUNG PLAYERS. I THINK THAT'S WHO WOULD ENJOY THIS THE MOST. MJ TRIES TO GET A POINT ACROSS AND THE YOUNG PLAYERS SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM. ANY MJ FAN WOULD ENJOY THE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS.
4,Not in Black and White,Not sure what the previous review is about. The video is not black and white at all - apart from 5 seconds of still photography.Excellent video and still the best for rapid-fire highlights
3,"useful, some relief","I like that Hyland's is an all natural product and these tablets are great because they can dissolve in your mouth, so when I wake up in the middle of the night I don't have to get out of bed to take it. I used it over probably a six month period for mild insomnia; sometimes it helped ease me back into sleep; other times I did not notice much of a difference."
4,one of the best critical attempts of Poe's work.,"There have been more well known academic studies of Poe's work (such as Daniel Hoffman's "" Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe"") but this is one of the best ones and deserves to be better known. Poe is still one of America's most avant garde writers and as Gore Vidal wittily wrote ""the primal fount of American literature."" Ketterer's book is not a complete success (his analysis of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""Ligeia"" is flawed); however his insights into Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" ""The Black Cat,"" and ""The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,"" are excellent and never resort to pseudo-freudian criticism to explain the author's psyche. David Ketterer's book provides a firm understanding of Poe and his mysterious work. I recommend to all students or lovers of literature."
5,The best comic book I've ever read,"I'm from Korea and I've read lots of comic books but Inuyasha was so far THE BEST. I've read till volume 33 and it gets more and more exciting everytime! I read all of them in Korean and Japanesse but I've read one of them in English. The English version is kinda weird cuz they talk strangly. I think the japanese and korean version was better. In volume 16, Inuyasha will be turning into his demon form! And his tessaiga breaks but he gets it fixed again. Everyone HAS to read this, it's a great book!"
2,aftermarket carb,I am not happy with this carb at all. It does not have a fuel mixture adjustment screw and the little spring that holds the choke in position fell out when I took the carb out of the box. Cheap knockoff of original Generac. Don 't buy it!
5,This is such a wonderful film It really Outta Be Put On DVD,It has been many years since I've seen this film but it is by far one of the better ones. It is such a touching film really well written and a good message to it. It really out to be put out on DVD I think many would like it and benefit from this film. I for one would definitely buy if they released it onto DVD!!!!
1,A Horrible Look at University-Level Debating,"This movie attempts to portray the world of university level debate, and does a poor job at that. As a Parliamentary debater myself, I can assure you of this being an extremely poor interpritation. In the big final round before the Supreme Court for instance, the debaters use opinion as argumentation using brilliant lines as ""abortion is wrong because God says so"" and relaying a personal story about getting an abortion, all of which are totally irrelevant. Abortion is also pretty much not debated on any circuit because the arguements are cliche (much like this movie), and no one's opinion is changed. Even given the poor debate, the acting is miserable, and the storyline is dull and uninventive. I strongly suggest steering clear of ""Listen to Me"", unless you just want a good laugh at a poor attempt at film ;-)."
5,Probably the best book on eco living today,"I've been looking for a book to help me transform my old farm into an eco-friendly place to live for myself and my children. I bought the Organic Living book and was very disappointed....so I returned it and got Conscious Style.If you're thinking of buying a book on ""green"" living with STYLE, buy this. It's so useful...tips like ""put lemoons and ice down your garbage disposal...the ice sharens the blades and the lemon disinfects."" GREAT!"
4,Good guide.....,Good reference. I have a co-worker who is terrible about creating run on sentences that go on forever. This book has been quite helpful.
1,No recommendation,"The only thing about this book i found useful is the section about transaction codes and tables, but internet is a better tool. The main section is absolutely useless."
3,"Good for locating rides in the Boone, NC/Damascus, VA area","This book gives the locations of a number of mountain bike rides in both the North Carolina High Country and the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. The book is adequate, but you will probably need to buy maps of the areas that the book describes. This is not a problem, as the authors tell which maps are needed for each ride. The region that the book covers is very popular with people throughout the Southeastern US, for good reason: the scenery is unsurpassed, and the outdoor recreation opportunites are excellent!"
5,Clear and unbiased,"As a neurobiologist interested in the philosophy of free will I found this tremendously helpful. Kane is perhaps the world's leading exponent of libertarianism, but this book is not at all biased towards his own position. He gives an even-handed account of all the major positions with great clarity. He somehow manages to combine the precision of the analytical philosopher with the comprehensibility of the teacher."
4,What a beautiful Armoire.,"I'm very please with this armoire it was a bit smaller then the one I had but all in all it was just perfect for what jewerly I had to put into it..After being robbed not once but twice withing 2 months, I wanted something that would brighten up my room and with the beautiful lavender flowers draping across the front of it it did just that. The cream color blended well in my room and it looks just beautiful up against the wall."
4,Great inexpensive watch,Love the military time dial. I have several inexpensive Casios for everyday wear. Excellent.
3,Very Sharp Watch!,"I love the look of this watch. I needed $6.00 more for a free shipping offer and I picked this watch.Two things:This watch is much smaller in diameter than it looks on the Amazon pages.The entire watch is 35mm in diameter compared to 40-50mm in most watches.Second, the watch arrived with a dead battery. Was not working. I purchased a battery, installed it and it's working fine.Just my observations."
5,A lesson about trying something NEW,"I first saw this story read on Reading Rainbow when I was a child, and was so intrigued (as much as a child can be intrigued) by it that I had to go to my local library right away to check it out! Even years later, I appreciate the lessons that this book has to offer ... teaching children and their parents that trying something NEW can be rewarding. Going against tradition and discovering new things is an adventure for Gabrielle in this beautifully illustrated tale.I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than 6 years of age, because of its wordiness. But a young reader with a love for books would eat this right up!"
5,Cute,"Cute, soft and cuddly bear. We bought it to comfort our Granddaughter when she got her tonsils out. It was a nice surprise when she woke up from her surgery."
3,Pretty Nice for Plaster & Paint,"I like them. They look like old tarnished metal when they're actually made out of a polyresin, Alabastrite.Would rate them higher if they didn't arrive damaged. The female end is chipped. They were poorly packaged in a very thin styrofoam casing. I would guess the cost of shipping their weight is more than the price of the item, which is probably why the seller, Direct 4 Sale, won't replace them.I would buy them again if I saw them in a nearby gift shop. But will never attempt to buy anything like this on line again."
2,Not good for much.,"If I'd seen this book at the library or book store first, I would definitely not have bought it. About 1/2 the book has nothing to do with woodworking. And most of the pictures in the book have no plans, instructions, or material lists - just a picture of a finished item. If I'd paid full price for this book, it would be going back to Amazon immediately; it might anyway. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Most definitely not a book for a beginner."
5,great!,im glad i got it...it gives u new careers and everything...the best part is that its burnable. so buy it burn it and return it. its not legal but i feel its the companys fault for not making it unable to burn. and it works perfectly once burned.
1,Not a very good idea - the earlier one was better,"May I point out that I have an earlier edition of Career Creator, (version 3) that does exactly the same things?It modifies anything the Pro version can, AND I got it FREE, that's not a free trial, from a site, which I cannot include, I found through a search engine. With the Pro edition, you will probably be charged more for the fact that it is user-friendly. Version 3 comes complete with a full tutorial, and you can get editing within minutes, all still free.All in all, this may not be the best use of one's time, money and anticipation of it arriving, when downloading the 950kb WinZip file is a lot quicker and free."
3,Used in ED ADM class,"You are not buying this to sit up at night for a little bedtime reading. It is a college textbook about administration. However, the book is to the point and researched based about a broad spectrum of issues facing the principalship. It provides a background and starting point for discovery about issues ranging from finance, politics, public school law and the emergence of the leader's role. These are all topics students in ED ADM will deal with once they enter the world of adminstration."
3,had to modify,had to modify this mount with a hammer to get a decent fit to the trans but other than that it seems like its made OK not nearly as good as the oem mount
4,Worked Well,"After unboxing it, I had to put it in boiling water for a few minutes to get it to uncurl. After doing so, it has stayed flat and sticks well to the floor, even without using the included tape."
3,"Uneven and Dark, but with Great Moments","""Rabbit In Your Headlights"" is eerie, catchy, and pretty great. I like the ""Unkle Main Title Theme"" with Mike D., also. The rest of this is aggressive in a good way, but dark and gothic in an unhealthy (clinically depressed) way. I expected more."
1,unbelievably dull,This album is dull. It sounds like everything else out there. This is an excellent example of style beating out substance. What a piece of crap!
4,NOT NEXT LEVEL,"If you like 4AD dream pop this cd will not disapoint.this is a pop record. nothing too impressive. a nice listen. if you liked the sneaker pimps, and you don't really like to be challanged, this would be a nice cd to get.on the other hand this whole cd is a cheap attempt at making money. it has no street cred. no music cred. nothing really to get excited about. someone had pull to get all these celebrity appearances and decided to play it cool to get paid. i don't have a problem with that, but ""boring"" is not what i'm looking for.alsomike d is so bad it makes you wonder if it's on purpose. please tell me it's a joke."
4,Liked it.,"I do like them, though they are very thin with no extra protection on the inside. Good thing its weatherproof."
5,3:16 Said SO!,"if youre a wwf fan, and a steve austin fan then this is for you. it goes very in depth in his career spanning everything youd want to know about his up bringing to wcw and to wwe. also in the special features there is HILARIOUS footage of him doing the classic, WHAT?"
2,"Great Documentary, Terrible Match Selection","The documentary and promos are great, but the match selection is a near complete waste of 2 discs. I find it hard to believe that Mr. Austin picked out the matches himself. I understand that WrestleMania is the biggest show of the year and are the most memorable matches (which is quite arguable considering all the PPVs each year.) But surely Stone Cold knows that almost all of these matches here have already been released on multiple DVD sets and are complete crap thanks to the horrific blurring of the Attitude era logo (especially for Mania 15 and 17.)I would've hoped for more In Your House and Unforgiven type of matches rather than duplicates of the WrestleMania and SummerSlam matches that have been previously released on DVD. Diehard fans of Austin it's a must buy, everyone else the documentary is a rental or worth waiting for when it comes to WWE Classics on Demand in about 6 months. And the sidebar thing is another big minus for newer DVD sets."
3,Better than most,"One thing I can say about this software, having involved in the deaf community, it's more accurate than other software that I have used. Unfortunately the software is extremely buggy with sporadic crashes and unfortunate problems with logic. The search tool seems to have been written by an beginning programmer. Some signs are visually incorrect from their description (check out kitchen and notice the video shows him using the ""K"" sign, but the description says to use the flat hand. Some signs don't even match the video so use with caution. The links to the website don't work (they are old) and the support is non-existent. I suspect that ASL needs to really take off before people take the language software seriously. Also note that ASL has its own structure. You would never say I am going to buy a blue car. You would say something to the effect of ""Car blue me buy"". Use it as a reference but not as a teaching tool to learn ASL. That is best reserved for the classroom."
2,"good intention, bad implementation","It is true, as other reader attests, that the book has many an error. However, what I don't like about the book is that the author uses the Java API to illustrate all his examples. Yes, this might be easier than to come up with a new implementation, but, is definitely not a good learning tool. I want to know what's behind each implementation so that I can abstract it in my head and apply it to other examples and problems. But for example, how is,int[] blah = new int(50);Array.asList(blah)lgoing to teach me about turning an array into a linear list or even a string? Yeah Java has the facilities, but it's all behind the fog (API).One other issue I have is that the author spends way too much time testing the Java API (about two chapters). And further, even as the book progresses, he keeps calling Java's internal, built-in methods and interface.It's not a bad book for the price, but don't buy it as a substitute for a text book or even a main aid book."
5,2prt PCI Card for Lagacy PCs,Without a doubt one of the easiest card adds I've done - drivers are native to 98 & performs well within expectations. Highly recommend this device if interfacing with a legacy box.Product & Price are 'Outstanding'.
3,Improperly titled,The only game that fits the title is the 80's NFC Championship game. The other 2 games are snoozers. There's many other Cowboys/Redskins games that were better than those 2. Good quality on all games.
2,"A lot more meaningful game were played, with the exception of the 1982 championship this set comes up short","Not a skins fan but purchase it anyway, would have like if they would have added the 1983 contest I call it the ""No Danny"" game, but skin fans will enjoy."
1,item great for take that fan - but do NOT buy from Amazon,"After waiting for this item for four month, after Amazon sent me two emails urging me to cancel the item I finally cancelled it. Do NOT buy this item from Amazon, and if I were you I wouldn't believe what they say about these import DVDs - ""usually"" ships 4 weeks? Yeah I was that stupid to believe this."
2,wireless head phones,This product works well but the batteries only last for a few hours. Rechargeable batteries are a must.
1,they came apart the first day,They suck they came apart the first day the heal came off and the paint rubed offI will never buy cow boy boots from amazon again and will stop buying from amazon if this the way thing are going to be
5,Didn't want it to end!,"Great book, If you ever had a competitive bone in your body, you will love this book. A perspective on golf from an everyday guy like you and me."
4,trowel tool,This tool can greatly do the job for the professional person that is a carpenter or concrete mason.
4,mount works with Legend Cx,"Just to emphasize the other person's observations, do not use the new back that comes with the mount. Just use the belt-clip that screws into the rear of the device to clip into the mount.I do wish that the mount, however, could fit both standard and oversize bars.UPDATE: It does fit an oversize bar. Whoops! Also, the GPS does vibrate a bit over rough road. So I supplement the mount with a rubber band. The combination works well."
2,not a good idea,"it works great however it will not work for those garmins since they cannot take the vibrations, mine died after I mounted it on the bike"
1,Etrex Vista HCx Incompatability,Maybe I should have read the details a little closer.The back/mount for the GPS device provided does not fit.Apparently this back/mount does not fit devices with a memory card slot.Beware before purchasing..
1,Does not work with eTrex Venture Cx,I wish I read some of these reviews before I purchased. The battery lid does not fit on the my eTrex Venture Cx although it claims to be compatible. I've also heard it doesn't work with the Legend.
1,WARNING ***COVER DOES NOT FIT Cx SERIES***,"For Cx owners, if a different cover were supplied, it would be a good product. The Cx models are designed to hold the microSD card under the cover. The replacement back supplied with this product does not fit the unit. Garmin could have easily molded a back for this mount that would accomodate BOTH the newer and older versions of the Etrex line with a rubber gasket seal. When you purchase a Cx series GPS, there is a supplied add-on mounting clip for the cover that protrudes and catches items when carrying the GPS off the mount."
1,It doesn't fit HCx,"I just returned this item. It doesn't fit Etrex HCx. Now, looking for one that works I see they didn't change the description."
1,BAD DESING !!!,"Does not fit GPSs with mini sd card, nor bicyclebars greater than 2.5 cm diam, which means it does not fit any road bike whatsoever. BAD DO NOT BUY !"
4,Really handy device,"This device has proved very useful in taking my eTrex along for bike rides. It fits nicely on small diameter handlebars (not so well on expensive mountain bike handlebars which have a larger diameter, but that's why Garmin makes a larger mount). It doesn't slip when riding over rough terrain, and it holds the GPSr securely. If you have an eTrex with a memory card, you will have to use the bracket that came with your eTrex, the one-piece back that comes with this bracket won't fit. If that's the case, you will need to check the tightness of the screw fairly often.All in all, a nice product."
5,Great mount,Holds my etrex venture very securely. I use it on my mountain bike and the unit has stayed secure after catching air and after some nasty spills. Strong and solid.
3,"It works well, but it's not durable","I used this one on my mountain biking. My eTrex fits very well with this mount, but the mounts has broken on an accident during biking. It wasn't ugly accident, only light fall. But because this is only mount available for eTrex, I've bought another one. :P"
3,Includes 4 live PinkPop tracks.,This is the Dutch release of the single and doesn't include the 12+ min re-mix of 'come together' thats on the US version. But you get 4 live tracks from the PinkPop fest. Includes short 'shine a light + electric mainline' jam. 'home of the brave' and one other. Worth it for only the hardcore fan or if you don't already have the US version of 'come together'. Others should wait for the double-live CD late oct. Studio tracks were re-recorded at Abbey Road studios and aren't too exciting. 'come together' was made radio friendly.
5,Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion,I really loved this game and all the other Conquerors gamesAlas they are all gone - what a shameI understand they are now available but you need lotsa $$$ to go through the game.If you do not pay for all the little extras you cannot win the game - too bad!
5,Review of Startech Ide4044 2.5in To 3.5in Ide Harddrive Cable Adapt,"As part of my regular duties at work, I am often required to back up hard drives from one to another and to make back up tapes of the contents of these drives. The drives from laptops are often a problem since they are not the standard 3.5"" drives that I normally use. This product allows me to copy laptop drives to my back up drives and tapes with no problem. It is an excellent product in a very compact package."
5,It's truly a song that melts my heart when I listen to it.,This song is substantial and it goes with the Movies Armaegeddon very well! Good piece of lyrics and a touch of love.
1,Anything can top it.,"This is by far the worse aerosmith recording ever. Don't get me wrong i think aerosmith is the greatest band ever. But form the person who said that nothing can top better be a girl. Ever aerosmith song is better than this. If you wanna hear good aerosmith buy rocks or toys, pump, grip, 9 lives, greatest hits or somthing. but this is not the greatest aerosmith song. I saw them in concernt and was totally amazing. But when they played this song and it ruined the experience. The 12 year old girls sitting next to me started screaming. God i just wanted to kick them in the face for being so annoying ( And maybe kick S. Tyler in the face for doing this b/c the only reason he did this and got the rest of the band to do it is b/c his daughter was in the movie). but those dumb girls in the show , geez they probably didn't even hear for aerosmith until this dumb song came out. trust me save your money. go buy some of there albums...you'll be pleased."
1,Worst ever by Aerosmith,"I was so looking forward to hearing a new Aerosmith song, a song that was going to totally rock, and what did I get? A pop song. I think this song is a disgrace to all true Aerosmith fans who love the hard, sleazy riffs songs. Where are the guitars in this song? There aren't any that I can hear. What Aerosmith manage to do is to finaly get a number 1 by selling out, getting people to buy one of their songs who have never bought or even listened to Aerosmith in their life. The sad thing is that all Aerosmith fans will still buy every version of this record, even when it's not worthy of the shelf space. If you like Britney Spears I encourage you to buy this record."
5,Mukiwa,"I loved the book Mukiwa. I left Africa about the time the book began and had visited Rhodesia in 1974-76. I had great hope that it would soon have majority rule as Zimbabwe because it was so rich and modern and the white Africans loved it as much as the black Africans. Reading Mukiwa and Godwin's sequel, When the crocodile ate the sun, made me as sad as him about the demise which continues to this day. However his writing style, devotion to his country, and kind, pure emotions as he and his family experienced the destruction of his home and family are an inspiration to me."
2,The book was in promised condition but I had ordered for a present and it was not delived in time.,This book is an especially good read. Plus I learned a lot about growing up in Africa and the internal problems in Rhodesia before they gained independence. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,"This is the real Rhodesia,innocent,cruel & funny all at once",I grew up in Rhodesia at the same time as the author & have been able to relate on a one to one basis and have found myself often laughing at Peters wit in his writing as I kept finding close similarities to my growing up in Rhodesia. Even to our house servants being named Tickey & Sixpense. Anyone can read & enjoy this book . It shows the relationship between European & African during those pre Zimbabwe years. A good read
3,Few Surprises in Latest Elvis Collection,"Elvis Presley fans will find diminishing returns in yet another RCA box set. ""Close Up"" offers more outtakes from the 1950s and '60, but nothing revelatory except for the gospel classics. However, the previously unreleased 1972 concert is worth a listen, with memorable versions of ""Burning Love"" and ""How Great Thou Art."" Though a relatively good investment for under $20, it's not an essential purchase."
5,Walker and Ping Ping visit a market,"We've been waiting for their second adventure, and here it is, as facinating as the first. You and your children will love it. Makes you want to get on the plane with the kids and head for Hong Kong!"
2,Very short and few vocabulary words,"Maybe we're spoiled because we also bought Journeys to the East ""The river dragon King"" for our son but this video was not only short in time but didn't cover nearly enough vocabulary as the river dragon king.As Walker and PingPing walk around the market there are some many opportunities for teaching Mandarin but they speak in english most the time and translate a handful of words.I'm very dissapointed in this video. I highly recommend ""The river dragon king"" from Journeys to the east.OR"
2,Print nicely but it's not water resistant!,"This printable surface DVD-R runs better on your DVD players without reading errors and less heavy than a DVD with sticker label but those HP Vivera inks will fade if you drop a little water on it or somebody touch it with moisty hands. You can only get water-resistant prints on HP Advanced Photo Paper or some products offered WaterShield, AquaAce and AquaGuard DVD-Rs but if you want permanent labeling, I prefer Lightscribe."
4,It's like a good sex...,"This is a must-have book for couples and singles who are sexually active. I found this book very informative in a very direct way. It's like a having a sexual therapist right in front of you. The book shows each issue in alphabetical order so it's very easy to reach the information I need. At first I thought it's more like a reference book, but after reading more, I found this book very readable, lively, and full of, not just knowledge about sex, but also advice. It answers thousand questions that many people feel embarrassed to ask. This book is like a good sex, you'd better read it before having it."
4,One of the best comedies out there,"The commentary is real histerical, and the openingsfor eachsegment are real funny also. The comedians really are funny when youhear them against the cheesy movie segments."
1,This book is not for everyone,"This book I'm sure is good for some people but I know that most of my physics class including me dislike this book quite a bit. The concepts aren't explained very well and the chapters are very choppy. It is a difficult read, but I'm sure it's great for other people."
5,About the Book - From the Publisher,"Physics For Scientists and EngineersPaul A. TiplerFor nearly 25 years, Tipler's standard-setting textbook has been a favorite for the calculus-based introductory physics course. With this edition, the book makes a dramatic re-emergence, adding innovative pedagogy that eases the learning process without compromising the integrity of Tipler's presentation of the science.For instructor and student convenience, the Fourth Edition of Physics for Scientists and Engineers is available as three paperback volumes...Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics, 768 pages, 1-57259-491-8Vol. 2: Electricity and Magnetism, 544 pages, 1-57259-492-6Vol. 3: Modern Physics: Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, and The Structure of Matter, 304 pages, 1-57259-490-X...or in two hardcover versions:Regular Version (Chaps. 1-35 and 39): 0-7167-3821-XExtended Version (Chaps. 1-41): 0-7167-3822-8"
5,Very good textbooks,I am a physicist who hopes to go on to engineering in the future so these were perfect for me. They are very well written and cover a lot of material so I'm very happy with them.
2,Dumbed down edition,We have used the 3rd edition for several years and recently changed our course to reflect the 4th edition. The 3rd edition was a decent standard version for undergraduate physics with the standard problems contained in most texts (say 4 stars). The 4th edition has fallen into the recent widespread trend within physics education of dumbing down the curriculum to enhance results. Much of the content has been either relegated to an 'optional' section or removed altogether. In addition many of the more challenging questions in the 3rd edition are removed altogether. (Symmetry of large resistor networks for example). Instead of watering down the content more effort should be spent on improving pedagogy. The pictures are prettier.
2,PROFESSORS: this book is poorly written for you and your students,"My biggest peeve are the estimation problems. One problem asks about the weight of a dirty diaper... you get some that require you to estimate the speed of a ball being thrown. Is this a fast ball? A child throwing a ball? Should I estimate that the ball was being thrown at a zillion meters per millisecond? My point is that a lot of the questions seems lazy like they didn't want to solve the math themselves when they wrote it. I'm sure that's not actually the case, but it does seem like that. Their thought experiment questions are often poorly worded so you have multiple interpretations of the problem. Very few fun math problems. Many math problems are hard only because you aren't sure what they are asking, not because the math is difficult. The only thing it does do right is it's example problems are written very clearly. That's my two cents. Good luck with finding a decent book for your class."
3,It was wrong device for me,"CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION ...for future buyers. I bought this adapter for Garmin eTrex Vista Cx, but THIS NOT WORK WITH IT. The seller DON'T GIVE THIS WARNING WHEN OFFERS THE ITEM."
3,Contour Design Showcase Video is much better,"I did not like the iSkin Eclipse. I have a 30GB Video Ipod, black. the iSkin looked ugly and I didn't like the way the plastic protector fit into the rubber, it was too bulky. The contour design showcase video fit my 30G ipod perfectly. The control wheel is not protected but this doesn't bother me. the Showcase video protects my Ipod very well and is not bulky, and is very well made."
1,Zzzzzz.....,"Honestly, the BORINGIST book ive EVER read! When I bought this, I thought I was in for a fun mystery, but instead, it seems as though I picked up a sail-boat guide instead. ALL this book talks about is sail-boats and maps! SERIOUSLY! Thats pretty much ALL this whole thing is about! I FORCED myself to finish it, while somehow keeping my eyes open! Luckily, I only paid a quarter for it...I think I'll go back to Nancy Drew!"
1,wasted $9 on this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought it after reading the reviews but I am very disappointed with it.I couldn't go through even half of an apple with it. One should be very strong indeed to use it to cut through a whole apple. And it is too big to cut my favourite golden delicious apple. The apple was too small for the slicer..
1,Cheap Junk,"I have been through two of these in the last year. The spot welds that hold the cutters together broke on the last one and the plastic broke on the first one. Unfortunatly from what I have seen they all have the same problems. One thing to note both times I was slicing a granny smith apple which tend to be hard, but they are good for cookng. I want one with a warrenty next time."
4,worked great,I was skeptical at first to order this but now I have no doubts at all. This product worked great and I was able to start recording and capturing video from my sony camcorder
5,Good Product,One of the few plug and play products I bought that really was plug and play. I installed the card in a few minutes and the software worked the first time right out of the box. Nice product for both the beginner or if you know a little about video editing.
4,right book at the right time,"I needed to prepare for an MM interview, and this book helped me form a plan of attack for study. One of a kind, looking for a BW interview book as well."
5,good for learning,"If you're playing a small role in a large SAP project, this could be the guide to help you learn enough to take another job as an SAP consultant. Not an advanced guide, but good for getting started. Bit pricey, but worth it if it helps you get a good position."
