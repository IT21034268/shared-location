2,Don't bother with these.,"They are comfortable, and the cord is quite handy at 10ft. long. But the built in audio control switch does not work and after a couple of months of usage the audio in the right side went out."
4,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for, nice design, comfortable, low price and quality construction but with a few more money you can get a better sound, nice one by the price"
3,okay,I was expecting a better product from sony.Its about as good some buds I've bought. I was disappointed.Too bad m
4,Great Headphones,I use these headphones when i'm playing on the my casio 88 key keyboard and it's not so bad. The headphones could be more noise cancelling but i'm not one to complain.
2,These...,"Must i say i have owned many headphones and earphones and never in any day have i seen such a huge cord! The sound quality has noting to compare to my in ear skull candy 50/50, and they are way smaller! Also these headphones came damaged. Save your time and buy something else than this, i don't see how this has so many good ratings."
5,Speakers for my movies...,"I got these because the price was great $20 bucks for a nice head set.I wanted speakers that would be comfortable on my ears,and those little tiny bud things everyone wears are painful to my ears,so these were perfect,soft and smooth,the sound was amazing,and I can watch movies on my kindle/laptop/cell without having to hear everything else in the room.I highly recommend these."
3,Not Very Portable.,"I've always been a fan of ear bud headphones because they're a little more subtle than headphones. But after going through about twenty pairs of cheap earbuds this year, I finally decided to give headphones a try.The sound quality is impecable but what I didn't notice when I ordered them was that the cord is literally close to ten feet long. I primarily use headphones during travel so this was a HUGE drawback for me. I just took a couple of twist ties and bound up the extra cord but there's seriously no need for headphones as cheap as these (which are probably not going to be used by music producers where a 10' cord might be useful)."
2,Booo!!,"I ordered these headphones because my wife was tired of hearning me play PS3 games. I would have preferred a wifeless setup, but we are on a budget so I ordered these Sony headphones instead. They arrived and worked ""Ok"" but there defintely was some noticebale static when using the headphones. I didn't care too much at the time because, despite the static, the game audio came through the headphones and it didn't futher ""piss"" off the wife (she could fall asleep without interuption). Fast forward about 9 months and the headphones just gave out. Doesn't work anymore. Junk product. I didn't even give it heavy use...maybe 2x a month! Plug the headphones in now and dead silence. Doesn't matter if it's my notebook or TV. Dead. Garbage product."
1,Broke so fast!,"I don't know if it's just me, but mine broke within a month.I didn't even use it that much, and they stopped working..Also I figured the sound leaks and the quality isn't so great..I guess I can't expect so much from a 20dollar headphone.."
4,Awesome headphones at a price too good to be true,"These headphones are great. They're oversized and fit over the whole ear, which is the reason I bought them. For the price these headphones rock and it can't be beat. The sound quality is awesome, albeit not as loud as I would like, (I have to turn up the volume on my iPod to 75% to get decent sound. Is something wrong or is that how headphones are? I dunno) Aside from being a tad on the quiet side, these are awesome headphones. Fit snugly and comfortable, sound production is great (I'm no audiophile so I think its good), and you cant beat the price. You wont regret it."
3,pro and cons,i was highly disapionted when i got this product the sound modes that is featured with this product does not work with mine when i switch them over the two settings sound the samesecond reason i am disapointed is because the purpose of a headphone is so you can hear the music or audio and the people around you cant this headphone holds no sound in you can hear the sound blasting through the headphones from outsidesThe thing i like about this headphones are the wires it is really long giving me free space to move around in when im recoding a songand these headphones are very comfortable if you adjust t hem right
5,great product- perfect in my opinion.,"The sound is bold and loud. I like the design. I knew beforehand that the movie and music mode was a dud, so i didn't expect anything. Highly recommended product. Enjoy!"
3,pretty good product,"this headset is good enough to use but not that much more then that. the sound quality is lacking and whenever you adjust it it feels like its going to break on you. i rate this product a 3 becuase it is good if your just looking for a cheaper headset that works but not very well. I ended up just buying a x41 because the 150$ you spend on it is totally worth the crystal clear sound quality, the wireless ease of use, and the amazing 7.1 sound quality as well as the fact that any product plugged into the front of this device also will run off of either 5.1 or 7.1 sound depending on the age of the product."
3,Huge Headphones,"Bought these headphones because they fit over the ear, rather than on or in the ear. I wanted to use them while on an airplane, but they are so huge that I practically need another whole suitcase just to house them. They do not fold up, and the actual headphones are humongous. Also, I use them with a portable DVD player, and with the sound turned up all the way, I can barely hear anything. I would recommend these headphones for the comfort of long-term use (i.e. 2 hours) because they fit comfortably around your ear. But I would not recommend for use on an airplane or for other travel with them. Sound quality is decent given the low price."
1,Landfalls of Paradise Cruising Guide to the Pacific Islands,"If you plan on cruising the South Pacific, like we did, do NOT purchase this book. If you seek anchorage or clearance information from this book you will be truly disappointed. The information in this ""guide"" is very old and out dated. And, the book is extremely general in nature. I.e., it will be a waste of your time and money if you seek to use it as a cruising guide for the South Pacific. - Jason and Karen Trautz, S/V YOLO -"
3,Pretty stickers - but SKIMPY for $7.00,"I wish I had read the product description and reviews more closely before I ordered this book - very skimpy for the price! If my daughter didn't LOVE princesses so much, I would return it!"
3,Meh,"The unit isn't very impressive. I wouldn't really call it a swamp cooler. Sure, it evaporates air but unit is more in line with a humidifier than a ""cooler"".Like others have stated, this is not an AC unit, nor will it ""cool"" things off like you might want it to.I expect it's use may change as the seasons change but in the heat of the summer it won't cut the mustard.For $100 I could have picked up a more quiet fan and probably been happier but I'm not out too much.The timer function is nice. I can see running this in the winter to add some moisture to the house."
2,Just save the money for an air conditioner,"If I had it all to do over again I would just go ahead and buy a regular air conditioning unit. The cost for the unit compared to when it worked. When the air was most humid, this thing was nothing more than a fan. When I needed it most it let me down. Of course that's it's design, but it doesn't mean I have to like it."
2,"Great fan, not so cool","The fan on this unit is great, it's quiet, but I don't notice the water cooling. I'm in the dry arizona desert so I thought this would work. I usually just run it without water though. For the price, a normal fan would be a better deal."
1,a piece of crap,This is a piece of crap. Not cooling down anything. The air comes out of heat hot. it's just a simple useless fan
1,Do not waste your time and money buying this item,"I have a very small room and gets heated up quickly with evening sun.I thought this product will help but doesn't make any (absolutely nothing)difference.1. I tried putting lot of ice along with water in Water compartment2. Kept Ice pouches on top shelf and didn't make any difference3. Worst part is the room getting hotter (because of blower may be?) if we keep this unit ON for couple of hours.4. Lot of maintenance like putting water, Ice and what not.I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,Doesn't work,This didn't cool at all like a real swamp cooler. It would just make it humid not cool. So I put this into my greenhouse only to bring up the humidity . I bought a whole home swamp cooler and it works far better then this thing. With my whole home system I cool my home for $100 a month vs the $350 power bill I get when the AC is on. It's not that I was expecting this little unit to cool my whole house but I wanted it to cool a small 14 X 10 room and it did not . I think the reason being that this unit is not made to pull in outside dry air. So from the time you put this on humidity goes up and doesn't go anywhere meaning before you know it your bedrooms humidity is so high this cooler stops working leaving you with a hot sticky room. It might work fine for some one who works out side and wants a cooler breeze but that is about it .
2,Not good for my application,Doesn't work well for my application. Bought for an approximately 200sq/ft garage. The cooler is of little use in this size of room. May be good for smaller areas but not for what I need.
4,Good,"Works well if the room air needs a cooling ""boost"". Doesn't as well if the room is already warm. Then again, it is not an air conditioner.For the price, it works well and is as good as others on the market of the same type."
3,"Kinda like a fan, kinda not...","It blows cold enough air loaded with ice and water.Doesn't really keep the room cool, but cools it's 'swing zone' nicely.Nothin' special, you get what you pay for.Pretty quiet and it's better than a fan."
2,Only works in the sahara,"Evaporative coolers, also known as ""swamp coolers"" DO NOT WORK if there is any humidity in the air. Unless you live in a high desert, these devices can actually add to your hot sweaty misery by increasing the humidity in your house and possibly even warming it because of heat generated by the fan and pumps. Higher humidity can even cause mold and mildew problems. Remember if the air is saturated with humidity the water in this device can't evaporate and it can't cool the air.High desert = GreatAnywhere else = Don't bother"
4,Babylon hav na roots...,"This album comes from the most high, JAH Rastafari, to your ears for the low price of $6.99! Come and get down on these vibes from Clinton Fearon, one of the most influential reggae artist of the 22nd century. Long live Gladiators and the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah! One love"
5,great shoes,"These shoes are just what I was looking for, they are light and very comfortable. Shipping was fast and the product is great. I would definitely recommend them"
3,Sure beats Marion/Thornton!,"Understandable concepts. Challenging. On theother hand, ANYTHING beats the lame Marion/Thornton text which is lost in a sea ofmindlesss formalism."
2,Jerry Seinfeld's in this?,"If you want Jerry Seinfeld to make you laugh, watch reruns of ""Seinfeld"". If you want to see manic-depressive comedian Orny Adams' ego expand, then buy/rent this DVD. For some reason, I thought this would be a documentary about Jerry Seinfeld and there is a fleeting glimpse of him, but mostly you get Orny holding forth backstage, in cabs and on the sidewalks of New York. For this I paid good money?"
3,"Good movie, but that Orny guy ruined it!!!","Oh yeah, Seinfeld is great no doubt... I enjoyed him every minute, BUT that Orny guy is just not a comedian at all... He's pompous, rude and so-not-funny!! He thinks he's all that too and at one point, he pointed out the audience 'sucked'! Hmm... and he thinks he's a professional...Why did Seinfeld include him in the movie? That's questionable. My roommate said Orny definately is psychologically imablanced. Hey, maybe that's all part of his skit?!? Naaaaah!"
3,Not what you'd expect,This is not a comedy show. It is a hodgepodge of spliced videoclips about the industry and often the video is grainy.
4,Strange... Very Strange!,"Only 4 stars because there are times when there are depressing subjects, loneliness and sadness.The heroine suffered a mentally abusive childhood and becomes an unlikely investigator. Alvtegen weaves a bizarre story line that keeps you captivated for the entire book.Recommend for fellow readers!"
5,Darling Darling Julie!,"This is one of the best soundtracks ever, although it is packaged poorly. Julie's voice has never been better! ""Whistling In The Dark"" is so hauntingly beautiful, and the other songs are very memorable. Buy this CD before it goes out of print!"
3,It's Dr. Phil....nuff said,"The book reads like he speaks. I appreciate the directness of it, but I'm 3/4 of the way through the book and it's still all about ""me"". I'm sorry, but in this case despite what he advises it's not about me. He needs a workbook for ""So You Married a Sadistic Sarcastic Jerk"""
2,predictable,"I cant believe this book has as good reviews as it does. I found it boring and totally predictable. I had the ""killer"" fingered half way thru the book. It drug on and on."
3,More Romance than Suspense,"Ms. Hoag's transition from romance novels to crime/suspense novels is still a work in progress. The first 250 pages of this book read like a typical bodice-ripper, focusing on washboard stomachs and sexual yearnings than on the actual bayou murders occuring in the local parish.When Cry Wolf finally does get down to focusing on the murders, still with a tremendous romance bent, it's as if Hoag was working from some standard formula. Not only is it completely obvious who is committing the murders but the climax is almost painfully trite.If you really want to read a suspense novel with a strong and extremely interesting female protagonist, skip this and pick up something else, Mallory's Oracle for instance."
2,"Nice but,","We really liked this product very much. Examined the box, which was a total mess. The inner box, not the Amazon package. Started the installation. Put everything together and when it was up on the ceiling we found that the base plate was bent. Returned to Amazon for credit. The design was fine and exactly what we were looking for, but no more in stock so we moved on. If it's in stock I would certainly recommend it to you."
4,"Funny, hot , and Sexy","great movie the funniest part was probely the part called rough riders because trish, stacy, and terri were so funny. on the extras the matches are the pilgarm fasion show (torrie v.s. Dawn M.)hallowween match (torrie v.s. Dawn) Santas little helper match (trish, stacy, jakie v.s. victoria, ivory, and molly) Valentines day match (torrie v.s. dawn)then theres torrie v.s. nidia, trish v.s. jakie v.s. molly, terri v.s. stacy, Trish v.s. stacy, Trish v.s. Torrie, Chicago street fight Victoria v.s. Trish. Also torrie and dawn's hotel room footage, stacy as the statue of liberty and a thing where ivory shows a camera man how to use a whip. The last is lovely lita at an animal shelter to show you the job she did when she was hurt shes not in the movie though. I think litas was the the best, most heart thoughing and funny part on the extras but all and all the movie and extras are awsome. i hope this is helpful!? I wish chyna (joanie Laurer) was in the movie im here biggest fan."
3,3 stars for Bmg,"This is a great,great box(personal favourit),but there's one thing(few songs,I'd say)that's missing...So what's wrong here?Well,If you love the song ''Sylvia'' as much as I do,don't get to excited...It isn't there. It's beautiful and,may I say,much much better than the live vers of ''Suspicious Minds''(which you can find on ''Aloha'' cd)...''When I'm over you''- my god, I could not believe that they didn't put that...Not to mention songs like:''Never Ever''(great one,believe you me),''Bitter They Are Harder They Fall'', SPANISH EYES(can you believe it??!?!?)And What about ''If you love me ,Let me know'',that Elvis loved so much(I couldn't find a good version of this song) or ''If you don't come back''(If you love ''Aloha'' version of ''Fever'',you'd like this song even better...he's singing itsooo coool)...Great music,The Greatest performer ever...BUY IT10 STARS FOR THE STUFF!!!!!!"
2,Almost as bad as they say,"This dictionary is OK for a tourist who will use it to read a few store signs and order a beer, but it IS somewhat unreliable. Since there is so little else available, though, people will probably continue buying it. If you can wait until you get to Prague (or another big town), you'll find better and cheaper dictionaries there."
1,This dictionary is poor as far as content goes.,If you really want a great Czech-English Dictionary you will have to go to the Czech Republic. I found that this particular dictionary did not have many useful words and that some of the information was inaccurate. Over in the Czech Republic they have a great pocket-sized dictionary that they sell in all book stores. Those are the better ones.
1,Trite and boring with self-centered characters,"What a disappointment this book was after having enjoyed some of her other novels! The characters are dull and self-centered. Who cares what happens to them? I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. They haven't worked out isses from high school! What boring lives they have had!! The conversation between them is stilted and unreal. I want to tell them to grow up and move on!! But don't waste your time reading this book."
2,Blech!!!,"While I usually enojoy this author's writing, this book took me 3 weeks to finish. I found it especially tedious and the little segments where Agnes was writing about the Halifax episode were boring. I skipped over those parts, which turn up quite frequently in the book. I definitely say this was not one of her best books, but will read more of them in the future."
3,"I had to force myself to keep reading it, trusting the author...","Anita Shreve was once my favorite author. Her earliest works were phenomenal. Her last few have been boring and anti-climatic. A December Wedding was very boring and anti-climatic. The characers were unenjoyable and the plot was dull. The first half of the book just dragged on and on. I forced myself to keep reading since Anita Shreve is an awesome author, yet I was disappointed. It was a drab book with characters you don't really care about. This book has so many unheard of words that I literally felt like I needed my dictionary next to me while I read! As an avid reader and educated professional I was irritated with the overly ""fancy"" language and word choices. It was almost ridiculous! If you have read all of her books, you may think this is Okay. I wouldn't buy it."
5,If you can relate - this is an amazing book.,"This being my first Shreve book, I was pleasantly surprised. Offered on the pages of this book are issues that may raise the hackles of some readers, but remember that it is fiction. Shreve does an outstanding job developing characters who are real. There is no ""happy ending"" which, for me, was a happy ending in and of itself. True women's literature. I found it refreshing to read and have become a Shreve fan based on this book. Highly recommended if you can handle what may cause some to squirm. I'm reading ""The Weight of Water"" next."
2,Disappointed in Shreve,"I waited quite a long time to read this novel which I reserved at a local library. I was very disappointed and surprised because I had thoroughly enjoyed all of Shreve's previous novels. This novel was more complex than it needed to be....maybe because the main characters, best friends from high school didn't provide enough story. Shreve's constant reference to 9/11 seems out of place and the sub-story about the Halifax disaster was ponderous and I skipped most of that. I am hopeful this is a low point in Shreve's literary work and that we can expect another novel soon that is worthy of her previous work."
1,Book,This book was BORING!! I made it to the 5the chapter and stopped. The beginning focuses a lot on their high school/college days. Just plain boring.
1,A ho-hum wedding in december,"I have read other books by Anita Shreve, so I imagined I would like this one also. I have started and stopped it - but only got to page 57. I am still debating finishing it. I found the ""imaginary story"" very boring. It may get better but there is nothing there to hold my attention. I think she should stick to one plot."
3,Not Shreve's best,"I have read all Anita Shreve's books and enjoyed them all, some more than others. This is not her best. Three stars does not mean it's a bad book, however. It's better than a lot of what's in stores, but it falls short of her better stories. Friends from high school (though listening to their remembrances it sounds more like college) gather for the wedding of two classmates. The story, the characters (one is dying, one is widowed, one in an useasy marraige etc), even the setting are all standard stuff. There's nothing about any of it that makes it exciting or unusual. There is a lot made of a classmate who died senior year. I kept expecting a secret to be revealed about that event, a ""shocker"" or at least something memorable, but that wasn't the case. To me, the whole book was flat and without energy."
1,Terrible customer service from SF Planet!,"My husband ordered this through the SF Planet website (which will teach him not to order through Amazon!). Their website indicated that it would work for a 5th Generation 60GB Ipod Video. When he received it, the package indicated that it was for a 30GB Ipod Video. When he sent them an email, they responded by telling him to open it up and his Ipod would fit. It didn't and when he sent them an email asking for help, they never responded. A waste of money and terrible customer service. Don't order anything from SF Planet!"
3,Cups too shallow,"No my ears don't stick out: not even as much as most. I got tired of the computer style headphones that press a foam disk against your ear so I decided to buy a set of ""cans"" and chose these. The sound is fine, the price right, but the cans, or earcups, are too shallow: the foam over the speaker still presses against my ear uncomfortably. To me, the ring that goes around your ear should press against your head, leaving your ears untouched. That's why I can wear hearing protectors all day with no problem: they are designed for comfort! These are not. Also, their smallest size setting is just right for this 40 yr old male. If your head is smaller, you may need to wear a hat or two under these."
5,Clearing the picture,"It is the best book that describe the real situation of the world and the realtions between the big events in the world dispite it is old book, which gives it the credibility. Telling us who were behind the evil events and how they were established and what are their plans, what the achieved from it and what not yet, and how did they devoloped. So you can read the current international situation clearly and with no blackout."
5,"C Houston, Texas",Light raspberry scent. For me the first condition made hair soft and itwas tangle free.
1,There will be *no* updates for this guide,"Cryptic/NCSoft have issued the latest update as an e-guide, and have stated that they have decided against the binder update format. So it's pointless paying more for this than the usual cost of a strategy guide."
4,Caustic humour,"I 'm fond of the very caustic humour of V mCD : each sentence an uncontrollable laugh. The main character, a young woman detective, is engaging. In this book, there are two investigations about estate agency and notaries swindlings which intersect.There are a little bit too similar. But a great pleasure to read."
4,A memoir of discovery!,"In two words, it is irresistibly readable. I was immediately hooked by the author's ease of recapturing the process of the journey, and the vivid dialogue of the story's principal character. Not many of us are so bold as to move a cottage or follow a dream. The author has given us a highly understandable and dramatic account of one woman's commitment, struggle and passion for a dream. I'm personally inspired. This is a woman worth knowing. I highly recommend."
1,A wasted opportunity,"What a disappointment this record is! The sad part of it is that it has so much good material. The little zarzuela's music is charming and easy to listen to, but the voices kill it. The three principals are terribly wobbly. They're not su much old voices as worn voices. The arias a duets that follow the zarzuela are seldom recorded by themselves with the exception of ""No puede ser"" and ""Caballero del alto plumero"" and they'd have been a treasure to have had they been recorded with good soloists. Sometimes listening to to them is a real chore. I'd say that this record is only for those people who have to have every zarzuela record on CD that can be found on CD on the US."
3,Nice book,"I loved very much this book, it's well written and the illustrations are wonderful and it's a great way to show Paris to children."
4,Delightful little book!,"A cute story about brother and sister Simon and Adele making their way home from school. Simon looses something (hat, scarf, book) at each place the siblings stop on their way home (museums, parks, parades). The story is sweet and the pictures are charming. You can find each missing item in the pictures (great for visual children) and in the back of the book is some information on the various places the children stop (the book is set in Paris, so that adds another charming dynamic).While it's not an incredibly detailed story, it is fun and entirely worth the read.:)"
5,Perfect - so evocative and beautiful.,"Whether you've been to Paris or not, this book will make you homesick for the city. The detailed, crisp drawings are almost more important than the story. I could look at Adele and Simon for hours."
5,bike steel seat clamp,bike steel seat clamp arrived ahead of schedule was very low in price and easy to assemble. a very valuable asset.
3,Good book,Good book right from the start. It tied in great with the movie story line. Great start to the Boba Fett character
1,Get the right pans!,"If you have a new induction cooking unit, get the right pans. Don't try to adapt your old ones with one of these things. This one cracked in two in the first 10 minutes."
4,Gift Purchase,"I purchased this item as agift for my brother who has been getting into using cast iron cookware. He seems to enjoy the item and the multifunctional uses of it too. Trivet for a hot dish or meat rack in pan, whatever else you can think of."
4,"Good ""Keep Warm"" Trivet for a Wood Stove","Including the three tabs that stick out (about 1/4""), the trivet is ~8-3/8"" diameter (it would not fit in a pot with an inside diameter smaller than this). The three supports are ~3/8"" diameter bosses that hold the trivet ~1/8"" above the stove top (or pot bottom). The trivet is made of ~1/8"" thick cast iron, so its total height is ~1/4"".We bought two of these to use on our wood cook stove. When the stove is very hot, placing a pot on top of one of these helps keep the food from burning. This design has very little contact with the stove though, so--unlike a little ""cereal"" trivet rescued from an old McClary Charm wood stove--we can't use it to make cereal over a typical fire (does not let enough heat get to it). For this use, a little more stove contact would be nice. You need a really hot fire to actually cook on this. That said, this is very effective for keeping things warm on the stove without burning them."
3,Buy the LED one instead,"I accidentally ordered this one, and immediately returned it. It's not that it's fundamentally a bad product, but I intended on getting the LED otoscope. This one has an incandescent bulb, which not only drains batteries 10 times faster than an LED, but has a lifetime on the order of hours.For the technically minded, the LED otoscope appears to have a DC-DC boost converter, so it should still work even when the batteries are very low."
3,Good enough....,"This otoscope is teh least expensive out there. It will not show a clear picture of the ear drum. You can, however, definitely see the ear canal and see an infection. You will not actually be able to see a perforated ear drum or a miniscule infection. You can see the wax, though!! So, it's an okay product I say."
4,You would believe a man can fly!,"I'm into rc planes, so I couldn't resist the idea of a flying superman. Clever, the cape is delta wing with two electric motors for differential control. It's durable, it hit the ground a few times. Once I got it balanced out (needed two plastic disks at the back of the cape)so it wouldn't nose in with a full charge it can fly. Light or no winds, and a large soccer field is required for maximum fun. Sometimes the motors would cutout just before a hand launch, but with a light toss it can gain altitude (full throttle). Only disappointment is the requirement for 8 AA batteries for the transmitter. Should have been nicads (4) and a cigarette plug in charger like the Parkzone products from Horizon Hobby."
3,"R/C Flying Superman, Really flies.","Is a very funny toy, really it flies, but you need to get some practice and patience to fly it. Needs a little wind a more wind make your superman crash, needs too a very large open area, is for children over 10-12 years age or for adults with a lot of patience, be careful, if it drops and crash (2-5 times) very probably gets broke."
2,"""Pretty lame...""","This is an interesting concept, but it turns out there isn't a whole lot of ""meat"" here, making ""Alien Rock"" a pretty lame exercise.What little ""meat"" here is padded with tidbits of trivia and any paranormal experience linked with the celebrity under discussion. The author seems either starstruck or overly-credulous, referring to ""classic"" UFO sightings, conspiracy theories, conactee reports as uncontested fact.This book might help you impress your baby-boomer friends with your arcane knowledge of rock triva, but beyond that, not much of a reason to invest your time or money."
2,"""Mediocrity""","Because this film was poorly produced and put together, the ending is unintentionally telegraphed early on-- eliminating much of the essential suspense. You could possibly enjoy it as a ""mystery"" if you're willing and able to suspend belief for a few hours. Otherwise, be advised to stay away from this mediocrity."
3,Not great.,"I was expecting a bit more. There wasn't enough character development, esp in the case of the cops. Just when you feel like you know what's going on, a few more characters get knocked off and the film is basically over.What I liked most about this movie was Abigail's cool apartment. If you're interested in interior design you should see this film just to get a look at it."
1,"Disappointing, predictable, boring","I thought this stank. The acting, the camera work, the plot. Poor Beau Bridges seemed as desperate to get away from it as I was. I hope they didn't spend a lot of money on this drivel but I suppose they probably did."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A shameful return for Harrison Ford, Firewall is a study in unoriginal mediocrity that delights in proving to the audience, again and again, that exactly what they think is about to happen is indeed about to happen."
3,It at least makes for a good rental,Harrison Ford stars as a man forced to rob his own bank or his family will be killed. We've seen a lot of movies like that before. Even Hostage last year is a similar film. The script here can be silly from time to time but it's still a more entertaining movie than Hostage. Harrison Ford may be getting too old for parts like this but he's still in top form here. Mary Lynn Rajskub who plays Chloe in 24 isn't bad here either eventhough she's basically playing Chloe and she even gets to call Harrison Ford Jack. Paul Bettany also isn't bad as the villian eventhough I liked him more as one in the Da Vinci Code. One thing I find silly though is that while the bad guys take the family they also bring the family dog. Why do they need the dog ?
3,Predictable from beginning to end,"Harrison ford is a great actor and he does a decent acting job in this movie. The problem is this plot is the same kidnapping/ransom story that has been told over and over again. there really wasn't any kind of twist that would make it a unique story, it was just the same story told with a different cast. I guess they figured that since harrison ford was in it the story would appear to be different and better. LOL!!!!!!"
2,Harrison Ford Must need some money,Harrison Ford Must need some money. Save your money for DVD and watch it with some firends to split the cost. Weak plot. Implausible turns of events and mediocre acting.
1,Worst Ford Movie Ever!,"This is probably the worst Harrison Ford movie ever, and it's not his fault. He is WAY better than this film, which was so bad that his best efforts just couldn't pull this dog out of its nose-dive. Comparing this to ""What Lies Beneath"" is like comparing a Ford Pinto to a Lotus Europa. Yeah, they have something in common, but it isn't enough to make me want a Pinto because I can't afford the Europa! Stay away from this dog unless it's free or nearly so, or you're just dying to complete your Harrison Ford collection. To say the tech in this is lame, even for the standards of the day, is being too kind. And even at the time this movie was released, this plot was old and been done by others better. I'd choose ANY Harrison Ford movie before I'd choose this one. ""What Lies Beneath"" was creepy and amazing. This one is just dumb."
3,Better than expected,"Harrison Ford plays a man in charge of security for a large bank in Seattle. His family is kidnapped so that he will cooperate and find a way past the security for the thieves to steal $100 million dollars. Ford's character needs to find a way to rescue his family and keep the thieves from getting the money.This movie was better than I expected it to be. There are problems, especially with the underdevelopment of most of the characters in the film, but if you can overlook the obvious flaws, the movie builds some real tension in various scenes. There are no stellar performances here. Ford can sleepwalk through a role like this because he's done it so many times. Paul Bettany is good as the head bad guy. Everyone else is given so little to do they can't give great performances.You have to look past a script that is weak structurally, but if you can do that, Firewall is a decent movie."
2,Formulaic Ford,"As much as I love Harrison Ford's acting, this movie is not all that entertaining. It is an uninspired, by-the-numbers execution of a plot which was done much better in Bruce Willis' ""Hostage"" and numerous other films. There are no surprises or innovations along the way - it just goes on and on, and on, until it runs out of recycled plot devices, and, mercifully, ends."
2,Clear and Present Doodoo,"If not for the mildly intrigueing 1/2 hour, I would have probably given this one the single star treatment. Pretty sadto hear ole Harrison being harangued by the juvenile story ofthis movie. Firewall was a fire sale of eigth grade ideas about technology and suspense. The bad guys seem totally ineptand there were about a hundred ways Harrison could have given them false info, retracted the info, notified the police, etc etc. Anyways, bascially it is the kidnap dilemna, do you concede to the ransom or call in the cops, not much suspense.The movie just gets worse as it goes along, until the down rightlaughable ending. The last 15 minutes were straight out of a macho mexican western. Old and decrepit Han Solo was brawlingas the script ran out of ideas, reminding me of Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Premise. This movie is bad...and sad."
5,Firewall (Widescreen Edition),I thought I had already reviewed this product. I like the movie.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
3,"Well, it kept me awake!","It was good enough to keep me awake while watching the movie. It had alot of action in the movie, kept you on your toes, but it was one I will never watch again even if there isn't anything on tv that day. Harrison Ford has made alot of GREAT movies, but this one was not one of them."
2,A disappointment at best.,"This movie has a great cast. What it suffers from is a long-winded, predictable storyline and too little action for a movie starring one of the greatest action stars in the past few decades. The action that was present in the movie was hokey and paced in such a way as to be uninteresting.The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because I stayed until the end. Honestly though, I am not sure if I stayed because the story was at least good enough to waste some time with or because I had already spent the money for the ticket. A truly disappointing notch in the belt of some fine actors."
4,Pretty much a bullseye!,"This is a really good collection. The Memphis Minnie selections are excellent choices, and I almost would've paid the price for the Mississippi Matilda songs alone. Unfortunately there are only two of them; the liner notes indicate that her material is sparse and based on the slight digging I've done, it's true. But if you like classic and country blues, especially sung by women (there are a few duets with the men on here as well) you will love this CD. Memphis Minnie was unusual for blues women of this time period in that she was an excellent guitar player as well as singer, but in addition she is accompanied on four of the songs by a guitarist who is believed to be Big Bill Broonzy. This CD is definitely recommended."
1,You get what you pay for,"This was by far the worst headset I have ever used. The battery would constantly die, and would take 6-8 hours to charge. I could figure I would have use of the headset every two days."
4,Good for beginners,"The guide is a good start for someone who has no idea about WOW. It gives details about what you should do as a beginner.For those who are already familiar with the basic stuff, this is still good as you can take this as a reference guide and use it whenver you need it."
2,Useful for Noobs,"If you are new to the game it is ok.After the first few days, I found it not useful. Several weeks and 20+ levels later, I don't even know where the thing is.There is information in there, but it is not organized well, so finding it is a challenge.They should have included better guides for each of the classes, I have found much better information on the various websites for WOW.If you are going to spend money on this...I suggest the hard cover WOW Atlas. It is much more useful, and a nice looking book as well."
2,World of Warcraft Strategy Guide,"Paid to much for a book that is FAR from complete, it is missing whole maps from the world (ex. Silithus)also missing are a large number of items both trained and found. I found in writing a complaint to Bradygames, that in order to get the missing information one had to sign up for a membership and buy some kind of notebook, then the addons would be offered, also the company refuses to respond to any form of contact. Maybe if they had wasted less space on the comics and more on information it would have been a more worth while book."
3,"MMO's are dynamic, the content of this book isn't","The idea behind this book is great. Give me the information so I can be better at my game and how I play it. The problem that you run into is that MMO's are a dynamic environment. In as little as two patches of content you can be greatly outdated. Now throw in the 3 expansions and it is a trip down memory lane when you look at this book. You want up to date info to start out with? Go to WoW dot com, wowhead etc. No fault of Brady Games at all, it is just very hard to keep an up to date book out."
2,Save your money,"This is a pretty thorough guide, but also unnecessary. I played WOW for about a month and knew everything it was teaching. If you are in a big hurry to learn very fast, consider buying this; but to enjoy the game, just teach yourself. People already playing the game online are very helpful, just ask people questions on there."
4,Misquito dunks,"We use this product all the time and although we still do have some misquitos, I do think it makes a difference to treat any standing water."
4,Mosquito pucks work!,"We bought 100 pucks (dunks) and tossed them around in our big pond and swampy area twice this spring and summer. Other rural areas of our city had the usual almost unbearable load of mosquitos...we had hardly any! Was it the dunks? We don't know for sure, but I've already got 100 ready in the cupboard for next season!"
3,doesn't keep mosquitos dead long enough.,"I'm getting the feeling that this donut only contains the bt toxin and not the actual microorganism that produces the bt toxin. I put one or two in my backyard pond and for a while all the larvae float up dead but after about maybe two weeks the larvae come back again. good things these dunks are cheap. if you have a vast track of infestation in the water, i've found it better to split up one dunk and adding small bits so that I don't waste the dunks."
5,Made a difference!,I am a living mosquito attractor. So I got the dunks and stuck them in all our seepage pits and put the granules in other areas. It made a difference within a few weeks. I plan to keep it up for next year.
3,Works But Messy,"I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but..."
2,me and birds are disappointed,"I bought the tablets because I enjoy watching birds bathe in a bird bath in my yard and yet I did not want to breed mosquitoes in there. When a tablet melts it makes the water look very bad, stagnant with brown foamy stuff floating on the surface. It looks worse than a dirty puddle by the road. Not only I cannot enjoy the look of the pretty bird bath but birds seem to avoid it as well. Finally, yesterday I washed the bird bath, poured clean water without any tablets and saw birds in there right away.I am looking for other solutions to prevent mosquitoes. I am very upset by the wasted money, it is not cheap to just throw away."
3,a jaunt through British India,"This is the colorful story of the author's jaunt through British India, containing numerous fascinating anecdotes and glimpses into native life. He plays up the dramatic aspects, of course, but that is what his readers wanted."
4,Wish it came in shorter size,"Great product, excellent value. My only complaint is that they are a little bit too long for my short legs. Small would have been too tight, but medium was too long.Other than that, great product."
1,"Hideous howling feedback gets worse over time, BUY BOSE!!!","I waited long enough that I'm out of warranty so I smashed the stupid things over a tree. I feel better now. Seriously, whatever noise there is hurts less than the howling."
4,Great sound but quite bulky,"I just got back from another quiet flight thanks to the Sony noise canceling headphones and my iPod. The sound quality was terrific! It blocks external noise so well that I accidently aggravated a flight attendant because I didn't even hear his beverage offer. The downside is bulkiness which only bothers me slightly for sleeping and is more inconvenient due to the precious carry-on space it consumes.Its really important to put them on the right way because the ear pieces are slanted making them smash ears when wrong but comfortable when correct. I also found I need to remember to turn them off after use to save battery life which I just wasn't used to from regular headphones.All in all, I'm happy with my purchase of these headphones."
4,Noise cancelling is great - sound quality is a bit lacking..,"My baseline for comparing any higher-end pair of headphones I get from Sony are *still* my 15-year-old MDR-V6 (digital studio monitor) headphones. They were 150 dollars in 1989. They still sound great and have only needed their earfoams replaced.I just got a pair of these MDR-NC50s for 116 bucks. And the noise cancelling is *outstanding*. It's at *least* as good as the Bose (which I've also used). But the sound quality leaves something to be desired - especially when compared to my MDR-V6's. A lot of the midrange and trebles are being drowned out. All in all they sound great, but I think Sony could do better. Definitely worth the discounted price, however."
3,Not very comfortable,"I did research on the web for various noise cancelling headsets. I wanted a pair due to the amount of time I spend on airplanes. This Sony one had the most positive reviews for the price. However, there certainly are disadvantages. Here is my summary:Advantages:Reasonable price compared to competitionFair job of noise cancellationAdjustableDisadvantagesThese put a lot of pressure on the ears causing discomfort after about 30 minutes use.The top of the headset is hard and starts hurting the top of your head after abour 60 minutes.The headsets do not fold up so they are bulky in your carry-on luggage."
2,NOT better than the Bose headphones,"I've owned the Bose QC II's for some time and decided to try these based upon the spotlight review that says that they are way better than the Bose.It just isn't true. The Bose headphones are much lighter and much more comfortable. Given the difference, I didn't even bother to compare the audio quality. I just sent these back."
3,"I know they arrive smaller than the photo, but...(updated)","But mine arrived very tiny, and I'm wondering how long it will take them to grow to be similar to the image in the listing. I know it probably looks worse than it is...but I'm reserving judgement on this until spring moves on and I see these plants growing and possibly giving fruit.UPDATE: So I wrote a review when I originally disappointingly received this. And now 6 months later, I have to say that I have nice little (emphasis on little) citrus bushes, but no fruit. Buyer beware that the photos shown are far in the future. I will continue to nurse these plants to see if they will turn into that 'perfect' photo from the future."
2,"charming movie but disappointed with ""Sweetheart Tree""","I don't really want to slam the whole soundtrack, but I bought the soundtrack specifically for two songs -- and I felt cheated on one of them.One of my favorite songs from the movie was ""Sweetheart Tree"" sung (presumably) by Natalie Wood. The version on the soundtrack, however, has all of the vocals handled by a chorus -- no solo singer.Note: I have since learned that, for the movie, the vocals on ""Sweetheart Tree"" were lip-sync'd by Natalie Wood and were really sung by Jackie (Robin) Ward. I really didn't care WHO sang it -- I just wanted the CD to have the same vocals that I heard while watching the movie.Note: My other favorite, ""He Shouldn't-A, Hadn't-A, Oughtn't-A ..."" was the real deal with Dorothy Provine."
4,Surround Sound,These speakers are really great. If you have a Playstation 2 console and want to get the best sound. Get these.
1,Absolutely The Worst Headphones Ever!,"Wow. I have used some really crappy quality headphones in my life thus far and I am awed to say that this is the new low. The best way for me to describe the sound would be that these headphones are like a ""magical"" filter that filters all your wonderful sources of sound, be it musics or movies, into a horrible sounding AM radio. That's how they sound. So, don't buy these headphones unless they are dirtcheap and you really really really need some headphones in a hurry."
3,PHP Fast & Easy Web Development,"This was a rather short book. 472 pages but the fonts and diagrams were huge. I read it in three days. What this book covered was the basics of PHP, good for any beginners wanting to learn PHP with no prior programming experience (With the exception of HTML).There was no case assigments or anything in this book to test your knoweldge of PHP. There were a few, not many, but a few typo errors in some of the source code in the book, which may confuse a beginner if they are just starting out. This book covered the basics and *only* the basics of PHP web development. However, this book has a very good constructed reference of PHP functions and MySQL."
3,"Good book, buy make sure you download the corrections!!","Hi all,I've been using this book, off and on, for several months. Overall, she uses a simple straightforward example of how to write sample scripts...If you want a very simple book to get your feet wet learning PHP, then this is worth it, especially when you compare its price vs. other books that are pretty pricey.It needs to be said that I am not fully through this book so if I change my feelings while completing it..."
5,Pretend play fun,"Purchased for a 4 year old & 6 year old loved it too. I don't think it will likely last long because the cape is vinyl/plastic, but I purchased it at a very low sale price, so for what I paid, it was well worth it. Both kids played for hours going back and forth with the cape & sharing thePunch N' Crush Gloves Accessorywhich I also purchased. 5 stars for educational because they're using their imaginations."
4,Worked well for my purpose,My elderly horse would get small infections in her 4 white stockings during the summer months - likely an immune system response to the environment due to her age.I spritzed this on her lower legs every couple of days after first washing them with an anti-bacterial hand soap to minimize any infection setting in and it did the job.
3,Read carefully the measurements - this is very short,"The pad is 9 inches too short to cover my queen-size bed. Also, it's not the eggcrate featured in the pictures. The foam is less ""pointy"" at the peaks, a little rounded and flat and it is a light seafoam green color. Shipping time was just a few days by FedEx."
1,crap,some times it works then other times i doesnt the ink is super $$$ and ot constantly have to have it reajust its self its loud and once i printed half a page and other times it take half an hour for some prints to get to the printer got it at Circuit City with my computer in 2007
2,It looked repackaged.,I bought this for my brother and I thought it was the entire cd but it was a single cd with only 3 songs. It arrived in a see through case with wrap put over it.
2,Not recommended,"Inu Yasha is a GREAT series. There's no doubt about it. So then why do I give it a 2 star review? This is because of Viz's decision to release three episodes per disc. While the three episode format is fine for a short thirteen episode series, it is simply Unacceptable for a series like Inu Yasha, which is 90+ episodes and still on air in Japan. Furthermore, Inuyasha is the kind of series which one has to watch a lot of before he/she becomes absorbed in it. Three episodes alone is an extremely meager offering, and I for one refuse to buy this on DVD."
2,"Decent movie, but doesn't do the series justice.","I've been a huge fan of the Halloween series of movies since I was a kid. And Rob Zombie's interpretation of the first Halloween movie thrilled me, as it delved into the history of Michael Myers that the original didn't. After seeing Rob's first Halloween, I was very eagerly anticipating this second one, since Halloween II was my favorite of the original Halloween series. However, this one seemed to miss the mark with me. It wasn't a BAD movie. It just didn't expand on the original like the first one did. Rob's Halloween II seemed more centered on the violence aspect and was closer to a ""Torture Porn"" genre than a true ""Slasher"". Also, there was a lot of just plain weird stuff in it that made it hard to follow.Overall, as a big fan of the Halloween series, this was worth watching. If for no other reason, just to see someone else's take on the movie. But, next time I sit down to watch Halloween II, it will be the original."
1,Horrible! Don't waste your money on this junk,This was such a horrible mess. Hopefully they won't ask Rob Zombie to do anymore Halloween movies after this crap. His remake was enjoyable- I really liked it- but this was just HORRIBLE. There is no suspense element whatsoever to this movie- he just walks up to people and slashes them to death. It's so overdone that you know it's VERY VERY acted without giving it an element of realism. He should have done another movie with his ideas and left Michael Myers completely out of his idea for a new Halloween because it just doesn't work at all. I doubt they will be asking him to do another Halloween movie since this one bombed so bad. I AM very happy I didn't pay theatre price for this trash. Thank god for netflix.
4,"Good movie, symbolic","This movie is a good sequel. The beginning reminded me of the original sequel which I loved. The whole movie was pretty good & I own it. I can see why so many people think this movie is atrocious, but they are failing to see the symbolism in this movie. At the beginning it gives you the symbolic definition of a white horse, which is a sign for purity. The visions in the movie that Laurie have are showing her connection with Michael and they are not just pointless. This movie was pretty good but nothing can compare to the first two. I like how Zombie took a different approach to the story instead of just re-doing it as we have seen before (Friday the 13th, which I thought was awful.) HIs take on it adds a whole new perspective and people need to realize that. Great movie, just wish there was more of Michael chasing Laurie whic freaked me out in the first place with the originals."
3,Creative liberty...,"Well, Rob Zombie basically could do whatever he wanted in this entry, and he did. Yes, there is a lot of gratuitous violence. And yes, his trademark ""hillbilly"" characters seem to dot the landscape. But, there is something deeply human and raw about this Halloween. No, it won't be for everyone. Unless you are fond of quizzical cameos, like that of Margot Kidder and Weird Al Yankovic. Zombie is obviously a diehard fan of the horror genre, and it shows. He pulls out all the stops and gives us his version of a Halloween that could never be, but now always will. I don't think he ruined anything. He merely was given a chance and now shows us a ""Halloween"" through his creative lens. Nothing right or wrong about it. It simply is. It won't scare you, nor will it be lauded, but it sticks with you. Like it or not."
5,RZ's Halloween 2,"If you are interested in this, you need to see the first movie first!!! And Rob Zombie is simply the best person to remake this classic movie set!!!"
2,"Its okay,",kinda wish 1 & 2 remakes had a different directors and writers. Rob Zombie just overdoes it. and I REALLY wish 2 was actually a remake. oh well.
3,"Good, but....","Flashy, inventive, involving, fast-paced ... but it's over 2 soon, & everything happens SO FAST -- I wish it were longer, say as long as Delany's DHALGREN. I'd like some time 2 think over what happens here, or at least pause 2 catch my breath. Years after reading & re-reading all 3 of them, I still think EMPIRE STAR and EINSTEIN INTERSECTION R better...."
2,Works well until the headset fries,"I really like this headset for work - I can listen to music (albeit monaurally) and easily switch to answer the phone. Also, it's cheaper than just about every other phone headset out there. However - that cheapness really shows in the shoddy durability of the headset. After about 3 months of use, the wire between the base and the headset breaks, and you have to buy a whole new set to make it work. If Logitech fixes this problem, this will be a great phone/pc headset. Otherwise, it's $20 every few months."
2,Book falling apart,"I have had this book for a week and it is falling apart. It is cheaply put together.The information in the book is alright, not the best presentation of information."
5,It was a pleasure to listen to while driving or parked.,"The fourth album lives up to its previous ones. Absoulutly fantastic! Its blend of storytelling and music never cease to amaze me. I have all the Celestial Navigations stories on tape and now wish to obtain them on CD. They can be listened to over and over and never grow tired of how each story is woven together. My favorite ones were ""The Sniper"", ""Home"" and ""The Window"". It is in the best interests of everyone that these stories and the others before them be made available again. ""Imagination is more important than knowledge"" -Albert Einstein"
2,Didn't work for us,We have a small farm pond with an algae problem. We put 4 of these in the pond and waited...no change...ever. Buy an algaecide.2 stars only because the item was exactly as described and it may work for different types of algae. Who knows.
1,Did not work,"After I built my pond I used this product thinking it would prevent or slow the growth of algae in my new pond. However, at least for me it did not work. While this bale was floating around my pond the pond water got greener and greener and hair algae started covering every thing. The barley was decaying at the time so I know it should have been working. The algae was getting so bad my pond started to smell like a sewer. I thought I may have done something wrong. So I drained the pond and cleaned it out. When I refiled it I decided to try the other bale in the new water and after 1 week I saw the algae beginning to grow again. I ended up buyingPondCare Algae Destroyer Advanced, 16-Ounceand in less than 24 hours my pond was crystal clear. I no longer use the barley. If you are looking for a fish safe product to keep algae in check I would recommend the Algae destroyer product."
2,"all she does is..sleep,sleep,sleep",I am not mad but all new born puppys sleep but this is a toy it was boring at first.I think it was fun.my dog passed away last year and I was so sad but this dog turned my world! now i'm happy.
2,they're mediocore,"I've had these speakers for quite a while and all I can say is you get what you pay for. the sub on these speakers are to muddy and bassy. Plus a little annoying. The satellites are weak. They only have a mid-range driver so the treble is pretty awful on these. Honestly I think your better off with speakers from creative or altec. My little brother got some speakers from creative in the same price range and those speakers are much more better balanced compared to the logitechs and on top of that they're 4.1. Another bonus about the creatives my brother bought is that it comes with a nice little control pod that you usually only see in the higher end speakers. All in all the logitechs sound quality is pretty poor compared to other speakers. It would be best to just save up for something better, buy from another company or even better just stick with headphones."
4,Works fairly well with lousy card,"Overall, these speakers are quality for ok price. I have AC97 integrated audio, and they sound decent. I'd recommend a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card with these, because it has such great reviews and should work well with the system. Logitech is only starting out with the speaker business, as it's a keyboard and mice company, but these still edge out the competition.So-- buy these if you don't have the space for surround sound or the money for Klipsch's."
3,Just OK,"These speakers are very good ...pair of speakers. Huge plus is the built in headphone jack in the speaker. (Tip: if you don't have a headphone jack, just go to Radio Shack and by a Y-adapter so both the speakers and the headphones are plugged into the one sound card. They're both always on, but just turn the speaker volume down/off.)Not sure why people love these speakers. Creative has a pair that sounds a little better in my opinion (but no headphone jack). Yes these speakers are loud and yes the bass vibrates the walls, but I need solid mid ranges to enjoy music and these tiny speakers have a very tiny sound. Luckily MP3 players have equalizers and other sound 'adjusters' that allow you to compensate, but that gets old fast when your play list bounces between Rap, Techno and Rock and you have to adjust the EQ every time the type of song changes."
1,no answer key!,"This book is very thorough, however, it does not come with an answer key for the many exercises. There is a separate answer key book, but apparently it is no longer in print. What good is a book with no answer key? It's very frustrating."
4,"Good quality and price, good value","It's an extraordinary building, and the photography is of a quality worthy of the architecture.If I could change this book, I would make it larger. Its small page size means you have to look closely to see the images well. I would rather it be big enough to be a coffee table book, and would be willing to pay more. Otherwise, it's an excellent photo-documentary of a brilliant and facinating building. I keep it visable on my desk."
4,Wow.............?,"This movie was a pretty good flick. It had imagination, a great score, a working plot, but the stroy line wasn't all that original. It looked like a mix between 'The Giver' and 'Fahrenhiet 451'. It also took a little while to get to the action. It was also strange to see Christian Bale to play such a good guy. But, yeah, it was good."
4,futuristic bale shooter,"Sci-fi thriller taking place in a future where emotions are not tolerated. Good picture, atmosphere, and cinematography among a few cheesy elements and recognizable actors. Decent movie, worth a few bucks."
4,Terrific Version of Farenheit 451,"Looking through the reviews, I noticed that there were actually dim bulbs out there comparing this film to The Matrix. Huh? Well, evidently some online reviewers either can't or don't read, and can only make comparisons to things that exist in the most recent annals of pop culture. This film is actually an update of the classic book and film, ""Farenheit 451"". It does a convincing job of portraying a militaristic society of intellectual and artistic intolerance (""Matrix"" comparers, anyone?). Bale is terrific, as is the supporting cast. There are some pretty harrowing moments, and the message as is poignant now as it has been for the past several decades. Recommended for thinking sci-fi enthusiasts."
4,Amazing futuristic martial arts action,"This film, a real sleeper, portrays a future totalitarian regime where human emotions are pharmacologically excised and creations that trigger emotions are outlawed. The protagonist is a 'grammaton cleric', a super-martial artist SS-officer type who enforces this creed. Our protagonist misses his dose and then explores a new path in his life.I loved this movie for the very interesting martial arts and ""gun-kata"" action.Equilibrium is not as improbable as the matrix because it is more grounded in realism. It's premise of a Bradburian Farenheit-451 / Orwellian regime is a bit shallow compared to those works.It you like films about totalitarian regimes or futuristic martial arts violence, you will not be disappointed. If you are disturbed by movies where body parts are sliced off, look elsewhere."
2,Lacks depth.,"Equilibrium is a fair movie. Almost everything about the production was quite good. But as so often happens with productions like this, it lacks philosophical depth. The conflict between parties is made too black and white. It would have been a much more interesting story if we knew the suffering that drove humanity to that condition, if there was some room for doubt that the protagonist was doing the right thing. A excellent movie leaves you with something to think about. This one does not."
5,Excellent!,This movie made me a Christian Bale fan! I love this movie but could not find it anywhere but on Amazon. Movie was brand new and arrived super fast. Great service.
4,Interesting and full of emotions...a total paradox,I like the movie...is very good and has lots of good material to talk about.
2,A martial arts film as a sci fi future?,"Can one be loyal to the Matrix...in n reruns?Yes, this is a future mind controlfilm patterned on the Matrix.Only the world isn't virtualand the low is drug inducednot plugged in.Worlds where revolt is by a ""super hero""who is the savior.In the true future I think we will all be our own priestsand saviors and I doubtthat as tempting as killing evil seems,that is the solution.Rome was brought to an end byChristians who were not above being eaten by lionsin the coliseum.The eastern martial arts...in a anti-utopia?!"
5,Awesome movie that few know about,"This movie is really great. The plot is unique, the acting is wonderful, and the action sequences are really really cool. A must see for any action movie enthusiest. Christian Bale is the man."
5,Awsome movie!!,"Oh my god, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has such great fight scenes and an awsome plot and theme. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a great movie. I love Equilibrium!"
2,no surprises,"there was a reason this film never made it to the theatres. now, i know why.it's not a terrible film, but it just doesn't work. the action scenes aren't particularly believable, even with suspension of disbelief, they just don't ring true ... and that false note carries on through the rest of the movie, as well. everything seems forced. the plot just doesn't have a good flow. it's like a building constructed by a little kid with high-tech building blocks; nice material, but it doesn't hold together well."
1,Prosaicum,"Falls apart early on when Preston says ""I beg your pardon?"" An expression designed to take into account the feelings of others.A Big Brother police state that doesn't eavesdrop on interrogations nor has a surveillance camera behind the bathroom mirror instead of pipes? Inspite of increasingly hopeless odds, the film manages to keep you on side in the entertainment stakes until it finally all falls apart in the last quarter with a cut price Matrix rip-off. Strictly for the young, dumb and full of...er, rum."
3,Decent Fight Scenes,"Cruel utopian society stories have been written so many times before. This one doesn't really add anything. However, it does invent a new fighting technique that may or may not be possible. During a shootout, the hero keeps twisting his body so that opponents' bullets are most likely to miss. Of course he could have just hit the floor but that wouldn't look nearly as cool, would it now?"
2,"Movie was good, but sound was terrible...","No, I actually liked the movie a lot- unfortunately Amazon.com does not provide a way to rate their own DELIVERY of the movie. With every movie that I have watched so far on Amazon's streaming service there has been the same problem; lousy sound. I mean , I have to turn up the volume so much just to hear the voices that the feedback through the speakers produces background noise that makes what the actors are saying almost incomprehensible. This is not the film's fault, but that of the provider of the streaming (Amazon). I do not have this problem with videos and movies downloaded from Itunes. In truth, the movie itself deserves at least 4 stars, but Amazon needs to correct the sound problem and provide a way to criticize its delivery service."
3,"Love the movie, not impressed by the blu ray","If you have seen the movie you will like this just fine, however the Blu Ray is not anything special, I didn't own it on DVD so I got the blu ray. But it will be up to you if you are updating your dvd collection to blu ray if you want to buy this movie."
5,This is a sleeper -- big time!,"This movie works -- big time -- due to a superb cast, amazing fight scenes, a well-written story that captures you emotionally, and excellent production values (direction, photography, editing, etc.) Well well done. Also, the score will blow you away. Christian Bale should have been nominated for some award for his work in this movie -- he is brilliant. It's so hard to make all the pieces come together in a movie, that for Wimmer to have accomplished this with limited resources is amazing. (I apologize for all the superlatives; just can't help myself.)"
3,Not original OAR!,"Be aware that this is a Canadian import blu-ray and that Alliance has decided to yet again create 1.78:1 out of a movie that was 2.35:1. This means no black bars, but it also means edges of the image are missing and that it's been zoomed in. While I don't own this movie, I think that fans of this film (of which I am one) should consider holding off until a US release. Alliance regularly screws with the aspect ratio of their releases for some reason."
4,not some poor man's matrix...,"to compare this movie to the overhyped matrix, is a injustice.despitr it'swellian influences, equilibrium stands on it's own as an action sci-fi flick. no cheesy dialogue, but more like comic book noir. the fight scences were the best since the BLADE films. the pacing of the story was slow and a bit dull but so was the matrix.at least you can identify with bale's character, the ending although predictable. completed the story, thus no need for a sequel. it's the best sci-fi b-movie since the terminator or escape from new york. skip senseless [stuff] like XXX or the borne identitiy and buy this movie."
1,NEVER RECIEVED PRODUCT!!!!,"I sent an email asking about my product because it had not arrived yet, never recieved a response. Amazon had to refund my money! Will not do business with again, was supposed to be a christmas present!"
2,Stupid and Violent,"Stupidity and violence don't need to go hand in hand, but in this movie they do. I bought this as a present for someone who requested it. This movie was one demensional. The bad guys were all stupid, the plot and storyline were poor at best. I like Christian Bale, but can't understand why he would agree to make this movie at this time in his career. I would compare this movie to a ""B"" movie or a made for video movie. I feel sorry for anyone who paid good money to see this at the theater."
4,Eyes Without A Face.....,"This movie is great. If you like sci-fi flicks that present an alternative reality or a glimpse of a possible future such as The Matrix or Soylent Green, you will like this. Individual tastes are different I am aware, but give this one a chance. It moves a bit slowly at times, and you may find yourself wanting for more action, but it is presented so well from cinematic and story-building standpoint that it is worth watching."
5,Don't believe the negative hype.,"The action in this futuristic parable on censorship (of mind, body, and perhaps soul) is by far the best I've seen in a long time. The idea of gun katas is genius and inspired and Christian Bale was obviously tapped to be the next batman after someone saw this film. Sure the future world isn't perfect, as several critics pointed out, but then again it is a parable NOT a REAL view of the future. So if you go in looking for a good action/drama/parable then you will definitely enjoy this one."
4,Equilbrium = Matrix Rev 2,"Professional movie critics hate this movie. In other words, regular folk would probably enjoy it. I certainly did. Yes, the plot isn't exactly Pulitzer candidate, but it's good enough glue together the excellent action sequences. Imagine the action sequences of The Matrix done better. Highly recommended."
3,An Under-rated sci-fi action/drama,"Christian Bale stars as a man that starts to have emotion and feeling in a world where it's a crime. The film starts out with him as a cop fighting and killing people who feel. A prisinor played Emily Watson makes him curious to what it would feel like to have emotion. He then realizes that the right to feel and have emotion is worth fighting for. He decides to fight and stand up to the system he once stood for. The action is fun if not a little too quick and often even silly. I mean Christian Bale fights a bunch of cops just to defend a puppy for god's sake.Equilibrium has been called a Matrix rip-off among being called a rip-off of many other Sci-fi films. I think it stands on it's own though. It's a good movie if you look past the silly plot. The performances by Bale, Watson Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, the cool looking atmosphere and the action make it worth watching."
1,Wait don't get this DEMAND BETTER!!!!!,-----------2.0 STEREO ?!?!?!?!?!?--------------Had to give 1 star even though I love this film.From what I understand and if true can sum it up: Alliance (the totally crappy Canadian distributer) also owns Echo Bridge who is who bought the rights from Miramax.Also as the other reviewer mentioned this release is in the wrong aspect ratio. The movie was filmed in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. This Blu-Ray is in 1.78.1 aspect ratio.It is possible both of these things are wrong (2.0 Stereo and Aspect Ratio) but that is how it is listed on the Blu-Ray case in front of me and I'm debating weather I should return it or not so I have not opened it yet.I was so looking forward to this release......bummer.Edit: 2.0 stereo and wrong aspect ratio confirmed see comment.
5,Excellent movie,"I had never heard of this movie until I saw it and I thought it was great. The action sequences aren't cheesy like most movies, they're very nicely coreographed and executed; everything is just so precise. They also didn't resort to the cheesy bullet time stuff that the Matrix uses so much (while the nifty graphics in the Matrix are cool, the fact that they're almost all CG takes away from their value). If you like 1984/Brave New World and a Matrix-type story line without the religious innuendo, this is a great movie for you."
4,Flashes of brilliance,"Yes, Equilibrium is, overall, a terribly derivative movie (1984, Farenheit 451, etc.) but it contains some truly original concepts and moments.One of director Wimmer's real masterstrokes is the sequence in which the villain DuPont carefully explains the theory behind the Gun Kata - in terms just plausible enough to allow the audience to accept the stunning action choreography. It's a seductive idea, beautifully executed by stunt choreographer Jim Vickers in all the action sequences.Another particular highlight is the leadup to the final confrontation between Preston and his nemesis, played by Taye Diggs. Wimmer has carefully established their rivalry to the point where the audience is salivating to see them go head to head ... then he surprises us with a twist ... then stuns us with ANOTHER twist that is, in itself, one of the most original applications of fight choreography I've ever seen."
2,"Lots of bugs, too easy to beat.","This game is riddled with bugs, I kept having to start a level over because something would get stuck. Even with all that, I beat it the day after I got it. Very easy once you figure it out. Overall I liked it, but it was too easy to beat and too buggy."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I bought this game after weeks of wanting it so badly. I love tycoon games like this. School Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, etc. And this idea really appealed to me. But after getting it home and trying for an hour to get it to load up I became frustrated and gave up. It would load up Storybox mode halfway and then completely close down and say there was an error with my memory. I even had to clear up some disk space to supposedly get this running but no such luck. This requires 619 MB (I believe...) and wouldn't run but I later installed The Sims which requires somewhere in the thousands MB and it works great. Don't buy this game! It's a POS!"
1,issues installing,dont get... you will have issues with installing this game. I have a new and updated pc and can't get the game to work. And come to find out many other buyers have the same issue.
5,catchy indie-pop rocks!,"I got this album many years ago (97?) when I was in Columbia House's CD club. Not quite sure what attracted me to it, but am I glad that I did! The unique sound of integrating a cello into indie-rock just works. Mostly acoustic, the songs are extremely catchy and the album definitely has a relaxing groove.My favorites tracks: Going through the motions, Feel my way, Into the light, I guess I'm in luckThis is one of those albums you just play over and over, it's great!Related bands: Blake Babies, Antenna"
1,Look like a secure lock!!,Why would you buy a product where vendor cannot put the correct picture on the webpage?
3,Strong smell,"This product is very nice to keep you warm while doing almost anything, but it is very strong smelling. If strong smells bother you, pass on this one."
1,Don't buy if you expect this to LOCK!,"I bought this because it was advertised as a ""locking"" door pull, but it has no locking features whatsoever, just latches on either side and can be opened from either side.....just like dozens of other similar latches on the net...."
2,Has its issue,"In response to the other posters complaining that its not a secure lock...its not. No pocket door latches are that I've seen. They can all be unlatched from the other side with a screwdriver or a coin and a little bit of effort. They're designed that way intentionally. If you want a secure locking door that you can't open from the other side at all, don't have a pocket door. They're usually for closets and bathrooms where you only need to deter someone from mistakenly walking in on you.that being said, i don't like this lock simply because the screw holes are so close to the hole cutout that you'll invariably split the wood trying to drive in the 4 securing screws. I ended up having to glue it on the door! Poorly engineered."
5,"Good shin guard cover,",My son needed new shin guard covers and this product fit the mark. He uses it for practice and games.
2,hollow guilty reading,"Enjoying Bright Lights, Big City (20 years ago), and after seeing decent reviews for this, I looked forward to reading the Good Life.On the positive side, it was a quick read, whose soap opera story lines (that's the guilty part)and sound storytelling keeps you involved and pushing forward. But, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it becomes played out as a modern version of the Great Gatsby where the shallow characters become people you could care less about, and the dialog between those characters becomes increasingly abysmal. If you do read it, the telephone exchanges between the two primary characters is particularly painful."
1,no longer a fan,"I've read almost everything else by jay mcinerney, and while I liked his books at the time, apparently I have outgrown him. This book is full of unsympathetic, shallow people behaving badly to one another, implicitly using 9/11 as an excuse. It's too bad because I liked Brightness Falls, to which this book is a sequel. Anyway, if you want to strongly dislike humanity and be repelled by some of the most embarrassing 'erotic' writing ever put to paper, go ahead and buy this book."
5,The Absolute Best CD!,"I love jazz and this, without a doubt, has been the best CD I have heard in a long time. A friend let me listen to it because he thought I'd like it and I loved it. You definitely cannot go wrong with this CD. I have listened to it every day for 7 straight days and have not tired of it yet. I will definitely buy more of his music."
1,"Guaranteed to stick, impossible to clean . . . .","This pan was a vast disappointment: No matter what you do to prevent it,the wedges will stick. And talking about a nightmare to clean up! I've simplycleaned it the best I could and oiled it and stashed it for use later--perhapsas a trotline weight."
5,Best scone pan ever,"My husband bought this pan for me for Christmas and I am in love with it. This is only the second piece of cast iron cookware I have ever owned (the other was a frying pan, which was pathetic and I ended up throwing it away after the second use), so I really wasn't sure what to expect from this. However, it has performed BEAUTIFULLY over the past six months.I grease each compartment generously with coconut oil before pouring in my scone batter. The scones bake perfectly--golden on the outside, moist and tender on the inside--and they pop right out of the pan without leaving residue. The longer I've used this pan, the better it has performed. I hardly need to grease it anymore, but I still do, just to get the benefits of the coconut oil. If this pan were a man, I'd marry it."
2,When bad books happen to good parents,"Dr. Hoffman's book provides ample case studies and illustrative examples of what he considers to be the ""Uncaring Child Syndrome."" As a conservative Christian parent I have experienced hostile, defiant, and malignant behavior from my son. His unwillingness to participate in church activities and follow the Lord is disturbing to me. My son is certainly ""uncaring"" when it comes to being a part of our family as well as our church family. Dr. Hoffman's book and his six discipline steps have not helped me as a parent to transform my child from one who does not care to one who does about the Lord or about his parents."
4,Good size and durable,"I love the size and durability of this book. I wanted a place to keep all important medical information for future reference. This book definately provides that. Well child visits are thoroughly covered. However, sick visits documentation are very limitied. It contains a page to writed down how each birthday is celebrated. That's a plus for me. Overall, I'm pleased with this book."
3,good music,I grew up listening to this music.Brings back good memories.Listen to it in my car on long trips to other states.
5,A haunting depiction of both the future and the past.,"This futuristic novel trancends the ordinary with a trip back into 1300s Europe. This novel of strife and antisemetic feelings adds a new dimension to the Jewish plight. Although I have read many Holocaust novels, this book added a new and frightening dimension when looking at similiar hatred and unjustified crimes against a people centuries before Hitler existed. This novel would add a great deal of historical perspective to any World War II discussion. A great read."
3,The Cure,"I thought The Cure was okay, it was confusing sometmes and the way they talk sounds strange. I didnt like it overall because I'm not in to these types of books.The bookwas set in the future and everything was controlled and the same. If you weren't like every one else you were ""recycled.""The main character is not conforming to society and the people in charge give hom two options a quik and painless death or ""the cure."" So he picks the cure and is sent off to a secret location were the elders stay. There his journey begins."
4,Some of the best cyberpunk I've read,"I really think that Carter outdoes even William Gibson in_The Fortunate Fall_. That may be heresy, but it's true--not only is there technological detail abound, but there's a close, familiar human quality that draws me in even more. Cyberpunk has fast become a hardboiled subgenre, but I may be forced to rethink that opinion--Carter opens doors that most cyberpunk authors never thought about searching for. This book is well-worth reading."
3,Parts of this book are excellent. Some parts are tedious.,"I almost tossed this book during the first 60 pages. It was very hard to get into, hard to believe the characters. At about page 65, the book got really excellent and drew me into it, so quite a long wait to be a good book. Unfortunately, the ending is a complete letdown of ill-thought-out philosophy that rambles on and on, almost seeming without end. The editor should have thrown the last 50 pages back to the author for a serious condensation"
3,Very disappointing,"I agree with one of the other reviewers 'ambivalent' is what I feel about this book. I was left confused and wanting to know (and understand) more about the background/social/political/cultural aspects of Earth in the 23rd century. I felt like I was reading a sequel and I was just supposed to know all about it already.There's really no action and the last 30-40 pages are a long dialogue explaining the motives of all the characters and the basic plot. Then it cuts off dramatically with not even an epilogue.It was interesting at times, the writing was good and the plot fairly original but it just didn't do anything for me."
4,Good product,"These are a little uncomfortable - the fabric is a little rough and plastic like. However, they look really great and it's hard to tell you're even wearing any hose - I wore these for my wedding to make my legs look great."
2,Leaves you hanging.,"Having read the Ramses series, which I couldn't put down until I had finished them, I was very dissappointed with this book. You are able to read the Ramses books individually and have a good story with an ending. With this book I feel as if the author has only published 1/4 of the book in order for us to buy the rest. I won't be! I was not carried back into time like the Ramses series, where I felt I was actually there. This book did not give me that feeling. At times I found it incredibally boring and long winded, it took me days to finish it, not hours. I'm glad I have actually been to the Valley of the Kings and Queens and the Nobles, so I could picture the setting, otherwise I would have been more confused than I already was by the book. If you have read the Ramses Series I don't recommend this book, if this is your first experience with Christian Jaqc, don't bother, read the Ramses series instead."
5,Excellent!,"This book is really amazing! The story is interesting and attractive. When you start reading the book you won't stop it till you finish. Although the vocabulary of this book is quite difficult, but I highly recommend this book to all of you, and I sure that you will love it! Don't forget to buy another 3!"
4,Luscious,"Very good record. Includes some of Liz's prettiest songs along with several that rock as expected. Not as much depth as Exile but a worthwhile addition to any collection, especially Liz fans."
2,a disappointment...not worth buying like her 1st two CDs,"I feel I got alot for my money with Liz Phair's first two CDs. Not so with her latest effort, ""Whitechocolatespaceegg.""""Exile in Guyville"" was, for the most part, full of short, enjoyable diamonds-in-the-rough. ""Whipsmart"" had fewer but more polished songs. I really enjoyed the first two.This latest CD, however, is a major disappointment. I can't help but think this was an effort to make quick $$$ out of rejects from her previous two efforts. Apart from the guitar ""hook"" on ""Uncle Alvarez"" there is nothing special on ""Whitechocolatespaceegg""..."
3,The album that grows on you,"When I first heard this album, I didnt think much of it. As a matter of fact, I listened to the first few tracks and then put it away for a month. But once I got the courage to listen to the entire cd, I found that the songs began to grow on me. I found myself humming some of the cathy but simple melodies in unexpected places. Liz makes up for her obvious lack of vocal talent buy using lyrics that can be understood and related to extreamly easily. I think I knew all the lyrics after listening to it just once. So all and all, Id say that this cd is not too bad."
2,"Um, Sheryl Crow's new album?","Exile was a masterpiece of rock. Now I probably should allow liz to expand her horizons and attack new ground. But this is too slick, clean, to sherly crow. no edge. I can't blame her for being happier, but the music is way too poppy and easy. I got bored with this adult contemporary crap pretty quickly. Two stars because there are a few good tracks but really, let's strip it down some. the production is what kills this album."
1,profoundly sophmoric,"Deeply meaningful Gen-X kitsch sung by a performer without a drop of talent in her body. The lyrics are so bad that laughter is the only defense, and Liz Phair's ""singing"" suggests that she may be suffering from a terminal combination of stomach ulcers and sinus infection.However, if you have seen her perform in person or on television you will know that listening to the CD is only the second worse torture this person could inflict on you.A fitting birthday present for someone you loathe."
1,Absolute drivel,"How the hell can anyone live with themselves after making this appalling pseudo pop-obscenity.Made with the accountants in mind, and one eye on her next major asset purchase, Liz sells out to the Man.I gotta go to the john."
1,Disappointing at best,"While her earlier efforts were spirited, raunchy and fun, this latest release falls short. Seems as though Liz has settled into the musical humdrums and (yikes!) she's even gone country-twangy on us! If you are expecting more of what Exile & WhipSmart had to offer, don't bother with this cd. I for one want the old, edgy, in-your-face Liz Phair back!"
3,Slightly Disappointed...,"I do love Liz Phair, but the songs on this album don't hit me like her other two albums. My mom and her fifty-year old friend like this album. Baby Got Going, Johnny Feelgood and White Chocolate Space Egg are my favourites - but the others don't really come close. Uncle Alvarez has a good beat - but it has lame lyrics (except for the ""sorry for the wall"" part). There are also no fast-paced catchy songs like there were on Guyville and Whip Smart. Liz, please don't lose all of your whip-smartness and hitch a plane back to Guyville as soon as possible - Your fans will like you better there than on this cracking White Chocolate Space Egg."
4,Bring It Back Brooklyn Bounce,I liked all the tracks. The Derb mix was particularly good hard house. The original track was a great start.
3,3.5 Stars,"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is CLASSIC HIP HOP, it's up there with Nas' Illmatic. If you don't have this album you deserve to be shot. A MUST HAVE."
3,Not Original LP Artwork,"Classic album, it's all there on the 2 LPs provided, but it didn't come with the original artwork - just a black LP sleeve. Doesn't denegrate the music in anyway and the production pops, RZA's drums detonate throughout. An annoyance as a big fan and vinyl collector to not have the artwork you envisioned, though."
5,f n classic WU TANG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Each member of the wu has had great solo albums . This one is no doubt raw, hard ,grimey n dark. Reakwon da chef just keeps his beats strong and raw-like wu tang did on the chambers. The album has a hardcore vibe and the best from the wu tang stylemy favourite songsCriminology - the beat is mean raw n ruff definelty pure wu tangcarscerated scarfaces - lyrically powerfuland others follow including rainey dayz . There also skits in which the cachty qoute of "" i dont want niggaz sounding like me on no album"" - which describes artist in rap who coppy each other. But this album is just ruggered n ruff - others out there are likebig l -lifestyle of the poor n dangerousbeatnuts-street levelmobb deep- infamousmethod man -ticaljust to name a few."
4,An important piece of the John Lyons Picture,"John teaches concept as much as technique and that is important. John encourages you consider broad principals and define your goals. Having participated in several symposiums and a clinic, most of everything I do was influenced by John Lyons and this book was an important part of that. The foundation for training my own Andalusian Stallion is largely based on concepts from this book. I believe you also need two important videos by John: ""Round Pen Reasoning"" and ""Leading and Loading"". John never claims to be the only enlightened trainer, but in my view he is one of the best. You can dedicate a lifetime to learning about horses, and this book is a great starter. But in the end, you will learn the most from your horse not from other books. I believe John would agree."
2,Poor quality,"I loved this dryer's concept: mounted on the wall. Very compact and looks nice. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long - less than a year of daily use. It doesn't work at all now."
1,Bad Product Horrible Customer Service,The headset worked fine for about 45 days then the microphone failed completely. The company does not even list this as a current product even though it is still being sold in a number of places. Website is terrible. They do not answer e-mail. You have to jump through a number of hoops and sit on hold forever just to get to someome who will let you send this back to them at your expense. Labtec will never see my money again!
5,YEA BABY!! HAPPY HARDCORE,"i love this cd! my ultimate fav song on this cd would have to be brisk and trixxy ""eye opener"" i love it! i listen to it like, three times in a row! i have a friend who hated techno and after listenin to this cd, she doenst bash it ne more! hahaha! happy 2b hardcore own!"
2,Well made and kinda sexy BUT...,"...couldn't get the hooks hooked! The panty part was easy to put on, i.e., no calisthenics were necessary. When I was halfway thru the hook/corset part, I had a whopper hot flash, my hands and arms were cramping... I had to sit and rest for a moment.... (I'm kidding - it wasn't that bad, but I honestly could not get the hooks hooked.) I'm an out-of-shape/flabby size 12 and bought size large; didn't think the XL would be 'controlling' (tight) enough. Purchased 2 and they both went back. If you have this problem, try Flexees #3918. It's not as 'pretty,' has no 'hooks' but it did tighten the flab and I don't break into a sweat when I put it on. And it made almost TWO INCHES disappear!"
2,flexees waistnipper,I was not able to use this item since it was much too small for a medium the size I always use. Item returned.
5,GREAT!,We use this in K to intro poetry and sight words. The kids do them at home for writing practice and to learn the words.
5,Great for Kindergarten,I like to use these poems with my kindergarteners throughout the school year. They love them as they are often repetitive and easy to read. The kids love reading them together as an entire class and then trying to read them individually (which most of them can do with practice!). ;-) Great purchase!
2,Not Up to Snuff,"I've read all the books in the series up to this one, and liked most very much. However, this one is disappointing. The author attempts to avoid most of the major battles that have so often been the background for other fictional British naval heroes, and instead place Lewery in little known clashes. This is to be commended. However, H.M.S. Cockerel suffers from a lack of action and in fact, struck me as rather boring. While I read the previous episodes cover-to-cover, I had no problem putting this one down. I would suggest the reader who is not following the antics of Lewery in episodic order revert to another title."
3,NOT HIS BEST,"I BOUGHT THIS HARDCOVER BOOK BASED ON THE REVIEWS HERE IN. DEWEYS OTHER BOOKS A LOT BETTER.IF YOU LIKE THE RISQUE, THIS BOOKS FOR YOU. VERY LITTLE SEA FARE.MOST DISTRACTING FOR ME IS DEWEYS CONSTANT BROKEN ENGLISH AND FRENCH. NOT BEING INTERESTED IN TRANSLATING HIS CONVERSATIONS.BUYER BEWARE, IF YOU CAN BORROW OR PAY A BUCK OR SO, OK. PROBABLY MY LAST DEWEY PURCHASE."
3,A Guy Flick with a Little for Women,"Mainly if you like fairly standard war footage, and enjoy watching jet fighter sequences, then you will like this standard formula war movie. Of course there is the 50's family side, and feel good moments. Just don't expect an Oscar performance, and you probably will be entertained. F-86's are one of my favorite fighters, so seeing them in their element makes it worth it for me."
2,"The McConnell Story (Full Length. 107 Minutes. Alan Ladd, June Allyson, James Whitmore)",The storyline is exactly perfect. Actors do it well.However this version was a direct conversion from video Cassette with all of tape inconsistancies and 'tape rolling'.I will wait until the WB version is realeased and try purchasing a good copy then.I have rated this here two stars only because of the storyline.
5,Works well!,Does exactly what it says. Easy to use. Very strong. I use it on my 140 gallon tank. This is my second one as I had lost my first one. I would highly recommend it!
5,Just saved our Powerbook G4 directories,"Great product. Just used to save everything we thought we had lost, following a run of Tech Tool 4. Worked for days trying to save files with Tech Tool tecnical support. Disk Warrior worked in a matter of minutes. What a relief."
1,Defective product,"I bought it Diskwarrior 3.0 after reading several reviews, what they don't tell you is that 3.0 does not work with 10.3, and that after you get it, you will have to to call the company and pay an additional $20 for a working product (3.01)."
5,dental floss for your Macintosh,"Diskwarrior is an essential utility for Mac OS X. I don't even wait til applications start quitting unexpectedly to use Diskwarrior. I even leave my Diskwarrior CD in the CD drive. I do a restart with the Diskwarrior CD and let it do it's thing to keep the directories in tip top shape as I start my day. After awhile, this becomes second nature..like brushing your teeth."
1,Just didn't work!,"Software just didn't even see my disk and so didn't even attempt to help - had to just wipe it using Disk Utility (which saw the disk just fine) and restore.Total waste of money - contacted Alsoft who make this huge deal about offering no-refunds, talk about a paranoid bunch who don't have faith in their own code."
1,Snake Oil,"There is a likelihood that you will soon have deep disappointment in Disk Warrior. With the intricacies of disk recovery, there will be instances where software can fix it and instances where it just can't. By not allowing someone to download and preview what is possible to be fixed (which would be the right thing to do) Disk Warrior is virtually assured to rip-off a great percentage of their purchasers. Then again, maybe you like throwing your money away."
3,"Good Overview of the Arthurian Legend, with some flaws","This is a useful anthology. If you want to learn some basics about the Arthurian legend, or if you want to teach a class on it, this is the best book to buy. It's fairly comprehensive, with the exception noted below, and the translations are readable, though seldom the best available. It's nice to see some of the unusual stories like ""The Saga of the Mantle"" and ""The Rise of Gawain.""The collection's major flaw is its omission of any Grail text. I have to supplement this book with Nigel Bryant's translation of Robert de Boron (Merlin and the Grail, from Boydell and Brewer). We could certainly do without all the Tristan and Isolde texts (which are only marginally Arthurian anyway). The other flaw, though less grave, is the paucity of the selection from Malory. He really deserves greater prominence than he gets in this anthology, and the selection without proper context isn't very compelling."
3,Good overview of Arthurian legends,"This book gives somewhat of a Arthurian anthology as it begins in the early writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth and others, then works its way through some of the more well known stories, most notably Knight of the Cart and Gawain and the Green Knight. The translations of the individual stories aren't always the best, but this book is a good compilation for casual readers of Arthurian lit looking for a sampler."
3,Not Quite,"This is an attractive way to cover a notebook and the actual notebook included is great looking on its own with perforated pages and a sleek, durable black cover (notebook sold at Kinko's btw). My only issue was that I have been in close networking situations when it was too big open, but not flexible enough to fold the cover over in half."
3,Where is the series headed?,"I have been a fan of Torie's from the first book. However, after finishing this one, I'm left wondering if the author wouldn't be better off wrapping things up here for the O'Sheas, and introducing a new protaginist; I wouldn't mind at all if that were Collette, by the way. I found the antics here a bit over-the-top, but don't want to say much more for fear of spoiling things. Much is made of Rudy's perceived ""henpecked"" (to use the polite term) status among the townspeople, but I had trouble buying into that based upon what we've seen in the series so far.One thing that wasn't addressed before, and is not in this book either: Colin lives in Wisteria and runs for New Kassel mayor!? Even *if* there were no actual residency requirement for that position, you'd think it'd be a huge issue nonetheless. I would really like to know whether other readers noticed this issue, and if so, did it bother you, too - or were you able to work around it to get through the story?"
3,A heartwarming film,"The Dove approved film featuring a little penguin named Scooter who learns the importance of self worth and love, and that everyone is truly unique and loved for who they are. When purchasing it you need to remember that this is a low budgeted film so while it may not be as wonderful as Happy Feet in terms of animation, the message that it delivers and the opportunity to talk to your children about the importance of acceptance is worth the purchase in itself."
1,what the h?*!@?,"Can anyone tell me if they have tried the ""stunningly simple placemats""? On page 107. With 8 easy directions I can't imagine how it could go wrong but this pattern does not work!! How can the frame pieces possibly be cut the same length as the main mat piece and be large enough to frame it???!@#!!I am very fustrated since I have cut up all my fabric at this point and the frame pieces are too small! This is the 1st and last project I will try in this book."
5,Works great!!!,"This product works great, made the glossy look return to my Sailboat and as with any good wax you do have to put some elbow grease into it."
3,way too neo-classical,"This album reminded my of listening to Yngwie Malmsteen back in the 80s - the same rehashed classical type solos . Yeah, both Greg and Vitalig (keyboardist) are great musicians, but the choruses on this are awful (not catchy) and I've grown to hate the neo-classical genre. Nothing special here. Skip this one."
1,Not Impressed - Poor Quality!,I was not impressed at all with this product - very poor quality. The base is not very sturdy and you really have to hold on to it when straining fruits through it. The bottom piece of the cone also broke off the very first time I used it so I am returning it and getting a better quality one. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone ... they really should redesign it so that the cone part is all one piece!
4,Applesauce-maker!!,I bought this contraption b/c it reminded me of one my parents had years ago!! It worked well and my applesauce turned-out YUMMY!!
2,Fox Run Three Piece Stainless Steel Chinois Set,"I you are envisioning the huge light weight aluminum ""china cap/chinois"" that grandma had...this is not it LOL! This one is 7 inches tall, 7 inches around. It works very well and fits into a large cooking pot; no need to strain foods in another container and then transfer to a pot. I love the stand rim design...slotted so the handle of the chinois does not slip around while you are working! This is very sturdy stainless steel construction and a bit heavier than grandma's old aluminum set; it is designed to last!"
2,Annoying design,"I bought these to replace my iPod ear buds and was sorely disappointed in them. The sound is decent, but in order to actually hear your music without turning the volume way up, you need to actually press the earphones against your ear as it's impossible to get a snug fit. I'm also utterly confused by the need for the right headphone to be attached to the left headphone - it's just replacing a wire hanging in front of you with a wire hanging behind you. I'm taking these back today and looking for something else."
4,"An excellent album, but not as good as their first.","In my opinion, this album isn't as good as their first, ""That's Business."" But it all depends on what you like. If you're into Ska-Punk more than straight Punk, you'd probably want the first one. But if you're into Pop-Punk, you'd probably want to get this album. Still, it's an album worth having -- especially with songs like ""All That You Have"" with its nice blend of Ska and Punk, ""Grow Up"" with its angry lyrics, and ""Wow, She Dumb"" with its peppy music and humorous lyrics."
2,"OKay, but NOT punk","lets get one thing straight. these guys are NOT punk (punk = bad religion, nofx, rancid, black flag). they're not even pop-punk (pop-punk = ramones, buzzcocks, green day). this brand of childish, hook-laden garbage is called POWER-POP. its pop with guitars. so all you little n*sync fans who think you're making the ""big crossover"" into punk rock need to think again. yeah, okay, some of the songs are catchy, but is that all that makes music good??????"
5,"""Act your Age"" is the best album that I have ever bought","I first heard Homegrown this summer, when they were touring with Blink 182. I thought that they were better than Blink and the crowd there seemed to agree. I went out the next day and bought ""Act Your Age,"" and it was the best $12 I ever spent. Four months later I still listen to the CD all the time."
3,Decent Reference Book But Poor Quality,I obtained a copy of this book for fifty dollars. For that price the quality of the print was acceptable. The tabels and formulas in this book are quite thorough and so far have proven to be a better source than Wikipedia.
2,Poor Quality,"While this board erases pretty easily, it has fallen off of the wall numerous times. I am not sure whether it was damaged during shipping or not, but it seems to be a little bit bent and falls off of the wall almost every time I have tried to write on it. Also, the tray for the markers falls off very easily. The worst part of this board is that the dry erase surface is not attached flat to the back, aluminum surface making it difficult to write on as it is uneven."
1,Poorly packaged,"The packaging uses a glue that cannot be easily removed from the whiteboard. Definitely a candidate for the Darwin Award. The whiteboard comes pre-ruined because of this glue. Smart move, Quartet."
1,Not what I expected . . .,"I was quite disappointed to find that the album contained remakes of my favorite Atlanta Rhythm Section songs. They're not bad, but I wanted the original versions--wished they had mentioned that they weren't somewhere on the cover. I can't recommend buying this album."
4,"This book explores what the ""art of medicine"" means","As a primary care physician old enough to have experienced the deficiencies of fee-for-service payment, the attenuation of relationships induced by technology, and the intrusions of ""managed care,"" I resonate with Dr. Cassell's return to ""the basics,"" the primacy of the personal engagement between two unique individuals, and how it must predominate regardless of the overlying system. It is unfortunate that the publisher failed to match Dr. Cassell's attention to detail with their own. Mispellings, errors in punctuation, and simply sloppy proofreading abound. These defects constitute a serious, though nonfatal, shortcoming."
2,150 SCI-FI TV CLASSICS,"I just bought 150 SCI-FI TVI didn't get ""Here comes Tobor"" or ""Mandrake the magician"" I got a ""Clutch Cargo"" instead. I would rather have the those missing episodes. I did get 150 episodes total"
5,First use on a Tile Job....,"It came in the mail while I was on vacation, first day back I was scheduled to start a tile job. Not too much time for a learning curve! I unboxed it and was immedately impressed with the heft. It comes in its own zipper nylon soft case which I was not expecting [bonus!] I can keep a few related tools in there with it along with a spare skoring wheel. I brought a few old practice tiles with me to get familiar with the tool, quickly realized it takes four good passes with the wheel to insure a clean cut every time. With that said the first day I was home an hour early and did not have to use my wet saw once all day. DAY ONE: highly recommended! I will keep you all posted on how it holds up after longer usage."
4,A progressive classic for the new age!,"This book has helped me so much with my grammar. Really! I were flunking out of college English so my friend said to me, ""You should get this book - it is really good"" and so I got the book and boy was she right it really helped me with my run on sentences and the other problems I was having like not knowing, how to use, commas and stuff."
5,for all who like to laugh,"I bought extra copies of this book for Christmas gifts.We are a family of writers, and one seldom (or never) findsa useful punctuation guide that is funny.Before I gave it away, I read this book at night just before fallingasleep--to help bring good dreams."
1,Flimsy and flat,"What a dull book, with a dull premise. The ladylike heroine and the rakish man has been done to death at this stage. There is no spark between the characters apart from the kiss, no sensuality, and dozens of characters mentioned never to be seen again. I find that the other couples in the book are all more interesting than the central one, which is not saying much since even Anne the heroine finds them dull. And crippled heroines have been done to death at this stage as well, as has the innocent and niave girl who asks a rake for tutelage in love.I also saw so many grammatical errors in this book that the whole thing struck me as slipshod and yet another book churned out to try to continue a successful series at the expense of commonsense and quality."
1,No hazard here,"I was charmed that the book was dedicated to the late Dorothy Dunnett. Would that the book had even a hint of Lady Dunnett's verve. A flat, not particularly interesting story."
5,Very cool tool,I bought this to clean the fish tank glas.... It is a very strong magnet and makes cleaning the inside glass very easy without having to have a long brush and getting water all over the place.
5,"Addictive, easy to play violent fun","Not sure why this addictive, fun, easy to play shooter-upper hasn't gotten more press. Gorgeous graphics, innovative weapon design, and smooth rendering are just some of Darkwatch's features. I also love the whole ""Spaghetti Western meets a Zombie Flick"" mashup going on. I was at the launch party for this title and I was sure it would rise to the top. The only thing keeping this one down is media noise from the other big title games. I would definitley give this one a try if you like FPSs that don't waste a lot of your time with tedious zillion-step puzzles that necessitate level repeats."
3,Decent.,"Wouldn't call it great, just decent. I had alot of fun with this, but there's no denying that there are better shooters out there. If your curious just try it, it's pretty cheap now might as well."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed when this dress came. Very see through and shear, not at all the quality I expected."
5,Wonderful!,I was skeptical about ordering this dress after reading the reviews but I ordered it anyway and it was the best decision I made. The dress was just as beautiful in person as in the picture. It's not as full on the bottom as I thought but I love it either way! The best part is that I received the dress within 5 days of ordering it. I love love love it! My flower girl is going to look beautiful on my wedding day.
1,Never Again...,"Okay, so at least the other reviewers got a month out of their Plextor 716A. I didnt get a day out of it. I purchased it in February, but didnt unpack it and install it until August. Everytime I tried to burn a cd, i would get an error message. I tried using Roxio, and another CD writing program, and i would get errors from both. I tried switching the jumper from Cable Select, to Master, and then to Slave, nothing. Since I'm fairly familiar with technical issues (by no means an expert), first I refered to the manual that came with it. No luck, they dont give you anything to go on in their ""troubleshooting"" section. So then I figured I'd go online, and again the online ""support"" and ""Troubleshooting"" is of zero help.I did NOT buy it from amazon, but I should have looked here for the reviews first, and I definitely would not have purchased it! I wont buy a Plextor again..."
3,CONFUSED!,"This EQUUS model #6088 tachometer will NOT work with my 2-cylinder HONDA motorcycle; the installation instructions on the buyers page, were for a different model tach; the back of the model 6088, has a 3-way switch, you set it to choose 4,6, or 8 cylinder. This plastic housing tach is probably a good deal under $35. Amazon could save me a return by posting a picture of the back of the tach showing this. Thanks"
3,Ok but not glued well,"Product came with the base not glued on -- instead of sending it back and hassling, I just glued it on myself using liquid nails. Overall product looks good."
3,a mild disappointment,"this album is a regression. gone are the spontaneous first-take wonders of bone machine and the black rider--in their place: a self-conscious, clastrophobic feel to songs that are, for the most part, simply not up to par. i've never heard waits sound this uninspired, with only pony and georgia lee managing to temporarily break this album's murky, tiresome spell. big in japan sounds like tom waits doing an impersonation of tom waits--in other words, it's dangerously close to parody. here's hoping his muse accepts the roses he's sent and starts sleeping with him again...."
5,amazing!,"i agree the first track is horrid, but the rest of the album is immensely listenable. the collection includes some hearbreaking simple ballads, a hilariously twisted approach to the body of christ, a whale-song accompanied jazzy thing, a spoken-word paranoia study which sounds like orson welles.... and enough atmospheric sounds to put us firmly into a dusty depression-era netherworld. the final track wraps everything up joyously."
4,One of Waits' and 1999's best...,"This is Tom Waits' most accessible, musical and optimistic album in years... that's not to say that it really is any of those things except compared to other of his albums. His voice sounds the best I can ever recall. Some wonderful songs are here ranging from the funny ""Big in Japan"" to the disconcerting and mysterious- what IS he building in there anyway? It's not for everyone- my wife hates it and friends often flinch listening to it. If you have an ear or at least tolerance for discordant music and want a postmodern musical look at our culture you should give this a listen."
4,"I'm gonna love you, 'till the wheels come off...","This album is probably a good starting place for people unfamiliar with Waits. Some call it a rehash, but it is more a tribute. Some of his most hilariously deranged pieces flaunt themselves in full colors (Big In Japan, Eyeball Kid...), and some of his most touching ballads ever will be working your tear glands."
5,"Yup, it's an effort indeed","Tom Waits' first REAL album release in six years sounds much more down to earth than, say for example, ""Rain Dogs"". Maybe it's the move to the countryside, maybe it's Tom getting older, I don't know, but it sure as hell sounds great... It's actually among his very best. Listen to songs like ""Hold On"", ""Hous Where Nobody Lives"", ""Cold Water"", ""Pony"", ""Eyeball Kid"", ""Picture In A Frame"", ""Chocolate Jesus"" or ""Georgia Lee"" and you can understand why he is concidered to be one of the most talented -if not THE most talnted - songwriters of our time. There's just so much humility and warmth in his songs. Especially the lyrics are genious in some places, and the sympathic sound of the instuments make their sound even more cosy. This is the best album of the last year of the second millenium. Ain't that something!"
4,Madman Poet by Way of the Oregon Trail,"It was about time. Finally after a lengthy time away from us, the madman has returned with a vengeance. Here he has crafted a deeply moving ( Hold On) and deeply hysterical (Filipino Box Spring Hog) album. Tom swings from power chords to soft crooning like only he can. Let me go no further without mentioning Tom's voice. Frankly it sounds as though he's drinking whiskey that's as old as Damascus and gargling rusty nails in between drinks. The interesting thing is that Tom's voice always manages to capture exactly what he's trying to accomplish. Don't rush out and buy this album because you saw The Heart of Saturday Night or Rain Dogs in your Dad's records. Tom Waits is an acquired taste. The songs have obvious flaws, but that is what makes them so memorable. This one will stand up quite well in Tom's catalogue."
2,not worth a penny,well let me start by stating that this so call enhancer does nothing to your body but pain when i started taking it on two or three days i began noticing a pain below on my part like where the prostate is located and immediately i stop using it i though that maybe it was something else and tried again several weeks later to get the same pain again so i discard it
2,Nowhere near on par with the rest of the series.,"While I enjoyed the other books of the series, I found this title to be lacking.Almost every aspect of the story seemed rushed, or not worthy of being written.Origins that dont go deep enough to truly explain the charactors, storys that mearly show an event in the charactors lives, or storys that are pretty much exatcly as you would expect them to be without need for explanation (arseface).I regret purchasing the title"
5,Finding Destiny,"Finding Destiny is a great novel for anyone who wants to be inspired, uplifted and encouraged. Everyone can relate to this coming of age tale filled with both blessings and disappointments. Finding Destiny is an easy read, and a definite page turner.You won't want to stop reading until the last word."
5,"If You're Not Irish - You Will Be, After You Hear This!","This recording, is most likely the BEST overall compilation of Irish Standards, ever! I mainly purchased it, to hear 10 (out of 23)songs by John Gary, who voice carries you to Ireland on the wings of angels. Rounding out this recording are Dennis Day and Leo McCaffrey, whose Irish tenor voices also take us back to another place and time. This is the ULTIMATE recording for St. Patrick's Day or for any other day you'd like to sit back and relax and visit Ireland...if only in your mind and heart."
3,Mediocre,"Maybe I'm being too critical here. I mean, I like Jon Miller. He's an excellent broadcaster. He certainly knows his baseball. But can he write? The answer (even with assistance) is, disappointingly, no. He has some good anecdotes, and makes some good points, but as I was reading it, I couldn't help wondering, ""Where is this book going?"" The answer is nowhere. It's meandering and disjointed. He makes all of his ""controversial"" points in the first chapter, but then offers nothing to back up his theses later in the book. Still, if you want to learn about Jon Miller, to read some interesting stories about the colorful players and broadcasters Miller has encountered over the years, AND get a defense in of Miller's decision to leave the broadcasting booth for the Baltimore Orioles, then go ahead and buy the book. But, perhaps you would feel you're getting your money's worth if you waited for the paperback version or maybe borrowed it from your local library."
5,The best Yorkie book ever written,"When Bill writes of his experiences with Smoky it feels as though you are right there along side both of them,experiencing what they are going through.Well written and he even gives you training tips to train your dog with.Yorkie doodle dandy is a must have for any family library.Way to go Bill and thanks for bringing Smoky back for us all to enjoy!!!"
5,"Much better than The Tunnel, this mixtape has good beats","Funkmaster Flex's first mix tape is much better than his later ones. The beats are great. Method Man, Redman, Fugees, Mobb Deep, you name it some of the biggest hip hop groups are featured on here. The beats on this album are excellent. This is definetly a must have for any fan of Flex or rap."
1,Pantyhose had snags when they arrived,"First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last! I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 ""runs"" in one of the legs before I even tried them on. What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product!"
1,Don't Purchase! Poor Quality! Will NOT Buy Again,"These stockings are made of inferior quality and craftsmanship.Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can say positively about them. Truly sad.When my wife tried them on for the first time - they ran!The nylon is so horribly thin they don't put up with much handling at all.Don't Waste Your Hard Earned Cash.Very Poor QualityBuy Another ProductSave Your Money For Something Better"
1,wrong item,"I did not get this item, i got some thing differentwas not worth sending back, it was a gift"
5,I'm pleased with the book.,"I knew the book was a used one, but I couldn't have got it anywhere else.I'm very pleased with the book because it is like a new one.Thanks a lot."
4,Anakin Skywalker,I think we all know the main reason we watch this abridged version of star wars because we wanna see anakin. Come on he is the best hes the reaosn I even like the star wars. That episode when he protected ahsoka from that explosion was epic. In this season they barely showed anakin at all and if this continues I will not be watching this garbage.
4,Good but a little darker,Have enjoyed the series. This season gets a little darker and would be careful showing it to younger kids. I personally find them to be a little expensive. Still a fan though.
2,Menu does not work,"This blue ray does not work with 2011 panasonic blue ray player .... You can not select episodes , justbplaybthe whole Disc..."
5,"Very good item for anyone, Received quickly","Enjoy this item, worth the time to watch, all seasons. Great for all ages that are Star Wars fans, fun...."
4,Clone Wars Season 4,Great Show.....Keep up the good work on the next seasons and action figures coming from the show on Cartoon network
5,Keeps getting better!,"We would recommend this DVD to any Star Wars fan. Plenty of high-paced action, good story arcs and plenty of secrets revealed. A must see."
4,A little disappointing,The movie was a little disappointing. We had hoped for so much more information but it just wasn't there. The scenery was spectacular and I did learn about the Galapagos but it did not live up to what I was hoping for.
3,For Preliminary use only!,"This book will give you a basic understanding of the type of material you will need to know in order to pass the series 7. However, the keyword is basic. It is in no way in depth enough. Do yourself a favor and get the real thing. I have used two other study programs and they are MUCH, MUCH better(American Investment Training and Securities Training Inc). They do cost a pretty penny (about $200) but are well worth it. As far as the CD is concerned, don't waste your time with it. Many of the answers are wrong and it does not provide explanations."
2,Scratches plastic tank,"I use this magnetic cleaner with great effect on my 45 gallon glass tank, but if you are looking to clean the sides of a plastic tank, do not purchase this product. It leaves small scratches on the inside of the plastic with every pass--it's just too abrasive for plastic tanks."
4,Works really well,This worked really well. Doesn't get corners much and you have to work on those hard but for the most part this works great and you don't have to get your hands wet.
5,love it,i had some cheap magnet cleaner before that had felt or some fabric on it and it didn't last long at all. this one is great and is put together much better. i can tell this thing will be around for awhile. does a great job so far.
1,I hadn't received it yet after two months.,Very poor service. I had not received yet after approximately two months of purchase. I have not received either a reason of the delay. What is going on ?
3,excepted more,On overcast days the readings are not accurate. Recharging doesn't always work. connection is not strong. Am dsappointed in the results.
2,Dissappointed with content,"Maybe I'm too persnickety, but I was so dissappointed by the content of the songs. I'd hoped for some cute childhood rhymes, but instead found a bunch of rubbish, to put it nicely."
3,You Get What You Expect,"This is a typical James Bond flick which means a lot of good things and some bad ones but at least, if you're a fan of the series, you get what you expect.In other words, you get outrageous action scenes, Rambo--like mentality, a wild and fun villain, a ""hot"" female lead helping Bond, a bunch of sexual innuendos, a hokey-but- interesting story and some outstanding opening credits. I never had any complaints with Pierce Brosnan playing Bond. I thought he very credible in the role, sincerely macho and debonair at the same time. Halle Berry was at her peak, so male viewers had no complaints watching here. She wasn't in here just for looks; she was in fighting shape, too.Is the story far-fetched? Yeah, a little! Ludicrous? You bet. Entertaining? Sure. Who watches these films for their intelligence?"
2,The Worst Bond Yet? - Die Another Day,"With 19 other films under its belt I would of thought that the producers should of known better.Rather than making this film a gritty character peice - as promised to the fans - they opt to create a film in which they give us a great story set up, which goes on to develop into the largest mix of cheesy set and action peices that I have seen since Moonraker - with the acception of Batman & Robin.Computer graphics (poor ones at that) have now replaced creative stunt work, to give us overly elaborate and ultimatly boring action sequences, why don't they just brake down and make a CGI Bond movie?The two stars that I give this film are for nostalgia reasons - and for that for the first hour I thought that I was in for a fun Bond experience.The powers that be have forgotton that Bond fans hate Moonraker for a very good reason - I hope they realize their mistake, and redeliver."
2,Just die today,"This was the first James Bond that I ever watched, and sadly my last. James Bond is nothing more than a womanizer, and not a good spy to boot. The two and half hours on this movie are definantly a waste as James Bond seduces girl after girl, and tries to capture a man who is as poor an enemy as he is spy.I thought the movie was full of acting, acting you can tell is acting which made the movie longer. Besides, the chase scenes where just as boring. The hover crafts promised to be cool, but only managed to become drab and uninteresting after the first five minutes.In short, James Bond will never win my heart nor my vote of popularity in this review.Oh, well, he'll just have to try another day."
1,What Are You People Talking About?,"This movie apparently has a lot of vocal fans, but dont let that fool you. This is a terrible movie. The movie rambles on for far to long with ""action"" sequences that get old very fast. James Bond gets captured and tortured. What is that? My final problem with this, and all other Brosnan Bond movies, is the Bad Guy. Why do they have to be lame. A bald guy who is entirely covered in metal flake silver paint isnt scary, its lame."
2,I expected a little more_ _ _,The graphics of this movie are quite good but it is not the best 007 movie i've ever seen.Brosnan's acting in this is okay but the story is predictable.So don't waste your money cause you'd rather prefer you would rather prefer Tnd(tommorow never dies)
2,The worst Bond Film,"This is by far, the worst Bond Movie that has ever been produced (with the exception of Never Say Never Again.) Not only does it stray from the Original Roots of the James Bond Series, it takes place in a futuristic setting that hurts the movie. The movie does have some good scenes, but most of them are the ones that follow the pattern of the old James Bond Movies. Pierce Brosnan is a good Bond Actor, and he was great in the other three movies he made, and if this is his last Bond movie, I am sorry to see him go in this film. In all this movie takes number 20 in the list of Bond films, and I hope that the next one can save the series from Dying another day."
1,"Great Action Movie, Terrible Bond Movie","I went and saw this movie opening night. I saw the opening logo (gun-barrel logo), and thought this is going to be great. The opening logo, and maybe the underground tunnel with the old gadgets, was as close to a BOND movie as they got.The movie lacked it's usually bond qualities. I heard the BOND theme by Monty Norman played once I believe. Femme Fatatales were certainly there, but they also lacked the BOND punch. My biggest problem was that, I had trouble convincing myself that I was watching JAMES BOND. It was just an action flick with Pierce Brosnan to me.I thought before that the other BOND'S were far-fetched, but at least they were somewhat believeable. This film was almost totally sci-fi/techno/space-age garbage. Invisible cars? Robotic suits? Ice castles? Windsurfing on a sea of ice?JAMES BOND WILL RETURN!Thank God! I'm glad this wasn't the last BOND film. Hopefully they'll bring back more of the good ol' JAMES BOND for the next film."
2,The worst Bond film I've ever seen,"I will say it now, I haven't seen ALL the Bond films. I recently became determined to do so, hence why this was on the slate. I think I'm up to 15 or so.If I had to compare this to anything, it's the ""Schumacher's Batman & Robin"" of the Bond series; that is to say, a cartoonish shell of our beloved hero. This isn't Bond -- it's pure fantasy, begging far too much of the imagination, which is saying a lot considering the trademark of all Bond films of being over-the-top.Brosnan is fine, and so is Berry. The problem lies in the script and production design. While there is a few good scenes, few are memorable. The opening sequence is terrible (especially the title song), the villian forgettable, the gadgets are more like Michael Bay's wet dream.Short of being a die-hard fan, this one can be easily ignored."
3,Not too good,"I like Pierce Brosnan, I like him as james Bond, but then I also liked Timothy Dalton. I don't think that the series is old but the schemes are. Jinx played by Halle Berry and she plays it with energy and there's a point where it looks liek she may be an equal. Then they go after the villain at an ice hotel, no really, it does exist, the whole place is made out of ice, and she gets imprisoned in a room. Thats where the movie fell apart for me. She can't get out of the room. She's the American equivalent of James Bond and she can't get out of an ice room? Thats when the movie really becomes bad.You can't have someone built as an equal and then have her become the damsel in distress. Madonna's appearance is fun but she's not given a lot to work with, though the name Verity is cool.So in the end this film, while slick, with lots of special effects, sags because James Bond is so perfect and everyone else is fallible."
1,Only Halle Barry makes this flick worthwhile.,"This is probably one of the weakest attempts at an Ian Fleming theme. I kept thinking , ""If only Bond could have been enrolled in marksmanship classes this movie would have taken 5 minutes to reach a conclusion."" Meanwhile, you have Halle Barry for eye candy so it does have some redeeming qualities but is not my favorite James Bond attempt - give me Sean Connery any day! Even Hugh Grant would have been more believable than Pierce Brosden. For collector maybe but not notable as an action flick and is definately lacking in plot."
2,pass this one,"This movie is terrible even by bond standards, what was Halle berry thinking? She looks awful in this movie, add some lousy dialogues and a plot that parallels Mission Impossible, you have 'Die Another Day'.Pierce Brosnan is at his worst, He looks totally out of shape.But the music was the worst in this movie, David Arnold showed some promise in Tommorrow Never Dies. But they should start with somebody different, or even go back to Eric Serra.The reason i give this 2 stars is cos, the movie is worth watching just for the 'Aston Martin'. and that too half the time, the damn thing is invisible:)Overall, definitely not worth $..."
1,Another killer Satellite!,"After Tommorrow, and World is not enough I though this would be a great film, wrong. The CG effects were terrible. I am also getting tired of a satellite being in the plot line(remember Goldeneye), Bond going rougue is another rehash. Halle Berry was under used in this film. Lines like yo mamma just make her character sound silly. IMO the worst Bond Film. Although he is good in this film, Pierce hasen't had a good film to work with since Goldeneye. Here's hoping Bond 21 is better."
3,DIE ANOTHER DAY WAS PRETTY GOOD,I WAS A HALLE FAN AND THAT WAS WHY I WATACHED IT. BUT IT WAS OVER A GOOD ACTION MOVIE
3,Are they really that desperate?,"Every movie is the same now. A guy trys to destroy the world while Bond and a chick try to save it. This is movie 20 I believe. They really lost it though. Pierce is getting too old for this, and it is obvious that he has no material to work off of."
3,Ho-Hum,"What do you get when you sink all your money into special effects and nothing into the plot or writing? You get ""Die Another Day."" While the movie is tolerable, it has got to be one of the worst Bond movies ever. We're talking Timothy Dalton bad. I understand the bond movies are a formula and there have been some really good Bond movies, this just isn't one of them. If you are a Bond fan or collector of Bond movies then I say go ahead and get this, otherwise rent it if you want to see it."
4,"This movie is Better, than Bad...","I really like Bond movies, I started watching them since Pierce Bronsan started off as Bond in ""Golden Eye"", sad to here Bronsan want be in the next Bond movie. He quoted "" I believe myself to be too old to play Bond"". I really wish he would have atleast stayed for one more Bond movie, sadly that want be the case, unless miricles happen. Anyway, I have all four Bond DVD's leading up to this one, and I'm glad I bought them. To me its worth adding to your collection.I do agree with one or two of the earlier reviews, the end seem to be not as good as the first and somewhat the middle part. But it was'nt all that bad. I gave this movie (4) stars because its not perfect, but its pretty dang close. I reccommend you buying this DVD if your a close to or a die hard fan of Bond movies. Its worth adding to your collection..."
1,I am a LIFE LONG BOND FAN,"I am a life long bond fan, and for the first time in my history I can admit that I actually wanted James Bond to die at the end of this film. I was so disapointed.This is the first bond film ever made completly off scene. which means It was all made in hollywood and man can you tell! The movie lacks the good old fashon bond feel. it doesn't feel like the good old adventure bond used to go on, the movie doesn't take you anywhere and is only loaded with numerous sexual references (more so than any other bond film and they are very chessy). The only thing this movie has to offer is a bunch of explosions. SAVE YOUR MONEY and rent an OLD BOND MOVIE."
2,Fakiest thing since Britney's chest!,"Yeah, Bond can surf and flip a car with missels being launched. Bond surfing reminded me of watching ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" in the old days. The great blue screen affect. Don't take me wrong I love the old Bond films but this one is cheesey and ""oh my god get me a bucket"" dramatized. I know, I know it's entertainment not a movie. I know not a movie."
1,Junk. The series is already dead.,"Dumb explosions, silly dialogues, no character development, no BOnd's typical charm and charisma. Nothing of that. They simply destroyed the character, in the name of making a ""modern"" action thriller, that's completely avoid of feeling, emotion and respect for the character's history in the movies. Unbeliavable how the parents (in this case, the producers) can kill their own child (in this case, the Bond admired franchise)."
1,Definitely not for Bond fans,"This is definitely not a Bond movie. It completely lost the charm and elegance that used to caracterise the earlier movies.All in all, it just feels like an expensive Hollywood movie made to entertain you for an hour and then forget about it. So keep in mind that this movie cannot even be remotely associated any other James Bond's. It's stands on it's own and must be kept on the shelf between Rambo and Batman. If you can abstract from the fact that this was suppose to be a James Bond movie, then you might have a good time and not feel cheated and resentful of who made it."
1,Die Another Day - Are you sure??,"Seems dead already. Very disappointed with this Bond movie. Bad everything including very poor selection of Bond girls. I think GoldenEye was Brosnan's best and in my opinion the best made Bond movie so far but this one surely hurts Brosnan as Bond. Perhaps more appealing to the newer Generation of Bond fans but for older fans, this one [was the worst] big time."
1,Horrible...just horrible,"One of the worst movies ever, and definitely the worst BOND movie ever, Die Another Day is like watching a boat sailing across the ocean....and slowly it starts sinking, and sinking, until the whole things just falls into the ocean and everyone in the boat dies. I felt like one of those people in the boat.I couldn't believe how bad the acting was (Please, Madonna in a movie at ALL is bad enough), how silly the SPECIAL EFFECTS were....you would of thought that they would of least made an effort to make it seem realistic to maybe help soften the blow of such a silly plot and bad casting.Halle Berry once again amazes me with her horrifying acting abilities. That's right, Halle, just keep walking down the beach in that skimpy bikini and everyone will call you great.If you're bored and want to watch some junk, this is for you."
4,Brilliant movie,"Enjoyable James Bond film--one of the best. The opening credits and special effects are brilliant, as well as the fitting song ""Die Another Day"" performed by Madonna. Halle Berry is, of course, a babe as evident from her first scene opener. The plotline is solid and the acting is humorous but never cheesy. Overall, a thoroughly entertaining film."
3,Suspend your intelligence...,"This movie has some incredible special effects, great fight scenes, interesting plot and great villains. However, the special gadgets this time around are just a little too far outside the realm of possibility. An invisible car...give me a break. A resort constructed of ice...yeah, when h*ll freezes over.Of course with any Bond film, you're asked to suspend some degree of reality -- usually the fight scenes, but in this one you definitely have to ignore your sense of science. While I don't mind cooperating, this one asks a little much of its audience."
2,Bondian Deja Vu,"The James Bond series reaches another crossroads with ""Die Another Day"" (2002). Despite some new wrinkles to the rather tired 007 formula, the reliance on computer-generated effects makes the film look like a cartoon. Pierce Brosnan remains a solid Bond, with a memorable assist from Halle Berry as Jinx. However, the actors and director Lee Tamahori are shortchanged by a weak script. ""Die Another Day"" offers some nice homages to previous Bond films, but cannot escape the overall sense of deja vu. Brosnan's 007 deserved a better finale and his recent criticisms about the franchise were justified."
4,Bond meets Mr. Faulty,"This is an excellent Bond movie with great stunts, plenty of action and of course the women.A lot was made of Hale Berry she was interesting and a good character but didn't take over the movie as suggested.I'm really getting sick of M being played for a fool in these movies. This never happened before Ms Dench took the Job.The sword fight in the center was quite awsome and I didn't recognize Madona dressed she should try it more often.Bond Locked up for over a year was interesting.However this movie hit a brick wall for me when John Cleese came on the screen. Cleese plays Q as Basil Faulty and the result is SO good and SO funny that it frankly eclipses the rest of the movie. I find myself smiling just thinking about it.There is an excellent comic moment at the end tangently involving Cleese as well. Both of those scenes are worth the price of the movie."
2,Maybe the next one will be good,"Worst Bond film in the Brosnan series. Hally Berry was awful. You would have to be a serious Bond fan to praise this mess. Good special effects as usuall. Other then that, crap !"
1,absolutly the worst bond film,"i don't know why anyone likes this one. bad villians, a terrible plot, the worst theme song, and way too much action. i've seen every bond movie at least 10 times each and this is defenitly the worst one."
5,Stick Around Awhile & 'Die Another Day',"I'm a Bond buff and am looking forward to the release of #20 in the theaters. I have seen alot of advertisement on this newestadventure and have no reason to doubt it will be a smash hit. Ibelieve Pierce Brosnan is truly cut out for Ian Flemings character. Halle Berry ought to be a notable addition to this film, supported by Brosnan as well as Brit's Judi Dench, John Cleese and Samantha Bond. But it is going to be difficult notseeing 'my main man' Q (Desmond Llewellen) who, since his deathwill be greatly missed by HMSS, the fans and fellow actors. Isincerely hope a tribute of some kind will be presented on hisbehalf. Madonna should do very good singing the title song, andI read she has a bit part as well. I hear a brandnew Ford T-Birdwill be featured. Bravo, I'm not too keen on the Euro machinesanyway. BRING ON THIS AGELESS ACTION ADVENTURE HERO....!!"
4,What A Shame,"This was the best WRITTEN Bond that I have seen during the Brosnan reign. The storyline had twists and turns and a couple character surprises that re-engaged the viewer after the routine car/hover craft chases and overload of digital effects.The players were all good excepting Halle Berry. She was hard to watch. One can just imagine a NASDAQ feed with her lines running across her forehead. Line reader - not actor. Also it seemed that she modeled either her body, or the clothes that she wore in every scene that she was in. Yawn. Clearly she never got a firm grasp, or any for that matter, on her part as Michelle Yeoh did in Tomorrow Never Dies.Too bad (for the writers). In the 40th year of Bond most of the regulars seemed tired, leaving us with a disillusioned and drinking M. One can see why the producers went backwards in time and re-energized the franchise with a new Bond. It was time."
2,suffers from monotony,"CS is an interesting mix of folk and roots inspired music, but it both lives and dies by mediocre song selection, monotonous vocals and limited (definitely NOT untalented, though) instrumentation. I admittedly enjoyed the first listen, but the sound wears a little thin afterwards. The vocals tend to be the same whispering stuff that AKrauss has been doing the last decade. Many folks will love this, but I keep wanting more from this band....more harmonies, more drive and more interesting songs."
3,not as good as the latest.,"not bad tho-. my fave track is ""Photogragh"". about the only one i like. still has the grungy feel to it. all you college rockers and alternative freaks should enjoy this one. rock on!"
5,"It is, with no doubt, the best CD I own!","From ""The Freshman"" to ""Veneer"", this CD totally rocks! And who says the songs are to short?! It doesnt matter if the songs or short or lengthly, this CD is my favorited CD I own, and which has stayed in my mind! Also, if you want an excellent CD (in which the songs are short,) Marcy Playgrounds self-titled CD is therefore an excellent choice. Anyways, if you like a mix of excellent guitars, singing, and lyrics, and well just about everything, this CD would be an excellent choice!"
1,Save your money!!!,"I bought this cd cause I liked the Freshman. I now listen to soundclips online first. This is the worst cd. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Once you get tired of the Freshman, the most fun you can have with the cd is to burn it!"
5,The Rock says know your role & buy this cd,"Having seen some other reviews for this album ,The Rock can't believe that some people gave this album 1 star!This album is richly layered ,intricate and ,something missing from these days of post-grunge monotony,:intelligent.Yes The Freshman is a great song ,but it is hardly the be all and end all of ""Villians"".To be honest it's one of the weaker tracks.The Great Ones personal favorites are ""Reverand Girl"",""Myself""&""The Ominous Man"",but there isn't really a bad song on the album.If the Verve Pipe ever releases a greatest hits cd, they""ll be hard pressed not to simply include all of ""Villians"".The Rock gives it his highest recomendation to those who enjoy a taste of art with thier music.If you don""t like this record, just go back to listening to your roody-poo Poison tapes."
1,it is the worst CD that you can buy,It is terrible.The Freshman is good but all of the other songs are unbeleivably terrible. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk it is like throwing money away.
1,Horrible and Detestable!,"The Vervepipe has made the worst CD ever known to mankind. The only song that shines on the CD is the Freshmen. All the other songs are filth. A warning to all who like ""The Freshmen""~the rest of the CD is horrible! Save your money and your ears!"
2,I kept an open mind,"I'm going on record as to saying that most of these songs I heard on this album came from the samples. That's why I'm not going to completely pan this album. I found ""Reverened Girl"" to have some promise, but the rest of the samples were rather disenchanting. I heard the one song ""Cup Of Tea"" in it's entirity, and I found that to be one of the worst songs of the 90's besides ""Bittersweet Symphony"", ""I Am A Pig"", ""Fade Into Veiw"", and ""Brand New Day"". I feel that Weird Al could make that song into a bonafide novelty record by redoing it, and naming it ""Chicken Of The Sea""."
5,A Must Listen,I've been a Greg Brown fan for a few years now. Only recently did I have a chance to see him live(Asheville) and it was truly one of the most memorable musical experiences I've ever had. His songs should be put in a time capsule and saved so the future can remember that this beautiful music existed.
3,"an okay tube, but pops easily","These tubes are very inexpensive, which is nice. However, the price is reflected in the quality: these tubes are very thin and pop easily. I am going to start paying a little more to get thicker tubes."
5,The Perilous Fight,As a history teacher I found this video to be a very good addition to the 20th century collection for my classes. I was not disappointed except for a few events that were not filmed in color.
1,Martin Sheen? PLEASE!!,"Martin Sheen narrating a military documentary? That's like saying Apocalypse Now was an accurate portrayal of the Vietnam War (Vietnam; the sole template liberals use when discussing any military action). My father is a veteran on WW2, and I will not insult him by purchasing a product narrated by make believe president Martin Sheen."
3,Not the best book by Bishop Fulton J. Sheen,"I've read and appreciated many of Bishop Fulton J. Sheen's books, and I consider this one the worst. I believe (but am not sure) that this is an earlier work of his written before he fully developed his down-to-earth style. Gone is that easy-going, conversational style that socks you between the eyes with profound truths and wonderful, soul-saving advice when you least expect it. Please don't misunderstand, this book is pack with profound truths, but it is a lot of work just to read.No doubt anyone who has become a fan of Bishop Sheen will want to read this, but if you are just beginning to read his works, begin with another book."
4,Good but not great....,"Good but not great....Bali Women's Lacy Skamp Hikini, Black, 8...would not buy again....they are very tin ...sheer and are fine for home....not real supportive for my taste!~"
3,New Power Soul lacking,"To say that this recording by T. Artist is unispiring or uneven would be an injustice to the man who is truly a modern day Mozart. However, this latest attempt is far from great and even a die-hard fan (freind) like myself find it hard to keep this CD in the play mode for long. The flashes of brillance are there (as always) as demonstrated on The One, Come On, and was it only me that found She-Bed-Oh an infectious melody?? Anyway, the man needs a hit. Period. Thankfully, next year he has one all ready given the stamp of approval. Hopefully, he can rise above this gimme next year and produce the album we've all been waiting to hear. Otherwise...""2000 party's over oops out of time"""
3,"Well,",I think he was trying to experiment with this release because his songs doesn't seem to flow as effortlessly as his other hit CDs/albums. His strongest songs has got to be UNTIL U'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN and WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY.
4,"I love the cd.Wish it was more rock,more guitar.","Even though this isn't a PRINCE record he reported on his board ,he wasn't releasing an album until ""99 this is essentially his band with PRINCE AS LEAD SINGER(OF COURSE).I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE.I especially like THE ONE, COME ON , WASTED KISSES.Enjoying this cd while waiting on the next GREAT!!!! cd."
3,Old Twentieth Enter the Twilight Zone,"In the future there is a great war caused by the masses who think the expensive immortality treatment is out of their reach (this is revisting ground covered in another of Haldeman's novels). The immortals strike back and kill all the normals with a horrific bio weapon.A group of immortals take a slow trip to another star bringing along a virtual reality machine that lets them totally immerse themselves in the illusion of being on earth during the twentieth century (hence the title ""Old Twentieth.""However things start to go wrong in a big way.The book was great until the last few pages where..put it this way if you've seen the film "" The Thirteenth Floor"" you will wince as you read on and get the feeling that you have just entered .... the Twilight Zone. I almost hoped the ending would not be what it was, that I had somehow guessed wrong, but I did not.After I finished I sat there scratching my chimp-like head hoping Haldeman's next book might end better."
2,"Started slow, ended predictibly","I had a hard time caring about the parts of the book that were spent in the ""time machine."" I mean, what was the point? They were just like when someone tells you about a dream that they had. So what?The book didn't get interesting until about 100 pages into the story.Then the ending was rather predictible. This was readable, but left me feeling like I had wasted my time reading it. That gets it two stars from me. Because some books just aren't even readable."
4,typically entertaining and soundly plotted,"I don't think Haldeman writes anything second rate. It's always a safe bet that his science fiction will offer a strong plot, sound technical background and worthwhile characters, and it will leave you speculating afterwards. Some more than others.Old Twentieth has all these elements. It also derives strongly from Haldeman's experience with, and contemplations on, warfare. The plot weaves together near future events and, while the virtual time machine is neither a new nor easily credible aspect, the story offers strong technical elements and is satisfying. Neither is the twist at the end, alas well telegraphed by many other reviews, unique to this story, but it works for a enjoyable and satisfying novel."
5,A great relationship book,This book is probably the best book I have ever read. I betrayed my wife through an affair. I read this book and am applying the principles to try to get my wife back before it is too late. We are 6 months into our separation and I only wish I had read this book in month 1. I made many of the mistakes that Gary points out I should not have made or make as I am try to save my marriage. This book is completely biblically based and scriptually sound in its teachings. Excellent!!
5,"Great quality, great product!","It's abut pricey bur it's Lodge! Great quality, great product .., and my grandkids will be able to enjoy it!"
5,This is the best choice!,"I read several reviews about different types of grills and decided a seasoned cast iron model would be the best choice. I was right, my husband has used it several times and says it is convenient, heats up evenly, and is hotter than the grill it sits on. Thus, grilling time is shortened and the meats are juicier and delicious. Since it is seasoned from the factory a little oil each time works perfectly."
5,This is the work of a genius,Moodymann comes up with the goods again. He reinvented my faith in dance music ... forevernevermore.
3,Great content but poor quality print.,This book has excellent content but poor print quality. I contacted the publisher-Riverhead/Penquin Putnam and they told me to return it to them. I received a replacement and it is no different. They wanted me to return it to Amazon but I contend that it is not Amazon's problem. It is indeed a print quality issue which should be addressed by Riverhead.
3,Meguiars,Not the best conditioner and cleaner you will find out there. It doesn't get out the grime that was caked into the vinyl that I had on my boat.Get another cleaner if you have moderate/heavy soiled vinyl. It does condition faily well though.
5,Great book.,"This was a gripping book and very inspirational. I've read quite a few NDE type books and what I like about this one is that is presented as, this is my experience and what I've found to be helpful in life. Bill doesn't try to push his views on you but let's his story and life experience speak for itself."
4,A Great Collection,"This is a great compilation. Even if you have some of the songs already, the versions here are crystal clear sounding. Someone obviously took great care in the remastering. It even has the ""original"" version of ""Brown Eyed Girl"", something that you can't even get on Van Morrison CDs."
3,Flashback to the 60's,"Light the incense, bring out your beanbag and turn on the lava lamps. This trio of CDs is a good mix of 60's favourites put together in this great little compilation. The book of photos that comes with it is a bonus too. Good value, great tunes and very cute packaging."
1,run around,"I gave one star only because I have to put something in, I don't have any product to review just the process that was ridiculous. I ordered a pair of earrings, which when they arrived were completly different than what I ordered. I emailed and got no response for three days. So I sent the earrings back with a picture of the earrings that I had ordered. Finally someone got back to me in the mean time and said they would look into it. After a week, I wrote again stating that I hadn't heard anything and wanted to know what was going on. The reply was that if the earrings were in stock they would be sent to me and if not my credit card would be refunded. After a few days, I got an email from the same person stating that my earring would be shipped that day. A little over a week later, I got an email stating that my credit card has been reimbursed. Lovely, but I have no earrings (which were supposed to be a gift) and it is almost a month later."
3,"Somewhat entertaining, but not as good as his first book","This was a somewhat entertaining read, but not as entertaining as ""If Chins could Kill"". I would call this neutral in terms of spending your time, you won't regret it, but you won't miss it if you skip it."
4,A book with some class.,"Well, the title of the review may be a tad misleading. In reality, this is a fun, entertaining look at the inner workings of Hollywood by a B-level superstar. Though I love most of his work, Bruce Campbell discusses how easy it can be to be blacklisted by a very finicky industry and some of the inside politics and tongue biting needed to survive if you are not one of the chosen ones. I certainly hope some - if not most - of the events in this book are exaggerated/fabricated for entertainment purposes. Even if that is the case, this is a VERY entertaining book. Don't seek enlightenment and simply approach it as a great read from a unique perspective."
4,Awesome,"I got this for my brother in law for his birthday, if you are a fan then this book is for you."
3,OK,"I didn't read this myself, my husband did and he was really disappointed with this book. He said it wasn't as good as the other one by him, the if chins could kill."
1,A let down after Bruce's forst book was so great...,"This book is akin to really bad fanfic, with the author inserting himself into fictional events that just don't gel. I slogged through this snore fest for about a third of the way before I just gave up. It was NOT funny. Bruce's life, career, and his experience in the business are fascinating. He lampoons that in this book to poor effect. A serious let down."
4,I recomend this book,"David Drake seems to bring a degree of historical realism to the team that is lacking in SMS solo work and the story and writing are first rate. Unlike the Draka, who are cartoonish, the Chosen are much more believable as a totalitarian warrior caste complete with the inherent weakness of such regimes. The Santander Republic is also believeable and shows the good and bad of a free society going to war.The bad news: There are still the excessivly cute references (PT109 being rammed & ""Gridley"", for instance) that jar from the story by reminding of the authors presence. And a lot of the technological details get glossed over. How BIG are those airships anyway???"
4,Raj Whitehall returns!,"Using a highly believeable plot twist, Raj is back in business (Sort of) Continuing with his very enjoyable practice of using earth history as the basis for his plot, this novel mixes the Spanish Civil War and WWI, along with some poor man's Draka to come up with a real page turner. Highly recomended"
2,Bad book binding,"The book is great, and the thing to get if you want to improve at chess and/or enjoy solving chess puzzles. However, be warned that the pages of the book came out fairly soon after I started working through the puzzles. The book binding and print quality was very poor. I don't know if this is a general problem with the publishing company or not, but it was the case with both 1001 chess puzzle books I got by the great Mr. Reinfeld."
1,"Same Old, Same Old","Why is it that RCA/BMG keeps repackaging the same Dolly Parton songs over and over and over again?Each of the songs on this collection have been anthologized before, while other vital early songs remain out of print.There is some first rate material here. ""The Bargain Store,"" and especially ""Coat of Many Colors"" are superb songs that help establish Parton as one of the most compelling voices in country music. But too much of this compilation is taken up with songs from the far less interesting pop/Hollywood era of her career. These songs are readily available elsewhere while such profound songs like ""Down From Dover,"" ""Gypsy, Joe, and Me,"" ""In The Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)"" ""My Blue Ridge Mountain Boy"" etc. remain unavailable and out of print in either their original album form or in any compilation form.The RCA/BMG treatment of Parton's early back catalog is an outrage, and this latest compilation is just more evidence of that."
1,Sigh,"Yet another Parton compilation that ignores her most vital early songs, while concentrating on the pop/Hollywood sellout era and the same handful of songs.""Jolene,"" which is contained here, is a great song, but the rest of this is mostly the slick pop commercial Dolly that has been over anthologized. Meanwhile many of her best songs like ""Down From Dover,"" ""Gypsy, Joe and Me,"" ""Just The Way I Am,"" ""In The Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad),"" ""My Blue Ridge Mountain Boy,"" etc. remain unavailable and out of print.This compilation is just another example of RCA/BMG's incompetence in dealing with Parton's back catalog."
1,absolute garbage,one broke in less than a minute... scooping chocolate ganache (nothing hard) the other broke in 15 minutes... definitely don't buy...
1,Broke the first time I used it,"This scoop broke the first time I used it. It is a great size, but not durable at all."
1,poor quality,I was disappointed when i received these items (2) both appear to have a defect. the ring was misaligned and did not scoop out the product out and it keeps getting off track. I though perhaps maybe one was defected but it appears they both were. I also purchased the same product from Norco and they are perfect. I don't think I will purchase this brand Fox Run again.
1,Piece of Junk!,"This made in China scooper is pretty much worthless and a total waste of money. I have an Italian made scooper which cost a lot more money but the quality far surpasses this piece of junk. The only reason I purchased this scooper was because I needed this size and Fox Run was the only brand I could find. The metal sliding mechanism inside the scooper that's supposed to scoop out the material slips out of alignment when you squeeze the handle and I used it for soft cookie dough. From reading other reviews of this scooper, it seems to be a common problem and attributed to poor workmanship and quality."
3,good but slow,"Poetic, beautifully written, but much more dependant on atmosphere than character development. Not a whole lot of action or dialogue. Still good though."
2,"A ""Huh?"" Ending","This is one of those books where you get suddenly to the end and gasp ""Huh?!"" I didn't see an end coming at all, and what a let-down when it did. I listened to the audio version of this book and was never very engaged by this novel (perhaps I was distracted?). The subject is interesting and educational, but I didn't get a sense of direction for this book other than a Polish officer who goes around fighting the Nazis while snagging ""quality time"" with women along the way. In the end, this book just didn't do it for me, and I would avoid further Durst novels."
3,"Very hard, but fun","This is a basic spaceship game where you fly around destroying objects.No saving functions, just 3 lives and game over when you die 3 times, and that's frustrating. It took forever but I finally destroyed the first boss using dodging tactics to defeat him.I never got farther than the third level, where ground level tanks are waiting to blast you."
3,Just because I love you,This album is really good. All her song seem that they come from her heart. My favorite song on this album is Just because I love you. I cant relate to that song because I love some one just like the way she sings it. The album is worth really buying because you will never get tired of listening to it.
3,good product but didn't got the color i needed,"good product, excellent texture and it stays.the only thing its that it's very difficoult to math the real color over the internet and i got it darker than i need it, maybe next time i'll get it right"
1,Don't waste your money...run to another manufacturer,"I was looking for a 1 tablespoon scoop. This is the right size. But a poorly made product. The bowl-scraper arm became dislodged on the second scoop of cookie dough. Oxo and Norpro have very reliable, well-made products and I will not stray again."
5,Beware of Charon!,"The ""bad guy"" in this book is enough to give you nightmares!!Not just in the scary sense, but in the twistedness of the foes ways and reasons of his behavior!!Very action packed and moving story! I couldn't put this book down!Can't wait for the end of October to come for Christopher Golden's newest book ""Ghosts of Albion: Accursed"" to be released!!"
1,Not what I thought...,"The only other Gregory book I have read was Respectable Trade, which I enjoyed and thought was well written. I chose Wise Woman because of the subject matter, it sounded intriguing. The writing was awful. I mean, the story is supposed to take place in England in the time of Henry VIII. Did they really use expressions like ""he was hot for the wench?"" It would be laughable if it wasn't so sad. I think Philippa Gregory must be one of the more highly overrated writers in the ""historical"" genre, not really serious. I couldn't finish this book. You know, life is too short. Still looking for a good ""Wise Woman"" book, though."
1,Awful,"I love philippa gregory's books and bought this one to tide me over until the white princess is released. It was okay for the first third, bad for the second third, and terrible for the last. Thoroughly uninteresting characters, a love interest I want to kick in the groin, and her sacrifice at the end makes no sense at all. I don't see how anyone could give it more than two stars. A terrible piece of work that should be avoided by true fans."
2,the wise woman,"As are all of her movels, this one was written very well, but the content just wasn't very interesting."
3,"Fictional Characters, Intrigue, Lust, & Witchcraft in Henry VIII's England","A good read, but not an excellent one. I much preferred Gregory's novels of historical fiction, and I read them all. Her lead character, Alys, is a mixed bag, even given the surprise ending. I can only give a moderate, rather than hot, recommendation of this book."
2,It's ok,"I am collecting, (and of course reading) all of Philippa Gregory's books but sometimes I feel like her books are written by different authors. For me, this particular book was hard to follow and very confusing, even more so than some of her other books. I will keep this book in the library to complete my set but most likely will not read it again."
2,Ho Hum,"Not her best work. I found this book depressing and was not satisfied with the resolution. I still look forward to Gregory's new book this fall, but I wouldn't recommend the Wise Woman."
1,Dreadful writing.,"This book is so unappealing, so boring and so full of lazy, endless repetition on the part of the writer that I can't even be bothered to write out a proper review. Just skip it."
3,OK..but not the best...,"I, as many others, am a HUGE gregory fan..I have read most of everything she has written, Wise Woman being one of the last. I have to admit, this wasnt my favorite book. Some of the scenes, espc the witchcraft and sex, were espc disturbing for me..similar to the incest theme and madness in Wideacre.I did however like the underlying message this book and many of Gregory's books protray..that of the non exsistent value of women from this time in history.I will put this book next to Wideacre on my bookshelf, prob not one Id read again."
2,Not a fan this time,I love Philippa Gregory books and am a huge fan of her royal historical fiction novels. This one seemed much too inconsistent and slow-paced in comparison to the other ones. I detested Alys and found her incredibly unrealistic and outright crazy. I had much more sympathy for the so-called villains of the novel and by the end of the novel was glad to have been rid of Alys' story. It's a shame I feel this way about this book; I hope her other books I haven't read yet will not disappoint as this one has.
3,The Wise Woman,"This book is in the author's Tudor series; however, it steps further into the mystical that I was expecting. It is well written, but if you are looking for another Tudor book like The Other Boleyn Girl you might be disappointed."
5,A classic gay teen love story,"This is truly a classic and beautifully written piece of gay literary art. I wish it (and books like it) had been available to me when I was on the verge of coming out in the late 1960s.CODY is the somewhat revised edition of the author's earlier and once rare book, CLICKING BEAT ON THE BRINK OF NADA. As a title, CODY probably works better ;-)The story is the bittersweet tale of two teen boys who, after starting out as friends, quickly come to love each other very much. Unfortunately, they feel that love for one another - deep as it is - in different ways even though they do eventually share a sweet and romantic sexual intimacy.This is a great book for adult men who (via some great, evocative writing) want to revisit their adolescent years; but further, it's almost a ""must"" for gay, bi and questioning teen boys."
1,Pretty much same experience as C. Hamilton rater,"Purchased four from Amazon. No mention of them being refurbished, but price was suspiciously low ($199 vs. minimum of ~$420 anywhere else). As per C. Hamilton's experience, could not get them to work. Virtually no decent instructions available and no support. I even took it to the computer-geek place, and he put several hours into it, opening and trying two of the units. Could only get a very blurry image. He only charged me for one hour for the failed attempt, and I sent them back to Amazon. I really really hope they don't charge me some stupid fee for reboxing or over 30 days or something."
5,Wears well,"I first read this over forty years ago while in high school. The characters are as alive now as they were then. Now having served in the military, in combat, i appreciate it even more."
5,"Hoo-YA, By far the best book Ive read in recent memory","I received this book as part of my uncles estate and just started reading it to pass the time beetween shifts at work, That lasted about a half chapter.....I was hooked, The charachters are easy to identify with and the story is gripping, I couldnt stop reading it. I had previously not read any books by Mr. Uris and I am now going to read them all. I highly reccomen you do to........"
2,Ripped me off,"I persevered with this book, despite never really liking the characters, until I was within a slender pinch of pages of the end. At that point, little miss spoiled and ridiculous Georgie does something completely unbelievable. And Nick supposedly finds it charming. And suddenly these two nice enough people are shown to be morally groundless and stupid. It doesn't make sense and is out of character. I threw the book in the trash rather than waste another moment with it. Who cares how it ends?!"
5,An Extraordinary Memoir,"This book was very impressive: readable, informative, and funny, it was hard to put down once I started. For anyone with an interest in World War II aviation, it is a must read. It's one of those really memorable accounts, in the same vein as Stephen Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers."" I recommend it very highly.Truman Smith was one of the good ones, one of the best of the greatest generation. He passed on just last year (2011)."
5,Excellent book by a B-17 pilot,"As the son of a B-17 pilot, I have read several books on the subject. This is a very good one (another is ""Serenade to the Big Bird""). I learned more about the author's experiences during his non-flying time, how he felt sure early on that he'd never survive the war, how he grew confident in his flying skills, and married a young German girl after the war (they are still married! I wrote him a letter thanking him for writing the book and she called me to thank me.)It would make a good movie."
5,ALL EAGLES ARE SUPPOSED TO SOAR,"I THINK THE BOOK IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND PROVIDES SOME POSITIVE POINTS FOR TEACHERS. IF ALL TEACHERS WERE TO HAVE THE SAME TEACHING TECHNIQUES AS THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS BOOK OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE. I THINK THAT ALL TEACHERS NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, THE AUTHOR DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN WRITTING THIS BOOK."
4,A shame this couldn't have been filmed in Indiana.,See title. Enjoyable but the ending is trite and twisted in order to end happily.
3,"Good For Entertainment, Not Learning","I used also used this book for my college history class. It was very entertaining, but be forwarned that there is a lot of graphic and suggestive language in the book!"
3,Very Long... Interesting Concept...,"This book could have been excellent. Monsarrat is a good story teller. I think this book should have been expanded into several volumes rather than it's current form. The entire first section is devoted to a third person history lesson on the life and times of Sir Francis Drake. It culminates when the Spanish Armada is set to invade England and is driven off. That is when the real story begins.As an adventure story, this one is a little lacking. As a history lesson, it is good at showing some of the more obscure incidents in time. Wilbur Smith and Gary Jennings are the masters of adventure/history.Anyway, if you decide on this one, plan on it taking a long time to read. Very little action to speak of and only one real character is developed."
4,Great player - second time around,"My only concern with the Panasonic DMP was that the first unit would not work - the disk tray would not open, even after I tried the troubleshooting guides suggestions on button sequences to overcome this problem.Amazon was great in getting the unit replaced immediately and reimbursing my shipping costs, and the replacement unit works wonderful! What a great picture, even for the old DVDs!"
4,great blu-ray player for older receivers!,"This is a great blu-ray player and the only one so far to play dvd-audio (now the Oppo does as well for 500 bones), so if that interests you then you are getting a two-for-one deal. This receiver does (contra previous reviews) decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS High Resolution, but not DTS-HD Master. Dolby TrueHD discs like The Dark Knight sound incredible, and of course if a disc has a lossless PCM file (like the first Hellboy or Cars) then this player will pass the lossless sound either over hdmi or the 7.1 analog outputs (this has been confirmed in several forums - the problem is that Panasonic techs do not know what they are talking about). Thus the 7.1 analog outputs are useful for getting the lossless sound of both bds and dvd-audios to older receivers like mine (the exception begin DTS-HD master like Hellboy 2). The picture is great, but the load time is a little slow. Once it gets going, however, the picture and sound are well worth it!"
4,"Decent sander, packaging needs work","I bought this from my local wood working store. When I got it home I found that the 9"" cast plate was broken. It was not just cracked, it was fractured. It was likely damaged in shipping. Another person mentioned that his sander arrived with a broken disk as well.I bought it locally because I felt that the chances I would receive a broken tool were less --- WRONG! Jet probably should work on their packaging a little bit more.Other than that initial bad experience I am fairly happy with it.The dust collection could be a little better, but it does a fairly decent job.UPDATE: I wrote a note to Jet describing my trouble with the first unit, and they sent me some abrasives for my trouble. Jet's customer service is quite good in my opinion."
5,Good child's book for all levels,"We are newbies to chess and I purchased this book with Their Highnesses Childrens Chess Set (which is wonderful). We are still learning but the book is well written, aka easy to understand and in comfortably broken down steps. Good illustrations too. Recommended!"
4,impressive selection,"This ranks as one of my favorite albums. It has several of Earl Thomas Conley's biggest (and best) hits on it, such as ""Fire and Smoke,"" ""Nobody Falls Like a Fool,"" ""Honor Bound,"" ""What She is (is a Woman in love) and ""What I'd Say."" I was very impressed when I saw it in the store. So impressed, in fact, that I bought it, and I never regretted it. ETC has a remarkable voice, and you might like this album if you give it a chance. This reviewer recommends it."
5,about time!,"I have been what the author calls a ""pilatista"" for 15 years, and I wish someone had written a book like this sooner! I commend her on the vast collection of research and information included in the book, which has been both helpful and inspirational. I will be looking forward to the sequel!"
5,"Her first, and best","Queen of Siam was Lydia's first solo release, and, in my opinion, her best. Her voice sounds like that of a psycotic little girl - her words pouring out of her mouth like liquid.Her unique chanting and drumroll of words can be found in tracks like ""Mechanical Flattery"", ""Tied and Twist"", and ""Blood of Tin"". In other tracks, she sings with what seems malicious intent. In ""Lady Scarface"" [on of my faves] a haunting jazzy song about the seduction of the young and innocent. And out of all the versions of ""Gloomy Sunday"" I've heard, Lydia does the best. And how can you not dance to the beat of ""Spooky"" - a twisted love tale?Queen of Siam shoul be in any goth's collection."
4,OTHER WORDLY,This album is eerie and depressing but musically very good. The song Gloomy Sunday is as morbid as Michael Gira of Swans at his worst. There's very litle real singing -- just the gorgeous Ms Lunch mumbling and talking -- a bit like a recorded seance. But no less interesting and worthwhile for that. For those who love fringe music.
4,Excellent effort,A true story that is written to be as compelling as the ordeal itself. It will make you realize how strong man can be when faced with vitrually no hope and minimal supplies.
4,Compelling,"After finding out that Steven Callahan was a consultant on the film ""Life of Pi"" I decided to read his book. As a beginning coastal sailor it was interesting to see the challenges encountered with an ocean passage. However, more important than this, this book showed the strength and determination of the human spirit for survival when encountering unbelievable odds. Added to this is Steven's spiritual bond with the very nature that threatened to take his life. Well written and a must read for the adventurous soul."
4,A good book,This was a very good book that was well written and had me believing that I was adrift also.It makes you appreciate each day as a gift.
4,Excellent read,A complete story leaving no lose ends and surprisingly keeps your interest by exploring the numerous aspects of what might seemingly be a static journey.
4,Anthony Logistics,"I purchased this kit for my boyfriend. He always gets ingrown hairs on his face caused after shaving. He has a really thick beard and This kit has really reduced he amont of ingrown hairs after he shaves. He really likes the facial wash and shaving cream. This kt makes a great gift and works!! It also makes his face soft, smooth, and smell like peppermint!"
2,Not that great.,The piece looks nice. There are 2 problems with this product.The bottom leaves a terrible rust stain if it gets wet. It is going to get wet since we use it near a sink.For some reason the soap bubbles out of the top of the pump where it screws on. I thought I was overfilling it but it doesn't matter how much soap I put in there. It will leave soap residue all down the side.All in all this is a poor functioning product.
5,Beyond Expectations! Amazing!,Our family is Jewish - Conservative and we absolutely love this book. We first saw it at our synagogue gift shop as we wanted some readings for putting up our Mezuzot. The book is so beautifully written that we keep it on our living room coffee table. It is short enough for guests to get a good look at it and we always receive warm compliments from all backgrounds. It's a lovely way to stay a little connected and share some of the lesser known beauties of Judaism.
5,The Gods must be crazy - First edition,"Dear Lord, this is by far the funniest, fun, and educated movie that has come out of Africa. I can never get enough of it. Thus far, I have watched this movie three times and I am dying to see The Gods must be crazy 11. My only question is, when will Amazon get both films in DVD version? I cannot wait to by both of them once the DVD version is released. Please get out there and rent the Gods must be crazy film. It is truly entertaining for the entire family. I am totally crazy about this movie."
5,Just like I remembered it,"A great movie. A lot of slapstick, a lot of silliness, and a lot of charm.The characters are great, believable and well acted, even if the movie doesn't spend tons of time developing them. The humor is clean and lighthearted.I love this movie, and it will continue to be a tradition in my family."
4,Funny DVD,"Funny DVD, I had the VHS version and needed to upgrade to the DVD version. The quality was good and it met my expectations."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever Made,This movie starts off with very slow dry humor as it progresses there are scenes that are so funny you will cry from laughing so hard. It's just one of the funniest best movies ever made. There are parts of it that you will swear they were using a crank camera but it's ok it just adds to the fun. Well worth watching and a gem to own.
2,Extremely technical sound. Not for everyone.,"This band isn't really one I can sink my teeth into. In fact, sometimes everything about Starkweather can get pretty bleak and mediocre. But I feel alot better knowing I gave an underground band a chance. Now I'll admit there's nothing about Starkweather that would make them completely suck. But this band and album is only for the extreme fan of technical, underground and loud-but-not-in-a-good-way type of music. I feel much more comfortable and touched listening to Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Anthrax, Stabbing Westward and Godhead. I would advise anyone buying this album to not grow too attached to Starkweather if they're thinking about it. This band rarely gets along when they're in the studio together and they even admitted publically that they may not be together after their next album. Just a fair warning. However, anyone who can't help but grow close to Starkweather may want to also check out IDK, Coalesce, Wayward Pain, and Gouds Thumb."
5,quick!,"In one weekend I put together a gorgeous little rabbit, and have half finished the monkey (can't wait to see him finished). These patterns are really simple, and a lot of fun. Can't wait to try more!"
2,Which Huxley?,"I watched this to find out more about Aldous Huxley, but the main focus seems to be on the greatness of Laura Huxley as seen by herself. She comes across as self-involved and tiresome. I didn't need to know about her best-selling contributions to pop psychology, and she tells us little or nothing about her husband."
1,not very good,has the same cover as the old outlaw album from long ago.but hasn't the same music or songs. I think I was ripped.
5,Fun,"This game is fun and challenging. You are able to tweak the UI and make it harder to beat the players if you are playing against the computer. Tons of courses and golfers. The trees could be a little taller, because you can drive over almost all of them along the fairways."
5,Delightful Book with Good Pictures,"This book covers the various aspects Michelangelo's works, with easy to read information text and pictures of many of his achievements. I'm happy I bought this book. I also bought Rizzoli's book on Michelangelo. The two books together showed and told me just what I was searching for. I knew little of his life and achievements and now have a pretty good grasp of what he really did."
3,"21st Century Health Care, B Complex Natural. with C, 100 Caplets","I think they are good vitamins, they are not strong and do notupset your stomach, have no side effects. They are excellent!!"
1,Unity Lunacy,"Charles Fillmore was an insurance salesman who founded a cult called Unity. Why oh why would anybody with a functioning brain bother reading the ""works"" of this snake oil salesman?"
3,No Lobos,A very general book about the relatives of the wolf. Besides a picture of the wolf there is nothing written about it. A good general book for 1st through 3rd grade. The lack of information on the wolf holds this book back from being very good.
5,x man begins his legacy with this album,I just got this album and i cant stop listening to ithere are the must listen too's#2 At the speed of life#3 just maintain#4 eyes may shine#7 paparazzi (my personnal favorite on the cd and my new favortie song of all time)#8 the foundation#10 Birds eye view#12 carry the weight#14enemies and friendsI hope this helps and now i got 4 out of 5 of x's albums but my review for 40dayz 40nightz is comin soonRob(x to tha z follower)
1,fine french cinema - For Me To Poop On!,"Fantastic Planet is to Time Masters as The Oscar is to The DayTimeEmmy. As Fine Art is to Blind Commerce. As a beautiful bowel moveent is to severe constipation. It's 100% trash with the most ridiculous tacked-on ending I've seen in my movie going history. A total wash and a complete disappointment. Crap on a stick. Light Years and Fantastic Planet are beautiful, timeless. Time Masters is close to unwatchable...and not in a good way. Most asinine movie I've seen next to....wow, I can think of no comparison....Fortunately I was able to trade my copy in at a local used goods store for a different DVD. I pray that the poor sucker who buys this one doesn't shoot his or herself in the head trying to watch it....""Mike! Mike! Kill me now."" If you watch this you'll get that...please don't"
3,Takes some work,"There is no doubting Mr. McMahon's ability to write, research, and disect the crux of human happiness. What makes this a difficult read is getting through his ego that he injects throughout the book, and just focusing on the content of his research. In my opinion, Mr. McMahon should have taken more of his editor's advice and streamlined his verbosity. If you can get through all of that, it is worth the time. The book can be both therapeutic and educating."
2,Happiness book,Incomprehensible. One must be a phylosopher or well versed in phylosophy to understand the book. I am not.
3,... self-help for the unispired.,"This book has no true spiritual insight to offer but rather focuses upon the entertainment value of hermeneutics and personal presentation. I'm certain that the author is a Rick Warren wanna-be. Although this book likely has an appeal among evangelic faiths, I was disappointed with it and returned it.For those seeking a really useful minister's manual, I recommend either ""Christian Minister;s Handbook"" by Roderick E. Huron or ""Nelson's Minister's Manual"" by Thomas Nelson."
4,good book,"this book was ok. not one of the best books in the world but it was well written. any way, i do recommend it"
1,An excellent book for those who do not wish to learn finance,"I used to be ""illiterate"" in terms of finance and I thought that this book would help me to comprehend the basic principles of corporate finance. Unfortunately, the content of this book is completely implicit. The authors wrote a book without taking into account the nature of the audience. Consequently,this book does not address to financial managers or to any kind of managers or even students. The only people who can really understand the content of this book is the authors themselves!After having read many books regarding corporate finance and financial management, I have become familiar with this discipline. There are hundreds of well-structured remarkable books that you can purchase at a lower price..."
3,beauty + filler,"the album for me is worth buying for the song Ride Me, which is weird and scary and beautiful - taking a certain kind of sound and doing it as well as it can be done. if they had kept in this vein, it might have been a more interesting album - it seems like a ""let's stretch our legs"" album after working with Mark Clifford in Seefeel...trying things out a bit, but it just doesn't come together. On all their albums they have a tendency to stick in these instrumental filler tracks, which to me sound like noodling and tend to dilute the impact of the songs, which hold together better. Scala has made some great moments of music in general, in fact, especially on the singles and EP's; too bad they're not all on the same album, and so watered-down with lesser tracks."
4,Great Book!,"I thought this book was very realistic, because it is the real racing world to be competitive,which this book won't have much of! I wish they would come out with more thouroughbred books.I liked it alot."
3,loved it!,"I thought the book was great!I love reading the Thoroughbred series.I wish the books were longer though.I think Christina and Star make a great book.And i hope there will be loads more!I'm glad the books are back into racing,i like eventing but i think racing's way more intresting."
2,MIld,"Mildly titilating, Mildly interesting, Mildly informative, Playboy can and usually do better than this, and so can you.....look elsewhere."
1,The Gospel According to LaHaye,"To have Tim LaHaye tell it, this man has a direct hotline to God. This book is probably the biggest waste of time in literary history. This book and his Left Behind series are just forms of mind control...I mean, come on, what Biblical justification does he have for portraying Jesus as a murderer? Overall this book reflects on Christianity's transformation from a religion of love and understanding to a religion of fear and fire insurance. What [...]. Read the Bible and come up with your own opinions, don't have some false prophet tell you what to think."
4,Good Book For The Profecy-minded christian.,"If you haven't, as I have not, gotten any of the ""Left Behind"" Series, I think you will find in this book a summary of all these series. The authors made a statement that made a big impact in my life; ""...thousands of our churches today never enjoy a prophetic message or sermon - not because the pastor doesn't believe in it, but because he doesn't know much about it."" (Page 4, 5). It is very important to study prophetic events because, in my opinion, it motivates you to a life of holiness for God. This book will help you on your path to understand prophecy and the endtimes. I think you'll like it!"
3,This was good...but...,"I liked the book with all it's scriptural interpretations, but...when I think about it, these are Fundementalists interpreting Scripture! Aren't these the same people who say the Bible must be taken literally? So are they really saying that all Scriptural interpretation is wrong except their's? Also, I think the digs at the Catholic Church were wholly unnecessary. It seems to me a bit infantile to try to dig at the Church that all Protestants can trace their roots to. Pope John Paul II is a great man regardless of what denomination you are. I am an avid fan of the Left Behind Series, but Mr. LaHaye really let me down with this one."
1,Junk,"These guys are ignoramuses. Talk about false prophets! You don't have to be a sanctimonious bull artist to be Christian. These jokers have a powerful political agenda that has nothing to do with the Sermon on the Mount or the Golden Rule. And I vote Republican. Come on, people, think for yourselves!"
1,I've heard this all before.,The authors just seem to re-state what's already been said. Everybody's just 'repeating' the same old information.
3,Reliable & straightforward,"While I differ with LaHaye's pre-trib futurist view of Bible prophecy, you can trust him to give a basic overview of that view w/o goofy Bible Codes, evil European computers, or 666 product labels."
1,Don't waste your money...,"My kitten was definitely interested in the feather feature of this toy, but less than three minutes after I set it up, the blue rod snapped off at the base. A very flimsy little plastic peg, about 3/8 inch long and smaller than the diameter of a wooden match, is all that is supposed to support the rod in the base. The toy is an example of a good idea spoiled by shabby manufacturing. C'mon, Hartz...did you test this toy at all?"
2,ehhh,our cats don't like it. it's too noisy they like the feather and the stick though. won't buy again nope
4,very nice,Got these for my wife and her friend to take to work with coffee in the morning. She says they are very nice and keep her coffee warm for a long time. They stand out among the usual Mugs.
1,Book is crap,"I cant understand why people rate this book positively. This book was hell to read, it needs more examples, both simple and complicated. This book is crap. I salute those who get the material, good luck to the rest!!"
3,Alright for some sections,"Although the book was a very boring read, the depth of knowledge was quite good. There was much more information in the book than was required for my senior course on Process Dynamics and Control in my engineering program."
5,my book,"This is an excellent story by an excellent writer. I have read all of her books that I know of, and some of them twice. The book is wonderful."
4,Land of Dreams,"Wonderful reading. This author really knows how to keep the reader fully in tune with the characters. Great plot. LovedBoth primary characters. You do believe in a jumbled family dynamic, and happily ever after. Good read!/Stephanie"
5,boom boom what a story,An amazing castI love Sylvester Stallone in movieshe can play such great roleshe's really heart warming in this one that I have on dvdMadeline Stowe is amazing tooall in all:the movie is funny at times and can make you laughvery touchingvery powerfuland just downright sincere with what it gets atgive this movie a chance if you haven't already
1,If you have been in business more than three days this book is not for you,"This is perhaps the worst business book I have ever purchased. If you are twelve and doing due diligence on giving up your lemonade stand for a newspaper route, this book is ideal."
2,Girlfriends 1 is better,"Playboy is never going to give you girls getting it on with each other...That's not what they are about. But this video doesn't even do what most of the others do, show beautiful girls! There are a few, but not many. Take a pass..."
3,Good & Stale,I've bought these chips before at Costco and I really liked them. Saw them on Amazon and thought I'd give them a try. Too long on the shelf! These chips were stale! Too bad because they are good when fresh.
2,I normally like these...,"Normally I love these, but the last batch I got tasted like they had been burned. Yuck! I don't know if it was just that batch or what, but I don't think I will be buying these again."
5,"Celiac sufferers, here's a treat!","A member of our family has a severe version of Celiac disease where she not only can't have anything with wheat in it, but she can't have anything with corn, rice or potatoes. Imagine a world without having food that ""crunches""! Since sweet potatoes are really yams, she can eat these without fear...thank you, Terra!"
5,Great Chip,I purchased these sweet potato chips at Costco. When they stopped carrying them I was going through withdrawal until finding them on-line. Great product!!
2,about to expire,"They taste ok but so close to being expired, i'll never eat all 24 bags by then. Not sending back such a big bulky item."
1,burnt,"I was so hoping that the other reviews were wrong and these wouldn't taste burnt. But, allas they are a dark dark brown color and 95% of the 2 bags i opened were brunt and nasty. Amazon was GREAT though. They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf."
1,Can only give these 1 STAR,"I gave it 1 star because there's to many 5 stars.The socks are real thick on the bottom half like these lovers say, but they didn't say that the top half, ankles, are made like CHEAP DISCOUNT STORE GRADE SOCKs. They FIT TIGHT & CUT YOUR CIRCULATION. They are fold over and stitched at the top cutting off circulation to your feet. I don't care if they are so thick you don't need to wear shoes. If you have a deep groove around your ankles you are cutting of blood flow to your feet.I am keeping the one pair I bought to see if I have some use for them but I won't buy more. The bottoms are so thick you couldn't wear with the shoes you have. You would need a size larger shoe."
3,thickness,"I have purchased Wigwam socks before , not on line , from a retail store. I thought the purchased items were comfortable enough but a little too thick (heavy) for summer use. I do like the Wigwam sock overall."
3,Once Upon A Dream,"Gena Campbell's life has not been easy. When she dreams of events three times, they invariably come to pass. In 15th century Scotland, this makes her a witch... or mad. She has been called Gena the Mad all her life. She has a dream of the man she believes will kill her--Anthony MacKay. Then she meets him and attempts to make him kill her. When this fails, her family forces Anthony to marry her. He will not marry her until he is home, and so brings her to his home in the Highlands. On the way she has another dream--a pack of dogs will bring about her demise. Therefore, she realizes, she had misinterpreted her dream of Anthony. When they arrive at Anthony's home, she meets her rival--a madwoman named Celeste. Gena and Anthony marry, but the air of menace remains, and Gena knows that her life is in danger. Though the villain is less than believable and the story overlong, this should satisfy lovers of Scottish tales."
2,Not good in extreme conditions,"I had this player for one year without problems until it just stopped dead one day in the middle of a run. IRiver replaced in twice and the next two players didn't even last one week each! I was informed that due to my extreme weather situation (I live in Texas and summers are extremely hot and humid here) that this might be causing the problems. Maybe they should put this as a disclaimer on their product--""Not good for use in a southern summer!"""
3,Good flash player with bad accessories,"The player is relatively easy to use after a quick run through the instructions. Nice setup to the layered menus and I found the control stick easy to use despite its small size. Sound is good and it was priced similarly to other flash players. The headphones are poor but that seems to be typical for factory offerings included with MP3 players. Big negative for me was the sport armband. Might not be an issue for some but if you intend to move around at all it is a necessity. Armband is poorly designed, too small for an average arm, and looks completely ridiculous (even for an armband, think Judas Priest). Iriver does sell a very nice separate ""sport case with armband"" but include that $20 cost in your comparisons to other players. If it came with the better armband I think the 790 would be a great buy, but since I have to buy that separately I might as well buy an ipod or save $40 and buy a Creative N200."
3,After a year the player died...,"For months the player worked well. It had excellent quality, good reception on radio, and the new UMS feature made it quick and easy to transfer files from and onto a computer. Overall, the player lived up to expectations....until it died. The screen went blank and nothing I did could fix it.If you do get this player get Amazon's 10$ warranty, or get a non-flash player (Iriver H10). Don't let this happen to you."
2,"Plenty of bells & whisles, but poor image scanning","I've always been a big fan of Canon's scanners, but the Canoscan 3000f really let me down. I've been using the Canoscan n1240u and have always liked the great colors and vivid scans. I decided to upgrade to the new 3000f, manily because it will scan negatives and slides. Unfortunately, the reproduction quality on these types of scans are not very good. The color reproduction is very poor and the image quality, even at extremely high resolutions is not as true as it is on some of the less expensive Canon scanners. Even after having spent a lot of time working with various settings and options in the scanning software, the quality was still not as good as I would like to have seen. Hopefully Canon will get these problems fixed with their next line of film & photographic scanners."
4,"old drawings ,new style; very authentic","the book is actually a gathering of drawings taken from old manuscripts accompanied with explaining text.As medieval knights practiced and used swordfighting everyday, they did not see any point in writing their expertise down. Same goes for modern manuals on walking to a busstop, it simply does not exist because it's so common to walk to a busstop. the same goes for medieval sworsmanship it was so common, that hardly anyone took the time and effort to write a manual, except for Talhoffer and some others.Fortunately we now have the opportunity to actually experience what swordsmanship in the middel ages would be like, all you need is a woorden sword, effort and this book."
4,Quality tool at great price,Tool worked as advertised. Instructions are weak.Once you figure out how to remove jams it was quite easy. Great price.
5,Music to my ears...,"My husband loves these bones! Though it's not exactly pleasant being woken up by the sound of bones, they're a great musical instrument. A must-have for any folk or bluegrass lover."
3,Odd Configuration of Ebony Rhythm Bones Bought From Amazon,"I don't care for the way in which these bones are fashioned. I have never owned or seen bones which taper in thickness from one end to the other. The balance has an odd feel and a person playing these bones must be certain to match the ends so as to be sure the thicker, and therefore the heavier ends are farthest from the hand. Any other arrangement produces a weak and anemic sound. I would not purchase bones made this way again, nor would I recommend them."
4,Great way to approach sales,"Rocking the Ages is a beautifully writen book. It takes historical events and explaines how they formed the personality of each generation. This book helped me to curve our marketing and advertising techniques to reach our customers with a positive response. It clarifies how the generations view their lives and what they buy, how and why. It has helped me to understand my customers in a more personal manner. It is easy to get trapped into the needs of one own gereration, but this book clarifies the needs and desires of all generations, and how to approach them on a marketing level."
3,"Work Fine, But Burn Out Fast","I think title just about covers it. They work okay, but don't last very long. I would buy them again though just for the convenience of having a bulb when I need it without much cash outlay."
1,Not that great,"I got this book from a friend who's always giving me fun, short reads. It's an ok book. I saw some other posts saying that this is for people who have no clue and it's true. I believe you can learn at least a little something from every book out there, so I will finish it, but I haven't found anything extraordinary so far."
5,Exciting learning ideas,"This book contained so many excellent paint, playdough and clay ideas that you can make yourself. My preschool class loved them! It was fun to introduce new textures and sensory experiments to them! It was both a learning and playful experience!"
5,pioneering future sound. as good as his balance release.,as good as balance if not better. holden is God. one of the very few dj's that keep me interested in the tired genre of progressive dance music/edm. if your looking for something different then definately shell the 26 for this import. no regrets.
1,THE CLEAR WORD BIBLE BY DR. JACK BLANCO,"I rate the book very highly (five stars) because I have used it for several years. THIS PARTICULAR BOOK, A DUPLACTE FOR MY WIFE, HAS YET TO BE RECEIVED FROM YOUR BOOK SELLING OUTLET."
2,SHOCKED,DS700 PRINTED GOOD PICTURES TILL THE INK TANK RAN OUT AFTER 25 PICTURES. CANON ESTORE WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO FIND THESE VERY EXPENSIVE LITTLE TANKS (22.95 PLUS 7.99 SHIPPING) WISHED I BOUGHT THE HP PRINTER INSTEAD.
4,Excellent beginners guide.,"This book gives a great overview on the basics of making cordials and liqueurs at home. The step by step intructions to set up and explanation of terms used in other texts and this one make it easy to start from nothing. I have only been working with liqueurs about 3 years and have won both contests I have entered using batches from recipes in this book. For SCA, members this is not a great research book, but it tells you how to make fantastic tasting stuff!"
4,A brilliant work.,"Subtle and engaging. This is one of those books that tells more in between the lines than in the overt telling. A treasure of Tibet, of tradition, and of the unraveling of both."
4,Challenging music; defies conventional forms.,"Josette's Eye is a mixture of Patti Smith-style poetry with an edge, folk-rock guitars, a restrained backbeat and Eno-esque atmospherics.Very ambitious songwriters, guitarist Paul Mauer and singer/lyricist B.J. Thompson craft intimate, evocative tales of love, lust, despair and anger, all buoyed by Thompson's gift for imagery and crafting phrases.This is not an album you should expect to dance or play air guitar to. It demands attention and empathy. Those who dig in, though, will find tiny little gems hidden in the mazes that are this album's songwriting structure."
3,fair not good,"I received this book during the Christmas season. The book came damaged from the Post Office. That wasn't the fault of the shipper but the book was dirty and in fair condition not ""good"" as advertised. Everything else was fine.Tery Post"
2,You only receive one tray.,"I agree with the previous post - I did not get the indication that I was getting only one tray, and I would not have gotten this particular tray either had I realized that I was only getting a single tray. The description or picture for this product should be modified, in my opinion. The product itself seems sturdy - however if you use the feet things for the purpose of being footpads; they do not snap in place on the bottom side; which could be a pain if you have to move the tray - especially with full hands. I could see me trying to set the tray down with one of the foot tabs dangling - and making me set it down crooked and my papers going EVERYWHERE... but, that is just me."
3,Interesting subject,"The subject of the book is fascinating, and the author is clearly very knowledgeable. My one complaint is that the writing style is at times impenetrable, seemingly on purpose, as if the author is hinting at things he does not want to say in plain English. But the book is well worth the effort."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I have a number of Scritti Politti albums, including the incomparable Cupid and Psyche '85. This isn't a close comparison. Much too slow, lugubrious, contemplative. Puts me to sleep. Suffers from an overly simple production and uninteresting unlayered backgrounds on what sounds like one tired synth. This isn't horrible, but given the genius of the other albums, this one suffers. I wish I hadn't purchased this album."
1,Not quite Federico Garcia Lorca!!,"An amazing thing happened when I played this CD for the first time. The tracks did not correspond to the 13 poems labeled on the case and on the disc itself. The record company had instead used the wrong master and reproduced 14 tracks of ""bolero"" music sang by Lucho Gatica!!! Be sure to check if wishing to purchase this recording."
1,Disc that was'nt compatible with my order,"I bought the CD ""Poesias De Garcia Lorca. Colleccion De Oro"" thinking that the CD was a collection of Garcia Lorca poems. The Cd arrived earlier than promised which is very nice. BUT instead the CD I ordered I received a CD with cover matching to my order but the content was not Lorca's poems but a CD of the singer Luchio Gatica, no connection to Lorca's poems. I was very disappointed.But I have to say that Amazon was fair and when I wrote them about this problem they made a refund of my payments."
3,An expensive but highly useful tool,"Labat's Manual is very useful to anyone trying to decode syllabic cuneiform signs. The book gives every version of each sign, from primitive pictograph to late period cursive. Unfortunately, it is only published rarely and this makes it very expensive. The paperback version falls apart fairly quickly, but the hardbound, although more expensive, holds up pretty well to heavy use."
2,Gaia has been ruined,"I love the Fearless series but this book doesn't even seem like part of the series. Gaia is not supposed to feel fear. It makes her different from the characters of every other YA book. Gaia as an insecure, scared teenager makes this book the absolute worst of the Fearless series. It reminds me of when Gaia was delusional in the SuperEdition: Gaia Abducted. She is that different. And her with the ""unbearable"" FOH's is unbearing.If you love the Fearless series, don't even bother reading this edition. You'll be extremely disappointed."
5,AWESOME,"DEFINATE MUST READ. GAIA SHOULD HAVE STAYED FEARLESS. SHE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO OLIVER WHEN HE TOLD HER NOT TO DO THE OPERATION. I WISH MS. PASCAL WOULD GIVE GAIA ANOTHER FRIEND LIKE MARY. MY FAVORITE BOOKS IN THE WHOLE SERIES ARE THE ONES WITH HER, ED AND GAIA PLAYING TRUTH OR DARE. WHEN MS. PASCAL WAS WRITING ABOUT GAIA AND MARY, THE BOOKS WERE MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING. AND I DONT REALLY LIKE JAKE, I THINK GAIA AND ED NEED TO GET BACK TOGETHER AND STAY TOGETHER...BUT I STILL LOVE FEARLESS SO YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,NO SUBTITLES,Great little film BUT there are no subtitles for the Japanese parts of the film. HMMMMMMMM
3,Tuna goes Hard Rock.,"America's Choice, Hopkorv and Yellow Fever were Tuna's hard rock triumvirate. Only America's Choice is essential but Hopkorv is not without it's merits either. There are some classic Tuna cuts here with Watch The Northwind Rise as the best of the bunch. Jorma, Jack and Steeler play inspired, hard and tight blues rock. Terrific trio. Worth getting just not a classic...Simon"
3,Highly under-rated entertainer supremo,"As a kid in Miami, my night club loving Grandmother would haul me around to the best floor shows....my favorite then and now ( 40 years later ) is Desi. He may not be the best vocalist, but the band, the arrangements and the sheer entertainment value is very, very solid. Fans of the TV show will certainly be pleased, but those who are looking to fill a niche in their collection of Latin or nightclub/lounge won't be disapointed."
1,"Pop-OFF, not pop-on, worst toy ever had","We got this toy as a present. The train cars keep popping off when they are being moved around. The train only stays connected when not being played. I cannot believe a brand like Fisher Price would ever put this product on the market.We didn't get a gift receipt, so we are stuck with this useless toy.We have another train of the Little People toy series which is 200% better."
1,Missing 3 chapters,"I received my book brand new, and when it came time to study for my midterm, I noticed that 3 chapters were completely missing from this book! Needless to say I am not very happy and will be returning it."
5,In Children's Hands,This is a wonderful book with very thorough references and beautiful illustrations. It has all the information you need for definitions and a bountiful selection of excerpts from different children's books. Highly recommended.
3,Half Essential,"The Essential Series by RCA, which this cd is a part of, rarely lives up to its title(The newer RCA Legends series, despite having fewer tracks, tends to do a better job). Like most Essential cd's, the first half of this cd is filled with great songs by a truly great artist. Many of the songs on the second half, however, have no business whatsoever being on a Waylon Jennings compilation, especially when there are countless Outlaw classics that could take their place."
5,Waylon,Outlaw Country At Its Best A Man That Change The Game Of CountryMusic Forever A Legend Indeed A Must Own For Jennings Fans.
5,Best damn racing book I have read.,"I say best, but it does get confusing, his writing is like he is speaking to you while he is working on an engine in the shop. But the stories are fascinating. The history he tells of Indy and NASCAR are truly fascinating. Subjects that you will never read about in more traditional biographical books, and some of it I am betting that others never wanted made public! I highly recommend this title to anyone who wants to know the history of Motorsport in the USA ."
3,SO SO,NOT MUCH GAIN CONTROLL OR BOOST GAIN IF I HADENT ALLREADY INSTALLED IT I WOULD SEND IT BACK NO GOOD 4 THE MONEY
4,Just as described,Never owned a grill press before but I love this one. I have used it numerous times and have been very happy with the results. Even used it (teamed with a Calphalon 12-inch Grill Pan) for paninni sandwiches and it was also good at that task.
3,Grill Press,"I like this product, but it is a little too small. I wish I had bought one that would press two hamburgers at a time."
4,JUST SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT,"I'M SURE THIS WORKS GREAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING ALL THE LODGE CAST IRON PANS SO FAR AND LOVE THEM ALL. LOVE THAT THEY'RE USA MADE, GOOD QUALITY AND VERY GOOD PRICE. THIS IS STILL GREAT FOR THE PRICE, BUT IT IS SMALLER THAN I PICTURED. I JUST WISH I'D MEASURED THE DEMENSIONS OUT SO I COULD GET A BETTER IDEA. ALSO, I DON'T KNOW KNOW WHY, BUT I WAS PICTURING AND HOPING FOR THE BOTTOM TO HAVE GRILL MARKS. IT'S JUST FLAT, BUT THAT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. WOULD STILL TELL SOMEONE TO BUY THIS, BUT LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE SIZE."
4,Cast Iron Grill Press,"Liking the ""Grill Press"", just wish it was one pound heavier. I have to hold my hand on it continuously., and press on it. Assembly was easy.There isn't a variety of grill presses out there on the market, so selection is slim.I will give this a B+.Like I said, just wish it was heavier."
1,Fanciful propaganda,"The continental forces won Ticonderoga, Saratoga, Trenton, Concord, King's Mountain, the cowpens, and with the help of the French, Yorktown. The british army sat in New York with the continental army (French-free) sitting across from them. The brits chose to sail off to Yorktown rather than come out of hiding n New York and assail the continental army.This book is nothing but a pro-british propaganda book and the author never substantiates anything he claims."
4,Pikake by Terranova,"This is my scent. I love it. I own the oil (or essence), the perfume and the lotion. The essence has the strongest and most long lasting scent, but I like the perfume because the scent is lighter and good for everyday wear. When I got out at night or to a party, I use the oil. It's more dramatic.This a beautiful scent, and I get complimented on it all the time. I highly recommend it and I hope they never stop making it."
2,Disappointing,"This would be a 4-star review if I was looking for a Gospel presentation. Known more for his comedy than his preaching, I was expecting this title to provide comedy knee-deep in riotous, side-slapping brilliance. I had to settle for a few chuckles."
2,Not worth the $,"This book was a huge disappointment. If you want to learn more about astronomy, try some place else. Bad investment"
1,Buyer beware.,"My daughter (7) really wanted this sewing machine. We got it home, unpacked it, finished the stitch on the little blue cloth that comes already sewn and then proceeded to make one of the projects. Well, that's where the fun STOPPED. The stitch wouldn't hold (it wouldn't even stitch). The needle would go through, but it didn't make a stitch. We re-threaded the needle (which is nearly impossible using the provided tool and given the fact that the needle doesn't come up high enough to have a straight shot through), and tried to re-thread the bobbin, but the bobbin thread would not go where it was supposed to (the directions seem vaguely clear, if not contradictory, but following them does not produce the results they promise). I spent about 90 minutes looking for additional help online, and trying over and over to re-thread the needle and bobbin, all to no avail. It broke my daughter's heart to tell her it was going back. This is a poorly built waste of $$."
4,Good upgrade for your old Varsity,"This is a nice seat post for your old Schwinn Varsity. First it's longer than the original post was, it weighs less, and it fits a standard seat clamp readily available at your LBS instead of turning into that tiny diameter up top, forcing you to use that old gnarly clamp up there. Great post for the price."
4,"Hey, It's not bad.....","Since I'm a big fan of Hall and Oates, and the song ""I Can't Go For That"", I had to give this a listen-to. It is pretty good, it's got great vocals, and it sounds like a #1 on the dance charts already. And, sorry BSB fans, it's better than ""I Want it That Way""......"
3,Flat as a pancake,"Got the bed and the material is good but thin and not really for a dog, but my Rottweiler didn't chew it up, which is amazing. I wentt flat in about a month. You can always restuff it I guess, but I didn't want to have to do that. Still not a bad buy for the price."
4,Excellent value for Price,"I took a chance on these beds, buying two , one for my adult dog and one for my new puppy. THEY LOVE THESE BEDS. They were not cheap, not ugly and did not rip the first day. They get a lot of action from my puppy.. he drags them EVERYWHERE and assaults them at every turn and they still look like new.Mine came as no choice on the pattern but they turned out to be a lovely brown/tan stripe, very netural and fitting in with my decor nicely.At the same time I also bought an expensive, extra large microsuede dog bed, which has been destroyed by both dogs. The two cheaper beds will last far longer. A lesson learned. I recommend this bed."
2,This is a tiny bed for a dog under 30 pounds,I have a 60 pound dog and he uses it as a pillow as it is much too small for a bed. The quality is poor and I was able to buy a much higher quality at a lower price at Costco.
3,UGGGGLY,"This was smaller than it appears with the big dog in the photo. It suggests that you will receive a plaid pattern but what I received was not plaid but the ugliest pattern of mock hobo quilt!! With a dirty orange color on the bottom half. You couldnt imagine an uglier pillow... the dog even cringed at it!! She has been speaking to me since I got her this pillow. Its not a compliment to your home, it's an INSULT!!!However the company did ship it quickly... but you would too if you had this pillow!"
4,Nice but doesn't work for bigger dogs!,"I bought this mainly for price but also because the other reviewers had said their big dogs fit on this bed, no problem. That is not the case whatsoever! This bed is for a small dog-med dog and luckily my dog is small enough to fit comfortably.ALSO! Don't get your hopes up for a plaid dog bed. I got a green camo one. I don't mind but just wanted to give a heads up."
1,Step away from the children and no one will get hurt,Revolting third enstallment has two Amish brothers moving into the suburbs and one of them turning the local youth against their parents. Same old garbage that Dimension fans will eat alive. Horrible everything with the exception of the impressive special effects that are one of the main downfalls of this movie.
2,ehhhh,"this one is directed by James Hickox, the brother of Anthony Hickox(WaxWork 1 and 2). its aight but then it doesnt add up to it all, basically a washout of a movie with so much hilarious horror bits that you just cant stand after awhile. though look very close for Nicholas Brendon(Xander on Buffy The Vampire Slayer) hes one of the basketball players."
3,"A Trilogy, that was never complete to begin with",Children Of The Corn Three wasn't so bad. Until the ending. Dimeension & Miramax films could put fourth a litle bit more effort into it.
1,SPARE ME THIS CRAPPY GARBEAGE!,"I repeat, the original had no room for a sequel. What a waste of film and talent. This stuff is worthless. Enough said."
5,Finally Got It!,I have always wanted to get a copy of this particular work of MT's under one volume. This appears to be it!
5,"Wonderful, with beautiful illustrations","Fantastic. Very unusual. The drawings are incredible, beautifully rendered. The illustrations should be made available as prints. And what a wonderful two person play this would make!"
5,The Diaries Adam and Eve,This is different from than anything I had read that Mark Twain has written. It puts a different perspective on what Adam and Eve's relationship could have been. It is also very insightful into the differences between men and women and how differently they are created. I love it!
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I'd love to say something good about this film but in truth I cant. Its so badly conceived from beginning to end that its simply embarrassing to watch all the way through. The films main failing is its script which is weak and unfunny. The two main stars are wasted on such an utterly pointless project. The only reason I watched it at all was that I remember watching this on TV when I was five or six years old and loving it. I should have left it at that. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland undoubtedly have good chemistry but if you want to see them together watch MASH, not this. Avoid."
4,The CVR400's not all that big.,"Bought the CVR400 case for a new Dell E1505. This computer, with a 15 inch screen, will not fit into the padded sleeve. It does fit into the case (barely), so I will go ahead and use the case since it has other useful features and I don't consider the padding essential. It appears to me that a fairly thin computer with a 15 inch screen might fit into the sleeve.Note that Amazon displays the same reviews for the CVR 200 case, the CVR400 case, the CVR217 case, and the CVR600 backpack (and who knows what else) even though they are all completely different products, so don't get confused when some of the descriptions don't fit."
3,"nice, but a bit too compact perhaps","<<Targus CVR400 15 CityLite Notebook Case>>This is very nice if what you want to carry with you is a 15in laptop, powercord, small mouse, plus some paperwork. There's no room for anything more, it's not really made for stuffing extra stuff. Even an extra paperback might be a bit too much.I find it just a bit too small for my use -- I'd have liked it to be a little bit fatter, so I can carry some extra stuff like a book, pill bottles, and such.One criticism: the strap is ok, but not as comfortable as you'd ideally want. I found it handy to take the strap off my old Lands End canvas briefcase and use that instead."
1,Big and Bulky!!!,"The pictures make the case look small, but it is actually very large and almost square. It is WAY TOO BIG for a 12"" laptop. The laptop fits in sideways, so the bag is much taller than it has to be in order to be functional.It is just too big to be awkward, but not big enough to fit textbooks, binders or anything else.YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!I had to return it and got screwed on shipping!!!"
5,Very Pleased,"The bag is exactly what I was looking for. It has a place for everything I have. I especially like the extra compartment to fit file folders (lots of room). The bag seems very durable as well. I have a 12in notebook (it can fit a bigger one), and it definitely seems safe and secure."
1,too small,"thought this case would be good for me, but cannot fit any accessories in it but just the laptop...oh well, mothballs in the closet til I throw it out.seems fine otherwise...just realize you cannot add your accessories like ac cord, external anythings, etc...good for an ipad I guess."
5,Wonderful Romantic story that is love to the max.!,Lilis was the most normal of the women in these stories. I would have to say from what of Susan Paul's work. She knows where love and life really cross roads with one another.
3,One very amazing track...,"Most of the tracks on Volume 4 are better in their originally released versions, including the stuff that ended up on ""Elvis Country"" with overdubbed horns. Unlike Volume 5, which shows EP in a very loose and funky mood, the tracks here just sound...professional. The one exception is the undubbed ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" with just Elvis, piano, bass, and drums. In this fan's opinion, this is the single greatest recorded moment of EP's entire career, and when he sings ""I'm on your side"", you'll know everthing the boy from tupelo was all about."
5,Essential Elvis Vol. 4: A Hundred Years From Now,I love my purchase. I listen to this CD everyday. I'm very pleased with my order and would recomend this Cd to others
3,Disco Fans? Tall Pall crazy?,"Well what can i say this CD isn't all that, I'm not a great disko fan, so the first CD of Blocko totally killed me, Although Tall Paul came out with a good set, I expected more. If you can get the second CD by itself get it."
4,cute plates.,I'm pretty satisfied with this one.there's several spots on the plate.quality is not that goodbut you get what you paid for. :)
5,BEAUTIFUL,"I ordered this set and it is even more beautiful in person. It came verytimely, and packed securely. No chips or breakage. I have ordered otherpieces and am most pleased."
4,"lovely pattern, high quality china","I ordered a whole set from amazon, besides this I also got serving ware, glassware, and more dinner ware (pasta set, rice bowls, etc). lenox has delivered something of high quality. pretty happy with this purchase."
5,6 stars!,"This dinnerware set is the most beautiful and fine china set I have ever laid eyes on! When it arrived I was even more impressed because it looks even better than the photo. The price here is very good as well and I am very, very happy and proud to have such a unique and great looking set. All of my friends noticed it and said compliments about it. Highly recommended."
3,"call me spoiled, but....","i want a great plot/thrills & chills, welldrawn interesting characters, AND great writing with atmosphere. this got such great reviews i bought it immediately, but while there are some interesting murders, the writing is not up to my standards (Darian North, Michael Connelly, T. Jefferson Parker, etc) and was a disappointment. a mediocre time killer."
5,true statement for anyone who has had to let anyone go.,this is one of the best songs by Tim McGraw he keeps getting better and better. I hope to hear a lot more from him in the future.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"It's a shame this song isn't going to get the publicity such songs as ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" will and are getting. This song puts those other songs to shame! I get chills and goosebumps everytime I hear this song. This song touches me deeper and deeper everytime I hear it, and in different ways each time. I just hope at next year's award shows, credit will be given where credit is due and his song will reap a basketfull of awards. This is truly a classic song for all times and perhaps the best masterpiece Tim has ever done. Certainly the greatest song to come out of Nashville in quite a while. Truly amazing! If you don't own ""A Place in the Sun"", then you are being deprived of some of the greatest music to ever come of Nashville."
5,Nice,"Another great Liquid Sound Design Mix. again,.... Collect all you can!Listening to Snap Ant's ""Queen of No. 18"", truly delightful! Some other great chilly tunes on this one.Definitely a keeper!"
4,Good viewing- somewhat long,Great information. sometimes a bit long. More of a national geographic special than travel info. All in all informative information
1,ordered 24 got 21?,These come stacked on top of one another (supposed to have 12 in each case)12 in the top case only 9 in the bottom case. Really??? Very disapointed -
3,Good Korean period film,This story is about two men raised together as youths but now as adults become adversaries each a master swordsman and each one willing to kill to advance their cost. This film was made by Koreans who have a totally different look and feel to thier style of martial art film making. I am one who enjoys this style it's combat scenes are more agressive and the story lines are dark in comparision. I give this film 3 stars because the interplay between the actors sometimes is long and the fight scenes are good but not great.
3,Book is somewhat helpful.,"This book is somewhat helpful. I read it after reading ""Heal your Headache!"",which sort of set the standard.This book does contain some helpful tips but my impressions and observationsare that it is dancing around the fringes of the migraine root causes, whereas""Heal your headache!"" gets much closer to the real problem.You can't go wrong by reading this book, but it is not the final answer either."
3,sturdy heads,"these heads don't give the best sound, so i wouldn't use them for a concert, but they are tough, and very good for practice. They have good response, and feel. I really don't like the snare head though, which is why i said 3 stars. I hate the power dot thing."
5,Cats Meow with Tiger 07,"Ah, very nice. This is the most fun i've had on my 360 since Elder Scrolls Oblivion! A few of the other reviews i've read have stated that this game is extremely DIFFICULT, I would say it is now challenging and not extremely EASY like previous installments.The graphics are sweet! Shadowing is incredible, the details on all of the players is great and the surround sound is very cool!One thing that is pretty snazzy is the espn radio highlights you can recieve while your in a menu. I can get all of my scores and news while I customize my golfer or figure what type of game I am going to play.Sorry to the previous posters who gave this anything under 4 stars but your way off on this one! This is the best golf game since the Links series. It's worth the price!"
5,Tiger Fans,If you are a fan of the Tiger Woods series you will love this game. I got it as an Amazon deal of the day for $20 and have not stopped playing it since I recieved it.
4,Jazzy Jars are jazzy and more,The information in this book is very helpful. I used the info to create my own design. The book has great pictures so you can actually see the finished product. To view some of the jars I made go t[...]
5,Complete works of William Blake,"A wonderful paperback edition, containing all the works ofWilliam Blake, with a excellent introductionof Harold Bloom. An priceless tool for studentsand teachers"
3,"Great Songs, Lousy Sound.","This is a wonderful collection of hits from the Friends of Distinction, however it is marred by the poor sound quality of the reissue. The sound is thin, and the mix diminishes their vocals. Also, the dynamic range of this cd is closer to that of an LP. Sad, because their full sound doesn't come across on this reissue. This is truly unfortunate since the Friends were an incredible sounding quartet. In spite of the sound quality, this is still a valuable collection of hits from the early '70's. Besides, this stuff was produced before the crystal clarity of cd's. Enjoy it anyway!"
3,"Not A Bad Album, But Not A Good Album","I only bought this album because for some reason I thought that it had the song ""What Would You Say?"" on it. It didn't, but I wasn't totally disappointed. It did start off well with ""So Much To Say"" which is a decent song. ""Two Step"" was even better (the best song on the album). I must admit that ""Crash Into Me"" is a pretty good song and ""Too Much"" is also alright, but then, the album seemed to go into a six song series of album fillers and songs that were down right annoying. ""Tripping Billies"" (Track 11) was the only really good song after ""Too Much"". I guess ""#41"" wasn't too bad either. Overall, there are just too many bad songs on this album, ""Proudest Monkey"" being the worst. ""Under The Table And Dreaming"" is a much better album."
1,id rather litsen to nails down a blackboard,"this is such [...] how can anyone like this music. ive honestly never actually met anyone who said they liked the dave matthews band or many whove even heard of them. but the day i met that person i will smack them in the face and say ""what the hell is wrong with you?"" buy this album if you want to be a failure at life and have everyone make fun of you for litsening to such god forsaken music. it straight up sucks."
4,Dave just keeps getting better,"Crash might not be as commercially successful as Under the Table and Dreaming, and it may not be quite as radio friendly, but this album is deffinately a high water mark of the creativity of the DMB. Dave is a fine songwriter, his abilitis maturing in his old age. There is no ""Ants Marching"" on this album, but there is something much better. Actually musical ability. Go Dave, there are few in popular music that do it as good as this. Why didn't I give it five stars? Let's not get carried away now. This is a sweet album, but it's not The White Album. Gotta leave a little room for those extra special albums."
5,"""CRASH"" is number one even after all this time!","""Crash"" was the first CD I ever owned...now with over 200 in my collection, it is still my favorite. There is no better CD to own, whether you are currently a fan of DMB, or if even if you have never heard any of their songs. Any way you slice it ""Crash"" is the best...Nearly all of my favorite DMB songs are on this CD. ALSO...check DMB out in concert if you get a chance...they are great!"
5,"Even below their prime, DMB is the best.","This CD was what hooked me to DMB. It is truly amazing, and deep, emotional, and all that stuff. What really amazed me, though, was the musical talent of the band members. So many bands today have a guitarist and a drummer, neither really good. DMB has two guitarists, an INCREDIBLE drummer, a good bassist, an amazing violinist & an amazing saxophonist. I thought, these guys are the best.And then I got Under the Table and Dreaming, which has twice the talent. If you don't like Warehouse, you are not alive.Crash is actually dumbed down a little, but still reccomended."
1,So MAD,I ordered this to replace old one to find NO CD WHEN IT CAME. you would think they would check it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Uh...yeah,"uh.... I just wan't to say that the DMB is the dumbest band i've ever had the misfortune to hear. they give all musicians a bad name, and i think Dave Matthews should just stop writing music. If your thinking about getting a DMB c.d. DONT!! now, REAL music is bands like Everclear, Nirvana, Green Day, Weezer, The Living End, Collective Soul....... and on and on.....pretty much every band except DMB. except for rap. Rappers like Jay-Z and Snoop dog, and Sisquo should all be sentanced to death. they make me want to vomit all over my dog. Rap ""Singers"" are the only acceptions on a band thats worse than the DMB. and thats all....I think you get my point. I would give them 0 stars, or -5 but, I don't think you can......."
2,A Crash course in the Dave Matthews Band's career,"Would like to say first to reviewer ""Jim(Del Monte)"" that Pres. G W Bush has done a great work to revitalize and help grow economics in his great country, secure borders and begin to ""trim"" those terrorists (a point the disastrous Carter and Clinton administrations should not be proud of). I don't trust Kerry either.Concerning the album i've been rather deceived by the performance on Crash: The Matthews can do better. Perhaps theyve become too commercially blank;their political bias doesnt strenghten their art. They could be forgiven for supporting JK, but not for making a cd such as this one. For good RnR you ought to look elsewhere. Dave Matthews which i recommend, though: Live at The Luther or Live at Red Rocks."
5,The Best Ever Made,This CD really helped me through a tough time and I love is so much. I think that the different songs all give a different feeling towards the CD.I would really like to meet the person who created the cd because they seem really Artistic.
2,Inexcuseable,"The music is okay, but ""Lift up your skirt and show the world to me"" is the most flagrantly obscene lyric I've ever heard."
5,[People] speaks!,"As one of those [people] who owns every CD put out by the Dave Matthews Band, I have to say that Crash is easily one of my favorites. IT was the first one I got, and even though I sold it to someone else then (the shame!) when i suddenly came back to my DMB senses, it took back it's place as a favorite. The first track, ""So Much to Say"" sets the tone for hte rest of the CD. Truly a great road-trip CD. And supposedly it was ranked as the best make-out CD of all time... but I wouldn't know, honestly! :-)"
4,She loved it...,What more can i say? She loved it. It's even more beautiful up close than in the picture.
5,My Wife Loved It,Very nice item...my wife loved it.Excellent price and the quality seems quite good. The black pearls contrasted with the white and the double stranded necklace is quite striking.
5,Love it,I found someone on Craigslist that had one of these and got it for a good price. It is very well made and slides easily over the snow. My 22 month old daughter enjoys it a lot. It's great on a flat surface but can tip over on an uneven one. I love it.
3,Nice but will have to return,"As a previous reviewer stated, this is a nice sled but our 15 month old kept tipping over on uneven or unpacked snow. We ended up having to push her instead which was not as much fun. Maybe if she were heavier or could hold onto the sled to prevent herself from falling off it would have worked better. Unfortunately we had to return the sled. Quick ship and easy returns as always on Amazon."
5,Almost perfect,"Full of theatrical themes, big emotions, musical risks and wonderful M/F duets, SYoF is a masterpiece."
3,Iffy on the Stars 'Question',"I gave the cd a couple of listens. I want to like it a lot. I want to be enthused. And I do find the songs very pretty. However, it all seems very 'bland' and familiar, as if I've heard all of these songs done before by another band. Chances are, I have.The Stars crew manages to pull off the combination of male and female vocals though, as the two vocalists' voices mesh together very nicely."
4,Great voyage,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the story of the two youngest Pevensie children and their very obnoxious cousin on their return to Narnia. Caspian, now King, had sailed to find the seven lords that his father sent on an adventure but had never come back. The children joined him and the Knight Reepicheep, who is a talking mouse, on the ship The Dawn Treader to new adventures. From the discovery of new lands and their perils, slavery, new species and the truth of what happened to the lords... this book will keep you entranced and open your imagination to the outer most places. Great for anyone who enjoys traveling through CS Lewis' imagination.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The two older children from the other books have been given the arse from Narnia as they are now too old and boring to be allowed back. Different rules for lions, it seems.Anyway, the two younger are staying with an annoying cousin, and end up on a ship with Caspain, now a king, and a talking rodent.Ship quest time."
4,Great,"Actually, this was a gift. I do, however, recommend the Chronicles of Narnia series to anyone who likes adventure, fantasy, thrillers, or mysteries."
3,too much diary,"my dad read this to my brother and me. I liked the book, but not as much as the first three because there were too many pages filled with Eustace's diary talking about his boring time on the poop deck. I liked the dragon part, but the dufflepuds and their big foot were my favoritei would recommend this book to my friends but i think they have to read the whole series.caw"
5,Another OUTSTANDING series,"I've enjoyed all of the previous Rev. Clare Fergusson novels and this one was no different. Ms. Spencer-Fleming gets better and better with each book in this series. I enjoy this author and her series for several reasons which include great characterization, great church politics, towns people who populate her world and the ever-growing relationship between Clare and the police chief, Russ Van Alstyne. If you haven't started this series yet - your in for a treat. Start by reading the first book, IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER."
3,"fun read, story weak","well written and flows easily but story weak. I still enjoyed it though. Worth the read, liked the characters but set in a rural town, etc."
2,Out of the Deep I Cry...,I am on chapter 9 and I just want to put it down. Is it because I didn't read the first books by this auther. It is so boring and no I can't put it down because I think it has to get better. Just my opinion.OK now I am on chapter 13 and I can finally say it has gotten better. I would not read the book again as I like a book that gets me innterested in the first 2 or 3 chapters.Out of the Deep I Cry (A Rev. Clare Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne Mystery)
3,It Was Blah,"There is no doubt that Elizabeth Wurtzel is an educated woman. This shines in the book. Unfortunately, it's the only thing that shines.I can see how depressed teenage girls would fawn over this book, but for the rest of us, don't waste your money."
2,SO NOT ME,"i have been a depressed teenager sence i was 12-13 (about the time ms. wurtzel says she started getting seriously depressed. and i have had a knife to my wrist, i have spent whole weeks in bed and i know what it is like to look back and only be able to see your self this way. But in no way did i feel a conection with this girl, and i discourage people to read this book becasue they seem to think they come out with a better feeling and handle on how depressed people are, and my god that could not be farther from the truth, the only thing u can get out of this book in my opinion is what one girl, at different parts in her life thought as she tried to deal with her depression, that is it, i beg of u do not think u know more about being depressed if u have read this book."
3,Constant Intellectualizing,"""I did enjoy this book, however the author repeatedly denies alcohol/drug abuse/addiction throughout, and that is simply not the case, she is stoned, drunk or otherwise messed up ALL of the time! I truly believe that she needed to stop intellectualizing EVERY single thing, drop the resentments and accept some happiness in her life. But then all addicts believe that the world revolves around them.... Although I found this author's self-indulgence annoying most of the time, it is still worth the read, and her newer book, More, Now, Again is much better."""
4,pure nihilistic beauty,"The cover image. The title. The words. The sorrow. The self-abusing hatred. Beauty and the beast. Elizabeth Wurtzel - to love, to admire, to hate - physical and meta-physical. Read this before you judge me"
2,Blah Blah Blah Blah - Blah!,I was so conflicted over this book. I could relate to certain aspects and others were alienating - and thats ok - but this book is to be Wurtzel's 'Truth' yet it smacks of bullsh*t. Maybe this book was cathartic for her - but it was a waste of time for me. What's even more hilarious is that she is coming out with an advice book about life. Thanks but no thanks Ellie!
1,prozac nation,I saw the movie and thought the book must be even better...nope. It was like listening to a thirteen year old girl whine. It made me uncomfortable reading it she was trying so hard to be a good writer that I felt embarrassed for her. I stopped reading after chapter 1 and sold it to a book store for a dollar.
1,disjointed drivel,"Wurtzel can string a sentence together, but she cannot tell a story. Wurtzel's memoir of her own depression rambles so much that I had to force myself to finish half of it.It's hard to argue with a depressive. I know, I battled depression for many years, mostly in high school. No matter how smart, attractive and funny they may be, they just don't see it. However, I tired of the excuses when they came out of me, and I tired of them even quicker from Wurtzel.Wurtzel also launches into pointless, irrelevant tangents at random. I found it very hard to sympathize with her. Nothing she had to say was any more interesting than watching a dead houseplant. That is all I can bring myself to say about this one. ..."
4,nice book,"i read this several years ago and enjoyed it much more than i did when i recently re-read it...maybe a good book while still a teen trying to find your way, but once the realities of life hit you, most of this seems insignificant."
3,Objective and subjective all at once,"A very detailed memoir about living depressed that is interesting to read if you get into the story but disregard all the analysis. What you get out of her story is as good as it gets. Quite frankly, it's difficult to understand her because she chooses all the wrongs in her life which she then expands on and adds to her list of things that made her depressed. We seem to skip all of the brighter moments, such as making friends and getting into her dream school. The tone gets quite annoying if not for her way of defining society from such a skewed perspective. I do however like the ending, perhaps because I was pessimistic about her whining from the beginning. She seems to bring her story together, and yet at the point in her life when she wrote the novel she still can't look at her situation from the side and see its similarity to those of many people. I still recommend reading it as it is well-written and can be interesting."
2,Prozac Nation,"I picked this book off a summer reading list and I thought it was going to be some type of a documentary on prozac, so I was a little surprised when I started to read this book. I only got through the first chapter ""I Hate Myself and I Want to Die."" If you have dealt with depression, then this is a great book to read. Prozac Nation shows the reader the emptiness and lonesomeness someone with depression goes through."
5,"Pretty, nice quality","I bought the sugar bowl with the matching creamer after my kitchen was remodeled. I wanted something that would look nice on the counter and this fit the bill. It is big enough for our household and quite nice looking. Happy with the quality and appearance, would definitely recommend."
5,Great Moive,"The ""Occupy"" groups could take a lesson from this movie. Great history lesson. Hard to think these people paved the way for so many others."
4,Great double Disc,This is my Graduation disc because it seems like it came out around the same time I graduated I like this Cd pretty good not as good as 36 chambers but a good follow up great lyrics pretty good beats
3,THIS ALBUM WAS ACTUALLY KINDA POOPY......,"The rhymes on this double disk were great....but rza really slacked off on the production...and it destroys almost the whole feel of the disk and makes u not really care about the rhymes. Rza can do much, MUCH better than this!!!! Next wu album should be hot....check out ""gravel pits""."
3,forever,"the name of this double cd says it all: ""forever."" which is about how long it feels as though this double cd goes on for. and considering that there is just about enough really good material here for a single cd, that's not a good thing. while there are some great songs on here (triumph, mgm, etc.) it is just too bloated with contributions from people like cappadonna, killa priest, etc. who drag the album down. as somebody already said, if you can get it cheap, then do so. then burn all the really good songs onto a single cd and you'll be good to go."
1,Anthropoidian junk.,Bad vulgar poetry?Dumd ape-like subjectmatter?Montonous drum machine thud?If you like these things then you are perhaps the Missing Link or just someone who likes hearing something akin to a bunch of subhumans.
5,Wu-Tang Forever!,"Before this album the only Wu-Tang stuff I had heard was 36 Chambers. I loved that CD, so I borrowed my friend's Forever disc. It's just plain awesome. The first two songs (Reunited and For Heaven's Sake) totally blew me away. The beats dropped are sweet and you don't get tired of them. Then there's the lyrics. The rhymes are wicked, an incredible combination of raw verse and sophisticated references. But what do you expect from some of the best MCs ever?"
2,A weak sophomore effort for the Wu.,"I wasn't at all impressed with this album(s). Enter the Wu-Tang was a milestone in the hip-hop era with one great track after another and this is just... weak. There are a few decent songs here, including ""Reunited,"" ""The City,"" & ""It's Yours,"" but this double album could easily be pared down into one. The only real gem here is ""A Better Tomorrow."" It's easily one of the best rap songs I've heard in a long time. The single, ""Triumph"" in my humble opinion, just plain ... The Clan could use not only a real dj, but a producer who can tell good songs from filler garbage."
4,A very nice and serious book about Tantra traditions,A good book about Tantra traditions.There are few authors who write on this subject with seriousness and honesty. A book recomended.
1,Using Computers In Correspondence Play,"Wowie! This is a great book in showing you how to use a computer to win at correspondence or internet chess. The problem is that when I play correspondence chess or internet chess it is not allowed to use a computer during the actual games. I would think that this should have been pointed out instead of showing you how to use a computer to do this. Obviously anyone who wins using the computers is not really using his mind to be a winner, just tweaking a computer in the right way. I must object to the entire idea behind such a book. This is my opinion, but I think it is morally right."
1,Do Not Cheat at Chess - The Idea!,"I would never use a computer to cheat at chess. Why?Because I want to win on my own.Modern Chess Analysis shows you how to ""tweak"" your computer to make you win when you opponent doesn't know you are doing that.Become an GRANDMASTER in CORRESPONDENCE chess when it becomes who knows more about using computers when who knows about thinking about chess makings any title worthless in correspondence play (I understand this means sending your move by mail). That is the problem. How can it be controlled to prevent ""cheaters"" in chess is the theme of MODERN CHESS ANALYSIS."
4,Very encouraging book,"Borghild is a single woman. Her courage, great attitude, & perserverance in the face of blindness, while living alone in her own apartment, was very uplifting!"
4,Puzzle Is Okay,"I was so excited when I saw this puzzle online and didn't even realize it was a sound puzzle until I got it in the mail. Quick Shopping :) Anyway so I was very excited and put in a battery. The puzzle has sturdy pieces but the board is okay looks pretty cheap. The other thing I am not to crazy about is the puzzle will say incorrect shapes and will talk when no one is around which is pretty scarey if you are alone and you hear ""square""."
4,Great shapes,I love the audio but wish it would also teach colors at the same time. Is easy for little hands to grasp but need to be able to turn to find the correct way to place them.
2,Educational value lacking,"I provide math professional development to preschool teachers and was excited to integrate this toy into the materials that I use for shape learning. I thought this could teach children about shape when they are playing without a teacher guiding the instruction and it would be helpful to children who speak English as a second language. The MAJOR educational drawback to this toy is that no matter where the pieces are placed it will call out the name of the shape. This is a BIG PROBLEM in terms of teaching children the correct names of shapes! For example, if you put the octagon over the triangle it will call out triangle because the magnet triggers the voice prompt, NOT the puzzle piece being correctly inserted. I DO NOT recommend this toy because of this problem."
3,College Lab Student,"I am 6'2"" 200 pounds and I ordered this coat thinking it would be too big. Unfortunaely, it fits just right. Which means I can't have a sweatshirt on underneath. In the winter I will have to strip down to my t-shirt. Also the buttons are already starting to stretch, and the sleeves seem to be disproportionately short, even more so than normal lab coats. I give this coat a three because it does fit me, but it's docked for what I stated above. It is about three dollars cheaper than what my bookstore had, but this one has a chest pocket which is good for that street cred to impress the ladies..."
2,"""Me pido la ventana"" is 25% ""Pelota de Letras""","Bote el dinero a la basura con este DVD. Me sente con mis hijas a verlo y tuvimos que parar a los 10 minutos. Vi el resto solo porque insistia en recuperar mi dinero. Es muy vulgar y el Sr. Lopez raya en lo ordinario. Se le fue la mano en su egocentrismo y frustaciones. Me recordo los chistes denigrantes de algunos de mis amigos rolos. Se pueden rescatar algunos buenos trucos con la voz, ruidos en el microfono, y uno que otro apunte. Cambio la formula que hizo de Pelota de Letras un clasico."
1,Clarissa has aged poorly,"Although I love English literature, and have degrees in both English and French literature, I must confess I hated this book. It rambles on and on, with very little plot development or anything else to keep the reader's interest. It may be a ""snapshot"" of the time, but so many writers of the same era managed to do this within the parameters of books that are much more compelling and, yes, much shorter. Sometimes, less is, indeed, more. I recommend this book only to people who have nothing better to do than, say, read through the Oxford English Dictionary from front to back. Clarissa is only somewhat less compelling a read than the OED. Everubody else should try some Austen, Dickens, or Eliot."
5,Read the UNABRIDGED Clarissa!,"The UNABRIDGED Clarissa (Penguin ed.) is a powerful, moving eighteenth-century English masterpiece, the first great psychological novel. Its length may seem daunting and it does take at least six weeks to read, but you will be rewarded by finding yourself immersed in the minds of Clarissa and Lovelace. You will feel as though you are living in their world, facing their moral dilemmas, deciding on courses of action, predicting consequences. However, if you accidentally pick up the Sherburn ABRIDGEMENT of Clarissa, you will NOT be able to savor Richardson's famous ""writing to the moment."" If you doubt me, take a look at Mary Anne Doody and Florian Stuber's article, ""Clarissa Censored,"" in the journal Modern Language Studies (1988). The abridgement is a travesty of Richardson's greatest novel."
5,Star Trek: All Our Yesterdays,"This is one of my all time favorite episodes! It brings up the struggle of having too much power and the ability to abuse it, as well as the power of love to overcome!"
2,Big letdown from the second season,"The third, and last, season was in general a huge disappointment from the peak it reached in the second season. Some of the worst episodes of the series are found in the embarassing ""Spock's Brain"" and the unintentionally hilariously bad episode of the space hippies search for a nonexistent galactic Eden. There are far more disasters than Picassos in this season. It was evident that the writers and other creative people were running on fumes and the series clearly had jumped the shark. Stick with the first 2 seasons for consistent entertainment."
2,Out of Order,"Although it is real nice having the set in one package, it is a shame that they did not have the foresight to think we might want to watch them in the order they were numbered, i.e. episode 2 before 3, 3 before 4, 4 before 5, etc. They are on the disks in air date order, which is not the correct order, if you want to watch in actual order, you must juggle between disks. Wait to purchase until the idiots at Paramount get it right. Maybe this is why sales were not so good and went from $129 - $199 per season to less than $40.00 per season."
3,Two of the Weaker Eps from Season 1!,"If you are picking which Vols to keep, give this one a miss; coming immediately after the brilliant Vol. 8, the two eps here are amusing but little else. In ""Shore Leave"", we get a very realistic Holosuite with everyone's thoughts taking physical shape and with ""The Squire of Gothos"" we get the original Q-type alien. As I have always hated Q, this ep is one of my least favourite and it also rings too close to a much better Twilight Zone episode where the characters are also playthings of some other creature without their knowledge. Give this volume a miss."
2,Micheal Lewis can do much better,"I bought this book because I liked other book I had read by Michael Lewis and I thought the subject matter would make for an interesting story. This book is nothing like Michael Lewis' other books. The story telling is just not there. Just because you liked The Blind Side, Moneyball, or Liar's Poker does not mean that you will enjoy this book. In my opinion it pales in comparison."
3,Fairly interesting,"First off, this is not my favorite Michael Lewis book. Not even close. It definitely did not capture me the way that liars poker or the big short did. That said, it does a great job of showing that people seem to suspect about politics and why no one seems to pay attention.Well worth the read if you are interested in politics or if you have a good memory of the 96 election."
2,Good for the first two months...,"I purchased this lock for my commuter bicycle in Washington, DC in May. It seemed sturdy, did not have problems with the key breaking off in the lock (like many of its competitors), and was hefty but not too heavy. For the price, it seemed like a great deal in the beginning.Like some reviewers have said, the plastic piece that attaches the lock to the bicycle is not strong enough, so I had to either strap it to my bicycle's back rack or sling it over the handlebars. This was a minor hassle, but no big deal. Unfortunately, this abuse proved to be too much for the lock. Its cheap, internal plastic components must have cracked during one of my commutes, because when I got to work it completely came apart, revealing cracked plastic parts.If this lock cannot handle a few bumps on my 3 mile each way commute for 2 months, I do not trust it to secure my bike!"
1,LISA SEE DISAPPOINTING,"UNLIKE PREVIOUS BOOKS, L. SEE MADE THIS TRULY BIOGRAPHICAL. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SHE GETS CARRIED AWAY. FIRST, SHE LETS OUT ALL HER ANGER AT AMERICANS B/C OF THE TREATMENT OF CHINESE IMMIGRATING HERE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY JOBS AMERICANS COULD GET IN CHINA AND HOW WELCOMED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN. I GOT TIRED OF HEARING HER RANT ON AND ON ABOUT HOW THE CHINESE HAD IT SO BAD (SO DID OTHERS). SECOND, AT THE END, SHE JUST RAMBLES ON ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERY MEMBER OF HER FAMILY. WHO COULD REMEMBER THEM ALL? IT WAS POSITIVELY BORING! I'VE ENJOYED HER PREVIOUS BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS THE WORST. IF NOTHING ELSE IT GETS YOU ANGRY. DOES MS SEE UNDERSTAND MANY PEOPLE HAD IT ALOT WORSE AND STILL DO!"
2,On Gold Mountain,"I have read most of See's books and found them interesting and full of history; however, this one was just too deep for me and I didn't get very far before I gave it up."
3,On Gold Mountain is a slow read,"Lisa See is one of my favorite writers, and I had looked forward to this book for some time. She clearly did her research and gathered factual details to make it as accurate as possible. Unfotunately some of these details are tedious and hard to wade through. It seems she could have used a broader brush in several instances. The book is long, and it is a very boring read in some places, although if you stick with it, the story picks back up. On a more positive note, there is a good deal of attention paid to mixed Chinese-Caucasian marriages and some of the problems encountered there, and there is good attention to the interpersonal relationships between and among all of the characters. The action is just very slow and there is quite a bit of this book that I personally would have edited out."
2,Perhaps overrated,"The story is fascinating, but the writing was not. Contantly intertwining facts with the story, it was hard to focus on the primary elements. Too much of the feelings and thoughts were imagined, and not ""real"", even with all of the research that was done. The end got long-winded with all of the names that were before secondary. As this review is coming from a high schol senior, many would not trust the judgment here, but in defense of that, read it for yourself. This is a good story that could have been handled differently, and than gotten more literary attention, as it deserves."
4,not bad,Karma is what us R.S. fans have been waiting for for years. Excellent musicianship and great lyrics- a common thing for Rick and his band. I saw Rick in concert last summer and he put on an excellent show. I'd like to say to some of the other reviewers here (the Amazon reviewer also) that current music is not the only music in the world- some of us might enjoy this album as you so despise.
5,It's like it's 1984 and I'm in my Camaro again!,"This album rocks!!! You are the best, Rick. I love you. I haven't listened to much new music since I graduated high school in 1986, but I'm so glad I picked this up. I hear Billy Squier is coming out with another album soon. Yeah! These guys are my favorites! But radio stations are too busy playing grudge rock and Limp Biscuit to play something like this. They are SO clueless."
3,Good press with a terrible handle.,"The press functions well enough, but as other reviews have mentioned the handle is shotty. It's held on with bolts which get gunked-up with grease and crud. I have to disassemble the handle (with tools) to clean the press thoroughly. The coiled handle doesn't stay cool enough to touch anyway, so why not use a one-piece design like the Lodge panini press? One good bonus this press offers is I can use it as a lid for the Lodge 6.5"" skillet, which doesn't have an available lid."
4,"Works well, but","A little too heavy, and for the price, I expect not to have to put the handle togeather. However, it works ok, just not for some things, like bacon, its just too heavy and the result isn't good with that."
2,Screws Loose,"The Press part is well made, but the screws holding handle on don't fit it holes very well. I couldn't get the screws to tighten up. The flat head screws are too small for the holes. I went to hardware store and bought larger screws. Not it's excellent with new screws."
4,Too Hot To Handle,"This press does what it's supposed to, but make sure to wear an oven glove with the handle during use."
4,Great book,"I enjoyed this book because of the great photos and details. As a toy lover and collector, I can appreciate the authors' memories of collecting and the interesting facts about Fisher-Price. It's a great portable reference to take with you to garage sales or flea markets! The colorful pages and concise information make the world of Fisher-Price toys come alive. It's been a wonderful edition to my library."
2,Makes Water Brown,"I soaked this wood for 60 days in a bucket, changing the water just about every day in an effort to make it suitable for aquarium use. It is still turning the water brown each day and I don't know if any amount of soaking will make it ready to put into an aquarium."
2,A tapestry of life in a Naples slum,"A maze of intertwining parallel stories, intersecting time and again, against the mad, sultry backdrop of life in the slums of Naples, the city for which Griffin apparently has special affection. Some of the twists in the story are somewhat too tall to be palatable, and the end is nothing if not contrived. Certainly the plot itself is no reason to read that book - but Griffin's sure-footed portrayal of scenes and characters might offer some incentive."
4,Big messy brawling genius of a book,"I happened to pick this up in the library -- I dont think anyone had taken it out for 20 years -- as I was embarking on a trip to Naples. Don't go to Italy south of Rome without reading this wonderful book and immersing yourself in the lives of these fabulous characters. Griffin wrote beautifully, and I'm surprised this book isn't more well known. It proves, once again, that if you want to understand the Italians read what a Brit has to say about them!"
5,A Great Piece of Music,"I got this CD for my birthday,having onlyheard the song 'It's alright,it's ok'.Youwill not like the CD from the first timeyou listen to it,cause this are not easysongs. But after a while the songs begangrowing on me. Leah is an unusual singerand I think if only more people knew hermusic she'd become really famous.Lovely!"
2,"works great at first, but then...","We received this wok as a wedding present about seven years ago and I must say that at first I was delighted. The wok conducts heat very well, it is a very useful size and the ridges inside helped hold cooked food up on the pans sides while you did other things in the hot well at the bottom. However those ridges turned out to be the pans downfall. Most asian recipes call for very high heat which can carbonize food on the pan. And once this happens you cant get the carbon out of the ridges no matter what you do. Presently, you will find big carbon flakes in your finished dishes (what is that - pepper? my husband asked). Brushes, scrubbers, even wooden skewers used point first couldn't clean the problem. I bought a replacement pan with a smooth surface - problem solved."
1,Sticky Stir Fry,"I agree with the ratings given by the enthusiast from Oak Ridge. Within a month of use, foods started to stick to the pan. Stir frying doesn't work in a sticky pan! Plus, with the ridges, it's a chore to clean. And this is a non-stick. I gave up using it for stir fry, but that's why I got it in the first place."
2,never again,"I had a larger circulon wok and used it almost everyday for about 6 months before the nonstick coating started to peel away. Once that coating gets a little scratch in it then it seems to gradually unravel. After about a year I threw it away. If you are tough on your cookware, as I am, then this is definitely not the choice for you. Another friend of mine also had the same experience and returned her circulon cookware to the store-and she tried to pamper her cookware. Plus I can't stand those ridges, the sauce and little bits of food get stuck in them."
3,Doomsday - but is it for real?,"Having read the book in 2008, and knowing that Mr. Kunstler wrote it 4 years earlier, the writer is very astute in correctly forecasting the sub-prime/debt crises and the oil price increases.He does a credible job of explaining why oil may not be there for all time. Unfortunately, his treatment of the alternative fuel and new technologies is rather brief and he seems to dismiss any solution, as it would interfere with his relished doomsday scenario.Kunstler brings up valid points, but his suggested outcome (a return to a version of an 18th century rural lifestyle) is rather far fetched and does not do justice to mankind's creativity and tenacity in addressing the real energy challenges we are faced with."
3,Authors bias spoils the message.,"The book is worth a read. But he seems to have a really elitist attitude to many of his fellow citizens from the south and West of your country which I found annoying. I can imagine how they would feel about it. The problem I have with this book and a lot of the other books on Peak Oil is the authors seem to think that they are going to continue to live their middle class existence with only a few solar cells and a double barrel shotgun to protect them. When a society collapses the most dangerous people running around will be unpaid former soldiers who will be well armed and skilled in the use of arms. The type of scenario you may see will resemble what went on in the Thirty Years war in Europe only with automatic weapons. An excellent old movie illustrates this scenario ""The Last Valley"" with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif. Left wing authors seem unwilling to look at the harsh realities of societal collapse.The Last Valley"
5,Deja vu chicken little,"All us hippies from the 60's can feel validated somehow, even while we suffer along with everyone else, or worse, because we are old, we can at least say I told you so. The sky is falling, as I have been saying for the last 30 years."
3,No Shortage of Electricity (Oil=3%),".________Data for 2001_____________Share (%) of Industry Net Generation by Energy Source___Coal=51%Nuclear=21%____Gas=16%___Hydro=6%_____Oil=3%___Other=2%Problems that America will face, will be the shortage of fuel for vehicles.Only 3% of our electricity is generated from oil."
5,I liked the Kindle version so much I bought the print version too,"I love your big picture and the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate situations, actions, and events. The paving of roads increases rain runoff, global warming causes rainfull instead of snowfall in California reducing the amount of fresh water stored in the snowpack, to name a couple. Up til now, my head just wasn't shaped right to pick up on such things. I watched the TV series, Connections, with James Burke back in the late '70s and you've captured, in print, that same phenomenon of interconnectedness. At the end of each telecast I used to think, ""Wow, I never thought of that."" You've got me thinking it all over again. Thanks for one hell of a ride.James Ide, The Nintoku Incident"
3,Quaking in my stylish yet affordable shoes,"Mr. Kundstler is very much on the pessimist side of the debate when it comes to predicting the impact of the global oil peak. This is not to say that he is wrong, but rather that many disagree with him, and often produce more evidence than one can fit into a well written, but fluffy short book. And this is nice to know, because frankly, the future he is prognosticating, and the immediacy of it, scares me right out of my stylish yet affordable shoes.Although he'd call me an idealist, I'm confident humanity will become more and more environmentally conscious and efficient at tearing up the planet to obtain the vast remaining repositories of fossil fuel, which, by the way, ought to last for a couple hundred years. By that time we better have solved our energy needs via non-renewable sources, or nuclear power on the moon, or something... Or else it really will be curtains, a la Jared Diamond's Collapse."
3,"Jerry Lee is great, some sound quality is not great","This is worthwhile for Jerry Lee Lewis fans. But I was surprised that the sound quality of the early songs wasn't electronically enhanced to a higher level. And I didn't see the great theatrics of Jerry Lee playing the piano with his feet, etc. The interviews were interesting and true to form. I am still laughing where he noted that his cousin turned 14 the day after they married but none of the press would report that!"
2,Not good enough,"I tried the game and it dissapointed me. It is pretty much the same old game, same goals as always. The game has all the liscences, stadiums, chants...EVERYTHING...but they missed the most important part wich is: SOCCER. The gameplay is not realistic, its robotic. Guys at EA should try Winning Eleven, its more realistic and there are no two ""same"" goals there. I had been a Fifa fan since 1995, but everytime I buy this game, I end up playing it 3 weeks (because I start winning matches 11-0 once I learn the ""trick"" to score the goalkeeper) and then switch back to winning eleven wich is more challenging."
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be,"I'm not much of a soccer fan so that could be why I don't like it as much as others might. I do enjoy playng sprts games and sim games, that's why it sounded interesting. The sim part is better than the game play itself. Being in control of the behind the scenes of the soccer team is fun, but the game play is a little difficult and the controls could have been layed out better."
2,Classic Star Trek in Blu-ray,"As a longtime Trekkie, I hate to write anything negative about it. However, my comments are directed only at the quality of the Blu-ray reproduction. Most of the bright, indoor scenes are crisp and clear as you would expect on Blu-ray. On the other hand, some of the darker special effects shots look like you're viewing them through a screen door. The lights and stars are not steady, but tend to flicker. This problem does not exist on every episode with every special effects shot, but it should not exist at all. I've noticed this on some other Blu-rays I've purchased in the past so it's not uncommon. Whatever the cause, I suspect it has something to do with the manufacturer going for quantity over quality. If you have a standard DVD set with the enhanced special effects, don't bother with Blu-ray. There's very little to be gained for the cost."
2,"No ""Play All"" Feature!","I'm going to make this short because we all know what the product is and we love it (Star Trek I mean and not this offering by Paramount).I used to LOVE to put on a video tape of Star Trek episodes and watch them to my hearts content into the night until I'd fall to sleep as they dutifully played on, one after the other.THERE IS NO OPTION TO "" PLAY ALL "" EPISODES ON A DISK!!You have to babysit this disk and start each and every episode by hand or it will default to it's main menu and wait!What was Paramount thinking? This ""Play All"" feature is a given on virtually all episodic DVD sets!I wish I could get my money back and wait until they redo this set right."
5,The Original is still the best.,"What can one say about Star Trek: The Original Series that has not already been said? Nothing against the Next Generation, but the Original is still the best. This is where it all began. It's great to have all the classic episodes in an excellent compact package of DVDs. I have always loved the banter between Spock and McCoy as well as Kirk's relationship with each of them. The Romulans, the Klingons, the Gorn, Tribbles: now they're all preserved on DVD."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,The blu-ray cut of this series is NOT up to standards. You will find that the scenes in episodes will loop back and then continue making watching this very difficult. I expect higher standards from CBS Video/Paramount when asking so much money for this product.
3,crappy casing,"I bought this 3 set series for my dad, and although so far the actual show seems great, picture is wonderful, BUT the casing is horrible. i wish i had noticed it right away but sadly i didn't until we all sat down to watch it . the casing has a crack in it and the case inside holding the dvds had cracks in the top as well. the dvds were put in wrong to so when we put it in the dvd player it wasn't reading it. luckily it hasn't seemed to skip but weve only watched part of the first dvd of season one. when we were putting it away though the box holding the dvds kept falling apart and took us forever to get the box clasped shut without falling apart. we are going to keep it but we may at least switch it to a better box. for the cost though the box should have been better quality since it stores the dvds."
4,Waiting for Remastered Version,Another reviewer pointed out the flaws in the video and sound. I too agree and will wait for the remastered version to purchase - then I'll be happy.
4,"Great, with one exception ...",First off let me say that The Franchise continues to milk Star Trek for every last drop it can get. My devotion to the show is the only thing which allowed me to shell out 200 clams. Overall the Picture quality and the new effects are great. However I amdisappointed that they chose to use 4:3 instead of the much better 16:9. And they rub your nose in it 'cuz much of the seriesfootage seen in the Special Features DOES USE 16:9 :o( Boooooooooo ! Hisssssssssss!
5,I don't see how it could be any better than this!,I can't really add anything to the praise that has been heaped upon this series all these years except to say that I (barely) remember seeing it when it originally aired and have seen it in many repeats over the years on different channels and it has NEVER looked nor sounded any better than this.
1,WHAT'S UP WITH THE PRICE?,IT'S IDIOCY IF YOU BUY THIS PACKAGE WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN BUYING ALL THE SEASONS SEPARATELY. MAKE IT WORTH IT TO US! BRING DOWN THE PRICE! DRASTICALLY!
1,Why Paint A Moustache.....,"Perhaps I do wrong to put down this Blu-Ray set without seeing it, but after hearing that Star Trek has been CGIed, I said to myself....Crap...NOTHING is sacred anymore...In short, if this set does not contain the original unaltered versions, I won't buy it... The new versions might be a curiosity and provide a new perspective of the originals, but that is the extent of it. As for me, I want to see the Tholians build that web the old way, and my stomach turns to think they altered it. The next thing they'll want to do is CGI the crew out of those classic Red uniforms...and CGI Bill Shatner out of the captain's chair and replace him with Kate Mulgrew (who the hell is she?)...LOL"
1,disks seem OK but of the three boxes the disks came in two are trash when they got here. Not happy.,"When I opened the first blue Disk box a hand full, not exaggerating a Handful of blue plastic shards fell out. The rods that hold the disk “pages” in the box were shattered, the disks look OK but the box that holds them is trash. The second box I opened seemed OK but the third is split up the back hinge so only the cover that holes the label is keeping the two parts together. Again the disks seem OK but of the three boxes the disks came in two are trash when they got here. Not happy."
3,My first Dimension extreme,"The story of the woman and the man who keep her with him in the woods, added with gore, and you have a verry good movie."
2,saw in the woods?,"Is the only way to describe this,though its no where near as clever as any of the saw films.The beginning of this movie shows Hope(a single mom) on a date.Next thing we know she wakes up buried alive not knowing what has happened to or where her daugher is..A man lets her out kind of only to tie her up to a tree and tell her she must cut it out to survive.This scene where she cuts out some of her own intestines is really the only good part of the movie.There are some other bloody moments where a shin bone gets smashed.We never really get any backstory on the man who captured her but we do find out he has some other victims.They kind of develop an odd relationship and eventually it comes to a boiling point with a twisted ending.Overall it had promise but ends up being rather slow and boring.Rent this if you can't find anything but don't buy this"
5,Super Cool,Very good projector. no thaving much review on the net. So i am doing.Build quality is very good. very small. makes people excited. Virtually no warm up and cool down period. Image quality is good. not so bright but good performance at specified limitA good buy and Amazon ships the cheapest Pk10 s
5,"A staple in any party-cd collection, an unsung classic...","It's not bubble gum, thank god, and it's not your normal blend of todays techno-garble. This CD is a fountain of energy and a scream-it-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-while-driving experience, while at the same time somewhat sexy with tracks like ""Wrapp"" and ""Don't You Ever"". For those who like ""Ready To Go"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", there's much more to this CD than just those two chart-toppers, so be sure to push play and let it run all the way through, I guarantee you'll hit repeat, more than once."
2,Crapola,"There is a reason why you can get this disc for 1 cent plus shipping, this disc and this band suck big donkey rod. If you can't get Ready to Go out of your head (which I grooved to after watching the video on VH1 Jukebox, the chick looked sooo hot), than get the disc. Just know that you will never replay the other tracks after you hear them once."
4,Good party music...,"Great music to get up and dance to. Techno mixed with hard-sounding guitars, upbeat tempos, lyrics to party to...basically what good party music is. ""Ready to Go,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and ""Out of the Darkness"" are the best songs here. I'm ready to go...let's party."
5,Great Tool,"I haven't finished reading this book yet, but I have read some sections. It is a great tool for anyone interested in improving the readability and flow of their writing. It is definitely worth the money, and you can find it for a really low price here on Amazon!"
5,"My favorite Cookware Line, unfortunately discontinued","Not All-Clad (which I love) or any cookware line yet has gotten even close the quality of this line. I only have 3 pieces, the saucier, the 2qt saucepan and the large fryer with cover.I'm forever searching for more pieces."
4,Great book for homeschool,"We used this set to fulfill homeschool high school Health requirement. It was easy to read and follow. I recommend this for a student who merely needs the health requirement, and is not interested in a health industries career. I would say the reading level is at about 6th grade."
2,Could use an update,Some of the basics are still relevant but this book could use some updating since 1997. Also more information on how to figure out how the servers are performing would be nice.
4,the most intelligent response to Bookchin yet published,"Don't believe the vituperative bile of orthodox social ecologists on this book. The mere fact that they're so peeved means the book is good. Murray Bookchin has systematically attacked all his former students who have disagreed with him in even the slightest ways, typical of totalitarian minds or whining leftists everywhere. John Clark and other former students who contributed to the volume have been systematically cast off from the fold. This book dares to take social ecology seriously, with great respect to Bookchin. To take the approach seriously, you may start with Bookchin, but should go beyond Bookchin. It's such a shame that such a smart man has gotten so full of himself that he can't take even a whiff of criticism. May social ecology evolve, thrive, and move beyond its cranky founder at last! This book shows the way..."
3,its too big,something has to be done about the sizing charts amazon has on their website. this was way too big for what it claimed. I am in the process of returning....well see how that turns out
3,Cute but flawed,Before opening this costume I rated it well. After putting it on my daughter I found many flaws. Luckily I am a sewer and can fix the problems. But I was sad to find so many tears and loose threads and pieces that needed to be reattached.
3,Good,Velcrow in back of neck was super scratchy. But we were able to remover it and put a snap instead.
2,Get a good flat rock...,"The Good:Turtle liked ability to get out of water. Self-leveling feature kept dock level with water changes.The Bad:Dock tended to grow greenish algae that stained. Attempts to wash helped somewhat, but high effort. Dock had a finish on the bottom that came off in chunks. Turtle decided he preferred the dock to his turtle bone for gnawing purposes, leaving chunks of plasticky (is that a word?) crap floating around the tank. I can't imagine that is healthy for him.Musings: Get a big flat rock that slopes. It looks better, your turtle will like it better, the finish won't come off, and any rocky field is a potential source. It will also retain the heat from a heat lamp, leading to praise from your turtle!"
2,Turtle Floating Dock,This product is design for turles I have a red ear slider turtle and she does not fit on the dock. I was disapointed for the actual size of the Dock.It would be great for a baby turtle but not for an 8month read ear slider.
1,amazon should fix this listing NOW,"I believe that it's impossible for this battery to be Litium Ion. If, as one reviewer states, the battery is NiMH, then AMAZON should fix this and fix it NOW. In its current form, it's false advertising."
1,Looks nothing like that,"They sent me some random log granted it is ""mopani"" wood my piece looked like a piece of fire wood. It was literally straight with zero curvature if it was a more expensive piece I would have def sent it straight back."
4,Beautiful marble chess set,"This set is beautifully crafted, pieces have nice weight. Would make excellent gift for avid chess player as well as a gorgeous coffee table piece. Wish there was better quality control of the product. Received the set in a timely fashion from an excellent seller (theredseahorse), however, the one of the king's bases was wobbly and the king tilted. If you purchase for a gift, open it first and set it up to make sure it's satisfactory. The seller gladly replaced the piece and the recipient of the gift described it as ""elegant"". One other detail about the color of this particular set (black and green), the two shades are not as contrasting as I thought they would be. Hopefully, that won't be a problem during a game:/ Aesthetically, however, the colors and set are beautiful!"
2,The True Story Of Spit Mac Phee,"The True Story Of Spit MacPhee by James Aldridge is based on a young boy named Spit who is brought up by a series of different people during his adololesance. This novel appeales to the older and younger generations in different ways. The way in which Spit deals with the contraversial religious attitude thrown towards him is a true inspiration.Although this novel had an interesting plot, it did not appeal to me. Of course i am speaking from a younger persons perspective and i think a major factor to my opinion is the time and scene in which the novel is set. The novel was an easy read although because of the time in which the book was set, the language made the book less interesting and even a little boring. There was a lack of true excitement and adventure and because of this, the novel wasn't a satisfying read."
4,The True Story Of Spit Macphee,I thought the novel was very captivative and hard to put down. I enjoyed it and i would have to say it is probably one of my favourite books. At the end of every chapter it would leave you on the edge and eager to read some more and of course you would because once you start you can't stop. I advise you that if you haven't read this novel (or even if you have)to write down some points as you go along just so you can remember what happend in the last chapter as the book can leave you abit confused and out in the open because every chapter is so jam-packed with surprises that you never would have guessed what's around the corner. So read it!! By Nick
4,REVENGE OF GTO,"After surviving a assasination plot by his homeroom (they tried to mix a cockroach into his food), GTO's job is in trouble. In the previous volume GTO helped one of his students named Noboru Yoshikawa take revenge on a trio of girls who abused and humiliated him. One of the girls told her influential mom about what he did and she is out for his blood. After that crisis Gto continues to try to win over the hearts and minds of Class 4, especially the constant hostility of its ringleader, Kunio Murai. It doesn't help that he has a thing for Kunio's young and beautiful mother. The thing about Gto that makes it funny is that he considers himself a pervert but he's nothing compared to the principal who longs for his own daughter or the track coach who is just there to check out girl's legs. Put into the mileiu of what he THINKS he is, Gto finds out that his lust is replaced by caring for his students. Another volume in a very entertaining series."
1,horrible,"This was not a ""Sunkist"" product. They all tasted the same like those cheap jelly beans. False use of the name."
4,"If you light tight '50s harmonies, you will love this","Very tight 1950s style harmonies, fun rock! This is a little gem that is worth a listen! The high voice is female in this group which makes a difference from the sound of the Lettermen etc...I really liked My Foolish Heart a lot."
4,A great Unreal Tournament...,I really enjoyed playing Unreal Tournament 2004 for the Pc because it was a great game and didn't stray too far from the original Unreal. Of course the graphics and physics got alot better but the core and essential part of this great game stayed with it and that's why i believe it is a fun game.
5,Great Standalone Morrison,"This is a great early Grant Morrison comic that perfectly represents his style. The artwork is fantastic, perhaps the best ever associated with his work. The story is bizarre, twisted, utterly confusing for stretches, in other words typical Grant Morrison. It can best be described as a metafictional mystery, i.e. a comic about comics. Its a theme that's been done to death, but in this instance its handled well. The incredible level of detail in the art doesn't hurt either. Overall, this is well worth picking up."
2,Couldn't get into it - not for those unfamiliar with Flex,"I liked the 'comic book within a comic book' aspect of this story, but since I wasn't familiar with Flex Mentallo or Doom Patrol at all, I was pretty much lost and couldn't get into it, and I really tried.I would only recommend this for those familiar with those comics/characters."
3,subtitles,the movie is very good. only problem is having to read the english sub-titles. the premise of the movie was very good. just wish i had been warned about sub-titles.
3,must have been a copy,"Gods and Generals was great until i flipped the dvd to play the rest of the film. about scene 45 the movie stopped and i was watching an episode of WonderWoman. So, I have not seen the end of Gods and Generals. I think this vendor should send me a new copy of that movie.!!!!!!! 2/9/2013 I received my refund. That makes the order rating better."
3,Great vest,"I just got this vest yesterday for Christmas and it is great! It holds every thing that I need. Very comforable. Also provides great protection. I can also move around in it and still run quickly with it on. Buy this vest, its awesome!"
5,Great Book,This was the first book I had ever read by (or about) the Dalai Lama. I thought it was a great introduction to his life and his way of thinking. Overall I thought this was a great book. I think everyone should read it.
5,I love the Dalai Lama,"This is the 2nd book by the Dalai Lama that I have read. It made me feel as if I was there with him all the way. It made me feel like flying the Tibetan flag and shouting ""Freedom for Tibet!"" I love this book. I love the Dalai Lama"
3,Be aware that this is not fragrance free,"It has a nice, mild herbal smell, but it definitely is not fragrance free. The packaging on the deodorant even says fragrance free. They lied. I have also noticed, which others do not have, a rash. I also tried MenScience Advanced Deodorant-2.6 oz and it too is not fragrance free. The only alcohol free and fragrance free deodorant which I have ever found that does work is Trader Joe's deodorant (the one in the blue and white package) (and if Amazon sold it I would buy it from them)."
5,Excellent flavored vinegar.,Purchased for a sweet vinagrette dressing of a new recipe for strawberry and spinach salad. Good recipe and the raspberry flavored vinegar was loved by all.
3,"Have read, all propaganda (surprised?)","Entertaining book but mostly wishful thinking and propaganda. I have lived and worked in Venezuela for the past 4 years and know exactly what is going on there. Hugo Chavez is NOTHING close to a hero. He gives the poor a crumb, but because they have never been given a crumb to eat before, SOME (and only very few) believe he is good for the country. He is a socialist dictator, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Christ, he's best buddies with Fidel who is a dictator. In the future, don't write a review if you don't know first hand (for more than a vacation) what is going on there."
5,Awesome RPG,This game is a mixture of Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate. The monsters in the beggning are easy and its very hard to die. If you are a serious RPG Gamer than you have to have this!!! This game also works brilliently in Mac OS X!!!
3,Worked for me,I wore these at work for Halloween in 2006. They worked for a temporary costume shoe but I would not want to wear them for more than a few hours. They had no support and it kind of felt like I was wearing cardboard-soled slippers.
5,Evocative illustrations and text,"I bought this for my nephew's 2nd birthday (which was, coincidentally, spent in India during the monsoons). I almost wanted a copy of it for myself, so evocative were the illustrations and text. My nephew is almost 4 and his parents tell me that it is one of his favorite books. He's at an age where the appeal of a book does not of course lie in the memories it evokes, but in how captivating the the illustrations and the story are. I have to add that this is not one of those tiresome books that presents India as the exotic land of snakes and snake-charmers, and that in itself is a huge selling point."
5,Remastered is Better,Got all of the series on hd dvd set Star fleet would be proud with the service quality packing and on time of this series and a happy customer.
5,One of the best Originals!,William Marshall with his obvious Shakesperian background performs very well in this episode. His emotions explode and is gripping. It's worth watching.
1,"Zero points, because flash is required!","Great show, but you really need to go on over to Hulu+ to watch it because AMAZON STILL REQUIRES FLASHPLAYER TO WATCH THEIR CONTENT! Android devices like the Google Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 are not supported.Dumb.Get an app, Amazon."
5,Awesome,"I love the stories, what can I say.... whether to get involved or not, what is right what is wrong? It's my cup of tea, maybe not everyone's.... Amok Time was awesome, Mirror Mirror was pretty cool, and IMudd was humorous oh and journey o Babel was cool because it involved Spock's parents ^_^"
4,Seriously glorious... with two exceptions.,"Everything about this set is fantastic, except that for some reason the episodes ""Amok Time"", and ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" (both enhanced and original versions) won't play on my machine. I don't know if it's a problem with the discs or with my player, as I haven't tried to play them on a different one. But all other episodes from the Season 2 set play fine... as well as those on both Season 1 and Season 3 sets, so I'm inclined to think it's a problem with the discs."
1,On Packaging...(Season Two),"BLU-RAY: 5+ stars for the show and content, but 1 star for the packaging. Out of the 7 BD, 6 are secured and locked down in the case, BUT the 7th disc is in a paper sleeve (unlike Season One... I haven't seen the packaging for Season Three yet) Why??? Did the manufacturers buy the wrong cases, but were too cheap to send back, so they throw the 7th disc in a paper sleeve??? This is horrid packaging and I've never seen such an example of neglect as they did with this release. Also, the disc and episode listings are obscured and printed on the inside half of the cover (like the other seasons). Therefore, you need to remove the discs to read the not-so-easy listings and descriptions."
5,"the writing started to slip some,but on the whole the second is just fine","as the second season got started it looked like it was going to be another great season,but as time went on the stories began to slip into the realm of lost in space,but don't get me wrong this season was still a very good one and as i love trek i love this season but you could see the quality begen to slip some as the season went on. not as many extras as the first season but still a great set."
4,Bought for a friend,"I bought this for my friend, who is a Huge fan of Star Trek. He was delighted by it, and couldn't wait to see the enhanced version of ""The Doomsday Machine"", one of his absolute faves from the Original series.For myself, I enjoyed it too... only thing is, I now have to get the other 2 enhanced seasons for my friend....I told him ""We'll see..."" heheheh!I recommend this, if you're a fan, or if you're getting it for a fan. If not, why are you looking up Trek? lol."
5,Star Trek season 2 DVD is fantastic!,"Star Trek Season 2 DVD set is fantastic! This is great Star Trek DVD set to own! You have the original cast in their younger days back in the 1960s! William Shatner is Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy is First Officer Mr. Spock, Deforest Kelly as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and the rest of the original cast! Some of the great episodes in Star Trek Season 2 are Amok Time, The Domesday Machine, Mirror, Mirror, Journey to Babel, The Trouble with Tribbles, The Ultimate Computer, and Assignment: Earth! Mirror, Mirror is one of my favorite episodes of Star Trek: TOS! Buy it! Highest Possible Recommendation!"
4,Good grief - I've been suckered in again!,"Well, yes, I was one of the stupid consumers that bought an HD player for the sole purpose of playing the first season in Hi-Def. What adds insult to injury is I purchased the player from Amazon in anticipation. Since the player arrived before the release of the 1st season, I was slightly too early on my HD player purchase to qualify for the phaser remote promotion. Why didn't Amazon warn me???!!Anyway, I'm stuck with an HD player (and yes I own a blu-ray too, I'm that stupid), and while the discs are beautiful, I was nervous when the announcement was made to scrap HD players. So, I am thankful they will be released, even if it is just in Standard def. Please, please - I hope they don't eventually put them on Blue-ray. A stupid consumer can only take so much!"
3,Most of these reviews are about the Bluray format and not the DVD,Before you form an opinion based on the reviews be aware that most of the reviews listed are from reviews for another product - the 2nd season Bluray format - and not the product listed - Season Two DVD remastered edition -i.e. Of the eight one star ratings 50% (4) are about the bluray format. I'm sure you know that the bluray format cannot be equated to the dvd format in terms of video and audio quality. So buyer beware! or properly informed at least.
1,Not again,"What a joke, This is the third release of the original series on standard definition DVD. How many times can they milk us??? For those of us Idiots that went out and Bought the HD version of the first season to now realease the second and one would assume third seasons just on standard without the high def is just adding Insult to Injury. WHY? As combos they still could play on either player? Not only will i not get this standard def set. at a ridiculous $63 i wont be buying in on Blu Ray either even though i have a player. The HD Version had picture in picture commentary on a few episodes along with a host of other features and whenever and HD is loaded with features if you check the Blu Ray versions its almost always just the movie or a cut down version of special features, why?? i thought blu ray held more and was better? Either way dont buy this. Im sure they will release this set on about 8 more formats in the next ten years in an effort to milk the public endlessly."
1,Not helpful,"I found this book too brief on both methodology, worked examples and samples problems. Recommend looking elsewhere for your GRE materials. This is the 2nd edition new for 2001, and, by the way, the first edition of the book (ISBN: 0028612612) is poorly rated as well. I guess it didn't get much work between editions. Found Cracking the GRE 2002 considerably better. Good luck!"
2,please be gentle,"I really enjoy the songs welcome to planet motherfu@#er, thunder kiss '65, black sunshine and soul crusher. The rest of the songs are ""filler"" they are boring and after soul crusher I turn the cd off. You also have to turn up the volume pretty loud because of bad production values. I do think that this cd will appeal to people who like thrash so give it a listen."
1,Erk.. not too good.,"I really didn't enjoy this album. The tracks are too long and boring. There's only one or two songs I like.The only other album I've heard is Astro Creep 2000, and that was a good album. But this one...... don't bother."
4,It's the Zomb!,"I guess we can credit Beavis and Butthead from saving this one from the great unknown. This album was such a great change from everything else at the time, and rocked you to death. A super combo of theatrics and metal. Plenty of good stuff on here, like ""Welcome To Planet MotherF*cker"", ""Black Sunshine"", and ""I Am Legend"". But without a doubt the highlight is ""Thunder Kiss '65"", possibly my favorite Zombie song ever. Their next album was equally great, and of course I would also suggest Rob's collection ""Past Present & Future"". Oh, and this sounds even better on glow-in-the-dark vinyl."
4,If you came here to mellow out...,"turn around and get the heck outta here! This CD will kick you in the booty so hard - and then you'll play it again! And actually, there's some interesting word-play sometimes here too (believe it or not!)"
5,used book and looks brand new!,"this is book is ""used"" but it is in perfect shape!! i love my results, i highly recommend!!!!!!"
3,OK,I'm a fan of hers and look forward to seeing her live some day.. but this mix is very light on vocals and at times is just kind of... there. This is quite different from her normal records and it caught me by surprise.
4,Another great Disc by Garret,I enjoy how Kenny can make all syles of music grove. Most on the composition on the disc are simple but complex. I think if Warner Brothers would have let the tunes be longer people would aprieciate the CD more.
4,An Ideal Pan For Anyone's Kitchen,This pan is very convenient with it non-stick feature and prevention of splattering. Now with this pan I am able to cook fried rice hassle free and meats and fish easily wihtout worrying that the hot oil may accidently splash or jump up. I recommend this pan to anyone is spends a lot of time in the kitchen for this pan is ideal for cooking any kind of food at all!
5,More Joe & Eddie!,"I was lucky enough to have my parents play me Joe & Eddie records--LPs--growing up...Now, I can listen to their wonderful voices and uplifting songs everywhere! If you like folk or gospel, this is the album for you."
3,Dated but decent,"This book is very much out of date HOWEVER, it is still interesting and much of this technology is still in use in some form or another. It covers the material decently and with sufficient depth for a working professional."
1,"No-budget indie garbage, don't bother","I'm glad I didn't pay much for this, but what I did pay, was not worth it. This is a poorly-made indie film, that is supposed to take place in the 80's, but that aspect is just as unconvincing as the rest of the film. The usual group of brainless teens go to the woods to get slaughtered by the usual stereotyped dude in a pig mask with a chainsaw. You've seen it before, and it's been done better. Don't bother."
5,amazing,"Robert Bradley's voice is so touching and incredible, it made me cry the first time I heard it. Every word he sings is so emotional. This album truly is the best one I own and I listen to it every day. Everytime I feel under the weather, I pop this into the cd player and just listen and sing along. If you like soulful blues, definetley check out this album."
2,NFS hasen't changed a bit!,"This video game is o.k., but it hasen't changed much!Like the some of the same cars, some of the same customization, some of the same street race action and some of the same police action!I wouldn't recommend this video game!"
1,Still not good!,"NFS hasn't changed at all. Even this game. The only changes to this game is a few new cars, and a new city.But still, I don't like the new version of NFS."
4,Great Game,"NFS: Carbon is a great game.The car movements are more realistic than more games because the weight of the car actually counts.The graphics are really good for a PS2 game.The great thing about any car game is that you can customize it.The cars in this game are somewhat limited in their customizing(the best car customizing game I've seen so far is Midnight Club 3 DUB Edition Remix)The best thing about this game is its level of realism.Everything seems insanely realistic, even the regular gameplay.Anyone want a great game, this is the one for you.Overall, 4/5"
5,Hank Snow Has Voice and Rhythm,"Hank Snow is great on this CD. He and his band found rhythm that will make you want to get up and dance with this CD. This is a ""Happy"" CD."
5,Bringing back memories,"Although I loved Hank Snow as a youth, I never had a lot of money to spend on records. But I have a good memory and this CD brings back in startling clarity those old songs that I remember from the 1950's. Only one song was new to me and the rest were the best from Hank's early, incredibly successful, US career. 20 songs for less than a dollar apiece; how could you go wrong?"
4,Wow,This is a super hot recount and re-enactment of gay first time stories. It's great to hear the narration by the openly gay Ian McKellen and the information provided is very helpful.
5,Cute little groundhog,This is a great little Beanie Baby. He arrived in good condition and I am enjoying him. He has been welcomed by all my other Beanie Babies.
2,Materials and craftsmanship,"I also owned a Spyderco knife about 5 years ago and was upset when I've lost it. I was really looking forward to receive the one that I've bought but was supprised to see that it had changed...the knife doesn't feel robust as it used tothe materials seems cheeper then it used toeven the sounds it does (clicks and clacks...) are not was they used to be.all in all I'm not very pleased with Spyderco's latest knife, would look for different brands next time"
2,Very disappointing!,"About 15 years ago, I received my first set of Circulon cookware and had no problems with it. In fact I loved it! I gave the set to a friend after about 8 years and as far as I know, the set is still great.However, I purchased a new set about 3 years ago, and I've had nothing but problems with them. Black spots have appeared on the bottom of the pots and will not come off. Everything sticks to both the pots and the pans and cleanup is a nightmare. I will be replacing the set soon, and will not be purchasing another set of circulon.From my experience, it seems that either I got a bad set on the second go round, or perhaps the quality has gone down. Either way, I will not be a returning customer."
3,NOT MUCH ON THIS CD THAT SOUNDS LIKE BLUEGRASS,"This group takes playing traditional bluegrass instruments to a higher level. Unbelivable talent! But, this is not a bluegrass album. Maybe newgrass with some polkas thrown in."
4,Beware - Different Versions Of This CD Exist,"The CD titled, ""The Very Best Of Slim Dusty"" comes in different versions with some songs missing on one version. This listing shows the 25 track version, which is great. But there is also a version with the exact same cover that has only 24 tracks. That version does NOT include the songs, ""Looking Forward Looking Back"" (track 1) or ""Waltzing Matilda"" (track 25) and adds the track, ""Wobbly Boot"" at the end. One version has less value to the collector and the Slim Dusty fan than the other, especially when two signature songs are missing from one edition. Unfortunately, the good folks who are selling this CD do not make a distinction in their listings as to which version they're selling. When you're spending $20 and higher for this CD, it's worth asking the seller before you buy which version is being offered so you aren't disappointed when you spend good money for a CD you thought contained the 2 missing songs."
5,All Powder Laundry Detergent,Smells Good.Works Great.Product Came in a Nice Crush Proof Box.Got it Even Cheaper Because I Set Up an Automatic Shipment For Every 6 Months.I Think Amazon Knocked Off Like Another 10% Off The Listed Price For Doing So.All in All a Great Buy.Do Not Hesitate to Buy.
4,Interesting and informative -- has stood the test of time!,"I'm only partway through this book, but I have to say that it's one of the best and most informative on the subject that I've come across. I found it basically by accident while browsing this site, recognized Bonewits' name from another site I'd visited, and decided to try out his book.He doesn't use a particularly religious context in his approach, and in a way I think this is a good thing. As a solitary Wiccan I'm always looking for good printed source material, and there just isn't much out there that doesn't devolve into happy fuzzies at some point. Bonewits' book is a breath of fresh air that I'm sure I'll be referring to time and time again.It's a little involved for beginners, but once you've got at least a passing familiarity with some of the topics he discusses (such as sympathetic magic, which I was doing for years before properly understanding what it was or even what it was called), you'll be well on your way."
3,Effective but rough,"We were looking for the wipes we used at the hospital, these are not it. We tried calling the hospital, as well, and they said their wipes are made specifically for them. Oh well, onward with the search. I will not be using these again - too rough."
4,Great shoe for both exercising & out and about,"I started using this brand back in the 80's when they were exclusively selling volleyball shoes, 20 yrs later they are still making them better than other. one of the lightest pair out there in the market, if you can get it below $40 it is the best bargain for your dollar. I had to bring it back to Canada where they are selling these for $100+taxes.Plus lots of color option as well."
3,Not too impressive,"Well, all these rave reviews don't seem to mention that most of us with a dvd player are not going to get a better image than a regular old cathode rayed tv. Reason? The picture at the video stores is run through hi-def cable so the image at home is always less comparable. When I hooked this baby up I was sad. My 10 year old Toshiba 36"" set looked just as good if not better. And don't even think of playing a vhs through it! Yikes!New technology just sucks in allot of ways. Sorry! So, unless you are running a blu-ray machine, I suggest waiting a few years till this piece of plastic antiquated technology comes down to around 200 bucks-which is what it is really worth, heck, what all of these sets are worth! Way over inflated for what you are paying for. Of course, by then, the 3D wave generators with plasma interface units will be on the market complete with sensory feedback. Ahhh, the future!"
5,I love it,"I just got it from CC for 1340. I am very happy with my new TV. It is big enough for our LR - I was planning to get 42"", glad did not. I highly recommend it."
4,Not As Great As His Second Album But A Good Start,"Can't deny that ""Que Te Vas"" became a worthy smash hit in the summer of 99' even on the weekend tropical slot at spanish pop ballad station in Houston. The song took me by surprise the first time I heard it when it picked up the tempo half way through the song on the piano solo. The rest of the album starts slowing down and fading away, but I took it as a sign for a better album next time, and it happened."
3,"Lots of fun, but not exactly my thing","This is my first experience with the Battlefield series. I chose 2142 because I'm more into sci-fi than conventional warfare. There is a bit of a learning curve to the game as there are a lot of features (weapons, equipment, vehicles, communications, squad play to name a few). But once you get a handle for the game it is a lot of fun. Titan mode is pure joy for me. Fighting in large scale team based battles is also a fresh change from standard deathmatch games as well.My primary complaint with the game is the ranking system; which admitedly is a matter of personal taste. The fact that you have to go up in rank to unlock equipment means that players who put in more hours get better equipment. As a casual gamer this means that players with less skill, but more time in the game, may have an advantage over me. And players with more time and experience in the game have a significant advantage over me. I guess it's up to you to decide whether that's good or bad."
4,Key wouldent work.,"Its that simple....too bad fifteen words are required to address this. Nine more words are required to click submit, ok."
1,"No Spyware, Still Ads","All of the reviews here are angry at EA, but for the wrong reason. EA is not capturing your browsing history or cookies. The only ""tracking technology"" admitted to is the fact that advertisers need to know that players actually saw an ad in-game. So, everyone has a right to be angry (and not buy the game), but do it for the right reasons. A modern-day ad looks very silly sitting next to a 40-foot futuristic war machine.This begs the big question, though. Why pay full price for a game that is subsidized by in-game advertisements?"
4,Great,"So... the only reason I don't give this five stars is the level of complexity detracts from the over-all fun of it. A simple game like Halo will still provide hours more entertainment at a LAN party for people of all skill levels. Whereas the BF series can be cumbersome.As far as the ""Spyware"" goes.... who cares? Google uses the same routines all day long to target advertisements and no one complains. The routine running behind this game only gathers data during map loads, which are long anyway. I'd rather have targeted ads than random ads for V1agr4 and P3n15 enlargement any day. Plus it adds to that futuristic feel of the game (has anyone seen Minority Report?). It's where things are going.... eat it."
4,"Very Good, Very Fun, but not Quite Blown Away........","Ok...I don't see why people are so livid about the adware. I guess some of the other reviewers are trying to start some kind of movement or something. Seriously...who cares! This game is definitely worth 50 bucks.Being an avid player of BF2, I was hoping that EA would come out with something revolutionary...while very good, this game is clearly a BF2 derivative. It's an incremental step up rather than something that's going to change the way we game (somebody needs to make a quantum leap forward, soon). I thought Ghost Recon would make that leap, but the excellent graphics in Advanced Warfighter are negated by the lack of vehicles, small maps, and generally poor game play.The vehicles rock, the weapons are interesting and widely varied, and the storyline and feel of the maps kick a*s. All in all, BF2142 is probably the best shooter out there right now."
4,Not all modes available offline...,"This game is great, but it lacks full play-ability right out of the box. The newest and best feature of the game, Titan Mode, isn't available for LAN play or even with singleplayer. Without Titan Mode, it becomes another first person shooter. Although, the ways in which you build your class of soldier up is a fresh challenge for gamers to specialize their skills through one class of soldier. Overall, I give this game a 4 because Titan Mode is locked out for LAN and singleplayer play."
1,Nothing but regrets...,"With the release of this title EA has gone from my overall favorite publisher to the only one I no longer support. Whether it's spyware/adware or not doesn't matter, the fact that there was no advance notice about it on the e-tailer sites, EA forums or the outside of the box did not allow me to make an informed purchasing decision. In game advertisement is obviously not a feature that EA was proud enough of to list on the box. I would have given the fun factor of the game four stars if I played it but since I don't it only deserves 1 star. Please send EA the message that we don't want IGA in our games by not buying this game."
3,DO NOT BUT USED BATTLEFIELD 2142,"I would like to tell you about whether this was a good game or not. But when I installed my copy of the game I got a message saying that my CD key was already linked to an account. I e-mailed the seller 3 days ago asking for his username and password, but I don't know if I'll get a response.When you first login to Battlefield 2142 EA links your username with your CD key, so no one else will be able to use your game. I don't know why they did that. If you buy a USED copy of Battlefield 2142 you will not be able to play it."
1,"I will not purchase adware, no matter how attractive","Not a chance. I was all into getting this game for my new XPS1710. Not now. EA, it'll be fun to watch you flail."
2,Its okay.,The game style is great but online play is limited because its so old. Honestly this pc game style is outdated but as a LAN party game with the TITAN game mode never gets boring!
3,A Re-hash of the BF2,"New clothing for the Emperor? A fresh coat of paint maybe? I had hoped for a better, more robust, playable game. What we have received is lightly warmed over hash. I will think twice before spending another outrageous amount for an EA game. Tell it to your friends, or let your enemies discover for themselves :)"
1,EA Downloader is a Ripoff. I'm stuck with this game!,I actually was able to play the game ONE DAY AFTER the physical release. Spyware? Horrible. Softdrink commercials on 2142???? Shame on EA and shame on this industry for these practices. Microsoft be advised that this program is requesting to delete a file that widely opens the OS kernel for hacking.
4,Unexpected pleasure in early Bear Stories,"...I figured that Amazon had made a slight goof, for how could a17 year old hardcopy version of the book still be in print when thepaperback is out of stock? So I decided to order it anyway.Imagine my surprise when I received notice when it shipped and it arrived.This collects several early Bear Stories, including the title story (which serves as a prequel to the Eon stories), The White Horse Child (a rare fantasy entry), Hardfought (1983 Nebula winner), Petra (a Nebula Nominee), Scattershot and Mandala (part of his novel Heaven's River).It's a strong ""first stories"" collection, and if you can grab it and are a fan of Greg Bear, then you should certainly do so."
1,Too difficult for the age range of kids who like Shrek,"I installed this game and thought I'd check it out for myself before the kids saw it. It was difficult to maneuver the character and I was also pretty disappointed with the grapics, especially considering the amount of resource you need to run it in the first place. My PC was specifically built for gaming, so it's no slug when it comes to games. I play Sims 2 with ALL the expansion packs, plus thousands of downloaded items and NEVER have the lag I had on this game. When the kids (age 9) played it, they weren't impressed either. They said it was too hard to figure out the controls and basically tired of trying to figure it out very quickly."
3,Not what I really expected however.....,"as we all know maxis and EA are just making newer versions of the sims one expansion packs for the sims 2. if anyone didnt hear about the 2 new expansions coming up, hollywood (superstar) and bon voyage (vacation that sortve proves it. as far as pets goes it wasnt as bad as everyone said it was. the pets idea as always is inovative but i find 2 out of 5 times the pets end up getting in the way. for one you cant control the pets like in sims 1 which just ruins the purpose of the game. the idea of a blue dog was pretty cool though :) the item add ons are terrible i expected so much more. its a neat expansion but it was rushed and its sloppy. theres also alot of breeds missing pet wise.the ups.playing fetch with my blue beagle.having animals like parrots.the downs.bad itemstoo few breedspathing issues.3/5 rating"
1,Annoying!,"Pets are cute at first. Kittens and puppies eventually grow into cats and dogs. However, the pets are annoying and scratch up your furniture. You can buy a bird cage, but if you don't feed it, the bird eventually dies. Dogs and cats can be bred and have litters, but they take three Sim days to do so (if there's a hack to speed that up, I couldn't find it). Dogs and cats come out at night and dig up holes in your front lawn and scare off other pets. Adds a lot of modern furniture.Not worth it! My Sims could of lived perfectly fine without pets. After you install this expansion, they only want to buy and train pets. I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
4,Sims 2 Pets,"Not the best expansion pack released for The Sims 2, but definately a good one. The best feature of this ep? Diagonal roofs!"
4,It is far better that nintendo dogs of DS,"I like to train the dogs, seems very well to me that trainers exist in case I do not know to train the dog. It enchants to me that the dog finds a job and brings money to house. On the other hand, the face of the dogs does not have much face expression and they are generally ugly of face."
4,I got the Figuere alien without a foot,"The McFarlante 12 inch action figure Alien collectible is a great item and I got it a present for a relative that loves the Alien series, so I was really excited to purchuse it. I ordered the figure form Mr-Magazine store and in the description of the product the seller stated that it was in good conditions. I just received the Alien today and was very dissapointed when I opened the box it was shipped in to find out that the figure was missing the right foot! This does not qualify as ""good condition"" and when I looked for this product there was no specification of this and the picture of the product showed the Alien on its base with both feet. Really dissapointed as I wanted this to be a great gift. Be careful with what you buy and find out what ""good"" condition really means to the seller so you don't get a bad surprise like me."
2,Needs severe editing,"This reviewer could not see past the awful editing job done on the book. It reads like someone ran a spell checker and that was it--words used out of context, in the wrong tense, pepper it."
3,The same Book as Spanish Now!,"This book is essentially the same book sold as ""Spanish Now! Book 1"". It has the same stories and exercises. I bought both books thinking I would have two study resources. I was dismayed to find nearly identical content! Save your money and buy Spanish Now! Book instead."
4,Spanish the Easy Way,Trying to refresh my Spanish and found this book useful particularly because it has answers to the exercises so that you will know if you are going the right way. Has a lot of basic information that other manuals of this type don't include.Recommended by instructor in refresher course who is a college level instructor in Spanish.
5,Spanish the Easy Way,"The book came in just 3 or 4 days. Even tho' it was listed as used, it was in new-book condition. I don't believe it had ever been used. Spanish the Easy Way is easy to use on your own, or as a supplement to a class."
1,stinky feet!,"I wish I had seen the reviews about the smell before I bought! It smells like the worst stinky feet I have ever smelled in my life. The taste is pretty awful, too. I tried a few things to make it better (honey, lemon, I forget what else) and I still could barely get it down. I did drink a large cup, though, but it did not help me sleep at all. If anything I had a harder time sleeping that usual, but that was probably coincidence. I'll be throwing this out! If I could give it no stars I would."
4,It is better than I expected,I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected. Also it smells and taste better than I expected!
4,Nice!,packaging was good & received the prod on time! may order few more! its good who knows the benefit of it!
4,Does the job,I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling. The only thing I don't like is that on the shelf it smells like vomit. It grosses me out. It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.
5,Sugar Buster,"We use it at night to lower diabetes sugar and it works. My husband has been able first to reduce the medications and now has been off for 2 months. Of course this is together with exercise, weight reduction and proper nutrition."
2,Personal preference,I had hoped this tea would taste better but it just tastes to me like I steeped weeds from the backyard.
1,Terrible Tasting,I have been a tea drinker for many years and this has to be the worst tasting tea I have ever had.
4,"Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good","I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!"
2,Nasty tea debris everywhere!,"When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!"
3,Good Tea,"Tea is a good value for the price. Was hard to find any where else. I like this brand of tea, also."
5,Her best since Pretenders II,"Chrissie is back! Well Last days of Independents was pretty good but this one istrully amazing. Her voice is magical. Every song is great. I especialy like the song in portuguese. Now I understand the function of the ""repeat"" on my CD player."
2,"If you want to be depressed, it's a great read","The book started off great, but quickly turned into Schwab's launching pad for his beliefs. Schwab basically blamed the U.S. for everything going on in Africa and made it the sole responsibility of the U.S. to fix it. The book seemed more to me like a laundry list of problems and Schwab's personal panacea for Africa. He's a wonderful journalist. He should stick to that."
1,Apparently shoved out to market half-finished.,"Very glitchy -- crashes even with patch available online. Lot's of options that appears to be meaningless to game play -- hard to say for sure. User interface is difficult, which is too bad, since I was hoping my little boys would enjoy this. I finally trudged through the bad UI, the lack of instructions, etc, and finished a ""project"", only to be given no score, no congratulations, no acknowledgment that the goals were successfully completed. I think the developers (Bold Games) ran out of money, and just pushed the product out the door."
3,Fun toy but wastes batteries,"My 4 1/2 hr old daughter received this toy for Easter and she loves it. The slide does fall apart easily, but she doesn't mind. My problem with it is that after playing with it, the toy will turn on by itself and waste the batteries. I will turn it off, and 2 minutes later its back on again. In order to stop the madness, I have to remove the batteries. Thats a hassle to do after each time she plays with it - especially if its a couple of times a day. She loves playing with it though!"
4,Good little storage container,Very convenient little storage container for those unlimited numbers of plastic bags that seem to repopulate like rabbits-easy to install and pretty sturdy.
4,An Apartment Dwelling Cooks Viewpoint,"I find this Stir Fry very useful. It is big enough to do stir- fry for a couple of people and small enough to still fit in my apartment. It has the quality of my other Analon pans, I especiall like the added disk on the bottom. This not only keeps the pan flat on the burner but conducts heat so evenly that you don't have to use high heat settings to do your stir-fry. Because of the pans shape and construction it also doubles as a large sauce pan, I have even used it to brown up to 4 lbs of ground beef. When I purchased this pan the deciding factor was that it had a lid, it makes the pan a lot more versatile. The lid even fits Analon's 12 inch Griddle pan"
3,It is not that good,"well, for the first several months it was prefect, but after that, I could see tiny scratches (I promise I was extremely careful) and it began stick. I am really disappoint."
3,The Grandpa of period instrument ensembles: a version for those who think they hate Beethoven played on period-instruments,"See my review on the disc's other entry:Beethoven: Symphony No. 3 in E Flat, Op. 55 (""Eroica"")"
5,soul mover rocks!,"SINCE THE DAY I HEARD BURN BY DEEP PURPLE I'VE BEENA FAN OF GLENN HUGHES. IT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITEALBUMS AND EVERY ROCK FAN SHOULD GET IT.

SOALL YOU REAL ROCK FANS THAT THINK MUSIC IS DEAD THINK AGAINAND BUY THIS NOW! I'D GIVE 10 STARS IF I COULD! ROCK ON!BONUS: VIDEO FOR SOUL MOVER INCLUDED IS AWESOME!"
3,Hard but fun??,"I really don't know what to say except that even though it seems extremely hard for my sons to beat and get through to the next level, they keep playing it. You can hear my little one screaming at the tv ""That's not fair, he cheated!"" on the other side of the house. I keep asking him why he wants to play a game he seems to dislike so much, but he never answers and keeps at it. He's 6, but my 9 year old isn't able to help him either. I think I'm going to have to buy a new game just to get him to stop playing it and give us some peace!"
3,replacement temperature station,This station is a replacement for one I've had for a little over 1 year. The station is great except that the parts don't last too long. I had the transmitter stop functioning after 8 months (covered by warranty) and the receiver stopped functioning after 13 months (not covered by warranty). I've been disappointed by the endurance of the product but happy with the product itself.
3,Good but limited use threshold.,"The product can only be used where the threshold and door frame are square and the space under the door is the same height from side to side. If the space between the door and threshold varies from side to side, the threshold product cannot be adjusted to compensate."
4,"Oil Gauge works great, gauge needle does not glow at night.","This gauge works fine, it is just hard to read it at night. The gauge indicator needle does not light up when you turn your lights on. But for the price can't complain."
3,"Very nice aroma, but..............","Bought for my wife as she loves the smell of plumeria. Smells very nice, but it does not hold. After half of an hour, forget it! Maybe it varies from person to person."
4,Great Read.,"I find The Romance of Tristan and Iseult a good read for anyone interested in Medieval literature, or romance; or both for that matter. It's well ahead of its time in that it is a story of two lovers forced apart by circumstance and whose love affects others around them as well as themselves, centuries before Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. There is only one downside I can see, though. It is the lack of description of battles in the story; the author doesn't tell much about the fights or what happens in them, only that they occured. But all in all an endearing story."
3,C'est un bon livre de poche,C'est bien comme livre mais je cherche plutot de l'information sur Joseph Bedier!!!
5,Great Mystery,You can't go wrong ordering these. Each one is unique and will keep you hooked and guessing to the end. Wonderful.
1,Painful to see how far they've fallen,"I have loved this series but no more! It has turned into a farce! If you are looking for this kind of entertainment, buy the new Miss Marple, or the more refined Inspector Lewis.Please don't waste your money as I have."
5,update fs 2004 & FSX,"this power pack updates flight sim 2004 and FSX and adds some great aircraft like B-17, B-24, B-29, as well as me 410,ar-234, he-162 and adds them to combat flight simulator 3 as well so you can use them in combat as well A MUST HAVE"
4,the album to get,Charley pride is one of countries most uniques stars in that he is known for love songs. kiss an angel good morning for example. If you do not have a charley pride album this is the one for you! If you do then this one will just add to your collection of great albums.
2,You can do better yourself,"This is an okay book for the average fan of the show but for anyone else, the pages of this book would make good rabbit cage paper or fireplace kindling.It's poorly written, badly organized, has way too much fluff (269 pages total and over half is centered on people behind the scenes or episode guides).As I have said in the opening, you can do better writing this yourself (and I have). Nothing in it is new to the a fan of the show.On the flip side, the content is good...but poorly handled."
4,Brooding gothic romance,"Lee Karr is a wonderful gothic romance author, and this is a fine example of her work. The elements were all familiar, yet all just right, as the heroine becomes headmistress of an old girls' school and grapples with true-to-life concepts: her age, her appearance, her loveability, in addition to mysterious threats and danger. The hero Clinton is sympathetic and likeable. Their chemistry together is most exciting. Don't miss any book by Leona/Lee Karr."
1,Horrible product,Please don't buy this. I gave it to my dog last night and had to rush him to the vet this morning because he couldn't walk and was shaking so bad. They said it was because of this and they have to keep him all day to monitor him. This product shouldn't even be sold. Please don't buy!
4,Worth a read!!!,"I read this book in two days!!! Now i agree that Ms. Furlong seems , at times, to not be such a fan of St. Therese. I do think she examines her life in against the heavy handed French Catholicism of the 19th Century well!!! The author is a very good writer , I was sad to learn she died of cancer in 2003!! I came away with renewed admiration for St. Therese after reading this book and that is what this biography will do for you as well!! As an addendum, I will definitely read Ms. Furlong's biography of Thomas Merton which appears to have many more favorable reviews from Amazon readers!!"
4,How Money Can Change the People Around You,"A teenage girl wins a large sum of money in a contest and finds the attitudes of her friends and family change. Gritty, raw, and an introspective view of how poverty and money leaves a person in more disparity and yet finds a will to survive."
2,try to teach yourself buddhism,"Not bad but they spent way too much time on western Buddhism. I was trying to learn more about Buddhism but hearing about Buddhists in England doesn't really teach you much. If anyone knows of a Buddhist book that talks about the religion and how it is practiced in Southeast Asia (not North America), please recommend."
3,nonstick coating lasted about a year,"Despite practicing all of the following:hand washed with soft spongenever heated to high tempallowed to cool down before washingusing only soft spatulas,the non-stick coating of this pan began to deteriorate after about 1 year of use (used about 5 days/week, making pancakes and/or sausage and eggs for breakfast."
5,Exactly What I Needed,"It seems like finding a shovel to collect ash from your fireplace and a bucket to put it in shouldn't be difficult, but it is. I'm probably paranoid, but I didn't want any cheap ash bucket - I wanted one that was very sturdy, wouldn't easily tip over, had a tight fitting lid, and a good quality shovel that wouldn't fall apart after one season of use. This fits the bill perfectly! Even if I cleaned the fireplace out the morning after a fire, when some of the coals could still have some heat, I would be confident using this bucket - it's great for its purpose."
2,Very Average,this disc is very average.as much as i Respect her great talent&range this disc just left me cold for the most part.for instance Gotta Serve Somebody the Classic song by Bob Dylan never gets off the ground here just like much of this disc.what a waste.
1,What was she thinking?,"I'm a huge fan of Ms.Cole's, and when I first heard the single ""Snowfall on the Sahara"" (glorious!) I couldn't wait to get to the store to pick up this CD. What a MESS! There is no concept to this crazy quilt collection. ""A Song For You"" is way off target with it's soul-style embellishments, ""Corinna"" is one the the most god-awful and insipid songs ever, and for some strange reason the lady feels she has to say something cute before actually singing many of the numbers. I have nothing against Natalie singing contemporary material (""Everlasting"" is one of my favorites) but next time out she should choose ONE good producer, some songs that are worthy of her, and just SING them!"
4,Great voice,Music tastes are very personal. I love NC's voice and the mix of songs on this cd. I particularly love the cover of the Bob Dylan song.
2,Hard read!,"If you thought this would be a fun read: get a dictionary, cup of coffee, and pen! I felt like I was in college again picking this up. I haven't gotten far and it's just made a cozy place in my bookshelf. Maybe I'll try again when I'm not holding a newborn and sleep deprived! I heard it was an amazing read though-I only grabbed it since it was recommended."
3,Didn't Offer Solutions,"Although this book was great at describing the problems of love, it didn't offer many solutions about how people can help themselves. I found the book to be depressing and discouraging through it's lack of solutions; it only pointed out the problems other reviewers have pointed out. Overall, it's good for information about why we love, but lacks in any real information about how to change ourselves for the better. I recommend readingAttached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help YouFind?and Keep?Love, it describes the different attachment styles and offers a more comforting take on human attraction/love with great thought provoking solutions."
5,A General Theory of Love,This book has helped me clarify my understanding of how people learn. I am about to start my second reading. I wish I could have read this book forty years ago.
1,waste of time.,This is an awful butchering of the wonderful characters Jane Austen portrayed. This does not even deserve one star. It angered me how she killed off all of the characters.
3,"if you liked Yoshimi, read this","I was disappointed by the CD in spite of the obvious talent of the band. The songs have a sentimental and sincere emotionality that is jarringly different than Yoshimi, which has a positively weird and ironic energy to it. I listen to Yoshimi a lot, but Soft Bulletin can sound like Billy Joel if don't listen too hard. And that is a very bad thing."
4,Prog rock out of time,"The previous reviewer's comparisons with Yes are exactly in synch with my own reaction, although there are more eras than The Yes Album reflected in this music - in many respects, this is a record Yes could have made last week, especially with the orchestral textures! Curiously, I bought this CD on the back of its indie credentials, so I was staggered to find it peddling an unashamedly ""prog"" brand of rock, in a concept album, no less. Not a damning indictment, at least for me, but ironic that praise has been lavished upon this work from quarters that would get out the garlic and stake at the mere suggestion of ""progressive"". Many interesting moments, then, although not a classic, because of the all-too-frequent passages that sound like a bad Rick Wakeman solo album from the 70s. The vocals would have been beautiful if sung by Jon Anderson, but the roughness eventually jarrs. So what about a Yes/Flaming Lips collaboration, then?"
3,Why change a masterpiece?,"Ok, so some people will think I'm nuts, but I am truly upset with this release. When the Soft Bulletin finally came out on vinyl a few years ago, they used alternate takes, different mixes and the track order was a little different. I was so excited to see this was finally coming back out on vinyl, because I thought it would finally be redone just like the CD, however, this just seems to be a repressing of that original vinyl, which still has the different takes and one song not on the CD, ""Slow Motion"". There is also a CD with 3 bonus songs. While I think there would certainly be interest in an alternate release of demos, outtakes, etc. from the sessions for this record, am I the only one who wishes they would release the album just as it came out on CD? It's such a great record, and I would just enjoy hearing it (on vinyl) the way I remember the CD."
5,MY LIPS ARE ON FIRE,"I was in Cellophane Square one day and suddenly I heard this song. It was Waitin' for Superman, and I realized that if I didn't own this album, my life would be missing something beautiful. And so my prophecy came true, because this album has some of the most beautiful rock music I've ever heard since Roger Water's Amused to Death. The Flaming Lip's Soft Bulletin is an undisputable work of art that deserves a listen. BUY IT!"
5,The Future of Music!,"The Flaming Lips have made a time machine of an album. They have blasted into the future, us as their baggage, to see what rock is goin' be like in 20 or so years. If you like music upon music upon music, this is the record for you. A true classic! It literally made the hairs on my arms stand on end. Easily the best album of '99!"
4,A quantum leap in mid-career.,"I've been a R&R fan, and an avid album/cd collector, for more than 30 years. The most exciting experience for a fan is to find an awesome first album: Sex Pistols, Suede, Oasis, Stone Roses, The Smiths. The second-best experience is to witness a good band turn great: Nirvana, The Verve, Smashing Pumpkins...and The Flaming Lips. There were virtues aplenty on ""Cloud Taste Metallic"" and ""Satellite Heart""--but those virtues have been amplified and magnified on ""The Soft Bulletin."" In fact, there's a quantum leap in melodicism, lyricism, and plain old musical confidence on their latest work. Now, I guess I have to go out and get 3 more CD players so I can scope out the quadrophonic ""Zaireeka."" Oh well, if ""Soft Bulletin"" is any indication, it'll be money well spent."
4,TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC MINDS,"A bonding of the cosmic and the mundane in a musical fantasy soundscape where your common splattered bug on the windshield flies in direct from Fairyland, Superman is nearly defeated, scientists compete to find a cure to save mankind from itself, and there is laundry to be done. All to the tune of some catchy quirky melodies. The very pretty orchestration with quivering falsetto vocal is offset by a hippie, druggie whimsey, ferocious drumming and splashes of rock guitar to keep this sensual passion play from becoming just too precious. The song, ""Waiting For A Superman"" is more psychologically earthward, mooning quite effectively strength gained in the loss of childhood beliefs. Certainly an odd and beautiful album."
2,Cool little trick,"Hey- Many of you might already know this, but if you play this album's ""Race for the prize"" at the same time as the segment of 2001: A Space Odyssey titled ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinate,"" you'll see that it is a perfect match. The song was designed that way, so that the two are in synch. Many people know about the Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz connection, but perhaps you haven't heard of this one. Check it out, it works!"
1,Just barely...,"After all the rave reviews, I couldn't hardly wait to peel off the plastic wrapper and get this disc on my player. But, within a matter of minutes, I was transported back to the wonderful land of OZ, listening to the Tin Man lament his lack of a brain. If you thought this was the best of the 90s, you need to remove the ear wax which has been building up over the past ten years. Someone once said that the reason rap-rock is so popular is because the ""singers"" don't have to worry too much about carrying a tune. Listening to this, the same could be said about the Lips' approach to alt-rock."
2,A modern masterpiece?,"I bought this album after reading how great it was by the people who supposedly know about such things: music critics. Upon listening to it for the first time I was a little disappointed, but thought it might grow. It did grow as well, more and more irritating with each listen. Don't get me wrong, there's a few catchy songs here, the best of which is A Spoonful Weighs a Ton, but the plastic production, nerdish lyrics and annoying effects, particularly when the rhythmic intro to one track is sung by a band member, really grate. The whole thing sounds somewhat soulless and cosmetic, but perhaps that's the point. It's not particularly original either, as many critics would have you believe, but more a high-tech 70's prog album. If you want to see how this sort of thing can be done with feeling then buy the Pretty Things album Parachute instead, you won't be disappointed."
2,Sound quality is poor,"I own a vintage tube amplifier with a mullard driven pre-amp. I love listening to records through it.However this album did not pass grade. Dont get me wrong, I love this album but this pressing must have been poor.It sounds much better on CD than on this cut. Extremely trebbly and too much bass. Almost sounds like tin.It may be WB mastering though. I dont think they changed the mix for vinyl from CD."
2,What masterpiece are you talking about?,"Reading your very good reviews, I ran to buy THE SOFT BULLETIN. How disappointing it was! I'd save only 2-3 tracks out of it. Boring, full of honeyed orchestration, only a rough and ugly copy of the YES, a mithycal group of the seventies. What does THE SOFT BULLETIN have to do with rock?Wilco, Coldplay, Sparklehorse, Counting Crows, Porcupine tree, Beck, Smashing Pumpkins, even Train and Travis are very far better than this useless Flaming Lips.I know that all is subjective but before talking about ""masterpieces"", ""album of the year"" etc. one should think twice."
1,No rock on this set of Lips......,"Like the rest of the sheep, I couldn't wait to get my ears on this when it first came out--then I couldn't wait to sell this back!!WHERE'S THE ROCK?---ain't no Lips I'm used to kissin', that's fer sure!!--I mean I gave it a try more than once, in different moods & everything!, still NOTHING!--The title says it all!!!!!"
5,Ahead of their time,"The Flaming Lips paint lush textures with keyboards, strings, guitars and sound effects. While some artists fail at this, the Flaming Lips take big chances, risking failure at every turn, and succeed. ""Feeling Yourself Disintegrate"" and ""Waiting for a Superman"" have to be two of the lovliest songs of the year. Wayne Coyne's quivery, often off-key voice somehow fits their music like a glove. Grand arrangements and big, thick vocal harmonies find their place on this album too, with bombastic drum sounds and slinky bass all intermingling together. This is music for the thinking person, but I can see how someone could hate this music. Give it a shot and see what you can hear in this album. Better yet, get yourself a good pair of headphones and listen...you'll be transported."
5,"A Triumphant, Timeless Classic","That's right, the Flaming Lips have made a classic, but who ever thought they could make an album like THIS? The Soft Bulletin is a tsunami, absolutely overwhelming in impact, yet it is also a deeply personal, touching, even spiritual record. Sure, this sounds extravagant, but these words don't come close to doing it justice. The beauty of the album simply beggars description, so just listen to it: the sound they make is love..."
5,Great Album!,"I like this album, especially the song called ""The Blessings"", in which a man sings about how he is blessed to have a wonderful family and a generally wonderful life.I operate an online radio station on live365.com that is temporarily playing Christmas music and have added this to the playlist (www.live365.com/stations/allenkep67)."
5,Neglected folk writer/singer,"I first bought ""Lord Offaly"" in the early 70s and was enraptured by Mcwilliams' voice and intriguing ballads. He was unfortunately producing ""soft"" folk ballads at a time when they weren't too popular, and so never achieved the recognition he deserved. He died when ony in his 50s. This album contains all of the hard-to-find Lord Offaly tracks plus a lot more. If you lke Irish/British folk with a good voice. try this one."
2,Disappointing,"Although I agree with the author that the idea of the immortal soul is of pagan Greek origin and not a Biblical truth - whereas the resurrection is - the arguments have been poorly constructed. This little booklet is simply not convincing and lacks Biblical support. It is largely philosophical in nature and therefore rather disappointing. If I knew upfront that it was only 60 pages, ie. 20 minutes worth of cursive reading, I certainly would not have ordered it. I believe the blurb on the booklet is misleading. I would not recommend it to serious readers of any persuasion."
2,weather channel station,"I purchased this item after seeing it at my sister's. She loved it, it was accurate and lasted a long time. The one I bought was more expensive than hers, it only worked for about 2-3 months and then stopped working. Maybe I just got a dud!"
5,"Good reinforcement and fun, too","My Granddaughters love the book. It follows the video and they are always picking up the book and signing with each page.Sometimes they bring it to me and sometimes they just enjoy it by themselves. I can tell which book they are enjoying, without seeing the book. They are quietly signing with each page. My Grandchildren are not hearing impaired, they just enjoy it."
5,Making a Name for the Massachusetts Scene,"Following the lead of GODSMACK and STAIND, REVEILLE are making a name for the Massachusetts music scene. These Chelmsford guys are about to go big time! They produce AMAZING energy in their live show (Drew's vox remind me a lot of Zack De La Rocha of RATM)and this CD is phenomenal. Recorded at legendary Long View Farm studios, w/ the aid of producer Steve Thompson (Korn, Metallica), the CD is flawless from start to finish! If you like hardcore/rap/metal/crossover, pick this one up -- cause it's goin platinum! Also- If you're in the New England area-or wherever you are- be sure to SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SCENE!!! Good luck fellas!"
4,Awesome Sounds and Yells,This CD is great - I just picked it up several weeks ago. They are similar to RATM but somewhat different. They have more of a two-ton sound as if they farted up a tree storm and blew chunks of riffs like water through a bagel. Buy it if you want to - it sounds of gold my friends.
1,don't be fooled,"The product its self is fine, but the ad is misleading as it SAY'S you get 180 caps. for the advertized price ,but they only send you 90 caps.& say that's all you paid for ."
2,Not a fan,I have liked maybe one or two of the recipes in here. Most of the recipes seem to equate healthy with high fiber. The informational facts are helpful. None of the recipes have created memorable dishes.
2,Lots of uses for chicpeas and converted measurement recipes,"I was very excited to receive this book so quickly. Now I am sorry I bought the book. Immediately I noticed converted recipes and I see why other reviewers considered the ingredients uncommon. I like European food and actually lived in Europee six years, long enough to know the ingredients are package differently and the measurements are in metrics. There are Scottish recipes that lead me to believe the author is Scottish. I can see the recipes will not be widely appealing to American taste and use ingredients that while available are not common in USA. I am also fond of chicpeas and in fact have cans in my cupboard but there is a heavy use of chicpeas in recipes that I don't like. Check this book out at a library if your can before committing."
5,book cover,"I just bought another slow cooker, when I receive it I will definitely use it, my son is a health nut, I know the book is going to good use!!!!! thanks amazon"
3,Not the best for me...,"The unfortunate thing about this cookbook is that one of the author's goals is to reduce animal protein. There are very few recipes with any sort of meat in them other then fish. When the recipes do call for chicken its always drumsticks - never a low calorie protein.The cookbook is great if you are looking for a wide variety of non-meat dishes, but this just isn't what I was looking for. I ended up returning this cookbook."
2,Not for regular use.,"Sadly, I have to agree with the reviews that say the recipes are overcomplicated and not for daily-type use. I was highly disappointed by this cookbook. Many of the recipes require a ridiculous amount of prep and effort (toasting seeds in a pan and grinding them with a mortar and pestle -- talk about completely missing the point of a slow cooker!) Quite a few use hard-to-find or specialty ingredients that can leave you scouring all the stores in town to find what you need and then paying an arm and a leg for it. No thanks. I'll be checking out some other slow cooker cookbooks."
3,totally sweet,"if you like totally sweet c.d.s then this is the one for you. it has songs, a case, and a bunch of sweet robot features. it has a mustache too."

5,How did I ever live without this?,"This pan has become my favorite pan. It heats evenly, it's easy to clean and it is very versatile. It requires only a misting of oil, so stir fries become a quick and healthy meal. I love it. I don't know how I ever lived without it!"
3,swivels around,"Nice heavy pan that heats well and has a great inside surface/shape for stir frying to your heart's content.Two obvious misgivings about it: it is HEAVY and cast iron (duh), so you need enough space to wash it in the sink, and it can leave black marks on an enamelled sink. It's also hard to tip and dump contents out neatly.Mine also spins around when I stir-fry, on a glass-top (induction) cooktop. It has a flat bottom but it seems slightly not flat. It doesn't wobble, really, just spins, which is surprising considering the weight of the pan. I know, duh, hold on to it. But if you are stir frying noodles with lots of stuff, it works better to do it with two hands, and then the wok goes round and round!"
5,"Wok, Wok, Wahh","Large n' Heavy, so, no stray edibles over the edge..Easy to clean, no stick when seasoned..Lifetime durability..Heats quickly and efficiently on an induction top stove/hotplate..I like you, long time.."
5,Use twice per week,"I make fried rice for breakfast twice per week using coconut oil and brown rice. The cooked rice should be a day old and dry. This wok sits on my smaller electric burner on high heat and it does a great job of getting hot and staying hot. It sears the food and gives the tamari a wonderful aroma. I'm sure it would be great for stir fry, etc., but I tend to eat my veggies raw so I don't know anything about stir fry. Recommended if you have the space to keep it."
5,Cast Iron Wok,"The Wok is fantastic. It is a quality LODGE piece of cookware. Although it is heavy, the piece is larger though lighter than I expected. Like other cast iron, it heats evenly. There is a flat area on the bottom that keeps it from tipping when you stir inside the rim. You do not need to purchase a Wok Stand that will be advertised with this item (for around $2). It is not needed. The servie of this vendor was exceptional. I had the item in less than 1 week, and it qualified for super saver shipping! Happy Cooking!"
5,What can I say?,"It's a cast iron wok. Uh, what did you expect? A super auto-cooker with extra features? It seasons well, it washes easily if you need/want to wash with mild soap and water. It's everything it *should* be. The food tastes great. I couldn't really ask for more. Oh, fair warning, it's not as light as its aluminium counter-parts. However, please...please...please follow their seasoning instructions and read the care manual. It's short, and will save you headaches if you've never owned cast iron cookware before."
3,Good wok,"Good, solid wok made from a company that is made in a country that effectively guarantees that your wok isn't constructed of material that contains metal impurities that might poison or kill you over time.That being said, I was looking for a wok that would give my food that Chinese wok-cooked flavoring that makes Chinese cooking so tasty. This wok does not do that, unfortunately. I don't know the chemical reasons behind this, but I do know I had one of those possibly-might-kill-you woks from Chinatown a few years ago and it did impart those awesome flavors, but I threw that wok out for obvious reasons.Now I'm on the search for a wok made by a company I can trust to not-kill-me, but can impart those flavors. If anyone knows one, I would welcome the advice."
2,Too Heavy!!!,I used to cook Chinese food professionally and I used a light weight wok. This wok is way to heavy. You can't flip or move the food easily--unless you have wrists of steel. If you are doing basic stir fry cooking this wok is not for you. If you are a beginner to wok cooking--stay away!
5,Almost perfect,"I wasn't sure which wok to buy for a cook from China, but this turned out to be the right choice. It's big, it heats up well, it's mostly non-stick and cleans up nicely.Cast iron isn't for everyone. It is heavy and requires a bit of care, but if you like cast iron, this is a great wok. Also, it is just the wok--no lid, no accessories.This is good if you will use it often, probably not the best choice if you just need a wok a few times a year. It is big and requires a lot of place to store."
5,DVD,"My Grands kids Loved all Three of these DVD's. I will buy more because I never get to see them, but at least the Kids Love them."
5,Why this movie is great,"This movie was the first Fievel movie I ever saw. I have to say, I like it much more than the original. The songs are awsome and the story was great. Come on. Who doesn't find a cat acting like a dog funny?"
3,BEWARE ....,BEWARE! THIS IS THE SAME AS 'KING BISQUIT FLOWER HOUR' UNDER A DIFFERENT TITLE. NOT HIS BEST EFFORT BUT INTERESTING. IT IS NOT ALL HIS MATERIAL. YOU'D BE BETTER OFF GETTING 'LEFT FOR LIVE' OR THE DELUXE VERSION OF THE SAME TITLE. BETTER STILL GET HIS FIRST TWO CDS AND 'TOO LATE THE HERO'.
5,Excellent skillet,"My mother-in-law had given me two Circulon pans which I really loved so when I saw an excellent price of the 12-inch skillet, I had to have it. I love this pan for sauteing veggies. The size gives you a lot of surface area so that you're actually sauteing and not just steaming the vegetables due to them getting stacked in too high. The pan heats evenly and clean up is easy. Very sturdy and great quality. I've been using this pan for over half a year and it's as good as new."
1,Worst customer service ever!,I sent this pan back to Meyer because of flaking after taking extra care of it. Circulon offers a lifetime warranty so I figured why not. Well the Meyer corporation proceeded to lose my original skillet. Then refuse to even speak to me about replacing it. After waiting for an hour on hold the rude CSR simply said too bad and hung up on me. This is without a doubt the worst customer service I've ever seen.
2,"12"" French Skillet Disappointment","My wife and I bought several open stock Circulon pans as we read reviews that were favorable. At first we really liked this pan, however after a few month's use, we began to notice that it was becoming very difficult to clean. The high-low cooking area was no longer very non-stick and the ""lows"" or grooves were very difficult to get clean. We tried brushes and scouring pads but the longer we used this pan, the more difficult it was to clean. We spent nearly $100.00 on this pan, but we rarely use it any longer because it has become so difficult to clean. For light use I suppose it would be a good pan, but don't use it every day."
2,Circulon skillets,"We bought a whole range. Both skillets now are full of stuck on food, despite lavish attention to cleaning and the purchase of the official Circulon bristley cleaner. A total rip off by the way, save some bucks and get a nail brush if you do buy the pans.One skillet was replaced under the lifetime warranty plan, but only after a bit of whining by the sales rep., who said we were not cleaning it properly. saucepans are fine as they only encounter food being boiled really. Add some oil and fry stuff, and forget it. My advice: money spent better elsewhere."
3,disappointed,I like the weight and looks of the pans but much to my disappointment after a couple of years use the ridges accumulated food that I could not get out without ruining the surface. Now the food sticks terribly and I really can't use the fry pans.
3,Great Pan but Disappointed,"This was my first Circulon pan and I purchased it in December 2002. The pan is great, totally non-stick and easy to clean. However, last week a big chunk of the handle broke making it unusable. I just got off the phone with the Mayer company and they will replace it only if I pay to ship it to them. I appreciate the replacement; but after only four months I don't feel that I should pay shipping."
4,"Amazing game, but with a few glitches","I LOVE this game!!! I believe Primal is unlike any other game I have ever played. An avid fan of survival horror/adventure games, to me this game gets almost 5 stars...and that's only because I experienced a couple glitches. I must admit one of them in the third realm had me stuck for months, and I had to use a cheat code to get through one particular door. But other than that, it was beautifully designed and written. I just wish they would release a Primal 2!"
2,Primal: A watered-down Kain,"Folks, if you were going to purchase Primal to fill that adventure/exploration gap in your PS2 life, save your time and money. While Primal did add some interesting twists on explorative/gothic gameplay, it still falls short of being a title worthy of hard earned cash. Interesting and often beautiful environments are a plus here... but the figthing system is lame and repetitve, and the puzzles hardly merit mention. There is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in Primal. - The stop and start brawls with easy-to-kill monsters gets old really fast. This game is mostly comprised of clever cut-scenes and too much walking around. ..."
3,"Primal means glitch, i hate it when a game is filled with glithches","I am not going to waste time, i hate this game! not so much the game play but this game is filled with glitches, and it is very boring the kind of game that gives you a headache that last until you turn it off and then sweet relief. i don't have time for that kind of incompetence by games designers, i did not see this through i got stuck some where in a pool of water and got fed up, or! i did not save often so i lost all the other save points so don't over write just in case laters folks."
5,Bell Night Trail Bicycle Light Set - great value,"I recommend this set to anyone who bikes at night or dusk. The front light is very powerful and has even high/low beam! The rear light has 4 modes (ie fast flashing, steady etc...) very cool. The plastic case seem sturdy enough."
2,disappointing,"I love the features offered by these lights, however, like several other reviewers, the headlamp stopped working after two uses. Apparently it had faulty circuitry that ""blew"" after battery power was put through it a couple of times. Too bad. If the product had lasted, I would have given it five stars. Maybe it was just a single bad batch from the factory since others have had good luck with theirs. Definitely worth the price ... if it works."
2,Not a light for people who want to take it on and off,I used the headlight for a few weeks before the device that allowed me to take it on and off the bicycle broke. The headlight is now stuck permanently on the bicycle- even if I have to leave my bike out in the rain or in a high-theft area.
1,Typical Flawed Bell Product,"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue,unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy,wrong!This product is as shoddy as most ""BEll products"" are.The rear light went out first,then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of ""Bell products"" ever again.That's why i'm now a ""Cateye's"" and ""Nite Ize"" product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."
3,Bike lights,"Good item but it's a bit faulty. I would've given a full 5 stars if it wasn't defective. Nonetheless, still a good purchase."
5,Music that is more than compelling...,"The music comprising Cafe Atlantico is more than compelling, it is addictive. While I do not understand the language sung by Cesaria Evora, the language of music more than compensates. The musicians are outstanding and complement Ms. Evora's vocal gifts. This recording is a must for anyone who appreciates music at its finest."

5,great,Came quickly! I will be reading and hopefully using this book when I get my teaching degree. Important subject matter.
1,Don't waste your time or money,Too good to be true for the price? You bet and the battery life is so short that I most likely will properly dispose of the rest of them. You get what you pay for certainly holds true with this purchase.
2,Be careful buying this product,"Not sure if these batteries are new. They come in a blue plastic packaging, with no name on it. When I ordered these once before they came in a regular battery packaging. Last time I ordered they were in this flimsy blue plastic sleeve all taped up with scotch tape. Most of the batteries were looses inside the bubble mailer. They also took over a month to come in. The seller stated that it took so long because they come from China. Some of the batteries do not work. I guess you get what you pay for, and since I need so many of these batteries it seemed like a home run at first because they are so cheap. But now I think they might not be worth it. I also contacted the seller and explained the problem with no response back."
1,"Really cheap !! Work for less then min ,few explode","Really cheap !!worked for less then 1 min , few explode waste of m o n e y , ,"
1,Poor Quality... Don't Order,"This battery is supposed a 1.5V battery. None... None(!) of the 50 batteries arrived with more than 1.3V and most were worthless at less than a volt. Shame on Amazon for letting such bogus product be sold via Amazon! Once again, if the deal looks too good to be true, it probably is!"
2,sub par,Some of the batteries do not work. My son was disappointed as these were for his hexbugs. Next time i will not look for the cheapest price
2,crappy batteries,"My order arrived quickly and was well packaged. However, out of 50 batteries only 15 actually worked. The rest were DOA. I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time,"No name cheap batteries, I took a shot because they were so cheap. They showed up, half had already exploded, and the rest were already on there way to doing so, not filled correctly when manufactured, or not stored correctly. The few that were ok, lasted for about 2 hours. The only good thing was the price, they were soo cheap it wasn't worth my time to return them."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this pack hoping to save some money on the typically expensive button cell batteries but at least half of the batteries in the blister pack look like they are bulging. After 2 weeks some of them started to leak. Of the ones that are left, I'm hoping that they are somewhat useable but it's simply not worth my time to return them. DO NOT BUY this product unless you want to take a chance that 10 out of the 50 batteries are actually useable."
4,"10% waste, but still a great deal","I tested all the batteries, 10% of them were completely dead, the rest were at 1.4v and 10 more at 1.5 volts. Still a great deal. Mine were packaged in a blue plastic tray, which was sandwiched between another tray with tape, thus keeping the batteries contained. Mine were not in the blister packs. When receiving them I had two batteries that had come out and probably shorted out and cased the 10% failure I experienced. Personally I would have run some tape over the top of the batteries to keep them in the tray, then covered them with the other tray to hold it all together. But again... This was such a great price that I dont care! I would buy again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,More than half of these batteries didn't work. I guess you get what you pay for! I would have given no stars if they'd have let me.
1,Trash don't waste your money,The way they are packaged for shipment amounts to placing them in a bag where they short explode and arrive dead.
1,Batteries don't work!.....,"Batteries do not work. Entire tray is dead, or AG13 is *not* equivalent to LR44. I did *not* order AG13!"
1,Isn't compatible with A76???,"I ordered this for the many battery-powered Thomas the Tank Engine cars for my little boy. I hadn't replaced many of them because of the expensive price of the batteries, but then decided to look online for a cheaper option. I was thrilled to find these, even if they didn't work long, at least there were 50. WRONG. They aren't compatible with A76. They seem to be the correct size, but they wouldn't stay in place in the battery compartment. I could get them to work if I put my finger in there and shoved the batteries up against the sides to get some connectivity. None of my exploded (like other reviewers noted) and the packaging was as expected (in a plastic sheet with bubble wrap around it) but you don't get what they say you are getting. Oh well, back to the battery-less trains until I find something in between the expensive and the not expensive. I returned the items."
4,"English dialog is convenient, but Italian version has better picture quality.","This is about the English language version. It really is very nicely dubbed, and I understood more than I did of the Italian version, which I borrowed from Netflix. But this is a movie you have to own!When the English versionCheeky! (Unrated English Version)arrived I was disappointed to find that the picture quality was not as good as the Italian version I borrowed from Netflix, which might have beenCheeky! - Unrated. Since I just had to see all those gorgeous scenes clearly, I decided, as a compromise, to buy the works of Tinto Brass Vol. II,The Tinto Brass Collection, Volume II Uncut & Uncensored, and I am happy to report that the picture quality is EXCELLENT, and of course no English censorship."
4,Very nice and scenic movie,"There is a lot to this movie to enjoy. The women are lovely, the scenes are well done, and it is a very enjoyable movie to watch with your partner. We watched it through twice in the first week, and we really had fun with it each time. The women are lovely, and the scenes are great. Enjoy!"
3,They're OK -- don't expect too much.,"They sound fine, a little scooped and a bit thin. But considering the price, they are OK. They are made in China. They advertise 91 dB 1w/1m. I've not tested this, but they do not sound that efficient to me. Pretty good highs. My stock speakers were blown, so I bought these. My stock speakers were probably better, so don't consider these an upgrade. What else can I say, they're OK."
5,Bought for my 2008 Mustang,"For the price, there are some of the best 6 x 8 speakers I have purchased. After replacing the stock speakers in my 2008 Mustang, I can hear a very noticable boost in the bass and a crisper high-end. These are by NO MEANS a competition style speaker so do not expect this to add a subwoofer style boost to your audio but it can enhance any stocker speaker and add more definition.The packaging came with all the materials needed to remount and even has an addition grill just incase it will sit in the open without your car covering it. Very satisfied, I have had them for almost a year and they still beat nicely."
4,satisfied,just installed these yesterday and i must say i'm satisfied with the purchase of these. for the price they're spot on. easy to install and they sound nice.
5,Speaker review,"I bought these to replace the worn out speakers in my Ford truck. They fit without any trouble, and sound good. They are very good speakers for the money. If you want really loud sound, you may want to upgrade. I am very happy with them, and the sound is fine for me when I occasionally ""crank it"" for some classic 80's rock song!"
1,review,This book is not really my ycup of tea. I probably won't finish reading it. It doesn't catch my interest at all.
2,Interesting but poorly written,"While Courtroom 302 provides an interesting look into Chicago's criminal Court, the author's style limits the book's appeal. Grammatical errors abound (whatever happened to good editing?)and there are several instances where the author contradicts his earlier statements. More importantly, the author never explores comments made by the key characters, asking why they felt certain ways or to explain and support their position. This is a glaring omission; especially when judicial misconduct or corruption is alleged.My advice - check to book out of a library rather and spend your money on one of the other book recommended by reviewers."
4,Courtroom 302,"This book is a candid look at life in Chicago's Cook County Criminal Courthouse. It covers the day-to-day actions of accused criminals, court officers, public defenders, prosecutors and judges from inside the courthouse and lockups.The book is well-written and fascinating, but at a certain point I felt that I had learned all I needed to know, and I was only halfway through te book. As much as I love hefty books, this would have been great if it hadn't been quite so long."
5,A definite MUST read!!,"This book has life changing potential. If you are married or know anyone who is this is a must read for you. The presentation of the material is in story format, which makes it not only an easy and entertaining read but also a very educational and informative read. It confronts the everyday issues that will tear relationships apart and offers solutions to help out. It is full of humor and heart, it will touch you and make you want to be a better person, to love more, and to love better. It will challenge you to be a better spouse and to encourage others around you to do the same. Grab a copy quick and get ready to read, because once you get started you won't want to put it down."
4,Excellent Resource for Military Terms,"I originally bought this book as I was learning arabic and working with several Arab military officers. One advantage is that this book appears to be based on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) resources which means that the terms have been reviewed by several Arab-speaking nations.The Arab military personnel, with whom I have shared this book, unanimously like it. As a result, they have requested several copies for their own use. (since the dictionary translates both ways)The only limitation of the dictionary is that is is far from complete and lacks some of the more basic tactical terms."
4,Mod. Mil. Dictionary,"Good comphrehensive list of different terms. One thing it is lacking is short vowels, so it is NOT for beginners........but Intermediate to Advanced unless you are able to get correct pronounciations of the words."
1,You must understand written arabac to use.,I bought this book for my husband deploying to Iraq. He was very disappointed. It is completely unusable to him. Their is no pronunciation of the words. (arabic or english)On the left side of the page is the word in english and on the right is the word written in arabic. That is it. You could not look up a word and find out how to say it.
2,Not detailed enough,"I've had this book through 4 cats and kittens, and if you have a really healthy cat who never develops any illnesses, it's great. I find myself using the Cornell Feline Health Center online for my cats.The diagnostic tree is just too vague, the descriptions of diseases are also too vague and there's just not enough information. Using a vet's resource center with a dictionary handy does you--and your cat--more good, especially if your cat has something really serious."
4,"Great Pans, Awful Lids","I bought this set to replace my 17 year old Farberware set because altho' still perfectly fine after all these years, I thought that thicker pans would cook better on my new gas stove. And they do, no doubt about it! Way less splattering and burning, which is what I was hoping for. HOWEVER ... my old pans had domed lids which allowed you to confine the condensation inside by quickly turning them upside down as you lifted them and you could even set them down on the counter this way. The KitchenAid pans have almost flat lids and the liquid usually ends up on the stove. There is no way you can set the lid down anywhere without making a mess. Very nice pans for the money, but I'm not sure I would buy them again."
2,Not what I was expecting....,"Shipping took forever!!! Said it would be here within a week, but took a little over 2 weeks to get here. In the product description it had said ""like new"" except for a little wear on the binding, but when I got the book (finally) not only was the binding almost falling apart, there was tons of highlighter and pencil markings on the pages. Ive ordered text books on here that were described as ""good"" and ""ok"" and when I got them they were in better condition then this ""like new"" textbook."
2,KD fan wrenches,This set is not for the 1999-2000 7.3. The large wrench is way to big (over 80mm). It should be 54mm. I emailed KD tools and they were clueless - they were not interested in resolving my problem or fixing the application label on their product. The vendor whom I purchased the set from did a good job.
4,Harmonic Ride on Line Again,"Favez has successfully evolved from mid-ninties emo-core into beautiful melancholic slow-fi. Along the lines of bob tilton, Radiohead, Unbeliveable Truth, Cobolt, and Sophia, but with a distinct ""sound of their own"" Favez is certainly a contender for most underrated artist/band. The songs are mostly acoustic and rather slow, making this album perfect for long drives. Night-music"
1,Very unhappy,"I am extremely unhappy with this product for the following reasons:1. It was shipped to me in damaged condition. The metal shell around the bluetooth keyboard was bent. I do not know if it works because I didn't even try it. It is very cheaply constructed.2. The ipad2 shell, which was supposed to be included, was missing.I am sending it back tomorrow asking for a full refund, including shipping and handling."
2,Not Great,"I purchased this as a Halloween costume. As other reviews note, sizing chart is way off. Adult small is REALLY small. The sewing comes out really easily too. Good thing I only needed it for one night. Not worth the price I paid."
2,The 80's Hated chubby folks,"I got this shirt in an extra large, and it is so snug around my mid section that I feel like The Comic Book guy from The Simpsons. However, there is no larger size available for this costume, so unless you are a die hard TNG fan, leave this alone and get the plus size shirts from Costume Craze, they look good without making you look like a fat boy. As far as authentic goes, these costumes are spot on, but that being said, fat boys need not wear spandex. Ever. Go with the plus size costumes for the new movie offered by Costume Craze, you will not be disappointed chubby people!"
2,Ok for Star Trek Fans,"I got this for a Halloween party and while it does have a good design and look it suffers from poor construction material and planning by the manufactures. The rank pips and Starfleet insignia that comes with the shirt are not metal but cloth that needs to be cut out of paper then glued on to the shirt. The fact that both Amazon, and the manufactures don't provide a sizing chart I bet causes many people myself included to be conned out of a costume that is too big or too small.For all of you Star Trek fans out there I would look for another costume that is made with better quality."
1,Super cheap quality,I returned it. The quality is super thin and cheap. Get the deluxe one. Also the sizing is off as well. a small size is extra small.
1,hi.,i don't understand why this book has about 30 empty pages in it.is this suppose to be like this ? if not i think mine has some printing erros . --------------------------
1,too oily on the skin,"The spray feels greasy on my skin. I would not want to put my clothes on right afterwards. The grease and tint will get onto your clothes. Nop, I am not happy with this product."
5,This CD is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've listen to some samples and my favorites are Misty's Song and Viridian City. My least favorite is 2BaMaster. I wish I know where to buy this CD so I can listen to it every day.By the way, is Misty really singing about Ash?"
5,Awsome,I love the PoKeRaP cos thats how I got my charter name. I could have chosen pikachu but its used 65 times. So I got Raichu. THANK YOU FOR THE POKERAP NAMES IN THE BOOKLET. Im lerning the names of pokemon. The rest is exelent. But the pkmn theme is my faverit.PS. Is Raichu #26?? Raichu@charter-il.com
5,THIS CD RULES ABOVE ALL OTHERS!,"It is insanely awesomely indescribeably great to have the full pokérap at my disposal. Now I know it all! Electrode, Digglet, Nidoran, Mankey..."
5,a must get for everybody!,"This CD is the best music I've ever heard. Even my brother ,who doesn't care about pokemon, loves it! I would recommend this CD to anyone. I've played it all the time since I got it."
1,And they call this music? I'm not impressed.,"The people singing have voices that sound worse than nails on a chalkboard. I thought the music would be decent, but there are only a few good songs! Uggh, I wish I had never bought it!"
5,A Must for Every Pokemon Fan,"""2BA Master"" is a must for every Pokemon fan. Its great to hear all the cool music, like the ""Pokemon Theme"" and ""PokeRAP"", from the show along with some new songs, like ""2B A Master"" and ""Everything Changes."" Team Rocket even have their own song called ""Double Trouble."" Also, the cd is enhanced. You can see the whole PokeRAP of 150 Pokemon on your computer. This is one cd you can just leave on, listen to, and have fun!"
2,i wasnt as good as i thought it would be!,i dont think its really that good and im a die-hard pokemon fan. i really think the music on the gameboy is better.
3,ok,"it was ok but this shows gamefreak's serious mass meadia it is generating. ""what kind of pokemon are you?"" and ""my best friends"" are the best songs and are the 11-12 boys anthems for my swim team"
5,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!,"This is awesome i could listen to this all day(especially what kind of pokemon are you!) THis cd is awesome, i play it everywhere. You a pokefan? know a pokefan? well this is the perfect gift for the pokefan within us all!"
4,it was good,"When I first saw the cd my friend had a cd that looked like a pokeball. I thought ok, it's a bootleg thing thing from Japan that I want but it'll be too expensive. then I start seeing the ad in all of the stores. So I pick it up here. I love it. the music is great, the songs are cool and it was cheap! But I don't think Misty likes Ash."
3,"I only listend to some clips, and they were O.K.","The clips I listened to were pretty good except for 'My Best Friends' and 'Viridian City'. '2.B.A. Master was pretty good, so I don't get why everyone hated it. Probably the best song that I heard was 'The Time Has Come (Pikachu's Goodbye)', even though it's so sad, it made me cry and I'm a GUY! Ever since I heard that on the show, I wanted to have it recorded, and now I do! I also liked 'Misty's Song', only I hope it wasn't Misty singing cuz' if it was, that's VERY creepy. I always thought she'd have an AWESOME singing voice so that would just kinda BITE if that was her voice."
1,Ruins the name,"I had expected something better from Pokemon. The CD is very horrible. Don't not buy this, it completely bytes."
1,Not good...,I'm very disappointed at this CD and its makers. I'm a fan of pokemon but I don't think this CD is worth buying. I think both Sailor Moon soundtracks are much much better.
1,THERE GOES POKEMON IT'S GOIN' TO LOSE IT'S BEESWAX,MISTY'S SONG IS THE WORST.IT'S TERIBBLE.LAST CHANCE FOLKS DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM.YOUR GOIN' TO BE BUM. PEOPLE NO MORE 5 STARS OR I WON'T LET YOU IN MY SITE
1,I hated it.,I thought this was a horrid CD. I expected ALOT better from pokemon. I was very disapointed.
5,I wish I had this CD,I WANT THIS CD SO BADLY...my friends drive me crazy with their obsession with Britney Spears and N Sync and Offspring...now I can't wait to be able to listen to what I want to hear!
5,Good series,The series is a serious and slow but good one. It makes you think what if; maybe there are witches and some crazy conspiracy theory where the government tries to cover it up. If you like stuff like that this is your series.
5,sweet,Great story. Good action. A good addition to anime collection. Cool powers and interesting way to hunt witches. the way the character developed her powers as the story progressed was pretty cool.
4,modern thriller,"I started this anime by renting the first disk -- and decided about 4 shows in to buy it. Like many Japanese titles, the big character decisions are late in the arc -- however, there is substantial development of the characters early in this slightly twisted series. Overall, nicely done and a good watch in the original japanese -- I have not watched the english version."
4,great film noir,"this is a great film noir series. The character of Robin even though she has all this power she is only 15 and the series stays true to that. Robin starts out as a young replacement ""hunter"" she sloowly learns to better control her fire-craft and creats some human bonds along the way. I recomend this series to anyone who doesn't like being spoon-fed plotlines but instead enjoys something a little more engaging."
3,Decent Speakers,"Got these to replace the battered ones in the doors. For the price, it's a good buy. The sound is crisp and sharp. Not too much bass though, but it's there. Will definitely compare to known brands. Thanks."
3,Don't Know -,I can't review the speakers. They weren't compatible with the pre-existing premium system in a 1998 Lincoln Towncar.
4,good,"so far so good, i like the dual mixture. i like the feeling on my face, but i don't know if it's doing anything....hmmm"
1,What you see on the cover has nothing to do with what's inside,"I thought the drinks would be tasty as well as healthy, but they require a juicer and taste awful. I will stick to my Vita Mixer and whole fruit."
1,no way,"I'm sorry. I guess I'm the only one who hates this extremely boring, and very repetitive style of D'n'B. The artists spoon feed you the same pattern all the way through while cheesy sounds float around all over the place. All the songs on this cd make me dizzingly ill. The Ideas exist but they bore the heck out of you with the same thing over & over & over again, how uninteresting. And you people call that art? The music in itself all sounds very cheap. Please dont get me wrong cuz I love DB, but this stuff is just ridiculous. Altogether, It's just a darn shame drum and bass has to sound like this when we all know it has SO much potential.Now, if you like D'n'B thats simply fun and yet artistic, get DJ DB's shades of technology. I listen to any music with some degree of artistic intelligence and that cd barely slides by alright. That should get your groove on and at the same time help you look at the many perspectives of D'n'B."
5,This book is truely worth it.,"I am an avid angler, living in the area most of the stories in this book take place. The Neversink River that is referenced many times in Alfred Miller's writing is my home water. I have a large library of fly fishing books and have many of the the great titles avalible at will, but this book.......... is ablsolutly briliant. I've read it many times cover to cover. The stories (which are divided into chapters) have a flow you normally don't find in fishing books. Everything from somber tones to comical laugh out loud funny is touched on in the different stories he tells. I don't know what else to say other then, for the price of this book don't be without a copy."
3,A let-down,"I have loved most of Cooper's novels, especially ""Closer"" and ""Guide,"" and this one actually has a riveting plot. The problem however is that the entire novel is emails and chat-room epistles, which of necessity means that the language is much more perfunctory and dumbed-down than usual. ""My Loose Thread"" wasn't that great either, so maybe Dennis needs to slow down rather than covering in effect the same material over and over with scant variation or deepening of effect."
1,What a Mess,"I read this book after a friend recommended it. What a waste of time.To begin with, there are weird editorial errors throughout. Either no one bothered to review and correct the errors, or it's some kind of literary gimmick that evades me. Either way, it's distracting and annoying.What to say about the ""plot"" - as such. The best thing I can say is that it can be argued that it is a dark comedy. But I somehow don't think this is the case. I think Cooper really takes what he has written very seriously. Especially since the ""About the Author"" page is included in the table of contents (I've never seen this).So - unless you get off to hustlers who ""look 14"" and enjoy reading violent masturbatory blatherings related to said hustlers, skip the book. A more talented writer might have given us something interesting. Here, it's just a big mess."
3,Wireless Temperature Station by LaCrosse,The price was good. The unit seems to work well. The outside monitor does not have a separate temperature screen. This is ok with me since I am usually looking at the main unit. The numbers are large. There is no backlight which makes for difficult reading in dark situations.
4,"Works well, short on features.","This station works well and was a great price, especially compared to other models, and was much cheper on line. However, I wish I had noticed that this is a TIME AND TEMPERATURE ONLY model. I would have liked one with a humidity reading also. But for Time and Temp, this one is great."
4,Great for the price!,"This is a nice wireless indoor/outdoor thermometer for the price. No bells & whistles, just time, date & temps. Outdoor sensor is compact and you can easily hide it so people can't see it sitting out on your porch. Only negative is that the display is a little hard to read in low light. Other than that, I love it!"
4,Hit or Miss,"We bought two of these as Christmas gifts for family. One is great! Temperatures are accurate, easy to set up, love the atomic clock. The other unit would not keep time, or give us either temperature readings. That unit is on its way back to Amazon and we hope the new unit works as well as the first unit that we bought."
3,Interesting Temperature Readings,"I bought this because an older model's outdoor transmitter, which lasted for years, stopped working. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the older model pick up this model's signal, so now I have two display (receiver) units.I got an interesting result after going through the setup (which worked as described and is pretty simple). With the outdoor transmitter sitting 3"" from both receivers, both displays show the same outdoor temperature. However, the indoor temperature on the older model was a degree hotter while the indoor temperature on this model was 4 degrees cooler. There were just inches apart.Other than that, it works as advertised. I really like the atomic clock feature, which resets the date and time automatically every night."
5,Redman for president,When my chauffeur Jan is behind the wheel he always plays Redman. One day I aked Jan why? He told me the Redman was the saxman. Later that day he gave me this album. Since that day i listen to it always and I want to learn more about the redman.So checking with Jan he pointed me to splendor of amazon.com. I listened....I really wanted to write a review too. This album is that good. Check Jan and me on route A1. Swinging long vehicle going thru soundbarrier. The album is that good.But when I read the woodcountreview I knew all was told.The artist play are really good. They sound like they had fun recording these songs. The compositions are funky and of high standard.
3,Good Album.....BAD Re-Issue!!!!,"I bought the cassette of the album back in the late 80's and really liked it. When I saw the re-issue CD was out I sold my cassette and bought the CD. BIG MISTAKE!!! I have 3 problems with this re-issue: 1) a whole verse (about a minute of the song)is taken out of ""Love Kills"", 2)the ending of ""Breakout"" is gone, and 3) the bonus tracks are just very boring demos (one is a drum solo? and the other is Vinnie puttering around on an acoustic guitar). I would much rather have the ORIGINAL version of this album on cassette with all the original tracks intact than this butchered remastered CD!"
4,Not a bouncy ball,"I purchased this thinking it was a giant bouncy ball, it is not. This is a soft rubber ball that needs to be pumped up with air. I do like the fact that it does not have toxins like phthalates or BPA in it like most US made balls similar to this, so we kept it anyways!"
4,Harry with no singing mostly,I liked Harry Connick Jr when he just played piano. This is as close as I could get to that. Some very nice tunes
5,The Cellist,I love the cello so this was an easy pick for me..the music is so beautiful...I so enjoyed every moment of the DVD and would recommend it to everyone.
2,"Uneven, unconvincing, superficial","Klizer lost his credibility on page 30 when he quotes Hess saying he turned his plane inverted so he could drop out and parachute down, and while he was dropping out he righted the plane and re-started the engine (so it would ""hurtle to earth""). This is physically impossible, and otherwise non-sensical.The uneveness is between the early pages, which have a jerky and coy quality reminiscent of a lot of low end writing, and a marked change in tone to the sweeping style of a professional historian. It seems that two persons are writing the book.Maybe it's the lack of consistency, but I get the feeling that the historian is paraphrasing somebody else.The footnotes are mainly to secondary sources, like newspaper articles. It seems the research was simply compiling statements by others without any independent original work"
2,Movie view,"What could have been a good movie you can't tell,because it was over edited.So sometimes you don't understand what's going on. You know, plot, character connection,Etc....However good acting by a cast of unknowns.Bravo"
5,This CD is great!,Fly to the Angels is one my favorite songs. This CD is great for someone just getting into hard rock. This CD ROCKS! I LOVE MARK SLAUGHTER!!!
1,lame! lame! lame!,"this guys whiney voice is enough to drive you insane! horrible cheesy rock pop songs,no metal at all, just gallons of aquanet hairspray and wimpy songs for the teenage girl crowd. give me sacred reich anyday over this wuss!!!!!!"
5,A stunning beauty,"A pretentionless, tightly controlled, balanced and skilful mix of clean, funny, speedy, romantic and dirty. Stunning highlights in the middle sections of ""One With Everything"" (track 8) and ""Another Alternative"" (track 11). This is absolutely fabulous."

4,Question,Does it have radium so that we can see time in dark during night without turning light ON ?
1,"Unreliable product, unresponsive customer service",I purchased 35 of these units for a special needs school. Two were defective out of the box and another two failed within 3 weeks. I have emailed La Crosse twice over the last 4 days and have yet to receive a response.With a failure of over 10 percent and a customer service group that doesn't answer emails I'd recommend staying away from this product.
1,Don't buy this clock,"It worked fine for about 24 hours or so, then the second hand stopped working. Someone else had written a similar review but I ignored it unfortunately. I tried to set the clock manually hoping the process would free up the second hand but it broke the rest of the clock instead. If I can muster the time or energy I may try to get my money back. Worst case I'll pay more attention next time to the bad reviews like the one I'm writing now."
1,Eats batteries,Doesn't ever connect to the time check. Spins around. Batteries die. Second hand sits still. Do not like it one bit.
2,Worked fine for two years,"I bought this clock for my daughter's room, and it worked fine until one day, it didn't. The hands started spinning endlessly until the battery wore down. I thought maybe it was a signal issue (though we hadn't moved the clock) so we tried relocating it. Nothing helped. We have another model of the same brand that's fine. Judging from the other reviews, I'd say don't buy this model. It's inexpensive, but unreliable. I have regular battery-operated clocks that have been in service and keeping time for 10-15 years... I bought these thinking it would spare me the hassle of resetting clocks twice a year. It didn't adjust automatically, so I had to take it down anyway to push the little button on the back. Lame. I'm sticking with manually-adjusted clocks, they seem to be more reliable and not really any more of a hassle."
1,I would not recommend this clock,This clock looks great and it worked okay for a while. Now the numbers just constantly spin. Occassionally it will randomly work but then it shows the time of the incorrect time zone. I would recommend investing your money in another clock. We have tried everything possible to get this one to work but finally a year later we have decided to replace it.
2,weak on picking up signal,"Its nice on the price, but it hard to pick up the time changing signal and hard to adjust by manualy. I wo'nt recommed it to my friend."
1,Worst of Amazon - 2 out of 3 borken,"I purchased 3 of these and two were not functioning properly out of box. I contacted support and they initiated a lengthy two week email guidance program, most of which was focussed on using good quality battries. After email support they asked me to ship these to La Crosse (at my expense) for warranty repair! SHAMELESS PPL."
2,The second hand stops moving after a while,I bought four and every single one of those has exactly the same problem--the hand for second stops moving after a while while the batteries are perfectly fine.I would've given it 4+ if there's simply no second hand. Why bother if you can't make it right? I don't really miss reading the second but it's an eye sore to have a hand that's not moving!
1,No Response,"I have a problem with this clock in that the second hand freezes at the 1 or 2 second mark and loses synch with the minute hand. I've sent emails beginning on 12/27/2010. I have received NO response from LaCrosse, not even an acknowledgment.LaCrosse Technology has a ""D+"" rating with the Better Business Bureau. Now I know why. STAY AWAY FROM LACROSSE PRODUCTS!!!"
4,Picks up Signal FAST,This was to replace a similar 2-year old atomic clock the Cats knocked off the shelf. The old one needed to be near a window or it would complain and not recieve a signal.The New one grabbed a signal the second I put in a Battery...WOW. I guess 2 years do make a difference.
5,No garbage here,"So what if this is all material from '92-'97? This is intended as a retrospective a ""Chronicle"" of what he has done. Not only does it have an excellent, punny title, but it features some master hooks. Dre's production, which is what is showcased on this album, not his rapping as the last reviewer assumed, is phenomenal. He is a pioneer and shaped the whole musical landscape for much of the '90s and complete redefined the genre of rap."
5,Just what we wanted!,"This pan is great-- traditional cast iron, preseasoned and ready to use. Shipping was fast and piece was well packaged."
4,Induction stove compatible,"I had purchased two other Sonoma-Williams Aebleskiver Pans in the past. Neither would work with my induction stovetop, and I had to give them away.As expected, this cast-iron pan works great. Anyone with an induction stovetop should know that this pan is compatible and heats up well."
1,Wonderfully bad piece of polemic,"This McCarthy-like piece of 1950's politics railing against world government is worth a read just to laugh at. Kamp engages in almost nothing but ad hominem attacks; he doesn't even try to actually debate the merits of world government until the final chapter. He slanders Einstein and Freud, and even doubts Darwinism at one point. He paints the world in black and white, in which every single citizen of the USSR was a firm follower and staunch supporter of Stalin, and any American ""Communist, Socialist, fellow traveler, or Left Wing 'liberal'"" is working either knowingly or unknowlingly for the Politburo to turn the whole USA into one giant gulag."
4,Very good video,"In general, the PQ is very good, there are moquitos noises in some scenes especially with the sky, this is not unique to this Blu-ray, in fact, it is the rule rather than the execption. The video is sharp enough that we can clearly see the freckles on Adela Quested's (Judy Davis) face. The quality of the video is quite even, but after I saw the PQ of the Battle of the Bulge, it makes me wonder why not all films can be mastered as perfect as that one."
5,phenominal movie-A passage to India,"This is one of my very favorite movies of all time. It shows a sharp contrast between India and the snobbery of the British who occupied it. The characters are beautifully done--Adela, who travels to India with her future mother-in-law, Mrs Moore. Adela came to India to find out her real feelings for Ronnie, Mrs. Moore's son. While there, she meets Dr Asiz and Mr. Fielding and the mysterious, mystical Professor Godbolli. Dr Asiz invites Mrs Moore and Adela to a picnic at the Marabar Hills, and while there Adela hides in a dark cave and escapes down the hill, accusing Dr. Asiz of rape. Mr. Fielding believes him innocent, and resigns from ""The Club""--in effect, from snobbish English society. Fabulous photography, great actors, and a great story---don't miss it."
2,SOME SWAN SONG....skaweeeak!,"just way too much expectation for Lean's monumentous attempt to display the culmination of his many years of acclaimed talent, after seeing Alec G. in drag I could only see afronts of decency in fimlmaking... I am so respectful of this art and wish I knew how this tragedy/comedy of errors occured. Still need to read his biography, hopefully some insight into his dementia, what a loss and exit method. Glad to hear an Indian loves breasts the size of Bombay melons, saved the script!!! sigh...."
3,Not David Lean's Best,As a huge fan of David Lean's this movie is probably the weakest of his creations. As usual it has all the grand panoramic views making it a visual treat but the plot seems disjointed and some of the actions of the characters are inexplicable. Compared to modern day movies though it beats practically all of them. I would recommend purchasing it and viewing it with the family.
4,shih tzu Perfect Petzzz from Amazon,"Looks real. Everyone who sees it thinks it is real until they touch it.Too bad it isn't a little more lifelike to the touch. I love to watchit breathe. My Dad who is 91 sleeps with it. It is a great comfort tohim having just lost his Bishon companion of 17 years. Amazon had thebest price and the service was excellent. It's educational value isnot that high because it doesn't do anything but sleep, but its lovability isa 5 star.--[...]"
3,Cute,I got this for someone with dementia as her dog is not in the best of health. She thought it was cute but didn't really take to it. It would help if it was alittle larger and the appendages were movable. Even the new soft version is hard in spots.
1,Don't waste your money,Once again it appears that most of the reviews for this book are by A Customer. Just like his other books it looks like the author is making up reviews to get his rating up on this book. Don't buy it it is a waste of time and money.
1,Bo-o-o-ring...,"I bought this album when I was 16, along with Stick-It Live. I wanted to have Slaughter's latest album, since I did like their ""Up All Night"" from their first album.I have to say that this album was so boring - I can see why grunge took over the scene - glam metal just became tired of singing about everything, glam metal bands were running out of ideas - that is the message I got from this album. The male cast of Full House comes to my mind when I listen to this album - that's how boring this album is. Don't buy it.Nowadays, when I tell people about Slaughter, people go ""Oh, isn't that a Satanic rock band?"" And I have to go ""No, that's Slayer."" It seems that the whole world has forgotten about Slaughter. I would recommend either Mass Slaughter (greatest hits) or Stick It if anyone wants to know what Slaughter is all about. This album is sooo booring."
4,A Balanced Review of Islam,"I am a Western educated Muslim reader and bought this book to try and actually understand how a Christian would see Islam and portray it to other Christians. I was pleasantly surprised to find this book written in a fairly objective manner, and even concialliatory at times. It shows a gentler and kinder side of how Christians may want to be; that is to have a more open, empathic, yet non-patronising approach to other religions, especially Islam--a religion that has been unfairly portrayed by the mass media. While this book may be a good introduction from a Christian perspective, I would also recommend another book for those wanting a quick and light overview of Islam, i.e. ""Islam for Beginners"" (A Writers and Readers Documentary Comic Book) by Nabil Ibrahim Matar, which is also appears to be written for non-Muslims. (This book is also carried by Amazon.)"
2,Not good for the Kindle,"I think this is probably a good book in paper format, but it just doesn't work well on the Kindle. Maybe language books in general are not going to work with the Kindle. The exercises are images so the text can't be resized. Some are very difficult to read and others are impossible to read. I also imagined that I wouild be able to enter the answers to the questions in the Kindle as notes, but it does not work because the exercises are images."
5,Great glycerin soap with a great scent.,Love it. I've gifted this soap to family members who love it as well. The quality of the soap is very high and the scent is very natural but not overpowering. Makes for a pleasant shower.
4,Very interesting and detailled book,"This book gives a very detailled description of the joint pathologies, looks at different causes, genetic, bacterial or viral. The section on arthritic pain is a little short, even though pain is one of the most important symptoms of the disease. But some of the world's authorities in the field have contributed to this book, and it is very interesting to have such a group putting their knowledge together."
3,Look at the dates. This is an old product,"Canon no longer offers this so you are either buying one that has been on the shelf for awhile, a refurbished one or a used one.Reviews from 2003 seem to say it is a great copier though."
1,Diapointed,"Nothing new here that you wouldn't have in your notes somewhere. Very Elementary, not worth buying. Save yourself the money and just do online searches of the content."
4,21st C. Fusion,"Across the span of her five albums Najma Akhtar has been moving further and further from her ghazal roots. ""Vivid"" finds her suspended in a deep club mix of percussion loops, phat synthesizers and hip-hop beats. She layers her voice into choruses and call-and-response episodes in addition to singing soaring leads, and her voice is still one of the purest, most gorgeous instruments in music.When she sings in English the lyrics detract from my enjoyment because they're pretty twee, but more than half of the album is in Urdu and I have no idea what she's saying."
3,Buy a History and Explorers Guide instead,"Was it too hard to include a map????? Thank God I had already downloaded one from Mass Fish and Game. The History and Explorers Guide is much more complete, has the same information and more, is better written, more pictures....yada yada yada."
4,In case you are replacing your original copy....,"Just wanted to point out that this compilation is meant to be (by which I mean when it was originally released in the UK) a 2 disc set, one called North and one called South. I ordered this only to find out that on this US version you only get the one disc (North). It is still very good, but just thought I would warn those expecting a two disc set."
3,NE 1996,An OK chill out CD but the second cd is better in my opinion. Actually I prefer East Coast NE to chillout to. I'm all for chilling out and letting myself go to the music but this CD for me doesn't go anywhere. It gets me up when you hear Orbit but after that...Lhasa for almost 11 minutes and even that track runs out after 6 minutes. If you wanna a good mid 90s chillout cd I recommend Platipus Vol 3. The mixing on NE is top notch because it was done through a computer and filters as much with 1200s. I think it came out in 94 but I would recommend Paul Oakenfold JDJ Vol 5 either the brainiak or moonshine release. Earth Volume 6 is good to chill out to.
3,bags told me to get it.,i listenned to sasha and john digweed while driving for three hours. it made the trip go faster but i don't recall hearing any bass notes.
1,yuck,"when i think trance i think club music not this strange collection of electronic music. Gaia, Goa, Underground or whatever it stinks on ice. you would be better off going with gatecrasher cd's or ministry of sound if you want something to move to."
2,Warning !,"Just so you know...do not expect anything trance-like from late work from sasha, this is pure ambient trance, very slow, not very enthusiastic. So if you are looking for a dance-high energy type of trance, this is not the one. If you are looking for a dark, soft, kind of trance this maybe it. Also the tunes here are a little bit old, ranging from 91 to 96."
3,Not my favorite effort,"After reading many glowing reviews of Sasha and Digweeds Northern Exposure series, I was pretty excited to hear this effort. I owned individual efforts by both of these DJ's from the Global Underground series. But, for my tastes, it really didn't hold my interest as well as either of thier GU solo efforts. The pace was much slower for one. I kept expecting it to pick up but it really never did. While this is a very clean and harmonic effort, if you are looking for a little faster paced trance effort, I wouldn't start with this one."
3,Bob you'r pushing your luck!!!,"I normally buy Bob James Music without listening,mistake.With a line up like this how can you go wrong? EasyIts the writing of the songs that count as well.I am willing to wait just a little bit longer between releases for the ussual quality.Jazzman RayFrom the U.K."
1,"Horrible, Wretched, oh my g--","This is the type of video that makes you wish you could have your precious time back.It is so horrible, boring, uninteresting. Could the people actually involved in it sit through it?I strongly advise everyone out there to do something better with their time!"
3,Too preachy for its own good,"Uneven mockumentary from Dirk Shafer that can never quite decide what it wants to be. It goes on way too long (although it clocks in at less than an hour and a half) and is very repetitive. Worst of all it makes the mistake of veering away from comedy in the last half hour or so into the realm of pathos and preachiness, as it tackles issues like outing, homophobia and AIDS. Preachiness is bad enough in a drama, but fatal in a comedy.Still there funny parts and funny characters, especially Lady La Flame (Rhonda Dotson), exotic dancer and Dirk's self-professed number one fan. Shafer is sweet and appealing as he struggles to extricate himself from the quagmire of his own making.Not a bad movie, but not a terribly good one either."
4,Watch review,Well constructed. Keeps time accurately. Clips to my belt loop. Works well for me as I am handicapped and cannot use one hand.
1,simple bump changes hand positions,This thing changes time each time it is slightly bumped. The carabiner and housing is rather sturdy but the first sentence is the deal breaker. I do not recommend this watch at all.
5,Excellent watch...Well worth the price,"I had one these for the last 10 years before it finally crapped out on me. Let's face it, it's more prone to abuse clipped on your belt loop than around your wrist, so 10 years was way more than I expected out of it, so when it finally conked out I immeadiately ordered another one without even thinking about it. Easily the best watch I've ever owned. The only thing is that eventually the paint will start to chip off but that's to be expected when wearing it clipped to your belt loop (lifting things, leaning or rubbing against things). If you wanted it to stay pretty, shiny and new looking you would be wearing a wristwatch, not something clipped to your belt, right?"
5,The only blender you should need,"I drink protein shales every day and was getting tired of my old Cuisinart blender. It was a good blender but for some reason it was turning my water brown or green so I had to get a new one. I got this Waring witht he stainless steel caraffe. It is excellent! It blends easily, chops ice much easier than my Cuisinart and my shakes even taste better. I like the stainless caraffe because it gets and stays cold longer than glass."
5,great product,it is perfect for making one margarita or one smoothie. It is powerful and strong blender also easy to clean too.
5,Great Blender!!,"My old belnder broke and it was hard to find a good one to substitute. I actually had a very simple and cheap model, but it seemed the old ones were better than the new models. The jars were seemed not to be shaped right and there was always some food left over in chunks when I wanted all to be pureed.After trying 2 other very good brands and having to return them I finally decided to try the waring. And what a great blender it is! Somewhat noisy, but I really don't mind that when the appliance gets the job done.My smoothies came out smoothier than ever, and the pureed soups were velvety creamy. Definitely a 5 stars product, and worth every penny spent on it!"
1,Broken Switch,"Blender came with a broken switch out of the box. Hard to believe this was missed before shipping. If this is Waring's quality control, I don't have much faith in their products."
4,Juicer,"We juice a lot of oranges and have been thru several juicers. I was looking for a sturdy juicer that could hold up to the task of juicing bags of oranges. This Waring is a work horse. It's motor is true and does not waver under pressure. When you hold the orange on the rotating juicer there is no hesitation and it continues in one direction (some change direction when the pressure changes). The only thing I dislike is the juicer head is not as aggressive as I would like. The ridges are pretty smooth so I am required to use more hand muscle to squeeze the orange down. If the ridges were larger it would work better. There is no pulp adjuster like some, but we like pulp so it is good for us. I tend to squeeze the pulp down the rotating sifter with a spoon on this model since the sifter basket does not spin fast enough to get all the juice out. Overall I think the motor will outlast everything. Too bad there is only one size juicing head."
3,Juicer,"This seems to be a decent juicer. It filters most of the pulp and cleans out the skins, minimizing waste. Clean up is pretty easy as well."
3,"Fantastic motor, but heavy and fragile.","Fantastic motor, but heavy and fragile. 4 screws keep the plastic casing and the metal base together and if the plastic breaks you will not be able to repair it. This product could last a lifetime because of the reliability of the motor, but it is heavy and if it slips from your hands and accidentally falls, even a foot high fall, the screws will tear the plastic casing and this is the end of it. It happened to me."
4,Very solid horror novel,"Kenyon makes an impressive debut with this small-town-faces-terror novel. The expected comparisons have been made to the early work of Stephen King, but the mood is different, and Kenyon is too savy a talent to settle for something that obvious. This is a very solid horror novel, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he comes up with next."
3,Not sure why this book has such high marks,Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book but it was average horror to me. Nothing stands out in this book as completely memorable. The characters were well developed and the story itself was creepy but I certainly wouldn't consider it 'scary'. What I did like about this book was the setting and the feel of the ordinary town folk and how they were encompassed in an old unknown evil. Pretty good book for a first try.
4,very fun read,"When i first started this book i thought that it was OK, but as i turned the pages, i found i couldn't put it down. This was a page turner and the ending was just as good. A very good novel for new horror writer, Nate Kenyon and a strongly recommended must read."
1,Send Space Ape back to his home planet please,"The beats are decent. The MC is total garbage and pretty much ruins the album. If it was just the music without the whack, mumbling, incoherent MC it would be an all right album. I would suggest getting the actual albums of some of the artists and not bothering with this mix."
1,problems,i placed an order for this item along with 3 other items. This particular item did not come with the other 3 although the packing list said it was there. I contacted amazon who shipped me out another one. Problem is amazon is now charging me for 2 of these! I have attempted to contact amazon who just keeps telling me to return the item....The only one i ever had was the second one they sent (which is the only one i received). no phone number to call and responding to their e-mails doesn't work. This is the first time I am extremely DISSATISFIED with amazon.Good luck everyone
5,A show that is pure fun,"Forget all the drama that is teenagedom, the obnoxiousness that is people, and embrace the show for its incredible musical segments that make the rest of it worth going through. An incredibly talented cast whose careers are just beginning. The music is pure joy, it brings back all that used to be great about MTV and VH1."
5,Great stuff!,This is one of my favorite episodes. It is a sad one but done extremely well. It is difficult to say more without giving it away. The whole cast does a lovely job.
5,GLEE - 2 ANOTHER GREAT SEASON!,"Glee is one of the most fun series that I've ever seen. The music is nostalgic as well as contemporary.The story lines are brilliantly written for each character and their acting abilities are superb. Ifyou've never seen Glee before, buy all 3 seasons. You will be entertained and moved emotionally. Plusit is a great way to reduce stress because you'll be singing right along since the song choices areall familiar. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,awesome,"I gor it on time, the box was sealed and it works perfect...Can't wait for the fourh season dvd"
5,Glee,"As people hated.. I mean stated above about the new season of Glee. I think this season of Glee was one of the most unquine esopides. It showed Kurt's love life and more of a style of choices. I do agree with song selction. To me, a downfall when they used Justin Beiber as model for an athem (Esp. 13 COMEBACK) and Sam (Overstreet)and (Dot-Marie) did a fantsic job as guest stars for the season!"
5,"Good, but","I love Glee, and am enjoying that I now have the 2nd season, but it began to skip, and I would have to take it out and let it cool off. But it's a great DVD set"
1,never got my dvds,I never got my dvds. I purchased them September 25th. I filed a claim with Amazon a week ago and have not heard anything about a refund or my dvds since. Also I sent countless messages to the seller with no reply. The Season is great though I ended up renting it from blockbuster becuase I did not want to wait another month to hear anything about mine I ordered.
3,Glee Second Season,Unfortunately we had to return the first disc set; discs 5 and 6 were skipping. The return process was easy and we received a replacement set soon afterwards. It'll take a little bit to check out all these discs to make sure each works.
3,Glee,"The season itself was amazing, but there was one disc that didn't spin right, and skipped around in one episode. It was frustrating that this happened because not only did it make a lot of noise when it was spinning, but I had bought another season 2 set before that did the same thing, so I was hoping this one would be different. Other than that everything else works fine."
5,Perfect,"No problems with shipping, brand new dvd, recipient starting watching the disks the following day. It is packaged as one dvd (compact) but inside there are probably 8 sleeves filled with DVDs. Good season!"
5,wonderful music!,this a great quality CD! Shirley temple songs make me feel happy! I love this CD! The sound quality is great!
3,ProTan,Product works well but care should be taken as my Wife had an allergic reaction when this was used in conjunction with DreamTan which is needed for complete and dark enough coverage for body building competitions.
4,instant tan,This product worked wonders for me. I would really use it again and again. It went a long way for me.....
3,Not long lasting,"I was pleased with the product. Went on evenly and wasn't as orange as regular bronzers, but the first time you shower, a majority of it comes off, which makes it look more natural, but I like to have a dark bronze look."
3,Not exactly Naked,"I'm not really feelin this after a couple listens - there are a couple good tracks; the 2nd+3rd tracks are my favourite on the album right now, but even those suffer from whatever fever Rene has right now.I agree that this is way overproduced... Basement Jaxx suffer from this too - fantastic production but they lay it on waaaaay too thick, with wierdball chords that are just too sacchirin sweet. Forgettable lyrics for the most part as well.And dont get me started on those Water Psalms. I have no idea.I was looking for a good take on naked-style house...Just waaaay too flashy r+b for my tastes.But 2 + 3 are dope. :)"
2,"While accurate, this book is very difficult to understand!","Palmer and Colton's A HISTORY OF THE MODERN WORLD is extremely accurate and informative. There are very few illustrations or photographs to complement the text. The writing is written for a college student, not a high school student. I think the book should be written in more readable terms, because it is difficult to pick out the key ideas of each section and sub-section. It is organized efficiently, but it is organized in a manner in which it is difficult to locate information without reading from cover to cover. In conclusion, I would buy this book only if you are an experienced reader and you already have some background about European History. This book is not designed for a beginner."
3,Practical Man Bag,This would get a 5 star rating if it had a decent shoulder strap. I can't believe what a well made bag it is except for the shoulder strap which is really where you need it to be comfortable. The pluses are the many pockets. It has a ton of compartments for just about everything. Even my small HP laptop fit. It's sturdy and looks masculine/college-ish. I took it to Spain for a 2 week vacation because I didn't want to take my big college backpack. This bag was perfect for that. Please Mobile Edge upgrade the shoulder uncomfortable shoulder strap.
4,Has some things that could have been better,"Everyone else said all the good stuff, here are my thoughts:It's nice that they have a little pocket at the bottom in front of the netting, for say an over sized book or something, but the buckle that holds the cover is not adjustable at all, so if it is large, it won't be able to fit. If it's smaller it might fall out because there are no horizontal straps.The little pocket for the audio device at the top could have easily been a tiny bit longer to accommodate an ipod touch in a case.The velcro teeth inside sticks to the soft interior fabric, so unless you just cut that strap and cover the teeth, it will probably eat a hole after you tear it off a few hundred times. I'll just cut the strap or find something to stick over it. I got it initially for just my ipad. It's way too big for that alone, unless you have books..I like it and will probably keep it."
1,Good when it was working...,"dead after year and a half of light usage.$45 down the drain.good work lacrosse.this is the most powerful charger I've ever owned, and the most short-lived.dont judge a book by its cover, but this charger looked cheap when I first got it, and explained why it was short-lived."
2,18 month lifespan,Loved the product for the 18 months it worked. With a 1 year guarantee it lived just past it's deadline.
1,poor reliability,"I know many people like the product and its features -- me too, initially. But after using it for just over a year now, the slots ""3"" and ""4"" starts displaying ""000"" no matter what kind of batteries I put in. Sometimes, it would seems to start charging, showing the current. Then in a few seconds, it will go to ""000"". The manual says it will show ""000"" when overheat. But for me, the ""000"" will show up even when it first started and the unit is cold! I have the firmware 33 BTW. Slots 1 and 2 seem to be fine. Just 3 and 4. But charging 2 batteries at a time is a pain..."
