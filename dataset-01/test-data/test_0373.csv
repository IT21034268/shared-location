1,Injustice to Military Justice,"Forget for a moment Travolta's poor acting and the deadpan reading by the title character, forget the numbingly overwrought script; simply put, military justice does not work this way. Whoever wrote this tripe knows nothing of the UCMJ, the code of laws governing military personnel. Despite Travolta's statements, you do have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, etc. Garbage. Additionaly an injustice is done to victims of sexual assualt. The psychological trauma involved with such a heinous act is treated in a bloated, cavelier and compassionless manner. This movie angered me for the obviously offhanded manner with which it treated these topics."
3,Predictable,"The General's Daughter is not a bad film, but it is just so completely predictable. One problem is that the DVD case states that there is a twist ending, so right from the start of the film you try to work out who will be the guilty person and it's not hard to pick, basically just look for the most unlikely characters and, as always, you've got your man. Even if you don't know exactly what they did or how they did it, you pretty much know who is going to be responsible right from the start. The acting is excellent, it is well paced and Madeleine Stow is looking as beautiful as ever, but you've seen it all before. Still worth a look, though probably not one to buy."
1,one of travoltas worst movies due to a bad script,John travolta has made some classic modern movies and this isn't one of them. Even in his slump periods where he made some obscure movies they were better than this. In fact this one is so bad that it claims it's based on real events which is not the case. In fact even my most liberal friend thought some nutcase must have written this one!I can say that yes there's crime in the military and rapes and such but this one seems to have a motive of just being antimilitary instead of telling a good story about bad people in the military which is acceptable. This is almost as bad as 'the valley of elah' and like that one you had excellent actors lost in a movie driven by a underlying idea of smearing rathering than telling a story. That one though was far worse than this one! Travolta acts as well as ever but he can't save this one.
4,The Daughter was a bad girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is a very good movie. Travolta made a string of good movies and this was one of them. He has a very good role in this movie that suits him well.
3,The General Daughter,The movie is too short and I think they could have done a better movie from this novel.I suggest reading the book before you see the movie.
2,Too much Dialogue!,"""""The General's Daughter"" had the potential to be a strong and well done movie but it failed in doing so.....by dragging this movie on and the plot moving at a slow pace, I was starting to fall asleep and I didn't really care at one point what happened....I thought the scenes with the daughter getting attacked were a little too gruesome......""The General's Daughter"" should've included some more action in it......that way I would've been on the edge of my seat and really cared about who killed his daughter.....after a while, I didn't really care I just wanted the movie to end!"
3,OK,Pretty good movie. James Woods did a great job (as usual) and John Travolta did a pretty good job. It definitely keeps you 'on the edge' and keeps you interested and guessing until the end....There is one disturbing rape scene that I wish I had known about BEFORE I saw the movie.
1,ALERT: There may be a problem with this title...,"I've purchased many titles from the MP3 Download Library here at Amazon and they've been great. This title is currently the sole exception.I have reported to Customer Service that there appears to be a problem with the source files on their servers. The fidelity is awful, and not up to the high standards that every other album and track I have purchased has met.If you are reading this review (and I have not posted a retraction), I would not purchase this title."
4,"So far, so good!","In addition to being scared out of my ming during flights, I'm one of those people who has extreme anticipatory stress before the actual flight. I bought this CD ahead of a big European trip I'm going on this summer. After listening to this CD for a week, ALL of my anticipatory fear is GONE. I don't have disaterous thoughts, and I am calm when I imagine the take off and flight. This is a huge breakthrough for me, as my fear usually begins months ahead of a scheduled flight and increases steadily. I haven't flown yet, so I gave the CD 4 out of 5 stars, but if it works half as well in the sky as it has so far, then it's a 5 for sure."
5,This WORKS!,"Flying never bothered me when I was young. When I got older, however, it made me progressively more nervous. After one flight where I had a particularly hard time, I decided to buy this CD. Now, you MUST do exactly as it says, or it won't work. You have to wear headphones, and you have to listen every day for a few weeks before you fly. But it is very relaxing, and I kept myself and my mind in complete control during the entire flight both ways. Trust me - this works very well."
2,for fans ONLY,"You are a big fan of Alanis then you will certainly like this DVD. Do not expect exciting stuff.It's not really a documentary about Alanis but mostly about Indian culture and Great Canyon beauties. Alanis is here to sing some songs (UNPLUGGED) in the middle of mother nature in front nobody except the camera !!! She loves it but I wonder if it's really interesting.For sure, it really shows that Alanis must be a simple and kind person with a great talent. So if you like Alanis to death or Indians or great canyons, then this stuff is for you. I recommend Feast of Scraps if you really want great music and great documentary."
3,TOO EXPENSIVE,"I spent half the price of this outfit for 2 other outfits I found here at Amazon. They were packaged so pretty, had all the accessories. This had all the same stuff, double the price, and didn't even come in a pretty box!1you can look for much cheaper and better packaged items here at Amazon"
5,There's more to life...,"I've read hundreds of books in my life but only a handfull have really touched me. This is one of them. It's a simple story but it's told so well you can feel the frustration of the main character. I read this book a few years ago and to this day, it makes me wonder what my dog is really thinking or seeing. Most books have reviews that say things like, ""couldn't put it down"" or ""made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up"". This book really did all that and more. If you're looking for a good quick book, this is the one."
5,Heather Madsen,This is one of the Best books I've read in years.It is very Heart warming. James Herbert knowshow to make a great boo
1,Cover for underwater computer,"I purchased this item to protect the face of my scuba computer from scratches. However, the cover scratches very easily and if it gets any type of ""gunk"" on it, it is hard to clean. However, better the cover than the computer face. So as long as these covers continue to be available, I shall continue to order them. It may be helpful to cover the face of the cover with some type of clear tape."
5,The coolest cd,The first time I saw the music vidio and heard the song I got it right away. I loved the song and couldn't get it out of my head for days. This cd is a must have.
4,a good grown-up blues album,"A few years ago, when I first heard Train on the radio, I wanted nothing more than for them to go away. Granted, ""Meet Virginia"" was a good song, but it was way overplayed. I thought that I would never like the band or any of its music. However, when I heard ""Drops of Jupiter"" I could not think of anything but Train. While the title track is by far the best, the rest of the album is a solid rock record, which you don't see very much of today. With a blend of blues, folk rock, classic rock, and even a little country, Train proves that it will not fall into the bottomless pit of one-hit wonders."
5,The Sound of Great Plains,"Long-selling Trainfs masterpiece album in 2001 is one of my all time favorite modern rock albums as well. It would be the fitting album to play when you drive along the highway in mid-west plains. It has classic rock feel and a bit country-rock flavored. It sounds similar to Vertical Horizon, and Taxiride, promising Aussie rocker. Most of the album tracks are acoustic and the sound is soothing.DROP OF JUPITER, the first single has classic 70s pop rock taste, and GETAWAY, MISSISSIPI, HOPELESS, are some of the wonderful acoustic tracks that makes the album worthwhile to purchase. RESPECT is Inxs and Taxiride flavored up-tempo pop rocker. ITfS ABOUT YOU provides excellent chorus somewhat similar to CSN and Taxiride. SHEfS ON FIRE that became a single cut also has soothing and refreshing chorus.Recommended for 70fs classic pop rock fans and for modern rock fans that love Matchbox 20 and Vertical Horizon."
4,Not what I expected,"this CD is not what I expected. I loved the song Drops of Jupiter so I bought the CD. The rest of the songs are way different than Drops of Jupiter. Most of them have more of a country feel. At first, I really didn't care for any of them, but after the first time I listened to it, the rich tones really registered and the fact that it was a fabulous CD worked itself into my brain. The only song on here I don't like is Respect."
5,Not So Bad,"hey ya'll out there who read this!! anyway, after i bought the first train cd i thought they're a garuntee for one hit wonders. I mean common they only had one hit on their debut album! but now i am a believer, i love ""drops from jupiter"", and pretty much the whole cd, i feel train has hit gold again...or should i say platinum."
3,Disappointing!,"I love ""Drops of Jupiter""(the song)! I mean, who doesn't =)! But, I was disappointed by the rest of this CD. I was hoping for more songs like DOJ, but most of the songs don't really resemble it. The best tracks are ""She's On Fire"", ""Drops of Jupiter"" (duh), ""Missippi"" and maybe ""It's about you"". This CD isn't really hard rock. In fact, I can fall asleep with it on! If you are a huge Train fan, then get the CD. But, listen to it first, and maybe buy it on sale!"
2,one-hit wonder,"As an 80's music fan, couldn't get into this cd. I bought it for ""Drops of Jupiter"" which is a very melodious tune that I have enjoyed. Probably should have recorded that song from a friend. Decided to stick with the music that makes me feel good."
5,Great video,"Both our 2.5 yr-old and 5-year-old love this video. It has simple, gentle dialogue, and the characters from books that our kids love."
3,Not enough time to enjoy it,"It's a nicely narrated Richard Scarry story, but it cuts too short, not allowing a child time to learn the main characters. For the price I paid I would have preferred 2 or 3 Scarry episodes."
1,Defective,doesn't play in any DVD player for some reason. Doesn't look like a bootleg copy or anything and even has authentic packaging so I don't understand....
4,"Great, great game!","Okay, this game is really cool! The graphics are amazing, when you're playing and in the non - playable scenes. The controls are simple, and easy to learn, so you can be whooping robot butt early in the game. The enimies are really cool, and they seem to be able to learn your regular moves, so be ready for a challange later in the game. The sub - weapons are amazing! When you are in close range of your enemy, instead of shooting a weapon, you grab him and throw him off somewhere! The sub - weapons range from throwing dagger - like weapons, to shooting a huge laser! What's cool is that once you beat the game, you get two - player! Once you replay the game, the missions are different, too! The only bad things in this game is... The story: It's A little cheesy, but it's interesting. The length: This game, if you're a true gamer, could be beaten in a day to two days. So, if you like Gundam Wing, get this game!PS. It comes with a playable MGS2 demo! I give it two thumbs up!"
5,You can never go wrong with Giant Robots,"Well, let's first say that I have have yet to see Hideo Kojima do a bad game, and Z.O.E. is no exception. Like all of his previous and up coming works, Z.O.E. features a complex storyline that twists with every step you take thoughout the game. Also like his others works, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The control interface is quite seemless and within a matter of minutes you'll find yourself doing complicated and highly powerful short and long range attacks. I will say that the part that I enjoy the most is the close in engery sword duels with the enemy drones.If you are a fan of Macross, Neo-Genesis, or even Escaflowne will find this to be a fine addition to their PS2 collection, and those who are fans of Hideo Kojima will enjoy both Z.O.E. and the Metal Gear: Sons of Liberty Demo."
4,better be a sequil soon!,"When you first put this game in, after the opening scene, if you are familiar with metal gear solid you can tell that the game is made by the same people. After the first battle in the game you are just like, WOW!!! After the action stops, you want more; you get more. The controll is great! The sound is great! Story is great! why did I only give it 4 stars? The game is so short, I can't believe it. Thair better be a sequil to carrie on the story further more. As for the mgs2 demo, all the more reason to warrent a purchase."
4,A Great Game,"This game is great. It has outstanding graphics and easy-to-use controls. It may not be the longest game in the world (I beat normal mode in 3 hours) but after you beat it a versus mode is unlocked which gives it high replay. If you just want a good challenge, start a game on very hard or play versus against a high level PC while you are on a low level. This game combines mech combat, a tiny bit of puzzle solving, and RPG elements making this game very active and fun. The music is somewhat hypnotizing and never gets repetetive. I would definately reccommend this game to mech combat fans as well as newcomers to the genre.PS- Don't buy this for the metal gear demo. The demo may be good, but remember that it is only a demo worth maybe 5-10$"
3,for Jack Bruce fans only,"Jack Bruce can't seem to get a break. Here is an exciting and gifted performer who thrives in a live environment. Yet every attempt to show this has been met with poor to mediocre results from the Cream Farewell concert to this session. This was a terrific band that easily flowed from jazz to rock and could keep up with Jack's own virtuosity. But the production values are awful, and the song selections, other than the Cream and early solo material, are uninspiring. And the sound is pretty close to disasterous. It's also frustrating that the camerawork focuses mostly on the guitar player when I wanted to see Bruce's phenomenal fretwork, as well. And one last complaint - it's awfully short. And NSU was cut to shreds, as the encore. Considering there's nothing else out that documents Jack as a solo performer on DVD, it's still a ""must-have"" for devoted fans. But it will not be a saitsfying experience."
1,Incomplete US Ripoff Edition,"This DVD is a big disappointment, and a real ripoff since it is working with a badly edited cut down version of this show.The German DVD ""Jack Bruce at Rockpalast"" provides nearly twice as much of this Essen 1980 show (105 minutes plus an interview). That DVD set also has two more shows on it (and clocks in at over 280 minutes of music as opposed to the 60 minutes here). Unfortunately for most buyers the German edition is a Region 2 PAL product that won't play on standard US equipment. It's pretty much worth buying a multi-region, multi-standard machine just to see it (or you may be able to play it on a computer)."
5,great,have been driving with these now for several months and they have been dust free quiet and stop well i am very pleased with these pads and the price
4,A Good Read,"It was a good quick read. Disappointed when I realized this was re-published last year. It originally came out in the 1980's. Having read many of Nora Robert's books, it was pretty predictable, but the characters drew me in."
5,Fantastic as always!,Nora Roberts truly knows how to weave mystery and romance together for a great book! Look forward to many more.....and soon please!
3,Partners,"It was ok, I have read many of her novels, this is not one of my favorites, but it was somewhat entertaining."
2,A long tedious tale,"starting up with some interest - the story flags - and finally ends on a disappointing and uneasy note.Readers are left wondering what exactly was the pint of the plot, and why ever time should be spent so wastefully.Such a disappointment, since most of the books by Nora Roberts provide such entertaining stories and with a gripping plot-line."
4,good flow,for a change of pace from my usual genre it was very interesting and was hard to put down to do my chores
5,Trusted author,"Can always depend on Nora for a good read, she did not disappoint this time. Keep them coming. It's not unlike me to go back for a second read of her books."
3,Good enough,I didnt know really what to expect with this .. I am so glad I picked it up. Much more adult than her other stuff and really entertaining. Buying the rest of her books!
2,An early book.,"You could tell this was one of Nora Roberts first books. It was okay, but not up to her high standard."
4,Partners by Nora Roberts,"Excellent reading! Like the older writings....Nora kept it just ""out of reach"" in figuring it all out..totally enjoyed it. A good read."
4,awsom,If you are thinking of trying out this book you can't go wrong in my opinion this is one of Nora Roberts better books.
5,Quality television at it's finest,"Old Nickelodeon was the best thing that ever hit TV. Of course life has to move on, but I really wish they had a channel that would play episodes from old nickelodeon. This series is very funny and adventuresome. The beginning song will stay in your head forever and I feel myself to always having to say ""It's I hope we never part, now get it right or pay the price"". Anyways, shows like this are very good and if you grew up in the 90's you will love them."
3,"Cute, but too small for age range","We got this bike for our godson's 3rd b-day. Says up to age 4 so we knew he wouldn't have more than a year of riding it before it got too small, but it was so cute we figured it would be worth it for a year. However, we felt so bad after we gave it to him because we had to take it back! We raised the seat completely and raised the handlebars and his legs were still very bent. When testing out a bike, the rider should be able to fully extend his leg to the lower petal. Not only would we not get a year out of it, we was already too big. He is slightly taller than the average 3 year old, but not huge. Also, when assembling the bike, the # plate broke off, the toggle for the sound broke off (but still worked) and the back tire was flat. We returned this and Amazon was fantastic. They sent us a return shipping label and agreed to pay for the return. So no problems with Amazon, but not a big fan of the bike. The larger one seemed OK, but just looked too big."
1,Just a BAD idea.,"This book is literally dangerous. The author describes various people with serious, potentially LIFE-THREATENING illnesses and goes on to say how they were taken off all of their medication and miraculously *healed* with all sorts of non-FDA-approved and non-regulated nonsense herbs, supplements, and potions. It might sound like it offers hope to those that wish to stay away from modern medicine, but you know what? 50 years ago, you had five years to live (maybe) after a diagnosis of lupus - these days, because of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, many lupus patients can live a full, long life (20, 30, 40 years!) - real medication is how you treat real illnesses, and this book is extremely dangerous in its attempt to convince seriously ill people that they can be just fine if they snub western meds. Instead, they're likely to get extremely worse and possibly die. What a horrible book!"
5,A terrific book,"The Taming of Corky was a really suspenseful story.Once you start reading it you can't stop till you finish the book. When you read it you feel like it is really true, and should come alive. Jan wanted a baby so much that she kept trying to ""tame"" Corky. When she finally ""tames"" him she feels like a dream has come true. She hopes that Corky has no relatives, so they can keep him. Read the book to find out if Corky has relatives or not.READ...READ!"
2,Terrible Game!,This game has bad graphics and sounds. The colors are very dull and the music can drive you crazy! Other than that you have 3-on-3 basketball action that is very unrealistic. Players can jump very high and do impossible dunks and other moves. I recommend getting NBA Showtime instead.
2,This Game is Just Bad!!!!!,"The background music will make you want to slam your head into the wall! The players flicker a great deal while moving up and down the court. You can even see through them as they become transparent when the action is too intense. You just don't get the same feeling in this game as you did with NBA Jam! Overall, this game is an example of a good series gone horribly wrong! Bad graphics, music, and repetitive gameplay make this game a waste of your money!"
5,The Best,"NBA Hoopz is a good game for 5 yrs or older. It has great action. It is 3 on 3 basketball. You pick a forward, guard and center from any team. You can change players between quarters. It is the best game that I have."
3,Brilliant!!!!!! NOT.,"I really liked the first volume of this joint project by Norton and Edghill. The combo of a Regency Romance and an alternate world was delightful. This effort, however, is rather leaden, poorly planned and jerky. There are fewer 'real history' cameos (outside of DeSade and Lafitte who are major characters.) The likelihood of a Duchess running off to the new world, no husband, no retinue...and no recognition when she gets there is a major stretch. The whole grail ""quest"" is silly, particularly Merel's survival in the wilderness! The Duke's angst is getting overdone - particularly his fear of assasination by his own people. A Duke?...really, now. I hope the series returns to Europe and to court intrigue and magic."
3,"Good, but....","I read this a few years after reading ""How soccer explains the world"", so my comparison is based on a shaky memory, with lots of other soccer reading in between....In some ways, SATE a more interesting read - you can really feel that the author knows soccer much more intimately than Foer (HSETW author) does. And the writing is a little less 'clinical' than the other book, and the extra chapter is nice. But while this book is a series of anecdotes that are entertaining, I thought Foer does a better job making the point implicit in the title.And the clumsy translation is ridiculous - it's as if the publishers just performed a ""search and replace"" for ""football"" and ""soccer"" - to the point where it's at times confusing: sections about ""American soccer"" where clearly he meant American Football (=gridiron). I know it's not Shakespeare, but I'd rather read the ""real thing""."
3,Respectable,"As a long time Colvin fan, I am interested in anything she records. ""A Whole New You"" is more low key than some of her earlier works, but I find myself remembering the melodies and lyrics hours after I have turned off the CD player. Somehow, this low key CD has infiltrated my brain. I agree with some of the other reviewers who comment that Colvin's remarkable guitar playing is lost amidst the production. While not her best, this CD is still a respectable effort from an artist worth following."
3,Life (and artists) have their ups and downs...,"While I absolutely love Shawn Colvin, however, I don't think that this offering measures up to her best. In my opinion, she (as well as Joni Mitchell,) are the best singer/songwriters in the world, who just happen to be female. Although there are some strong songs and performances on the CD, they come early on - and it finishes rather limp. The CD just doesn't hang together, as a total work. Like I said, artists have their ups and downs, just like everybody else... While this is not her most cohesive collection of songs, I'm still glad I purchased it, because the good songs certainly make up for the weak."
2,Whole New Low,"Wow ... was I excited about the prospect of a new Shawn Colvin album. I still listen regularly to the smash ""A Few Small Repairs"" so couldn't wait to rip-off the shrink wrap and have a listen. ... A slick, over-produced effort was what greeted my ears. I yawned all the way through it .. the melodies, such as they are, meander and the lyrics are trite. I searched, in vain, for some catchy pop hooks to capture my interest, but there were none to be had. The quick fix is to lose John Levanthal .. let him grab onto someone else's coattails. And the cover art? Truly bizarre. What could she be thinking?"
1,If only we had a negative number of stars...,"This book isn't funny. It's extremely negative to a level that I didn't think possible for children's books. Truly, I saw it at the library, couldn't bear to read the entire thing, then came to give it a bad review....it's really that bad.If your child is having a hard time adjusting to a new pregnancy or new sibling, deal with their actual emotions. Do not give them the idea that throwing mommy away is an option."
4,Blue and Red sides,I had a old pair of these before they were stolen. these are good ear phones. I went through 3 pairs for $39.99 head phones that lasted only 6 weeks at a time (skull candys) Those are some trash. But These are really good. If you get a clip or 2 for the wire you can run with these easy. Or get a cheap pair for work outs so you don't ruin the good pair. I am giving these 4 stars and not 5 because. They changed the blue tip and red tip to all black. and the stock ends are gray not white but I think I can order the white ones no biggie. Other then that THESE are GREAT. 2 year warrenty. SWEET.
3,ER-4P versatility,"The ER-4P earphones definitely deliver great sound. I can hear things in music that I can't from other headphones I've tried. I listen to a range of music, from Classical, Jazz, pop to hip-hop. This degree of sound doesn't come cheap, but for me it did have some drawbacks.I wanted an all-in-one set of earphones, that I could get my money's worth out of. But unfortunately these could not do that. These types of headphones rely on a seal in the ear canal, and at the gym, this seal can be broken. Sometimes, it's sweat, sometimes from bodily movement, and sometimes from just pressure in the head during heavy lifting (bench).If this review was based purely on sound, it would have received 5 stars, but because it was not as versatile as I wanted it to be, I had to give it 3 stars.For the gym, I've had to go back to earphones that do not rely on a seal."
2,Just go get the Shure E3,"I had owned Shure E3s, but lost them. This time I decided to try Etymotic's competing earphones, the ER-4P. Bad Idea. Sure, the sound is good, but it's good on the E3s as well. However, Shure has a number of great ideas that Etymotic missed out on. Their earphones conform around the ear, not stick out making you look like an idiot. When wearing the Etymotics I scream ""I'm a fool with wierd headphones, someone mug me for my ipod"". With the Shure's no one even noticed I had headphones on. The big difference is excess noise. The Shure's fit snugly around the back of your head. When the cable is bumped, the sound travels to the snug point and dies, never reaching your ears. The Etymotic cables just dangle. Everytime you turn your head the cables bump your shirt collar, and loud vibrations offend your ear drums.I tried each for six months. Now I'm selling the Etymotics and buying another pair of Shure's. They're both the same price, go buy the E3."
5,Amazing Headphones,"These earphones are absolutely phenomenal! Every sound is clear and well balanced, just like the artist intended. I've ownedBose In-Ear Headphonesbefore. They had a little bit more bass than these, but the clarity on these earphones is better than with the Bose. Also, the sound isolation is amazing. These earphones block out a ton of ambient noise. Put them in and try clapping. It's amazing how much of the clap is blocked out. This sound isolations leads me to my only complaint: The amount of noise that travels through the cord. Because it's a sealed in-ear type the vibrations go right through the cord and into your ear. They are best used when you're holding still or where the cord is able to hang away from your body."
2,OK...not worth the cost,"Not certain insertion of the earpieces is 'healthy' for the middle ear canal without cleaning after each use. Certain most users will not do this. Also, certain that earplugs costing 1/4 would boast same quality. Money not an issue with me...quality is although. Had to alter equalizer settings on both ends to get a semi audiophile output. OK for an IPod I guess... TT"
5,Teen Angst To The Max,Aimee is a stunning look at teen angst and the real problems that face young adults even as they are trivialized by their parents. The narrator's voice is strong and frighteningly real. One can't help but feel that the author must have firsthand experience of what it's like to be the survivor of a best friend's suicide. The descriptions and scene settings are vivid and true. Bravo to Mary Beth Miller for giving us teen characters that are so purely portrayed.
5,The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Second Season,Great old fashioned comedy and old fashioned values. Head and shoulders above the garbage sitcoms aired these days
5,Another Great Release,"I just finished watching the last episode in this series and what a treat. Excellent quality and the added commercials that were tied to episode was a nice treat. I am anxiously awaiting the release of season 3. I could not quite understand why the bumbling, awful Deputy Warren was pictured on one of the disc's table of contents. Thankfully he was not a part of these first 5 seasons."
4,"ANDY GRIFFITHS SHOW, SEASONS 1 & 2","It has been a very pleasant experience watching the first two seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. The comedy tends to focus on the foibles of humanity, and has at times broke me up into guffaws of laughter. Don Knotts is simply priceless as the bombastic, bumbling Barney Fife, and Andy Griffiths provides an apt 'straight man'to his antics. In short, the initial three seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITHS SHOW provide good, innocent humour in the setting of small town North America which was so prevalent in the early 1960's. As for the seasons after #3, I personally will be taking a pass, since I recall them as a gallery featuring rural rubes such as ""Gomer Pyle"" & ""Guber"", who serve as the butt of laughter at their odd personalities."
2,It's Not the same !,"I have been using Herbalifes Niteworks Lemon for years, this is the first time I have purchased it through Amazon and It was not the same! It didn't smell or taste the same as what I am use to from Herbalife . I'm not sure what they did but I will never buy it again anywhere els but through Herbalife. Thanks for asking"
2,Did Nothing For Me,"I have been told Niteworks is a super effective natural stimulant that is better and healthier than caffeine or drugs and general doping. I have no doubt that it's healthier. However, the product did nothing for me. I felt exactly the same after as I did before, and I used it for several days. It is very possible that the product combines with an individual's chemistry to create results, and that my chemistry just wasn't optimum. I am giving Herbalife the benefit of the doubt here. It is also possible that this a can of super expensive placebo powder."
4,Mine is fine.,"This monitor has sharp, crisp images. There is no glare to speak of. It is easy to hook up. The only problem I have with it is it's too small."
5,DO KIDS 2DAY KNOW WHERE THE SLIME CAME FROM?,"Do the kids of today even know where green slime came from? It came from a WONDERFUL show called ""You Can't Do That on Television!"" This was a classic show and dealt with the ""hot"" topics of the 80's -- peer pressure(remember when they dropped the pier on Kevin Schenk's foot?), soap opera addiction (Lisa Ruddy glued to her tv set)and hard work (Moose shoveling a pile of dirt and her dad even came to help her!). If you're a true fan, you know which episodes I'm talking about! PLEASE NICK, give us this show on DVD!! THE WORLD NEEDS TO LAUGH AGAIN!!!"
1,help my printer is evil,"I bought the printer a year and a half ago and it has never worked for printing. It scans fine though. So in short its a pretty expensive scanner. I haven't tried to fax yet, i'm too scared. It absolutely will not print in black ink, and I will not pay more money to buy the entire ink cartridge. I think i will just buy a new printer instead. I am very unhappy with this printer, and have no way of getting it fixed properly. I have reinstalled the software more than 10 times, and my computer still fails to recognize it on occasion, leaving me to uninstall reinstall all over again. I absolutely do not recommend buying this printer."
1,VHS should be provided in Hindi,"I hav not seen this film but as far as our job is concerned this VHS can be used in the community such as slums, low income and literate people. We are working for the prevention of HIV/AIDS for this matter we conduct group meeting, video shows to disseminate information easily & people get interested through different method. Can you do it in local language"
3,In The Latin Mood but not Dream Dancing,I happen to like brass but when applied to Drean dancing many would say that the brass needs to be less up front and more mellow. Nevertheless this is a very pleasant album. It in no way comes up to the standard of the first two Capitol albums which were beautifully balanced. Worth having though.
5,Cutler & Netrebko at their best,"Buy it...it is beautifulOnly note...Amazon says that Renee Fleming is ""in"" this production...and she is, but only as an interviewer at the intermissions with Anna."
5,Outstanding performance,"Bellini: I PuritaniI liked this production since the first time that I saw it on PBS, even though it took a while to buy it.I found the cast very good mainly the principal characters:Elvira played by Anna Netrebko was very convincing, her transformation when She thought that her fiancé was running away with somebody else and performance the ""mad scene"" singing and effortless acting when she dropped to the floor in a frenzy attack continuing singing , at the end she showed her happiness when he returned and married her.Eric Cutler played Elvira's fiancé very well done having a wonderful voice for this role.John Relyea who I have seen playing other characters in other operas was very good in this role showing his love and concern for her sister.The scenery, choreography and costumes were very successful, as well as the orchestra and direction were outstanding.This is a beautiful performance and the quality of this DVD is great, in my opinion deserves 5 stars."
2,I don't think so . . .,"This is a book for a romance novel reader, not for a true Jane Austen afficionado. The first half is all sex and the seemy brutality of the period while the second half is all Darcy chasing across France after his sister. In all of Jane Austen's books, the action is of the drawing room, ballroom, and formal gardens. Other events (seductions, pregnancy, birth, illegitimacy abandonment, duels, death) are merely mentioned. Elizabeth is a dope, Jane is a dupe, Bingly is a dud, and Darcy is dull. Who really wants to envision Darcy sitting on his bed and peeing into a chamber pot while Elizabeth looks on admiringly?"
1,"The Bar Sinister, Pride and Prejudice Continues","I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't even bother to finish it and will be giving my copy away. I tired very quickly of the sexual aspects of the novel...if I wanted that I would have gotten a Harlequin romance instead. I prefer the way Jane Austen built up gradually to the romance... I do not think that Jane Austen would have written like this if she were a contemporary novelist. A much better choice for those who can't get enough of Darcy is An Assembly Such as This: Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman by Pamela Aidan."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is a trashy romance novel trying to be a classic. I was very disappointed in the sex, sex and more sex happening throughout the novel. I'm certainly not a prud, but a book that advertises itself as a sequel to a classic, well written and modest story, to find so much sexual suggestion and description was a sincere let down. For those who enjoyed the suggestion of sexual tension in JA novels, this is not a book for you."
4,Fun book to read,"Much better than other sequels. While the betwixts and connexions were hard to bear I couldn't put this book down. No, Jane Austen definitely didn't write this, but as a Darcy-Elizabeth fan I liked the fact that they were so violently in love. And what she did to Lady Catherine when the latter paid her last visit!!! What a hoot. I know some people are aghast at that and what Darcy did when he rescued his beloved, but what was he suppose to do---call 911?! I just had fun reading this... My only complaints being Darcy's old lover(s) and Wickham-- when will we finally see the end of this scoundrel!?"
1,Not worth the read,"I went into this book with relatively low expectations. I understand a modern author is unable to capture the same elegance and feeling as Austen, but this was beyond bad. The auther seemed to feel that putting ""Pray"" in front of a sentence would be enough of a language change. She didn't even seem to try to really duplicate the language of the other Austen books. She did things with the characters that Austen would NEVER have approved of. Her treatment of Bingley alone ruins the book. I was amazed that she could so badly interpret the personalities and characters of the original. The sex was rather explicit and graphic. I bought this book with the intent of sending it to my mother and sisters when I was done, but I refuse to send it to them and have told all of them never to read it. It's not worth the time."
3,Not Jane - But Entertaining All the Same,"This is the first sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I have read. As thick as the book is, I read it quickly. It moves and keeps you interested - on the whole - until we get to the Napoleonic War. This dragged on longer than I thought necessary. My largest complaint is the lack of editing and syntax. Lots of misspelled words or words missing altogether. The story jumped around which was confusing.I did like the devotion between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy. I am also certain they would have had a satisfying ...relationship. This book may have went a little too far in that area, however.It is not Jane Austen, but we all know that. Perhaps the spelling of names Elisabeth and Pemberly is done just to reinforce that point. This is a ""what if"" scenario. Overall it is entertaining and I do find myself going back and re-reading certain parts. Just as I do with Pride and Prejudice.In short, Jane Austen it isn't, but it is an entertaining read!"
5,What a Brilliant Book,"If you loved Pride & Prejudice and thought Mr Darcy and Elizabeth great, then you'll love this book. I had previously read an earlier sequel to Pride & Prejudice and had been totally disheartened at the lack of storyline, so it was with trepidation that I decided to buy and read this book. Linda Berdoll has depicted the Darcy marriage as everything I had imagined it to be and more. The only fault I found with this book was that it ended. Thank you Linda for bringing to life again such great characters that didn't disappoint."
3,Didn't fit right.,This belt was very uncomfortable. I did not feel any relief in my back. It has been returned.
4,green eggs and ham,I never received horton hears a who and it was never sent but acct was credited. I really wanted the dvd.
1,Broke during second use,One of the flippers broke on the flipper soccer game the second time we used it...it was a Christmas gift from Santa for my son and quite disappointing!
3,ok,"What can you expect for the price. Me and my daughter have played with it some, its ok, it is what it is."
2,surprise!,"A close look at the colorful ad shows 1/72. That is the scale ratio, so most of the figures are 1 in. tall. The color of everything is brown - painting will be quite a challenge. Had wished for a visual aid for teaching, but this isn't it."
1,Worst piece of crap ever!,"I was extremely disappointed with the Lewis & Clark Expedition kit. I called the company to ask about the size as I wanted it for my son's school project. I was assured it was large enough for painting and I stupidly thought they meant large enough for a human to paint. The figures are soooooo small I think Tinkerbell would have a problem maneuvering a brush to paint the ALREADY brown colored figures. A total waste of money; the only reason I didn't send it back was it would cost more money to ship it back than the refund I would get. Total waste, unless you are a fairy or a borrower, don't bother with this crap."
5,"Sweet, Sweet Summerland","Summerland had a fresh and sometimes heart warming feeling and cast. Teens everywhere loved this television show and still continue to even though it is off the air. The cast gave an enthusiastic effort to make the episodes come to life. They completed that task all together and produces a superb show. With a young cast, many people could relate to the situations happening as well as the problems many characters went through. With some characters in high school, middle school, and trying to get jobs, Summerland was just like people's real life now. Summerland should come to DVD and VHS for many people to enjoy the show even more. Also, new episodes could be made, but still does not need to go back on TV. Instead, the new episodes could be sold on DVD and VHS. Summerland touched many people's lives, and should come back to continue to do the same."
5,holly ( England),"I loved summerland while it was on tv! i wached very episode. I am quite dissaponted it has finished! i will definaitly be buying the dvd as soon as it comes out! i only think people didnt watch the show as people can only watch it if they have sky,if it was on a diffrent chanel that all viewers recive I think the show would of been alot more popular with younger people. Out of all the people at my school in England i only knew one other person who wached the show wich is quite dissapointing as its such a good programme.XxX xoxhollyx0x who agreez with meee???:D:D:D"
5,Awesome Show,This is pretty much my all time fav TV Show I can't believe they cancelled this show but i wanna know if they're ever gonna come out DVDs
4,"Almost, but not quite...","The first track is an explaination of how to use the second, nothing terribly unusual. The second track is a guided imagery relaxation and self-esteem exercise. I found Ms. Rose's voice, pacing, inflection, and progression very relaxing and easy to use - except for some phrasing and word choice that was jarring to my ears; ""valley girl"" speak if you will. This sounds so out of place on this CD that it could limit it's usefulness to you if it bothers you as it does me. I would gladly buy a CD by Ms. Rose that was more carefully scripted."
2,Not that great,"Some parts of this CD are good, but others are annoying.I don't care for Melissa's voice, but perhaps this is a personal issue. In addition, there is a particular ""guided visualization"" in this CD that I find especially grating - ""see yourself hitting the homerun, everyone is cheering you, you can do it"" and ""See yourself playing with a puppy and smelling it's litte puppy breath"" Seeing myself hit a homerun in grade school is not going to further me along my path, sorry. My recommendation: ""See yourself purchasing a better guided Visualization CD."""
2,not what i expected,"i agree w/the other reviewers in that her voice is very relaxing, but i thought the cd would be more about affirmations and she was going on about some healing ray of light and this other bologna. not worth half the money you pay for it. i plan on immediately trading it in at sam goodys."
1,"If you know yoga, this isn't it","It really is all over the place; maybe if you don't know anything about yoga it's a good stretching exercise video, but if you were looking for a good flow or anything that's cohesive this really isn't it."
2,"Fast Delivery, sturdy walker, defected wheel","The rollator arrived faster than expected - ordered on Saturday, arrived on Monday. It was easy to assemble without even reading the manual. However, the walker is defected - the front-left brake was built too close to the wheel that the wheel was not even moving. We tried to adjust it but nothing have worked. Had to return the item immediately because it's in urgent need."
4,Works great.!,Great fins... the only thing that sucks is that u can't adjust the size... but if they fit you then ure good to go!
2,Do Chinese have small feet?,"I have had very good experience with US Divers' products in the past.I don't know how significant it is that these fins are the first I have owned that fit like shoes rather than by a strap behind the heel. However that may be, the X-Large fins are advertised for mens' sizes 10-13. My size is 12, so I felt safe being right in the middle.Getting these suckers on is an incredible struggle. I cannot believe how hard it is and I regret the purchase. When I finally get them on, they work OK, although they do not have as much power as my previous US Divers' fins. But when I take them off, I have marks showing me my feet have been stressed by the fit.One of my grandsons is size 13. He can barely get his toes in.Beware."
3,US Diver Fins,Good inexpensive fins. They could be a little stiffer but good all around fins for the price.
2,If I hear Butterfly one more time....,"This is so annoying. The song and lyrics are good, but Crazy Town wrecked it with their annoying voices. And then the radio got hold of it, and it played it 10 times in 1 hour and it annoyed the heck out of me. It got so boring. Every time it came on, I just switched the station (although there was no station that wasn't playing this song, so I turned my radio off altogether.) I mean, after a few months you'd think this would be all played out and they'd quit playing it, but not this. If that many people like Butterfly, just buy it. I just wish they'd get over Butterfly and start playing what IS ""Today's Hit Music"" because this is turning into yesterday's, and the people who don't like this song (i.e., me) are getting sick of the radio."
3,Crawford in Full Control,"The play ""Craig's Wife""(title of an earlier movie version with Roz Russell) may have been a daring-for-its-day look at a phenomenon of Depression-era America's upwardly-mobile middle class: the empty shell of a woman for whom position and appearance mean everything. (Mary Tyler Moore played an updated version in ""Ordinary People."") But when Crawford the control-freak assumed the role, it took on grotesque dimensions -- down to her 1950 hairdo that looks like an Oreo with a bite out of it. This is one role Crawford played that must have been completely natural to her -- the narcissistic despot of ""Mommie Dearest."" (And with tired old Wendell Corey as her spouse and foil, she steals every scene.) Still, it's fun to watch this cool schemer get her comeuppance -- but, when she regally ascends her spiral staircase in the last shot, alone among the splendor of her possessions, you wonder who has won after all."
3,"Not bad, but the size is a bit odd","the dress itself is very nice, even though it's very ""nylonish"".I had an issue with the size (I'm 5'7 and 155p): cap is too small, arm gauntlets are too tight, the dress itself is too big in chest (mine is 36C). you need to be at least 36E or DD to make a good fit.the corset part of the dress (I guess due to the lack of bubs) was sitting ""chubby"" on me.but, if you can manage with the size, the costume is quite good."
1,Among the worst kits I have attempted to put together,"Typical AMT fit and finish. Hardly any of the parts fit correctly. There is flash everywhere. The door seams on the driver side is too shallow, so you have to take a knife and make it deeper. This kit is bad even for AMT/ERTL."
2,substitute soy,"I bought the book because of all the great reviews. I was disapointed to find that a lot of recipes used soy substitutes, vegan cheese alternatives, vegan sour cream alternative and silken tofu.Not many pictures. The pictures that do appear on the pages, do not correspond with the recipe on the opposite page.It is a very basic book.Not very creative."
4,Some tasty stuff,"The spinach lasagna is KILLER, and I make several of the appetizers on a regular basis for my omnivore friends and family. Desserts are so-so. Several recipes call for vegan cheese, which I am not fond of."
5,Great Book,"Nice cover, good size and colorful pages. Children will enjoy this book. The illustrations are great for children to understand the story."
4,"Good compromise, great debut","Firstly sorry for my english,I'm Italian.The guy who made comparison with Creed was probably exaggerating, but he didn't miss totally the point. There are surely grunge elements (Nirvana,Bush) in this record even if the majority of songs sound basically emo. There is a little resemblance with Quicksand too; but this one has a lot better production (It sounds very clean, Quicksand records were really lo-fi). Apart from all that, this Rival schools debut is very good, and has the rare merit to be neither too mainstream or alternative. It's in the middle, very melodic and powerful. Maybe At the drive-in (somebody here mentioned them) were of a different class, but in any case this one could be in everyone's ""best of 2001"" list."
5,Need new music? Buy this CD.,"I'm not going to label this music. Some songs are fast, some are slow. They'll all be stuck in your head for days. You'll find yourself wanting to listen to them over and over. There are very intricate guitar parts/sounds throughout the CD. I like to listen to it with headphones on, and I'm constantly picking out new sounds I hadn't noticed before. Walter's voice and singing style compliments the music beautifully. I like the way the vocals are mixed. Sammy's drumming ties it all together in the best way possible.Rival Schools bridge the 1990's to the 2000's better than any other band I can think of. You need to buy United By Fate right now! You should also try and catch them live next time they play yer town."
2,Quicksand-lite,"Walter Schreifels has abandoned the metal/post-hardcore hybrid Quicksand pioneered in favor of heartfelt ballads and mid-tempo alternative rock. His latest project, Rival Schools, has more in common with limp-wristed emo kids Jimmy Eat World than with peers such as Jawbox or Helmet. If you like your music sanitized, weepy and bland, then ""United By Fate"" should provide a satisfying listening experience."
3,Everything Has Its Point,"This isn't a bad album, by any means. Rival Schools' strengths here are the dynamic songs like 'Travel By Telephone' and 'Used For Glue'. What makes this album less-than-outstanding is an abundance of songs with monotonous dynamics and wandering, distracted-sounding melodies [such as 'Undercovers On'].A previous reviewer has described this as ""the most mediocre album ever."" That's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's not all that far off the mark.I don't regret buying a used copy."
1,Waste your money elsewhere,"Those of you who think this is the next evolutionary step for Quicksand listen to too much Creed. This album is just plain bad, and for that reason alone it surprises me that I haven't heard it on the radio. Rival Schools sounds like everyone else that is trying so hard to sell records that they became oblivious to the concept of writing decent songs."
3,Broan 413004 Range Hood,The product was easy too install with the help of one other person.The only thing I found wrong with it was the fan...I think is not strong enough to pull the smoke up. Otherwise it looks great.
4,fan is not strong,"HELLO...I BOUGHT THIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR A NUTONE THAT THE FAN BURNT OUT..THIS UNIT ARRIVED VERY FAST, DOUBLE BOXED, NO DAMAGE,INSTALLED SMOOTHLY, HOLDS ONE BULB EVEN A CFL..TURNED ON EXHUST FAN AND TOOK AN OPENED NAPKIN PLACED IT NEAR FILTER AND IT WAS NOT SUCKED OUT OF MY HAND, BUT IT DID STAY ON THE FILTER WHEN I GOT 1 INCH AWAY...NEXT TIME I GET ONE WITH HIGH CFM AND MAYBE NEXT TIME I WILL TRY A STAINLESS STEEL ONE."
5,A great value.,"This range hood is a great value. It comes well packaged and installation is a breeze. The light is placed well in my opinion for adding brightness to the stove top without glaring into your eyes. The fan is much quieter than the old Nu-tone which was being replaced. High speed on this unit made about the same amount of noise as low speed did on the old unit. The fan itself is effective (especially) at high speed for drawing air away from the stove top and up through the included filter. The filter type is the Broan #41F Range Hood Filter. The filter is easily accessed and removed for quick replacement.The hood attaches with 4 screws which are included. For making the electrical connection, I simply re-purposed a power cord from an old table lamp that had outlasted it's usefulness. Installation time was about 10 minutes and required nothing more than 2 wire nuts (not included) and a screwdriver."
4,Stunning Bargain,Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hood. Great Bargain! Price is very reasonable; the quality is the same as higher priced product. A definite good buy!!!
4,More than a Flock Of Seagulls Cover,"NY synthpop cause celebre' Count To Infinity is best known for this cover version of the new wave classic. But his talent as a musician shines through in his 'own' tracks, combining trance and house elements with a breathy vocal style. I would say start with the cover, chances are you will like what he's done with the song, and from there, get his excellent newest album 'exploding plastic inevitable'."
5,Cowboys Plate,"The License Plate was delivered as expected, it looks wonderful. I was pleasantly surprised from the weight very stout. The item arrived in perfect condition and on time.Thank You"
4,Trilene line,"I like Trilene lines because they are strong and perfectly priced, other high price lines are over rated and wasted of money."
4,GREAT SONGS!! PETULA CLARK IS GREAT IN THIS PART!!,"I totally disagree with any comment about the songs in this film being forgettable. They are wonderful! Petula Clark does an amazing singing job as well as acting. And, although Peter O'Toole is not a singer, I don't think an English Professor would have a great voice anyway. The songs themselves stand by themselves. Who could forget the great song ""London Is London"", ""Walk Through The World With Me"" or ""You And I"". They're great, and I, being a singer, sing these songs all the time. The cinemetography is superb. (It is worth noting that the original concept of making ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" a musical was conceived by Dory and André Previn [""Inside Daisy Clover"" and ""Valley Of The Dolls""], but I guess the ""powers that be"" really disliked Dory Previn's lyrics and they were both released from the project, being replaced, of course, by Leslie Bricusse). I highly recommend this film!!"
5,Superb,"I have had this book for many years and have read and reread it a number of times. To me it is superb, if rather disturbing, and is one of my favorite novels of all time. (You can see other reviews here for a plot synopsis, so I will skip that.)One thing none of the other reviewers have picked up on is the humour in this book. Some of the scenes are achingly funny in a tragic way, for example Christmas Day with the girlfriend's family in Walton-upon-Thames, a suburb of London, or the character sketches of some of the teachers at the school in Nyasaland, or the failed seduction by an older woman.I think some of the negative reviews here may be reacting to the sexual frankness of the narrative.Anyway, highly recommended by me."
4,Interesting semi-autobigraphical (??) account of life,"Finally examines the ultimately therapeutic relationship Theroux finds in writing itself as a way to save him from his own romantic immaturity, hypocrisy and later self-indulgence.The real teaser here is exactly how close to his actual life the book is. It would be interesting to find books about himby others to make a decision. Well written and entertaining as usual, this bookdelivers on the jacket note claims and critical quotes."
1,How dissatisfied I am with the new style of people,I think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones.
2,SAME PER SON (DARCY),"Oh, yeah , & what's up w/the hole in the green part of the thing?????????? is that like, so if they jump 2 high, they don't hit their heads or what??? Darcy"
3,Amazing,This CD is a triumph. It is a magificent example of what comes from this region of France. Canut sings with a fire and a passion.It is a must have for those who are interested in the Gipsy Kings and the music from their part of the world.
1,"Not under 13, but this product is terrible.","For the love of God, do not buy this printer. I have nearly broken my knuckles several times after taking out my frusterations upon it. This thing only prints when it feels like it, or else the paper will get jammed. Sometimes it'll take 10 sheets of paper in at a time. It's just un-reliable and I just wanted to save you all the trouble of buying this multifunction piece of non-printing trash. Thank you."
1,Missing voice track for Season 1 episode 12,"While I love Stargate SG1 and enjoy all the episodes, there is a problem with the 3rd disk from season 1. One of the voice tracks is missing in episode 12 ""The Nox"". I have had this same problem with 3 different disks and each time I tried to replace it the new one had the same issue. I would love to know if the company has corrected this problem and how I could get a corrected disk."
4,Good Start,"I enjoyed this first episode. I thought that the plot was easy to follow. If I were to add anything to this episode, I would have made Ponch meaner and Larry Wilcox's character less goody two shoes."
5,CHiPs release date set!,"CHiPs Season 1 will be released by Warner Brothers on June 5, 2007. All 22 Season 1 episodes will be included on 6 discs. About time! If you're a fan, buy it so that more seasons will be released. Seasons 1-3 of Emergency! have been released due to demand."
5,Still good after all these years,"If you're craving some 70s cheese, this is the show to watch!The episodes are still fun to watch, the characters are interesting, and it's a great lesson in pop culture of the era.I haven't listened to any with commentary by Erik Estrada, but I'm sure that will only add to the cheesy goodness."
1,Great Iron for the first 6 months....,"...and after that - the soleplate gets mucked up to the point of having to clean it after every ironing making it a chore.Then, barely 12 months into it's life - it broke!The iron does not heat up.I have written to T-Fal and they can replace it (for the price of a new one!)I will try one of the cheaper brands - At least after a year I can throw it away with less stress..."
3,Go Dallas....,"We were impressive when we received the our Dallas travel mug. But after a couple washes...the metal logo, cameoff the mug...we then bought glue and glued it back on."
3,Looks Good,I got this for my husband - I figured he might not leave this one behind if it was Dallas on it. He was thrilled! While it keeps things warm and contained(if up right). He did say if it tipped over - it would leak - not a good thing.
5,great stuff!,i bought this product because my instructor is in it on the USA/kajukembo part i loved this series and i hope they continue it. it's nice to see things in a positive light for martial artists
1,Nearly as bad as Bo Derek's Tarzan-Addendum,"An addendum to my prior review: Yes, there are elements of the movie that hearken back to the ERB novels (I have read most of them). Regardless, that alone does not make this film worthwhile."
2,Not Enough Tor Johnson,John Carradine gives a great performance but the story is hard to swallow and there's not enough of Tor Johnson. Worth a look. Great opening credits!
4,I think it was great...,"I have this film and recommend it for anyone who wants to know what teens can go threw. So much of this was me. The denial of the parents, the love for someone in the closet, and fear and what it takes to make it threw what most can and will go threw or has. In more then one way this was me for a long time and only when I came out did it clear up but this definitely sums it up for the ""before"" events in my life. I recommend this to anyone, mainly parents etc that would like to know what I teen can really go threw in all of the years they have no choice but to wait."
2,Hopeless High School Jock Fantasy Comes To Screen,"There really is not a heck of a lot to praise about this movie. The plot could have been any third-rate teen 'romantic comedy' with a gay twist and of course, some melodrama. (""Oh Steven, I'm so scared!"") - the words of John Dixon, the jockboy fantasy of a more brain Steven Carter. Of course, it turns out John is gay and they have a secret affair. Throw in some more melodrama, some really cheesy gay jokes and failed attempts at 'sexual' scenes, and you have 'Get Real.' Not particularly funny, not particularly romantic, not particularly touching, and definitely not worth watching."
2,Run-of-the-mill Teenybopper Flick Turns Queer,"Dear Director: Get Real! Alright, this movie is probably not the worst one I have ever seen, but it insults your intelligence. Think of your typical bad American teenybopper flick with loads of C-grade acting, no storyline, plenty of pretty faces and some bad comedy, and add a gay twist. Essentially, quiet gay teen gets his fantasies come true when the star of the soccer team gets with him. The dramatic scenes make you feel like laughing out loud, especially the bad gay jokes. The only funny thing to see is Steven fall in love with every man he meets at the toilets. A saving grace is Charlotte Brittain as Linda, Steven's sidekick. Did I mention that Steven and John have no chemistry, to top everything off?"
3,"not here 2 agree to anybody's review, this is my own.","I am confused just as Jhonny is. This is the plot, the overall story that i would've wanted ""Beautiful Thing"" to have. However, Get Real, isn't that good afterall. This film has a really young vibe feel to it, it shows some great scenarios unlike BT that only develops either in Sandra's appartment and in a five-meter radius sarcastically. In a single word, Get Real is ""fresh"". The background music is just lovely, it's a very light kind of music and that helps a little bit. it feels as though you're being transported to the actual moment when it happened. the whole story is absolutely believable. i'd give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for Jhonny's poor acting and lack of chemestry with the movie as a whole, simply, he doesn't fit at all. i suppose some casting crew members are into greek guys, dunno why."
2,Rather disappointing,"I seem to be in the minority here--Most everyone else who reviewed this film absolutly loved it. I personally found the story...rather tedious. It is a classic example of a movie that should have been good but wasn't. I found the main character nearly impossible to like. I mean I sympathize with him to an extent in that he can't be with the person he loves, but that is no excuse to act like a little jerk to everyone. He spends the entire movie with a very put upon, the-world-hates-me-so-I-hate-the-world attitude and is generally very unpleasant to everyone in a ten block radius. When he's not having sex with strange men in public toilets that is. My overall recommendation about this film...don't waste your time."
5,Great for the Whole Family,"I have just finished watching this film with some friends. I must say this was an impressive and well done film. I agree with the other reviewers; acting was great, writing is excellent, everything is well timed, and it touches on many important gay issues. Let me add that the romantic scenes bewtween the leads were tastefully done and won't embarrass mom and dad. Best friend Linda is hilarious and fits right in the film. Through this film, everyone can see that it's normal to be gay, and that there's a reason those men meet in parks. It's not because they are perverted and sick. As a gay person, I could identify with pretty much every scene, the discomfort dealing with the parents, the longing for a relationship, the need to hide absolutely everything about this part of myself from the world for fear of reprisal. It's all in this wonderfully complete and well organized film. I encourage everyone, regardless of sexual orientation to see this film!"
4,"a very nice ""coming out"" film by Simon Shore","This small, but lovely, little film is well above average in its telling. It avoids cliche and compels one to really care what happens to these characters. The performances are nothing short of beautiful - particularly the one turned in by Ben Silverstone as Steve. All of the actors in this film exhibit such a quiet elegance and skill that it would be worth a watch on that issue alone. There's a lot more to it than that, though, and I'm looking forward to seeing more work from this talented director, Simon Shore, who obviously has a gift for cinema story telling. This is a wonderfully dignified little film!"
4,A love story with heart and soul,"GET REAL(UK - 1998)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SRA gay teenager finds love in the arms of the school jock, but social pressures frustrate their budding romance.A feel-good movie for gay teenagers (and their parents) everywhere! Bright narrative, instantly likeable characters, and a neatly-observed study of a relationship forged under extreme circumstances, this charming movie balances its dramatic momentum with plenty of comic asides, though the narrative has been stripped of the political dimension which informed the stage play on which it's based. Older cynics may groan at some of the more obvious material, but younger viewers will be enchanted. An unqualified success!"
1,"If you like good sound, save your money","I had high hopes for this record, but the sad fact is this disc is harsh and unlistenable.It's a shame because the music and performances are so good. I guess the engineers don't believe in bass because it sounds so puny. What happened here? Have the volume wars finally infiltrated the jazz world? This is truly an assault to the ears. Another casualty of the digital music age, I suppose."
2,like LBJ's view of Bill Fulbright,"In 600-plus pages that mention nothing about the history of Israel or the wars against Israel, and ignore anti-semitis=im in discussing the Dreyfus affair, the editors ignore the first five books of the Old Testatment in dismissing Judaism as a religion not concerned with reward and punishment, and print a map locating Jerusalem im some place called Palestine. In discussing ""Bibles"" never mention the illiterate committee that gave us the James, never refer to translations of the Hbrew work alone. Hard to say what other blindness, prejudice, and falsehood creeps into the tome. Asked about Bill Fulbright, LBJ compared him to a bucket of fresh milk squeezed staright from the cow after old Bessie whooshed her tail trough a cowpie and dropped it into the pail. anyone who wants to drink here should be wary."
5,Wonderfully witty and informative,"Though some may find the tongue-in-cheek presentation too light for a ""complete reference"", the authors have found a good mix of information and whimsy that gives you a chuckle or two while discovering just how many mathematical ""infinities"" there are and how many of them are worth more than a passing note to the common man. It is probably a good thing it is not more dry or complete, as the amount of material you can ingest between whiticisms seems very conducive to maximizing your basic (but usable) knowledge of many art and literary subjects we engineers missed in thermodymics classes and the practical physics missed by those who studied dead poets to earn their sheepskins."
5,A brilliant book,"This books is one of the best I've ever owned. My sister received the original edition back in the late 80's, and when she left for college I had to have my own copy. Of course, it's needs another update for some of the political science stuff, but the rest is still brilliant. And sure, it does tend to pat itself on the back a lot and over-simplify certain subjects (particularly in economics), but hey, if it interests you, go read more about it. It's supposed to inspire greater learning, not replace it."
3,A disappointment,"As someone looking for a concise ""adult's encyclopedia"", I found this extremely disappointing. The authors have organized the book sensibly and chosen the topics well, but they insist on utilizing a tongue-in cheek style that I didn't find amusing, and certainly isn't appropriate to a work characterized as a serious reference tool."
4,"Great Book , but some factual errors keep it from 5 stars","This is a useful book, although some sections are stronger than others. The entry on Islam in the 'religion' chapter mentions than Alexander the Great was a muslim. I'm wondering how this can be true almost 1000 years before Muhammad.Yes, the book lacks completeness, but, as has been pointed out many times, this was not the authors aim. This book is a well-written survey of topics that makes a fine reference"
1,Try something else,"There are a few good tips in this book--as well as some nicely selected readings to use for vocal variety. However, most of the content is familiar territory; very little of it covers new ground. It's a British book, as well, so perhaps it would feel more useful in the UK than it did to me in the US."
5,SHE IS UNIQUE...Ms.Barbra Streisand!!!!!!,"Well I've been a hardcore fan of Barbra for over three decades...She is superb...Her voice is just great....and I am very happy there is this new OUTING...TIMELESS...I live in Rio de Janeiro and I believe I'll never have a chance to see her in the flesh...Barbra if you ever read this, be sure of ONE thing! This new CD is splendid and thank you for enhancing my life with your singing, acting all these years.Don't ever stop making records and films...you bring joy, excellence into people's lives.I adore you.I wish you all the luck there is in this world."
3,where's the passion,"proud to be a life long adoring fan of babs, but listening to this cd i can only say, that whle i love it, there is a passion lackng in the deliverly of her songs that kept me spinning her earlier albums over and over again. only in ""on a clear day"" did she give me thoes oh so famuliar goose bumps. the songs are all so rigidly good and controlled, that i ache to hear her go out on a limb and sing once again like a passionate, hungry, boldly brilliant singer that she truely is. give up the controll babs--sing from your gut, rip out my emotions again. ps don't get the wrong impression here--i loved the cd--and i love you barbra!! david"
2,"DVD didn't play in several places, had to skip parts.","Love the movie, the DVD was just in poor shape..........had to skip several parts of the movie. It was almost unwatchable."
2,This is the keep case version,I specifically ordered the version that did not say it was the keep case package (there were separate listings) because I hate that type of case. It is flimsy and easily damaged in general. But I got the keep case anyway. I am very disappointed. Amazon often pulls this bait and switch type of description.
2,"His worst cd...try Live or Walk On, Perfectly Good Guitar","Of all his cd's this seems to me to be a rip-off. Lame versions of really good songs. Lifeless rendetions that will turn you away from one of my favorite artists. Stay clear and buy one of the others listed above, much better value."
3,Good Sampling But Not a Best Of,"Yes I know he's written a lot of tunes, but you can't have a ""Best of"" album without Ethylene, Georgia Rae, and possibly his best song Dust Down a Country Road.I have both albums that these songs are on ""Walk On"" and ""Slow Turning"" yet they don't appear on any of his ""greatest hits"" albums. If you are getting into John Hiatt for the first time, you must seek out those songs along with ""Shredding the Documents"".The album quality of sound is definitely very good though, and despite the absence of those previously mentioned four songs, this album IS a pretty good catch for someone just getting interested in John Hiatt.- I'm sitting on the toilette with my sunglasses on, wondering what you are up to..."
3,"Not his best, perhaps, but still worth reading.","I agree with some of the negative comments of others who comment on the book, that it's not his best, but there are still enough observations and turns of phrase that make you laugh out loud, to make it worth reading. I'm on the last 60 pages, now."
3,johhny and rick..,This is the only studio album made with rick derrenger.I like the songs but they need to remaster thissession so i give three stars...
4,Pretty and functional,"I ordered 12 of these, and then immediately went in for 12 more. I found them to be not only nice looking on my counter, but they are functional and easy to use as well. They stack nicely and aren't problematic to fill or use. So far they keep the moisture out just fine, but I haven't had them long, so we shall see. Some people have said that it's difficult to write on the labels, but a Sharpie does the trick just fine. Oh, and if you are thinking about getting these as extras to go along with the carousel, be aware that the lids look a bit different. They stack together just fine, but the lids on the jars for the carousel are somewhat translucent rather than opaque white like these are."
5,Fascinating tour of underground city infrastructure,"I love all of Macaulay's picture books. When my son (now 33) was a little boy we read them together (starting with the ""Unbuilding"" book) and I don't know who enjoyed them more. ""Underground"" is short but informative, with descriptions of the different underground utilities, how they function and why they are placed where they are. Of particular interest to me was the section on supports, piers and retaining walls. Do you know what a ""slurry wall"" is? David explains what and it is, why it is used and how it is constructed. A fascinating book if you or your child is interested in how things are built. Be sure to examine the drawings closely and you will find humorous artifacts buried within them."
2,"Boring, plain and dull","Some people say they sound like Depeche Mode or Camouflage and that they have a moody, dark synth pop sound. OK. There is anything like Depeche Mode here, only the singers voice who in a very succesful way sings like Dave Gahan. But who said that moody or dark synth pop has to be dull and plain? Depeche Mode may have some moody and dark songs but all of those songs have a good melody, that's why Depeche Mode is such a great band. Just think of this album like the worst moments of Camouflage. Many Camouflage songs sound to me like dull and boring songs too without any melodies but they have also very good songs. In this album there is no highlight, all the songs sound the same and they have a thing in common: lack of melodies. I couldn't even hear this album once I just quit it. Maybe if you hear this album from another perspective you could like it but with a reference like a Depeche Mode sound a like you will certainly be QUITE DISAPPOINTED."
1,Read the book!,"Too bad this awful movie wasn't closer to ""The Book of the Dun Cow"" by Walter Wangerin, Jr. The book is definitely worth a read! I just wish the story hadn't been so brutalized by this horrible animation."
1,An animated Trainwreck,"This movie is so awful, I watch it once a year just to sit in awe of its vomit inducing production. Like eighty-five percent of Don Bluth's movies it features extraneous story development, grotesque character designs and the worst songs in the history of the animated musical. Anyone who lists it as more than two stars needs to have a drug test. But, if you enjoy watching an animated film on the level of a movie from USA Up-All-Night(circa 1988) then this is the animated movie for you. You have to Bluth some credit though, anyone who would try to turn the classic story of Chanticleer into an Elvis Musical has balls, too bad his weren't big enough to pull it off successfully, ""Rock-A-Doodle"" is the beginning(and the best) of a downward spiral of Don Bluth's movies into the depth of B-movie oblivion."
5,"Quincy, M.E. - Seasons 1&2","I remember watching this program when it first came out. I loved it then and still do. Jack Klugman's acting is superb and the story lines are outstanding. I never got tired of the program,even when it was in reruns. I wait for the next season to come out."
4,All these ignorant fools...,Taleb is clear and concise in his depiction of the total randomness of what we take as logical consequences of our actions! As usual he is a provocateur par excellence!
5,Fooled by Randomness,Excellent book. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in statistics or financial markets. I will be looking for more of Taleb's publications.
4,Good ideas ina good read,"Just when you think you can spot a trend, for example in the market, along comes this book to show how much is still left to chance and is unpredictable by your system. Sometimes overwritten, but gives illustrations that are worth considering."
3,Great concept but poor writing,"Well, what can I say? The concept of ""black swamp"" function is very original and as a professional investor, I appreciate the author's insight into this critical concept to long term return. However, the whole book is about this concept and I don't learn anything new after finishing the first few chapters. Moreover, the author is a trader rather than a writer which probably explain his less-than-perfect reading style. Readers have to be prepared for his ""non-linear"" logic and could be very confusing at times."
3,Worth reading,"I browsed the first 20 pages of this book at a store, was dismayed by the chatty asides and general litter interspersed between the real insights, and decided to buy a pirated version. Nassim Taleb's points on randomness and philosophy are all salient, but his self-indulgent, even confessional style is bizarre and takes away from the timeliness of his message. Taleb is not above insulting people, and I imagine the acerbic commentary on other intellectuals, the financial media, and much of the rest of humanity, help sell the book. Fooled by Randomness is still a good read. But it would be 150 pages shorter if the author cut the crap and got to the points sooner."
4,TIME WELL SPENT,I found this book informative. It does a very good job of illustrating the difficulty of dealing with quantitaitve financial decisions and our own reactive emotions.The insights provided made the reading of this book time well spent.
2,"One good thought, stretched out into a book","Would have been good if this was an article. Its a good, smart thought, and has some useful analysis. Just really doesn't require an entire book - you keep reading the thing over and over and over and over.... I stopped half way through, OK we got it, enough already!"
3,"5 for idea, 1 for execution equals mean of 3 stars","John Maynard Keynes said all of this better 100 years ago, and it formed the basis for his explanation of why the economy goes wrong. We form incorrect probabilities (with our animal spirits) that cause the problem -- house prices never fall. Then we enter into a period where we cannot estimate even invalid probabilities so we do nothing -- and the recession goes on for years. Read the original, he's better."
1,Fooled into buying,"This book is just a lot of hot air.You read page after page in anticipation of some great insights only to discover more and more waffle.There is not an iota of substance to it. It was a particularly frustrating read for me as I am a bond trader and I constantly got the impression that the author is trying to portray himself as a big deal to the ""lay man"".I am mystified at the endorsement by Fortune magazine ...the book is nonsense."
4,Interesting but the author's pedestal is too high,"Luck and the random events playing a large role in ""inducing"" this luck in life and various tasks in life is something even the most intelligent of people fail to perceive. This book brings this to our attention and from a traders' percepective, highlights the importance of not being fooled by lady lucks role in providing the ""comet"" trader with a shine of glory.Unfortunately, this important subject is over shadowed by Mr Taleb's pompous and condescending style of expression in his attempt to flex his intellectual muscles. Mr. Taleb should beware as history is full of such people being knocked off their high pedestals, a victim of their own arrogance.Nevertheless, an enjoyable book."
1,I missed it,"I heard rave reviews about this book so I picked it up from the library. I enjoy intellectual reads as much as the next guy, but I didn't find the material to be too stimulating. As many of the reviews indicated, I found the book to be drawn out and did not think there was a very good flow to it either."
1,A key topic but a weak book,"Taleb makes some valid observations on most peoples' weak skills at understanding randomness. But these are fairly simple, and described well elsewhere. And, what a bore Taleb is! He opens the book with one Nero Tulip (a weak pun on his own name) and then spends most of the book arrogantly and humorlessly talking about himself. He aspires to intellectualism, and drops more names than I can count. Some he idolizes, others he treats with extreme contempt. The second part of the book is a discombobulated collection of platitudes. Random, without a discernible signal, like most of what he tells us we shouldn't be reading. There is a thinly veiled promotion of his hedge fund (if ""all the quants"" use poor tools and misunderstand randomness, where does his wisdom come from?) An inelegant book that includes a lecture on personal elegance.There is little of substance here. Save your money and time."
2,Great book if you can get over the pomposity and self-aggrandizing tone,"I have to say, this is a book that has great content, but it is told in such a condescending fashion that it's a real turn-off. There were actually times that I couldn't read any further because the tone was so smug. It's too bad, because there are some real gems of knowledge in this book. I would recommend this if you truly have an interest in randomness and trends, but the delivery is appalling."
3,I have a love-hate relationship with this book,"Key requirements of a good book are that it challenge what I think I know and that it introduce me to interesting new ideas. So, despite its many faults, I am giving this book three stars. It challenged much of what I learned in finance and statistics, has spurred me to think more carefully, and has given me a number of great suggestions for further reading. The book's faults can be very distracting, however. Mr. Taleb is an ungracious, needlessly petulant writer whose attacks on others seem grounded in unthinking animus rather than substance. Instead of getting absorbed in his exposition (as in a great book, like ""Theory of Justice""), I found that Mr. Taleb's sense of superiority frequently distracted me from his arguments. Had he had a stronger-willed editor and replaced his gratuitous ad hominem attacks with more details supporting his main points, this might have been a great book."
3,Entertaining account of theory meeting practice.,"Entertaining read from a cheerful egomaniac Wall Streeter, recounting misadventures of people in the business and combining his real-world experiences with his broad reading of theory and psychology of randomness. Many Amazon critics address details but miss the point: there's a huge amount of theory out there in academia which I suspect almost all traders simply ignore. So it's fascinating (to me as an academic, anyway) to see what bits of theory impress him as relevant to traders: survivorship bias, data snooping, using Monte Carlo to see alternative futures, for instance."
1,Should have followed his editor's advice,"The author mentions that he refused to accept his editor's recommendations for the second edition of the book which is unfortunate. His writing style is similar to a drunkard's walk, weaving around and around, occassionally making a cogent point and then starts wandering around again.The book title does describe his writing style very well."
4,Humbling Insights,"Dr Taleb's book for the layman explains, using understantable logic and mathematics, how much success commonly attributed to skill is really luck. It should be humbling to the wealthy, and reassuring to the unlucky.A useful read for investors: Studies show that over-confidence degrades trading performance. We need to be continuously objective about our approaches and conclusions.Gift this book to your most arrogant lucky friend!"
1,"Ideas good, author annoying.","Nassim Taleb presents an interesting, and annoying look at how we react to random events. While the ideas and concepts are not new, they are presented fairly well with respect to a trader's life.What's not presented well is Nassim. The less said about Nassim himself, the better.I closed this book so loudly, the dog hit the ceiling..."
2,Wall Street meets Levant,"To say the least an unorthodox book, filled with musings, life lessons and philosophy of the author and one central theme about probabilistic events and how they are perceived and misinterpreted by even well trained professionals.If Mr. Taleb had stuck to his original thesis instead of branching out needlessly and had used the services of a professional editor, it would have made a more pleasant but much shorter read. Yes, there is also way too much of Mr. Taleb in the book, obviously a very smart and cultivated man with a sizable ego, who seems to carry a certain bitterness too.What was more interesting was the clash between the Middle Eastern genes of Mr Taleb and the extremely quantitative and results oriented culture of Wall Street and West in general. This is probably what led him to the thoughts that resulted in this book."
4,Good points but a lot of words,"Taleb points out some of the systematic errors in human expectations of future events and the general nature of random processes. His writing style is not my favorite, he chooses it put in a great deal of his own personality which at times makes it somewhat unclear. He has a few points to get across but uses 250 pages to do so; a bullet point version could sum it up in a few pages. But the stories included make it more memorable and it is a fairly enjoyable read, so I would still recommend it."
2,muzzy reading,"I found the book diffcult to follow because the author is writing down to his audience. He tantalizes us with broad generalizations but fails to provide the kind of back-up detail which will support his conclusions. His language in many instances is vague and the syntax unclear. I suspect the trouble is that he knows what he is talking about, but can't express his ideas clearly in layman's languague and he dare not get into the math of the subject because it is too complex. People who enjoyed the book mostly seemed to do so because he uses a variety of examples and techniques to provide amusing or human traits, but they simply do not add up to a clear exposition of his main theme. which, I think, is that when it comes to randomness few people can detect the signal from the noise. P. T. Barnum expressed it clearly and simply years ago. ""There's a sucker born every minute."""
1,This movie was not better than Chocolate,"I am afraid I was rather disappointed with this movie. I found the characters not very interesting or real. Frankly the movie was plain silly. I found Maggie's mother to be totally unbelievable and annoying. I mean would a mother, who has just learned that her daughter is a Lesbian, say ""Are you in love with her"". I cannot believe that. And Kim got upset because Maggie would not answer. Why the heck should Maggie answer that question whilst she was under so much pressure. That whole scene really grated me. I gotta give this DVD away."
2,Ehem,"This is almost just as good as the movie ""The Girl"" which seemingly happens to have some good sensual scenes in it, like this movie it does but it's not enough! - I give it only 2 stars, 1 for it's ability to make me rather eat a piece a chocolate than call this a great film and 2 for a worthy effort. It lacked depth. It lacked interest in these characters. It lacked almost everything. Even the comedy was a bit over-the-top. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this genre of movies but it just didn't motivate me to WANT to finish the movie, though I did... somehow....The cover of the movie lead me to believe this would be a great film. Yes I said it, I judged it by the cover! And I'll tell you, It was a deceiving picture. Don't buy it unless you want to add it to your LGBT collection.Rather, buy some chocolate!"
5,It's Finally Out on Video!,"I watched this movie in MA movie theatre.Like many of independent, low-budget films, the film-quality cannot be compared to the upscale Hollywood films but the story-line is of a typical Hollywood Romance Comedy.The movie was excellent! A must see! You will laugh and you will cry and you will laugh again and again!Everyone who left the theatre had a big grin on their face and would giggle at the littlest things like ""Out of Order"" signs - and if you watch the movie... beleive me you will laugh when you see one yourself!I recommended it to all of my friends and even made it a ""girls night out"" to see the movie in the theatre...Check it out, for yourself... You will enjoy it too!"
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,"Though the love between the two main women character was fast, I loved the connection they developed in such a short time.I have one question: what is the difference between the unrated version and the director's cut?"
4,chocolate is good for you,"I watched this movie with a woman I was going with on a dare one night...this is one of the sexiest movies I've ever seen ( especially the body painting scene ) plus the transsexual singing ""I'm not a ------- drag queen "" was hilarious. If you have an open mind, take a chance on it..."
4,I liked it,"Not ready for Prime Time, but I liked these women and the way they followed their feelings."
4,better than chocolate is really better than chocolate,"I've seen the movia a long time ago in a local cinema during the ""gay and lesbian film festival"", but didnt appreciate the humor in the film at that time. They are showing social realism and feministisc themes in a relaxed og humoristic way..."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Better than Chocolate means well, but the movie isn't very well-written and all the LGBT trappings can't hide a painfully formulaic romance between the main pairing; if you're in the mood for a lesbian romance please watch something good like Show Me Love instead."
3,Enjoyable,"This movie is a great addition to your gay and lesbian collection. There are many aspects of this movie that are very endearing. I would rate the overall quality of this movie as a B Movie, however that does not mean that the storyline and message are not worthy. I think it is an excellent movie for young gay women. This movie is also a good movie for Mother's of young gay women, provided that they are ready to see women loving each other."
4,comedy and romance in one,This is a great lesbian romantic comedy. I am a gay man but enjoy this movie and have it in my collection. It is about a young lady that is out on her own and has sub-leased/house sitting for a lady that is going out of town. She starts finding interest in another young lady when she finds out her mom is leaving her dad and shows up on her doorstep with her younger brother. The mother does not know that the daughter is gay. You then follow these members of the family as they grow socially and within the family. By the end of the movie it very heart warming. I do have to say my favorite scene is when the mother is on the bed in the bedroom. I do not want to give it away but when you see it you will know which scene I am referring to.
2,The Fight To Fly,"The movie demonstarted how determined the African- Americans were to succeed, and what they went through, during the 1940s. Many of them were not allowed to join the Army, but with their great desire to do what they wanted to do, they tried their best and some become pilots. I thought it was sad to see a persons dreams and wishes to be just pushed away, based upon their skin color. For the men who did succeed, it was wonderful. They suffered all that pain, extra work and humiliation just to be an airplane fighter pilot in WWII. Realizing their dreams and helping their country, however difficult, made a big difference in history."

Realizing their dreams and helping their country, however was very to hard to admit since they were treated badly. By them trying so hard, they made a big difference in history."
2,Okay,"This is no longer being used by us. The suction cups didn't stick very long, and the bag is VERY small, so it didn't hold much. Ended up buying a plastic toy holder and some hooks that have easy-remove adhesive. THAT works much better."
5,Cheap and handy,Inexpensive bath toy holder is great. It's cheap but does the job. Nothing fancy but holds more than I expected.
5,Step By Step RELEASE FULL SEASON DVDS,I have Television Favourites DVD and really want Season setsI would buy every seasonI don't know why it is taking so long for production company to releaseseason setsPlease release them very soon!!!
1,More Hogwash made for money!,"Any idiot should be able to read the dvd self-description and see it is just more ecumenical hogwash. Medieval seer usually means the Nostradamus demonic ramblings. If you really want to know truth read the Bible and find good Biblically aligned books, try Joel Richardson's The Islamic Anti-Christ' for a good start,and skip this type of trash which mixes every fake prophetic source they can find in an attempt to water down the true Scriptures which point only to Jesus. Shalom, JE"
4,What a bargain!,"I couldn't believe it when I saw the price on this book. Similar books go for as much as twice what this one is listed at! And the patterns are whimsical, fun, creative... My daughter is dying for the mermaid outfit, and I've already knit the backpack for her. Some patterns (like the crowns) are a little silly (why knit them for oodles of money and time when you can simply make them out of paper and let your kids decorate them themselves?), but overall, this book provides a great assortment of fun, interesting choices."
4,Good overview,"There are lots of introductory Pagan books available and this one takes a good overview of it rather than get into the ""nuts and bolts"" of what Pagans ""do."" The author begins with a brief history of Paganism before going to discuss their belief system, various ""Pagan holidays,"" and the tools used in celebrations.What sets this book apart from other ""beginners' books"" is the author's devoting chapters to specific Pagan religions, like Asatru, Druidry, Santeria, and Shamanism (although some would argue these are not necessarily Pagan religions). I also liked that topics like Pagan Ethics, The Role Of Magic, and Explaining and Protecting Your Beliefs were also discussed.This is a good book not only for the good amount of information it covers, but also because it provides the non Pagan with a general idea of what Paganism is in a nonjudgmental way."
1,Faulty quality control,"I ordered this set of DVDs, as well as the first season of ""I Love Lucy,"" for my niece, who had never seen the episodes. One disc was missing from the set, and four of the ten discs were scratched and unwatchable. And this was a new product!"
5,A Lovely Trip Down Memory Lane,"As an ""I Love Lucy"" fan, it's a joy to be able to have my own collection to watch whenever I need a fix. There's nothing like Lucy to cheer up your day and give you a good chuckle!"
5,I Love Lucy,I bought this for my sister as a gift. She really likes certain episodes and is glad to have them.
2,Humor feels forced,"There is some good information for beginning cooks in this book, but the snappy sidebars are too much. The humor feels forced---and dated, considering that this book seems calculated to appeal to recent graduates."
4,washes out too fast :(,"the ONLY problem I had with this product was the washing out sooooo fast... it smells great, it looks great, leaves my shine and dnatural highlights, I'm dark blond by the way so... i don't lighten my hair so be cairful if you do!"
5,Brilliant!,"This CD contains all of the most radical and amazing songs which caused the tremendous rise in David Bowies carrier. The album features two of the most remembered songs ""Space Oddity"" and ""Starman"" which are just two of the classics which resulted in the worlds music attention spanning into the space theme.This album is an absolute must for anyone even slightly interested in David Bowie and his music. Another outstanding album by an outstanding artist!"
4,Good Stuff,"This lotion WILL GET YOU DARK. It is a bit orange at first, as you tan you will get dark. For the money it is great. Ive been tanning for years, you wont go wrong with this lotion...."
5,LIKE UM DA MOVIE!!!,"MOVIE DON KOMPFEN BLONG DANGER! TRAVOLTA KLOG NOGGER TANG WHOPPER. MONG FOD KONGIN KEP FLOMPER. ""ROYAL WITH CHEESE"" HEE HEE DING NON KON BLOMPER. FLOG NOMPEN PUNG GOLOPIC!!! That's what I think about this movie."
1,"Generally, I LOVE Action Movies. This one was TERRIBLE.","This was literally one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. It has really dumb sucker humor (jokes based on old humor you've already heard in other movies) and images of explosions/heavy artillery in lieu of good acting or film-making. And every Pakistani in this movie is a terrorist or influenced by a terrorist? Why is that a normal plot device and not just using racial stereotypes to shortcut having to do anything creative?The plot is incredibly well-worn and completely predictable, if even in pieces. You may not know how the scene or situation will start (i.e the twists and turns some people allude to) but once the scene has started you can immediately pick the three most likely scenarios that will ensue, and be right. Is that comforting to you, in an action film? if so, this is the film for you. If you expect something more fun or smart, with good action or good plot, I say pass this one up. You can definitely find better."
1,worst,"Did you see Battlefield Earth? This is worst; everything is horrible - dialog, motive, special effects, you name it! It is the worst I have seen since Battlefield Earth, if you are a fan of John Travolta --- you will be embarrassed !!!!!!!!!"
3,"Fun movie, nothing spectacular","Fun to watch, not really super anything to comment about. Expected more from the reviews I saw here. If you get it for free, then it's worth watching, otherwise find something else."
3,"Sorry John, but you didn't convience me in this movie.","Well, there are the good guys and the bad guys, and you pretty much know what's going to happen from the start. John T. does not come across as the crazy good guy very well, and what is with that scarf John? Anyway, typical action movie, so you get what you get. If you are a fan of John Travolta you will probably like it."
1,"Un-interesting plot, bad acting, no character development",I just finished this movie and it ranks among the worst I've seen. The title of this review sums it up. 1.5 hrs of corny one-liners and a plot that is completely unbelievable. BOOOOOOOO!
1,"Excellent Movie, Atrocious on VHS","Theatrical release of ""The Long Goodbye"" = 4.5 stars Video release of ""The Long Goodbye"" = 1 starRobert Altman's noir pastiche, ""The Long Goodbye,"" is one of his funniest, most engaging, and aesthetically magical films (with gorgeous night photography of Los Angeles). Unfortunately, it is unwatchable on VHS. I rented it a few years back, found the film incomprehensible, and initially assumed that Altman's directorial work was poor. Then, I caught it in a repertory theatre and recognized the problem.This is a masterpiece, but it's impossible to make any sense of the pan-n-scan video; as in his other films (""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" ""The Player"") Altman takes full advantage of widescreen, a technique that is impossible to capture on a small television set. So do yourself a favor: avoid this video entirely, and either see the picture in a repertory house or wait until the distributors have enough sense to release it in letterbox."
1,A poor translation of an interesting book,"There's no doubt that Raymond Chandler is a wonderful writer. But this film version of The Long Goodbye does not do the book any justice. It throws out the 1930's historical context and sets the book in the 1960's. This does not work. Elliot Gould is totally miscast as Philip Marlowe, Chandler's famous private eye. Gould lacks the toughness and wit of Chandler's Marlowe as well as the mannerisms and philosophy. Not surprising, The Long Goodbye is a complete flop. Don't waste your time and money on this film even if you love Chandler, Marlowe and film noir. Thomas Lee."
5,Great LA movie and Altman classic,"Many people have reviewed this movie to death and most of the reviews spell it out. It's a great movie but what I really love about it is that it shows some great parts of Southern California, and LA in general. From the wacky apartment that Marlowe lives in to the Malibu Sea Colony you get a great feel for the city in the 70's...when it was better.I was born in Hollywood and raised in LA so I eat this stuff up. Other than that, it's a great movie and a good detective story. Great cinematography and the bonus features are solid. I've seen this movie many times and won't change the channel when it's on TV and pop in the DVD probably once a year."
5,I wanna be semetic.,"Altman films really do tend to be subjective beasts,but there has to be no denying that this film has one of the greatest openings in all of 1970's American cinema.Altman's most nihilistic film to date, and perhaps justifiably so if you stop to consider that Altman's vision of a morally bankrupt and shallow California is now well on it's way to being validated by a certain Austrian meathead, who way back in 1973 presumably had neither the foresight nor the mental fortitude to grasp the sheer irony of the situation as his even then dopey Aryan persona was deftly being blasted off the screen by the then righteous Elliot Gould's impenetrable Jewish cool.I want to see a sequel."
1,you get what you pay for,"It works fine, more or less, for printing text (never tried printing photos with it). But whatever money you save on the price of the printer you will pay back tenfold in ink catridges. This thing goes through ink at an unbelievable rate, and of course, Lexmark ink cartriges are among the most expensive (if not THE most expensive) of any brand.It's all about cost-per-page with printers, at least any printer that gets regular use. This thing is the printer equivalent of a Hummer, only less cool."
1,Very unimpressed,"This book was boring, sexist and not at all helpful. Instead of offering constructive ways in which men and women can get along, it both blames men and patronises women. A very negative book which can only discourage the single person who is looking for Mr or Mrs Right. The stereotyping approach is a gigantic leap backwards - this is the 1990s!"
2,Not for 77mm filters with cases...,"This will fit a 77m filter without case, but not a filter in a round or square plastic case. So if you're happy to have your filter in an enclosure that can let dust in at the top, and have the filter glass rub against the cloth in the case, you'll be fine with it. Not for me."
1,Ed and Lorraine Warren,I was very disappointed and bored. I had seen Lorraine Warren on another show and was excited thinking I was going to see her at work. But this was more of a long boring conversation.
5,"Intriguing, funny, insightful, useful","I've been interested in handwriting analysis since I was in my teen years, but I've found so many of the books on the topic to read like dry, boring textbooks. Not so with Michelle Dresbold's book. From the first page, Dresbold grabs the readers and entertains while instructing. I read the entire book in one day because I was so enthralled with her examples, her writing, and her information.I particularly liked the structure of the book, how she moved from some general information into more specific examples of analysis. And I felt like after finishing the book, I had a good enough grasp to begin a very rough analysis of the handwriting of those around me (hopefully we won't see any felon's hooks or pugilistic p's)."
3,Not impressed,This dvd was just ok. I own 2-3 other windsor pilates dvds and they are much better than this one. I prefer a full body workout when I do pilates and want to feel that I was challenged. This dvd really did not seem as challenging as other Windsor workouts. It was kind of boring too. I would recommend the full version of the Windor advanced fat buring workout (I got it on Amazon too)
3,Get the job done,Great jacks at a low price. Only reason for the low rating is because their warranty does little to nothing in the long run. Oh well should have checked that out before buying them.
5,Very nice,"Best thing about these jacks is the security pin, to prevent the jack from collapsing. Say if you or someone accidentally hit up on the handle when your under the car. At least now I can feel safe under the car knowing these have a extra feature that most jack stand don't offer."
1,THE BEST STUFF EVER!!! (not really),"Although the authers honestly believe that they are preaching the truth, they do not give real examples with real people. They have two made up characters, one is a ""ladies man"" because he follows the authors' techniqes, and the other one screws everything up because he does not follow their techniques. The one that does everything wrong is Bob. The one that has great success with women is Bruce. After the authors tell you what to do, they show you how Bob screws it up and Bruce does it ""right."" Everything is meaningless because they don't show how real people use the techniques they teach, they show how good their fictional character Bruce is at picking up girls using their techniqes. I and many others have a feeling that if Bruce tried these techniques in the real world, he would not get so lucky."
4,the rules of dating for a game without rules,"i purchase this book just for something to read in my sparetime,i haven't read it all yet.but i was drawn into what the authors were saying,they are not saying that men should be pigs and manipulate women.I think the whole scope of the book is to teach men how to be successful with women if he wants women as well as keeping the romance alive.So therefore i will have to disagree with some of the people who said this book teaches men how to manipulate women."
3,Reader from the West,"This book is a great start for guys who have little experience with women. I don't recommend this book for guys who already have the ability to approach women and set up initial dates. I think guys would benefit most from the ""myths,"" ""habits of effective seducers,"" and the ""confidence"" sections of the book. I think there's a process in dating: initial encounter, getting the number, setting up the first date, maintaining interest, getting physical. From my experience, this book is great at helping guys through steps one to three. But the tools/techniques advised will not help with steps four and five."
1,Tested tips for turning from a nice guy into a total creep,"The first mistake any man can make when they pick up a copy of this book is to actually take it seriously. This isn't a guide to finding the 'real thing'. Instead, you'll find dozens of ""techniques"" on how to find the perfect one night stand -- even if you despise the woman you're targeting. Here's everything you need to learn to lie, cheat, use and abuse someone until you move on to your next ""babe."" Quality women with a brain and a heart will either see through these techniques in a minute, or laugh at you. At any rate, they'll avoid you like the plague. This book offers a joyless, depressing, and arrogant way of looking at women and relationships. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,"Deception, Manipulation","The authors are psychologists. They do their best to convince you that it is OK to manipulate women and use them. If you abide by a code of ethics and honor, then I advise you to look for another book.This book is for you if you:- wish to learn how to manipulate women- do not mind using women- do not mind being dishonorableI advise looking for a book that is less superficial. Read other reviews for recommendations.I tried contacting the authors regarding their book, and have not heard back."
1,"A Reader from Dallas, Texas",Lots of quantity (as in pages); very little quality! Bigger is not always better. Save your money guys.
1,Get real!!!,This is the absolute worst information you could get on picking up women. Clearly these guys are clueless and writing whatever it takes to sell books. They're approach is all about kissing the woman's a$$. These guys are wussies!
1,The bottom and I don't mean derriere,"How does junk like this get published? This book says nothing that a 13 year old, of either sex, would not find objectionable. There is no concept, just a lot of low life deception that would turn off a girl of 15, not to say 24. The idea of there being a technology for relating to women is about as destructive as you can get. So where are these guys coming from?"
5,Very Insightful,I just bought this book yesterday. I haven't finished it but I will have read it at least once by the end of the week. What I have read let's me get inside the hearts and minds of all the women that I have ever dated as well as the minds of all the men who enjoyed more success with women than I have. I can tell that this is one book that I will treasure because of all it offers.
1,Skip it. The authors don't know jack.,"To read this book you have to first believe its methods work, which they don't because women are on the look out for guys who just want sex. Second, you have to be interested in just scoring. If you pass those two tests, then by pass the book because it won't help. Like does somebody really have to tell me women like flowers and I should show up with a clean car? This is major advice? And like women aren't gonna see through the lame plots they give you to score. The book goes on and on but says nothing I did not already know from common sense. Skip it."
3,Interesting Nuggets...IF you can find them...,"Too many words, so it isn't easy to find that which is actually insightful. I spent three days on a vacation reading this book, and I still didn't get laid. And I seriously doubt any other book will do that for you either. C'Mon guys...let's get real about relationships."
1,How to Succeed with Women,How to Succeed with Women is a lame book. This lame book shows you how to get 1 million women. It seemed to me this book blocks you from The Tenth Commandment of God. This book sucks!!!
1,A Masterpiece for Suckers,My name is Richelle And I have things to tell. If you think this will help you get lucky Then you're pretty schmucky. What we want is romance Not your eyes on our underpants. Cheap tricks don't fool us But guys with character can rule us. Women are not stupid When it to comes to Cupid.
1,So where's the meat?,"This is a long, wordy book that lacks substance. It makes many promises based on ploys from I know not where for bagging women. I doubt that this is a research work and I would not try its methods because they are obviously nonsense. The book lacks the integrity and painstaking research of the same title by Dr. Badalamenti, a book that helped me get oriented and become more successful with women."
5,Great!,I got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. He was very happy with the books that came with and was playing in no time.
4,Entertainment with old-fashioned action,"Being a fan of Steve Reeves since the late 50's, I enjoyed this one. If you watch and listen carefully, one can't help but to recognize similarities in Star Wars, episode IV. And, not being a muscleman movie, but in the traditional Steve Reeves style, there is a scene where he shows off his ""classic physique."" These simple elements, along with a bit of cultural history, made this movie enjoyable and pure ""fun"" to watch."
5,Compendium of English,This compendium of English harnesses the power of Longman corpus of Spoken American English and Longman Corpus of Written American English. You can rest assured that its contemporary usage database will serve the English learner well.
1,unknown hose fittings,"I purchased this waterfall faucet, and have been to 3 plumbing supply stores, none of which have fittings that allow this faucet to be attached to normal plumbing. My valve openings in the bathroom are for 3/8in female hose ends, but the faucet comes with a size that no one can even rig with multiple adapters. It's got a compression fitting, but not with compression threading! The threading is for normal piping. Therefore a seal can't be made between the faucet hose fitting and anything else. Very frustrating, so now I'll have the added hassle of the return."
1,Works--for a month or two,"I'm on my second one. It works quite well with a PS/2 mouse, but for only about a month or so. Then it fails. I've tried the small plug-in adapters, but they do not work with mice. Maybe there's something out there that will work for the long-term, but this adapter isn't it."
2,Doesn't work for me,"I already have exactly one that is similar to this one that works perfectly. This one makes everything stutter, multiplies keystrokes, stutters the pointer all over the screen, turns on commands not asked for (like delete) and makes life on a desktop miserable. I have no idea how to correct this as there is no software to install/control it with other than what the os seems to think is needed."
1,Note to self: read descriptions very carefully.,"I bought this planning to use my old ergo keyboard and trackball (PS2) with my new computer that didn't come with PS2 ports. Turns out it has USB 2.0; this adapter may work on USB 1.0 or 1.1, but it DOESN'T work with USB 2.0. Live and learn. Other adapters' descriptions clearly state USB 2.0, and are much more expensive. My mistake. However, price was right."
4,Good for the price,"I may misunderstand how this product is designed to work, but I cannot get both the keyboard and mouse to work simultaneously running through this adapter. This is not a deal breaker because modern ATX motherboards still have one PS2 port. I am using the adapter to change the PS2 mouse to a USB mouse and directly connecting the PS2 keyboard to the computer.I am running both keyboard and mouse via a KVM switch. There is not issue with switching between computers. For under $2 delivered I cannot complain."
2,Doesn't work with CueCat,"I bought this adapter specifically to use an old CueCat barcode scanner with a laptop that doesn't have a PS/2 port. One other reviewer mentioned that it worked, so I bought it. Unfortunately, the device is recognized, the light on the CueCat comes on, and the keyboard works until you try to scan a barcode. After that, the keyboard locks up, and nothing comes out. Tried two different adapters (both the same model), but no luck.Not sure if this works for other purposes, but if you're trying to get a CueCat to work, look elsewhere."
2,Didn't work for me.,I tried to use this on my laptop with a ps/2 keyboard. It worked for about 50 char and would just stop working. I tried to unplug it and replug it.. again.. about 50 or so char. I gave up and bought a usb keyboard.. that works great.
4,usb to ps2 adapter,"It worked as advertised but it took more than two weeks to arrive from Hong Kong, which not too bad."
1,Didn't work for Symbol barcode scanner.,The reason I purchased this was to use for my Symbol LS4000 barcode scanner through my USB ports. Doesn't do that.
1,READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY,"The cables do not work as you would expect them to. They do not allow you to connect a typical Keyboard or mouse with PS/2 plug to a PC USB port. Upon further review you find that such connection requires a ""converter"", not just an ""adapter"" - As far as I'm concerned it is just a worthless cable. BUYER BEWARE!!Not worth the hassle to return for the $2.35 it costs."
5,It works,Easy way to utilize older keyboards and mice on newer machines. I have lots of old ps2 stuff that works just fine with it.
1,USB TO PS/2 ADAPTER DONT WORK,"I bought this item hoping to use it instead of the pad mouse on my laptop, I hooked it up to a ps2 optical mouse and then into the laptop, it did not work at all, I had to buy a usb mouse and that worked great."
3,Only One Problem,"I use this every day to connect my PS/2 keyboard and mouse to my laptop's USB. The only problem is that the first key that I hit after booting up always comes out as gobbledeegook. However, once the cache or whatever is cleared it works great the rest of the day."
5,Works great!,"Plugged it in with keyboard and mouse, after a few moments everything was working as expected. Great product!Tim"
4,excellent customer service but can't use - product malfunction,"There was some sort of mailing mishap or delay with this. I contacted the shipper, and they apologized and sent me another one. In the meantime, the first one came. I contacted them and they said I could go ahead and keep both. I wanted it to use with my old ""favorite"" keyboard with my newer computer that needed a USB hookup for keyboard. It worked okay, except that certain keys didn't work right - like I think it was the spacebar that came up at the letter ""K"" or similar, so I really couldn't use it. I am just using a different keyboard now that is a USB instead of my old ""favorite"" keyboard with adapter. Oh well - I tried. I don't think this malfunction is any cause of the seller's though."
5,Handy little guy,Converted my laptop to a desktop and used this gadget to save myself from using more usb ports than I had to. Nice if you have the old hook-ups for mouse and keyboard. I would definitely recommend.
3,Solid Coffee Pick,"Jeremiah's Kona Blend is a good tasting, middle of the road coffee bean. While not as flavorful as J's Fogbuster, the Kona is light and mellow, offering a nice change of pace for dark roast drinkers. I brew in a french press most mornings, but when I ran it through a drip machine for company the flavor became too slight. Be prepared to grind a lot of beans if you brew drip. Overall a good pick and a good value."
1,Not quality coffee beans,"These beans are so dry they crumble. Horrible coffee. Reminds me of the starbuck's beans you get at Walmart. Yuck. Avoid at all costs, they are not what they appear."
1,the F-ups live up to their name!,"They totally suck. i seen them with Papa roach and i wanted to punch myself in the face. they were just a bunch of noise. if they had only one song like element 80 does.. then they'd be good. all their songs sound the same. they have no variety at all. save your money and buy something like matchbook romance, thrice, fall out boy, finch, the plain white t's, hawethorne heights or some other good band."
2,Ugh.,"Vaguely catchly tunes pulled down by hilariously accidentally-hypocritical lyrics.More specifically, anyone who's ever heard the song Lazy Generation hopefully realized the incidental irony in it; that this joke of a band fancies themselves self-reflective and introspectively alert, and at the same time, the basic lyrics to the song are:""We are the lazy generation,We are the lazy generation,We are the lazy generation, NOW.""And this repeats at least two times each time you hear it.I'd have to agree with the basic message; such sloppy and lazy lyric writing I've not seen in any of the music from more than ten years ago. Hell, the first line of the first song starts out with the rhyme 'line' and 'time', for Chrissakes! Does that bode well to anyone?Then they use generic punk-esque rebellious crap and random adrenaline-forcing shouts like ""LET'S GO!"".Generic and a waste of time."
5,Amazing!!!,I just got the Cd after a whole week of anticipation.......its amazing... it was worth the wait....my favorite song is Screw You....i dedicate it to all the people that were ever mean to me....oh yea ( \m/Lazy Generation Represent\m/-I'm XViciousDreamerX )
1,"movie for ""Dopes""...","This movie was so poorly made and low-budget, that it has motivated me to buy a Canon XL1 Camera and make my own film. The acting is bad, the plot is unrealistic, and the script is poor. Thanks for the motivation."
4,Maybe it's just me?,"This is the second time that I've tried Thai Kitchen noodles and both times it was kind of gross. I really wanted to like them because they're vegetarian, but they just taste off to me. Maybe I'm getting really old packs or something? Maybe they're just too bland for me. Yes, I followed the directions and put in all the seasonings. I might try it again with barely any water in it and see if it tastes better.____________________________________________*UPDATE*Okay. I tried the Spring Onion again, but this time I boiled the noodles for about 5 minutes, drained all the water, added the oil and seasonings and mixed. It actually tasted pretty good this way. There was no weird off flavor this time. I added some crushed red pepper to make it spicier. I actually enjoyed the noodles today. I would just recommend trying to eat it soon after cooking if you drain the water because the noodles will start to stick together. Hope this helps."
1,"""Loire"" is made in China",These knives are not made by the French company Sabatier. They claim to be stainless steel but will exhibit rust spots very quickly. The rust can be removed with difficulty but will reappear after one wash.
5,Great entertainment for Grandchildren,I would reccomend The Iron Giant. It was entertaining for my grandchildren as well as the adults. I had seen another version in black and wilte this one was in color.
3,Nice but cheep,"This set is not too bad but the blades are not the same as shown. Its a pretty cheep set but nice for the price, good for beginers."
5,Terrific prenatal yoga,This prenatal yoga workout is calming and yet keeps a good pace and gives a good workout. I especially like all the ways the workout helps work on posture. I highly recommend Sara Holliday's yoga workouts. It is a fabulous way to stay toned while you are pregnant.
1,Keeps cold for 30 minutes,"I bought this at Mothercare because COLD expressed milk is vital for my baby. I placed expressed milk in the thermal tote and 20 minutes later when I tried to feed, I noticed that the bottle felt like I just took the bottle out 30 minutes earlier at room temperature. It is 40'C here and cannot afford to have warm breastmilk when the sun is beating down on us. Perhaps it will work better by adding in freezer packs but the ""3m technolgy"" should not make you buy more gear to keep the bottles cold. A stainless steel thermos can do the job better.I am disappointed because I depeneded on the Avent label to keep the avent bottles cold; it failed and too bad I cannot return it. Now I will return the Avent diaper bag."
5,awesome,this show was so awesome! i can't believe it got cancelled. the characters were great and it was very funny.
4,TRULY gentle and accessible to people dealing with a variety mobility issues,"Excellent modified routines, from very gentle to gentle challenge. Very gentle chair series is especially beneficial for people who are not ready for floor work; wonderful relaxation techniques and internal visualizations.The only drawback is that it's necessary to pause in order to transition from floor to chair,there's no set transition, and the floor poses begin immediately after a brief abstract interlude. The instructor is lovely, healthywithout being intimidating and the dvd has apleasant tone that is neither new-agey nor yoga-preachy. It's a real workout, subtle, relaxing & rejuvenating."
4,"Quality low level adventure, a race against time","One common question I get - ""So why didn't they print any more N modules after N1? That adventure was amazing!"" Well, they did, and they're all as good as N1, but the print runs were so shamefully small that N2 through N5 are some of the most difficult-to-collect introductory adventures in existence. In the idyllic meadows of the Downs, the Druids of old have faded into legend - some say they still protect the farmers from the deepmost woods, but others believe them to be legends. But now, a horrible blight has rotted the land, and an ancient man says that he remembers them - and someone must journey through the perilous wilds and find them. A great, challenging adventure for levels 2-4."
3,kind of a mess. second tier Shaw Bros & Chang Cheh,"I'll keep it simple. The Tokyo Shock edition is well presented, but the movie is not very exciting and kind of hard to follow. Too many characters, confusing scenarios set up the fights, and overall I didn't enjoy this film. Tokyo Shock does a good job with their releases of classic Shaw Bros martial arts, but this film just isn't up to their usual standards."
1,rip off,"$5.00 over the local grocer's regular price. I expected a fair market price when I placed this order, but because I didn't research it I was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. Live and learn, I hope I can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return."
3,Just fine.,"There aren't many books about Bollywood available on market, but I'm sure there should be something better than this one. The English is kind of hard to understand, many points in the book are repetitive."
2,A decent read - no notes.,"The book gives a decent history - only there are no notes ond a listing of WHERE the quotes came from. Impossible to use for academic purposes - Document, document, document!"
2,Key concept is undefined,"The author tells you to exercise at certain intensity levels but nowhere in the book is ""intensity level"" quantitatively defined. Instead, he tells you that when you are winded enough you at the right intensity level.The book sets out guidelines for aerobic exercise using heart rate but heart rate does not equal intensity rate. You are supposed to figure ""intensity rate"" out for yourself by how distressed you get while exercising.Sort of like that famous US Supreme Court definition of obscenity: I know it when I see it."
5,Superbly presented and wonderfully illustrated guide.,"Ready, Set, Go!: Synergy Fitness For Time-Crunched Adults by health, fitness, and exercise expert Phil Campbell, is a superbly presented, step-by-step, practical and effective guide to increasing the body's natural anti-aging growth hormone; looking years younger while achieving optimum health and fitness; developing a sprinter's physique regardless of one's age; rediscovering and recovering the energy of youth. A fully and profusely illustrated workbook, Ready, Set, Go! is ideal for the novice beginner at any age, and is a welcome and useful reference for college and professional athletes as well. Highly recommended for personal, physical education department, and community library health and fitness reading lists and reference collections."
1,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer ""Jerome Back."". There is no way to quantify ""30 percent intensity,"" ""40 percent intensity"" and so on.I wrote to the website in the book, and asked the same questions twice. All I kept getting back were more ""articles"" which weren't really artlikes at all, but extracts from the book. What's the use of selling information if you're not told how to put it into practical use?The book itself is about 70% longer than it needs to be due to print large enough to use on a billboard, completely useless photos, and puff pieces talking about the book itself! The thing could have been condensed to about 15-20 pages.The useless photos, wasted ""hype space"" for the book itself, and the AWFUL customer service mar any useful information. After buying the book, I'm still going to have to enlist the use of a trainer to decipher the information.All in all...a waste of money."
2,You need a high end computer,"I have an Athlon 4.2+ dual core, 1 GB RAM , Graphic card Radeon X1300 512MB. This flight simulation is a good one, but you need an expensive computer. Unfortunetely, I won't see the cool graphics in my computer.cnr -- adrian"
1,It's from Microsoft all right,Wont install and unlike Dave I'm not so inclined to reinstall XP and backup/restore 300gigs of files just to play it. My computer is new and top of the line. Disappointed and definitely returning it
1,no install,"I purchased this game being very excited to play it. Little did I know that it was such a hard thing to install. When I put it in the DVD slot in my hard drive it did nothing, it just spun like it was going to do something. I don't want to take it back because that is what I spent all of my MONEY ON!. I would recomend this game to any one who wouldn't like to play FSX but would like to play THE INSTALL GAME.I am so UPSET ."
1,Difficult to maneuver via the keyboard,"Using the keyboard is clumsy, and I keep crashing. Maybe I need a joystick, or that other device."
1,This game played too slow on my computer.,After a successful installation and 2-3 weeks of attempting to play this game I uninstalled it from my computer
3,Microsoft Flight Simulator X Standard DVD,"You'll need about 4 Gig of space on hard drive for the install. Many airports to choose from. Really need a duo-processor with 2 gig Ram to be able to turn-up the details in the scenery. For some Planes, some of the dashboards in cockpit will take up half the screen, so you can't see landing strip."
5,My Favorite Game,I think Flight Simulator X the greates game product in the market because is very realistic. The Multiplayers is amazing. But the connection with GameSpy is the only problem. Thanks. If you want to buy this product at a low price and the cd's in exellent condiitions. Please visit my inventory.
2,Dr. nassan,"The Book is interesting and informative, however very subjective and at times misleading. The bias is a string that is woven throughout the book and does not leave allot for the reader to judge. As much as the book was interesting to read, the smell of propaganda could not be unnoticed."
4,Classic,"Growing up in the Midwest United States in the 80's, every so often we had a school movie day with old films projected on the gymnasium wall for all grades to see. Everyone's favorite was anything involving Laurel and Hardy.""The Flying Deuces"" is a classic. Silly and poorly made by today's standards, it is still a fun romp if you take it at face value and don't treat it too analytically.This edition of ""The Flying Deuces"" is readily available at most Wal-Marts for only a dollar. Hardly a risky investment."
5,Insightful analysis of wide range of Indian films,"This book looks at all the well-known films-- My Beautiful Laundrette, Mississippi Masala, Monsoon Wedding, Bend It Like Beckham. But it goes beyond to also examine films that aren't as talked about in the U.S.-- Fire, My Son the Fanatic, Bhaji on the Beach, and Masala. Throughout, Desai's analysis is in-depth, yet also accessible for the non-academic who just likes to read about Indian movies. Drawing on feminist and queer theory, Beyond Bollywood guides us to a fuller understanding of the significance of these films."
2,Not recommended for young girls! Highly suggestive/degrading,"This was recommended to my daughter (9 years old) by a classmate. I'm very disappointed by the sex-emphasis in this song. The tune includes the supposed voice of ""Ken"" who sounds more like a pediphile than a ""boyfriend."" The lyrics make ""Barbie "" out to be a nympho completely devoted to the salacious desires of ""Ken"" or whoever (""you can touch my hair, undress me everywhere. ."" ). This song would do nicely in a nightclub or topless bar, but not suitable for a young girl."
3,Great toy for imaginative play but very poorly made,"This toy is great for collector's, but was not made well for children. My five year old son play's with it often, and we have exchanged it twice, and the tentacles keep breaking. We finally glued them to his back. Then it was fine, until the pinchers at the end started to break off. Now 3 of the 4 tentacles are down to 2 pinchers, and these cannot be glued, now we are going to try melting the plastic. This is unfortunate, as it is an excellent toy to play with in a battle with spiderman, and it is very realistic. But soon we will have to replace it, and as others have mentioned, it is very hard to find. I toured every store in my city that sells toys, and finally found it, but very difficult, as as stated by others, Toys r' Us confirmed only 1 comes in every box, the rest is Spiderman. Apparently the villians aren't as popular as Spiderman!!!???"
1,I was very disappointed in this,"The octopus arms do not stay in. One would not stay at all, making it a very disappointing birthday gift for my grandson. That was the one gift he wanted to play with right away, and it will have to be returned. I am not sure the next one would be any better."
5,"Strong, durable, and long-lasting flashlight!",I stand by all the Stinger flashlights. They're line of products are very reliable and durable. The Ultra Stinger is one of my favorite lights and will light up a room with ease!
3,"Good, but not that bad either.","Maddox delves into wishfull thinking like most do but this goes beyond that, it is the ultimate dream. At the close of history humankind develops a super computer or machine which becomes an energy field then later evolves into a being capable of time travel. The moral of the story is that we should not destroy ourselves before we can save ourselves permenantly. I did enjoy the book, a bit lofty, but does stir thinking."
1,"I read it cover to cover, what's it about?","I waited patiently for my copy and was disappointed. This story makes no sense to me at all. It begins very slow and just remains as such. There are parts where it seems okay, but then suddenly things get blurry. A very hard book to follow, I don't care what the reviewers think. .this is a poorly written piece of work."
3,new guest,"when i order for any movie , dvd or vhs . i have to watch some thing from these in computer first to make sure that which i want it ."
5,Tired of waiting for the DVD?,"I am also looking forward to this movie on DVD. However, instead of waiting and being frustrated, here is an idea for you.Look for this movie on eBay/the web on ""LaserDisc"" (remember that format?). Much higher quality than VHS and doesn't degrade over time.Pay a service $30 to transfer the LaserDisc to DVD or digital (MP4) and you will now have a great copy of the movie on DVD/Digital.Just a thought for sharing until the movie actually hits DVD.:O)"
4,I'm With You,"""I'm With You"", that follows the cuts ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"", is the third single from ""Let Go"", and it's is an increible, soft, melodic and bombastic song. The single incluides two versions of ""I'm With You"" - the album version and live in Mexico- and a live version of ""Unwanted"", plus the video of ""I'm With You"", shooted by the director David LaChapelle in LA. I really like this single so you must have it!!!"
3,"Good machine, Terrible instructions.","I ordered this machine because I wanted a large, bright display. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. And the display is great.The manual, however, is awful. It is in many languages. The print is small and what it says is not very informative. It does show samples. If you are used to this type of machine, it is probably adequate, but I'm not.I have been able to use it, but I haven't had the patience to learn all the things it can do.Also they only include a tiny roll of paper."
4,FINALLY!!,"Not to be confused with the 80s movie of the same name, ""The Monster Squad"" was a fond memory from my childhood. This 70s NBC Saturday morning show featured a pre ""Love Boat"" Fred Grandy as Walt, a night watchman ata Hollywood-type wax museum who was also a criminology college student during the day. He built a ""Crime Computer"" to monitor police activity during his shift. The computer somehow brought to life the statues of the Frankenstein Monster, Dracula, and the Wolfman(not Laurence Talbot, but Bruce WW. The initials stood for WereWolf). To make up for past misdeeds, the three use their unique abilities to fight crime. The show featured ""special guest villians"" like Marty Allen, Alice Ghostly, Jonathan Harris, amoung others. If the show reminded you of the 60s ""Batman"" tv show, that's because both shows were produced by the same people. I can't wait for this DVD, and I still think an updated version of this show would work today."
3,Holistic Medications can still be harmful,"I ordered Dr. Goldstein's book and have found it very enlightning on the alternative methods of treating animals holistically. I fortunately have a great holistic vet, but after Bailey suffering with allergies, and reading Dr. Goldstein's suggestion, I dosed him with the recommended dosage of homeopathic meds that Dr. Goldstein recommends. My dog had a very very bad reaction to one of the ingredients in this medication and could not breathe. My dog is fine now, but I think that what you should take away from this book is the value of holistic treatments, but don't assume that just because it is homeopathy that there are not risks involved. I was very lucky with my dog Bailey, and I would just make sure that if you are interested in treating your animal holistically that you do it under the advice of a trained vet."
5,Amazing!!!!,"This book is life changing for me and my animals. It not only applies to animals but to humans as well. The same herbs can be used for both. I told my mother and she ran out and bought a copy of this book. She was amazed when some of the very same herbs she was taking were in the book were being recommended for animals. We had to board our dogs recently and I specifically didn't want them to vaccinate my 12 1/2 year old dog for bordetella(kennel cough) but they did it anyway. When we got home, my dog was coughing I went to the book and followed the directions and by God it worked. I didn't want my poor old girl dog on antibiotics see pg 29. I am a believer!! I now tell everyone animal lover I know to read this book."
4,It's very educational but.....,"I learned a lot from this book, both about animal and human health issues and the current and past issues and how they often relate to each other. He writes well as the book holds your interest throughout. I was deeply dissapointed though when I started to consult with his office on my dogs' health problems and was told that the ground breaking treatment he gets from a scientist that he expounds on in great depth in the book is no longer available. Also after trying the dog food he and his brother created together I had poor results and was told by a pet store owner that he hears that often from other pet owners. I would advise all to read this book though as it is quite educational in terms of both you and your pets health."
2,"Read The Book, Tried the Suggestions","I read this book because I had heard something about it at a local pet store. I tried some of the suggestions in it and, although I was hoping for the ""miracles"" that Dr. Goldstein suggests happens, I didn't have that experience myself. I can't say that he's wrong, but I don't believe in his magic cures. I still think nutrition is very important, but a good book doesn't build up your hopes just to let you down. This book has some good points but, in general, I think it's full of a lot of stuff that can't be proven by medical science, and I personally didn't have a lot of luck."
5,FANSTATIC,"Love the book! Very good reading, Dr. Goldstein's writing is not dry and boring making it a trail to get through. Very informative, if you have ever thought about giving your dog a healthier life this is a book you need to read and keep on your shelf for reference. I have already refered back to this book numerous times. And my dogs (3 Great Danes)are already looking and felling better than they have before. It has also taught me not to take everything at face value but explore your options. Just because it has always been done that way, does not mean it is the best way!"
5,Songs from the Wood - a great album,"Jethro Tull ""Songs from the Wood"" is one of my all time favorite albums.It is a great mix of true rock liberally stirred into ancient Celtic folk music. The classic guitar and rock and roll flute mix beautifully with dulcimers, mandolins and a host of other instruments. The lyrics are interesting and entertaining as well. What's not to like?I can listen over and over and never get tired of it."
3,Decent knife but did not last me long ....,"I bought this knife a couple of years ago and enjoyed using it for a while. The blade kept a sharp edge but the serrations on the inner edge would sometimes cut my thumb as I released the lock bar to close the blade. They were like little razor blades. Eventually, the knife jambed open and when I attempted to repair that the knife fell apart and I chucked it."
4,Great Every-day All purpose Knife,"Length:: 3:30 Mins8/1/12In conclusion:Great knife.Great metal.Great price.Sharp.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Full Review:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------More details:Pros-The blade has a great weight. A tad small in my opinion. The serrations vs the smooth part of the blade is just right. I have had a very good experience with Winchester knives before. Beautiful wood. The metal looks great. I am very happy with my purchase.I would highly recommend this.Cons-*The knife, as previously mentioned, is kind of small for my large hands.*The blade is very stiff and so is the locking mechanism. Not too much of a complaint since its new. If it does not loosen up I will apply some WD-40.Overall, great purchase."
4,Winchester knife,Nice knife. I used this for a Christmas gift so I really don't know how it will perform. Quality and its ability to last is questionable.
1,?????????,"I couldn't believe that this book got such high ratings. What a waste! The heroine was a skank, the hero was just plain stupid. I mean, who hooks up with someone when they don't know who they really are (I mean besides someone who is stupid.)? The whole amnesia bit went on WAY too long. Of course everything conveniently fell into place in the last few pages. HA!"
3,"A decent read, but could have been a little better","The story was good, but I was a little disappointed with the many typos in dialogue and the repetitive phrases and events."
4,Page turner,"Very good page turner, but would've liked a little more to the ending and how cissy took the news of living with her aunt."
5,Peggy Lee does jazz like no one else!,A vintage recording of excellent songs with beautiful instrumentation and the natural jazz abilities of Miss. Peggy Lee herself.
2,Marihuana Unlimited Productions presents:,"Benito Juárez carries everywhere a portrait of Lincoln and then begs forgiveness to the corpse of Maximilian. WOW! One day I'm gonna make a movie about Lincoln, of how he carried around the portrait of Juárez while apologizing to a dead Stonewall Jackson!"
3,in the middle leaning to the not so good and the good side.,"I would probally regret buying this book, even if i do like animals. The book WILDLIFE-HABITAT RELATIONSHIPS:..... SEEMS KIND OF BORING."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is possibly one of the worst books about groupwork with adolescents that I've ever purchased. Not only was the presentation itself very poor (sloppily formatted, typos on some of the pages) but the content was so simplistic and obvious that it was almost embarrassing. Halebsky's suggestions are for exactly the type of activities/discussions I throw together in 3 minutes when I haven't had time to prepare a ""real"" group. My participants are extremely demanding--they need to be entertained and active while participating in the therapeutic process. I was hoping for a book that would give me some fresh new ideas about providing experiences for them, rather than the same old chitchat which they find repetitive and boring, but this book wasn't it. Maybe the population I'm serving is more difficult to work with than Halebsky's target audience, but I was very very disappointed with this offering."
3,Somewhere in the middle,"Im between the two extremes of the previous reviewers. I disagree with the negative reviewer that the series did nothing to document Patton's tactical skill. On the contrary it did that quite well. Further, it documented the skills of his subordinate commanders which any student of WW2 WOULD be interested in. Also, it paid due respect to the skills of the German commanders. THIS the series did very well. Rommel and Kesselring are of course well celebrated in the espisodes. But outside of students of the subject, who knows that much about Manteuffel? Yet here he is given justified attention. So are the early battles against the Vichy French. Where I agree with the negative reviewer was the repetition of the simulated graphics and stock footage, although some of the footage IS rare. In short, the series could have been reduced in length and been more impactful.3.5 stars."
3,There are better options,"The price does not justify the quality of this text. All of the bits are there, but the presentation is kind of frustrating. The authors present the calculus of variations without introducing technical details, and then followup with the details in later chapters. I find this approach confusing and I end up jumping back and forth. A much better alternative is Charles Fox, ""An introduction to the calculus of variations"", and it's less than $10."
4,Good tool box.,I work on aircraft and got this box so I could haul tools around. This is a typical 2 drawer portable box. Nothing fancy. I looked at Craftsman boxes and thought this was going to be a little heaftier. They seem to be about the same. I could have saved some money buying the Craftsman box as they were on sale at the time. I do keep alot of tools in it and it seems to hold up well. I've been using it for about 3 months now. Wish I got one with a third drawer. Not a bad box though.
2,"This is, at best, a collection of news stories","This ""bio"" which was obviously hastily churned out right after the 1994 assault on Nancy Kerrigan, doesn't tell the reader anything that hasn't already been printed in news stories. It's doubtful that the writers even interviewed anyone in the Harding camp; for instance, they repeatedly refer to her mother as LaVona Golden, when the woman doesn't even use that name. A shameless attempt to cash in on the scandal."
5,My Very Best Favorite Christmas CD,"Since I always start listening to Christmas music in November (sometimes I just can't get enough of it) this is always the first CD I play. As a matter of fact, it's on now while I search for a possible new 'very best favorite' Christmas CD.I gave a copy of this to a friend for Christmas a few years ago and she plays it all year round. It's the kind of music that seems to lend itself to helping you get into a relaxed and emotionally peaceful mood.Can't say enough good things about Narada's music. Listen to the samples and you'll be hooked. It's not your typical church sounding music - a very nice twist on the old holiday favorites."
1,roadfood,"thought this would be a comprehensive list of many eating placesin california and the western coast. Lacking in eating places onthe coast roads up to the oregon border. very disappointed in this book Where are the places inEureka, Arcata, Truckee, etc."
1,TEMP.ting to ...,".... I've done a bit of temp work, and this ...is waaaaaaay over the top. job sheets?? write down every single thing your asked to do, the time you were asked, the time you completed it?A hand made tapestry saying you smoke and i croak? I dont smoke personally, but no one likes a smart [aleck]Anti Smoking crusader.working within a 5 kilometer radius and no further, [could be] burning your own bridges...."
1,Eight Is Enough Season One,"On 6/2/12 i opened my dvd box set of Eight Is Enough Season One. I watched the first disk and it was great. However, When i tried to watch disk 2 and 3 they both skipped and stopped during the shows. I will have to exchange disk 2 and 3 for new ones, because the ones in my box set don't work."
2,What happened here?,"I have other recordings with Capella Savaria, Nicholas McGegan and Pal Nemeth and I like them all, but for some reason this one just isn't very satisfying. Vivaldi's sinfonias are airy cream puffs and, I think, should be played with great energy and a quick tempos, but here they sort of just creak along in a dispirited way. Even the precious RV 149 which is normally a vivacious piece seems to lumber along like a ton of bricks. You would definitely do better with any other recording of the sinfonias. I really don't know what happened during this recording to otherwise excellent musicians and ensemble."
2,Who's ZOOmin' Who??,"Though there are a few good poems--The Impossibility of Languge, The Name of Things, Mother Sends My Poem..., Poem Not to Be Read..., Asked for a Happy Memory..., Why I Can't Cook..., I Would Like to Go Back...--I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in OPEN HOUSE. I bought the book on the basis of Poem Not to Be Read... and all the fantastic reviews and places where the poems had been published, prizes won and all I can do is cover Aretha Franklin singing Who's ZOOmin' Who? with emphasis on ZOO! How this MS got published is totally beyond me..."
5,Outstanding,"Just outstanding... too bad Amazon doesn't have audio samples to give you a taste to help sell this. The pieces are superb to begin with, but the performance and recording are both exceptional as well. Can't recommend it enough.As an aside, if you enjoy the emotive, introspective performance style exhibited here, Pieter Wispelwey's performance of Bach's Cello Suites on Channel Classics is an excellent companion to this collection."
1,re-writting history,"Allende won with only the 36% of the votes, and tried to create in the southern tip of Southamerica a new Cuba, in the cold war era.Leftwings are experts in ""adapting"" the history to their convenience. Chilean armed forces liberated Chile from Communism. The facts shall be analysed within their context, back in 1973, when the country was filled by cuban ""advisors"", training terrorist to prepare a civil war."
1,Wrong picture,"The picture that is shown is not what you get, I received what I didn't want, the pic is of the phillips safety products sb-9000 and is what I purchased over a year ago and is a superior product to the Elvex model that they sent me. I should have done my home work and looked on the bow of the pair I still have and I would have seen the web site and the model number. Just remember that the picture is wrong."
3,more details needed before purchasing,"I would like to know if subtitles, even in English were available before purchasing. For non-native speaking English person, it is not easy to understand the spoken English. Please include in the product description if movie / TV series has subtitles, translation and in which languages."
3,Middle of the Road,"I heard a sample of Stupidisco and loved the female vocals. The chorus is very catchy ""Baby Make Your Move. Step Across The Line. Touch Me One More Time. Come On Tell Me."" However, I was hopeful the rest of the album would have the feel of Stupidisco. It feel short. Honorable mentions would include: Da Hype Featuring Robert Smith, E Samba, Luv 2 U and Thrill Me. It's one of those albums where half the tracks are good and the rest - unforgettable."
3,Meh,"Derivative of Thick as a Brick, only more pompous and without nearly as many hooks. And I would say that ""The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles"" has not aged well, but I'm guessing people rolled their eyes back then."
2,Lotsa Tull fans love this one...but not me.,"I guess there is something to A Passion Play that I may be tone deaf to, but many Tull fans swear this is one fo the best. I have always found this one overly pretentious and impenetrable. Interesting in bits here and there, but for the ultimate Tull ""concept album"" go to Thick As A Brick."
4,Good Variety of Photos,"Contains many firsts, the first photograph, autochrome and digital picture. You would have seen most of the photographs in this book before, but didnt know their background. This book describes their background and in a few lines presents a look back at the World since the invention of photography."
4,Classic pics,Is definetely a very complete book. These photos may have not changed the world but they surely capture the climax of those changes.
4,Comfortable & cheap,Have to try this one. Definetively a good choice if you don't want to spend too much.
2,BEWARE OF ALLERGIC REACTION,"I applied this Cocoa Butter to a small area of my body and within three days it gave me a horrible rash ALL OVER my body. Took another week for the rash to go away and now my skin is super dry, itchy and peeling due to the rash. Not sure what ingredient in the formula is causing it as I am using a different cocoa butter lotion (Queen Helene Hand and Body Lotion) now without any problems. My blood type is A+"
1,Predictable,"Predictable after the second half hour of the movie. I usually like Michelle Laroque, but I was disappointed with this film. Bought it in France and brought it to the US. I regret spending the money in this DVD :("
4,banana holders,"I've broken a half dozen or more of the cheap plastic banana holders from Wal-Mart but no more. Got this one and it's holding up with no problems. Only thing that I would change about it would be to use a larger hook to hang the bananas from. Otherwise, this is a great product and should last. It looks great on the counter too."
2,Dated,"I purchased this collection just for the Movie ""Uncertain Glory"" directed by Raoul Walsh, which is widely considered to be one of his best, but was quite surprised at how dated Errol Flynn films had become: many special effects were shocking in their ineptitude."
4,Insightful but out of date,"The book defines several words, but many of which you never here anymore. It is funny, but helpful nonetheless."
5,"Overview, select in depth, from long term experience","I found a used copy of this a couple of nights ago and read bits of it, including the entire chapter on Jordan. I plan to read more. This is a remarkable book. Miller avoids the usual coinflip politics of most books and websites on the Arab-Israeli conflicts. She has lived in or traveled throughout the Middle East for years, and has an excellent perspective as well as information that rarely if ever make it to the surface in most writing on the subject. The book is excellent, and recommended for those who are sure they know what is going on, or those who aren't. US readers in particular would do well to drop their reading of the steady stream of novels and other fluff and learn something about the very real world in which they live, particularly since the Middle East is bound to figure in domestic politics for years to come."
5,A Fascinating Resource,"Anyone drawn to study history, culture or politics will find this book well worth the read.I was drawn by the sub-title, ""Reporting from a Militant Middle East"" because I've long felt the need to get some sort of understanding of the religious, social and political complexities to be found in the Middle East. This was the perfect book to meet that need.Miller writing style is understandable and approachable. Her commitment to detail is unwavering, and because of that, one walks away with the feeling of really having learned well what she had to teach from her 20 years of experience as a reporter in the Middle East.Finally, a single source to unravel the mysteries of so many separate and yet, connected, Islamic groups - some with influence throughout the Middle East, others that are very specific to certain cultures and countries.This book has made my list of Favorite Books of All Time."
5,"Masterful and Ancient, debunking of Christianity","A priceless refutation of both Christianity and Judaism by one of the most astute minds of the third century A.D. Mid-East. Given Christianity's indelible record of death and destruction, its refreshing to examine opposing views of the religion of Christ, from a period before the west completely succumbed to Christianity's barbarous hordes. The pagans have been so maligned in Christian literature and practice, most people are unaware of the depth of their philosophical insight and the logical clarity by which they dismantled the blind faith based Christian religion and its equally questionable parent, Judaism. Read this book and learn how an accomplished thinker of this era viewed these then revolutionary religions, as they bludgeoned and conspired their way to the dominant positions they occupy today."
3,too quiet,The alarm selection is great. Easy to use and as many alarms as you could want.The alarm itself is way too quiet. You must have it in the same room and it can't be too noisy.It is a pitifull beep beep.
4,Research,"Used this book as a resource for a research paper for my masters program. Good information, good resource good reference"
1,Out of date and not approved by the Supreme Council,"This is a reprint of the old first degree ceremonial and will not help any degree team learn what their lines are or what to do since it has changed. Save your money, only use the official degree books as outlined by Supreme."
5,Once you've read this one you'll want to read the rest.,"I have read each book and am up to 12 now, but I read this book first I Thought it was just absolutely great that I wanted to read all the rest"
5,One of the best THOROUGHBRED books ever written,"Naturally, all of the THOROUGHBRED books written by Joanna Campbell are wonderful, but this was one of the best. It left me in suspense, and was very emotional and detailed. I could relate to the characters' feelings completely because the author described how they felt using the perfect words. This book really had an effect on me. I love horses, riding, and this series! As for the person from Ohio, Cindy and Glory aren't in this book because it was published before the first Cindy book came out(this book came out in 1994 where as SHINING'S ORPHAN came out in 1995). I hope that clears things up. JOANNA, THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!"
4,"GREAT, but I have a few ??s","I think it was great that Joanna Campbell wrote this book, and I could tell. It was so much better than Karen Bently's books. But I have two questions. 1-Why in the world does Sammy not train racehorses now that she is older?? That has been her dream since we first met her!! Also, why do the Townsends own Townsend Justice, when he is out of Townsend Princess who is co-owned by Whitebrook! I can't imagine Mike letting the Townsends get Princess' offspring, especially since Ashleigh was so close to Princess!"
2,Disappointingly mediocre Ennis tale...,"Garth Ennis' work on Hellblazer is some of the best in the medium, but this trade horribly dissapoints. Any no name writer could spin this tale of John Constantine, it's suprising to see the Ennis name on it. Constantine himself loses most of what made him so cool in other Ennis works... He becomes an everyman in this book, a nobody with nothing so cool about him that someone would want to write a book about. But sadly enough, Ennis has done it, and it's a stinker."
2,"It's All About Scout, But Not Enough","It took a long time to receive this book. We were really looking forward to getting it, but were disappointed upon receipt. It does provide good pics, but not very much information. That could be because we were looking for a book with information about restoring a Scout not just one to tell us about it. Maybe we just picked the wrong book."
4,"Please Find ""Charley""","We did this as our high school play my senior year (1970) & I have never had so much fun. I fell in love with the songs & the story. I only saw the movie once on late late night TV & Ray Bolger was terrific. I would love to be able to show it to my daughter as she shares my love for musicals. Please some one, find ""Charley"" so we can all fall in love with Amy again."
2,Not Really Bamboo,"***HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE DEALER***The sheets are soft and I did not return them.... but they are not really bamboo sheets. Maybe I being to picky, and other companies I called are selling the same Viscose or Rayon from bamboo. I would advise you to do your own research on Viscose and Rayon and the production process. If you are buying them because of the environmental aspect, think again Viscose is currently becoming less common because of the polluting effects of carbon disulfide and other by-products of the process."
1,Bamboo claim is misleading,"The following is from Consumer Reports regarding ""bamboo"" sheets:Environmental claims were sometimes dubious. The Federal Trade Commission recently told 78 retailers, including Sears, whose rayon sheets we tested, to stop labeling and advertising rayon textiles as eco-friendly bamboo. Once the plant fiber is processed, it's rayon, not bamboo. Plus the processing uses toxic chemicals that emit hazardous air pollutants during manufacturing. Sheet sets we tested claim to be bamboo but should be labeled as rayon or a rayon/cotton blend.If you like this product- great. But do not be bamboozled that it is ""green""."
2,Poor Quality,My 4 year old son received this for a birthday present and was quickly frustrated with it. Very difficult to operate for a child (even we adults had some trouble). Poor quality - save your money.
2,Not for Single Mothers by Choice,"This book is good for some situations, but it is not appropriate for planned single parent families, i.e. through donor insemination or adoption. More specifically, it is designed for talking about why the man who fathered you is not here, not for talking about why I chose to start a family with you without a father."
2,bo-o-o-o-o-ring,"Wow, I feel like I read a different book than the other reviewers! I enjoy reality television and Nick Hornby, to whom comparisons have been made, but I thought this book was neither interesting nor particularly well written. While the premise is terrific, a schlump creating a more interesting character to get onto a reality show, the execution was lame. Joseph and his alter-ego Jeb are almost indistinguishable, and neither is likable (nor terribly interesting). Also, there should have been a rich stock of reality-tv stereotypes, but the people ""Jeb"" encounters are one-dimensional and too much alike. The ending is goofy and not too believable, and the book in general is too anemic even to rise to being considered angst-ridden.Just my opinion, but this was a really tedious read, and certainly not in the same league as Nick Hornby."
2,"Great subject, poor production value...","This DVD, as a documentary, is very poor - conceptually and technically. First the mundane details: It appears as a ""box set"" with 2 DVD's, but each one of them only contains 45 minutes with none of the usual ""bonus"". The film itself is very unbalanced, promising way more the it delivers and mixing solid scientific research with some very questionable messianic claims. The subject itself is fascinating. Watch the DVD if you have to, but your time would be better spent reading the original book by Michael Drosnin..."
1,The star is for the book not stories,"First there is little explaination these are RE-printed stories from other books and mags. Second I still have not stumbled on the Marion Zimmer Bradley story, a primary reason for getting this book. At least the price came down and most tales are good if you have not already read them else where."
3,Quality is free,"This is a good book as an addition to writings by Deming, Juran, Ishikawa and Ford (My Life and Work). The title is perfect because once you understand how quality really is free, you have the concept.""Quality is free"" is an essential paradigm shift for American business thinking. With it, we can recapture our place in the global economy. Without it, we will slide into obscurity.I challenge you to consider how ""Quality is Free."""
5,Waiting...,"Here we wait for season 4 of one of TV's great sitcoms, while ""That 70's Show"" is already up to season 7! Sad."
5,Rallye 4000,These bulbs really made my off road lights brighter and increase visability by about 30%. The original bulbs were halogen and visability was dull. I would recomend these to anyone thinking of replacing their rallye 4000 with a more expensive modern type of light. Saved me hundreds of $. Very satisfied for the price and quality.
4,great product,"Thank you! This product works great! I have been tanning quite a few times since applying the yellow out top coat and my french tips are still bright white! The first time product shipped, the bottle was broken, but seller sent out a new bottle right away. Great service. Thanks again! :D :D"
1,Don't get excited...,"Extremely disappointed with this product. Not only did it not remove any yellowing from the nail, it actually provided a yellow-tinted shine. Don't waste your money! If you need yellow out, soak in clorox for 5 minutes...done."
2,hasn't done anything for me yet,My toenails are very yellow because I constantly keep polish on them. I've only been using this product and no actual nail polish for a couple of weeks now and there has been no improvement. Maybe it just takes a while. I'll keep using it and see what happens. I guess I was expecting more of a miracle worker.
5,Great entertainment.,I got this for my teen-age sons to watch. They both loved it. They have watched the whole thing. No complaints.
5,Get your Swiss Army knife ready!,"Who else wants a Swiss Army knife just because of MacGyver? This second season includes the introduction of Mac's bitter enemy Murdock and his wild and crazy friend Jack Dalton. Mac's quick wit and unquenchable optimism is as sharp as ever, and his adventures are always interesting (if not sometimes a bit bizarre). The episodes included in this season are:1.

4,It's old school,"It's a classic old film and a great addition to any bassfishermans collection. I am sure if it was shot in HD and had a different VO artist the film would look great and come off a little less cheesy, but it's 30 years old. It does go deep into the study of the bass species and can be a great tool for anglers of all ages."
4,Great read,I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and kept me interested the whole way through. It has great christian views and the love story in it is good too. I can't wait to read the second book.
3,Enjoyed it but....,This was a great concert & the video is fun. So many great songs...However the sound quality is terrible. You can barely hear her over the music.My daughter loves it though and she plays it over & over!I'd recommend this only to a real fan who can see past the flaws & enjoy the show.
1,DO NOT BUY UN-MUSIC!,"I was there, when Avril was being INVENTED! She does not write her songs, an entire team does. This is not music. We destroyed Milli Vanilli because they were fakes but spare all these young pretty girls and guys. The last REAL music came in the early 80's. That is why there are no Legends under 43 years old. I have been in the Music Industry since 1975 and I can say with assurance, ""Rock is Dead"". Buy Elvis or Annie Lennox, Robert Plant or Cheap Trick....at least you will get real talent who deserve our money and attention. If you think this is Avril's only fake, just go to any of her concerts. She can barely sing on key or remember lyrics. Avril is a special effect like K.Reeves in ""The Matrix"", not real like Bruce Lee (look ma, no wires!). Sad, Sad, Sad!"
5,One of the best books I have read!,"I had not previously heard of this author, but I must say he is sure to be one of the best. This book is moving and wonderful. It is well written and the characters become members of the reader's family as this well written novel is read. You should know that although it is listed as paperback, it is actually a large softcover book of high quality. I consider the money I spent as money truly well spent."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"THIS PRODUCT HAS BUGS WHICH MAKES IT CRASH. THERE IS A PATCH AVAILABLE V1.1.0.5, BUT IT REQUIRES A PRIOR PATCH WHICH IS UNAVAILABLE. THERE IS NO FIX AND ATARI WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS ITEM. DO NOT BUY"
2,"So Fast, that you may finish before you start.","I bought this DVD expecting a series of step by step tutorials on Matte Painting. What I got was a very talented and accomplished artist speed teaching Matte Painting concepts. As best I can figure the video speed was increased by ~3x in order to fit all the contents on one DVD. The audio track is at normal speed, but most of the painting is done in full screen mode so its impossible to see the work flow. Occasionally you can see what option was set, or setting was clicked but most of the time you can't. Had this DVD came out of warp into sub-light speed, and showed work flow, I would have given it five stars."
5,"Heavy boots, good for smashing holes in doors.","I work in a coal plant, so I needed some real heavy duty boots. These boots do the job and more. Was mad the other night and threw one at my wood front door...straight through. Caterpillar makes some heavy boots...thats a fact."
3,Kickboxing,"It was an awesome workout, I really saw a difference in my workout after a finished the video."
3,"A worthwhile story, despite qualms","The saga kept me reading to the end, but the book ends poorly while failing to deal with several key aspects of the aftermath.For example, the author states that murder convictions in Michigan are followed by a mandatory appeal. Aside from pointing out this fact, there is not so much as a word about any appeals that may have happened.Also, a major theme throughout this work was witness intimidation. After the story is more or less wrapped up, a detective suggests that there were additional witnesses to the murder who remain vulnerable. There is no follow up on this. For some reason, the author chose to devote the final chapters to a couple of homicides that had no connection to the case except that they were worked by the same detective and prosecutor.Although this awkward ending left me bitter, the allure of the story was gripping, given my northern Michigan roots, and I would recommend it to fans of the genre or fellow Michiganders."
3,Love Potion 69,"Not to be confused with another group out of San Antonio, also called the Outcasts, these guys were your basic garage band circa 1968, doing covers of Louie Louie, Satisfaction, Hang On Sloopy and Love Potion #9, (or Love Potion 69, at least that's the way I remember it). Hailing from Manhasset, Long Island, (my hometown) I have vivid recollections of seeing The Outcasts at church dances, battle of the bands and their one big TV performance on Son Fox's Wonderama. Their only single, You'd Be Surprised/Set Me Free is included on this colection. The balance is culled together from live unreleased material."
2,Didn't really get it...,"I didn't really ""get"" this book. I think it just went in too many directions. Everybody was cheating on everybody; Chris had committed suicide, leaving Elizabeth in a state of depression; Nate wanted to leave Elizabeth for Lesje who was trying to leave her boyfriend who eventually assaulted her...I just didn't get it. I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to a more interesting book."
1,too big and gaudy,i thought this was too big and too ostentatious for me. I like fine and simple elegance. this looked like something from Tuesday Morning.
4,Enjoyable mystery,"Never Tease a Siamese (Leigh Koslow Mystery Series)is an entertaining mystery. The core characters are likable and varied. Leigh can't resist a good mystery! She has a knack for showing up at the scene of a murder. The plot is well paced and kept me reading. It had good logic and some nice twists. At one point, Leigh misses an obvious clue and makes a dumb move. Not so glaring that I hold it against her. The cats were a nice touch, and even played a credible role in the plot.The writing was excellent and the Kindle edition was mostly glitch-free. It was a pleasure to read a mystery, for a change, that was not heavy on gore, profanity, and sex.I've enjoyed the whole series and recommend it. At about $3, the book was a great bargain, too."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I very rarely stop reading a book in the middle, but this one gives you little reason to see it through. The characers are so poorly developed that each time I picked up the book, I would totally forget what was happening, and have to read two pages back. Don't waste your money. If you like the series, go to the library."
4,Great historical fiction!,"A great deal on a wonderful book dealing with integration in the 50s. The fictional Mary Ellis follows her lifelong dream to attend nursing school not at the historically black nursing school she plans on, but in a new integrated setting."
2,What the heck???,"Jeez, this was awful to have to listen to from beginning to end. 2 stars for effort, but that's it. Blues from the soles of your feet would be a more apt title. Sorry, this is a stinker."
1,What a let down !,"WOW ! I can`t believe I actually dropped $33.00 on this DVD. I should have known because most of Ministry`s products are commercial and chessy. I just ordered 6 DVD`s from Amazon and this is by far the worst. Total rip-off. If you want to see a great DVD, pick up the ATB or the Tiesto. This is the last time i`m buying anything with the Ministry logo on it."
1,Not what I expected,"The number one problem I had with this DVD, was the fact that there is no narration. Not the mention the terrible image quality and sound problems."
2,intolerable characters,"I really gave this one a shot. I wanted a fun, light read, and it was kinda that... The storyline was rather predictable, but that wasn't my problem.I just really couldn't stand the characters- they were both self-absorbed and more than a little arrogant."
3,A solid effort on Failie Arrow's part.,"Gidday, Gidday. Here's the scoop. I enjoyed Fairlie's workout on the basis that she has a lot of knowledge on the art of kickboxing and some other martial arts. The production, however, is a little weak. Her movements were great and the routines were superb, however, I found that this video lacked the proper cooldown needed to prevent blood-pooling after an intense workout such as which. The workout stopped abruptly. Otherwise, a solid workout that can get results."
3,west coast swing,"I bought this some time ago, Shawn does a good job, but as a dancer I have always felt that the explanation's should only come from one instructor.If you listen too both parties, the instruction loses focus"
4,"Packaging looked different, but it works","I ordered this product based on the fact that the package in the picture looked the same as what I've had before. When I recieved the product the packaging looked different and said Nite White Zoom instead of Excel 3. The package was a clear case not black and green, but the ACP and 16% matched on the package description. It seems to be doing the job (used it for 5 nghts and my teeth look nice and white.)"
2,Whiting gel for use with trays,"I did not receive the product I ordered!! They sent me a similar type product, but not the Brand I ordered. I ordered the brand prescribed by my dentist which worked great which is why I ordered it. I felt this was a bait & switch. Amazon should remove this merchant !!!"
1,Nite White Excel 3 ACP Z 16% Teeth Whitening 3pk Kit,"This product is fake and it does not work! I've purchased the same product from a different web site before and it worked very well. In my opinion, this product is 100% fake and I would not recommend it to anyone! Waste of money!!!"
5,Mine worked fine,"I bought mine for 10 bucks at Rite Aid drug store yesterday. I have only used it for the TV(not cable etc...) and it has worked fine so far. I set it on the window sill next to my bed where the original remote will not set because it is to big. I may velcro a strip to the wall and remote for even more ""ease of use"".I also plan to use it mischieviously at some point.The cashier at Rite Aid said they sold out at Christmas and restocked only after ""months"" and they display them at the check-out area because they are so popular."
3,Didn't work at first...,"Like other reviewers, I'm pretty tech-savvy. My remote wouldn't program at all - you're supposed to press TV or Cable for 3 seconds, until the buttons stay lit, and then search for the code. Well, the buttons on mine never stay lit, so I can't program it. A waste of $$$. Customer service from the company that makes this remote is non-existent.December 2009 Update: I finally figured out that if I replaced the battery with a fresh one, I could get it to work just fine. However, I think that the product should have been shipped with a fresh battery to begin with, and the company should include some troubleshooting suggestions with the remote. Poorly designed, extremely tiny, very basic instructions are all that's included."
3,Great for the elderly or anyone who has trouble with universal remotes,"A very simple and easy-to-use universal remote. Great for anyone who struggles with a TV and a separate set-top box such as a converter box, cable box, or satellite receiver; and who can't get the hang of two remotes or other more complex universal remotes. You can just set it up and hand it to them!If you don't want it on a keychain, put it on a lanyard instead."
5,A gift for my granddaughter,She picked this out as one of the gifts she wanted and I know she will enjoy it very much.
5,Don't need to be a surfer,"I've never surfed before, but I do enjoy Jack's music. I must say that this is a very relaxing film, with nice footage. I reccomend the product to ALL JJ fans, not only surfers. Songs flowed nicely. JJ fans must buy!"
2,Not enough Jack,"The few songs by Jack on this CD aren't as good as what has been on his other CDs (Between Dreams, On and On, Brushfire Fairytales and Curious George). Not a big fan of the other songs. And the On and On version of Holes to Heaven is much better."
3,Nice Corset yet,This corset isnt as long as its advertised to be i put iot on and realized it only goes about to your belly button and in the picture it looks way longer it doesnt give much breast support Its still very pretty though So if you dont need much breast support and dont mind the length i would say its ok
5,BRILLIANT!!,"The story of Lana and Jason will go down in the history books. Allisa McVea is truly a talented author. By the time you reach the end of this book, there will be no questions as to what next. I feel as if I've been liberated and have the ability to see twenty years out, the lives of the characters.Allisa McVea, thank you for bringing such a well thought out novel. I am a White Female and I read every page and have not one complaint.I hope to see more from you."
2,Not at all like the book...,I just finished reading The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. What an amazingly written piece of literature. I wish I could say the same for the screen play of the same name. The movie itself is tolerable but should have not carried the title of the literary work. The same names were used in the movie but that is where the comparison ends.There is a very telling human story that evolves in the book - it is universal and it is raw. It can not be compromised or the story (and the impact of the title) can not be told.Arkin does a good job acting as a deaf-mute [let's face it - he has no dialogue - that's a challenge for any actor] but he does not depict the deaf-mute known as Mister Singer in the written word.
3,"Good movie, Great Book","This is a good movie. Alan Arkin is magnificent, and every other actor in the film is at least very good. There are great scenes, important messages, basic humanity - well portrayed with all its evil and all its glory.It is not ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.""The movie's focus is on one relationship, the one between John Singer and Mick Kelly. It almost ignores important characters like Biff Brannon, whose character is ever present in the novel, and turns Jake Blount's character into a bit part. The movie takes extraordinary, and unnecessary, liberties with the many plots and relationships.Advice to buyers: If you have neither read the book nor seen the movie, watch the movie first - that way you won't be disappointed by it. If you have seen the movie but not read the book, read the book. Its reputation is well deserved, and you'll probably read it again some day. If you've read the book, and are considering watching the movie: Don't."
5,Gourmet dinner,My cat who is 18 years old and a fussy eater loves this food. I used to buy it at Pet Smart but for some reason they don't sell it anymore. I called all the shops in the area and also looked online but couldn't find it. Luckily I found it at Amazon. It was delivered on time and my cat never missed a meal. I give it 5 stars because it is my cat's favourite food.
1,Not for actually helping you choose wine,"The entire book is about wine but actually nothing useful in helping you pick one. The book concentrates on details of aging, fermentation, barrel size but no actual wine suggestions. I needed help on picking a wine to serve with dinner. I don't care how large the barrels are its aged in, and it included a diary of their wine traveling adventures. What?! Who cares about 2 dudes traveling and drinking? I'll watch Bill and Ted's Adventures if I want that. There are a lot more useful books on the market than this one."
4,"Really comfortable, but the color is not what it looks in the picture","The shoe is comfortable, but the color is completely different than the one shown in the picture."
1,Made in Taiwan / Doesn't work out of the box,"I thought that if I go all out and spend [...] bucks for a pump, it would work well and last a long time. This is nearly as shoddy as the $[...] pump I bought earlier this month. What do you have to do to get something that works? Unbelievable. Just tried to use it and now instead of having underinflated tires, my tires are totally flat."
5,This game is sick,"I love this game it is so fun.It's hard but,you can get a sniper, demolition man,spy,driver,marine,and a diver.You can set to fire oil,use artilery,drive tanks,blow up bridges,baracks and tanks.here's a tip if you have the game get behind a wall and start firing your pistols if a group comes over to were you shot then [shoot them]."
2,"Rather dull, but worth it to see La Loren as a blonde","""Heller in Pink Tights"" is not one of Sophia Loren's best (it's kind of boring, actually) or best-known offerings, but it's certainly worth a look, if only to see what she looks like as a blonde. I don't think she quite works as an Old West entertainer, though. If you're looking for late-1800's/early-1900's period pieces starring Sophia, I think ""A Breath of Scandal"" is a much better bet."
4,A total thumbs up... if you don't lose things really easily.,"I bought a pair of these JVC earbuds around last Christmas, and they were the best pair of headphones I'd ever had. They had a great sound; were very comfortable; and actually stayed in my ears (which is always a plus), unlike the Apple headphones.My favorite thing about these headphones is the fact that the cords are different lengths. This lets you wrap the longer one around the back of your neck, keeping the cords out of your way, for the most part, if you bend over or anything.My only problem with these was how easily the earbud covers (the little rubber bits) come off after a while, which makes them extremely easy to lose. They come with a smaller and a larger pair of covers, and by now, I've lost one cover from each pair... which unfortunately renders my earbuds pretty much useless."
3,Give me the Dad face,"This story had ecsaped my attention until recently. I rented it, thinking it had to be decent, given the casting. I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing.The story is relatable and moving. Anton Yelchin gives a stirring performance as a child dealt a difficult hand, struggling to make his own way. Tea Leoni plays very well the role of a distraught, widowed mother who has been left to care for her son. I feel the role of Pappas (played by Robin Williams) could have been slightly more developed, but he turns in a wonderful performance. David Duchovny wrote and directed the movie, as well as acted as the present day version of the main character.It's not the most engaging movie, but it is interesting. It has its moments of humor, sadness and happiness. Altogether a good effort by Duchovny."
3,Bonheur!,"I enjoyed this film, though it came together very awkwardly. Téa Leoni and Anton Yelchin gave great performances, but David Duchovny and Robin Williams were mediocre at best. Not their shining moments in front of the camera. Erykah Badu was great in her role of Lady. I do admire Duchovny's vision behind the camera, though. The film was a bit more art house than I care for, but it worked. In an existential sort of way, the mechanics of the film were really secondary to the boy's story, which managed to be intense and not sentimental. I can cite all the things about the film that weren't there, but because it still came together so well, clearly its strength lay on other levels. That indicates to me that Duchovny is a bright writer and director."
2,average Movie,I thought this film tries to take on so much.I just recently saw it&there was so much happening&I don't think things got a fair chance at fully developing to me.this film has alot of drama ups&downs. I just couldn't really feel this fim fully for some reason or another.
1,this books sux my balls........literally,...the only good thing about it is that it has Edge in it...
5,Super Movie,"This was an awesome ""guy"" film. 4 elements made it stand out as such. 1) The main characters were Pam Grier and Margeret Markov. Two very attactive women. 2) There was constant action throughout the movie. Even a couple of catfights. 3) Of course it wouldn't be a guy film without tons of unnecessary nudity. Both Grier and Markov have full frontial shots! 4)But to top it off, it's not like you're sitting though a bunch of mindless scenes just to see Grier and Markov. Rather this film has a really great storyline. The plot is believable (except for maybe one scene) and the message really touches your heart. It's a great film worth owning. and if you like it you should check out..""Black Mama, White Mama""..not nearly as good but has it's moments."
5,Kirk Whalum-smooth jazz's only redeeming saxophonist!,"This album is way overdue and shows the full range of Kirk's abilities. Passion, grace, and fire are all words that describe this cd, from the haunting rendition of ""Lord, I want to be a Christian"", the beautiful lilting 6/8 feel of ""Blessed Redeemer"", and the duet with vocalist and brother Kevin Whalum ""Wade in the Water"" is a delightful funky romp. The cd features incredible solo's from pianist George Duke and guitarist Paul Jackson, jr. and Kirk could not have picked a better pairing for this live album done at Nashville's Ryman auditorium in front of church folk and musicians alike. Buy this one, you'll be glad you did!"
5,A Wonderful 'Inspired' Gospel/Jazz CD,"Gospel According to Jazz, Chapters 1 & 2, are outstanding projects. Kirk is an anointed artist, without a doubt.The DVD of Chapter 2, is WONDERFUL! Artists like JonathanButler/Ta-Ta Vega, Kirk's brother, Kevin/George Duke/Paul Jackson, Jr. & Kirk's son, Kyle -- add a specialtouch."
4,A BEAUTIFUL MUSICAL EXPERIENCE,"Praise the Lord for jazz musicians who love to serve Him! Kirk Whalum and George Duke are to be commended for this effort; their performances are almost hypnotic. The choir is adequate, but the musicians steal the show on this one. NICE WORK KIRK!"
1,Disappointing...,"This does not have the version of Into The West SUNG by Annie Lennox, so buyer beware."
2,Undergraduate?,"Just once, I'd like to pick up a math text that delivers the basics up-to and including the point of the book. This ""undergraduate"" book requires prior knowledge and didn't work for me as a self-teach, even with my 5-semesters of calculus. Very disappointed."
1,couldn't get traction,I tried to stay with this book. But it moves very slowly with too much extraneous detail. The characters weren't compelling enough for me to stick with it.
3,Not as impressed as the everyone else.,"This is my third Lescroart novel and I have yet to embrace it like I did my first Guilt. That is not to say that this is a bad book. I did like it but not nearly as much.Part of my problem was that I really did not care for the characters. I think Lescroart has a great skill in creating believable people and story lines, it's just that the people are not always people you like or are interested in what happens to them.The only other fault I had with The 13th Juror was that it was not exciting a trial and the resolution came to Dismas a little to easily at the end. All this tension and then and worry and then he figures it out all of a sudden. Not that the reader could not have come to the same conclusion, but you sit there thinking, it can't be that simple. Yes, it can.Still, I have read far worse. I still reccomend Guilt."
4,interesting legal thriller,"that seemed realistic . . . in particular, i felt the court scenes were quite realistic."
4,Two reviews in one,"I really feel this book should be reviewed in two parts. The first half of the book (before the trial opens) is rather slow and I was left wondering if the story would ever get off the ground. However, the second half of the book is everything a great legal thriller should be and I found myself unable to tear myself away from it. The ending comes as a surprise and yet pulls all the loose ends together beautifully. The suspense does not let up and proceeds at an every-quickening pace. Re-edit the first half of the book and I would give it 5 stars."
5,Another winner,Lescroart is one of my favorite authors. He has created characters that are realistic and engaging and his plots keep you guessing to the very end. The Hardy series and the Hunt series are truly entertaining and keep the reader turning pages. His descriptions of people and settings are rich and almost place the reader there with the characters. An excellent read.
3,"A good textbook, if not so many mistakes in exercise problems",I feel that the author did not pay much attention to the exercises at the end of each chapter... Quite a few mistakes.
1,It's Not In English,"Be sure you know, that before you order Brad Meltzer's book, that it is NOT in English. This is the origianl ""Dead Even""."
4,uh it does say language: french,"i didn't buy this book, i have the english version cuz that's all i know, but i just noticed that it does say under product description--language: french. maybe they should star that though"
3,Not as Good as the First Trilogy,"Like many, I fell in love with Griffin and Sabine in the first series. The romance of their relationship was unmatched, even before they met. Their letters are amazing and I loved the voyeuristic quality of reading their letters and postcards.However, in the Gryphon, I felt cheated somehow, as though Bantock were simply trying to find a way to capitolize on the success of the first series by continuing the story. As for the link between the two, I found it to be less than beleivable. While I enjoyed the intense passion between Isabella and Matthew, I never felt the link between them and Griffin and Sabine. I thought it lacked any feeling of the bond that was conveyed betweem Griffin and Sabine in the first series.Again, the letters, postcards and artwork are beautiful and I loved the format of the story, however, I had some issues with the content."
3,Foretrex 201,"I bought this GPS to use for walking and bike riding. Where I live it is very slow to react to changes. I have yet to make contact witht the 12 satellites as advertized, at best I can get 6. The elevation is extremely inaccurate. I live at about 3400 feet and can get readings from 3200 feet up. Several instances while I have been walking up an incline the elevation has actually gone down. For distances it appears to be extremely accurate."
3,Too bad,"I bought both this screen and the green plastic screen that substitutes for a mason jar lid. This screen works better in that you can fill and empty easily...no sprouts leak through...water goes right through the lid full force...excellent for rinsing sprouts. But, after only a week some rust started to appear at the edges of the screen under the lid. Too bad it's not treated or of a material to resist rust. The green lid is plastic, no rust. But you have to unscrew it each time to fill the jar with water and put the lid back on to pour the water out."
4,"good cd, great band","This band is awesome and all the songs are awesome but the the bloody cd is too short. Anyway, I think the music is great as are the lyrics , though at little hard to undersatnd at times, hence the reason theres lyric sites. Buy this album along with...Dying Fetus- Infatuation with malevalenceCradle Of Filth-(anything will do its all awesome)Emporer- (anything really, it all sounds good)"
1,Where is the test??,"I purchased the kindle edition. It keeps refering to your BCII score, but I have no way of taking it. Why would they sell a kindle edition and not provide a way to take the test? This is very frustrating.."
2,Violence breeds violence,"Bleak account of how a violent childhood determines the life of small town cop Nick Nolte. Short on sentiment and a little slow, the film is, nevertheless, watchable and a reasonably effective indictment of child abuse. Nolte delivers a surpisingly intense performance and James Coburn oozes malice as his despicable father."
5,Best slide I ever had. It's great for lap steel or upright.,This is a physically heavy slide. If lap steel or dobro it's irrelevant. Upright it's a little heavy but that's what I like about it. Heavier than a metal slide. Sounds really cool.
4,Decent stuffed animal,"I actually bought this as part of a graduation present for a friend. It has soft fur and is a good size, and it easily sits upright. My only complaint is that when it does sit upright, its head tilts up a lot more than the picture would make it appear. The eyes also do not look exactly the same as the picture. To me, the picture makes it look kind of like the panda has black tears, but the actual product does not have that and the eyes look normal.There are better ones out there, but for the price it's not bad if it's what you're looking for."
4,Only a 4 because I rarely give 5s,"I'd say this is more of a 4 and half but since thats not possible, a 4 will do. Wow. That's what I said the first time I heard this cd. This is killer gind that won't stop crushing you until the cd is over. My favorite track on here is Trojan Whore, because of the killer grooves they get going. This cd always puts a smile on my face when I listen to it and if you're anything like me, don't hesitate to buy this, just do it right now."
4,Beware chapter 4,"With one flaw, this is a very good book.McArthur's discussion of Fritz Lang's classic film noir begins quite strongly, with a discussion of the source novel. (Which was written by a man who would later help write the original Kojak TV series.) Mc Arthur then gives details about the filming, and how The Big Heat was originally received, and how it is currently considered.Then in Chapter 4, the book goes off the rails. McArthur had written of The Big Heat in a book published in the early 70s. He uses Chapter 4 to trace the development of British film criticism, which he sees as first poisoned by elitism and now by an academic obscurantism. The reader sees his point, but this is hardly the place to deal with this issue.Chapter 5 is a terrific examination of the film, looking at what Fritz Lang brought to its realization, but the excitement of the earlier part of the book has been lost.Overall, a good, but flawed, entry in the BFI series."
4,A last word from a faithful Episcopal priest,"A Scornful Wonder was written by The Rev. Dr. C. Leslie Glenn right before his death and right before the Episcopal Church departed its historic Via Media, centered between Catholic and Protestant; Conservative and Liberal; and descended into hellish left wing Revisionism. ""A Scornful Wonder"" is full of stories of wisdom, charity and love that the best priests gather like flowers during their earthly ministry. It is a brief summary of Dr. Glenn's theology. It is not groundbreaking or original. That is part of its charm. It is the last word of a faithful Episcopal priest who served his church well. If Dr. Glenn were here today, I am sure he would be shocked by the lawsuits and schisms and scandals that have plagued the Episcopal Church since it has departed from orthodox teaching and practice. If you want to experience what the Episcopal Church was like before it plunged over the edge, this is an excellent reminder."
3,Purpose missed,"Alas, in the majority of modern cars (German, japanese, French) the cigarette lighter (where this device plugs in) is not powered when the ignition key is removed. So the devices flashes all right when the driver is in the car and they contact is on. Completely misses the purpose of protection."
2,"Wrong turn, guys.","I really didin't like this one. It didn't contain any of the thunderous drums and bass characterised by previous Steve Albini productions.And worse of all, the guys attempt harmonizing with each other on this. I listened to this twice and then sold it back."
3,"Some interesting points, but a lot left unsaid or ignored","Actually, the statistics are what I found most interesting in the book. The author seemed to feel that all the problems that women and the military are having are due to sexism. Other issues, such as the very high attrition rates of women, the much higher injury and disability rates, the much lower availability etc etc are all put down to some sort of sexism. Politically correct, but unfortunately a lot of untruths and truths not stated."
2,Bob Ross - Getting Started with Oil Colors,"I was quite disappointed with this tape. Almost half the tape is just a promotion of the products that Bob Ross has on the market. It started out okay with the basics of oil painting, but he doesn't even start and finish one painting. I would not recommend this to anyone. The sad thing is that Bob Ross was such a talented artist. I guess I'll try and buy one of the other tapes that he advertises on the one that I bought."
3,A bit disappointing,"It is a good book. But The preposition section is a bit lacking. Eg. Unit 16 Common Prepositions - I actually expected more explanation of the ""one-word"" prepositions. All that was there was a list of the ""other"" prepositions with their translations. Some words have more than one meaning depending on the context. Eg. ""Pendant"" can mean ""during"" or ""for"". There could be more explanation. I RECOMMEND ""The Ultimate French Review and Practice"". It covers and explains a bit more."
4,"Very cute, small children may be afraid of the avalanche/snowball in the ""YETI"" episode","My 3-yr-old daughter loves the Backyardigans. Both shows are very cute and have great music. One thing to note is that in the ""YETI"" episode there is an avalanche and a large snowball rolls down after the kids. My daughter started crying when this happened and thought they were going to be hurt. It took her over a week to get past this and realize they're ok. Other than that, both episodes are great."
5,OMG The taking is absolute genius,"Dean Koontz you scared the daylights out of me with this book and I enjoyed ever second. By the time I was done I was so jumpy at nearly everything that moved in a good way of course. It made me think how precious life really is and how important it is to live our lives caring about each other. How many times do we ever really actually consider what hell would be like. Well this book gave me a good idea of what hell would be and what in a way what it means to live without a soul when reading about the aliens. Then when it comes to the Sloan couple, the children and even the animals, glad you added cats, I see the spirit goes with the soul. Well that's part of what I got out of it. I truly enjoyed this book it really got to me.BTW I think I saw the part where the people who's faces were taken away on TV years ago. I remember a lot of it was fuzzed out because it was on regular TV. Was this story or part of it at some point in time a movie????"
2,"Apparently, an awful choice for my first DK book","Turning a metaphor once in a while is good prose. Continuous languid twist of verbiage in a trite, ridiculous, pseudo-religion-freak, self-indulgent pretense of poetry-a-la King (Steven) is a little over the top. This book is so bad it's humorous. Now I need someone to convince me to purchase any other DK novel.While my usual (historical non-fiction) can be impassionate and light on creativity, it beats mindless, pointless, woeful musings of the human endeavor as related by what must certainly be identified as an under-developed, mal-adjusted, forcibly female point of view. Why else would the audio book publisher adopt an untrained female reader to help destroy this production? I was undecided as to which was more catastrophic. The book or the poignant example of what happens when an author signs a multi-book contract with his publisher...."
2,What a stupid closing chapter!!!!,"Koontz has some classics and some clunkers. This is a BIG clunker!! The first half of the book is very good. However, the deal with Molly's father never made sense. The big bugs never made sense. The TS Eliot parts are ridiculous. The fungi? Please give me a break. However, the closing chapter in which she writes the ""memorized"" alien quote, (C'mon, how could she remember word for word something she heard in an alien language????) in the sand and then is able to ""translate"" it is so stupid I could not believe it. I cringe even now as I write about it. What a dumb ending to what could have been a very good book, (without the bugs, the fungus, the father, the doll, the Scandanavian kids, the alien quote, you get the idea)."
3,Not what I expected....,"This one was by far the ""wildest"" one yet from Dean Koontz...in my opinion. It starts out like a typical Koontz story but then all of a sudden, you're reading about alien vegetation life and fungus....Not what I expected. I did enjoy the book though since it's a nice change from what you normally would expect from his stories. Change is good once in while! The only thing that sort of bothered me was that the only people spared were based on what they did as a profession-I'm sure the reason was to rebuild life with ""better"" people, but that does not mean just because of what they did for a living mean that they are ""better"" people. I would've prefered if the people spared were because of some gifted sense that they had no control over. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book!"
1,Can this honestly be the same Dean Koontz?,"I just finished The Taking. What a waste. I mourn not the money spent on this book, but the time expended in wallowing through it. I honestly though Intensity was one of the scariest books I ever read. Excellent. This however, almost appears to have been written by some other, lame writer, under his name.Aside from characters who were so unappealing that I honestly hoped they'd all be done away with, the monsters here were silly beyond words. And I was floored by how many needlessly large words were used that only a few linguists would even begin to understand. This actually appeared to me to be a novice writer (not someone so acclaimed) who was trying to show off their vocabulary. In short, I thought this book stunk, and don't waste your time or money on it."
2,Descending deeper into the macabre.,"I picked up this book with the slight hope that he would return to his glory days with books like Watchers, Strangers and Lightning. His writing used to be a mix of genres, but for a long time now, it has strictly been very dark horror."
2,"Just not there, perhaps taken. . .","If you are looking for classic Dean Koontz with his ability to create memorable characters and events that you just love, pass on this book! Dean has slipped a bit from the norm. Perhaps he was ""taken"" with nostalgia for his older science fiction works. This book reminds me of his early sci-fi books like ""The Fall of the Dream Machine"". Don't go there either! Oh, and Dean, please give us more books like ""Odd Thomas""!"
2,"Some good ideas, poor execution","I always look forward to Koontz' new releases. This one looked interesting from the jacket summary. The idea of aliens that think of us as gnats, terraforming our world and how they were going about it was a great idea to be explored. But it wasn't. It turned into yet more dogs again help save the humans from the minions of hell (literally). If the last few chapters w/the in-your-face religious moralizing were removed the book would be better. If ANY other ending was put in their place this would be MUCH better. As others have said, don't waste your money...this will soon be on the Borders bargain rack. The text is also off-putting. At times it seemed that he was trying to see how many archaic, poly-syllabic words he could fit into a sentence. If you want to read some good Koontz, grab Odd Thomas, From the Corner of His Eye, The Face, Phantoms, or just about anything else. This is one of his worst. Right there w/False Memory in my book."
1,we have to save the children...,"Like so many horror writers out there, Dean fell into this horrible cliche. ""We have to save the children."" there have been no child characters up to this point, but suddenly, the plot shifts to ""we have to save the children."" This is disgusting garbage. This book started out with a good idea, followed up with some disturbing imagery (which is a good thing in a horror book) then fell flat on its face with the stupid ""we have to save the children"" tripe that comes from out of nowhere and is sentimental garbage. I was having fun with it, but couldnt finish the book due to this annoying plot cliche. If this is all you have left, dean, its time to retire."
2,At least the cover art was okay,"This book starts with wonderful imagery and builds tension quickly. However, it soon becomes a repetitive morass of warmed-over Stephen King coupled with Koontz' annoying fascination with preternatural dogs and a murky religious consciousness that bogs the story down even more. Just to make it murkier, he has developed a passion for purple prose that makes third-rate romance novels read like Shakespeare. Definitely my last Koontz book."
3,It doesn't feel like Koontz,"A big fan of Koontz, I've been reading his novels for 15 years. I even enjoy his new books, but The Taking doesn't even feel like Koontz wrote it. It lacks his charm, personality, and humor. Not only that, but the grammar does not fit his style. It's as if he hired someone else to write it for him.I don't see the reason in explaining the story, as so many reviewers did a fine job of that. The story is enjoyable, I guess, but it's not Koontz. Even the ending was clever.The bottom line is, if you are expecting this novel to feel like Koontz, then you can pass it up. Although, it is different from other things he has written, different enough from other stories out there like it, that it is worth reading."
2,Just Didn't Make Sense,"There are many drawn out events in this book that are creepy and really seem utterly implausible. Combined together, these events give this book a pointless feel. I always like it when the characters have to challenge their assumptions about themselves and go through a transformation. With such a huge end of the world happening, some character change would seem to have to happen. The book just moves along pointlessly from one hard to image event to the next."
1,Lacking in so many areas...,"I have been a fan of Mr. Koontz for many years. I have to say this is the furthest thing from Midnight and Strangers you could Imagine.The story starts with a spooky rain, but degenerates into isolated encounters peiced together with a vague alien invasion theme.The problem is in the ""why"". Why do the invaders do any of the things they do? There isn't really an answer.Mr. Koontz also seems to recycle the same romantic dialogue that seemed out of place in the better Odd Thomas. DO people really talk like this? Go and re-read Lightling before this one."
2,No thanks.,"I've been a Koontz fan for many years - some of his books I've absolutely loved, and some have been a little disappointing, but this is one of his weakest works by far. It's a long story that drags on and on with LOADS of narrative (zzzzz) and over-the-top adjectives that make even an English major's head spin. The ending seems like a cheap and easy out - I guess even HE got tired of the story. Why not just stick a red bow on the cover so readers can tie up this lame story in a nice little package without having to endure reading this overly-long tale."
2,wow - worst koontz book ever,"After the first hour I wanted to just put it down and walk away. I should have. It doesn't get any better and the more I go on, the more I am just grateful that I listen to these books while I drive and therefore, am not really waisting my time.I usually like Koontz books even the more sci-fi ones but this just sucked"
3,Another Koontz Novel,I found the story line to be similar to most of his other novels. It sells books but is not especially entertaining. Koontz needs to find a different theme.
3,Great book up until the ending,"I must say that I absolutely loved this book...up until the ending. I couldn't put it down. I was reading it every night before I went to bed and I was scared out of my wits to turn off the light. I thought the story was very intriguing and couldn't wait to see how he wrapped it all up. Then when I noticed there were only around 30 pages left I started to get this sinking feeling that there was no way he would be able to wrap up the storyline to my satisfaction. Boy was I right..the ending was a total ripoff. I don't even think half of the book makes since when you take his final explanation into context. I am a big Koontz fan, and though I am diasappointed by the ending, I still enjoyed the book."
1,The Taking,"I have always been a Dean Koontz fan, but this book was like watchng a movie and seeing commercials for T.S, Elliot. This was written like a screen play by Bentley Little, where the end came very soon,It seems that he was in a hurry to finish this book.At most it should have been a paper back as he once started.I hope he will get back on track and write with more than a deadline. I am always an avid reader of his work this one just dissappointed me..."
1,Get out your thesauruses,"OH MY!!!!!!!! If you can get through reading a book that uses words like expatriates and susurration than you get credit. This book was trying to show his use of descriptive words. Horrible. If you can get past that then try such phrases as ""fear suckled"" Koontz has really done a hatch job this time"
3,Short and suspenseful but not one of his best.,The suspense in this short novel is intense but Koontz's characters in The Taking are unremarkable (more so than usual) and the revelations seem far from logical. A story on this theme should have been much more thoughtful.
1,"zero stars, negative five stars.","I had open beart surgery two months ago and I have been desperate for reading material. Koontz is always a reliable read, so I whipped ""The Taking"" off the shelf without my usual perusal before buying.YUCK!Suspense? Not really. So many heavy-handed clues, fore-shadowings and religious flavorings, so much purple prose wondering how advanced aliens could be so evil---THEY AREN""T ALIENS IT""S SATAN, this book is part of the ""Left Behind"" genre!Hope I've saved you from reading the book.BTW, the narrative style is really cloying, third person narration telling us what the protagonist is thinking/obsessing about.If you like ""Revenge of the Sith"" you'll probably like this one.BAD!"
1,From Science Fiction to Bible Fiction at the End,"OK, I'll admit a lot of this book was kinda cheesy but I really LOVE that stuff! It features a clever alien takeover concept and I was completely hooked.But the ending was just plain stooopid. To take a sci-fi type premise and, at the very last minute, explain it all away as just a ""Noah's Ark"" type religious cleansing of the earth is absolutely absurd.It is almost as bad as the classic, last-chapter, ""you were only dreaming"" cop-out.Bad, Bad, Bad.On the other hand you might like this if you are big ""Left Behind"" fan!With a better ending I would have given the book at least 4 stars. As it is, I'd give it zero if it were possible!"
3,The Best of Koontz,"I haven't read this book yet, and I've strayed from his books for some years due to cookie-cutter characters. If you only read one more Koontz book in your life, make it ""Watchers."" One of my favorite books ever."
4,"I loved it, but to each his own","I thought this was an entertaining read that gives you some things to think about. As far as the bad reviews go, since I've read every Koontz book so far, I must say I don't get that this was a departure for him at all. I speculate that some of these reviews are based more on the spiritual aspects of the story than on the writing quality. To that I say ""Get over it already!!"" Don't readKoontz if you want a distopian hopeless horror story. Personally I find that stuff a yawn!"
3,"Interesting ""Take"" on an Overused Story Line","The storyline is familiar. Stranges things begin happening, terror ensues, aliens take over the lives of John and Joan Doe, blah blah blah...However, this story still has enough interesting subtext to remain somewhat fresh and enjoyable.For instance, who else besides Koontz can make fungi terrifying? Koontz takes a chance, where other authors would simply make the aliens as ghoulish, disgusting, deformed, and hideous as text on a page in a paperback can make them sound. Of course, fungi by itself isn't scary, so of course Koontz throws in juicy nuggets here and there to make this a spine tingling tale that is sure to shock the reader. An intriguing book that is very much recommended, but just average by Koontz standards."
1,A weak effort by a traditionally fantastic writer,"Ok, I have read Dean Koontz since Lightning and every book has been excellent or at least very good. This book was disappointing on SO many levels. The story was pretty boring...you never really care about the main characters...you never get a satisfying explanation for everything that happened...I'm sure Mr. Koontz will wow us with future novels, but this once can safely be passed on..."
2,pathetic attempt,"I ONLY gave it 2 stars because the beginning started out great. I was entralled. Then as it unraveled, I completely lost interest. Typical ""monster"" story, but with new heroes...dogs!! Great!! Whatever. It ended completely awful, the final chapter just really putting the book to shame. Very bad attempt at an end of the world book. Spare yourself!!"
2,"It was the best of openings, it was the worst of endings","This book is an unintended paradox. It contains perhaps the best beginning of any of Koontz's books, yet probably the worst ending. That's not the whole problem--the middle isn't much good either. The minute descriptions of fungi are needlessly detailed, literally nauseating, and serve no purpose. And they go on and on and on. Did I mention the descriptions of fungi?As you read through the book, you keep wondering how certain issues will be resolved--the simple answer is: they aren't.Koontz is still one of the most talented writers in America. I've heard that Mr. Koontz has gone back to rewrite some of his previous books. I'd like to see him do that with this one--keep the first 1/4 of the book, and do something completely different with the rest."
2,Dean please come back,The best book I ever read of Koontz was From the Corner of His Eye.Things have gone downhill.He has started with weird music and lost track of those of us paying for these increasingly weirder booksHello Dean??? What can we do to get you back?don't get this book.ellen in atlanta
4,Not my favorite,"I consider myself a Koontz-aholic. When this new book wasreleased I immediately purchased and read...no, devoured it.It's a fast read, but not his best story. This storyline was notwhat I expected, but it did engage my interest. I wanted to seewhere it was going. And without giving anything away, I'd saythat the book redeemed itself in the last few pages, so that Ifinally closed the cover with a ""Hmmmmmm...whoa!""I'd recommend it as summertime reading."
1,The Taking,This book stunk. I am a long time fan of Koontz but if he keeps writing stuff like this I won't be. The Face was just as bad. Hey Dean stop goofing off and give us stuff like The Bad Place and Watchers!!!!
2,"Different for Koontz, and better","I find it interesting that the opening review here smites King for Koontz. The two couldn't be more different, true, but King of late fills his books with compelling characters and a certain humanity the horror genre often lacks.Koontz also takes a different approach than most horror, ignoring the endless repetition of gory descriptions, but his characters never feel fully fleshed out. They never quite seem human, and always read like characters in a book. For this Koontz is rarely amongst my reads, despite friends in the publishing business that seem to give me every release gratis.The preachiness in this book mentioned by others is clear. It's there, and it will grate on you. For once, though, the characters seem to have some life in them outside of simple words on a page.Koontz seems to be trying something new, and rising as more than a mere RL Stine for adults. This story is more novel and less cookie-cutter, but still has ways to go."
2,good start,"This story starts out well. It grabs you from the begining, wondering what the heck it could be. But about half way thru the book, the story peters out. It starts to go the way of the new version of 'the second comimg' modern style. It could have been so much better. Koontz seems to stumble through the story like he had a good idea but didn't quite know where to take it. The ending was goofy, with 'them' just leaving, leaving a 'a brave new world'. Koontz is capable of so much better. It seems he just can't seem to get beyond his catholic upbringing. He seems compelled to insert some of it into his other books as well. I was disapointed in this one especially."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Yes, I had to break out the dictionary a couple times (okay, a few), because this novel is full of metaphorical filler. It's filled with alot of prose that just seems to be endless. The storyline and plot had potential and the visuals were extraordinary. Overall a nice effort. The ending and overall explanation meant to convey a religious overtone ruined it. Hopefully you're not going this route because it sells, if you are, you're going to lose some fans.""If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed."" -Albert Einstein"
1,Is it fair to review a book you just couldn't read???,"I started this book with high hopes. I just couldn't get past the second chapter! For some reason, the writing style Koontz chose for this book was so annoying that I just couldn't make myself read any further. Any you know what? There are too many good books out there to read, so don't waste your time on a bad one.First, it's almost like Koontz sat with a Thesaurus after he finished the story and changed what felt like 50 words in each paragraph to a word so obscure that even my English-major sister was looking them up in a dictionary. OK - I'm exaggerating the number, I'm just telling you how it felt.Second, his excessive use of similes was so distracting that I found myself counting how many of them appeared on each page."
1,don't be ridiculous,"The Mist + Dreamcatcher + The Stand (by Stephen King) + Webster's New World Roget's A-Z Thesaurus + Oxford's Dictionary (19th century edition with obsolote words) + some phantasmagorial psalms + some small church talk + almost-blasphemy-like unacknowledged T.S Elliot borrowings = the Taking...with a bonus of one of the worst endings in the history; worse than that of Strangers, another book of him and Stephen King's ItSure you will feel uplifted when you finish it. You will be actually GLAD to get rid of it.By the way, it is T.S. ELLIOT, not Eliot...Bad. Simply bad."
2,"Cliche upon Cliche, Not in a good way.","This book has a pretty good start but as usual with most of KOONT'S books they veer out of control in the middle and crash at the end. I spend more time critiquing than enjoying! Try ""Phantoms"" instead, it's not perfect but it's a far cry better than this mess. Better yet! read anything by Jeff Long this guy knows how to write an engaging, intelligent, unpredictable thriller!."
1,Geez...,"I've been a Dean Koontz fan for many years now. Or was, anyway. I used to recommend his books to everyone; he even became my favorite author, dethroning Stephen King! His books had a little of everything...although sometimes the cheese-factor gets out of hand.You know, it's funny, but when I used to discuss books and novelists with other people, I used to joke about Dean Koontz, ""...in the past few years, he's either found Jesus or joined a cult!"". The conclusion of this book confirms that I was closer to the truth than I initially thought.Read his earlier stuff!"
1,Worst ever,Should not even have bothered writing this novel. I have read all of his novels and this is the worst. Leave the sermon for sunday school.
3,Letdown ending,"I read this book because a friend recommended it. The book was great right up to the last few chapters. I found the ending to be a total letdown. It was almost as though Mr. Koontz had just ran out of ideas or something and just did a hurry-up and get it over with ending. I still love his work and despite this not so wonderful book, I'll always read more."
2,A disappointment.,"I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A ""Left Behind"" book?"
2,Concur with reported audio issues,"I finally upgraded to an HDTV and Blu Ray player, and ""Dark City"" was the first disc I put in to test my new system. That was an unfortunate choice, because the audio static drove me crazy trying to figure out what I had set up incorrectly. Now that I've read other reviews here (and verified that my other Blu Rays sound terrific), I realize the problem is the ""Dark City"" disc. While I'm obviously relieved the problem is not my new TV or player, I'm disappointed I won't have an enjoyable Blu Ray experience with this film (apparently until I upgrade from simple stereo to full surround sound). I've seen ""Dark City"" in the theaters and on regular DVD, so I didn't hesitate to buy it again on Blu Ray. It's a beautiful, 5-star film, but be leery of this Blu Ray audio experience."
2,Slow and boring,"I love science fiction, but not this movie. The first few minutes are great. A man wakes up without a memory. He is confused and scared. Then everything just becomes a painful, slow bore. The beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is wasted in this atrocious movie. Sleep. You can go to sleep. Sleep I did."
3,Let's not go overboard,"Don't be fooled by the insistent visual style. This film is muddled, unpleasant, and rather pointless. It's solidly worth 3 stars, but is really no more than a minor cult favorite."
2,Bad Acting,"This film has some of the worst acting i've ever seen. The movie has a good story line but it;s hard to watch with this terrible acting. DONT BUY THIS, you will only watch it once. Hire it out."
3,"Tired, boringand a waste of bright talent in this dark city",the plot is NOT compelling. Poor script..Keifer's acting is laughable-a waste of other talented actors. Why is Connoly given such terrible movies to be seen in ???
4,Cool movie !,This movie reminds me of the same city like landscape that the Matrix holds. I think the same cinematographer worked on both of those films but that's my opinion. This movie is really good and the story is worth watching the movie and finding out exactly what is wrong with the town. The main character is excellent at portraying his innocence when he is the one with the true power and starts unlocking deep secrets held in the most darkest places of the town. Cool movie and worth the pick up!
3,really 3 and a half cause...,this movie has the best filmwork and awesome use of colors and the dark and murky 50's look is beautiful. now past that the story really sucks.you can tell they threw in a cheesy happy ending. it should have ended when the two men knocked down the wall.mabey there will be a directors cut and it will pull a ala blade runner on us and cut out the stupid happy ending that just doesent fit.
3,"VISUALLY STUNNING, BUT....","This film is truly visually stunning, but I tend to go along with the more negative reviews of it. I found the plot not to be intellectually ""challenging."" but just plain convoluted.It does support my idea, however, that one should always go for the DVD version of a film"
2,Dark Pity,"I purchased this film solely on the reviews and without previewing. Though I am a huge fan of the genre, it is extremely rare when it is well done. This was indeed a sophmoric work, a grand idea but without a budget and substandard writing (Sam Raimi???)it is difficult to pull off. It seems that Blade Runner, with about the same two or three soundstages, created a world far more unique and captivating. This story had a great influence on the Matrix, but it developed unnaturally fast even to be comic book plausable. It was sloppy, choppy and without depth. Finally, when the true nature of the ""Dark City"" is revealed, it reminded me of some bad anime, full of techinical imagery, but without any true vision.In short, its drive-in fare"
5,Great movie and great on DVD!,"This movie was one of the best I've seen in over a year! The imagery and production were superb! Certainly in the ranks of Blade Runner or Coppola's Dracula for being visually stunning. I was surprised at the defensive nature of the special features section, as I don't see anything for which the makers of this film to be apologetic or even defend. This film will stand on its own as have Metorpolis, Blade Runner and other movies that took their audiences further than may have been comfortable for some. I encourage you to listen to part of the commentary by Roger Ebert - he clearly liked this movie as well, and offers unique insight in his commentary."

4,Shell Beach,"I saw this in it's orignal version some time back. Didn't really catch on to it, was confused basically. Just watched the directors cut...and now I'm a believer. Second time around I had an idea of what this deal was about..and it made all the difference. I like entering a ""different world"" in a film, and this one does a very convincing job. Some magnificent sets, with moody lighting. Good actors, intriguing story. Looking forward to another re-watch in the future."
3,light sci-fi,"The movie has its moments. Cool special effects for your big-screen. The objective of the aliens is balmy if you are not a Star Trek fan. Well, one for the DVD library."
4,Dark city was better than I remembered,"Dark City was better movie than I remember. It had a great story, but the editing for the movie just screwed it all up. But still a very good movie."
4,Great!,Kudos for having both theatrical and directors cut on the same blu-ray. The quality is stunning and the sound is chimed to perfection. This is an unusual film. It is a noir science fiction. Think Bogart meets the Borg from Star Trek. Not for the casual film fan.
4,Very Cool!,This is a really cool movie. Its has an original story great cinematography and some pretty good actors. It's about a city where it always seems to be night. It is under the control of aliens that use human bodies as their vessels. Time sometimes stops so that the aliens can come out and take people without anyone knowing. The catch is that noone seems to notice. That is except for one man. He notices that the place isn't what it seems to be. His memories are also fabricated. The aliens don't like that someone realizes their scheme. Especially since he has the power to stop them. This is a great gothic sci-fi film. It's definitely one of a kind. You should check it out.
4,The Road to Fun,"This book is a lot of fun, whether you're planning a major road trip or just dipping in for a little armchair travel. Knowles writes with genuine enthusiasm for the history and the people of the Mother Road, but he keeps his focus on what's here, now. This is no endless list of sites for long-defunct motor courts. The Route 66 Adventure Handbook lets readers know there is life and, yes, adventure, on the old road yet."
5,A Great Guide to 66,"We traveled the Route in 2004. I saw this book a couple times, but didn't buy it until New Mexico (I thought we had plenty of Route 66 guides)...kicked myself for not getting it earlier all the way to LA. Definitely buy this before you go and use it for helping to set up your itinerary. It has all of the essential stops, and you can tell it's written from the heart."
4,Route 66 Adventure Handbook: Turbocharged Fourth Edition,Book in very good condition and is providing the expected info for the trip I am planning within the next two years.
3,Tri training,"The book has some good information for new Triathletes, but is pretty basic. Anyone can use this book, but it's definitely geared toward novice athletes."
3,Stripsearch - self-titled (Magna Carta),"Stripsearch is a solo effort by A Perfect Circle's drummer Josh Freese.He's joined by Mike Elizondo on bass,Michael Ward on guitar and his brother Jason Freese on sax.May be tough to describe Stripsearch's music as they combine noise,rock and experimental jazz.The formula appears to work here.Tunes that convinced me this CD is worth checking out were the ten-minute epic opener ""The Baby-Faced Assassin"",the shadowy ""Orange Fragile"",the somewhat jazzy ""The Mongoose"" and ""The Real Deal""."
2,Not my style,"I'll confess I only made it through the first 2 chapters, then I quit. The info seemed decent, but you really have to like this style of writing, which I don't. I'm guessing the author's 3 main objectives, in order of priority, were (1) be light 'n' breezy even if you say nothing (we learn that the bagpipes are ""an instrument intended to make up for the country's ongoing lack of battle strategy""); (2) imitate David Barry; (3) say something about Celtic history. If you like that style (and it appears other reviewers do), then fine. If you don't, well I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter."
2,SCATTERED LAUGHS IN THIS SO-SO ETHNIC COMEDY! 2 1/2 STARS!,"'A Wake In Providence' is certainly going to appeal to some more than others and while I enjoy a good ethnic comedy, especially one that happens to be poking fun at my own background, I found this film to have more misses that hits. Some of the best laughs come from a young Asian boy who is brought up by an Italian family and his delivering of many familiar phrases is hilarious. Unfortunately the rest of the film is not as consistent.The cast is good and the Italian family is spot on, but there are only scattered laughs. I've seen this all before and done better. The interracial relationship seems like an after thought and seems a little out of place."
4,Funny Family Drama,"The main reason I got this is because I am a huge Adrienne Barbeau and as always she made the most of this part. The movies focus is the funeral of an families Patriarc and it moves slow but is a wonderful look behind the personalities, quirks and predjudice. I know people like this and it was a great way to spend a few hours."
4,This is a great CD. I would recomend it to people.,I like this CD because it is cristion and it is very relaxing to my brain. Sometimes I even fall asleep. It is a great CD.
5,I Heard Said the Bird,"This is a delightful book. I bought it for my 2 year old grandson who was about to become a big brother. I have continued to find all kinds of reasons to say ""I heard said the bird."""
1,garbage,this was one of the worst movies i ever bought first the picture was fuzzy never clear also everyons head when the persons were standing were cut off its the worst movie i ever seen
4,Great Solution!,"This is a great solution for that switch that needs to stay ON! Cover is easy to install with existing switchplate screws. Side of cover is open in case you ever need to turn switch off, such as in an emergency."
4,makes skin feel smooth,"I love how this product makes my skin feel. Once you put it on, you feel the heat working. Once you rinse it off, your skin feels extremely smooth!!!"
1,Not good,"A consant rehashing of the same topics chapter after chapter...dry, uninteresting...yet had to read for class. Good luck w/ this one unless you are a believer in any number of Ed. theories."
3,OK... but wanting,"I'm on my way to Costa Rica and all the pronunciation in this dictionary are in European Spanish... often quite different from the Latin American pronuciations. The English pronunications are ofteb quite different also. Some good feautres, but crude. Keep trying! Evertually you'll get it. I wish you would come out with something for the people in the States. Thanks"
5,The Usborne Living World Encyclopedia,The book was received in excellent condition and the timing was as specified. My Grand Daughter is happy. So I am happy !
3,A little dated...,"The project instructions were clear and easy; tells you exactly what you need to make project. And what sizes to have the wood cut. But the projects were a little dated and plain even though this wasn't published that long ago. All in the same wood color, very basic styles. I'll make the bookscases, but would like to have seen them with trim on the front and maybe some moulding on the top and painted in a nice color or black. I think this just needs an update to current styles. Kitchen Island quite boxy, etc."
3,For Disco And Techo Whizzes Only,"""Love's Divine"" is arguably, one of the most beautiful and well crafted songs Seal has done to date. In fact, producer Trevor Horn did a remarkable job on Seal IV with his production. However, this CD-single is only for techno whizzes or disco lovers. The original album version is not here. Of the five mixes, the ""Passenger Radio Mix"" is the most faithful, but the others are variations on the theme with some (actually good) remixes with the standard dance beat."
2,"Interesting Character, But the Book Could Have Been Better","Pancho Barnes is undeniably an incredible character in aviation history. But this book could have done a better job telling her story. The narrative was extremely repetitious, stating certain character traits over and over again, as if the reader had forgotten them. There wasn't enough detail; certain events that seemed important were glossed over or mentioned in passing as if the author hadn't done her homework.But the worst part of the book (for me) was the author's statement that Charles Lindbergh was the first man to fly across the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Anyone knowledgeable about aviation knows that this feat was accomplished in 1919 by Alcock and Brown in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Almost 100 aviators crossed the Atlantic BEFORE Lindbergh. This statement, which was so matter-of-fact yet so incorrect, makes me wonder how many other ""facts"" the author got wrong."
2,most boring movie i've seen this whole year!,"oh man what a long movie, seems like four hours instead of two. The same song played throughout the entire film, and i believe the sex scenes played throughout the movie where actually just one scene being repeated haha. Well just my opinion you may like it, the only good thing about this entire film is the appearance of renowned actress naomi watts and it is a sadness her character was put to shame in the film."
3,could have been better,"The story is very compelling, but the makers of this film spent much too much money on how the movie looks, and forgot to tell the story in a way that could be believed."
3,Interesting,"Articles and short stories by renowned writers on con artists, grifters and the grift. Some were very interesting some just mildly engrossing. Interesting is the best description of my opinion."
5,This is a fabulous book.,"Steinway & Sons is one of the best books of its kind I have ever read. It's carefully researched, informative, entertaining, and clearly written. It's an exceptional example of scholarship that brings to life times gone by, looking through the lens of the Steinway saga. Read this book! You won't be sorry!"
2,Short screws.,This bracket comes with screws that are way too short to actually use to connect it to the bicycle.Aside from that it is okay.
3,Not perfect.,Very sturdy bracket but doesn't contain every thing I need to install a rear bike rack. I still had to visit the nearest hardware store for additional nuts and bolts to complete the install.
5,Bright new author!,"Heartless vividly depicts the danger of the criminal mind and proves that Steve Doyle is among the brightest new authors to hit the thriller scene. With an unusual plot and interesting characters, Heartless leaves you breathless one instance and lets you exhale the next. A great read!"
1,How to Pass Your Police Oral Interview,"Author encourages Officers to lie about, cover up, or ignore inappropriate conduct by fellow officers. His suggested responses to questions asked at oral interviews will only prevent a person from being hired."
1,Why I was not happy with it.,"I wanted a VCR that would record a TV program. Unless you have a cable box or satelite you can't record. I know it's practically unheard of for a person to not have cable or satelite, but I don't. Anyway, how does a lay person know that it won't work for that when they buy it on line. It does work well and it has good clarity, so I decided to keep it."
1,No TUNER Included,"This product does not have its own tuner, which is not mentioned on Sony's webpage, nor in any specifications of the product. It is ""revealed"" unhappily after purchase. If one has a surround system, this product is incompatible. Trying to get Sony representatives to confirm this disadvantage was enormously frustrating."
5,Nice DVD/VCR combo,We purchased this machine three years ago and so far have enjoyed it very much. Have had no problems with it. It is easy to use and the remote is easy to figure out.
1,Very disapointing,"We bought this as a replacement for a worn out older dvd/vcr player . At first everything was fine. We've now had it for about 4 months and the vcr heads just up and crapped out! Nothing changed, we didn't do anything. Just went to put in a movie and the tracking seemed off. Then it just got worse and worse. We cleaned the heads several times to no avail. Tried EVERYTHING! DVD player works fine still. But it doesn't do us any good since we still have a ton of tapes. I think it's a POC and even at $90 it was a waste of money."
1,VHS Tapes Skip,I'm sorry I bought this piece of junk. Pre-recorded VHS tapes skip badly when played back on this machine.
5,Love our new Sony DVD/VHS player!,"It was easy to install, no hissy fits. Everything works great!! Loved the free shipping too."
1,Sony SLV-D380P DVD/VCR Tunerless Progerssive Combo Player,"This was the worse choice I ever made. Let me warn you, You do not want to purchase the Sony SLV-D380P Tunerless Progressive Scan DVD/VHS Combo Player."
4,No Problems Here,"I bought the DVD/VSH Combo a few weeks ago and so far, so good. I find it easy to understand, very simply remote. It does exactly what I needed it for and the price was unbeatably when compared to similar models on other sites. It doesn't have a tuner but that wasn't a feature I was actively seeking so that doesn't factor in my decision on whether this is a good product or not. Again, no problems here!"
4,Surprising,"Perfect movie for beer lovers and those that appreciate the human evolutionary experience. I never realized how much of an impact beer has had on modern society, but after watching this movie, it all makes sense. Great flick!"
1,Disappointed!!!!,"We bought this Dress and Dance Dora for our 3 year old. It worked for about a day. The voice output continued to work but the motor quit and she wouldn't dance. Changing the batteries didn't help. We returned it to the store for a new one. The second Dora worked for about a week, then the same thing happened. The motor would quit about half way through a song. We exchanged this one for a dress up adventure Dora. Needless to say we have a very disappointed daughter!"
4,big hit at party,"My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and she loves it. And so did many of the little party guests!! Dora ""dances"" best on hardwoord or kithcen floors, not to well on carpet. My daughter can change skirts easily, no problem. Recommend for any Dora fan!"
3,Not for little ones,My daughter loves Dora but she had this one broken in a matter of a month. It was cute while it lasted but I don't think this is good for kids under 4.
3,Dancing Dud,We were not so happy with this product. My daughter adoreds Dora but this particular Dora did not go over as well as her expectations had anticipated! I was somewhat disappointed.
3,Too expensive on amazon,"This doll is available online from toys r us for only 32.99! Don't buy it for over 100 dollars! My 2 year old wants this for Christmas and played with it in the store, seems like it will be a good buy."
1,Do not waste your money.,My daugher recieved this expensive($40) doll for Christmas. She worked the first day doing both dances after that she only does the one. The switch inside her is no longer working and I have a disappointed child. It's too loud (as most toys these days) and does not do very much to begin with.
5,Absolutely great!,Justin is pure music genius. An artist. And his band brings it all together perfectly.
3,Good but not great,"While this is a good movie, it's certainly not great, and not among Chaplin's best efforts (that is of course a very high standard). Some funny parts, but many dull spots, from a dramatic as well as a comedic point of view. Seeing Chaplin and Keaton together is of course wonderful, but in earlier years Chaplin would have made even more of such an opportunity. For really top drawer Chaplin see City Lights, The Gold Rush and The Kid (and follow those up with Modern Times, Great Dictator and the great Mutuals)."
2,Embarassingly painful to watch,Chaplin was at his worst here. He styled himself a philosopher in this movie and spends way too much time spouting his half-baked thoughts about everything you can imagine. Chaplin may have thought of himself as a wise old sage but his self-written dialogue makes him sound more like an ignorant old fogey who doesn't know when to shut up. He passes off the tritest of observations as ageless wisdom and the audience wonders if it is a joke. Horrible movie but Keaton is a joy to watch.
5,An Anthology That Will Truly Charm You,"Rare are the anthologies and collections which do not depend on strong stories to carry a few weaker selections. MOJO: CONJURE STORIES is most certainly a rarity. Every story casts its own kind of spell on the reader, drawing in like sweetly scented smoke and making your head spin.Look at just some of the Big Names Nalo Hopkinson has snared for this extraordinary volume: Steven Barnes, Tananarive Due, Neil Gaiman, Barbara Hambly. The other names you might not recognise yet, but their stories are going to send you scurrying off, trying to unearth more of their work.Destined to place high on many top ten lists for 2003!"
4,Nice change....,Good read but is very much like reading Edith's mythology only a little easier to read. Good writing but written in 100 percent story form which is what I am looking for.
5,Fun to read and interesting,"If you want to learn some Greek Myth without getting a headache, buy this book. If you're just looking for something enjoyable that's not too hard to read, but yet interesting, buy this book. If you just want a good read, buy this book."
4,Another winner from Canadian 'battlin' barrister' Doug Christie,"Canada was a test case for theNew World Odor power brokers,the Bilderberg branch of whichwill meet this June, 2008 herein Virginia. Be sure to meet themwith protest, Mr and Mrs America!"
2,Book Content is Great… book itself damaged,"I was upset to receive a damaged book without a receipt! I like this book, but I am not happy about how it arrived."
5,A Page Turner!,"Ken Lewis has a unique style of writing, incorporating his experience with the Oregon police force into his fiction. This novel is filled with rich characters and interesting twists. He'll take you for a suspenseful ride on the Oregon coast, and lead you to a surprise ending!"
3,Ok,I watched these shows when I was a kid so I bought it for my kids to see. They like it and so do I.
5,cleaning product,Love it!!! Does exactly what I need it to do. Will be ordering these again in the very near future.
4,Cleaning Pads,"The pads work fine, but they need to have an economy pack. After a few uses, a new one is needed."
2,Not impressed,"does not compare to some $4.00 scrubbers we bought last year at Canadian Tire. Would not buy again,,,,not worth it."
5,Ceramic-glass cooktop cleaning pads,These pads came with the stove and worked well so I bought a pack from Amazon to have on hand. They do a thorough job and protect the surface. My order came in 3 days and I am very pleased.
5,Torin Jack TA91206,"I purchased this jack to lift a motor-home. I was hoping that I had bought one that would still be able to lift up the vehicle so I could change a tire on the road if need be. After lifting rear of motor-home as a test with my air compressor, I tried the pump action on the jack, concerned that it may not work due to the fact it was a very short stroke with little resistance pressure. I was impressed that it lifted with ease, though not as fast as the air assist it still worked awesome. Thanks Amazon for selling another great product."
1,Not practical - head is too large - too much plastic.,"The end of the hose (the part that attaches to your tire valve, etc) is too large. I can't use it on my kids' bikes because it won't fit between the spokes on their tires, and I can't use it on my car because it won't fit in the nook on my wheels. It is even difficult to use to inflate balls with an inflation needle. It is difficult to get the needle attached to the hose-end because the diameter of the cavity, into which the needle goes, it slightly too small. With force, you can get it in, but good luck trying to get it back out.Part of the reason for all these prolems is that too much plastic is used in the hose-end. If they only used steel, it could have been made much smaller - and therefore much more useful."
1,1 star cause I am sympathetic,Not good...poor story line dull acting...oh what a tragedy...could have been better with a better script or actresses...hmmm maybe not..should have donated the money to make this to a womens shelter and done more good...
4,"Good ""old book""","Excellent and ""profusely illustrated"" volume on every sort of curve (spiral) you can imagine; both in the natural world and in architecture. Some of the ""science"" may have been overtaken, but that does not detract from the overall quality. Written in 1914, the Dover edition is surprisingly readable and informative. Recommended."
1,Case Logic is a flawed design,"The sleeves on all Case Logic products have the same flaw. They tend to collect tiny particle of dust, dirt, sand, or whatever that cling to the soft back of the sleeve. These particles in turn serve to scratch your cd's repeatedly over a period of time. There is really no cure to this problem either, except to keep your cd's in their cases. I have ruined about half of my discs so far. Even some brand new ones that get played more repeatedly."
5,Marvelous Movie,This is a marvelous movies. It's a shame that it's so hard to get ahold of. The music is wonderful. The plot line superb. It has values that it teaches (such as patience is a virtue). Also it shows how the ignorance/intolerance of people is bad. Although it does use that for Ribaldi to metamorphisis into his true self. I highly recommend you get this movie before the sellers sell out.
2,Not for young children,"Let me start by saying that the music is indeed beautiful. The acting however is not. The story is nothing new, very familiar territory, similar to Beauty and the Beast. The biggest problem I have with this for young children (and I have other smaller problems) is the scene at the end where the mob beats Ribaldi to death. It is very violent, the music is very intense, and entirely too much for anyone under 7. I don't think talking about it afterwards lessens the impact of that hateful and violent of a crime playing out in front of their eyes. I was very surprised at all the reviews that mention little children watching this. If I was rating the music alone I would likely give it a 4, the movie however is poorly done."
5,Watermarks,"This is a compelling review of anti-semitism in Austria before and during the Hitler era, brought into current times when 7 champion swimmers who escaped to various parts of the world tell their stories and are then brought back to Vienna to swim together again."
1,BEAUTIFUL QUILTS AS YOU GO,THIS BOOK DID NOT GIVE INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN PUBLISHED PRIOR TO THIS DATE.NOTHING NEW.
4,Review of Chicago Cutlery Insignia2 18 Piece Knife Set,"If you are looking at this item, you (should) already know it is not the highest quality knife set out there. That being said, for the price, it is a really nice item. We've had this set for about two months and the knives are sharp, there are a good number of them, and the scissors and sharpener are good, too. Definitely recommended for this price (we paid about $109)."
3,Not Bad,They need to be sharpened more often than I would like. After a month of use they are showing some rust. At this price I was expecting better.
2,Too expensive for a bad quality product,"I bought this cutlery because I had a similar chef knive. However, with 3 months of use, it started to rust. When I called their warranty, they said that it must be something wrong with water in our house. The blade is too thin, and the edges started to break. I wouldnt buy this. I think in probably six months I will buy a better knive."
4,Good value and product,"So far, I've only used a couple of steak knives and some of the other larger knives. I was very impressed by the weight and balance of these knives; I also used my amazon points to get it cheaper!!!"
2,Two Stars for the Commentary Alone!,"Although it has been noted by other reviewers, I just wanted to note how unusual the commentary track is on this disc. For the first 10 minutes, you get a pretty standard HGL play by play. Then, he leaves and the founder of Something Weird Video sits around with David Freidman and a few other (hard to hear) people and discusses the history of the company. They finish their story early, however, so for the last half hour or so, it is all filler! You would think this would be terrible, but in truth it is pretty entertaining. The SW guy actually makes a point to say that the commentaries are usually much more professional than this--right before he gets a phone call from his wife! As far as the movie goes, no nudity, not much violence to speak of, and only really notable for a scene where a man is attacked by his bedsheets. That's pretty brilliant, but the rest is dull. Think of the exposition scenes in Blood Feast, if you need an example..."
1,SOMETHING DREADFUL !!,"Even by HGL standards, this movie is a complete disappointment. It is all bad in every respect - it even fails to be amusing in its badness. If by some bizarre magic, one were actually able to consider BLOOD FEAST to be the pinnacle of movie-making, SOMETHING WEIRD would fall at the very bottom. The basic plot concept has some promise, but the acting throughout sounds as if the actors were reading their lines for the first time after a night of no sleep. In fact, the best thing about this DVD is the cover. Unfortunately, actress Elizabeth Lee never looks so pretty at any point in the film, not even in the scene from which the cover is taken. This is mainly the result of horrible, garish makeup, especially around the eyes. The potential viewer should pull a copy of the cover off the internet and avoid a waste of money and time. (I gave this one star only because one cannot award less than that.)"
5,Case Logic CD-ROM Storage Sleeves,THERE GREAT I LIKE THEM EASY TO TAKE OUT OF THE SLEEVES I'M A DJ I FIT A LOT MORE CD'S IN A CASE
3,do you really need a review of this product,"Listen...these are plastic sleeves that protect cds, and can be put in a binder. I use them to mail cd's to people that I trade live music with. If you need some, buy 'em. End of story."
1,Stories so ugly you fear you'll never find happiness again,"Described as ""hilarious, sexy, and deeply tender"", this book is anything but. Instead I read an ugly book of ugly characters. While the writing is masterful in creating the twin emotions of depression and despair within the reader, there is no rational reason why any reader would choose to feel this way. I left ""Kissing in Manhattan"" wondering where the stories promised by the book jacket had gone. Maybe Patrick tied them up and refused to let them come out and play."
5,Great read!,"The zanyness of the lives of the characters in this book are reminiscent of Vonnegut to me. Schickler does such a wonderful job of character development, that at the end of the book you're dying to read more about these people. Kissing In Manhattan was very amusing indeed, and I couldn't put it down."
5,"Funny, absorbing, didn't want them to end.","This was the best collection of stories I've read since the first collections by Thom Jones came out. They all grabbed me, entertained, tickled, comforted and somehow made me feel a whole lot better...just don't know what to read next that's as good??"
3,"Tons of potential, but a disappointing end","I loved ""The Smoker"" when I read it last year in the New Yorker's fiction issue, so I was psyched to see he had a whole book out. The first half of the book is really good, with beautiful stories, particularly ""The Bath."" However, after ""Kissing in Manhattan,"" it seems like Schickler tries too hard to make a larger point and strays outside of his limits. Kissing in Manhattan was an amazing story, and then to have the behavior explained in the next one sort of took away its mystique, as did the general march towards making Patrick a sympathetic character and insert some standard, cliched action. I think the author has a ton of potential, though--I'll read whatever he does next."
2,Not as good as the short story,"This book gets old fast. Yes, The Smoker story in the New Yorker was excellent, but the conceit does not extend to make a larger work. Schickler is ambitious to try to tie a bunch of city stories together, but his characters are unrealistc and quickly get annoying. The characters are as monotone as the writing. Does some one really confide to a friend about a bath time ritual after so many years of silence? Why are opal earrings handed out in a basement under a porn shop? This does not feel like real New York City at all. It's obvious that Shickler is not from New York and has not spent real time here. After reading a rave review in Details, I am very disappointed. Wait to get the paperback used."
4,Not perfect but recommended,"As other reviewers have noted, the cabinet needs to be sanded and painted before use, and the door is fairly easy to switch to hinge on the right. Not quite the quality of construction I had hoped for, but acceptable for the price."
5,Buy this- no matter what kind of music you are into,"This is great music plain and simple. I am a fan of all types of rock and reggae and this is one of my top 5 albums and my favorite DVD. The fact that the lyrics are in Spanish should not deter anyone- the language is beautiful and improves the experience. This live performance is awesome and the sound is incredible. I have found no other DVD that showcases the quality of my stereo as well. I've played this at parties and people who have never seen or heard Mana stop, watch and are mesmerized. All my friends have gone out and bought this, you will not regret it."
1,A band like all the other ones,"This band is one of the most listened latin american bands, but there so comercial, when you listen a song of them you think that you heard it before, their not like ""Los Amigos Invisibles"" or ""Gustavo Cerati"" that are making new sounds of our latin music."
5,Real Performance,"Mana's music style can get you involved into it, and in this DVD we can see how profesional they are. Sound and music quality are the features of this Latin style pop rock and this DVD."
2,"Music fabuloso, video no tan bueno","I loved this CD, so I was looking forward to the video. But I thought the video was way so-so. The music is great, but I didn't think the video added anything, because they're not particularly entertaining to watch, at least in this particular performance. I bought the La Ley MTV Unplugged after listening to that CD for months, and I found that video enchanting - re-energized my love for the music. But this tape did nothing for me - I watched it once and plan to give it away."
3,It is a Simple Thermometer,"Only Reason it did not get better review is because all the parts were in bottom of delivery box, the packaging was broke...Usually you need a knife and scissors to tear apart the packaging on these products. but it looks like this one was returned and never re packaged correctly...I have been getting a lot of this lately with other on line stores...Its poor Quality Control in these ware houses...where they send the stuff out...I just ordered 2 bottles of shampoo from a drug store and one was sealed and the other unsealed and used and had a human hair on top of bottle.....Getting back to THERMOMETER...IT works fine and is easy to read and is accurate..."
2,It Didn't Work For Me!!!,"I've used this product twice @ one hour each time, and my teeth didn't whiten!!!! I feel ripped off, especially knowing that a lot of other people received dramatic results!!! I didn't have custom whitening trays, but I did use a dual tray - I wonder if that made a difference...Damn, I should have purchased Rembrandt....BTW - THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T INCLUDE A WHITENING TRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Clean White Teeth,Nite White Excel Z 22% Teeth Whitening 3pk Kit did the trick. They whitened years of coffee and tea stains and left my teeth a beautiful white.DO not wear for long periods of time or some sensitivity will occur.
3,"Appropriate, but lacking.","I love Radiohead. Never thought twice about getting this DVD. I enjoyed a lot of the banter and interviews as well as the 'new' material and studio footage. Unfortunately, after a few viewings, much of Thom Yorke's whining and complaining gets old and I find myself skipping ahead. In true Radiohead style, this film is strange. I really enjoy many of the scenes and cityscapes that are shown along with background music. The live footage is quite good and the videos are a nice touch too. Just wish there was more to sink my teeth into, and less rock star whining."
3,For fans interested in the music and the band members....,"I, like many other radiohead fans, loved this documentary to death. Every time I watch it, I find something new..so, it's fun for me. I only give it three stars keeping in mind that though I believe it's very interesting, chances are it wont be that impressive to non-radiohead fans. But I highly recommend it for fans. It's got some tongue-in-cheek humor about the band, as well as some mildly frustrating things they had to put up with on tour. It's pretty interesting."
1,Making terrible documentaries is easy,"Let's make a list:1. The video is achingly jittery, about as saturated as a mental ward, and just a terrible montage of meaningless things.2. The audio is absolutely worthless. Most of the time there is such an obnoxious room echo that words become completely lost in the noise, and anyone interested in what band members say will be quite pissed to say the least.3. Because of the previous two things, there is no sense to the documentary. It is simply a jumble, and it's as if Grant wants to make the viewer just as sickly and depressed as Thom himself.My verdict? Radiohead is awesome; MPIE isn't good enough to act as a paperweight. If you aren't a rabid fan, don't bother even renting this. If you ARE a rabid fan, you will most likely be even less impressed with this video than I was."
3,The reviews are a little generous.,"This video shows how depressing it is to be in a famous rock band touring the world. The point is well taken. The video is not spectacular. A little too much Colin and Ed, not enough Thom and Jonny. Much of the dialogue cannot be understood."
3,You must like radiohead,"if you dont like radiohead at the most elevated level, you probably will not like this dvd. I like abstract art, but this is just repetitive recycled home video. this DVD has good parts, but dont waste the cash, convince a friend to buy it and then go watch it at his house...Just call him a chicken if he won't buy it...keep at it until he cracks and buys it."
3,A bit boring...,"I'm a huge Radiohead fan and was very excited to finally buy this dvd, but I have to say I was disappointed. It hardly makes sense, the director jumps from scene to scene and when one of them is being interviewed a song is playing in the background, most of the time, so it is hard to concentrate on one thing. Sadly, it's pretty boring right from the start."
4,Post-modernism a la Tom York,"Blending Radiohead's moody melodies with frenetic cinemaphotography, this tape becomes more a statement and expression of Radiohead's vision than just a casual following the band with a camera. It's an artful blend of sound and images, with some unintentional comic relief by Tom York trying to stay underwater in their ""No Surprises"" video. I felt that I came a little closer to understanding his dark vision after watching him choke in his water helmet.The only downside is because it's so artfully blended, the music sometimes becomes more a backdrop to the images. I was thrilled to hear their excellent live version of ""Karma Police"" on the David Letterman show, but frustrated when it too was blended into a backdrop for the overall statement of the documentary.I highly recommend it, not specifically for hearing their music, but for bringing Radiohead's true message closer to its fans."
2,"Just your average, run - of - the - mill rockumentry","How disappointed I was when this video finally arrived. Whilst I was expecting to find an intelligent insight into the makings of Ok Computer and the subsequent touring... all I found was a typical rockumentry. When I say typical, I mean a film that speaks nothing of the band as a whole but instead is a showcase for the director's arrogance. In it's entirety, I'd estimate that in the 1 1/2 hours of screen time, there was probably about 35 minutes of the band speaking about their thoughts on life and fame... whilst the rest of the time was devoted to Grant Gee shooting scenes that bared no relevance to the band. When I read the caption: ""A film about Radiohead"", I was expecting to find in depth interviews with each band member... after all, Grant Gee did spend a fair amount of time with them. However, all I got was a bunch of images set to music for an hour and a half."
5,Lovely!,"I got this for my parents and they loved it! The music box works beautifully, it is very entertaining and pretty. It was such a nice christmas gift!"
5,Intelligent and funny,"Alesia Holliday has written a book that is both fun and intelligent. AMERICAN IDLE is a great romp behind the scenes of reality television. But while Holliday takes the reader through a series of crazy (and funny) scenes, she also makes you care about the book's sometimes-feckless heroine, rooting for her to connect with Mr. Right, whoever he might turn out to be. This book is a sweet, smart and sassy read -- a breath of fresh air. Libby"
3,Screws did not match up,"Okay piece of furniture. Some screws did not fit correctly and took a long time to put together. Tee ball on the drawer was loose no matter how much I tried to tighten in. It's for the spare bedroom so I will keep it, if it was for my master I would have returend it."
3,Cute table,"Had many pieces to put together. I ended up needing help. Looked nice when done, though and had straight lines."
4,Very nice tables,"Altogether, I've purchased 4 of these tables. The first two I bought, I left at the house when I moved out at the request of the new owners (they needed furniture). When I found a place and started getting things out of storage, I immediately purchased two new tables.They are very easy to put together, takes maybe 20 minutes if you aren't interrupted. They are sturdy enough to put most anything in and on, and I don't mind putting quite a bit on and in them. I think they are a great end table/bedside table, and the few people that have seen them have had good things to say about them.If I was looking for another set of tables, I would buy another set of these. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for an accent table."
4,Great deal,"Good looking and a great deal for the price. However, there were a few scratches on the top. Not to bad, but they were there. Was also missing some parts from one box - a drawer and some screws. Luckily I ordered two and the missing drawer happened to be in the other box."
5,Awesome deal!!,These end tables are great! I got them for my mom for Christmas and she loves them! They are super easy to put together. These exact tables are at a big retailer for double the price. So worth buying from Amazon!
4,sturdy little nightstand,Very quick and easy to put together. Solid little piece of furniture. Not bad for the price I paid .
1,Broken,This table came to us with a leg that was snapped in two. It did not seem to be something that could have possibly happened in shipping. Needless to say we sent it back. The quality seemed very cheap over all.
2,Winsome night stand,"I purchased the end table approx. six wks. ago..It arrived promptly asadvertised..Upon opening the shipping box, I was disapointed at thequality of the product..The finish was a dull finish..It wasn't realwood, it was a veneer of some type on wood substrate..The fit was fairat best..I had to rework the drawer to keep it from tilting forward andfalling out..I wouldn't recomend this item, maybe $24.99 would be a fairprice..Cheaply made.. Don S. North Carolina"
3,Strong Table Poor Drawer Design,"Winsome Wood Night Stand with Drawer, WalnutStand Is a very nice stand for the Money. But a very very poor Design on the Drawer. The drawer came in damaged By poor packing and shipping. The groove in drawer did not line up ,Screw holes were drilled wrong . I sent Letter to Importer And Requested a Whole New Drawer. Will Repost When Or If They Comply. GOD BLESS Joe"
3,nice for the price,only problem: my husband had to drill holes to line up with the screws as the pre-drilled holes that were there didn't.....kind of a pain. once that was done however and the piece was fully assembled i loved it!
3,nice but not consistant,"So i bought one a while back, then I bought the same one from Amazon to match the one I bought about 1 year ago. The new one is actually has a darker color. Not sure if it is because it is new or what... but for $35 bucks...."
3,Great lockbox for the money,I really love these lockboxes. They are strong and easy to change the combinations when you need to.I like the black ones because they blend in with the gates so no one can see them unless they are looking for it.
4,What's in a title?,"How about a metaphor on the meaning of life?There's a moment in this film when the Ted Pikul character turns to the Allegra character and says something along the lines of ""we are fumbling around here with no idea where we are going or what we are doing"", and to me that is the essence of what Cronenberg wanted to achieve in this film. I mean, at a real basic level, isn't that what we are all doing in our lives anyway?And that to me, is the genius of this film. It's a very profound look at life wrapped up in the guise of a virtual reality thriller, and an entertaining one at that. Not only that but it holds up well under repeated viewings.I'm not sure which dvd version is the best, but the one I have is from Canada & it has extras like multiple audio commentaries including one from the director which is a fascinating listen.4.5 stars."
5,"Gooey, Ooowhee, Slimy Virtual Ride.","Okay, ""The Matrix"" was getting all the computer/virtual reality/gaming attention from the movie fans. Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"" is a different kinda tech movie that'll make you go--""Whaat? "" or ""Eeeeeww"" with it's visuals and it's plot twists. See it and put it along side your copy of ""The Matrix"". And get lost in the fantasy and reality motif of these two computer games on film. It is right up ol' Zen's alley, and I think you'll enjoy it, too."
1,Horrible,"I love sci-fi movies, but this one I found to be boring. The only reason why I have rented it in the beginning was to see Kris Lemche in it. When I have read about them playing a game, I thought it was going to be somewhat like The LawnMower man. Well part 2, but it was far from it. I haven't seen the Matrix yet, but the previews for the Matrix looks good and I have heard that it is a good movie as well."
1,"gArbaGe, rubbish, and just plain BORING!",Are you kidding me?! Viewing the Indian Head test pattern is infinitely preferable to watching this so-called thriller. Oh well.....there went $10 I could have thrown out the window of a fast-moving car.
4,definitly Cronenberg,"I understand why someone wouldn't like this movie. If your a Cronenberg fan then its definitly worth a viewing or even a purchase. Totally bizarre and disturbing. It makes the 'Matrix' look like a pokemon episode. And the dialog is not 'cheesy', its like a sci-fi ""Naked Lunch"" (and I was pleased to see much of the cast from N.L. in this movie). I feel sorry for the people who don't ""get"" this film or any other Cronenberg films. You're missing out."
3,Great movie but the extras......,This is a great entertaining movie that fans of David Cronenberg should love. The only problem is where are the extras (three commentary tracks + documentary) that are included on the Canadian and Region 2 edition of this movie?
4,"same movie, again.","I love Cronenberg films. The man has an obsession and each of his movies is an expression of his returning to the same ideas. Only with each telling there are additional leaps of concept and refinements. Think of his body of work as a mini-series. Sit down one day and watch them all, uninterrupted, one after the other, in chronological order. Try to go about your life as you did the day before, ever again. So, about eXistenZ. Enjoy the movie and afterward think about making a movie that better expresses the concept of game, within game, within game. How would that world look? What would the experience be like? Who would these people be and how would they act? Watch it again, and again, and again, and again. Put some lube in your bioport. Enjoy the psychosis."
2,typical screw-job ending.,"the first part of the movie is actually okay, but the middle and ending really lack. the middle of the movie your having a hard time staying awake because its such a snooze, the ending of the movie makes you wish you wouldnt of even seen it in the first place unless you like those endings that just leave you hanging."
3,"""Are we still in the game?""No freakn' way!","On the cover of this movie it says~""Makes THE MATRIX Look Like Child's Play.""~SAN FRAN. CHRONICLE.....Not even! Even though it has a somewhat clever plot/ending,it fails to deliver ANYTHING of the MATRIX! IT is a great movie.....if you watch it right before the MATRIX! An otherwise good movie,actors/scenery....A good choice!"
1,David; either give it up or move on...,"Okay, we know that David Cronenberg can be disgusting. But, he can be disgusting in an interesting way, at times. This movie was not one of those times. To me, it seemed as though old Dave had some nasty squelching noises left over from an earlier movie and just wanted something resembling a plot in which to play them. Though the movie twists and turns, every twist and turn is obvious at least five minutes before they happen. The ""special"" effects aren't even up to Cronenberg standards - not hi-tech, not repulsive, just plain cheesy. Unless you are a diehard Cronenberg fan, don't even think of watching this film."
1,Yuk! Waste of time,"We unfortunately rented this movie. Don't do it! I'm sorry we wasted the time and money. I only gave it a star because it's required. No star was earned. I'm sure for those that like this type of movie it's worthwhile, but I'd guess that's a small audience. Proceed w/caution."
1,"Not Good, Not Good At All !","This film lost my interest in the first ten min. The plot was too slow and not much of a climax, if one at all. The star's missed the class in witch thay tought acting, and for the FX, come on,is that the best you can do?"
5,"Fantastic, Ecclectic Mix",Compared to the rest of the music Ozo has put out this is probably their most solid integration of various types of music. With a lot more Asian influence on this album I think they hit the nail on the head. Most of the songs get your foot tapping and the lyrics in English are quite profound. Highly recommended! It has been in my CD player since I bought it last month!
4,Don't Mess With The Dragon,"""Don't Mess With The Dragon"" is Ozo's latest full-length studio album. I hesitate to call it ""full-length"" though, since it clocks in a just over a half-hour long. But I'd rather have a compact, tighter album than an overly long, drawn-out, watered-down 75-minute affair.I would agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't Ozo's best album. But it is still solid. It's upbeat and fun. Don't Mess with the Dragon is a party album, a feel-good record.One complaint - the rapping is below average and has been for quite awhile now. They could really use a guest appearance by Chali 2na, of Jurassic 5, again. I could do without rap on any future Ozo albums.Overall though, it's not mind-blowingly great, but it is good. And it's way better than 95% of the other new music you could be buying. So pick it up. It's hard to sit still and be unhappy when Ozo's coming through the speakers."
3,It's so-so,"It's ok, there's a couple of catchy tunes, like ""La Gallina"", ""Violeta"" and ""Creo"", but all in all, it doesn't produce the same type of feeling I get from their original album and Street Signs. And what the heck is the title song? I hated it. If you're an Ozo fan, then you're going to get it anyway, but don't expect the fast thought provoking songs of the previous albums that is what makes Ozomatli who they are."
2,disappointed,I expected something more than just a little documentary about a weiner dog race in Texas.
4,Great for Kids,Well received by my wife's nephew...even got him away from the X-Box for a few minutes when it was opened to check it out!
4,nice but too tall,"I really like this table except it seems very tall and I measured it before I ordered it. This table was super easy to put together, and looks nice so I am going to keep it. Its sturdier than some people have written. I would have given it 5 stars except for the height, I am going to ask my husband to shorten it."
2,Don't Like,"These tables look cute but are not sturdy at all and the paint used has a horrible smell to it, that I can't clean off."
3,It's Just Me,"I love Colton Ford and I was hoping the bio documentary would give me a deeper understanding of the guy, but it did not. There were some moving moments courtesy of Colton's partner. Basically, Naked Fame is glossy, surface marketing designed to promote interest in Colton Ford as a recording artist."
3,Behind the Scenes of a Career Struggle,"This was an interesting behind the scenes view of Colton Ford's (Glenn's) attempt to transition from one career to another. I bought it because of my interest in Ford's partner, Blake Harper (Peter), but it made me want to know more about both of Colton Ford's careers, past and present. Well worth watching, it makes you think about achieving your dreams in your own life."
5,Great showing,Able to see the early fall classics especially Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth pre 1943 prior to official highlight films.
5,very happy,Bought it for our nephew he was over the top happy !He is a huge Yankees fan so anything baseball is great !
3,"Eh, it's ok...","I have been using it for a few weeks, I haven't noticed much of a difference...I don't feel like it is any better or worse than any other cleaner I have used."
3,ok for cleaning stove top.,I got a new induction stove and wanted to keep the top in a great shape all the time. This can be hard to do when you are cooking several times a day rather it be just to brew some tea or toast some bread. I thought these would be a great idea to use for the in between cleaning but they aren't what I had hoped for. The pieces that come out of the container are small and don't seem to have enough of the cleaner on them to transfer to your cleaning area. I purchased the cleaner by itself and would recommend the cleaner and you supply the cloth to clean with it. I won't be buying this product again.
3,Works OK,"This product works good on minor stains, but not on more imbedded stains. The dispensing method leave much to be desired. It is designed to tear off one pad, but it does not tear well. I often have to use sissors to cut it."
5,"The best book on the ""ART"" of handicapping written to date.","Mark Cramer has written the most thought provoking tome I've read. There are many excellent books on the ""SCIENCE"" of handicapping. But this book brings home the the reality that races are won by flesh and blood animals prepared by mortals (trainers) who are fraught with their own strengths and weaknessses.Anyone who extrapolates figures from services or computer programs water down the past performance to a number. Predicting the future(handicapping the ""ART""), is far more involved in ""cycles"". This book is a must read for all serious handicappers"
2,"Too many errors, not worth the cost","I bought this book set to prepare to take my ChE PE exam. The example problems are riddled with errors, and the material presentation sometimes takes giant leaps ahead (i.e. employing concepts or equations they have not yet presented). After a few chapters, I abandoned it. I recommend buying the practice problem book from NCEES instead. Break out your college reactions, thermo and transport phen. books, and take your Perry's to the test -- everything you need is in there."
4,Nice case with good storage room,"I purchased this case not for a Husqvarna chainsaw, but for an electric remington that I purchased refurbished. The saw fits securely without problems. The bar sheath can be placed on either side to accomodate for right or left handed saws. The box has storage places for many common tools as well as a place to put a quart of oil and a smaller bottle of 2 stroke oil.The only thing I would improve is that the oil bottle areas do not have a strap to secure the bottles. They just sit in there and can easily fall over (although the space is limited for them to fall into but still large enough to fall). I'll probably add some stick on velcro to create a strap.Overall it seems to be a good case with a nice bonus of extra storage space."
1,Rubber leaches color,"I received the hammer promptly from the seller and it was as advertised.However, the rubber on the hammer leaches out color and stains my white coat immediately. So be careful."
3,it's okay for price.,i'm a nurse practitioner student. Its worth buying it. It's not fansy but works great for practice purpose. I didn't regret buying it.
1,Chilled Plum/red plum,"If you want a purple look do not get this. I wanted a dark purple/plum look. The base is mainly red. So my hair looked darker with a red hue. If you do not mind red then this is for you, but if you want black/purple then do not get this. Good thing is non-permanent! If you do not like this then you can always wash is out. It does not last that long."
1,"I love 98 Degrees Very Much, but this video sucked.","I am the biggest 98 Degrees fan, but I have to be honest. This video s***ked. They play the same thing over and over again. Do not waste your money on this video."
1,New Catalina,"OMG... what did you do with the most delicious-tasting Catalina that you used to have? Changing the Catalina dressing has to be the worst possible thing that Kraft could have EVER even imagined doing, most less actually doing it. The new taste is AWFUL! Please bring back the old and completely rid yourselves of this new, disgusting so-called dressing. If you want a new dressing in your line, just name it something else; DO NOT change the existing one that so many people LOVE! The new name for this should be Spiced Castor Oil!!"
2,Just skip it...,"The Velvet Teen has become a pretentious and bloated mimic machine that churns out tired imitations of yesterday's genius. This album seems more design than art, more intellectual vanity than inspired musical experimentation, and more sequins than substance. A candle fancies itself to be the Sun. If Judah could only find a pocket of honesty and humility in his ever expanding bag of tricks, perhaps he would treat us to something truly remarkable. But alas, Ego wins the day, and we are given a shifting glimpse into a carefully fabricated soul loosely based on the lives of others. Maybe some are dazzled by the illusion, but I'm disappointed. I recommend you save your money for something a bit less forced, and a good deal more authentic."
2,Good for 6 months,This iron was absolutely delghtful to use for six months. Then it started leaking water out of the bottom. We took it apart and found that an internal plastic part was broken. A part that a screw goes through to hold the top to the bottom. Glued that together and found that it did not solve the problem. Time for a new iron. What a waste of natural resources.
1,I wouldn' recommend it to an enemy...,"When I was halfway through the book, I just couldn't believe it had been penned by Barbara Delinsky. An outragious plot and dull characters do not a good romance make."
3,Works,"This wall mount bracket was functional and inexpensive. It installed relatively easy and came with all the needed hardware. I installed a 58"" plasma tv which was around 70+ lbs and it has held up fine. Two things, don't trust the level thats built into it. Secondly its pretty tight behind it and with a bigger tv its kind of a pain to adjust the locking screws from the bottom. Being that its pretty close to the wall it can also make any rear mounted connections hard to work with."
3,Can't access the back of TV.,"I like the wall mount b/c it feel very sturdy. I wish I order the one that pull out and swiwel around instead just tilt. Make it a lot easier when you need to connect wire in the back. Also, the lag bolt feel like plastic (very light) so I bought a very good one at warehouse store just to be safe. I had to return this mount and got the swivel and pull out mount instead (best decision!). There is no way I can connect in the back of my TV without taking the TV down. It barely let me fit my hands in the back."
5,Works great,"My husband had no problem installing the mount and then the tv, very easy. Good product for the price. Would recommend it."
4,great product!,"This mount was very easy to assemble & put up. It included various sizes of bolts to attach to the back of your particular tv, as different models/sizes require different hardware."
5,great mount for the price,"Definitely would buy another one, we used it for our 32"" LCD TV instead of on our larger Flat screens but it was easy to install and mount."
4,Great product great price,I actually brought this product for my cousin. I help him mount it on the wall. We were both surprised how much equipment was included and how easy it was to mount.
4,Great mount for Samsung LED,"This worked well for me. I have a 60 inch Samsung I just purchased and didn't hesitate to buy considering the price and the reviews. The free HDMI cable was cool, mount is heavy and feels strong and durable. One thing I would say is a must, use your own Leveler. The two that come with this unit are both off by a good amount. I found out the hard way and completely trusted the leveler they supplied. If you have one great, if not Local Hardware store has some great accurate ones for $8-$12. The screws supplied worked well for me too. So other than the leveler this mount has a great low profile and is worth every penny."
4,"Very easy install, can't beat TE price","So, I too was skeptical after seeing the 160+ mounts at the big stores, and seeing this for ~30-40 bucks. But, I was very happy with it - super easy to install. Me and a buddy did it, though 1 person is all you need. I was just worried about dropping my brand new tv. Love the product!"
2,It Screwed Me,"The wall mount itself is fine. It is very strong but the screws that come with the package were some of the weakest screw I have seen. I work in construction and when I saw the screws they gave me I was very hesitant to use them. All the screws snapped when they got close to the end, I had to go buy heavy duty screws to secure the mount."
3,"Great mount, great price, extremely tight fit","I bought this mount to go along with a new 47"" LG TV. There is barely enough room to squeeze a hand between the wall and the TV once it's mounted. It took me quite some time to figure out how to get all my cables and power routed. My old mount (for an old flat panel) had enough room to hang a power strip and organize cables behind the TV, but this new mount is so slim nothing will fit directly behind the TV in the mounting plate.Additionally, my 47"" TV is so tall I could barely get a screwdriver behind the TV to tighten the locking bolts. Maybe instead of an extra level and HDMI cable they should include a long screwdriver. It's impossible to tighten the bolts with the TV tilted (learned that after a few tries). It's also nearly impossible to adjust the tilt once it's on the wall.Still, it's a good price, and once you get past the pain of getting the TV mounted then thinness of the mount is very nice."
4,Well worth the money,"This is a sturdy and a heavy duty mount. I was worried when I ordered it because of the extremely low price, but once I opened the box I wasn't worried anymore. This is made of heavy duty steel and well contsructed. The only issue that I had was with the built-in level bubble.I used it to level out the mount, but it was way off level. I pulled the TV and rechecked the level and the bubble was dead center. I went and got one of my levels and checked it and it was definitely unlevel. After using my own level to set the mount it was dead on and looks great. I suggest that you use your own level to put the mount up. Because of this I could only give it a 4 on condtruction, but for $25.00 I'm not complaining."
4,Good value,The mount was easy to install and I have complete confidence that it can hold my 42 plasma. Great value over any I've seen in the brick and mortar retailers.
4,work well,"The saw works well, water pan dose not take all the water. I have to cut tile in a bathtub."
5,Great Price,"Overall, it was fairly easy to setup and all at the right price. The manual could have been better instead of a one-page small print. The screws really were of a good quality. They are just painted black, so they may only appear to be of lower quality screws. Couple of things: First make sure you have the tools needed before you begin the project. Make sure you have the wrench for the largest screws in the package used for the wall. The second thing to remember is that there are no Left and Right markings on the two arms. Make sure you install the correct one on the TV. The reason being that the arms have small safety screws that have to be tightened after the TV is hanged on the wall."
5,Incredible,"I too was skeptical but it turned out to be AWESOME, the integrated bubble level is genius, and the added holes in the frame allowed me to drill into the wall and hide all the wires , I had no problems with the screws provided and it holds my 50"" plasma with no wobble."
3,"Sturdy, good quality but too little space between tv and wall to plug in cables","Quality for the price is great. I also liked the built in buble level and the extra one provided. However, after mounting the TV I had little space, even after tilting the TV, to plug in the HDMI and AV cables. I had to unscrew the bottom screws that fastens the mount to the base in order to have enough space. I suggest improving their design to have the tilt part extend outward from the bottom to allow plugging cables then we can retract the TV with plugged cables backward closer to the wall."
5,Strong and Sturdy,Take 2 people to mount but the end result is great. Will surely buy again for another room. Highly recommend for the great price and free shipping.
4,Not for TV thicker than 1 inch,"I bought it for my Panasonic 58inch TV. I should have bought one made for a thicker TV. I hope this helps someone else not to make the same mistake. DO NOT TRUST the level, go buy a $3.00 one at home depot or whereever otherwise you won't really be level, not even close."
4,"Good mount, bad level... use your own","If you buy this, DON'T USE THE BUILT IN LEVELER. I did and had to take it down, as it was slanted. Use your own leveler, this one is JUNK. Crap product, big waste of time and unnecessary holes in the wall. Buy a different brand, there are many to choose from on Amazon."
5,well fitted,I purchased this wall mount from amazon after purchasing other ones from walmart mainly for the price. I must say that I am very pleased. The set up was easy and i installed it myself! Yes I am a woman and I can do anything a man can do and better! Thanks
5,Excellent value,"This is a stylish, easy-to-install, low-cost, but durable mount. The free HDMI cable and bubble level are a nice add-on..."
4,Get what you pay for,"The mount holds 47"" tv fine, no wobble no play, just beware when putting the 2 wall plates together to get the metal lined up or you cant get that little plastic cover over it. One side of the edge was slightly bent, and had an 1/8"" difference, but flipped it around and was fine. TV hasn't come crashing down yet."
3,Level Was Inaccurate !!!!,"This mount is great for the price but don't trust the built in level. I used it to get the mount perfectly level, but after drilling the final hole into the wall, the mount looked off so I placed my own level on top and it was miles off - literally 1/2"" too high on one side even though the air bubble in the built in mount was perfectly in the middle. The worst thing was that I was mounting onto a rock fireplace and it had taken me about 3/4 hour to drill each hole so starting over was completely out of the question. I ended up having to cut and file chunks of metal out of the mount to straighten it up. So quality control on these mounts is none existent. Don't be a fool like I was !!"
5,excellent for the price!,"I have a 37 in flatscreeen Tv. Other mounts of the exact same type were going for 65-100 bucks. This one is sturdy and works perfectly for my 37 inch Tv. For the price, it is awesome and I am a satisfied customer!"
2,Super hard to install!!!,"Definitely NOT a quality product!first of all, the back plate is very unbalance, one of the widths was almost half inches higher/longer than the other, causing it super difficult to level the mount.secondly, the screw packs that came with the TV mount did not fit! made me drove to home-depot to purchase the screws to make it fit."
2,Only mildly entertaining,"Dana's lines aren't bad in this tape, but caution to fans: he only has about ten minutes total of monologue, and that includes his interludes between each of the young comedians he presents. I was disappointed with what I expected to be a good routine from J. Garofalo (she has gotten much better since this performance). The last comedian was pretty funny but the other five ranged from so-so at best to flat out bad at worst. Searchers of novelty might think they would enjoy the pre-MTV Bill Bellamy, but he's arguably the worst of the bunch..."
4,okay game,My spanish student loves this game. She is 9 years old. I only wish there were more cards to play with.
5,I recommend this book to new parents,I work as an elementry school teacher. In my profession I see many children who unfortunatly have not received enough sensory motor training. Parents need to understand the importants of sensory integration. This book does a good job of explaning it.
2,"Tedious, boring and undeveloped","I read a LOT of chick lit and knowing they're not all Pulitzer worthy, I was surprised at how boring I found Confessions of a Nervous Shiksa. There's a LOT of skipping around in chronology which sometimes works but doesn't here, the characters seem undeveloped, and hello, the main character is mean to a dying dog. Maybe some find that to be not so bad but how does that make me want to keep reading about this person? By the end of the book I felt like the character hardly made any advances, and those that she did make were only revealed in the last 10 pages or so. Don't bother paying full price -- this one'll be remaindered soon and you'll find it at a used book sale or outlet store."
1,Beware of the chair!!!,I bought this as a decorative piece for our front yard. No one has ever sat on it but during a wind storm it fell over and the back legs broke off. So glad someone didn't sit on it because if it can't handle a little wind imagine what would have happened if it was sat upon.
5,Highly recommended,"I found this documentary film to be not only very humorous, but very enlightening as well."
5,Don't waste your money on lesser bulbs,"by the time you burn out your PIAAs, you will have gone through several Nokias and other brands. I know I cannot turn my headlights off in my Subaru (good) and if the car is on they are on and I do lots of driving. I was going though bulbs every 3 to 6 months and my PIAAs are into their second year. As Juan Valdez allegedly stated, ""You get what you pay for..."""
5,Very bright,Very bright / very yellow will light the road works greatness the fog also. If you are looking for bright yellow this is it..
5,Get what you pay for,More expensive but cannot compare the power and performance to others. Fog lamps are brighter than standard driving lights. Highly recommend.
5,Ion Crystal > HID,"Picked these up for my projected fog lights. Had 3000k HID's in there previously, and these definitely put out a crisper yellow with about equal output."
2,Color is not even and very orange,I bought this for the fogs on my 997 turbo and one side does not match the other and the color is very orange. I've had good success with prior piaa yellow bulbs but this has been a big disappointment
1,Not Proofread,"After reading the reviews of this book which stress the errors, and after seeing the errors in other McGraw-Hill products, I won't be buying this book. When I called the McGraw-Hill corporate office, they basically shrugged and seemed to cheerfully embrace their failure to proofread."
3,Graveyard Game,"Very creative concept. Wide scope - all of human history. Quite science fictionish with the cyborgs and all. At times very amusing. Not entirely satisfying. Ending rushed. Would prefer one terrific book to a series of books that are part killer and part filler, but I understand that a girl's gotta make a living. Better than your average bear."
5,good stuff for the player and listener,"This volume is nicely done, good short reads, fine music and history. You can read a few pages at a time or the whole thing on a quiet Saturday."
4,"With songs like ""Baby's on Fire,"" how can you go wrong?","Music by and with Bernard Butler, Johnny Greenwood (Radiohead), Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Mike Watt, Brian Eno, Pulp, and a LOT more that I am not as familiar with."
3,Playing with fire,"A good story except that the perpetrator becomes obvious too early in the story, otherwise a good read and with intrigue."
4,A real surprise,A well writen story that moved and kept my interest. I would read others as they are available. I don't however like the English words that don't mean anything to me.
3,o.k. for a biography of a vice cop,"THIS BOOK FOR THE FIRST FIFTY PAGES READS LIKE A EULOGY OF A VICE COP. THE REST OF THE BOOK HAS SOME GREAT STORIES ABOUT MCCARTHY'S EXPERIENCES AND CASES WHICH HE HAD WORKED ON. THE BEST QUOTES ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CHAPTER AND ARE KNOWN AS ""MOTHER'S MAXIMS"""
3,DVD-R QUALITY,I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH MY DVDR READING SOME OF THE DISKS I NEVER USED TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM BUT NOW IT IS HIT OR MISS. AFTER READING ON THE NET I FINALLY WHY. IT SEEMS MEMOREX DOES NOT GET THE DISKS FROM THE SAME SOURCE SO I DON'T ALWAYS GET GOOD 16X QUALITY DISKS
5,best buy,"so far these have done very well. I have found no coasters as of yet, but I have only used about 25 of the 300 ordered"
4,Printable DVD Media,"These are Memorex recordable DVD-R media with a printable surface for printing labels directly on the media. I have only used a few so far in a new EPSON Artisan 810 and they seem to work fine. You have to burn and verify the media, then insert the media into the printer to print the label. Not much to say about features and the like, they seem to work well and so far I have not had any data read/write errors when burning a data disc. Other reviews indicated a fair amount of rejects when creating discs in volume, but I have had no problem with the few that I do for archiving data files. Delivery was prompt and packaging was good. They seem to be a quality product that I would recommend to others."
1,50% Write Errors,I bought a 100 Pack and about half went in the trash I will never buy these again. If you want a good quality burn EVERY TIME try theseTDK Electronics 4.7GB/16x DVD-R (100-Pack Spindle)
1,Review of sender,"The product seems to be fine, but I ordered the wrong thing...I wanted cds and these were dvd's and I tried to exchange them but the seller refused...so I'm not too happy about that and will probably never order from that seller again!"
3,Good if not broken,"I ended up buying a factory reconditioned ice cream maker, but when I pulled it out of the box the bowl was leaking some strange unknown liquid. I sent it back immediately yet as of yet have not recieved my refund.(but assume that I will soon) I then went ahead and bought a brand new machine and it works great, no problems at all. If you want to read my review of that one go to the new Cuisinart ICE-20 page. So I would suggest that unless you want to test your luck you buy a new machine, but who knows maybe you will recieve your and it will work perfectly."
5,"Love it, love it, love it","I was a little skeptical to purchase this reconditioned ice cream maker because of some of the other reviews. However, this maker is GREAT! It looks brand new with no cosmetic blemishes, and works as if I just purchased a new one. We have made 6 batches of ice cream and only have had it three days. I am very thrilled with this purchase. Just remember to read the instruction book first... if you do that you can't go wrong."
4,Good Machine and can still be improved,We have ice cream every day w/ the help of a Blender.I have made different fresh fruit flavors using reduce fat milk & sweetener sugar and its a healthy diet for us old people here in an elderly nursing home.However I have to freeze them for a while to make it a harder cream.Its a good ice cream maker for homes and for those watching calories intake.
5,"Wonderful, soothing, calm, mood music","One of my favorite CD's of all time. I've given this as gifts and everyone loves it. A perfect CD to watch the sunset to. The first song starts with waves, then seagulls, then beautiful guitar music. The remainder of the CD continues the relaxed, beautiful mood. Not a country CD, just good music."
5,"good value, good product","Item seems to be a very good value for the cost. Heavier duty than expected, adequate length of rope for intended purpose - approx. 50 ft.. Quality construction."
1,out of this world,"pure crap!if i wanted weird sex stories ie, bigfoot sex, robot body sex welder guy, old cowboy and new rodeo cowboy-what crap! i thought it would be about alien planets and romance! i would not have bought this if i knew what it was about weird male/male sex."
3,Didn't work for me,"Sabatier Loire 8-Inch Bread KnifeI bake a three pound desem loaf in a cloche, 76% wheat & 24% rye freshly ground. This seems to require a thin serrated knife. The Victorinox 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, thin bladedVictorinox 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handleworks well making the first cut in the 8-9"" round, domed loaf. The heavier Sabatier knife is of no help cutting slices from the half loaf. It slides uncontrollably down the rounded side of it. An old common thin bladed stainless steel knife I hoped to replace with the Sabatier does a better job for me. I sent the Sabatier back to Amazon for credit--But it is well made. Doubtless it would work well on a standard white loaf or baguette."
5,Looks adorable on Annabell!!!!! By C. Fox,I saw the picture of Annabell wearing this on the U.S Zapf site and it is so cute! It is ideal for cold days as long as B.A's wearing long sleeves underneath it or she'll be cold. Best set ever for any size doll and I don't even own it yet (but I bet my My First Baby Annabell will love to wear it).
1,buyer beware of bootlegs,"IF you see this cover on the front with Jane hugging Rock Hudson's head, you will be hugging your own when you recieve GUESS WHAT!!?, a BOOTLEG DVD. the sound is terrible, and the color vibrates in and out like a psychedelic bad trip. I couldn't even a watch a full ten minutes, the picture was that awful, grainy fuzzy sound. Spend the money on a legit copy of this wonderful movie.BEWARE"
4,"A Page-Turner, though pretty negative","This is an incredible book - Caro lived in the Texas Hill Country for 5 years, interviewed Johnson's classmates and students (most of whom were still alive when this book was written in the 1980s), and paints an unforgettable picture of Texas politics, society, and above all, Lyndon Johnson. Caro paints a picture of domestic life in 1930s Texas that still lingers in my mind - a chapter called The Sad Irons. Warning: Johnson comes across in these pages as a monster; Caro is very negative. I am not sure if the succeeding volumes of Caro's Johnson bio are like this. In some cases, I thought it was overdone. Young Lyndon could not have been THAT bad! But if you have an interest in Texas, Johnson, or state politics in general, reach for this book. It will be hard to put down."
5,fantastic book would love to hear about volume III,"I loved the first two volumes of the Lyndon Johnson Years, but I haven't heard anything about volume III. If anyone knows anything please let me know."
2,Path to power,wrong book was sent. I was told I would receive credit but it hasn't happend Do not want replaceement Very poor service
5,GREAT READ,Caro's research is amazing but what makes the novel exceptional is Caro's writing. One of the best reads I have ever come across.
5,the path to power: the years of lyndon johnson,"thorough, interesting and well written.nice to it delivered wirelessly and weighing no more than the kindle. wish the prices were lower for non-print books."
2,Volume problem,"I should have believed the other reviewers who reported problems with volume. This headset just isn't loud enough (and I have normal hearing). With the phone volume set to maximum, and the headset volume control set to maximum, it was just barely loud enough--actually, slightly less than loud enough. I liked other aspects of the item, but a telephone headset you can't hear is useless. Maybe it will work with other phones (mine is a Panasonic cordless), but it certainly didn't work for me."
1,AAAARRRRGH!!!!!,"This headset is horrible. It curves the wrong way away from my face. It does not fit my ear AT ALL. The sound is very low at full volume, and the receiver hears clear distortion. I didn't even bother with MUTE, since I read all the reviews and had to laugh.This is going back so fast. On a scale of 1 to 10, this gets a minus 8. Caveat Emptor."
3,Building Expert System,"It's a good book to give you an overall understanding of an expert system. It's a great introduction and give you an idea how you might want your ES do. It uses accounting principles as examples for building an ES. It gives advices on needs from businesses that call for ES. It then gives you many programming languages you can use to build an ES, such as PROLOG, LISP, & OPS5 (which I haven't heard of). It introduces the ideas of Inference engine, knowledge-base, User-system interface, Explanation facility, and Knowledge acquisition facility. At end, it gives you a list of hardware and other conventional programming languages such as PASCAL & FORTRAN. It's an old book, so they don't apply for today's language such as C++ & Java. I hope they have revise the book to talk about GUI, Web base apps, and integration between PROLOG or LISP with Java, RealBasic, C++ or even Delphi (object pascal). For research purposes, this is a good enough book to get you start it."
2,a dissapointment compared to his last one .,what is this? Meth was so raw and hard-core on his first album and then this.i was really disapointed when i heard this.This was the one rapper i expeected to keep it real. and what the hell is with the cyborg gear?
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book focuses of the stories surrounding ten airplane crashes that killed famous singers/musicians...but it goes into a lot more than just the crashes...LOTS of ironies and strange facts surrounding the lives and crashes of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper, Patsy Cline, Otis Redding, Jim Croce, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ricky Nelson, John Denver and others. I kept yelling into the other room...""hey, honey did you ever know that...""Great read."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT A CHEAP JENGA SET!!!,"This is horrible. The pieces of this blatant Jenga knockoff arent even measured the same as the real Jenga game. they are cut in a way that makes you have to tediously and precisely stack the pieces so that proper spacing for weight distribution is attained. on top of that, the pieces are roughly cut and maybe even slightly warped, so sliding the pieces in and out of their places is both unpredictable and unreliable. Jengas pieces by comparison are completely flat on all sides and polished to a smooth finish. and they measure the proper size so that they can be stacked easily to play again and again without the hassle of spacing the pieces meticulously."
1,poor knock off,This is a very poorly made generic jenga. I didn't think it would make much difference but it does! The blocks don't line up in a nice tower. If you look closely at the picture there is a small space between each block. I returned this item and bought the real Jenga.
1,"Close, but no potatoe...","Gotta love spending a weekend lovingly rebuilding your motor to factory specs, then opening up the new timing cover you bought to make sure its done right and finding out that it has some serious flaws. The casting has two major problems: 1. The oil pump spec cannot be set correctly without having the outer cavity surface machined, even when installing brand new oil pump gears. 2. The water pump does not have the thermostat bypass machined into it as shown in Dorman's own pictures. Add to that the fact that the cavity is not deep enough for the impeller and you get one frustrated mechanic!I cannot find a water pump that will fit the casting. I left the oil pump clearance at .003"" over spec because I had no choice!! I need to get this done and back on the road! Thanks for nothing Dorman."
3,Midnight Bride,"I really like this book. A little mystery, a lot of love, and much suspence. It was a very good book!!"
5,Strongly recommended; good value.,"This is a remarkably good reference work, especially considering (or because?) it is the work of one person (and no doubt a good editor). The articles are long enough to cover complex topics yet focused enough to provide a handle on the subject. Muller has an excellent sense of proportion. He offers succinct synopses of technical matters without getting bogged down in stuff only an engineer would understand. You can get a quick overview of ""distance learning"" and ""outsourcing,"" on the one hand, or PCS 1900 and CDMA on the other. And all of it is very well and clearly written. Useful for anyone in the industry, or just for the curious."
3,pretty good for what it is,"...(The list of Wolfe's other books inside the cover doesn't include anything currently in print by the famous sf author). This is a mock sightseers guide to a fictional part of Chicago. While it is well written and entertaining, it is also very short and filled with illustrations, so there is not a whole lot to read. I would recomend it for light reading, however I would not recomend that anyone pay [$$$] for this small amount of literature."
1,Talk About A Dive Of A Movie,"Probably, the worst movie I ever saw. Not only did the plot diminish as the movie progressed, but the acting was ridiculous. This was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn't even that scary. More or less, it was stupid and the idea was very unclear. After watching it, I couldn't tell you what it was about. Well, Actually, it was about a house on haunted hill, but who didn't know that already. 5 people visit it and I bet you can quess what happens from here. They die, amazing. Yeah right. What ever happens to you don't and I mean don't, see this disgrace of a movie."
1,A thoroughly repulsive movie,"The original ""House on Haunted Hill"" was not a masterpiece by any means. It was a cheesy little B movie redeemed only by Vincent Price's usual delicious performance. When I saw Geoffrey Rush in a Vincent Price-type moustache and noted the resemblance between the two men, I wanted to see the talented Rush play what I thought would be the Vincent Price role. However, this movie turned out to be a dreadful, repulsive flop, and everyone involved in making it should be ashamed. It is filled with gratuitous profanity, awful music, stupid lines, and mediocre performances. It is even worse than the disappointing remake of ""The Haunting."" In fact, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Someone obviously just wanted to cash in."
3,A Fun and Spooky Ride!,"""House on Haunted Hill"" is a fairly decent horror flick based on the classic from 1958. It suffers from predictability and overdone special effects, but the cast (mainly Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen) is superb and convincing. There are lots of good scares in this film, as well as some cheap and expected thrills. The ending is ruined by overly ostentatious special effects that kind of nullify the good thrills throughout. All in all, ""House on Haunted Hill"" passes as a horror film."
2,The Haunting for adults.,What a shame! The first hour of HoHH is a genuine rollercoaster ride of thrills and some deeply disturbing visual and psychological scares (just what you want from a horror movie) but then after that it starts to rely only on it's special effects to scare. This is a shame as it could have been so much more if they had kept up the same level of psychological fear of the unseen. Instead they show us a black computer generated cloud which makes the whole thing seem like Jan de Bont's terrible The Haunting all over again.
3,A Fine Sample Of Twilght Zone Classics,"At the beginning of this horror movie , focus on the events. They are very likely to its original one.You think its the same of the first one but it's not because this time the rich person is also owner of theme park chains. Also when you see the machines and roller coasters in his parks you realize the madness of the film. You are scared a little but this is only beginning.This man invites five person to a house which is known as haunted and offers 1.000.000$ if they stay alive in there until morning. There is five person so five million dollars.Do you think they will murder each other and get each other's share? Don't be so sure!"
3,some very creepy moments and good special effects,"this movie was pretty good.lots of very scary scenes and everything but often boring but after an hour it stopped getting boring a lot and just had a lot of action and suspense.i was scared to death when i saw the ghost dribbling a head!this movie is not too gory.some friends of mine said this movie was weird but i understood it completely.a must see for ""the Haunting"" fans"
3,COULD OF BEEN BETTER,OK LETS GET IT STRAIGHT.. THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE IS REALLY COOL THE STORY OF A BROKEN DOWN INSANE ASILUME WITH A MURDEROUS GHOSTLY TOUCH.. BUT THE MOVIE COULD OF BEEN 50% BETTER! IF U LIKE THIS ONE YOU WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THE HAUNTING ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT A SCARY OLD HOUSE..
3,a very very scary movie!,despite the fact that everyone thought that they just had to curse their stupid heads off' the movie was the scariest movie ive ever seen!the way the ghosts moved was great' they moved quick' very scary!i would give it five stars' but the stupid cursing ruined the film for me' not everyone likes to hear that garbage.
4,Delivers the goods,"The story is about an old house that used to be an insane asylum where the evil doctor(Combs) used to carry out ungodly experiments on the inmates. The rollercoaster-king Steven H. Price(Rush) decides to throw a birthday party for his estranged wife(Jannsen), but upon arrival they find out that the guests invited are not the ones intended, but that they are all decendants of the personel at the old Asylum...and from here things begin to take shape.Apparantly the evil that took place in the house still lives there, and now it wants to get even.The movie seems very inspired by movies such as Hellraiser, at least in regard to the effects, and the mood. It does not quite reach the scaryness of Hellraiser, but it is at times very disturbing. The movie is very visual, and often grotesque relying heavily on the visual parts to make us jump. But as a whole the movie delivers what was intended, and it will give you some good scares. A must for fans of the genre!"
1,BORING BORING MOVIE,Come on people the plot was so lame and it was just like any other stupid movie where they get stuck in a house.But there in a crazy house.This did not scare me one bit.I thinks the best part was the very begging where the docters doing weird stuff I think thats the begging.The acting was good but nothing else.The special effects were bad with the ghost or whaterver it was.So my conclusion is don't see this movie!!!
1,BAD TASTE,"This is not a decent thriller. The is a lesson in inhuman treatment of helpless humans. This is something you might see in a death camp, but certainly not for entertainment. It isn't scary, just SICK. I wouldn't watch this again if they gave it to me. Get the original with Vincent Price. IT was good."
2,Liked the Beginning,"The best part of the movie was the beginning. I thought that they might actually have a good movie here. Unfortunately, they did not do such a great job. I won't go in to detail about my complaints, but I strongly believe that they could have made a very scary movie if they had done several things: 1) Laid off some of the computer-generated effects, like at the end 2)not focused so much on the feud between Price and his wife, it became annoying 3) used the crazy doctor more often. That one part of the movie (to all those who feel i will ruin the movie for them stop reading) where Rush enters the camera room and finds that the security guard's face is gone and then he sees the crazy doctor scared me to a great extent. It pains me to see a movie like this when i know it could have been so much better"
5,THIS IS THE *BEST* BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great great book!!! It's ful of pictures and is definatly the best biography of Michael Jackson!!!!!!!! Please if your a fan of MJ or just have a curiousity about him, read this book!!!!!!!!!! Keep Michaeling!~ A BIG fan!"
5,'Moonwalk' is worth every penny!,"His autobiography is SO deep and compelling. Michael goes into heavy detail of all the good, bad, funny, and intriging moments in his early career. Michael life is and should be told just the way it is in this autobio. I own the original autobiography which was given to me by a family friend who died early this year and is another reason why I'll NEVER give this away. I see a lot of myself in Michael and he is someone that everyone should look up to and respect."
5,A Good Ol' Video,"I got the DVD by mistake, but I'm sure that the good old VHS is much cheaper, and it doesn't need any extra, unneeded stuff. Have You Seen This Snail? was a fair episode, and the others, (as they were all from Season 4) were funny and worth it. Since videos are becoming obsolete, it's becoming harder to find now, but it's worth well to SpongeBob fans!"
5,AWESOME,A really great read! I couldn't put this book down! And I'm constantly saying things that I learned from the book that relate to real life.
2,dissapointed in person,"This watch dissapoints in person. The picture shows glimmering diamonds, but in person the screws on the bezel shine more than the diamonds. Don't buy this watch for the diamonds. I think I'll have to return it and keep shopping. These reviews are a little misleading and so it the average star level. I mean, I can't find a single diamond that's shiny even under the halogen light."
1,Didn't like it.,"This film features quite a lot of special effects and very little suspence and few scares. There is ridiculous B movie dialogue, the characters are all relentlessly unpleasant from the start for no reason, and there isn't much of a story. I never cared what happened to anyone in this movie, and it took a real effort to resist fast forwarding through much of it."
2,ST-3000 CHROMATIC TURNE,I PLAY A GUITAR FOR MY OWN PLEASURE AND ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE TUNNING MY GUITAR. THIS TUNER IS GREAT AND EASY TO USE. WHAT A DIFFERENCE PLAYING A PROPERLY TUNNED GUITAR.
1,Very bad!,I am a Siza Vieira's fan and for me this book is really bad compared to all book i know about Siza. How Taschen could authorized this book ?
2,DIsappointed in this Blue Oyster Cult effort,"After the unbeatable Fire of Unknown Origins, I guess I was surpised how Imaginos fared. How can you not compare a perfect recording like After Dark to any track of Imaginos and not come up wanting more?I want to like this album-others say it is great. But I don't hear it. And I do appreciate many other works of BOC--they seem to be the only band to rival the Beatles in coming with a new and inventive sound WITH EVERY SONG, not just one or another album. But many tracks of Imaginos--I forward to another track halfway in.THis album misses the mark, in part due to the high expectations created by other fabulous works."
1,I'm Imaginos-ing this didn't exist!,"What a debacle. Not sure how any self-respecting BOC fan could call this mess their best, let alone listen to it twice.I love this band, but this is absolute garbage. The story is an incoherent mess, the production is dreadful, even for 1988, and the assortment of studio hacks and some actual legendary guys only makes it more of a mess.This did not even start life as a BOC record and only ended up as one due to Columbia Records. Why did it bomb? Because it's awful, that's why. It limped to #122 on the charts and with good reason.Again, I truly love this band, but this is worse than sitting through 3 consecutive viewings of ""Ishtar"" baked with fire ants on my body.Nice job by American Beat though, restoring the proper credits and artwork. It was not remastered, but that wouldn't save this turkey anyway.Gobble gobble."
4,"""Imaginos"", not as strong, after 22 years.","I'm a life long Blue Oyster Cult fan from way back, in 1988 they released ""Imaginos"" #122, at the time I thought this was a tremendous record, but after 22 years of reflection, it's a 4 star release at best. This is a upgrade after ""Club Ninja"", but that wasn't very hard to do. The thing about ""Imaginos"", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88). I still like these songs after 22 years, ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""Magna Of Illusion"", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own ""Astronomy"" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic ""Blue Oyster Cult"", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best."
5,Awesome,"I was never that into BOC back in the day. I was so sick of hearing their ""hits"" (Reaper, Godzilla, etc) that it kept me from ever exploring their stuff. Then I stumbled onto this album...freaking unbelievable. I don't give a crap who's playing what or wrote what. Start to finish this album is an EXPERIENCE. I too had this on tape and I literally wore the thing out. And I'm still listening to it almost 15 years later. One of my fav albums of all time."
5,The road is life,"For those of us lucky enough to have had a two week vacation turn into a 15 month voyage through some far away continent, this film really hits home. I have never encountered a film or book that was able to capture the peace and harmony that comes from the constant excitement and enjoyment of being absolutely free and exploring a world known by so few.A great movie, for those that have been there."
4,Reliable and versatile,"This vibrator is small, like 4.5"" as it says above, which is OK. The problem is that the maximum speed is somewhat low: pleasing but not great. On the positive side, one AA battery does last for many uses, and it is so well made, that the one I had gave me years of carefree use. Also, its small size allows it to be strategically placed during that special one-on-one time.So, if you want a small, reliable vibrator, perhaps for your first one, then this is the one to get. We give it 4 stars for its reliability and versatility."
3,Newer isn't always better,"I recently purchased the new Epilady Legend to replace my Epilady Discreet. All I can say is: what happened Epilady people? The Legend doesn't have the power my Discreet had. When I used the Discreet on my legs they were hair free for a month at least. Recharging, plugging it in, nothing changes the lower and slower Legend. It feels the same to have your hair pulled out one by one, after a few minutes you don't notice so much. For me the Epilady is the way to go, but I was disappointed in this one. Being so slow it takes longer and time is precious to me. If you don't mind slower, buy one....it's still better than waxing or shaving any day."
4,"Good, but not as good as the old version","I have owned an Epilady for about 20 years. It is the old circular version and is wonderful, but it was time to replace it. I decided to go back to Epilady. It is great, but there is a learning curve. I can't go as fast and it seems to break some of the hairs, but since I've only used it a few times since my purchase I'm sure it will get better. It took me years to perfect the old one too. I LOVE the fact I can do my underarms too. Overall, I think the new lives up to the old and would gladly recommend it."
3,Disappointed,I bought the Epilady Lengend and I am not happy with it. It's fine if your hairs are long but if you are trying to get short hairs because you don't want to wait for the hairs to grow long this is not a good product.
2,Epilady Legend,I was disappointed using my new Epilady Legend. It mainly breaks the hairs just above the skin rather than pull it out by the roots. This leaves your legs rough and prickly with quick regrowth. On the other hand it is not very painfull.
4,Better than my battery powered one,"I bought this to replace my failing battery operated Emjoi, which in all fairness lasted many years and was half the price of this one. This one seems to work a little better and no more batteries to worry about. I like it!"
3,pretty much what i expected,"i'm constantly in search of the best hair removal method. i had laser on my armpits and bikini. and until i got the epilady, i waxed my legs. the epilady works about the same as waxing. it does not get every hair on the first try. the reason it is better than waxing is that you can grab it any time you notice a straggler. waxing is a pain having to get yourself all set up right after a shower. you don't have this problem with the epilady. and the pain thing shouldn't really be a factor in your decision. everything hurts that works. and i expected this to hurt more than it does. it is the least painful of any hair removal method i have ever tried. oh, and it's the cheapest too in the long run!"
2,Lacks major songs from the movie,"This soundtrack did not live up to my expectations. There were many songs that were in the movie that ended up being ommitted from the soundtrack. I bought it for ""Block Rocking Beats"" which was in the movie, but mysteriously enough was out of the soundtrack!"
3,so close!,"This CD hits on many levels, but misses out big time with the omission of Everything's ""Hooch."" I don't know why the song was omitted, but it is one of the best tracks from the movie. Buy 'Supernatural' by Everything to go with it... or you're missing an important piece of the soundtrack."
2,Very Frustrating,"The toy was purchased to be a joint project with a very mechanically inclined five year old boy. The product had no written instructions and very minimal diagrams. When constructing the large ferris wheel, it was very frustrating when it was not possible to duplicate both distal portinons of the wheels; and one of the wheels had to be fastened in one level. Better instructions including a written description of the construction steps on the larger projects would be a real plus.Erector Motorized Ferris Wheel Set, 477 Pieces"
5,Wish it worked better,"This globe looks really nice quality. However, it is very difficult to get it to spin, and nearly impossible to get it to spin for more than 10 minutes. It is suppose to spin indefinatly, but does not work that well."
3,Certainly haunting,"I had read so much about Sexton's dramatic readings and her absolute captivation of an audience through her reading. This tape, though, does not re-create that for me. It is infused with the drama characteristic of her performances, to be sure, but it is not the voice I expected from her and this somehow makes it disconcerting for me. She sounds (due to her habit of chain smoking much of her life) like an old woman, even though she was quite young. It's ok, but just not all that I expected."
2,Domenick's Opinion,"Boring. Slow. Predictable. Saving graces? Great Italian scenery, which you might as well concentrate on as the movie doesn't deseve that much attention. Even with his subtefuge I still don;t see why they woiuld becomne freinds with Matt Damon's charchter considering he came across as a stupid twit. Mr. Damon is a good actor so it must have been the directors perception of the role. Overall a waste of time."
5,Fine Story - Great Acting,"This is a solid story about two sisters who love each other, but due to one's transgression that hurt the other, there is still an open wound that needs to mend. A fine, much younger man seems to be the cure for the wounded older sister, but can she compete with the confidence and the schemes of the younger woman he came up from South Carolina to Harlem to find until he found comfort in the old settler. Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad are simply brilliant. Ms. Allen has a little comic inside. The handsome Bumper Robinson, who played Jackie Jackson in the movie ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"" plays the mannerly, country bumpkin precisely. The scene with actress Ella Joyce and comic Paul Mooney gives us the meaning of what an old settler is. The acting all around is stellar."
5,A must for any teacher!,All teachers should have a copy of this book! Its poems and prayers touch on just about any situation a teacher may run into. It is great for a quick pick me up during a difficult day. No teacher's library is complete without it!
4,Cute and silly story,This is a silly story that my son enjoys. My son is interested in crocodilians and loves the whole idea. Zack's uncle from the everglades sends him a key-chain alligator and she ends up growing into a real alligator when you add water. They get into a decent amount of mischief together and then head home for supper. All-in-all my opinion is that Zack's Alligator is a cute kid's story.
2,Sailing by the numbers,"If you are fascinated by the quest to mathematically model the various movements of a modern sailing yacht, or, if you ever wondered if there was an enigmatic way to solve six simultaneous equations then this is the book for you. The author derives a method for determining the speed potential of almost any sailboat and shows that his method produces the same results as classical methods and furthermore, his predicted speeds are in agreement with observations taken on at least two actual sail boats. For the average recreational or racing sailor there is very little of value in this book primarily because the author assumes a great deal of mathematical sophistication on the part of the reader, and fails to show what insights (if any) accrue from his methodology. Yacht designers may find this work usefull as a rough estimator of speed of proposed designs but beyond that the value of this work is murkey at best."
1,Not worth it,This toy does not work well at all. I guess its because this toy was second hand and despite that my son wanted this toy so badly.
4,It is all about the ART,"I loved this movie cause it shows that dedication and love for ones passion is a one way ticket to the top. Rickson gives his philosophy of life not just fighting. He is unbeatable in my book. He is the Bruce Lee of today. No one can beat him in freestyle fighting, who is tuffer than him? Check it out. made me want to learn to control my breath. the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because there is some down time when the other fighters are being shown. but well worth seeing this man do his thing."
4,Rickson makes this tape worthwhile,"This documentary is quite fascinating as long as it keeps focused on Rickson, who comes off as very charismatic and interesting. (When I watched it, I thought back to the old bodybuilding documentary, Pumping Iron, which was dominated by a young, charismatic Arnold Schwartzenegger). Rickson Gracie has that effect here. When it turns its attention to Todd Hays, etc. it gets a little boring, but it's worth it just to see the interviews and behind the scenes footage of Rickson. Highly motivational for us practitioners of jiu-jitsu."
5,Great Movie for True MMA Lovers,"This is a great look into the life of Rickson Gracie, the most legendary MMA fighter of all time. I strongly recommend this movie to any true MMA fighters....those that see beyond the octagon walls of the UFC.I wish that Rickson was about 10 - 15 years younger so that he was fighting in PRIDE now. He was the first of the well rounded fighters and I can only imagine what he could do if he was in his prime right now."
3,A lost World of Racists,"This is the sequel to Drums of Tapajos. Finally, after 50 years, I was able to finish the story. Col. MeekTroyanathrows a lot of pseudoscience at the reader in an effort to describe the survival of a slave holding civilization in the backwaters of the Amazon. This was written during an era where the racism he shows was a normal point of view for the majority of Americans, but he went beyond that to espouse a permanently stratified society of slave holders. He approved of the institution of slavery, which, even then, was far beyond the pale. Read it to see how far we have come in those years."
5,Awesome coffe maker,"Michael Graves Design(tm) Automatic Drip Coffeemaker - Black (40304)I found this coffee maker in Consumer Reports magazine....rated a ""best buy"". They were absolutely correct with this product. It is the very best coffee maker I have ever owned, and at a very reasonable price as well. It is easy to fill, easy to clean, has a host of wonderful features, and best of all, it makes great coffee!!"
4,Funny looking but good cup of coffee,"I bought this coffee maker based on it's good reviews. The positives: I really like the fact that you can remove the entire water reservoir and clean it. I automatically use the Flavor+ button every time I brew as it makes the brew a little stronger, which is a nice option to have. The pot has a no drip spout - that is a really great thing! I also love the blue light.I only have minor negatives: I, unlike many people who reviewed, think the machine is somewhat ugly. The big ""dial"" on the front reminds me of an old phone. The design looks somewhat whimsical compared to higher priced machines but it's nothing terribly important to me and its great features outweigh this.Finally, for the price, you can't beat it. I've enjoyed it for 1 month now and hope to have it a long time."
2,Don't Waste Your Money on this one,"This item looks very nice; however, it is a mess to clean-up the filter basket after the coffee has been made. Even though you're supposed to be able to leave the caraffe's lid closed and placed directly under the basket's valve, water continues to drip. During the percolation phase, water does not flow evenly, but sprays over the lid of the caraffe. I had to keep the lid open. Appearance isn't everything and you're better off looking elsewhere for an easy-clean coffee maker. Consumer Reports gives this item a high rating which is the reason why I bought it in the first place! I guess that Consumer Reports is better used for ""big ticket"" items and not for small appliances."
1,I wanna love this machine,"I like the way it looks and love that I can remove and replace the water reservoir thing,but it is very finicky, to the point that I was just thinking about replacing it after only a couple weeks.It's fine when it works but every thing about it has to be just so or the coffee won't drip. & the way it is designed, it is unclear that there is a problem until it's not making coffee. I've been using drip machines for over 20 years and never had this kind of issue before. I think it's the machine."
2,terrible carafe,"I purchased this coffee maker 6 months ago. so far I have had to replace the carafe twice. I have had drip coffee makers for years and understand the necessity of waiting for the pot to cool before you clean it.no matter how gentle I am the bottom just seems to develop these little cracks.BTW, yes, the coffee is very good, but the replacement cost for the carafe is high so I will no longer use this product."
1,Coleen Mad,"Very upset bought new,looked many places for this book, I had it for my youngest daughter.Bought for my granddaughter.cover damaged lift up flaps had to be taped back together. was an 8.95 book S & H TAX. NOW Became a 17.95 book. Was it worth it yes guess so.Amazon only place I could find it. My youngest loved it. I just hope it holds together long enough for my granddaughter to enjoy it. Won't be ordering any other books here though.Amazon new to me, like some things,and not some. The book was Monster Tales, Seaame Street"
5,I absolutely adore this little gem!!!!!!!!!,"There aren't words in the english language to describe this pop gem.This recording will definately ensnare you completey in it's grasp, from the very first song.Nick Laird cloud is an amazing song writer and puts to shame so called word poets like Dylan and Van Morrison.By far one of THE best recordings of the 20th century..A MUST!!!!"
1,Overrated Kuijen - avoid at all costs,"I bought the Kuijen after reading ecstatic reviews; it was a mistake. Kuijen's tone is harsh and the performance is more concerned with playing at top speed rather than lyricism. After listening to this CD, I played Heifetz' recording and was stunned by the contrast; Heifetz's tone and musicallity are mesmerizing. Avoid the Kuijen at all costs."
4,Hilarious!,"I bought this book for my now-husband when we first started dating. We both got a kick out of it.Mainly, it's a joke, tongue in cheek... though I know some ""nice guys"" who could use a little bit of the attitude in this book to help them out with women!"
4,Alive & Well,"To answer Billy Austin's question, Mason is alive and well and dividing his time between homes in Norway and Thailand. Still gigging constantly (Europe in the summer, Thailand in the winter) and practicing five hours a day. A lot of musos are making Thailand their home these days ...My favorite Mason CD is You Can't Win. Agree that the production of this one, Gypsy Blood, is a bit too 1980s, but the songwriting is top shelf as always."
3,Okay product,"This is an okay puzzle. I bought it for my two year old, he may just be too young for it still, but its not impressive."
5,Yeah!,Blue-Ray and David Suchet as Poirot....it doesn't get any better than this!...well maybe just a little if you add some popcorn!
2,Way Too Complicated,"I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds."
5,Delicious appetizers!,"This book was a real lifesaver when we recently had our first ""grown-up"" party. Almost all the appetizers I made came either from this book or Hugh Carpenter's ""Hot Appetizers"" (another winner). People kept asking who the caterer was (ME!) and are still talking about how wonderful the food was! (and I'm not even a very experienced cook) Besides the great pictures, I think the most helpful feature in the book is that each recipe is accompanied by ""plan ahead"" notes that tell you which parts of the recipe can be made days, weeks, or even months before the actual party. Very helpful when trying to coordinate a successful event. When we decided to have another party, this was the first book I reached for - it is indispensible!"
3,One for the Collector,"Hardly his best work, but ""Between Two Fires"" (annoyingly unavailable for so long) does reveal the talented 80's singer struggling with more mature and original material, a goal he would reach on ""Other Voices."" And where it works, it works well -- especially ""In the Long Run"" and ""Wonderland"". But the album, even in its newly remastered, two-disc version is only for the hard core Paul Young fan or serious collector of 80's music."
1,Bad,"If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media..."
5,Memorex 50 pack,Great price and great product. Used all 50 DVD's with out any issues. All 50 worked as they should. I recomend this.
2,Not recommended,"I know this sounds crazy, but while these disks generally burn fine and stand up to abuse, they won't stand up to a regular Sharpie marker! If I write on the disk, it promptly stops working. I've tried different burners (Dell, Apple, HP), I've tried different markers, I've tried other spindles of disks -- no difference, they're suddenly full of errors. The printable disks work fine, though..."
1,Every single disc was defective. Every one.,I was unable to use a single disc from this 50-pack for anything. I tried them on 2 different DVD recorders and 3 different computers. Every single one was defective.This is the second time this happened with Memorex. I will NEVER buy them again. I have since bought Philips DVD-R from Amazon and from a local store to use on the same machines that couldn't use the Memorex and had fine results.
1,"Useless media, unless you need coasters.","This media is totally useless. I bought 5 of the 50 disc spindles and WELL over half of them fail to burn properly. I actually thought my DVD writers were defective till I tried these discs in another computer and got the same results. I've used Memorex before and had no problems but I'll never buy them again. Save your money, time and nerves and buy a different brand."
3,blank devds,I received the dvds in plenty of time to complete the copies I needed and everything worked out quite fine.
1,Coasters,I would not buy Memorex DVDs ever again 50 pack I found almost one third are good for the garbage . I use them to record live music videos which I to do all over on every 3rd or 4th disc. Lance4919
5,Can't beat it,You can't beat this deal. They burn fine for me and are great for home videos. I also use them as an affordable way to share movies and music with friends and family. Get it while it's still in stock - you won't regret it.
5,good,this is a good product at this rate.The dvd's are good without scratches.I still dont know about the life of this dvd's as its still just 3-4 months ...but i think it would last longer and preserve my data
1,Worthless coasters,"I'm really disappointed with these Memorex DVD-Rs. The price was great, but they do not work at all with my NEC DVD burner. I tried multiple ones from different positions in the cakebox and nothing works. I'm using Sonic as the burning software and it just makes an attempt and then says it fails. I've tried burning through Windows and had the same results. I now have 50 worthless coasters sitting on my desk.I was not trying to burn any protected material. These are movies I took myself of our newborn son. Now I have to go try and buy another brand of media. I would return these to Amazon but the return shipping cost on my dime would cost more than I paid in the first place. Very unhappy."
1,failed 2 write,i tried to write using my new DVD writer 2 times and error message was showing unspecofied reason & failed to write...so my 2 blank DVD got damaged...i didn't try after that...
2,Good only for advanced pilates,"For someone who does pilates at an advanced level - this DVD is great. The customizable aspect is nice for keeping variety without having to own a ton of DVDs. If you are a beginner or casual pilates patron - this DVD is not for you. Even though they claim to have a person doing ""beginner"" level version of all of the exercises, the type of exercises that the instructor does are inherantly advanced. So even though there are modifications shown, they are way above the skill level of the casual pilates user. The progression is fast and intense, and the camera angles do not make it easy to follow the person doing the modified moves. If you are advanced and have very good strength, balance and endurance, then the speed and intensity of these workouts should be good for you."
4,Wonderful but...,I love this DVD it has some new exercises that I had not seen before. I feel great afterwards the only one thing is that it does not have a good warm up and cool down. Other than that it was very good.
4,Full work out,If you want a work out that focus on your arms and abs this is it. Be prepared to really work out and sweat..
3,"Beautiful women, poor print.","The print quality is just as bad as the previous reviewer stated. But the women are stunning, especially Joanna Cassidy (she did the snake dance in ""Blade Runner."")Other than that, there's not much else to say. But does anyone know who played Rebecca? She appears all too briefly at 9:10 of the DVD. Even IMDb couldn't identify her. This DVD has no listing telling us who played which character, which is typical of this cheapo product.Also noteworthy is Cathee Shirriff as Kate, a lady who likes ladies. She makes her first appearance at 20:51."
5,Warning,This book made me want to start my quest to visit ALL of the courthouses of Texas. This has become something of a burden to me now. Some of the most beautiful ones are quite remote. Be warned - when you see a really beautiful courthouse - you will want to see more.
1,Defective New Meter,"Upon turning on the unit for the first time, I was surprised to hear a loud, high-pitched oscillation emanating from the meter. Ignoring the oscillation, I proceeded to test the various functions of the meter. I tried to measure a number of resistors without success. I then attempted to measure voltages, again without success. The meter was obviously defective, so I decided to return the item to Amazon. I was most pleasantly surprised by the ease of returning the defective meter. I found the return process to be a quick, simple, straight-forward procedure."
4,Good enough for government work,"For the price, this multimeter is fine. I wish the fit and finish were better, but this multimeter does everything that Fluke does but at 1/5 th the price. But, of course, you get what you pay for. The fluke is a Rolls Royce and the Extech is a Ford."
3,Enter the Shadow...,"The 65-article anthology ""Meeting the Shadow"" is a mixed bag, with some articles the equivilent of fluffinutor, and others with rich and deep meaning for those searching for knowledge. This book did make me reconsider how I project onto others. This is a good psychological read, but some of the information is quite dated, as some articles are relevent mainly to the Cold War(It was written in 1990, but some articles are from the '70s.)."
4,a little mature?,"This bra is very very comfortable, and it wears well under clothing, but it looks 'a little matronly' on. It is also quite durable."
2,Not so great,"Neither my wife or myself are very impressed, to the point where we must be doing something wrong - we just can't figure out what. It doesn't work either of our abs, for me it creates lower back pain and hip flexor strain, for her its mostly an arm workout. We watched the cheapo video and read the book and followed all the instructions carefully. Even gave it a week or two for us to adjust to it. My old 90's ab roller is a better workout."
1,i cant play this game,"i bought this game and now i have no way to play it because my grapgics card isnt good enough and amazon makes it imposable to make a return because they hired an idiot to design thier site, anyone who wet to a computer career school know that a contact number and email should be visamle and easy to find from the home page... i cant find a number or email at all"
3,Well Trod Path Has Some Highlights To Enliven It,"This gets an extra star for the infectious ""Brand New Lover"" a song by DOA that I never tire of hearing! The longer it is, the better it gets! If you only know the 7"" edit, the album version features a great guitar solo that adds quite a bit to the number. Elsewhere, ""Something In My House"" drags on for too long. ""Special Star"" should have been a single. It was certainly catchy enough, but the PWL production on his album works against it. Once they parted with Pete Waterman, their own self-productions would be less formulaic and finally do their songs justice."
5,"Love, Love, Love","Only one word can describe how I feel about Grey's Amatomy in general and that word is LOVE. I think this has to be the best show on television. I bought the first season, even though I had already seen them all but, after watching them like 5 times each I realized that I would find something new each time. I can't wait until season 2 is released, I will be one of the firsts ones to buy it. I cry every time I watch a show, the worst one was when the guy from the bomb squad exploded, I couldn't believe it, I thought Meredith was dreaming.Well that's it.5 stars Baby!!!!"
5,Not just another hospital show,"Grey's Anatomy is one of the best shows on T.V. right now. It's new, fresh, and always exciting. I haven't missed an episode since the first one and I'm so glad. I can't wait until this box set comes out so I can rush out and buy it!"
4,Greys Anatmony DVD,"I love the DVD, I knew I missed some episodes and this was a way to fill in the blanks. The only dissapoinment is that after each episode you have to turn off the closed caption feature."
5,There are no words!,"This series is completely mind blowing, funny, good actors. I received the season and watched in one day. I could not get away from it. It's a must have."
5,Outstanding,"Gray' Anatomay is a wonderful series. With Meredith it is so funny when things go wrong with her or she get upset what she dose is sleeps with every Tom, Dick, Harry that comes into a bar just to get herself back on track again lol, Hey I never thought of that . But what can I say what ever works for people to handle life lol.Then she meets up with Dreamys wife lord lol. But she dose slow down when she with Dreamy but that dose not take place any time soon. All in all very good show"
5,ER was over and Grey's was born!,One of the best new dramas ever! Season 1 was really fun. I watched the whole thing over two days :)
4,Perfect Birthday gift,My daughter loves Greys Anatomy but was not allowed during the school year to stay up late to watch it. This has filled her in on the earlier seasons quite nicely!
3,MEDIOCRE MEDICINE,"Grays Anatomy is not a pimple on denny Crane's big fat ass. As a hospital show It it worse than ER. Worse than St. Elsewhere. Worse than Scrubs. I do give it a slight edge on General Hospital, but I am sure this is only because of the respective budgets involved. The Seattle tie in is NOT realistic and badly done. As is typical you can see the Pike market sign out the hospital window and the writers toss in Seattle buzz words inappropriately. Some jerk-off middle management type at ABC has his carrier on the line over the success of Greys and knows it can only make it on the coattails of Desperate Housewives."
3,No Cliche Goes Unturned,"Grey's Anatomy milks every tired cliche ever invented by the soap opera genre. Expect to be entertained - but never surprised. What have we got? A former model turned surgeon who must prove her worth, a star intern who falls for the (gasp!) brain surgeon (who used to ride a motorcycle and listens to The Clash), the aggressively ambitious Asian American woman, the frat boy with a sensitive soul (who falls for the ex-model), sleeping with your boss and getting pregnant, etc. You name it, Grey's Anatomy's got it. Sometimes, it feels like an insult to your intelligence, especially when Meredits does voiceovers: ""Adulthood means responsibility... and responsibility sucks."" No kidding."
4,Grey's Anatomy,"This is one of my must see shows. I enjoyed viewing the season in its entirety. They advertised 19 unaired scenes, and I don't think that there were quite that many, so I was a little disappointed with that part."
4,Grey's Anatomy - Season One,Great to have or to give as a gift for any Grey's Anatomy fan. The character development and writing on the show is terrific. Everyone should be a fan of Grey's.
4,Fan of Grey's Anatomy,"It was very exciting. However, 9 episodes, that was too short. I wanted more from it. Looking forward to season 2."
1,Yuck!,I hate this show!!!! This show is disgustingly gross...doctors falling in love with each other...get a life! Sandra Oh gets on my nerves...she's so overly serious and it just makes me nervous. This show is crummy. Don't waste your money!
3,One of the best TV show but not realistic,"I absolutely LOVE this show for its drama and well-written plots. But as a nurse, I know that alot of its contents are not true. The best TV show but the worst show for portraiting nurses and other medical personnel. But with hot actors like Patrick Dempsey and Isiah Washington, who cares!"
4,Cherry Finish Wood Round Turning Swivel CD Rack,"Slim profile, attractive wood, useful swivel design, handy for storage.Personal preference for cd/dvd only unit of similar configuration but one was not readily available.Professional, courteous company for questions and shipment."
1,Worked great...until I updated the software. And then it was dead.,"Warning: DO NOT UPDATE THE SOFTWARE if you buy this. After 15 minutes of downloading, my pen was rendered completely useless -- and my kid heartbroken and crying. Can't even reset it -- it just seems to have destroyed the pen. I assumed that Oregon Scientific was a good name, but good God, look at the reviews of this thing. Way to destroy the brand, folks."
2,Don't buy this if you plan on updating it,This toy is great to start. But when you have to update (reason we bought it) it does not work. Have tried MANY times to get with customer service (emails and phone calls). They keep having all these funny solutions - NONE of which work. They now want me to buy a new pen because the newest pens don't have issues updating with the new software for download. Sounds like a problem on the company's end. NOT WORTH the purchase price. Don't buy from Oregon Scientific. I have seen MANY reviews about issues with the customer service they provide and I can see why. I now have a couple hundred dollar useless globe with out of date information on it.
3,Doesn't stand well on its own,"The chapters in Conversational Spanish present typical dialogue and vocabulary to negotiate many everyday situations: social interactions, the post office, an airport, the bank, and a restaurant to name a few. The text also provides some cultural background, but the book will likely fall short for readers without the support of Spanish classes which cover grammar and provide more extensive information about the cultures in which Spanish is spoken. The language is at a beginning level parallel to the first two semesters of college Spanish.Conversational Spanish is a suitable textbook for the first year college student who wants to supplement his studies with additional practice in conversation in a classroom setting."
3,for cbs shows I mean come on if this is going to made on dvd then why not make close to home on dvd too,cbs you better get your act togther because I rate this 3 stars because of the fact that im waiting for close to home to come out on dvd im sure cold case is great for fans of the show im mad but im sorry I watch close to home which I think is better and should get better treatment but cbs just treats it's less then it's other shows heck ghost whisiper is out as is numbers and so on please make close to home on dvd I will buy in a heart beat
5,Don't we think it's time to get this to DVD/Blu-Ray?,"Really now, the show has been over for nearly a year, surely some sort of settlement can be reached about the music? You wouldn't think it would be that much of an issue; I for one bought CD's of artists I'd never even heard of until they were featured on Cold Case, so if anything it increases their revenue. PLEEEEEASE get this out ASAP!"
5,Anticipation...,"What sets this show apart is the way the music sets the scene for each of the flashback scenarios. Every time I watch the show, I'm reminded of how well this particular aspect of the series is carried out. Without the music, Cold Case would be a just another solid detective show with interesting storylines and likable characters. I always seem to be watching it during bouts of insomnia, at 2:00, 3:00, or 4:00 in the morning, so I'm really looking forward to having the episodes on DVD."
5,anna,"I happened acrossed this show one day when they were doing a mini marathonI fell in love with this show. I was surpised when I went to buy the series that it was not avaible. I read all the post and now know why it's not,but I'm for one is willing to pay a higher cost if it encludes the orignal music. The music is a number one reason why I fell for this show, I also love the way they go from past to present. When I hear a certin period piece I'm right there. Come on and get this show on DVD I would buy all of them! Thanks for listing.....anna"
3,HENDRIX AND THE BAND OF GYPSY,"This DVD should have been more concert material. Instead its more about interviews with people like Lenny Kravits, also Eddie Kramer. This DVD covers some concert material I think the CD was alot better than the DVD. I rated it 3 stars and no more because its an average DVD. The Band Of Gypsys were powerful the footage includes Machine Gun, Foxy Lady, and a few others ENJOY!!!!!!!"
3,Too much talk interrupting the music!,"I just completed viewing this DVD, and I must say it has left me a bit cool, particularly the documentary portion. While it had its highlights (Eddie Kramer especially), I was somewhat bothered by the ""African-American band (BOG)"" versus ""white band (Experience)"" political stuff. This is shame because Jimi's music transcended such issues- and that's what it should be about: the music. Instead they are cutting into the middle af great rare footage with rather uninsightful commentary by various guys like Don Cornelius (!). The B&W footage is basically amateur-video quality, with them panning and zooming all over the place. The performance is of course excellent, and this alone makes it probably worth the price of admission."
4,Watch the interviews once and ENJOY THE CONCERT!,"When I was 15 years old and in mt cousins' basement as we rocked out to ""Power of Soul,"" ""Message to Love,"" ""Who Knows,"" etc in the late 70s-early 80s, I often longed to see film of this concert whose music moved me so much them and now. When I saw the 1973 ""Jimi Hendrix"" documetnary, my jaw DROPPED to see a snippet of James Marshall Hendrix doing his thing with MACHINE GUN from this concert! I wondered if the whole thing would ever be available on DVD or VCR, especially since I learned my beloved Voices of East Harlem was the opening act.Well, the VOEH appear only breifly in a snippet during the documentary section, but you have the Band of Gypsys Concert on DVD! Forget the interviews filled with second guesses and Monday morning quarterbacking! Enjoy the show and ROCK ON!"
3,What were they thinking?,"I loved seeing this footage but why must they destroy His solos? Especially in 'Machine Gun' Can't they just let us see Him play? I don't really care what those people had to say or think about Jimi, I bought the tape to see the footage of the Band of Gypsy's, not to hear some people's thought on Jimi. Can't anyone, besides bootleggers, give us what we want!? Complete shows! Not just some of the highlites."
3,"Not a bad way to start playing bass, especially if you have no money.","I bought this bass package a few years ago on ebay. It comes with pretty much everything you need to start playing: a bass, a cord, a stand, a strap, etc. The amp was pretty lame, it ended up being a woefully small guitar amp that I soon replaced. The DVD was particularly helpful, and in my opinion the best part of the package. As for the bass itself, it worked fine for the first several months or so. After my extensive use, knobs started falling off, wires came undone, etc. With little knowledge of electronics I was able to fix everything for a while, until I had to take out all the knobs and electronics to keep it working. It still works now, I gave to my friend so he could learn, and it still serves its intended purpose, but not much more. For the price (I paid about 60 bucks plus shipping) it was totally worth it. Expect a bass to learn on, with all the needed accessories."
2,Very disappointed!,"I had purchased this book to give as a gift to some friends who are adopting and was so disappointed in the book that I returned it instead of giving it as a gift. From the poem titles listed you would think that the poems were very touching and emotional, perfect for anyone adopting or touched by adoption, but in fact it was just the opposite. I couldn't help but think while reading some of the poems that they were very depressing. They mainly focused on the negative topics of adoption and were not the types of poems that would touch someone while reading them. Sorry to disappoint!"
5,great book!,"I have always enjoyed reading about BigFoot, sea serpents, UFOs, ghosts and other so-called ""mysteries."" Some books are pure trash, but I found Mr. Floyd's book a thoroughly pleasurable experience. It's history and science and mythology and religion all rolled into one. It gets right to the point and does not stray, as do so many books that try to cover this material. The writing style is pure bliss--but packs a punch and leads the reader panting for more information. One thing about this book is that the author does not appear to draw preposterous conclusions; he leaves that up to the reader. Each one of these articles would make a nice book in its own right. Both of my teenagers have read this book and have recommended it to their friends. Just thought you'd like to know!"
4,Good waterproof glove,I bought these gloves thinking that they were thinner than they are. The material is great for water resistance but not good with wind resistance or dexterity. The grip material on the palm and fingers is somewhat slick but may improve when submerged. So if you plan to buy then make sure that these are used for underwater use because that is what they are designed for.
4,Great Fit,"Using these for kiteboarding on Lake Michigan. Went out on Nov. 1 - the water was about 48 - 49 degrees, air temp was 45. My hands stayed comfortable and I was out for almost two hours. I like the quality and finish of these gloves."
5,Great Product,Product was shipped on time. Product seems to have great qulaity. The user seems to like the product and says it works well (ordered as a gift)
1,A waste of your time and money,"The amount of matter which the author has repeated again and again if you minus all that repeated matter, the book would hardly be of about a 100 pages .. Don't even borrow to read it .."
4,"Good game, but not great...","Just from looking at the price you can understand that this isn't a high budget game, but it achieves its purpose by allowing the player to sit in the 'hot seat' and answer questions about sports delivered by ESPN's own hosts and anchors. There could be more questions, and the game could be a bit more realistic, but overall, it's a pretty solid game for the price you pay. If you like Kenny Mayne (like I do) or just sports in general, you should try this game out!"
4,This has better Audio than the 2005 version.,"While the 2005 version has the complete concert, this 1999 version has its stereo soundtrack mastered at 448 kbps, while the 2005 stereo soundtrack is at 198 kbps. This results in that the 1999 one has more headroom and dynamic range and less compression then the 2005 version."
3,Abbreviated Concert Experience,"From what I've read on the Experience Hendrix website, a new Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock DVD will soon be released (Sept 13th, 2005) which features more tracks, bonus material, and even a 2nd DVD containing black-and-white footage of the show filmed by a guy who was on the front row. My advice is: WAIT. Don't buy this version. Buy the Deluxe Edition that comes out in a month."
5,You gotta buy this,"This product is absolutely the best. The package has a quote that says something like, ""My child was riding all by themselves in less than 15 minutes"". Yeah, yeah - I didn't believe it at all, but lo and behold, the darn thing worked like a charm. Find a friend to split the cost, if you can, because you'll only be needing it for less than an hour."
3,Work Out Top,"I bought this shirt to wear to the gym - but it runs very small and is tighter than I had hoped for. I am keeping the product, however, because I can always use it to ""layer"" under other items when the weather gets cool. The product is well made and did not run or shrink in the laundry process."
5,Ah-maze-ing!!,Has become my favorite new shirt! I bought a medium because I read the reviews and they said Bella ran small but I received a medium lol it wasn a wrong size at all
2,Meh,"I love the colors on this top, but it fit really weird. Unless you are really wide, it will have a weird fit on you.Wish it was made more for a normal shape."
3,"Definitely not a ""secrets"" or a ""design"" book","I agree with other reviews in that there are many errors in the book which should have been discovered and corrected before printing. It's not one of the worst books on the subject, but certainly not the best. The book is fun to read but is short on depth. It actually reads like a bunch of magazine article reprints that have been collected and assigned a chapter with some extra stuff thrown in. Some chapters have a lot of detail and others completely gloss over the subject (just like some magazine articles I have read). If you are looking for a general introduction to RF principles, then this book is just OK. If you are ready to get the simulator going and design a real RF circuit, you will be a bit hard pressed to make progress."
2,Stay with Chessmaster 7000 and save your money,"One of the appeals to Chessmaster used to be the ""auto-annotation"" mode so a player could enter a game and Chessmaster would analyze move by move and offer better moves. This feature made Chessmaster worthwhile.Then came 8000. This feature is gone. Chessmaster will analyze the game but you can not print it out. Bummer!!!!While the tutorials are nice, they are not that much better than the 7000 so why spend the extra money.Of course, there are the problems with more advanced Windows operating systems and now why buy this product at all. If you are a parent trying to teach your children to play, look for Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess. A far superior product."
4,Running on xp had to get around 16 bit error notice.,"I bought the game years ago for my old computer with windows 98. I loaded it onto my dell xps 400 and got an error and it wanted me to reset my graphics to 16 bit. The fix was to go to the Chessmaster folder, right click on the executable (horse symbol),click on properties. Under proporties go to the compatability tab and clear the checks out of all the boxs. Start the game. I enjoyed the game on the '98 machine and after playing a few on the new machine and downloading the latest update it seems to work fine. The auto annotaion and the ability to watch historic games is neat. This is the first non-dos chess game I've owned so I don't have anything to compare it to. It seems to work like it is supposed to. I will try and keep this post updated."
5,Worth it,It plays well and has many choices. My favorite part is the Kids Room. It is fun and has many different levels to choose from. I reccomend you get this game now!!!
2,Sounds like they are playing on old instrument.,This group really sounds like they are playing on old brass instruments. They should really try to find some newer horns. I think it would sound much better!
1,terrible,I thought it was boring.I didnt like the concept of it was too jewish. I didnt like they made jews too strict. I didnt like the way they made the customs. I didnt like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions. For example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath. I could understand it because i am an orthdox jew. because i have gone to yeshiva. Most non jewish pepole cant understand the movie. As well as non orthdox jews.Boaz yakin had no right makin the movie like this. he should make a sequel to learn from his mistakes to make it a public movie. I wish i were in show business to make the movie more normal.
4,Voyeuristic,I find this movie very soapy and the cash business within the community is fascinating. I have no idea if this movie is offensive to the Orthodox Jewish community but I am just nosy.
4,Excellent book for the cooker in all of us,I really enjoyed reading this book as well as the recipes in it.There are hints in here that modernize the recipes.I love the stories behind the cooks too!
1,JUNK,This is a total waste of money! I bought one and it lasted 4 months! You get what you pay for I guess.
3,An exploration and enlightening,"Dr. Susan Okie offers an exploration of the many causes of obesity, as well as some of the attempted cures. Although not earth shattering this is a comprehensive analysis of a pervasive problem.Claire Dorotik M.A. author ALL KIDS ARE BORN THIN: A Parent's Guide to Understanding and Preventing Childhood Obesity"
2,Dimmensions Needlecrafts Paintworks/Pencil by Number,One of things I don't like about this Pencil by Number Flower and Pets Variety Pack is that the drawing was too light for me to make out enough to color. I could hardly see what was printed on there. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it.
1,ZERO Stars!,"This game is the biggest disappointment I've ever seen, and being an avid fan of the Gold Box series, it doubly hurts.Beware at your own risk if you buy this one. And don't even try if you are running 2000/XP. According to Ubi Soft, these are ""Business"" operating systems, and we should not expect to run their games on a business operating system.But I was asking them about XP Home? Last I checked, that wasn't considered by Micro$oft to be a business operating system.It's this arrogance and negligence by Ubi Soft that will convince me never to buy another game from them again.Anybody want an opened, unused version of POR?"
1,Sloooow and boooring,I have really been looking forward to a new SSI D&D game. A good old fashioned dungeon crawl with awesome graphics sounded like a lot of fun. It should be. It really should be.It isn't. The problems?The customization of characters is very limited. You get to create four cookie cutter characters. You might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it. The game action is terribly slow. It takes forever to get anywhere. By the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can't stand it. I bought this game the day it came out and I have been trying to like it every since. I have just given up. That's $40 I will never see again. Oh well lesson learned.By the way the music is pretty good and the movement (slow as it is) is fluid and life-like. I also have had no problems with crashes but then I have a fairly high end system.I wouldn't buy this game unless you are a very patient person. I reccomend instead Baldur's Gate II.
1,Don't buy it!,"Thousands of user complaints about incompatibility with their systems, severely curtailed ability to customize the graphics and sound, reduced implementation of promised features, and little incentive to roleplay within the game are just a few reasons to avoid it.This is probably the worst implementation I've ever seen. Go buy Baldur's Gate instead."
2,I waited for this??,"I agree with the other reviewers -- let down! Interplay has set the standard with the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series. This game can't hold a candle to them. Time to pray to the Interplay/Black Isle Gods and hope they keep the great D&D games rolling.Lack of in depth story, clunker of a combat system, navigation limited to monitor display are all problems. What's so great about the graphics anyways?Somebody please tell me this is not what the Third Edition Rules have turned the game into. This game must have suffered from some serious mission creep. How else can you explain it?"
1,This gane really sucks,"What a letdown!I love all of the old SSI D&D; games, but this is terribleI thought I might look up this game's review since my party is stuck!I should have read all of the bad reviews before I bought thisSpecial Note, Ubisoft produced or created(or whatever) this game, and another piece of dung called Battle Realms(just as buggy, no patches)I think Ubisoft just churms out games before they are ready"
2,Slow gameplay and Game crashes,"I am a huge fan of the original gold box games and was hoping this would be a revamp of those. Although the turn based combat is reminicent of those old beloved games that is where the simularities end. The navigation system is terrible and slow. The combat is slow, and there is not enough random action...."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this game--a real D&D 3rd Ed game. It started out fun, for the first few days. However, I soon realized that I was playing the same game over and over again, in different, but very similar areas with higher level players and monsters. I will say that I really enjoyed the graphics and the combat system. Magic is prety cool as well. And the outside areas of the game are fun. But this is mostly an underground dungeon quest and the dungeons are essentially the same. I finally reached a point where I was bored stiff and quit playing. I never finished the game, and I had been playing for weeks. I started with eager anticipation, ended up extremely disappointed in the almost endless repetition of the game."
2,Where's the plot,"The designers of this game seemed to have forgotten the storyline in their rush to create as many bad guys as possible. All the rooms are the same, and the game quickly becomes five levels of find orcs, kill orcs, find aombies, kill zombies. The entire game is spent in battle, and only in the last half of the game do you get to go somwhere outside and different. Overall, the plot is weak and you just battle, rest, battle, rest, etc. the sorcere's ability is nice, since you don't have to memorize specific spells, and its always nice to blasta group of drow with a wand of cone of cold, but the game is very underveloped and patch dependant."
1,"Shame there's not a ""0"" star rating!",I purchased this game for $4.99 and I would have to say that I really got my moneys worth in annoyance and utter frustration. I have installed the game twice and have the newest patches installed as well. On both occassions the game will tease me with 20-30 hours of game time and then crash when I save. THIS CRASH WILL CORRUPT ALL SAVE FILES AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO START FROM SCRATCH OR UNINSTALL!!! The only positive I can say about this game is that I was somewhat happy when I snapped the disk in two. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
1,A nice paperweight!,"Actually it's not that heavy, so it's not a good paperweight.0 stars! I think everyone else summed up most the flaws pretty well."
1,A major disappointment,"I got it after waiting for A WHOLE YEAR since pre-order... The original release date was Feb 2001! Anyway, even after half a year more in development time, the game still sucks. Yes, I like BG2 system more. Even though the graphics of PoR is better, my characters run like snails. Morever, I *** cannot *** customize my character! All new character, no matter what class you choose, has the definite 19 points to share amongst all skills. This kind of character creation really push me away... especially when you like to customize your own character. Yes, I do, and so do my friend! So, after the first battle, the game go to eBay. Do not waste your money on this."
1,Don't waste 50 bucks like I did!!,"Ok, Ive played most rpgs out there (many good many bad), I have to say, this one stunk. I played the orrigional once and it was more enjoyable. Pool of Radiance: RMD is nothing more than an excruiatingly dull dungeon crawl. The graphics are ok, but then they arent everything. The game got a little sticky during battles (running on a 1.8 gig pentium 4 processor) even after I defragmented my hard drive. If you want to spend some money on a good rpg, then buy Arcanum or one of the Bauldr's Gate games. Don't waist it here. *tosses Pool of Raiance on top of a copy of ""Jurassic Park: Tresspasser""*"
5,"They don't last as long, but it's worth it","We bought this product partially for using vibrating infant seats also. The reason NiMH batteries don't run as long is that they cannot store as much energy as alkalines. The Energizer technical data sheets state that the energy storage capacity is:Alk vs Rech - AAA 1150 vs 650, AA 2850 vs 1200, C 8350 vs 2200, D 18000 vs 2200, 9V 595 vs 150 (units are milli-Amp-Hours)So, even though alkalines D cells will last about 8 times longer and they cost half as much, if you can get 20 charges out of a NiMH, it is worth it. Since NiMHs supposedly have a 500-1000 recharge life cycle, it's very much worth it to us to change the D cells 8 times more often! For the AAAs and AAs the difference is much less and even more worth it!"
3,OK charger but there are better for the same price.,"This charger works ok, but simply charges for 5 hours then stops regardless of whether the battery needed 5 hours of charging or not.The Millenium 5 hour charger detects the charge state of the batteries and charges them to full then shuts down, so no overcharging or undercharging. This is a much better system, I own both and don't use the Energizer anymore."
2,"Not as ""smart"" as other rechargers",My neighbor and I bought this charger but I returned mine and I think she is going to return hers also. It seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time (both NiMH and NiCad). So if your battery is only slightly discharged it'll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead. It also can't charge batteries individually which my Rayovac charger can. The only downfall of my Rayovac is that it can only charge AA and AAA which is all I need. I paid 25 dollars for the Energizer and the Rayovac was only 10 dollars... BIG difference. If you can find a Rayovac recharger at your local store get it! I even got 16 NiMH batteries for 25 dollars - PLUS they're ALL 1600mah (higher the rating the more power). Just thought I'd let everyone know. Alohaz
3,very handy yet no meter,this charger is good because it works on all the battery sizes but there is no meter to tell if the charging is done. also on the first usage i had to wiggle my 'd' batteries in the charger to get it working...
4,good movie,"good family movie (age 10+), good acting, relevant for these times too, keeps you suspense,the dolphins are beautiful to watch."
2,Watch out for the version 6 upgrade!!,"Hey, I've used ZoneAlarm for years and agree that it's a fairly good firewall for the money. However, watch out for the latest version (version 6)!! It hosed my computer. It forgot all the settings I've had on it for the past five or so years. Every application on my computer that accesses the internet is no longer working including Internet Explorer and my email. They added this new feature Smart Defense that doesn't seem too smart so far. They also changed all your program permissions to Block. You have to physically go in and change them back to Ask just to get it to prompt you for access to the internet. Then they amazing broke the Remember this Setting option so it prompts you again and again. Anyway, you get the picture and I can sleep knowing you have been warned. The latest upgrade is terrible."
3,"Disney at it's prime, unfortunatly not all of the time!","I've expected a lot from these 3 DVD's but after viewing 'em all I was a bit dissapointed.The first DVD: Fantasia is still beautifull ;) but the extra features on the DVD were almost non-existent. Nevertheless a price to own on DVD.The Second DVD: Fantasia 2000 was rather dissapointing in it's overall aspect. The movie approx. 68 mins is about half the original Fantasia's length. 1 Feature shows the original The Apprentice. There was only 1 Feature I loved but that one was worth the DVD! ;) There were many extra features but not impressive..The third DVD: Fantasia Legacy well... it has to be examined closer. Excessive features but from as far as I've seen: not easy accessible.If you don't own the orginal Fantasia (it's the 60th anniversery version) on DVD yet, well buy that box. If you do own it, well then it's up to you."
4,"Not perfect, but greatness nonetheless","The other reviewers are right. The silly (and at this point futile) cropping of the ""offensive"" scene in ""pastoral"" is sill there, and Deems Taylor may as well be nonexistent without that sonorous voice (which you may recall if you watched the VHS of this film, or saw one of it's rereleases).That being said, the audio and video remastering is quite good- though if Disney thought there was any money in it, they could do better. And the extras are actually interesting- unlike most of the tripe they package into Disney special editions. The ""extended"" (or roadshow cut) is also very intersting, but since I grew up with the shorter-running-time VHS version, this one seems a little on the long side. But I'm not going to complain about more of this spectacular film.At it's heart this is a triumph of film and particularly of animation. It is a valuable addition to any collection."
1,Don't bother,This dvd is boring. The instructors do not deliver the material in a way that makes you want to learn.
3,"Not really 9V, long charge times, short life","I purchased these batteries to use in a small baby monitor that requires 9-volt batteries. Alkalines lasted a good week of the monitor being on quite often; these rechargeables last about 2 days on average. I discovered they are really only 7.2-volt batteries (hidden in the packaging) but they work with my monitor just fine. The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous! I guess they pay for themselves over time, and seem to be the best 9-volt rechargeable product that is out there, but it is almost a step backward from alkaline batteries."
4,Alien Planet Review,"It was a very fun and interesting concept and I did enjoy the movie, although if you are a parent purchasing it for a child under the age of 10 be advised it might be a little slow paced for them. And be prepared to answer plenty of questions! There is a fair amount of scientific info and narrative that younger kids don't find quite as interesting. That being said, I know my son still enjoyed it and I would recommend it to others who would like to encourage their child to find something different to entertain their brain! It's a wonderful opportunity to open an interesting dialogue with your child."
2,Mass fiction masquerading as science,"This program on Discovery was billed as future mission to explore life on another planet. That's all well and good, and for the first five minutes it was very interesting, with different scientists talking about how we would get there, how long it would take, how the ships and robots and other machinery would work. But after that it went downhill.There were mass assumptions made about what would be found and that may not be that bad, but then assumptions started being made based on previous assumptions and after 20 minutes what we had left science all together and was no better than an episode of Star Trek. What made it worse were the scientists commenting on different aspects of this fiction, such as the behaviour we're seeing from the animals found and such.Bottom line, lower your expectations when going to see this."
4,First time listener,"My first time hearing this band was this CD. I enjoyed it so much that I bought the album for myself, and ultimately other MOFRO albums. Great gritty, down south feel makes you feel like you're sitting on a porch in the Bayou."
3,somethin' different but some good mellow slow soul and blues,"Have to say that I heard about this band too not long ago while listening to streaming radio online. I immediately went online to find out more about them and I listened to some samples of this album and like the new bluesy soul sound they have. You normally don't expect something like that to come from Northern Florida but I was pleasantly surprised. Bottom line this good album sounds like a bluesy Van Morrison (ala ""Never get out of these blues alive"" style with John Lee Hooker) meets Robben Ford and The Blue Line with smooth electric guitars and soulful keyboards."
1,Product stopped working after 3 days of use.,This product was a simple install software and plug into the USB port. However after three days of use it started acting very sparatic. It was not only not getting connected but the indicator saying it was plugged into the USB port won't even light up now. This unit died in less then a week. We have tried it on 3 different PC's. It's not even heavy enough for a good paper weight now.
3,Not my favorite Graham Romance...,"First, let me say I am a huge Heather Graham fan (and all the romances by her pen name, Shannon Drake). I have rated many of her books 5 stars (see my other reviews). But I found this tale of two times and two loves difficult. It was distracting to move between a couple in Revolutionary War times to one in modern times. Just when I got into one romance, I was thrown into another. And I did not like the way the one in Revolutionary War times developed. You had to wait until modern times for a happy ending. So, this was not one of my favorites. And the whole reincarnation theme was also not one of my favorites either. Graham did a commendable job of telling the story, as she always does, but I just didn't think it was one of her best though perhaps not because of the writing but rather the story itself."
2,The mix just doesn't work,"After listening to this CD I have to say I was disappointed. Although there are certainly some beautiful selections, I found myself thinking most were a waste of his phenomenal voice. The highlight of the CD is the scrumptious ""Pearl Fishers"" duet. ""Shenandoah"", ""Gwenith Gwen"" and ""Danny Boy"" were sung as beautifully as I've ever heard. And he managed to raise ""Bella Notte"" from a children's song to an adult level. His much softer approach to ""Il Mio Cuore Va"" really did it for me. The rest, mostly old relgious melodies, just seemed to disappear in the face of the above. I truly expected a wonderful ""Ave Maria"" with Sissel, but have to say it fell short. The problem for me is not with the singer (who can argue his voice?) but with the mix of music. It is very difficult to listen to from beginning to end and I've never liked having to pick my way through a CD. Still, if you don't mind using the forward button a lot, it is worth having!"
5,Epic story...epic book,"Rising With The Son: A Diary Of A Growing SoulThere is a larger story. John's epic tale of our own story as told in the gospels in a valuable tool for a clear and revealing understanding of why life is so darn hard! Biblically sound and written with a heart for the Lord, this is a great give away book for people who have lost trust in the Lord or curious about the Christian walk.John's insight is clear and fresh and he delivers another home run with this short book. I recommend you go to his website and roll out the entire curriculum he offers in the DVD and workbooks! Go for it, and take your place in the battle."
4,Finally leaving depravity behind..,"While the confidence Eldredge displays in humankind will be hard for Calvinists to take, there is as much evidence for intrinsic goodness in humanity as intrinsic depravity. In short, the image of God was not lost in the fall, but only marred. And ""the true light enlightens every man coming into the world...""From this starting point it's much easier to follow Eldredge on his tour de force of popular culture. There truly is a hunger for God and for Spirit. There truly is a searching for something more.. a searching that is birthed by the Spirit who continues to hover over His creation.There is lots to like in this book, plenty of stimulation for the grey matter, and many touching points for both mind and heart. It's worth the read, even if you haven't yet escaped the distortions of Calvinist thinking."
4,Better than Wild at Heart,"Better, much better, than Wild at Heart, this short book draws on ancient and modern mythology, including lots of Lewis and Tolkien to illustrate the motifs of the drama of redemption. Heavy emphasis on free will, but otherwise excellent."
1,"little book, even less to say","I appreciate a simple message, simple & succinctly stated. But this ""book"" is a waste of even the short time it takes to read it, especially if you have already read Wild at Heart. Eldredge continues, but does not advance one iota, a central theme he stated in WAH: there is a great battle between good & evil, between God & Satan, a battle which started with Eden's fall, and we all play our part in it. I probably should have issued a spoiler alert, b/c I have now just told you everything that Eldredge has to say in Epic. Oh, you can enjoy his constant movie references, if you like, but even they are re-hashed: we get it, John, you like Braveheart and Gladiator and similar movies. But there is virtually no substance here, at least no substance that is not covered in WAH. I wish I could recommend this book more highly."
2,Well written story but style is not for everyone,"The reviews on Epic are overwhelmingly positive. The book does have a number of good points, and is written with much passion. It's quite short as well, but moves along quickly. The author makes a number of very interesting analogies, drawing from Tolkien, Braveheart and other books and movies. Eldredge definitely has a unique style. As such, it's quite likely you will either love this book or find it so hard to relate to that you can barely make it through despite the length (which was my reaction, nothing against the author). If you've liked other books by Eldredge such asWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soulyou'll probably like Epic. If you didn't like Wild at Heart, your opinion of the author won't change with Epic. If you haven't read anything by him, Epic is probably a great place to start."
2,Very depressing,Overall a very good cast with very good acting. But very dark and depressing. You feel bad for everyone. Even Jessica's stripper scenes cannot lift things up. Very heavy movie.
2,NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO,"After watching this movie, I wondered why I bought it. So, I went back to read the reviews. Most of them were really good. The rest were really bad. So, my curiosity was piqued--that's why I bought it. This film has such a really excellent cast. So many actors that I really like. And the quality of the acting, by everyone, was great. But, the content was TERRIBLE. I mean, really bad. Not as bad as Southland, but really bad, none the less. How did these magnificent actors align to work in such a bad, bad movie? One star is I hate it. Two stars for I don't like it. So because the acting was good, this product gets 2 stars. But wow, really bad. Maybe seeing JESSICA BEIL POLE DANCING AND TOPLESS (not unimpressive on both counts, admittedly) is what drives these many positive reviews. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY LACKING."
5,Tying It Altogehter,"Jessia Biel portrays a strong performance as a single mother working as a nightclub dancer in search of a meaningful relationship. In what maybe Patrick Swayze last role, as a ruthless strip club owner, plots meet here into chance meetings. This plays well with Ray Liotta's ex-con persona an unknown father hiding a fortune in stolen cash. Into the story is thrown Forest Whitaker a defrocked priest finding his own salvation and gay identity. There is no doubt that Jessica Biel pulls this movie from mediocre to compelling, however, by end Ray Liotta's character ties it altogether."
3,Very cute,Music and animation working so far. Will continue to use for at least an hour a day to see if it continues to do so. Purchased 7 of Mr. Christmas products this year for home use. Had to return 3 for failing to continue to do so. Luckily all of them failed within the return grace period. Mr. Christmas should consider making a better product and lower prices due to poor quality.
5,Nice,"This is a nice CD. It is the same as you see on Nick TV-3 10 min. or so shows, but worth the money if you unable to watch at the times that it is on."
4,A Little different from the movies we normally view...,This was a very interesting movie. If you like 'em a little out of the norm - you will like this one.
4,I love this movie!!!,This movie is very romantic and sweet. It is very entertaining and has a lot of cute lines thrown in that make you think. I am going to buy this movie and probably watch it all the time. There must have been some attraction between the fairy and leprechaun in real life b/c their chemistry on screen is so sincere and beautiful!! This movie is kind of long but it is worth it!! It's wonderful!!!
2,Extreamly long but funny,"This would have been a great movie to watch as a family near St. Patricks Day, (thats what I was hoping) but it turned out to be very long and dragged on. The movie was cute, and funny in a lot of parts but it left my family wondering if the movie was ever going to end."
1,I don't understand,"I honestly don't understand these reviews. I bought this DVD because of a link to the 10th Kingdom. I tried to watch it several times, but could not even get through it once. It is terrible. What were these other reviewers watching?"
5,Best Movie Ever!!!!,"I believe strongly that everyone should have this movie in their home video library. This movie has adventure, mystery, intrigue, suspense, romance, comedy and an excellent story. Children, teenagers and grown adults will love this movie! There's so much beauty to this film as well. The scenery is amazing and magical in itself! I can watch is again and again and never get board of it."
3,Gobbet game,I felt the box and the game looked very used for what I paid for it. The game itself is educational.Thank you.
4,I like the book. My Spanish teacher hates it.,"This is one of my favorite book. I took it to Ecuador and showed it to my Spanish teacher. She was mortified and couldn't believe what she was reading. She said that many of the expressions / phrases used in the book make no sense to her as an Ecuatoriana. Other expressions / phrases are used only by ""jovenes."" It simply doesn't sound right when an adult says them. She also pointed out that out-of-context, some of the expressions / phrases can easily be misinterpreted to something totally different and possibly insulting.Nevertheless, I still enjoy reading the book. I just have to keep in mind to be careful what expressions / phrases that I use."
2,Good for elementary learners,"There is nothing in this book that an intermediate or higher student doesn't already know. If your new to Japanese, go for it otherwise don't waste your money."
1,hmm...,"I understand that this book was only a dollar, thus the space to have negative feelings is rather limited, but with that said, I would not recommend this version for you to buy.It seems as though the 'publisher' of this kindle book simply took a pdf or something and converted it into the kindle format, so most of the pages just look confusing because titles or page numbers that would typically go at the top of a page in a book are scattered randomly throughout the page as you read, which can really throw you off reading. Also, it does not have a table of contents, so if you really want to read it, you have to start from the beginning and hope you don't need to skip around.Im sorry to put a negative review, but I figured I would let everyone know what they were buying."
5,decadentes al rescate,"Decadents to the rescue:\ In a musical world full of chart topping corporate hits... this album presents a very fresh aproach to popular latin music ... repeating themselves from previous hits Trans noche delivers just what this band is about, Fun music that the common average person in latin america identifies with... the belnding of caribbean tropical,cumbia, merengue and contemporary rock rythims makes thhis a very good selection for the person that is looking for a fun and great musical experience."
4,Muy bueno,"Es un gran album musicalmente es el mas avanzado de todos , aunque no el preferido de la mayoria , los temas para destecar son: yo puedo siendo el unico tema de ska en todo el album con una letra "" espiritual"" y toques de punk , soñaba con aires de cumbia y algo de reggae con un corte muy bonito de jazz , en las fiestas un simple pero brillate villancico de punk rock , te contaron un exelente tema que mezcla varios ritmos latinos , el ultimo track diamente una balada que cuenta la historia del hombre que no siente , que no ama , que no sufre ... a base de piano y voz y enamorada un exelente cuarteto. lo que le fato al disco es mas ska , rocksteady o reggae."
5,Nice to remember,Ver y good to hear an old friend again. Baby Come Back brings lots of memories back.
4,Interesting read,"I enjoyed this book about the iditarod and mushing, something I didn't know much about before. I found the book informative and interesting. It wasn't as humorous as I thought it might be (no laugh out loud moments), and the format was a bit confusing - the author flips back and forth to other mushers and other time periods - but it was a quick read and I learned a little about something new (for me). I also know that while I'll stay off the iditarod trail, I might check the race out online this year. It's an interesting sport, for a very special type of person."
4,And I thought rock climbers were a bit off the scale.....,"A dynamite read even for someone who has never lived north of Key West, who has never even heard of the Iditarod, and who hates dogs. Adds credence to the fact that I never read fiction..life is a lot stranger, and a lot more exciting"
4,Whole new prespective,I was given this book as a birthday present and it was one of the best gifts ever. The trials and tribulations that these athletes (dogs and man) go through for very little glory relative to professional sports was awe-inspiring. I did get lost in the names of the other mushers and so of the dogs. So confused that I wrote the names on the inside back cover to keep things straight.A good book to give people an overview and insight into a grueling human and dog feat.
1,He wasn't ready,"The raves over this concert prove that if you have a loyal following, you can lead the deaf and blind.One of the biggest concerts of his career, and the man didn't prepare.Go back and review the 1969 special and come back to this one.In five years time, he aged 15 years, his voice has tragically failed.He showed up here bloated, barely able to move, busting out of his clothes, throat full of mucus. god knows what he ate before this show. His mind was more on the off-the-record remarks he made during the station breaks about the Austrailans and the press.Challenging passages he would normally glide through became croaks.From one of his life-long fans, this simply will not do. Should have prepared better. You can fool some of the people some of the time,.........Lesson: god given talent not a given forever if one does not look after oneself"
1,Appalling and sad....,"Sinatra, in his prime, was the greatest pop singer who ever lived. Unfortunately, this concert video illustrates Frank's decline all too vividly. His once-magnificent, ""well-seasoned cello"" of a voice simply sounds awful, and he looks like an over-the-hill saloon singer going through the motions. To add insult to injury, you have to listen to the execrable Howard Cosell bloviate for the first 10 minutes or so. Definitely NOT recommended. You want to discover Frank's greatness? Shut the idiot box off and listen to Sinatra Sings For Only the Lonely. Preferably on a dark, solitary night. His voice will make you weep."
3,The key word here is ENERGY,"Frank definitely looks and sounds as if he has been doing alot of boozing and staying out late on this performance. What he lacks in vocal power in this performance, he makes up for in charisma and confidence. He cuts notes short, knowing his limitations. The highlight for me was his performance of Angel Eyes. His voice was perfect for the message in this song. As always Frank was classy and professional. I would recommend this more for the attitude and swagger that was Frank, than for his vocal capabilities during this particular performance."
1,Poorly made!,The red folding goal posts do not fit together properly (the joint button doesn't match up with the hole it goes into). The goal posts don't stay connected and the goal doesn't sit level on the ground. Franklin Sports is unable/unwilling to replace parts.Franklin NHL Set of 2 Mini Hockey Goals
5,Can't beat it for the price,"This is an awesome knee hockey set. Everything is preassembled and ready to use out of the box. Nets snap in place in seconds and are equally quick to break down again. This set also has two left handed sticks and two right handed sticks, many sets only have right handed sticks.It also came with a handy bag to store everything in which is a plus. I would recommend buying some extra knee hockey pucks and/or balls to go with this set because 4 just isn't enough if you're firing shot after shot.I'm very satisfied with this set and would buy it again in a heart beat."
1,picture shows contents,"Click on the picture and it will show a close up of the cover, which lists the videos on it"
5,Great Drywall Tool,This is a great drywall tool for cutting off the tapered edge of a piece of drywall. This is the second one I have purchased.
4,One FUN Englishman,"I've read and enjoyed almost every Kingsley Amis book. The main character in this one is not likable so I suppose a lot of people will be turned off and go back to watching The Bachelor or MSNBC, or some other sewage, and in so doing they'll miss out on gems like this:Then he went down the slope to join her. He slid about a bit in doing so, either because of the gin or because he was holding his stomach in so tightly that his legs worked like stilts or because the grass was slippery."
2,How the World is Governed,"I love the idea of this book, it's organization, and the wealth of information it presents. However, every page is chock full. There is next to no white space. A sizable part of every page is presented in what seems to be 2- or maybe even 1-point type. I've tried it without my glasses, with my glasses, and even with a magnifying glass. It's too much trouble. If I and my eyes were 30 or 40 years younger, I'd get a whole lot more out of it."
4,Almost perfect,"The Antec P180 has several innovations which make it almost perfect for a new computer build. First, I like the power supply at the bottom of the case. Whatever noise is generated by my power supply goes straight into the carpet, and the machine isn't as top-heavy as a case with the normal power supply location. Installation of hard drives and 5.25 drives is extremely easy with the clip system Antec has used for several generations, and this version is even easier than before. Now the big drives go in from the front, meaning you don't have to squeeze new components past your CPU and memory. The front panel components are high quality. I like the ability to connect so many devices without having to reach behind the computer. Finally, the size is just right - roomy without being too big.The only negative is the open fan vent on top. It lets out noise that I don't want to hear, and it should come with a sticker that says ""Pour coke here""."
2,This is a poor dvd. Do Not Buy.,"Incomplete information and shows poor form. Has bad advice. Buy - Olympic Weightlifting: A DVD Guide to Learning & Teaching The Olympic Lifts, by Greg Everett (2011). I bought both, the Everett DVD is vastly superior in every way."
3,Good book.. But I have better.,"This book does a good job getting you started and is good for a reference, but I think it focuses way to much on GLUT. Personally I don't like or use GLUT, so maybe I'm biased. If you're on a Win32 platform.. Get the OpenGL SuperBible. It's even better than this one."
2,"Not a bad book, but not what I expected either!","I don't want to bash this book or its publisher, but someone needs to make some changes. I also made the mistake of thinking this book was the book from the PBS show Kid Concoctions as did my sister. I'm sure many others are doing the same. This book is not bad, the problem is that it is very upsetting feeling that you were tricked into buying a knock off. Even if it isn't a knock off, that is the perception many of us have. Not to mention the fact that my kids could not make any of the project they saw on TV with this book. I suggest the publisher change the name to someting more original. Just my thoughts."
4,Cosmo Makeover Yourself!,"This game is okay if you like to play around with looks. It'd be better if you had more makeup choices, or other brands. The hairstyle choices are wide ranged but some hairstyles are hideous! If you are buying this game to make-over yourself be sure to have a digital camera of some sort or it won't be much fun. The other versions of the game are pretty good to as well because you can do more, but this game sells pretty cheap so if you are looking for a simple makeover then try out this orginal makeover game!"
2,Nice Christmas (1998) Gift,"The major part of this book is made up of two page wide, single line entries for each fund. Entries consist of the usual stats available for free on-line. It would be worth the price to have this information neatly bound in a book - if the data was current, but it isn't. November 1998 mutual fund data is not much use in November 2001 (will this bull market ever end?). No fault of the authors - but not a good buy now."
5,Time to revisit nuclear power,"Corporate propaganda? Only if you are so closed minded you won't accept truth and logic.Stewart Brand (the Whole Earth Catalog) and Patrick Moore (Greenpeace founder) have both come to the conclusion that nuclear energy has a significant role to play in the future energy mix.This book clearly and fairhandedly addresses the objections and myths about nuclear energy. Dr. Waltar does not hide or downplay issues or problems, including Three Mile Island or Chernobyl, but he explains them without the hysteria exhibited by the popular media.Am I biased in favor of nuclear power? Sure I am. But for good reason. This book explains those reasons."
5,"HomeCinema, here we come","Aside from the fact that you have dolby surround in your home, this amazing product enables you a whole new world of gaming, DVD watching, and music listening. I had some doubts regarding the power of this speaker system, but It is more then great. It gives you the feeling of home cinema! The only bad thing is that you will need a newer sound card to use it, but those are given with every newer configuration lately. 5 stars well earned!"
3,The author of the book: a study in egomania.,"Sadly, Bazzana comes across as an armchair intellectual whose own insecurities stunt the potential of this book."
2,Disappointing,"This book had a lot of promise.. I was very interested in learning more about the world of Electronic Commerce and how local and global economies are being impacted. This book made a few interesting points, but for the most part was tedious to read, and never got into enough detail on any one subject to be interesting.I'm still looking for another e-commerce roadmap..."
1,Vague babble,"This was a real disappointment. The book is almost unreadable. Terms are defined and then not used properly or are jumbled together--you never can tell what she's talking about. Too many vague generalities. Sentences often make no sense. This book desperately needs an editor. I don't think the author has anything interesting to say about ""virtual money,"" but it's hard to tell. A confusing jumble of babble. Click on to the next book."
4,"Miles Davis ""Miles Ahead""","I had heard the album several times before, and I enjoyed it very much. It helped me build an appreciation for jazz. I was convinced with Miles' style of music. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys jazz; whether it be Miles Davis or anyone else. It's great!"
3,Nice Arrangements,"Some very pleasing tones on this Miles Ahead release. After three or four listens, some moments stand out more than others. New Rhumba seems to stick in my ear the most.The overall sound has a more orchestral tone with more focus than later releases. No song exceeds six minutes in length and the jams do not go off the deep end. That may be good or bad depending upon your tastes. For me the experience just may need a little getting used to. But no doubt about it, Miles sure was a talent."
1,This book is alright.........,"I ordered this book since it was for one of my classes and i was very disappointed with what i received. Grant it, it was page for page exactly the book that i ordered, but when i recieved it, it had this black border that said ""free book, not for resale"" all over it!! Like written in white all along this black border. BUT for some reason, it's NOT in the picture and that's just not right. Plus, it's not like i can sell it anywhere, i mean it says ""dont sell"" all over it. If i would've known that was what i was getting, then i probably would've just gone to the bookstore and spent a little more to get a regular one that i'd be able to sell back. But if it makes any difference at all, i got it on time. This is like one of the only disappointments i've ever gotten from amazon."
2,Misleading title header,"The heading is very tricky. It makes you think that it comes with an access code for the mysoclab series. Had I known, I wouldn't have purchased this because it comes out more expensive than the one that's sold at our school. I was gonna return it but I didn't want to go through all the trouble of doing so, so I had to buy the access code online which is $50! I ended up spending more than $120 instead of getting it from the school for $80 WITH the access code included in it! Very disappointing.."
3,Easy reading,"I enjoyed the historical pointers and the scientific knowledge of that time. It was the best part. I didn't enjoyed the part of the sisters that seemed to just understand and liked ""the book"" eventhough they had no knowledge. I would have expect curiosity and at least one of them would have had a different reaction. It wasn't even remotly credible.So, to conclude; It had a potential for a great book instead of a good one. Maybe the writer was not well guided by her editors."
3,mediocre,"I enjoyed the historical and scientific research in this story, I also liked Ford, but I felt that Violet was a drip. Also, the overuse of the expression ""Faith"" (20 + times), and the constant intermingling of period and modern (slang) language really annoyed and distracted me, and prevented me from enjoying the story. I've never read any other of Lauren Royal's books, so I'm not sure I would continue with this author. I feel it odd that her research did not include the language of the time."
2,Not one of Jerry's best,"Having read ""Cruel Doubt"" and being an avid fan of Jerry's books, I ordered this book from America as it is unavailable in Australia. It took six weeks to arrive, and when I read it, I was disappointed, as the boring, repetitive narrative is extremely irritating, and unlike his other stories, in this book, Jerry's writing style is poor and he fails (for the first time in his true crime writing career) to draw the reader into the story. I am still a loyal fan of Jerry's, but I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about the Von Stein case to skip this book and instead purchase ""Cruel Doubt"" by Joe McGinniss, which is far superior in its portrayal of the facts."
1,Never Again,"They (all three units I bought) leak.The wick is only 1/2"" wideI was going to hand them in my barn, but they're not worth it. Too much trouble to send back, but I'll never use them.My own fault for not buying at the local Tractor Supply Store."
5,there is light,This is a great little lantern well made for the price we love them use them for outside yard party lights
1,be careful,"I bought this program because I was desperate to syncronize my Palm Pilot IIIx with Outlook 2000. All I had from the beginning were problems and error messages. After calling the company and talking to two different representatives for two hours total, I didn't resolve anything and I consider myself a fairly knowledgeable computer user. I have never had as many problems trying to configure software on my desktop.I suggest that before you buy Desktop to Go make sure that you are ready to take advantage of the 30 day money-back guarantee. I had never had as many problems with a Dataviz product and I was disappointed with this product. The techs told me that there were probably other software conflicts but nothing was resolved beyond that."
4,fun vocal house cd1/ ok trance cd2,"I bought this album on a whim and I am glad I did. The first cd is a unique mix of vocal house that makes you want to sing along. I usually skip straight to track 6 or 7 on the second disk. I personaly like that up beat West Hollywood type of sound and hey, this does it for me."
4,A Beautiful Mind,"This relatively short Star Trek novel by a veteran writer concerns itself with a less-than-perfect first contact with a new humanoid species. In it, Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol has to come to terms with her training in the pacifist tradition all Vulcan's learn at an early age, and how to reconcile this with the reality of everyday circumstances. This concept was developed very well by the author J.M. Dillard, furthering the understanding of Vulcan's and their way of thought. In addition, part of this novel is devoted to how some other crew members feel towards T'Pol, considering her as ""incredibly intelligent, courteous, refined, dignified"", adding to her lure. This book is well worth reading, done in fine Star Trek style."
5,The protein folding problem best source!,"This book is extremely informative, well-writen and clear on explaining the 3D structural biology of life, Monte carlo and mol dynamics methods on how to simulate its conformational space and limitations of this area of research. An exciting new book in a very exciting field."
2,"Lots of stuff to read, less to understand","The book is quite long and seems informative, however I did not get what I wanted. It should be a modeling and simulation book, but it has so little info about forcefields in molecular dynamics for example...I would suggest buying the books by Andrew Leach or Frenkel and Smit."
4,The hit this Christmas!,"Originally this was purchased for my oldest son. However, all my kids love chess as well as ourselves. I knew I had no chance of ever being able to get to use it if it was given exclusively to my son. So we gifted it as a family gift. We all have enjoyed it immensely."
2,I love bad movies but not like this,"I was really excited to get this set expecting lots of zany moonshine laiden countrified 70s sleeze and violence, but have got not, aside from 2000 maniacs <the only watchable film in this set> its all boring diolauge drival that goes nowhere for hours on end, with an ocational jonnie cash wanna be poping up in every movie singing theame songs. I knew I was in trouble when the general audiance rating poped up on the first movie I watched <swamp girl>, seems to be lots of edits in these flicks, and the only reason people would want this is for the sleeze factor, makes no sence. Sure there are extras but watching the cutouts for movies that are unwatchable isnt much, I would try to find 2000 maniacs on another set, theres nothing eles here."
1,I love it... but...,"I LOVE THE MUSIC SO MUCH!but...IT'S IN THE WORST FREAKING SHAPE! The cd case literally fell apart in my hands! they said it was like brand new... But the plastic is scratched, and the cover was not attached! The plastic connecting the cover and the case was not even present in the box, so they were well aware of the condition.I LOVE THE MUSIC!So I will keep it. But I won't be buying from these dopes ever again!"
2,Major Disapointment,"Middlefinger's first two albums were some of my favorite to listen to, so I wonder how did this album end up being so bad? The problem with Digitus Impudicus is not that Middlefinger totally changed their style, but that they played their style with less distinction and originality than on their previous two albums. The songs on Digitus Impudicus lack the creative flow and blend of styles that made Middlefinger the best local band in Houston. Many songs on this labum start to sound the same as every other song on this album, which is totally opposite of Middlefinger's previous albums. Buy this album if you're a Middlefinger fanatic, but don't be suprised if you're disapointed with Digitus Impudicus."
5,Extraordinary!,"The ultimate voyeur's journey into the lives of soul mates Griffin and Sabine. The reader follows the courtship of Griffin, a postcard designer in Great Britain and Sabine, a stamp artist in the South Pacific through their correspondence of letters and postcards. While reading this book I got the same feeling I had while sneaking peaks at my Aunt's ribbon wrapped love letters in the 1950's. This is an artsy, mystery, romance all rolled into one. A fun and unique read!......bg"
5,Griffin & Sabine: An Extraordinary Correspondence,"An epistolary novel in which Griffin Moss, a postcard artist in London, and Sabine Strohem, a postage stamp illustrator in the South Seas, fall in love via the mail, never having seen or spoken to each other. The book is illustrated in varying styles, from detailed line drawings to collages."
5,From unknown correspondences becoming life long friends...,"Like the previous review, I became intranced with the journey of Sabine and Griffin, by receiving books one a two as gifts from a man I will never meet. Across the miles, and through our extraordinary communications, we have touched each other's hearts. We have lasted 5 years of correspondence. May those who are fortunate to land upon this unique writing enjoy it as much as I have, and I thank my friend, for always being a gentleman and the introduction to this series.Come take a journey of heartfelt pleasures, that only through writing will allow your mind to travel as you begin Griffin and Sabine... with each envelope you open you feel like you are swept into a private world, all your own."
2,Felt it was a waste,"I make pies each week for the restaurant in a little town where I live. This book was one I hoped would help me bump up my game. sadly it had nothing special to offer, I have not used one recipe from this book. I have used many from ""Mrs. Rowe's book of southern pies"". Look for it, you won't be disappointed"
2,Disappointed!,"I was expecting more! It is a very small recipe book, and frankly, I did not think it was worth the money."
2,Too journalistic,"Robert Atwan is an absolutely marvelous editor of this series. But the guest editors, lately, are not literary enough--or rather their choices aren't. When you reread essays selected by Elizabeth Hardwick ('86) or Cynthia Ozick ('98), they hold up beautifully. I'm not sure Orlean's pieces are as timeless. It must be hard, after all these years, to keep finding distinguished new guest editors, so I certainly can't blame Atwan for turning to glossy article writers."
3,weakest one yet,"I read this series every year, and usually love it, but this edition is rather weak, and I'm surprised, I like and respect Susan Orlean's work, and I would have thought that she would pick better essays. Alas, it isn't so. There are no essays that are truly, truly exceptional. Some are quite good, like Franzen (no surprise there), Kitty Burns Florey, Danielle Ofri (again no surprise), and Shine. Most fall in the blah category. You could take them or leave them. They aren't bad, but they aren't all that good, and definitely should be in this volume. And then there are the clunkers, more than I'm used to seeing in this series (Angell, Barrett, Hoagland, Levy, Masello, States, Ullman, Wallace, and Welker)."
1,THE WORST GUIDE EVER!,"I hated this guide. It is misleading, the maps stink even though the 3-D looks cool. I had to buy another guide. The only good part about this guide was the appendixes. But this guide frustrated and confused me so much I thought this game was impossible to beat! DO NOT BUY THIS GUIDE!"
4,Poster,"I purchased this guide mainly for the poster. For the guide, I would say it is overall ok for leading you through the game. The maps are decent but a little confusing...overall the guide doesn't seem well thought out. Like the producers of the guide didn't sit down and actually think about how to convey the needed information in a great way, they just chose a simple way to do it, and this method had its trade-offs. Trust the other reviews for the actual guide, I put photos of the guide onto the site. The poster is also very nice and I recommend you get a guide with the poster."
3,You Have To Laugh,"After reading other reviews of St Agatha's Breast, I realize I've been taking this book too literally. On the surface, it's about a morally bankrupt monastery full of thieves, perverts, murderers, and grotesques -- on the whole, a very unsavory lot. However, if you look at it as absurdist, then I suppose it makes for an entertaining read. I confess (no pun intended) that the frequent references to pedophilia corroborates my suspicion that the practice and acceptance of same was not a deep, dark secret, that many, many people and clergy have known from time immemorial that children have been abused by priests. T.C. Adler is a pseudonym who, according to the book jacket, is ""very experienced in both the worlds of art and the Church."" Why the anonymity? Sorry, but had I not picked up a more wholesome novel while reading this one, I would have finished it."
3,Part of a larger picture,"There are those who can say Norton has written a sub-par book with this effort, but they would be wrong to place the blame on him. While this book suffers in the areas of plot movement and difference in materal, it most likey tells the truth, however dim that is. With few to no happy endings to be found here, Norton is simply speaking for a group of people for whom things don't always work out: the young and confused. Perhaps not the great American novel of its time, but it still has its place."
5,Worth the c-note,"The illustrations alone make this a worthwhile buy, whether you're a gastroenterologist or just extremely interested in colonoscopies. Ever since Katie Couric's live colonoscopy on TODAY, I've been intrigued by the procedure, considering it something of an art form as well as an intrusive medical procedure. But Abraham Dachman and his team of writers make a compelling argument for the use of Virtual Colonoscopy in lieu of long tubes, nano-cameras, and liquid barium. It's a brave new world."
2,read more like a sampling of anecdotes than a literary masterpiece,I enjoyed the throwaway tidbits about life in Flushing Queens and adopting babies in Nahtzee-infested Paraguay (I had NO IDEA!) but I bought this book because the blurb promised an incisive look at Upper West Side culture and that was not the case at all. This book was kind of nothing so why would there be so much hype about it.
2,Dissappointing..,"After a long time I read a book by an Indian author and it was really disappointing. Initially, the characters are not described well, there are too many of them, and it seems like it's all over the place. There is no constant train of thought and it's very confusing to follow the book in the beginning.The book is about a girl, who travels to America after the death of her husband and meets people while she lives in America. Its does not show the true picture of ones struggles and suffering - she seems to meet someone all the time that is willing to take care of her and help her. I think the author was not able to get the message across to the readers, if there ever was one. I would not recommend this book."
5,Innovative and creative music.,This is a very unusuall reggae album as it sticks with the reggae most of the way through and you can hear elements of all sorts of genres flying about. If you're a fan of reggae music then you will love this album but strictly speaking it can appeal to anybody. The first time i heard King Django was on a hellcat compilation that was'nt too good and it was one of the only tracks that stood out. I was suprised when i bought this album as it makes you think about other cultures and countrys different to us and the over all feel from the album is like listning to the music while at the beach so it's a good album especially for those with an over active imagination. I also like the inclusion of the various instruments throughout the album. It's a great album that i was lucky to come upon and i strongly recommend anything by king django to date.
3,Companion Movie to a Good Book,"I recently read ""The Last Stand of Fox Company"" about a significant battle in the Korean War. I was very impressed with the book and the difficult elements that the soldiers had to put up with. When I saw that ""Fixed Bayonets"" was on TV recently, I made a point to watch it. The circumstances of the film were very similar to those of the book and I appreciated the way I was able to compare my mental images with the visual ones in ""Fixed Bayonets"". In the process of supplementing a good book, I rediscovered a good movie. The focus of the film was the challenge of one man to overcome his weaknesses in an unforgiving environment. This isn't a great film but it is certainly worth watching. For those that don't know much about the Korean War, this is a good place to start learning."
4,Good war film,Low budget war film with great script and performances. A classic film well worth watching.
3,This album is just okay,"I was initially excited about this album, and liked the first few singles. There are some nice beats and great tracks here, but the album is essentially incomplete. The skits take away from the album, as do some of the more silly and/or misogynist lyrics. I'd say about four of the tracks are worth keeping."
4,Good not great,"This CD is incomplete i think. It has a few catchy songs to gain the publics acceptance (Ill B Dat, Do Goodness, Well allRight Chall), and after listening to the CD all the way through, the beats, although not great, get you hooked. It is a CD to sit back and chill to in the backgroud. The skits should be minimal or taken out completely though."
2,NOT fairly written,"If your an Al Gore fan, you probably won't be able to finish this book. While its historic component is detailed and its research seems thorough (hence, two stars), its written in a completely biased style. The title itself suggests that Al Gore is merely a man that's calculated to the point of having no sincerity; he's invented his persona, he hasn't 'earned' it, according to the author. This book is not non-fiction in its writing style. It makes presumptions that lead the reader to believe that the author knows what Al Gore was actually thinking at the time. Do not read, certainly, don't buy it."
3,funny but fun,"Okay some of it is corny, but this is better than those annoying gamera flicks. most of it is stock footage from past godzilla movies with the exception of godzilla and son taking on what looks like a reptilian version of king kong called gabra. Corny in a good way. liked it better when i was younger though. this would be funny if it appeared on mst 3000!!"
2,"Oh man, what a waste of a good Godzilla title!!!","Godzilla's Revenge, what comes to mind when you think of that. I thought Godzilla becomes evil and devastates Tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie. This is all in a boy's dream...what the heck? Now I enjoy Godzilla movies,I even liked Son of Godzilla but this movie is a disgrace. Why would Minilla be Barney and talk? What's with this bully nonsense? I wanted rubber monsters action, the only good point of this movie is Godzilla verses Gabara that's the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage."
1,"Annoying, disturbing, ridiculous...but it's not cancer!","When it comes right down to it, if you like Godzilla movies, you'll probably like this one. If you think Godzilla is cheesy then bring some crackers, 'cause this one is full of fromage! The entire movie (plot, characters, music) is extremely annoying! My 4-year old loves it though. My main critique (besides the obvious) is that there are some disturbing scenes when the bank robber chases the little boy with a knife. Not that kids nowawdays don't see a lot worse on cereal commercials. If you can find a cheap copy somewhere, it's worth a laugh."
5,What did we do to deserve Godzilla's Revenge?!,"Although the title to this -um- movie is pretty cool, the movie falls about 20 light years short of living up to it's name. With the actors that made the other Godzilla actors look like Acadamy Award winners and monster scenes from other movies horribly edited in, this waste of film looks more like ""Godzilla meets the Power Rangers"". It's a wonder that after the wrath of ""the big guy"" there were any more Godzilla's made."
1,"This movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad bad!!!","This movie is made of nothing but crap! I though this movie was about Godzilla getting revenge on Japan. This movie is a ripoff. So don`t buy it! Minya looks horrible too. Instead of looking like a mutant dinosaur, Minya looks like the pillsbury doughboy!!! The special effects are lame!!! If you are given this movie by someone who knows nothing about Godzilla, trade it with someone who has better Godzilla movies like Godzilla 2000. If you can`t, avoid it by watching better Godzilla movies, play sports, go ice skating, play video games, etc. I don`t care what you do to avoid it!!! Just don`t buy it, rent it, or even watch it for 2 seconds. Trust me, ths movie sucks!"
5,Great protection,We've had a similar one for years and never could find them to use on our other doors. These worked great and the price is right.
3,master lock 265D security bar,This arrived quickly and in great shape. It was recommended by a friend and I found it easy to adjust and it holds the door somewhat securely. You have to get the angle just right to make it work but it does a fair job.If you are wanting additional security then this should do the trick.
1,I wouldn't do it....,I bought this for my girlfriend for a little extra security while I'm out of town. She had problems getting the adjustable foot to grip the wood floor. So i tried and was able to get it to work. Then she said push on the door and see if it works. I gently pushed and the door didn't move. Then i threw my shoulder into it 2 times and the plastic yoke shattered and went flying across the room. I only weigh 170lbs! Needless to say...we decided on a German Shepard instead.
3,Security Bar Falls Short,"Although it props the front door with sufficient strength as to give me more time to prepare in the event of a forced break in, as rare an occaision as that may be, it falls short as far as the billed dual function goes. The dual function of this device was to also be extensible enough to use on your sliding patio door. I guess I've got larger than standard sliding doors because it fell about 1"" short of the handle. Quite disappointing that's why I won't buy a second one."
1,Make Sure you Order From Amazon and NOT Taylor Security,"I have bought this security bar from Amazon in the past. Master Lock security bar works very well.This time I ordered one for my mother, Alena, but did not notice it was coming from Taylor Security?When I got the box it was damaged and product too. When I went to return the process was slow.IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM MAKE SURE YOU ORDER FROM AMAZON AND NOT TYALOR SERCURITY, who ever they are?"
2,Wrong Item,"I was surprised that this security bar was limited in the size. I have a doggie door in the patio frame, so my patio glass door does not close to the full length of the door frame. The security bar would not become small enough.The product was very well made and felt very strong. I would have been very happy with it but for the doggie door."
5,It keeps the kid in!,"This product does what it says it will do. It's a no-muss, easy install, and it definitely keeps the door closed and keeps my preschooler (who can unlock our patio door) IN. It's also easy to pull out when we need to use the door.EDIT: The plastic foot on this stopper broke recently when it fell out of the patio door (I assume). Seems like it should be able to hold up better than that, but it's probably glueable and still a good product."
4,Sturdy!,"This device is very sturdy. I went outside and my wife put it against the door. When I tried to get in, the door did not budge at all!It's easy to use and my order arrived within days. Excellent product for the price."
2,Good product.....but,I thought this was a good product but it arrived with a part missing so I had to return it. The best part of this whole experience was the return process. It actually worked the way the company said it would and my money was refunded promptly. Kudos to Amazon!!!!!I work in a field that deals with consumer issues with various internet companies and I must say that Amazon is a standout. I would not hesistate to order from them in the future based on this experience.
2,Could be a good product ...... but....,"At first this item seemed very sturdy and ideal. However after only a week's use, the black plastic ring that the inner tube rides in came out of the larger tube. This allowed the upper tube to cant over on an angle, and as a result the small pin (used to adjust the height) would barely hold on in the adjustment hole, and often would actually not hold. This renders the product useless as sold.I had to figure out what height I wanted to set the bar at, then drill a hole completely through and install a bolt and nut. It works now but.... no more adjustability. Small changes in the manufacture of this item would create a GREAT product. Unsatisfactory as is though."
5,Just as described,"The Master Lock is just as described and is very easy to use. No tools necessary, I just took it out of the box set it up for my front door."
4,2 flaws.... 1 minor 1 possibly major,I bought this at the store and even though it serves it's purpose I found that it slightly slides on the carpet so I added Velcro strips not the fabric part for the carpet plays as that and it now locks into place..The second flaw hasn't been tested yet but I noticed the ball that holds the foot/base on might snap depending on the amount of force but that's not been tested and lets hope we don't have too.Yet over all it gives that added peace of mind.I gave it 4 stars based on these issues and because it sits a bit lose under the door nob. Even pressing it tight it seems to slip off the rim of the ring and grabs the neck of the knob...
2,Not solid!,"At first I liked the item, it looked good but after 2 times of use, I tried to lock the door with it and suddenly something inside it just fell apart and the lock just stopped functioning. I do not recommend it!"
4,Like these.,I bought these for every door in my home! Love them. The only problem I had with them. I dropped one & the black plastic part at the top snapped off! still like them because I think someone trying to get in would make alot ofnoise trying to kick in a door with one. of these on it
4,Works well,It basically works as advertised. It is easy to use and fits all of my door. It seems sturdy enough. You just have to make sure to push it firmly under the door knob and then the door is secure.
4,Overall good peace o fmind.,"The device does what is suppose to. If someone wanted to break in the front door of our apartment they would have to kick it down... and we would actually hear it.We were more afraid of someone ""sneaking"" in the place, rather than breaking in.When it is stretched out to the fullest it seems a little flimsy.An Added bonus is that it also works as a door stopper to hold the front door open."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,I was excited to purchase this for my daughter for Christmas and read a lot of the reviews on Gold Label music boxes. The reviews were pretty average over all but I decided to take my chances. Big mistake! This item arrived tonight and before wrapping it up I wanted to make sure it was working (tip I took from other reviewers). I am glad I did as one string of the carousel lights did not light up and there is no way to fix this yourself. Also for $113 this was very poorly made. The entire music box is cheap plastic and some of the plastic on the top of the box was deeply gouged and scratched. Sadly this is being returned ASAP and I am once again on the hunt for a quality music box that my daughter can enjoy for years.
3,disappointment from the start,I actually ended up giving it away because you must have he game disc in at all times when you play the game. You cannot put it on the computer and play when you want and where you want easily. Otherwise it was fun.
5,Great CD. Classic Branford Marsalis,"I really enjoy this CD. Branford is one with his horn and this cd really demonstrates it. He explores a variety of sounds and is backed up by an awesome crew including Kenny Kirkland, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock and Buster Williams. If you like jazz, I definitely recommend this CD. Close your eyes and you'll think you are sitting at the corner table at the back of a narrow little bar listening to these guys get lost in their music."
4,Earphones are NOT included!,"Until the product description is corrected, be aware that the earphone offer is not valid from this seller."
5,Brilliant Movie (so many ways of putting it!!!),"This movie is a brilliant collection item for Sonic fans escpecially on DVD, great animation, great story and great action, it really captures the fast-paced manuvers of Sonic and the other characters. Theres only one thing i could find which sort of let the movie down, and that was that it was too short, 60 minutes really isn't enough, you need double the time for a really great movie, I just hope they make the next one longer (if there is a next one). There's nothing else i can say exept that it's a must see movie..."
3,Sonic Movie has great attention of videos and DVDs,"Well, you don't know where my Sonic Hedgehog movie is on NTSC Video, but it came since 20th June 2003 - it got broken since 6th June 2004.But now, I had this on Region 2 DVD (from England).(...)"
5,Best M0vie EVER!,"Yes, im just a normal 9 year old who loves Sonic, i have his action figure... Just rented an episdoe and gonna get this movie soon.I watched it at my freinds house, me and him said it rocked!Now im gonna get it soon!Also,i have OLMOST every game(except old ones.). Now thats why Sonic fans love Sonic!"
4,Long-time Owner & User and Love It!!,"I have had my Prism for years now and absolutely love it. Loved it so much that when my wife was ready for a PDA, she got one too. We have Targus keyboards, the Magellan GPS, modems, Eyemodule camera, tons of memory and applications and now we can get apps and accessories for next to nothing!! She dropped hers the other day, broke the chassis, and will probably buy another--cheaper than repairing!! I was in a hurry in the car connecting the GPS, smashed the Springboard pins and will probably buy another as well!! Sorry for those with bad experiences, but we've had great service with ours. Obviously, a new power-user would want something more up-to-date, but for a student or someone like me who has had their Prism for a while, it still proves to be a great value!!"
2,handspring prism,"the product worked, but the batteries are no good, in only a day the batteries drain and the memory is lost! other than that i received everything i was promised!"
