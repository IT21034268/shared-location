2,a great disappointment,"I set this as the core tutorial text for an introductory unit in Director. The great majority of the students found it less than helpful. It led to deep confusion and frustration. It needs a thorough edit, not only for typographic errors, but for structural ones. Important basic information is left to the last 3 chapters. Many of the tutorials are just a show and tell, with limited educational outcomes."
1,THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL: THERE WANTED,BAD ACTING AT ITS FINEST. SUPPOSED TO BE A PARODY. CLINT WOULD PUKE AT THIS. DONT BOTHER. ITS GARBAGE ALL THE WAY. ENOUGH SAID. MIKE JACOBSEN 9-12-2009
1,Oh please...,"I was a student in Mrs. Steineke's class while she was writing/having the book published. Although her heart was in the right place in trying to help us all learn, I knew very few people who could stand her system. I personally felt like I was back in first grade. Although this system helped me to somewhat organize my thoughts, it was so rigid that it allowed very little of my own ways of doing things into the system. It also made me focus more on the actual guidelines of discussion rather than the material we were supposed to be covering. It really all comes down to value, do you value understanding of the material, or understanding of guidelines to discussion?"
4,New outlook on gardening,"I'll be honest...a devoted gardener I am not. But this book has given me a new viewpoint toward the art of landscaping. Basing her theory on the assumption that working folks simply don't have the opportunity to see their planting artworks during the day, the author makes us look at the evening garden instead. I certainly walked away from this book with a whole different outlook, specifically lighting, colour, placement, and sculpture. Most importantly, this book gave me the confidence to go out and try something new. Let the rest of the world hire landscapers to have look-a-like gardens. I shall focus on the gloaming."
1,Light on History or Descriptions,"The book contains excellent, black and white actual-size photographs of points and blades from the Eastern United States. The photos are labeled with the point name, approximate archeological period, typical states in which found, and approximate value to collectors.There are only four pages of general information text. There are no descriptions of material types associated with the photos.For someone interested in information on point methodology, material types, or significant historical information, the book will be a major disappointment. Additionally, though the title is ""Flint Arrowheads & Knives of the North American Indian"" I could find only three pages containing point types found in the Northern Western United States.For Eastern US collectors, the photos may be of some interest, but for a novice artifact hunter out West, information in the book is virtually non-existent."
5,Grab hankies before you settle in to watch . . .,"It's a wonderful (and tear-producing) look inside several unconditional love stories! Most of the humans are famous folks you'll likely recognize, but the stories have little to do with fame."
4,Piporro is the best,One of the best compilations of Piporro the famous. Altough a little bit dissapointing that it does not have Los Ojos de Pancha. A must have if you like Mexican Northern Music.
2,Ideological archaeology,"To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:""This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it."""
1,Hackneyed Biblical Minimalism,"The authors belong to the radical school of archaeology known as Biblical Minimalism that ignores the value of written history in evaluating archaelogical evidence and which sacrifices true objectivity in favour of the ideological standpoint that the Old Testament must be debunked at all costs. Much of what they say has been said by others in the past and found wanting. The main weakness of the authors arguments lies in their ""religious"" acceptance of the old Albright stratigraphy of Israel and the ignoring of the controversies surrounding the dating of strata and archaelogical finds. When these are taken into account the authors' view of things crumbles."
1,Was expecting an education book,"I didn't find this book to be educational as it was lacking in true archeological definitions, actual digs, and certainly lacking substance in ever observation stated."
2,An unbalanced unearthing,"Although Finkelstein and Silberman provide a great deal of interesting archaeological evidence, they align themselves with a ""school"" called the ""revisionists"" who tend to see Hebrew history with a jaundiced eye.For a more balanced viewpoint, see William Dever's ""What Did the Biblical Writers Know & When Did They Know It?"" Dever writes from some thirty years' archaeological experience and as a ""secular humanist"", who still sees archaeological ""convergences"" with biblical history. Though Dever sees biblical history as starting only with the book of Judges, he is able to trace the Canaanite origins of the Hebrews and their daily life through the divided monarchy."
3,"An interesting, but biased view","This book is a well-presented view of the minimalist archaeological philosophy, one held by a minority of archeologists. However, the author presents the book as revealing the current accepted archaeological theories. ...This book presents a very interesting argument, but it is important to keep in mind that this is one theory, and not the most accepted theory. It would be simpler to either accept the bible in its entirety or to reject it out of hand. However, the truth is somewhere in between. Read the book, but also read your bible and think for yourself."
2,A very focused book,"This is a good book showing why historically and through archaeology, a late date for the Exodus (anywhere from the 14th to 11th centuries BCE) would be impossible. Unfortunately, the authors do not even consider an earlier date for the Exodus.To receive a balanced look at all the possibilities, and a more equitable treatment of a wider range of archaeological finds, check firstwith William Stiebing's book, ""Out Of The Desert?"" This book came out quite some time ago, but much of the information is still current.Even though Stiebing himself is of the opinion the Exodus did not happen, a careful study of the archaeological finds presented shows the Exodus could have happened in the 15th century BCE, exactly where the Bible places it.(For those who think the Egyptian New Kingdom in the 15th century BCE was too powerful for an Exodus to take place, get a hold of Robert Drews outstanding book ""The End Of The Bronze Age."")"
5,Impressive,"DrEwgog (Croton NY)I have no expertise in this area; my only qualification to reviewing this book is my long-time involvement in treating with the demands of argument. I cannot speak to the accuracy of most of the data, but I can say that the writing is extremely lucid, the points are made logically, the support is provided in a convincing and very readable fashion, and the other side is handled in an effective and respectful manner. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to a rereading after I read Dever and some others on this very exciting subject matter."
1,Didn't work,Sound didn't work neither did tail light. I read another review where a woman had gone through three replacements and still didn't get one that worked. I quit after one.
1,This is the same old song different singer,"Moishe Rosen goes over the same old tired ""prophecies"" and proves nothing more than how hollow and silly are the claims of his organization."
4,Manipulator,"I was very happy with this product. It is a CD so it's not like i can tell you it works better than products like it, but it does have a bonus live performance that I enjoy."
3,Eh..,"I've been a Fall of Troy fan for years. They had an amazingly original sound, but with this new record.. i'm just not into them anymore. They changed. I was looking forward to something new, innovating, but still reminiscent of their old style. Nope. This CD is filled with everystyle you can think of. They are all over the place and can't seem to decide what sort of music to make. You have cheesy punk rock songs, a crappy blues song, an overly complex post hardcore song or two, mixed in with a lame attempt at a ballad.I don't know what happened to Thomas (the singer/guitarist/writer) but he had a good thing going when he made music for himself. Now it seems like he's just trying to please everybody, and it's not working. Atleast for me. maybe you'll like it."
2,"Average Science Fiction, Nothing New","Generation ships to the stars, rigid caste system that isn't so rigid, a main character who isn't compelling, and an adversary (can't call him villian) who we just don't care about. This stuff has been done to death, and in this case there is nothing new. I thought there would be some interesting plot turns when the opportunity arose, but alas, no.Ms. Matthews seemed content to write an average book with no real ""bite"" to it. There is simply nothing here to hold a readers attention. The science is straightforward, and the people seem to be wooden. The characters are in an essentially life or death situation, and yet they are reduced to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Average or slightly below. A true ho-hum of a book.Sorry, not worth any real effort."
4,Roller cosster Expirience...,"A Very nice experience for those who love roller coasters with explanation of the ""fun"" idea. You'll find here some of the best roller coaster in the world and even experience a little feeling like being on theme for real :)Ran"
4,Candy's review,"I like that it has the instrumental version and the radio version, but I wanted the unedited version as well."
2,"Beware the ""Strange Colors"" Problem!","Like many others, apparently, I have the ""strange colors"" or ""weird colors"" problem with this Sony LCD. This monitor swaps out certain colors with other ones, apparently not able to interpret color space information consistently. The ICC profile is squashed when you view it. It apparently happens on other size Sony LCD SDM monitors too. Skin tones on certain photos are swapped for hot purple, blues become hot green, certain User Interface colors are switched out too while others are unaffected. You can even watch a photo download--looking fine--only to go crazy upon the completion of the download. Went through all the standard troubleshooting, reinstalling systems, testing my hardware, calling tech support. Come to find out this monitor either works great or goes berserk depending on your particular CPU and graphics card. Not documented on Sony's site. Make sure you have a return policy."
3,"Great Track Selection, But...","All the songs were cut short, and the mixing sounds like a 12 year old did it. This is a great hard pounding house mix with a great track selection, hence global warm up mix. But the mix part of it never got accomplished. You will hear it when you listen to it. Skip this one and get the new Acosta. The mixing is alot better and the songs aren't all 4 minutes long."
5,Best of 3 brands I ordered,I had one 8 inch pan I recieved as a gift that I wanted more of but didn't know the brand. Turns out it was one of these Magic Line pans. When I went to order a second one I was distracted by other brands with high reviews. I ended up getting a 9 inch set of the Chicago line and a 9 inch square Fat Diddio pan as well as my second 8 inch of these. I was less impressed with the other brands. This line is so much sturdier. My white and yellow cakes come out so perfectly cooked and evenly but barely golden brown when I turn them out. Fruit upside down cakes come out perfect. The sides are strait and the whole thing is smooth with no name embossed or anything on the inside and they are thick! You can't bend these things. They will hold their shape forever. I can't think of anything to improve with these. I wish I'd ordered all the sizes I wanted in these instead of the other brands.
2,Good for novices to programming,I was given this book as an introduction to Java having come from a PowerBuilder background. For that purpose it's rubbish. I speed read the first 6 chapters without learning more than a paragraph of useful information. For novices to computing I can see the need for a book like this but for anyone else steer clear! The guys that reckon it's too difficult should look at changing degree courses ASAP.
2,Not so hot,"Rarely do I post a negative review, however I found this book to be a huge disappointment. Having recently read a number of great post-apocalyptic novels such as ""One Second After"", ""Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse"" (a *fantastic* compilation), and ""The Road"", I was eager to find more and so picked this up at my local library. After a great first story, my interest quickly waned due to what appears to be a hastily compiled collection of stories, some seemingly having fairly little to do with armageddon (I'd classify some of them as simply having a rather bleak storyline).Add the editor's almost incomprehensible political rantings into the mix, and you have a book I suggest avoiding."
5,Don't mess with my ducktail!,"Very wild rockabilly. Rudy Grazell's Ducktail is a classic. He recorded with some of the finest black rhythm musicians of the time (guitarist Mickey Baker from Mickey & Sylvia, guitarist Skeeter Best, bassist Leonard Gaskin, and drummers Bobby Donaldson and Joe Marshall). A little short collection but very good! And he wasn't famous till 1986 when some english promoter arranged him a tour of England. Can you imagine that?"
5,Gets the neurons firing double time,"This is an excellent collection of hard sci-fi shorts. The stories start on a groudwork of scientific/mathematical speculations and soar from there, exploring a diverse range of themes. Egan can truly envelope you in another world, and show the consequences of the story's central idea.Anyone with an innate curiousity for science/mathematics and a love of sci fi should definately check these out. I'm a little surprised that I'm the first reviewer."
4,As described,"Lots of wires, all differnt lengths, but kind of thin. Havent used yet with my BB830T boards. Nice case. Good buy."
3,Replace the Box,"The wires are great and make a circuit look very pretty.A picture for lab reports, without wires everywhere, acutally helped my grade.The box is awful. It came chipped and all the wires were unorganized."
2,OK for starters,"I like the compartments, but to be honest there are too many small pieces, you generally dont use that many small pieces, your better of buying a kit with longer wires in different colors, then you can cut a few small wires as you go along, other wise you are going to end up with lots off small wires that you'll hardly use."
5,Hitler's Speeches,"I have a copy of this book, publication date, 1941. Its a compilation of Hitler's public speeches from the early days through 1941. Refreshingly, the compilers were not selective in choosing which speeches to include nor did they drown the reader in opinion, commentary, or the kind of snide Liberal mealy-mouth one commonly finds in books about Hitler (Heitler). There is some historical background info provided before each speech.If you would like to read what Hitler said in his many speeches throughout his political career without predjudicial commentary, this is the book to read. You can learn what Hitler actually said, not what Liberal historians say he said."
5,What does it mean to be human?,"Are we hopelessly aggressive stupid apes? Is the stupid, aggressive, short-sighted-selfish behavior, which is so typical of our present society, also typical of our ancestors; or were they different. Is the blind and destructive impulse this society an aberration? Leakey argues that the fossil, paleontological, and anthropological evidence from millions of years ago and the present show that our current society is a dangerous aberration and degradation from millions of years of human and pre-human societies based on sharing and altruism. This is arguably one of the most important books ever written."
4,A good read,"My first reaction was ""Why would I possibly be interested in the House of M version of the Hulk? "" but I was pleasantly surprised ... it does a great job of incorporating both Bruce Banner and the Hulk in an alternate setting... I wouldn't say it's the strongest in the House of M collection but I can see why the other reviewer would come to that conclusion too ... all in all a good buy."
4,WAAAY BETTER THAN YOU THINK.,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and dealt with real issues. The jamaican friend is fine, and his accent it hot. He played on Seventeen Again with the Mowry twins. Watch it, you'll like it."
3,Interesting...,"A little ""out there"" as far as characters go. Maybe not entirely believable, but I enjoyed it none the less."
4,Really enjoyed this book,"A good read. Family reunion with lots of twists and turns. Enjoyed the characters and their tangled lives. Had a little of everything. Romance, murder, and family relationships."
5,damn.,"damn i love this album. gretchen has the sweetest and sexiest(!) voice ever. and songs like 'you closer' and 'grace' are, simply put, romantic lulabys written from a place where dreams come true after all."
2,Credible but muddy effort,"The greatest strength of this book is it's focus on making the business case for investing in human capital, and tying all HR activities to organizational strategy. It does a solid job of laying out a framework for implementing the HR Scorecard, which is made up of 4 components: ""HR Deliverables"", ""High Performance Work System"", ""HR System Alignment"" and ""HR Efficiency"".However, I found the writing awfully muddy, at times unclear, and often confusing. The book throws out definition after definition, and it's hard to tell where one ends and another begins. At times, the authors seem confused themselves, and there aren't clear distinctions between some definitions. It seems like they're just assigning definitions for the sake of assigning them. In addition, much of what they write is intuitive, and doesn't necessitate the lengthy and confusing descriptions.In short, I didn't enjoy reading the book, and as a result, I didn't get very much out of it."
5,Leading the HR golden age,This is what every HR proffesional must read and understand. It's a tool that helps and allows to make HR function as strategic partner to top direction.
2,Takes too long to get to the point,"Ms. Kurata is obviously an expert, but she often tells us too much. The book is too wordy for a great introduction to objects, so it's only fair in that area. (Try Peter Wright's books instead - they're great.) But it's not detailed enough and includes too much introductory material for an advanced objects book. (Better to try Rockford Lhotka's books for that.)Bottom line - it's neither fish nor fowl. When the VB4 version came out, it was groundbreaking and there was an excuse for it being too verbose. With two chances to clean it up, it should be a lot clearer and to the point by now."
1,"If you have already seen OOP, this book is a waste of time","I was expecting this book to provide a good introduction to implementing OO concepts in VB. Instead, it introduces a weak proprietary methodology (GUIDS) in software design, and follows that up with some terribly pedantic code. It's clear that the author has not kept up-to-date with developments in OO analysis and design--all of the references are at least five years old.All of the important information in Kurata's book is covered in one chapter of Deitel's _VB6: How To Program_--a much more straightforward and ""no nonsense"" way to learn this material."
3,You can probably do better,"While this camera does an acceptable job, you can probably do better for the money. The AUTO setting is very misleading. It is really more of a manual setting. I have been using a Milota camera for years and find it took better quality pictures with less need for adjustment. A friend told me that he has two relatives who actually returned Nikon digital cameras after initial use."
3,A Tiny Camera that Rocks,"This camera is deceptively small ...but don't be fooled it takes awesome shots and is easy enough for my 7 year old to use...as Paul Simon once sang ""I got a Nikon camera. Love to take those photographs..."""
2,Good camera while it lasts,This camerea takes good pictures under normal lighting conditions. It has a problem focusing in low light and the flash is weak. This camera is SLOW to take the picture after the shutter button is depressed. I would recommend this camera to people but it stopped working after 18 months.
4,Insert Title Here. Not bad.,"I've had this camera for a while now, and the picture quality is quite good. My main frustration is how incredibly long it takes to power-up, the major shutter lag, and also the fact that it takes a long time to preview through pictures because it blurs and then refocuses, and forget even trying to delete pictures on the camera .. takes FOREVER. I don't bother, I just delete them when I load it to my computer. On the plus side, I like the colors this camera renders in comparison with others out there.. I think it's a good camera if you're into taking just like.. artsy pictures of still objects, but not action ones since it is soo slow. and for people.. well people are impatient, and by the time you get the camera on.. it's like nobody wants to stay still for the picture anymore.Not a bad camera, if you're willing to wait for it."
4,nice combination,"for its features, there is no better combination than the coolpix 775. have to admit that the software was buggy but i have been using a pmcia card adapter to transfer pictures between my digicam and notebook. But if you look at nikontechusa.com, they have just released the new software a few days ago. try it to see if it solves your problems. the only bad thing i don't like is its slowness in flashing but then again, i haven't really finished studying the features yet so i might be using the wrong setting"
1,Nikon Coolpix 775 - Software Issues are Huge,"Nice little camera with lots of features. But don't let that fool you.There's a huge range of current computers with which the camera is essentially incompatable - my 1-year-old Dell Dimension, a widely distributed name-brand model - is an example. And the incompatibility in some cases is complete - no downloads are available to fix.We'd expect better of Nikon's software team. And as the issue is widespread, Nikon's customer service team has let the consumer down as well, by failing to identify the potential issues on the box..... My advice if you buy this - spend the extra to buy from a name outlet (about $75-$100 more), make sure you understand their return policy, and test the full range of functionality as soon as you get home."
4,Worked great until ...,This unit worked very well until it wore out. The plastic zoom lense assembly started binding. I used it fairly heavily for a little over a year and did not abuse it. I dropped it about 5 times and did not baby it.
2,Nikon coolpix 775,"Cons: this camera is heavy and bulky. For the price, it is only around 2 mega pixels which isnt good. I had this camera for a while then the zoom wouldnt come all the way out and it says ""system error"" every time i turn it on so i cannot use it anymore.Pros: the pictures turn out decent. It is a solid camera but do not drop it on the lens contraption because you will have the same problem of it not turning on and its garabe now."
2,Nice until it quit working,"All of the great things people have to say about this camera are true. Unfortunately, mine also stopped working after about 18 months. It had a system error, there is no hard reset button, and it will cost[$$$]to get it fixed. I still don't know if I'm going to get it fixed, out of warranty, or just go with a new camera."
4,the canon one is probably better,"I own the 775 and i have also used olympus 340L and D-450Zoom extensively for work. I also have used the canon elph? (not sure which model but it has 2.1 megapixels and it is smaller than the nikon).In my humble opinion:1. olympus cameras have better picture quality, my nikon tends to blur a lot because it is so light and hard to hold steady2. the canon can record sound on their short movies, as well as take continuous pics using FLASH, while the nikon forces you to disable flash if you want to take continuous pics. The canon seems to have a better lcd screen, the nikon's screen ""blinks"" when you move it...Overall, i think the canon model is better even though it is a little more expensive than the nikon... Keep in mind that the canon is made of metal and it is a lot heavier, though smaller."
1,malo,"Completely useless, I threw away my money. This is not a glass cutter???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!, please change its name."
2,Perfect for persons over 60's and light workout,"I loved the ballet class, but this video put me to sleep. Is to slow and I like more movement. I gave to my mother that have more 60 years and she liked , because is light and more easy to do. Stephanie do the dance for everyone.You can enjoy if you like light workout."
2,Different,"I prefer a more energtic workout. If you're looking to stretch and work on your grace when you have some time alone, it's great. I would never attempt to do this in front of my husband, since I'm not a dancer and look like a little girl TRYING to be - that's how I feel. For flexibility, this is a good video. For a workout, it's not for me. There are a few different programs on the one DVD, ranging from 10 to 35 minutes so you can choose your style and length of workout, tho."
1,for Pedro Infante ORFEON is not recommended,Although ORFEON carries quality artists at an extremely quality price it does not mean it has its downfalls. I don't think Pedro Infante EVER recorded for ORfeon. Hence the quality of ORFEON is BAD for an artist like Pedro Infante. So what label is recommended? PEERLESS. For Pedro Infante always go to PEERLESS. I buy ORFEON only for artist like Bribiesca or los tecolines. NOT Infante. The sound is BAD. I think ORFFEON owns the copyright for the music of his movies. And not even all his movies. one star for carrying the name Pedro infante.
5,Abraham Hicks hit,"I listen to this over and over again to make sure I am grasping all things stated,anything from Abraham is amazing and worth you while."
5,Great Product,"This product is wonderful, I noticed a difference in my skin 1 day after using it. I have mild acne, especially across my forehead, and since using this product, my face has cleared up significantly. I'll never use anything else, 5 stars!!"
5,Five fluffy stars!,"Dr. Alex Paterson is member of ""The Orb""If you like the Orb, You'll love this. If you're even remotely into the genre that the Orb defines (along old Aphex Twin, Orbital and FSOL) this is must-own material. I can't say it enough.Dr. Paterson's surreal soundscapes are ideal for contemplative drifting and relaxing. I would liken the sound to some of the mellow parts of the Orb's ""Orbvs Tererrvm"".Try it, you'll love it."
4,Excellent Texas style beer joint tunes,"This CD holds a wealth of above average americana songs. After listening to a couple tunes, I read the cover and it was obvious that ole' Charlie has some very good musical contacts. A couple of the names that stick in my mind are: Charlie Sexton on guitar and Gene Elders on the fiddle. I was also very proud to see that the CD was recorded in Austin...where else."
2,sign up for a remedial English class,"Self-published book with 100 alien encounters, mostly tending to the bizarre, like going to a shopping mall on the moon or meeting fellow abductee Charlie Sheen. The main problem is: most of the encounters are the authors', and the rest are their friends', so the 100 encounters are really only the experiences of a single abduction support group.The other problem is the horrible grammar, punctuation, and spelling. ""The aliens' are here, but we dont know they're motivation. The author tell's about your experience in malls in the moon."" Before you submit a book to a vanity press, you should either pass remedial English or ask an English major to do a grammar check."
1,Kukahi DVD,"I returned this product twice due to error message on all my video players ""cannot read disc"". I was never refunded for this product."
2,Dull and Not Witty,"Not what I expected. It is largely George W voice clips set to music (of sorts). Now GW alone is pretty boring, and setting him to music does not make him entertaining. What it makes is a boring, dangerous, stupid man sound even more stupid than he actually is (hard to believe). Not a keeper."
2,"Humorous at the end, but mostly tiresome.....","Much of the book is about a social climbing wife of a retired sea captain who inherits some money. The daughter for whom the book is named, is a minimal character in the book until later in the story. The daughter finally makes an entrance in the nick of time before the social climbing wife completely destroys both their marital happiness and their bank account. The daughter gets busy and eventually does manage to help her family get their priorities straight, complete with a happy ending. Unfortunately, the narration of the social climbing gets very tiresome. It is only in the latter part of the book that it becomes somewhat humorous.I had really enjoyed ""Galusha the Magnificent"" by the same author, so I eagerly downloaded other books by him. I will read one or two of the others with hopes they are more like ""Galusha"" but this one was somewhat disappointing."
4,48 THUGS,I LOVE FOXY BROWN I THINK FOXY N LL'KIM SHOULD GET TOATHER IN THEY BE OFF THE THING CUZ FOXY IS ROUT IT ROUT IT. THIS BWA IS ALL THAT..... NIKKI 48 4 LIFE
2,Talks too much junk,"Foxxy talks too much junk, This is just a whole bunch sexual bull. I understand sex sells but give me a break, let's learn some lyrical skills. This is truly a waste of money."
2,WHY,"WHY FOXY WHY I LOVED THE FIRST ALBUM. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS ONE, I WILL GIVE HER PROPS ON JOINTS LIKE ""4-5-6"", ""RIDE"", AND ""DOG & A FOX"" BUT I THINK THATS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ARTIST THAT FEATURED IN THE SONGS, THE REST OF SOUNDS LIKE BULL *_* _* _* _ . WHY IS SHE SOUNDING JUST LIKE LITTLE KIM THEN HAVE THE NERVE AND MAKE MENTION OF HER IN THE SONG ""MY LIFE"" AND WHY IS SHE RAPPIN ABOUT NOTHING BUT WHAT WHIP SHE ROLLIN, THE ICE ON HER WRIST, AND DOLCE GABBANA, BUT ONLY LANDING A CONTRACT W/ CALVIN KLIEN WHOM SHE NEVER MENTIONS. AND WHY DOES SHE SPEAK ON BEING HALF PHILAPENO, AND HER ALBUM IS TITLED CHYNA DOLL, FOXY IS DOING TOO MUCH. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THE OLD FOXY BACK. WHY."
3,It's A Great Album,"Foxy Brown Second Album ""Chyna Doll"" is one of the best rap album that i've heard for the last 3 years. after her first album ""Ill Na Na"" brown went on to become one of best rap female artist in the U.S.A.. The album is so great because it has hite such as ""Hot Spot"" and ""Chyna White"" which are so good that you want to buy the album just to listen to these hits. BROWN IS only 19 so she already has 2 smash albums is the market and her bright shining star is just getting bigger every second.In cunculion Foxy Brown for my opinion can and maybe is allready the best and biggest rap artist even bigger then missy elliott or lauren hill or even Salt N' Pepa"
1,CAN WE SAY WACK????,"First off jay-Z if you're gonna write lyrics for somebody write them for somebody with originality!!! This CD is so WAK, Foxy has wak lyrics, she's jocking Lil Kim's style, and can't do it! Kim will always be better than her. Foxy is unorganized an not experienced. She has the dumbest songs, this is a poor excuse for rap!"
3,"good, but not great","Only a few good tracks on this album Chyna Doll.""Hot Spot,"" ""The Job,"" and ""My Life"" the rest of songs are rather dull. Her first album Ill Na Na was by far better and earned her more success! I recommend her first album more than her second or her third! In Chyna Doll, Foxy just sounds too much like Lil' Kim, especially on ""Hot Spot"" There's too many damn male rapper guest appearances and annoying interludes, like the interlude where some chick is playin on Foxy's Phone and then bitchin her out at 4 in the morning. Stuff like that is annoying to listen to."
4,Foxy sounds like Lil' Kim on Chyna Doll,"Foxy sounds alot like Lil' Kim on her second albumChyna Doll. When I first heard ""Hot SPot"" on the radio inthe car with my counselor/friend Cecilia, i could've swornit was Lil' Kim but then the radio announcer said it wasby Foxy Brown. I was surprised. I bought the edited version of Chyna Doll. I like some of the songs, but not all.The reason is cuz there's too many male rap guests!and I hate the annoying intro! Songs I do like though are: ""I Can't Rock With You"" (feat. Total), ""The Job"" (feat. Mya),the remake of Salt-N-Pepa's ""Tramp,"" and ""My Life""A good album but I like her first one a whole lot better!Foxy seems shes trying to be nastier in her second album Chyna Doll and sound like she's Lil' Kim. Great photos of Foxy are inside the CD booklet cover! Buy this album today!!"
5,STICK WITH HER SHES GOING TO THE TOP,"FOXY BROWN HAS BEEN GREAT BEFORE BUT SHE SHINES ON TRACKS WITH MYA, TOTAL, MIA X, GANGSTA BOO, DMX, NOREAGA, AND MORE. THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM IS ""I CAN'T"" A DUET WITH R+B'Z TOTAL OTHER HOT SONGS INCLUDE ""CHYNA WHITE"", ""MY LIFE"", AND ""HOT SPOT"". SHE SHOWS HER HARDCORE STYLE IN SONGS LIKE "" DOG ANG A FOX"" (FEATURING DMX), ""IT'S HARD BEING A WIFEE"" (FEATURING NOREAGA), AND ""BWA"" (FEATURING GANGSTA BOO AND MIA X). BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,"TASTELESS, SLEAZY...Need I say more?","While ""Hot Spot"" is one of Foxy high points on this album overall this is pure thrash. On top of that for a sista who is barely 20 to be carrying and presenting herself the way she does is a personal embarassment and disgrace to me as a female. She claims that she is represents the sistas but I am sorry sweetie you're not represeting me because real sistas don't carry themselves that sleazy...Please Foxy you're only 18 act your age and carry yourself with alot more class than you do."
1,Be careful and beware,"Such a book is naturally biased toward favor of the technique. But readers should look up ""Shettles Method"" on the web and read up on more critical evaluations. For example, ""...adherence to these methods may decrease your chances of conception, without improving the odds of having a child of the gender of your choice. Note that caffeine has been linked to miscarriage, and douching has been linked to tubal damage and infertility."" and ""...in the New England Journal of Medicine, that has shown that 'for practical purposes, the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no influence on the sex of the baby.'""You can also find out the details of the method (such as a simple chart) before investing in the book."
1,Nice book but didn't work! :-),"I followed this book but it didn't work, please consider and don't get disappointed, every child is a blessing :-)"
2,"Interesting Scientifically, but DIDN""T WORK","I had high hopes for this book and method to work after reading all of the reviews, and while it was interesting scientifically, it did not work. In fact, both my friend and I read this book and followed it exactly. I kept a record for 6 months, and she did for 7 months. I just had my 3rd boy in June and she just had her 3rd girl in July. I wouldn't change having a 3rd boy for the world - I was obviously trying for a girl - however, if you truly care what sex you have and know you will be disappointed, then just don't have another child. I truly believe the odds are just 50/50 no matter what you do."
1,Waste of a good book and your time,"I bought this book just for fun but to also maybe try out the techniques to increase our chances of having a girl. I got it the other week and was bored with it immediately. It got a little interesting when it talked about the philosophies of old on female and male reproduction but soon went on to be boring again. Also, it said that when you want to try for a girl you are to have sex everyday. However, when you are trying to conceive doctors recommend every other day because if you do it too often the male sperm count gets too low to be effective. It also stated that if you are on the pill and you discontinue it you should wait 6 months before you even begin to start trying to conceive. I am on the pill and my doctor said that once I discontinue it I should have at least one period on my own before we start trying to conceive. This book is a waste of a good book, money and your time."
5,Excellent,"I felt that this book was for the most part an easy read. There were times that I felt that it was hard to stay with the writer, but mainly because I was anxious for the facts. My advice is be patient. If you do want to increase your chances for having either sex then you really need to read the whole book. Although you could skip ahead to the chapter that explains how to try to conceive each sex, but honestly you will be missing a bunch of helpful tips throughout the book. We are hoping it will increase our chances of the sex gender we'd like to have first this Spring! Be sure that you will be happy with either sex. Do NOT depend on this book to work miracles. The book merely tells you how to increase your chances of having either sex.Good luck!"
4,Some interesting info...,"First, I have not read this book nor have I tried this book, but I have read all the reviews, so I'm providing everyone with what I have learned from reading all of them. At this time there are 88 reviews. They break out as follows:*40 reviews, or 45% of the reviews say YES, IT WORKED FOR THEM*32 reviews, or 36% of the reviews were positive, but hadn't yet actually tried the method*9 reviews, or 10% of the reviews were negative, but didn't specifically say that they had tried it and had it not work*7 reviews, or 7% of the reviews had tried the methods and ended up with the opposite of the gender that they wantedHope everyone else found this as interesting as I did. Also worth noting, I didn't include people who said ""they knew someone who it worked for"", only people who said it worked firsthand for them (and there were quite a few people who knew others it worked for)."
5,"It worked,but I don't believe its for everyone","I tried the shettles method for a boy after several months of tracking my cycle. What worked for me in the end was using the ovulation kit the way shettles method says too. Some things I did differently was change my ph balance to favor boys. I did break a couple of rules though.We did not do the doggy style position and we did it more then once in that night. Although Im certain my timing and everything else was right. I do think the 20% it doesn't work for sometimes put negative vibes that because it didn't work for them then it doesn't work at all. Also if you can not handle having the gender you didn't want DO NOT DO IT. Any how for everyone else good luck I believe you really do increase your odds,but its not 100%."
2,"shallow, occasionally useful","Sometimes I find something useful in this book, but most the time it just sits on my shelf while I look things up online. I bought this because I wanted to make the transition from Linux user to Solaris user. In penguin-speak, this author did a --help on a bunch of commands and put them together in hard copy.If you think 1.5 pages on syslogd is something useful then buy this book. If you're a newbie then avoid this one completely."
5,Great music from veteren rockers!,Sounds like great rock from the 70's! A must see live concert! Anyone into early hard rock will love these guys!
5,Buy this book! (if you can find it),"Old Yeller is the alltime Gipson classic, but this one is a close second and noone knows about it. It by no means covers the same ground as Old Yeller. It is also a first person narrative by a young boy but the feel is very different. The Gipson hallmarks of golden youth tinged with tragedy are there, but the overall feel is more lighthearted. There is more humor, which Gipson is master of. The book is suitable for all ages and will be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to read it, and who is willing to pay 20$ or so to get a copy. It is very hard to find. I was on a waiting list for three months before a copy in my price range was available. If you want to just read it and not own it interlibrary loan will be able to scare you up a copy. And dont ""lose"" it after interlibrary gets it to you, if you do you will go straight to the lower levels of purgatory with the other book hoarders."
3,"Useful, but not a miracle-worker","This lens does what is says - it triples your current lens' magnification and makes things look much closer. However, do not expect miracles from it. The image is not quite a crisp and clear as your regular lens. You also have to re-focus after adding the Barlow lens, and it is a little more difficult to focus. Overall, it is a good lens but a stronger eyepiece might work even better."
4,The Green Beret Compass Course,This book has some useful techniques that I wasn't taught while in the US Army and I feel these could help many in a Land Nav course. Not a complete system but I will definitely implement elements of this into my bag of tricks.
5,Delonghi Urn is Great!,I purchased this coffee urn for my senior housing residents and they absolutely love it! It's great quality and we strongly recommend to others!
1,2 minute toy,"I value what Plan Toys is trying to do with its eco-friendly toys. However, I have bought my kids the gas station and fire engine and both have been played with for two minutes and then forgotten. My boys are ages 2 and 4. The toys are very well built and the wood is a plus. However, they are very basic. For example, the fire station has a garage door that opens and closes (manually) and then a sort of bell feature which is not very exciting. The gas station is a little more exciting with a car wash and gas pumps. But even this offers limited playing opportunities. I think that these toys are probably good when one buys the whole Plan City set: the airport, the carpark etc... But that is hundreds of dollars, and you are probably better off getting one of those train tables for $140 (which is a similar idea). I would not recommend these toys - they are expensive for what they offer...."
1,Propaganda,"I was forced to buy this for my college class and I thought it was a horrible ""textbook"". It pretty much doomed us all to Hades if we didn't stay married. It didn't explore the different types of marriage at all. It was very tunnel-visioned. I hated that it was required reading.Boo."
5,Really good unit,"This thing packs a punch power wise. Bright spot carries very, very far. Good amount of wide spill. This will light up an area 300 feet in front of you and 60 feet wide. Definitely an outdoor light, too concentrated a beam for indoors. Comfortable grip single mode powerhouse. Absolutely glad I bought it. My only minor complaint is the design is not a smooth transition. The black end cap is not quite flush with the rest of the body. It tends to hang up a bit when being pulled out of a belt holster. That is an easy fix though. Otherwise powerful, comfortable, good switch (glow in the dark as well) and feels real durable. Short run time but that is expected with the amount of lighting you get from 3 AAA`s. I still give it 5 stars and would buy it again."
3,Filled in some blanks from the first movie.....,"While this is a nice continuation from ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", it didn't have the same impact for me as the first movie. I felt it was rushed and all the information you needed was not provided on how things hooked up between the new journalist and Lisbeth. It did however provide background information into Lisbeth's mindset and what happened to her. Some parts I didn't feel were believable, but it did keep my interest far enough for me to want to see the last installment."
3,A bit of a lull in the middle of the trilogy,"This installment didn't command my attention likeThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoodid. Still, great performances and a fine mystery - and the wringer they put this girl through as the conclusion nears borders on torture porn. (That was a compliment.)"
4,Wanted to see all of this series,"We watched all three of these Swedish movies, hope they make more, they held our interest, we enjoyed them all"
5,Phenomenal Story!,"You absolutely must see ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" first; this takes off right where that one left off, and is even more exciting than the first. The actress who plays Lisbeth Salander is simply amazing. (You really should read the books first...the movie is great, but you'll get even more out of it if you read the books first.)"
2,"I would refrain from watching this movie, unless you have already read the book and know the storyline.","I loved the book, but was disappointed to watch this movie. So many things are missed, cut or moved, that it is hard to follow the movie, unless you already know the story line beforehand. I would NOT RECOMMEND watching this movie, unless you already know the plot or have read the book. Personally, I found the book to be more enjoyable than watching the movie."
1,bad just plain bad,"I have watched my share of stupid movies, but even I have to apologize to me eyes for subjecting them to this one."
1,"Ugh, I hope Hollywood uses a better screenwriter","Don't waste your time, the movie adaptation is terrible. Way to much left out and even if you had not read the book, the movie would be awful."
1,"One Rating for Prime, Not Movie",I started watching the The Girl Who Played With Fire (English dubbed) free with my Amazon Prime account and was a little over half done when I shut down my computer and went to bed. Now when I try to view the movie it says I have to pay to watch it. Is this Amazon's way of getting a person hooked and when they want to watch the rest of the movie they pull the line and try to reel you in with a charge?Has anyone else encountered this?
3,Lisbeth does not develop!,"I so enjoyed read this trilogy and could not wait to treat myself to the movies. After viewing, I wonder whether anyone who has not read the books could follow the storyline. I would feel so cheated if I did not know about Lisbeth's travels abroad, about the hurricane turned tornado, her murder of the abusive husband, her breast implants (that MiMi loved), and, especially, the growth and maturity she attained personally. Everyone who sees her back home notices the distinct change but we see the very same girl from book #1. The order of investigative sequence is very confusing, and there is no mention whatsoever of Harriet Vanger, who now sits on the board at Millenium. I know time constrainsts rule, but the moviemaker did Lisbeth Salander a serious injustice."
1,what a mistake!!!!,"It is not your fault, but for me this was a terrible purchase; I thought I was buying the video and instead it was an electronic file which I cannot even employ. I lost my money on this one. I wanted the DVD instead.Andre"
5,Exciting and suspenseful,Keeps your attention. You are conyinially challenged to keep up with theever growing changes in the plot and schemes.
4,siva,"this album is great, and hard to find. These guys are a great band from texas and have the stylings of sparta and at the drive in in a different light. Definately a must have."
2,"Tolerable sight, but just tolerable",In keeping with Meade's tradition of providing marginal sights for their ETX series of telescopes the 827 provides a tolerable sighting capability for the ETX 70 but suffers from poor construction and optical quality. With a bracket that utilizes the non standard mount holes of the 70 the sight provides a right angle sight (an improvement from their straight through sights). The sight will fall apart as you mount it and will require gluing to put back together. The crosshair will exhibit distortion. Usable but nowhere near the quality of an Orion sight of the same cost.
4,Great Concert,"I really like these guys music! This concert is really excellent actually as far as the music itself and the sound quality. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I reserve that high of a rating for a concert in which the music is excellent and the show itself is something special - like Pink or Madonna's for example. However, I do definately recommend this concert and I'm sure I'll give it plenty of listens in the future!"
1,Terrible!,"This guy really can't write. I've heard so much about Hubbard, so I picked this book up on a whim. It's the worst-written sci-fi book I've ever tried to read. The dialogue is incredibly artificial and the plot is pretty thin. I only managed to get a couple of chapters in. Don't bother."
3,flb's typically beautiful prose in an un-typically bad book,"i rushed to the bookstore to buy v&c just days after it came out because i generally adore anything written by flb, but i was sort of disappointed with this book. the story has alot of gaps in it and the portion of the book that violet narrarates seem particularily rushed. the claire part reads alot more comfortably. her beautiful poetic descriptions are still there, but even they seem forced. i would recommend this book to a fan of francesca's, but not to a firt time reader. she's done much better in the past."
2,ummm...definatly not her best,"I love Francesca Lia Block, but, I have to say that I found this book rather boring. It was just really slow and, just, I don't know I just didnt like it very much"
3,Not as good the second time around..,"I loved this book when I first read it but reading it again this year dissapointed me. First off, I get tired of Francesca always using these magical fae girls in every single one of her novels. It gets tiring quite fast. I mean, I adore a sort of alternative vibe running around in her novels but the adoration of Tori Amos (who I do love by the way) and being into zines and things of like is not really realistic. In a lot of ways; her novels aren't really showing teenagers as they are.But, I do enjoy how she writes as whole and that her works are always clever to a degree. But when I read it once more; I thought that this book wasn't as magical as I percieved. I seriously wanted to bash Claire with her faerie wand and push Violet from her Hummer while it was moving. The main characters grated me that badly.Read Echo or Girl Goddess #9, way better books."
4,Poetic and Interesting,"This book was endearing in some ways but a little confusing. I loved the characters and you really could tell what they were feeling. Violet is severe at times but her thoughts and actions are understandable. Claire is so kind and innocent to outsiders but I liked getting to know her from her own point of view. The imagery and poetry were better than in any other book I've read, which is the main reason I like this book.But in Claire's chapter, she brings up some issues from her past and never fully explains them. There are problems with her parents and her childhood that are mentioned that are never really made clear.Other than these unanswered tidbits, this is a wonderful book full of poetry and imagination that shows how even the bad things in life can be resolved."
4,"girls, Girls, GIRLS","This is the only book I've read by Mrs. Block, but as a 15 year-old I have to say so far I love her work. In Violet and Claire she gave vivid descriptions about the two only phases that most teenage girls go through. I know alot of people who have Violet's attitude. The type that at a young age scarred their arms with razor blade, and now all they can think of is making movies or being in movies. Then there is the Claire Type who get beat up in school everyday because they have that innocent look that reassures you they won't try to hit you back. You have to read this book you, won't be able to put it down."
5,magic,"When I first saw this book I was at Barnes and Noble with my family and I was browsing. I happened to uncover Violet &Claire. I stared at it for a moment, not knowing why I felt like I was perching on a star- after all, though I have always loved FLB, I had never felt this enraptured just by looking at a book she had written. Needless to say, I bought it, and read it in the solitude of my room, which quickly turned into LA, the city where Violet and Claire lived. After reading this book, and closing it, I felt like I had been to heaven and had suddenly dropped down to earth again. This book is pure magic, and underneath it's darkness it sparkles with poetry."
4,VIOLET,"Violet: loner and gothClaire: Loner and faery wanna become together in this story. They become true friends. They want to do everything together, especially make a movie due to Violets obsession with classic cinema. Life gets more complicated when people come inside the world of violet and claire, can they make it through the ups and downs of life? Go get it, its a wonderful, uplifting story about friendship."
3,Works for Kindle Fire but . . .,"I ordered this because I was having charging issues w/ my Fire (come to find out there was something wrong w/ it & I got a replacement).This charger works well & it is nice to have an extra but the odd thing is if I am reading while it is plugged in it makes the screen very sensitive & jumpy. It took me a while to figure this out! I thought once again I had a messed up Fire.Also, it charges alot slower than the real charger."
1,waste of money,"i bought this to use with my kindle fire, as my orignal charger got in a fight with my cat, and the cat won..... I used this charger for about 2 weeks untill it no longer worked. at first i thought there was a problem with my kindle it's self, but as it turns out it was a problem with this charger.... No, I would not recommend this to another person, not unless you like to throw away money..."
2,Not so good for combat,"After a few snap opens the fan started to fall apart, but other than that will work to move the air."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"I ordered this box, seeing the previous reviews of the horrific color they had received instead of the green. I thought that since they were from 2005, the company probably got it straightened out...but, no! They didn't. Peach, green, and brown. Very ugly. Don't buy!"
1,Please enter a title for your review,"watain's music is sheer mediocrity in every aspect. no metal band has ever got so much credit for doing so little. there isn't a fraction of originality anywhere in their sound and they're barely competent musicians. they don't even have the lo-fi atmospheric production most new school black metal bands use to disguise their poor musicianship. if they at least had some atmosphere in their production i would get it, but they don't, they have nothing. are they supposed to sound like motorhead? is that the point? because if it is they do it well, but it's so easy to do, and the reason other black metal bands aren't doing it is because they're exercising some limited creativity, trying to make their guitars more buzzing or their vocals more piercing or their drums more clattering, superficial goals but it's at least more than this band is doing."
5,Brilliant Black Metal At It's Best.,"There is not a bad song on the album. It's varied, emotional, creative, with excellent musicianship, and beautiful evil journey beginning to end. Atmospheric without relying on keyboards or computers. There is some Dissection influence, but still entirely unique. This is genuine, sinister, satanic black metal with compelling, powerful vocals. It's more cleanly produced than the other albums, which works just fine. This thing has lived in my cd player almost continuously since it first came out. If you haven't heard these guys you really need to."
5,Big Beats in sheer delight!,"If you forget the hype and actually listen to the 11 songs presented on the album, you will notice a number of things. First, there is creativity in every song, from Kool Roc Bass to my personal favourite, Battle Flag. Not only do the lyrics explode with vengence, but are themselves worth listening too...they are simply crazy!Stick it in the CD player and switch to continuous repeat. You wont be disappointed.My only worry is the fact that The Wrecked Train (lead vocals) has quit the band. Lets hope they continue to shine."
2,Oh well,Battleflag was the only thing that rocked I didn't like the rest at all. Nothing sounded nearly like that one good song.
3,Different...,"The truth follows:Don't be discouraged by the samples on this page; they don't really reveal the real music. The Allstars play some good, hard music like Prodigy and Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. They are probably the least original and interesting of them though. The best tracks are 1 (*way* too short), 2, and 7 (of course). One big problem with every song is that most of them take at least a minute to get started. The vocalist-speaking guy is incredibly annoying at times. Still, not a bad big beat CD and pretty unique."
2,"An okay debut release, but this band will be BIG.","I listened to this CD at a music store (I forget the name) and, because the LED that showed the track number of the song was broken, I heard all of the other songs before ""Battle Flag,"" obviously the best track on the CD. Out of the ten tracks, three are pretty good to excellent, four are bad, and the remainder leave you wondering, ""What the heck was that?"" And another thing, what IS it with British bands having blurbs at the end of their songs? Chumbawamba did that, and now these guys? Why can't they just end the track like American bands?"
2,"""Painfully Funny"" or just painful?","The back of the DVD package quotes a reviewer from The New Yorker describing this movie as ""A Radiant Comedy"", with the cover synopsis going on about how ""painfully funny"" this film is -- but to most non-New Yorkers the film has all of the nuanced sensitivity of a New York cab driver, and to many the rude, cruel, non-loving human behavior depicted here will seem not ""painfully funny"" but just plain painful."
2,A letdown,"Issues abound in this story of a group of people living in New York City, all of whom have differing problems. Stories of dysfunctional people interacting with each other would normally be good for a touching combination of laughs and tears, but the humor just was not there, and I did connect with these characters."
5,Great recording,I greatly enjoy the complete nature of this DVD. It includes the often omitted 1st act chorus whose removal robs the opera of so much of its power. Not to mention the lead singers are Domingo and Freni... need I say more.
4,A Brave Step,"After two albums of great work with a standard jazz line-up, Herbie Hancock made the bold step of recording a jazz album without any horns whatsoever. The result is always intriguing, but not always engaging. Highlights include ""Succotash"" (good name, that), and the odd ""A Jump Ahead"". Herbie Hancock fans, and those who are looking for something a little different, will probably want to check it out."
3,repetative,"This book was well written, and explains the chronolgy of physics. Although when David Lindley describes a certain topic he extends the information too much. A one paragraph summary of a topic gets extended at times to many pages. A difficult read if you are under 14"
2,Item not as pictured,I bought this set thinking it was a light pink - like the picture - but it's not. The pink is a hot pink or a dark fuschia so I have to return these. Bummer - they would have been perfect if the color han't been misrepresented online. There's no way the color I received could have been photographed incorrectly. The seller should have made a note in the description that the photo is not the color of the item. They seem like nice quality but not what I wanted.
4,"fun, especially the removable treads","For better or for worse, my 2yo and 4yo LOVE taking the treads off these trucks. They are easy to put back on, and no harm done, but I kind of wish they'd actually play road construction more and toy destruction less. Oh well, at least they like the trucks! As with all Plan Toys, the construction is good, the detail is charming, and the paint is SAFE. And HOORAY for not being made out of plastic!"
4,"Cute, but have had some issues","We do a lot of Plan City in this house, so these were an easy addition to everything else, however, we've had some problems. 4 year old dropped the steam roller on the kitchen floor and one of the pins holding the roller to the frame broke off - odd - it must've fallen at a strange angle. Very difficult to fix - and our first attempt failed so for now, it's out of commission. Then, the bulldozer got stepped on - again, by a 40 pound 4 year old, and the whole ""pusher"" thing came right off. We were able to glue this back on and it seems to be holding up okay. And yes, the rubber track-style ""wheels"" do come off pretty easily. Not to say the kids don't like them - they LOVE them, and most of the Plan City stuff they have has been very, very durable, so I was surprised that two broke so easily in less than a month -- my kids usually aren't so hard on their toys...."
2,"Too small, low light","Overall, we really like the Meade telescope we bought. But this eyepiece probably won't be used very often.First of all, the viewing hole on the eyepiece is TINY. It's tough to find anything through it.Secondly, the loss of light when using this piece is so significant, that it's more worthwhile to just view it at a slightly lower magnification.You're better served buying one of the lower magnification lenses, and using a 2x or 3x Barlow lens with it."
3,A rather weak album saved by three excellent songs from being a total disaster.,"This 1986 release, while not a total failure or a complete washout, falls short in many respects. Its biggest problem is that the electronic keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines and other electronic instruments which had become so popular and pervasive by the mid-1980s take center stage on most of the songs and take the spotlight away from Ashford & Simpson. The only three tracks that are truly enjoyable (and which feature some very inspired songwriting and compelling vocals) are ""Count Your Blessings"", ""Nobody Walks In L.A."" and the slightly philosophical ""What Becomes Of Love?"". The other five tracks are real letdowns and leave plenty to be desired."
4,good book for generating dialog,I saw this book recently featured in an article in a print periodical about child developmentWe've recently had minor problems with our 4-year old son acting out after preschool on days when he had been picked on by other kids. We got the book and used it is a bedtime story. It generated good dialogue (as good as you get with a 4-year old) and it made him think before he acted. It gave him some tools to use with the more physical kids so he resolves the problem in the moment without resorting to aggression. Wthat he doesn't have to resort to acting out to make the behavior stop. I am glad that I purchased this book.We bought also 'Words Are Not for Hurting' and that one was not as useful for generating dialog.
5,Hands Are Not for Hitting,This book is not only well written but also well illustrated. Instilling in children nonviolence and ways to avoid and deal with situations that arise with other playmates is so needed in today's society. My seven yr. old nephew couldn't put it down. He loved it and interacted as he read it.
3,Very accurate but cumbersome,"It's a simple test, two reagents, 1 tray. It's pretty accurate as far as I can tell, I just did not like the way I had to do the tests. Fill the dropper full, put in tray, add reagents, then stir with the included stick. I chose to buy the API version instead."
5,Best Bang For The Buck,"If growing creatures in your aquarium such as SPS corals, Clams, etc., that require phosphate levels below 0.04 ppm this is the test you should use, it has a precision of 0.05 ppm. This is the most accurate phosphate test kit available except from high end electronic kits, and the more expensive Salifert brand, the rest are simply not accurate enough to raise these types of creatures. Most have a maximum precision of 0.15 to 0.25 ppm, not enough precision considering that above 0.10 ppm most SPS corals will slowly decline and eventually die."
1,Salt water test kit,"This test kit is for salt water only, don't waste your money if you have a freshwater tank. It should be clearly marked ""For Salt Water Only"". It is not."
3,Same Book as Jewelry & Gems Buying Guide,"The content in this book is almost identical (page for page) to certain sections of Jewelry & Gems: The Buying Guide--How to Buy Diamonds, Pearls, Colored Gemstones, Gold & Jewelry With Confidence and Knowledge (5th Edition). While the content was good, I was looking for something more in-depth. This was not it.So, if you have Jewelry and Gems, don't buy this book. If you do not, this is a good introduction to colored gemstones."
5,great cd (but listen before you buy),This is a wonderful cd but if youy don'tperticullarly like new age pop-rock listen first. My boyfreind hates pop-rock but he likes C'est la vie. If you think I'm lyeing just listen.I lovedthis cd . my friends got this for my b-day.heres an Idea if you like rock cheak out Offspring!
3,"Fun show, but quite fictional","My husband and I like this show, but there is no way it is realistic, financially speaking. This review covers it pretty well: [...]"
1,Not for school children,"School librarians, please look over this book before purchase. We sent it back. This is geared to adult humor. It is not a vocational guidance book."
5,Great for this price,"This is a very good reference book for anyone who is buying their first purebred kitten. There is some background information on Ragdolls, advice on finding reputable breeders, care instructions etc. I have found that most cat books are full of fluff and outdated information, but this book I found actually practical and useful. I loved the color photos. Yes, it is a short book and does not give every bit of information about the breed, and if that is what you are looking for then you will not like this book. But what can you expect from a book of this price and size?BTW, a reviewer below is a bit mistaken. Not nearly all breeders insist upon killed virus for innoculations, only some do."
5,heart-rendering,"for those of you who long for or have been searching for the ""real sound"" of OLD MEXICO, the sound that brings on a feeling of now understand why, this is the music to buy. this music is not tex-mex, nor is it the stuff you hear in Mexican Restaurants while you eat sour cream on a burrito. this is the original stuff. this lady impresses me more than any singer i have heard. try it. [....]"
3,"Very good to excellent at times, but not consistently good","I agree with the earlier reviewer who said the guitar solo on Island of Jewels is great. I think I would go so far as to say it is THE best guitar solo I know of. Along with Island Of Jewels, At A Turtle's Pace and All Along The Watchtower are also very good, but I feel that a number of the other tracks are weak. I have several of their vinyl EPs, and I'm glad that the songs I liked best (those mentioned above) are included on the CD. I learned of Winter Hours around the same time I learned of O Positive, and I feel they are somewhat similar -- some very good songs, but not very consistent in quality (O Positive was perhaps more consistently good, but they still can't touch Island Of Jewels' guitar solo!)."
1,disapointing,"was really looking forward to this shipment--I remember Sapporo from my younger years in San Fran. Spice packs were everything I remembered and loved but the noodles had a funny ""off"" taste, like the oil they used to fry them was waaaay past prime. Finally just ripped out the spice packets and used ramen noodles from grocery store. will not order again."
4,Good but pricey,"These do taste better than the cheap brands like Maruchuan, and you get a slightly larger (3.5oz block), but these are WAY more expensive. I've seen them in local Wal-Marts for a slightly lower price. Overall they do have a good flavor, not too salty or mushy."
2,Bad acting and stereotype,Two stars is generous but I have to be a little biased having a couple of relatives in this film (one with a major role). The movie direction is straight from the Spike Lee school of filmaking. The story line is cliche but easy to follow and I can appreciate what the writer/director was trying to do. This is a low budget film so I can't blame them for the acting and poor production quailty.
5,Only bought it for a bug out tool,"This is going in the B.O.B.. I'm sure it will find several uses if the situation ever calls for it. I bought this style as opposed to other name brand multi tools (leatherman, sog) because of 1 reason, the locks for each tool, they all will lock into open position and you have to release them to close it. I don't know how many close calls ive had in the past when a non locking knife has tried to close on my fingers while being used, this will eliminate that. I still have all 10 digits and wanna keep them too."
1,horrible,"This eyepiece has such bad eye-relief that even if you push it into your eyesocket as hard as you can, you still can't see full field of view. the actual glass is only half the size of my 3.6 mm celestron nexstar pl. Also the quality of view(what little you can see of it with such small eye-relief that is) is also the worst i have seen in any eyepiece including some realy cheap eyepieces i have."
4,Love it but it gets sooooo dirty!,"I love this couch IN A WAY. It is the perfect size for my daughters' room. Everyone has commented on how cute it is... she uses it to lay down (the sofa bed), her friends use it to sleepover and she uses it just to sit down. BUT BUT BUT it gets sooooooooooo dirty so quickly because its chenille and attracts everything to it. I wish i could find just the cover to replace it! Otherwise, it was worth the money."
5,Good product,I bought this to see if it helped with my thyroid and energy problems. This worked quite well and had good service
1,Did nothing for me,I think the title says it all. Bought these on a recommendation in a magazine article. Nothing changed.
5,Totally awesome,"Pearl Jam is my favorite band(barely above Pink Floyd) and this is definately my favorite album. EVERY SINGLE SONG is good. It doesn't have some hits, but they put some new stuff in it. I listen to it all the time and don't get sick of it. The extended version of daughter is awesome. That guy that says U2 is better is crazy. They're good but not like Pearl Jam."
4,almost perfect,"I've read the other reviews and okay, the sound isn't as good as it could be. However, don't let this stop you from listening to this cd. I think it was a good decision to stay away from a lot of the old songs, though I wish they played Jeremy and rearview mirror. You can get the old songs from the 'live in Atlanta' cds. The new songs were excellent and the version of 'off he goes' was more amazing than the studio version. I wish they would put out another live cd with B sides and the other songs, including yellowledbedder, tremor christ, rock'n in the free world, leaving you, etc. Keep up the great work PJ!!"
5,Pearl Jam at its best: a classic live collection,"I bought ""Live on Two Legs"" at midnight on the night of its release. I have anticipated the album since the first time i heard a mention of a forthcoming live album - and, as always, the album surpassed my expectations... The band sounds tight, the selections are classic, the renditions meet, and often surpass, the original studio recording. I'm hoping they'll release another live album soon with more of their stuff, and some of the rarities from the tour (I was really hoping it'd end with ""Baba O'Riley"" rather than ""F*ckin' Up"") but everything on the album fits perfectly. I was saddened when it came to an end, some five minutes ago... I'm going to go listen to it again, something I forsee doing for quite some time... Pearl Jam live is the best way to hear them, and if you can't make a concert every day, this compilation will tide you over till they come your way again."
1,Lilliputian charm with poor workmanship,"I order from Amazon frequently, and am consistently happy with the products and service. However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description. I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it. It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide! The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others. It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended. I'm sending it back for a refund."
5,Great product,"This blade really gets close, its just like shaving, but without the use of a razor. I highly recommend this product. Just remember before you use your blade for the first time,run it through some type of blade wash solvent to get factory protective film off. That way you get the best cut possible."
1,Disappointing treatment of a very interesting subject,"Published for the juvenile market, this title offers little more than cursory information in its meager number of pages. Anyone looking for detailed information about past MH-53 missions or comprehensive pictorial reference material will not find it here. The selection and quality of photographs is especially weak."
2,Nose Dive....,"I really liked the energy and the melodic intertwining guitars(Doug and Scott's) of the Treepeople, and this is a project with some of those remaining members (from 'Actual Re-enactment'- no Martsch). Stuntman isn't achieving that level of unity like earlier Treepeople had though. I like Schmaljohns songs (tracks 3,5&9). Track #10 is an awesome ripping instrumental that stands out above the rest. But the remaining tracks are pretty weak. They have energy, but are not very inspired and are kind of forced sounding. John Polle's vocals sound kind of cutesy to me, especialy next to Schmaljohns, and his lyrics are unrefined.I got this album when it came out but didn't keep it. But..... if you really liked 'Actual Re-enactment', you'd probably want to get this."
5,B*WITCHED ROCKS!!,"It totally love B*Witched!!! They rock!! This is my very favorite song and I have loved it from the first time I hear it! The only bad part about this single is that ""We Four Girls"", ""Rollercoaster"", and ""To You I Belong"" are only snippets off the original album. Still, the CD rocks and ""The B*Witched Quiz Show"" is hilarious!!"
4,These Girls know how to have fun,"This Cd is a great album with some fun music indeed. It is abou ttime we got back to groups that not only have good music, but fun music. Although some of the remixes of ""C'est La Vie"" are a little repetative, the original mix, is great as im sure anyone who has heard it will agree. Furthermore, their track ""B*witched Quiz Show"" is hilarious, (i refuse to ruin it for you and tell you what it is about) but is well worth it. If anyone is wondering why four and not five, i have to say that the remixes really are a little dull, but the rest is a gradn time indeed. Well worth the $5."
3,Sea Painting,If you want to learn 'Sea and Surf...this book is for you....Robinson also has a DVD available...or might be VHS.....Watercolor
5,Older text well worth reading,"I bought this book out of curiosity, as Runyan's golf era was long before mine, but wound up using more of it than I anticipated. It is an excellent book on short game strategy and the basics of producing various trajectories from different lies. I found it more concise and an easier read than the Dave Pelz ""Short Game Bible"", probably the closest modern equivalent. I've modified my chipping and putting strokes to match each other, as Runyan advocates, and have been getting excellent results."
1,Ritek has major problems.,"I was a loyal Ritek user for some time. I bought these exact discs in May of this year and burned them on a number of drives. Scans at the time showed very low error levels. This weekend I rescanned and ALL the discs had increases in error levels of over 1000%, many were barely readable. Draw your oown conclusions."
5,Fantastic!,"The always dynamic and versatile Houston at her best. The always underrated Rockwell is brilliant. Grew up with an absolutely insane mother? Have scare tissue from your past? Found more questions than answers to your neurosis? Accepted in the end who you are? Know that no one screws up little boys more than their mothers? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, any of it resonate with you, then watch this film. I know I broke a few bones watching it."
3,It's ok,"If I had not ready the book, this movie would probably be somewhat confusing. It's already only 1 1/2 hrs long and moves at a very fast pace. I liked the movie, mainly because I am very familiar with the book. However, I probably wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you read the book first."
5,Pucker up to kiss a great song.,"Sispence none the richer's first single ""Kiss me"" is absolutely wonderfully with deep and thoughtful lyrics along with the catchy of tunes. It makes you wanna get up and sing along and go ahead and do so because you'll be right in place with this newest smash hit."
4,*KISS ME* awsome,i love the song the tune is incredable aaaaaaaahhhhh i love it i love it i love it :P
2,"childish, annoying","How old is this girl anyway? I don't think I can remember a voice as annoying as this girls'.When a song has the lyrics bring,bring,swing swing it should be classtfied as kindergarden material.Irritating enough that I hope someone kills her and doesn't kiss her."
1,"a mix between a whine, a beg, and puke","Whine::far from cool; anoying; you call it ""music""? Beg::im surprised it isn't ""kiss me or die"" Puke::you will do this :(~!$#%#@&$^%"
3,Flattened out,"I liked this pillow at first because it's firm and small enough to give me good neck support, but it's kind of flattened out and so i need to puff it up before i sleep on it to give me good support again. By morning though, it flattens out again."
2,Disappointed,Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with my pillow. I should have ordered a larger one as this one is very small. It does seem that it would be a comfy pillow if it was bigger.
2,Sobakawa Pillow,"This pillow was extremely disappointing. I ordered it for my husband as I have one. It is listed as a standard pillow, it's more like a pillow to fit in an infant's crib. I paid almost 30 dollars for this pillow, I expected it to be smaller as I read the other reviews but I wasn't expecting to get a pillow small enough for a child or a baby. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,gaseous,"I'm an annoyingly ardent fan of Ackerman's A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES, and was certainly looking forward to this.Unfortunately, I think her work here actually has less to say and is less delightful. It is more self-consciously lyrical -- and that winds up being pretentious.I think it the book is also disorganized. And unlike the stunning science she writes about in A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES, I don't think she has much to say here. I also think she's on shakier ground when it comes to the actual cognitive neuroscience: whenever she wades in too deep, she extricates herself by writing poetically about ""the mind."" This becomes transparent.It's certainly not as mind-blowing as other stuff I've seen her do."
1,You will be extremely disstisfied,"The whole story tutored in the movie seems to be unrealistic. A history piece presented by 21-st century men. The film failed to show customs and cruelty of early 18 century. Some parts are really lengthy and dull with no meaningful impact on action. Binoche is sailing around in her skirts without showing open passion either to her husband (except the unnecessary and out of taste nude scene) or to the murderer. Seems that she only pretends that she really cares about the guys. I guess she just looks for a strange way to escape thoughts about hanging herself because of boring island life. I have a feeling that the whole ""male"" cast (mostly unknown actors) is poking around Binoche. Her suppose-to-be husband and that other guy are of no match to her as actors. If you are up to a real character played by Binoche you better stick to films where a) she plays with great names as Fiennes and b) she plays less morbid character."
3,Serves its purpose,"I only use my treadmill a few times a month, just to mix up my workouts, and because I spent a lot of money on it a couple of years ago when I was really into running (obviously not anymore).I don't have a TV where my treadmill lives in the basement and decided to try passing the time with books.I've had this for about a year and it really is just ""ok"".It wiggles around quite a bit on my mode (ProForm XP 580), but does clip over the top and has never fallen off. It does rest on some of my buttons, particularly the speed increase, and sometimes if I move just right, it will increase the speed.I will continue to use it with the same infrequency this coming year and glad I purchased it for such a low price.I purchased one for my mom and her model treadmill is much older and she doesn't have problems with wiggling or moving and absolutely loves hers."
3,Treadmill helper,This book holder helps keep me on the treadmill but I worry about how long it will last. The plastic is thinner than the ones I used at my previous YMCA furnished.
1,doesn't fit,I purchased this item when I purchased a schwinn 240 recumbent exercise bike. It does not fit on the front consol of bike. It is too narrow. And now that I have assembled my bike I noticed that there was a crack in the corner of this book holder. Another useless item. Says it will fit both exercise bikes and treadmills. They were wrong!
5,"Treadmill Book Holder/Large, is Perfect!","Just what we needed and as expected. This handy acrylic see through rack fits perfectly over our new stationary bike, holding a 2 inch hard cover (open), or a small paperback, TV remote and/or phone. Easily slides up, left or right to manage LED on the bike's monitor. THank you! It's perfect."
5,Essential method for clarity in every area of life!,"I read over 50 books per year, as a professional speaker I am always on the look out for new ideas. After the Bible, I believe Yes or No to be in the top 5 of all the books I have ever read. Brilliant in its simplicity, brevity, style, and content. The audio version is stunning. GET IT"
1,below average hardware.,"I called up dlink to ask for a recommendation for a QoS router i could configure. After receiving this item my performance for video streaming actualy got worse. I also found my configuration options pretty much consisted of QoS on or off. Couldn't turn the firewall completely off, i suspect the hardware can't handle very high data rates dispite being a gigabite router."
5,Water Bottles,The product got here very quick. I was quite surprised when it arrived. I breed Pugs and Bostons and these are a life saver for pups. It keeps them from getting their water all nasty and contaminated. It was just what I wanted and needed. Thank You so very much.....
4,Follow the instructions-no leaks,"We've had this for over a month now for our guinea pigs. It comes with the most explicit directions I've seen on a water bottle. As other reviewers noted, you need horizontal bars (2) at the correct distance apart to hang this. You do need to use both hangars or it leaks. We always fill the bottle full of water (never partially full), and when you invert it to hang, it does squirt water and then does a slow drip while building a vacuum. If we're lucky, one of the guinea pigs decides to drink while it's dripping, and then it stops soon after. We have a plastic container to catch drips under the water bottle, and with this water bottle, it never overflows. We always had problems with the previous two (smaller) water bottles that would slowly drip over a couple of days and fill up the container and get everything wet. I'd give it five stars but it does need the horizontal bars and it does get stuff wet when you initially hang it."
5,Lixit Water Bottle,"Needed a larger water source for my Cockatiels (not rabbits). This one fits the bill, was easy to install, has the ""ball end"" I needed, and provides 1/2 gallon of fresh water to the outside aviary."
2,Had to throw it away,"We bought this to keep water off our dog's beard hair. Dog is 7 pounds.. Three issues caused us to throw it away. First, we couldn't figure out how to stop those little drip drip drips. Over night all the water would come out. Also the screw cap had to be put on jusssst right or the water would gush out around the cap. The cause seems to be only 1 1/2 thread engagement between screw cap and bottle. As a result screw cap has to be put on carefully to make sure no under tightening or over tightening. Third, if the bottle wasn't mounted perfectly vertically then the water would drip out faster (this seems to the way with all of these type lickers not just Lixit). The fourth issue was the dog had to lick lick lick lick a lot to get enough water especially in hot weather. We ended up buying and a 1 quart round Lixit with a bigger pipe. If we mount if vertically then it only drips a few times before it stops. If you have a dog without a beard we suggest using a water bowl."
2,Awkward & dangerous handles,"As another reviewer noted, the loose handles are impossible to lift up when you've got potholders on in a hot oven.Otherwise, nice size for a turkey, easy to clean. But I'm giving it away."
1,Good size but poor quality - keep shopping,"I think I got this as a promo when I bought some of my other cookware, for either free or only a few bucks. There are a couple positive notes. The pan is good size and the rack is sturdy.But after a couple months of light use (and hand washing), the ""nonstick"" finish began to blister and flake off the inside of the pan. After which, of course, the pan immediately began to rust.Unfortuntately, this pan is now out to pasture (in the garage with the rest of the old cookware) and I will have to replace it with a real pan."
3,The handles do it in,I did not notice the accurate picture on the web about the loose handles on this pan. Most roasters have handles fixed in up position for good reason...just try maneuvering these handles in a hot oven!This should be hand washed because the finish and fit is very cheap.
3,Fails to convey the same emotions...,"I am a die-hard Vangelis fan. But I can also acknowledge where his emotions are not as powerful, and ""El Greco"" is one of those cases. The album, while interesting, fails to engage the listener in the same way other classics by the Greek legend do, such as Bladerunner, Antarctica or Opera Sauvage. I recommend those before checking this one out."
2,"""El Greco""-- no thanks!","I have to say that I really expect more from Vangelis. His music has inspired me since I first heard his album, ""Direct,"" when I was eleven years old. Other albums, such as ""Bladerunner"" and ""Oceanic"" have set my standards very high for the quality of Vangelis' work. The dramatic Movement 1 is a good example of what we have all come to expect from Vangelis over the years. After that, the album is sucked into a black hole of redundancy that may cause many listeners to skip through the tracks after listening to about a minute at the beginning of each one. This album is Vangelisesque, yet it lacks the dramatic diversity of his previous works. The album is not suitable for much more than background music at a dinner party. Not many people are going to say, ""Hey, I want to listen to some music. I think I'll put in 'El Greco!'"" Definitely ""Direct."" ""El Greco""-- no thanks."
3,The fifth trend change; and a melodramatic one at best,"Onfortunately, Vangelis, now in his 60's, probably is on the search for a new insight. El Greco is at best in MINOR and a depressive epic in/of Greeces history. Will this be his last one? Hope not. Try some more old boy...you can do it!"
2,Elton Uninspired!!,"Just 3 average songs and the rest us just filler....The best songs here are ""Town of Plenty"" (with The Who s' Pete Townshend on guitar), ""A word in spanish"" and ""Since god invented girls"" (with the Beach Boys on chorus). The only hit from this cd ""I dont want to go on with you like that""...i can not hear it..it is so one dimentional...and unispired... There are many other recordings from this period..i hope they stay in the can if they are as bad as the ones on these cd...this is the result of ""medicine abuse""..."
5,My disappointment turned to joy!!,"I was fortunate to have seen CCEB2 perform this album at the Park West in Chicago, before I purchased the CD. initially, I was upset that Chick had changed the original line-up and then these guys began to play....Wow! This was like if MJ won his first championship and got traded to the friggin' Lakers! Space is one of the most soulful and introspective pieces I've heard in a while and #2 had the whole club jukin' with it's Blues inflected intensity. Miles would be proud of how Chick has carried the torch for pushing the boundaries of Jazz and although this line-up was short-lived, they got the job done!"
3,Not sure.,"This product didn't work as well as I had expected. Still had fleas, but they eventually died off when I began using a natural product with cloves and other herbs."
1,not as advertised,It kills the adult fleas but failed to stop the fleas from coming back in a bedroom.I have used 4 bottles of this and still the fleas return.
5,this product continues to work well.,"Siphotrol plus has been around for many years and where other products have lost their effectiveness, this product continues to work well in flea infested rooms! The price was reasonable and the vendor sent it out in a timely way. Thanks!"
2,A big let-down,"Pages and pages of verbatim interviews with a megalomaniac, even one as twisted as Ted Bundy, get dull after a while. It would be a necessary reference book for anybody writing a doctoral thesis on Bundy or the psychopathic mind, but really holds little interest for the average reader."
2,Not good enough,"My wife purchased this book for research. We had been wanting an accurate and unnabridged dictionary for a time so I felt we could part with the money. Unfortunately for us, 45 words commonly used in the Western US are not even listed. It would have been more informative, more accurate, and far less expensive to look up words in my daughters 4-th grade dictionary. A waste of time, paper, and money. If you really need accurate and COMPLETE research materials pop for Oxford's."
2,vague,"I purchased this dictionary to replace my beloved old Webster's Third, and was less than impressed."
4,I love this album so much!!!!!,"When I first got this album, I wasn't very pleased. I thought that there would be thirteen songs just like Every Morning. I was wrong. The first song is a heavy metal song called New Direction. I was shocked. Then, I listened for a while, and now it's one of my most played CD's. It has it's weird and odd songs like the two New Directions, and a song that I've never had the guts to listen to called Burning Dog, but it also has sweet innocent songs like the new singles Someday, and Falls Apart. Other songs that I like on the album are Aim For Me, Even Though, and Glory isn't bad, either. I think that there is something for almost everyone on this CD (or tape as the case may be.)"
3,OK...but they don't sound the same,"Their fury has subsided. I must say this CD is VERY MELLOW compared to others. Songs like ""Even Though"", ""Falls Apart"", ""Ode to Lonely Hearted"", ""Every Morning"", are GREAT but it seems many fans will miss the louder version of this group. ""Abracadabra"", ""Personal Space Invader"", ""Glory"", were a little louder, right? In any case, we can still learn to see them in a different light since some artists roll with the change. In summary, 14:59 doesn't reflect what this group really is like, but it's a good start for those who want to ease into their music sslooowwly without a broken eardrum."
1,Sugar Ray is a very talented band.,"Their last cd ( Floored ) had acceptionally great songs. If you liked their last cd with the song "" Fly"" then you will enjoy their latest hit "" Every Morning"". The song has a nice beat to it that everyone can get into ( I did ). I recommend this cd to all of you Sugar Ray fans out there! If you liked their last cd then you will love their recent one 14:59!"
2,Blah!!!,The styles of the songs vary widely and only a few share the style of the headliners from this cd...
1,Get some talent before recording songs,These guys are one-hit wonders that seemed to have fooled everybody. I am shocked that people actually bought this album if they happened to listen to the first one.
1,Don't Bite,"If you are a Christmas buyer who is tempted to pick this up based on the song ""Someday"", don't be tempted. Despite the radio play, 11 or 12 songs in Mark McGrath's monotone doesn't hold its appeal for long. I don't know what these guys got for doing this CD, but 20 years behind bars seems about right to me."
4,These guys are no one hit wonders!,"Sugar Ray's latest CD proves that they aren't one hit wonders. Everyone thought ""Fly"" was a good song, and that would be the end of them, but songs such as ""Every Morning"" and ""Someday"" show these guys are here to stay. I love this CD because there is a lot of vareity on it. The intro, ""New Direction"" is like hard-rock material, while ""Ode to the Lonely Hearted"" is slow and relaxing. Then there are plenty of mid-tempo songs too, like ""Falls Apart."" It's a great mixture that even my mom enjoys listening to, so buy it today if you enjoy Third Eye Blind or The Goo Goo Dolls."
1,LAME!!!!,"What the hell happened to music? How these no talent fools are popular should be a Nova episode. This guy has to be THE worst singer ever. He sounds like an American Idol throwaway. PEOPLE, this is not good music, don't be brainwashed by these MTV babies. Sugar Ray, Go Away!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cool C.D!,"Most of the songs were pretty good, but there were a couple of strange ones. They won't keep me from listening to the C.D. though. Great music!"
3,Two Good songs and not much more!,"I figured that since I like two of their songs, the rest would be good, but they weren't. Only 2 good songs, and the rest is weird. I wouldn't recommend this!"
1,there 15 minutes should already be up,what a wack group.they have no talent what so ever.the songs are mtv friendly period.but they are a joke.they are closer to vh1 where are they now? than another 30 minutes.
3,"OK, not for a solid rock fan","I got this cd expecting good songs like ""every morning"", ""Falls Apart"", the best song on the cd, and songs from their last cd like ""fly"". But this one kinda upset me because it's not really rock/alternative all through the album. Sure it offers some good songs but it has songs that are just dumb on it too. Overall it's a 1/4 and a half of a good cd. i don't think you'll like this if u like rock music."
4,Where you at Timbaland?,"I had bought this CD thinking about how much I liked his other CD with Magoo. On this CD he hardly does anything. There's about two songs he actually rapsto and the rest he does the background vocals to. But it is a good CD. It features Jay-z, Nas, Aaliyah, ect...If you're looking for Timbaland buy ""Welcome to Our World"" by Timbaland and Magoo. Much Props to Timbaland!"
3,ITS ALL GOOD,"TIMBALAND CAN'T RAP, BUT HE CAN PRODUCE ONE OF THE FUNKIEST ALBUMS TO COME OUT THIS MONTH. IF YOU LIKE THE WAY HE MAKES BEATS, AND HIS STOP-N-GO RAP STYLE, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM. THE FIRST SINGLE GIVES YOU AN OVERALL VIEW OF WHAT THIS MAN IS ALL ABOUT."
5,A Great Escape by a Great Russian Composer,"Prokofiev had just escaped from the horrors of World War II (the Soviet government sent him to a refuge far from the war front); he had also just escaped from an unhappy marriage (he brought his new girlfriend with him, and they collaborated on the libretto for ""Betrothal in a Monastery""). The result was a brilliantly witty score filled with lyric melody. As expected, this production with Gergiev and the Kirov Opera is satisfyingly authoritative. The cast is excellent and Netrebko is outstanding. The sets are ingenious, the costumes are beautiful, and the commedia dell' arte ballet sequences are gorgeous. Audio quality is loud and clear. I am certain that you will enjoy this 20th-century comic masterpiece, this performance, and this DVD."
4,Cleans well,This laundry soap cleans well. It is unscented (for a reason) but I like the smell of the clothes when there is a little bit of scent lingering. That would be my only complaint. No complaints about getting the clothes clean.
5,Terrific money-saving product,I've really enjoyed using this product. It saves money and gets the clothes just as clean (and softer) than typical laundry detergents.Will def. keep using.
2,So-so,"I have followed the directions and have read the reviews. So I cleaned the washer ahead of time. I use the right amount for the right amount of clothing. But some of the clothes just dont come clean. I have small children and sometimes the clothes get dirty from eating. I have the check every item because the food residue is still there. So I spray them, add some Arm & Hammer and then it comes clean. This wasnt a problem before. I also have a problem with odors. Often after I have gotten the clothes from the dryer, the clothes or blanket/sheet still have the odor on them such as body odors and accidents (urine), so its not that great of a cleaner because I have to inspect everything, spray and add extra detergent/soda to ensure cleanliness. I think I am going just use the rest, and then try making my own from recipes of people who successfully clean their children's clothes and general laundry the first time around."
3,I stopped using it,"I know I am in the minority, but Charlie's left my clothes dry and scratchy, even after washing them close to 20 times. The whites looked really drab and dark as well. I ended up going back to my old Tide and Downy. I wish I could use a green product, but I have to say, this one really didn't work for me."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This was the first time I'd ever tried Charlie's Soap. I purchased it because I wanted something more natural to wash my newborn baby's clothes with. So far, I love it! As soon as I finish off the rest of our Tide, I am planning on washing all of our clothes with Charlie's soap. I don't use any fabric softner anymore and I don't even miss it. Well, I miss that wonderful smell...but the clothes seem just as soft."
4,For us non-cooks,"I'm new to all of this cooking for Diabetes stuff. I've looked on the internet, purchased special cookbooks, etc. The JC Diabetes cookbook is great for people like me, who feel more comfortable working inside a computer than in the kitchen. The recipes are simple and use ingredients that I have heard of and probably have in the kitchen already."
4,Quick delivery,We ordered this sling for our cats since they love sleeping in slings. Our order was processed quickly and arrived when we needed it. The sling is very well made.
1,"starved for production quality, script, and talent",This dismal low-budget film about a woman who gets chained in a basement and starved to death by her date has nothing whatsoever so offer. It's not even worth viewing for kitsch value.
4,excellent rapport quality/price,"I needed some flannel duvet covers since I live in a cold climate during Winter season. The product description was accurate and made it easy to make my selection, the delivery was on time, and the covers were neatly packed. I am very happy with the quality of my purchase and will surely order again from [...]. I have recommended this product to other people, including family members. Thanks again"
4,Surprised at how nice it was for the price,"For fifteen bucks I didn't expect much from this duvet cover, but it is pretty nice. After washing it, it still feels nice, and fits well (in other words no pilling or shrinkage). Other full/queen size duvet covers I've had left about a foot of empty cover on two sides, but this one fits my comforter perfectly. Also, the color is not as pastel as it looks in the picture, which is good as far as I am concerned. Of course it is not exactly a luxury product, but for the price you can't beat it."
3,Bad audio sync on interview,"After having purchased other products from UMG : The Temptations, Smokey & the Miracles and The Supremes, I was jazzed when I purchased The Four Tops. The songs are a well rounded bag of hits from different sources. The problem is in the interview section with Smokey and some other artist, which was so badly out of audio sync and so unwatchable that I returned the dvd and got a refund. I'm assuming my copy was not the only one as someone else here has complained about the same issue. Don't these companys have any sense of product quality? Too bad I really wanted to have this for my collection, but I'll wait till it hits the bargain bins or the audio sync issue is corrected.Times are tough, money is tight, so please don't put out a product like this, its an insult to us as fans and most of all to the late and great artists."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am a fan of The Band and have several Mobile Fidelity remasters, so I was looking forward to what I hoped would finally be a decent sounding CD from the group. In short, the sound is awful. Awful to the point of being unlistenable. Though there is something of a sense of depth and soundstage to the CD, the sound is so harsh and strident that there is no pleasure in listening to it. Don't waste your time and money. I can't believe that Mobile Fidelity put out an SACD of such poor quality."
3,Big Pink Review,"This is a great compilation of some important material from The Band. That being said, it sounds a little more dated than I would have expected from such an iconic group."
2,Not too good,"I really wanted to like this CD because I'm a big fan of Robbie Robertson but I just couldn't. The music is too dated. I bought this CD because I had a flash of nostalgia for The Band. Big mistake. I doubt that I'll ever listen to this again. It's not that it's horrible. It's just really dated, in a bad way, not a good ""evokes the era"" sort of way. Spend your money on something else, like Rocky Votolato or Amos Lee."
5,anything less than 5 stars is unthinkable,"This album is best known for ""The Weight"". The organ intro to ""Chest Fever"" will floor you.Each song is like a little story.I don't have a life-changing-related story about this album, I just want to say that among everything else that came out of 1968,this is great music. I absolutely recommend."
2,What you see is not what you get.,"I ordered this poster hoping I'd get the exact same image just as it was shown. But, i didn't. The guy on fire standing on the right has a completely different face and hair. This is called falls advertisement. I wanted the original version like it was shown here and not another version."
1,shocked at the language!,"I've heard good things about this series, so I didn't worry too much when my kindergarten & preschool boys picked up this book and said they wanted me to read it out loud. But I had to edit it! Here are some quotes:""hey! shut up your face!""""Grampa frank miller is a sucker, I think.""also there is a drawing of her climbing on top the refrigerator and she is only mildly reprimanded for any of these things, like ""not today please!"" or ""you know the rules"" And I only read the first chapter.This is not a book for elementary kids, definitely not for anyone who is not clear on right and wrong or good manners yet. Sorry, I was really disappointed, we'll be getting rid of this one."
3,war games dead code,Too much like the original movie 25 years ago. I prefer the actors in the older movie.
1,They lost this War Game,"I watched this, and made it all the way through, although I was counting the minutes. It was so bad. It tried to be cleaver and build on the firat movie, but as each minute went by it bacame more and more unbelieveable. I think the writers sould stick to doing scripts for B rated cartoons. The acting wasn't so bad, but then nothing redeems an extremely poor story line. Do NOT waste your time, much less any money on this one."
3,Well it was fun,I wasn't sure what to expect whern the DVD arrived but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was quite good fun and wasn't boring. It was good. I did notice by the end of the movie that it share a little similarity with the movie Eagle Eye I did not let that get in the way of my enjoyment of the film. I think this film help up well on its own merits.For one I wasn't bored. I was kept interested throughout the whole movie watching what Ripley would do next. The opening scene for instance with the terrorists was quite good. That scene alone got my attention. The rest of the movie then followed.it was nice to see things from the original Wargames in this like the WOPR computer and Dr. Falken so that kept my interest too.Overall 3/5 and a definite repeat viewing or two later on.
2,Good but Lacking on Service,Nice beginners book on all you ever wanted to know.3D glasses were not in shipping package.Access to the Teaching Tutorial provided in text with ID number could not beaccessed by reader. Online help was not in any way useful.
5,A Few Words... Of Warning? Of Enthusiasm?,"I am both driven to warn people about this movie, and to be enthusiastic about it. Definetly not for the faint of heart, it is terribly disturbing. I watched the film with my best friend and we both kept staring at eachother in amazement, which could be a true sign of how masterful the piece is. Great characters and story line. If you think you can handle the psychological implications and chilling plot of this movie, then go for it!"
4,"Not bad... but not ""Heavenly""","The performances of Renee Humphrey and especially the amazing Alica Witt are the main reason to watch this movie. However, yes, it IS a whole lot like Heavenly Creatures, which was much more powerful in the writing and directing categories. The ending was especially odd and contrived."
1,Does not fit play yard,I purchased this because it was suggested to go with the play yard but it does not fit. You can only purchase the 2ft extensions to go with the play yard.
1,Only worth it in the starter kit.,"Got this in the starter kit and it sheds leaving single strands in my makeup compact, blushes and allover my face and clothes. Not really worth purchasing. It works OKAY but not great as it is poorly made."
4,Great Brush - but arrived broken,"I love these brushes and have been using this one with my Bare Minerals makeup for years now. However, this particular one was shipped to me and immediately upon removing from the packaging the black handle slid right out of the metal section. I'm not sure if this happened during transit or what but very disappointing! I have attempted to hot glue it back together and so far it's holding. However, i have not used it yet so we'll see if it holds up. Love the brush, but it's not very useful without a handle."
1,Hated it!,Before buying this I purchased the same one in the store. It was a great brush and I was sad when I lost it. It was so expensive in the store and cheaper on amazon. But the one I purchased from amazon is nothing like the one from the store. It fell apart so easily and was very hard on my skin.
5,Great book for young teens,"This book uses humor, lively graphics and straightforward language to teach kids about stress and how to deal with it. It offers concrete ways to identify and then lessen stress in their lives. I highly recommend it for any young adult."
4,"Review for Remo Ambassador Coated Bass Drum Head - 22""","My drumset instructor recommended I use this as my resonant head for a better sounding bass drum in the jazz idiom, so this is generally what I use it for. It sounds best to me when tuned high and tight.However, I read John Henry Bohnam used this head as well for his bass drum; so I'm gonna' go out on a limb here and say that it can also be used for other styles of music as well. Deciding which head to purchase solely depends on what kind of sound you want. If you want a ""fat"" low pitched sound for instance,a pinstripe ebony works well. But if you want a bright ""punchy"" sound, then this head will suffice. The standard batter head is the powerstroke 3 (which is a good head to start with); but once you've developed an ear for it, i supposed you can begin to deviate from that as well."
5,Dog lovers world over will love this book!,"Ninety-Nine Newfies by Pat Seawell is a delightful book for all Newfie lovers, as well as all dog lovers. You will have a smile on your face, or tears in your eyes, as you share these wonderful stories. This is a book that will be enjoyed for a long time. No matter what kind of dog you love you will see him in many of the shared stories. Your Newfie will enjoy hearing the stories, too."
1,hmm..keith sweat did this album,first off..im a huge Keith Sweat fan..HUGE!...but this album..track by track was wack..total waste of cash...and never..never ever gets any play...nuff said
5,Wonderful.,I've had these for around two years now and they've held up quite well. Having all my sockets in order and easy to access is great. Highly recommended.
4,Cool light,"This is a durable little light. Outshines my non-LED flashlights and is the perfect size. Not too big and not too small.Learning the ""modes"" takes a few tries, but I learned them quickly. Fellow campers were jealous of my purchase!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Maglite was a great flashlight until they made this model. I needed a new mini mag for work(i have used maglites since they came out) so i ordered this new model sp2209h mini LED,I already have maglite mini Led for years and wanted a new one.The new one has features I don't need or want and worked intermittently. I use a flashlight everyday for work and need one that works all the time so i returned it. Very disappointed I hope Maglite get their act back together"
1,Led Mini Maglite,"Well I just received my camo flashlight today I was very excited because I had spent my money in america and I had the incandescent flashlight which is prety good.When I opened the package I was eager to see what it was like then put the batteries in, and nothing happened, then put some other new batteries nothing happened, so I called the warranty number and they told me to send it in, I hope they can fix it but so far not very dependable, a little dissapointing, but I still want to see how good they are Ill just have to wait a little longer."
4,mag light,A great light that I would definitely recommend. I had a defective unit but repaired it myself. It's a great light.
3,spot mode ok flood mode dissapointing,Perhaps this is typical of led bulbs but in flood mode the center of the beam is black. No good for reading.
5,An excellent film on the aftermath of juvenile violence.,This film focuses on a seventeen year old gang member sentenced to live with a family that has lost their son to violent crime. The government program is fictitious but it could be real. I loved this film! It's different from most of the Hollywood trash out there!
4,a visual feast,"This movie is a visual feast. I was captivated by the brilliant imageries of land, the seasons, and the people &#65533; the rhythmic of every day living in this exotic land. The director used this setting to reveal the life of the three sisters that unfold softly, smartly, like a poem."
2,Vietnamese chick flick,"After the first fifteen minutes, I was bored with these stories of three sisters. Maybe beautifully filmed, but that doesn't make it a good movie."
1,Horrible sound quality!!,"Don't misinterpret this review. Depeche Mode is one of my favorite bands, and these songs are absolutely awesome. However, the mastering on this CD is atrocious. ALL the songs are compressed and clipped, ruining the dynamics of each song. If you take a look at the waveforms of the tracks, you'll see what I mean. It sounds TOO loud and distorted.Do yourself a favor and find yourself the earlier Singles: 81-85 compilation or Catching Up with Depeche Mode if you live in the States ( although you'll be missing Get the Balance Right, People Are People, and Leave in Silence, but those can be found on the People Are People compilation album ).This also goes for the mastering on the 86-98 compilation."
2,Too many cheezy tracks on this album,"Ugh! I am a fan of later Depeche Mode work but they're early stuff is really bad! They're albums don't get good until you reach Black Celebration (which came out in 1986) which is perfect because all of the [bad] Depeche Mode singles are kept in this CD leaving only the cool ones for the 1986-1998 singles CD (a must buy!). Most of the tracks on this CD are just horrid. You feel embarressed just listening to them much less owning the CD. But, the album does have a few good tracks. People are People is pretty good but sounds a bit cheezy by today's standards. The two gems in this album are Blasphemous Rumours and Shake the Disease which are both awesome songs. Unfortunately, the other 14 tracks are really [bad]."
4,Enjoyed it,"This was my first Trollope novel and I don't understand why he isn't more popular. I enjoyed it, it is an easy read and it kept me wanting to know what happens next."
3,good but long,I really do like the book but I think it would be better if it had been divided up into a series. I love the charactor of Alice. Got a little bored in some places where the discriptions got drawn out. Probably will not read again because of the length.
1,Can you forgive her,"This particular Bibliolife printing of Can You Forgive Her was sleazy - crummy paper, weird choice of a too bold type face for the body text, and a hard cover that made it look like a high school textbook and not a classic piece of literature. It was definitely no bargain at the $39.18 that it cost."
5,Great bow for the price!,"I bought the 30# model, and it's a great shooter.Pros:The riser comes pre-drilled for a quiver, stabilizer on the front and a plunger.Since the limbs are removable, the weight of the pull can be adjusted up or down with a new set of limbs.The $100 price tag for a new bow makes it one of the least expensive bows out there.Cons:Good deal of hand shock. The bow rattles my teeth after releasing, but I'm sure some string silencers will help out a great deal.Final evaluation:For the price, probably the best shooting bow out there. You can shoot it all day and not get tired, making it a perfect bow for anyone looking to work on form or wanting to have fun with the kids."
2,"A nice story, but doesn't merit a whole book.","This is a nice short story, but it doesn't stand alone as a book. I found the story predictable and sentimental, but still enjoyable enough to read. It's worth spending the hour or so it takes to read it, but I'm glad I just borrowed it from the library."
2,Sentimental and contrived.,"Set in Salt Lake City, a family with young children moves into a quaint Victorian home to assist an elderly widow. The widow revels in the family's young children and their close bonds. The widow and family come to love and care for each other and the husband discovers an old Christmas box in the attic that holds the sad secrets of the widow's life.Nice story and short. But not short enough."
5,Take an hour out of your busy life!!!,"The Christmas Box made me cry. I did it and I am glad. I am glad because with the commercialism of Christmas bombarding me, the difficulty of reminding the kids what it is really about and running around like a chicken with her head cut of, I too need reminding that it is the birth of Christ. God so loved his children that he sent baby Jesus to lead us back to him. A great book and the trilogy would be a welcome gift."
4,A must read for all parents!!,"I heard about this book from a co-worker and am glad that I took the time to read it. It is a definite must read for all parents, especially the hard working father. It teaches a lesson that we all tend to forget in today's world and reminds you of what is TRULY important in your life."
3,Too sweet,"I read The Christmas Box by Richard Paul Evans yesterday afternoon. The best thing about it was that it was short. I feel a little like Elaine from Seinfeld when she hated the highly acclaimed ""English Patient"".There must be something wrong with me. That's the only explanation, right?Don't get me wrong. It's a sweet story. A sad story and a good reminder of what is really, truly important--especially at Christmas. I get the message. I gave my babies extra hugs last night.So, maybe my real problem with the book is actually the length. There wasn't time to develop any of the characters very well. I don't care about them yet. It's hard to be too emotionally moved by a story if you just don't care about them."
3,How odd...,"I've looked at ""The Mummy"" dvd over 50 times and then got the book. I was dissapointed with it's content. It looks like the story in the book wasen't from the OFFICIAL script, but an old script they had. On the dvd we see scenes cut out of the movie and in this book they were in there. I got lost from times to times since there were dialogues from actors that weren't even in the movie itself. I know - I'm an obsessed mummy fan."
5,A good overview on philosophy of mind,"a useful and interdisciplinary overview on the themes of perception. Very for its philosophical clarity and for the ability to deal with themes in neurosciences, a great book"
5,Love this,"as a young'n lookin' for hip hop, i only listened to Fugees and 2Pac cus those were the only 1s i knew at the time, then Busta Came with ""Gimme Some More"" i bought this album, and the others. i love this album so much. i still listen to busta, love all hes stuff."
5,Busta Buss got skills!!!,"This new album from busta Rhymes is his most creative one yet. The thing about busta that makes him so tight in is flow is the way he brings it to you and the beats he uses. This album is all that and might look crazy, but is more concious about the future than any other hip/hop record out there. Even Wu-tang! He brought Janet Jackson,Mystical, and ozzy osborn along this time as guests, as well as the Flipmode Squad. It could have done without mystical, but since busta keeps it tight it's alright. The song with janet is the best collaboration out of the three artists on here. They really worked on this one. Give this album a try and trust me Fans and Non-Fans of busta won't be disssapointed at all. Busta keeps you in full check with beats while not forgeting what times we are in, keeping it even more real. Check this album out Now!!!!You won't regret!!"
1,This album has got to go,"This album truly proves busta can't hang with the big boys. His lyrics are fast, and very noisy. I can't stand this damn alum."
2,"Strong, Crazy and once again loud....",Busta Rhymes strikes again. He keeps on spitting out his punchlines in his own way. Very energetic but it's not very good. The bright-spot of this album is his song with Ozzy.
5,Busta's futuristic sounds mix with hip-hop flava is da bomb!,Busta's album is very 2000 type. It moves you and makes you feel energtic. The rhymes are funky with a twist of Flimpmod flava and it has some R&B flows as well. The album is da bomb especially for the brothaz that love hip-hop! Go Busta!
5,"Great Rhymes, Great Beats, Great Everything.","Busta Rhymes once again proves that he has the skills and talent to turn doubters into listeners with his newest CD, E.L.E.. This is one of the best hip-hop CD's you can listen to because of the hot lyrics and the blazing beats go so well together. Busta Rhymes and Janet Jackson has a great duet on the CD's best track ""What's it Gonna Be"". Also, the Flipmode Squad tear it up on ""Against All Odds"". If you like uniqueness in hip-hop, I recommend Extinction Level Event. With his other efforts, The Coming, When Disaster Strikes, The Imperial, and E.L.E., Busta Rhymes proves that he never fails to dissappoint."
5,GIVE EM SOME MO!,"BUSTA IS DEFINENTLY ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED ARTIST EVER. HIS STYLE IS SO RAW AND UNIQUE. ALL OF BUSTAS BEATS ARE OFF THE HOOK (INCLUDING THE IMPERIAL FLIP MODE SQUAD) ANYTHING WITH BUSTAS SKILLS INVOLVED IS AUTOMATIC SUCCESS. BUSTA IS ALSO A TIGHT REGGAE ARTIST HE DID A COUPLE OF SONS WITH BUJU BANTON AND THEIR SLAMMIN, WELL ENOUGH SAID. BOSTON LIVE 99 TILL 2000......"
2,Bad content; amazing talent,"As I am a Christian, I cannot stand the things Busta Rhymes sings about. But after listening to ""Gimme Some More"" I was absolutely floored by Busta's speed and clarity in his raps. The sample for that song is also an amazing contrast to the lightning-fast raps. Content-wise, however, I definetly DO NOT agree with the cursing and lude subjects. God's peace, Jon :o)"
2,Not his finest,"E.L.E. is a very dark album, and honestly, I bought it for 2 songs, ""Gimme some mo"", and ""What's it gonnabe"". I can't really get into anything else other than those songs. As a matter of fact only a few songs in my opinion showcases his rap talent. Everything is is ordinary, nothing to praise him for. I can give his producers props though, none of his beats lack."
4,E.L.E,To make this short and simp pretty throwed lil album. Bass line beats fo yo trunk and some ride and puff trackz. Pick this up folk.
3,"Some tight shit, some bad shit.","Busta's third cd is hot, cept for some tracks which just suck. The tracks ""Gimme Some More"" and ""Wildin wit us?..."" f/ Mystikal are probably the tightest on the cd, but songs like ""Just Give it to me Raw"" and ""Take it off"" are slow and un-Busta, but it's worth the $13. Peace."
3,"Warm and pretty, but...","This blanket, although thinner than I had expected is toasty warm. However, the side edges are unfinished. I find that just irritates me. I have washed and dried the blanket twice on the day I received it to see if the unfinished edges would be a problem. They're not. Nor did the blanket shrink. I'll be keeping the blanket, but darned if those unfinished edges aren't still bothering me (and no, I'm not old)!"
4,its okay,"Benefits:relatively unobtrusive light/fan combo for my high end bathroom.Problems:uses odd bulbs that are not standard (4 pin base called gx24q, 14watt cfl)congtractor turned on the fan during some particularly heavy construction dust and now one of two units light wont turn on."
4,Quick Step,"I dance Quick Step - this CD is not exactly MY choice in music, but it was priced very reasonable and it is good practice music - the beat is steady and is right where it should be."
1,never liked this song,"loved ice cube, loved wsc, lench mob, nwa all the deathrow chit but this song never got to me for some reason."
4,Criminology,"A text book, but interesting. Class over all was enlightening. Would I do it again, No probably not if I did not have to"
1,Great for Math PhD's but Useless for Everyone Else,"This book assumes that the reader already has a Ph.D. in math. As a student, this book fails to do a good job explaining the material covered and makes too many assumptions about what the reader knows."
5,Intelligent and Riveting,"This collection of novels is a beautiful and intellgently written volume, one that is an interesting read. If one wants comparisons, it could be compared to Garcia Marquez's style--very dense, very descriptive, very mysterious. There are copies of it available used... Buy it!"
3,Obvious bias against Napoleon,"Blundering to Glory is intended to be an account of how Napoleon got lucky as a general and emperor. While there are numerous events where Napoleon was lucky or his marshals saved him from himself, there were times that Napoleon's abilities were apparent. Connelly unnecessarily bashes Napoleon throughout his book while overemphasizing his marshals' accomplishments.Blundering to Glory is well written if the reader understands the bias Connelly shows against Napoleon. The information included on his battles and empire is informative making Blundering to Glory a good companion to other Napoleon books such as Horne's How Far From Austerlitz, Elting's Swords Around a Throne and Schom's Napoleon."
4,Instant Gratification,"I hadn't listened to Chick Corea in decades and decided to give him another try. As soon as this CD began playing, I knew I had made the right decision. From the very first notes, I realized I was in fusion heaven. This is a magnificent group of high caliber musicians playing top notch jazz/rock fusion and the music is as good as anyone could desire. I found this following the path of Dave Weckl who is a superb drummer. Chick has had so many groups during his long career and this was his ""electrik"" era throwing together Frank Gambale (guitar) Dave Weckl (drums) Eric Marienthal (sax) and John Patitucci (bass). I would put this up against anything Weather Report, Crusaders, Yellow Jackets or Spyro Gyra were doing in the fusion arena. Well written and very well played, Beneath The Mask is a winner. Hey, everyone has an opinion and a hole to put it in! - Ciao"
1,Does not give rationale for case studies,This book would have been good except it doesn't give the rationale for the case studies. When there are not any correct answers how do I know what I came up with is correct!
4,50/50,"I say 50/50 because only half of this single is good. The title track is obviously good, but the second track by Jory whatever kind of blows. I reccomend the other How Do I Deal single that has two versions of the above song."
1,How do I deal with this excuse for a song?,"HA! I would only listen to this tripe if I needed a good laugh. Jennifer, keep your day job. I don't know how anyone could listen to this paint-by-numbers song without cringing...I mean, right down to the cheezy guitar 'solo' in the middle. Man, her music would promptly sink into oblivion if it weren't for her movies. Too bad some record company threw out a heap of money on slick production hoping to cash in on sudden superstardom. If you do buy this disc, file it next to the brand new Kathie Lee disc you'll wind up buying. P-U."
5,Wonderful stories,"Herge's creation of Tintin is truly a marvel, and these adventures in this book have suspense, along with jokes. There is a bit of Spanish, in Prisoners of the Sun, and all the scenes are THE BEST."
4,Where's the Unicorn?,'Red Rackham's Treasure' is a continuation of 'The Secret of the Unicorn' which I guess is part of another 3 in 1 small book series. The other two books - Crystal and Sun are amazing adventures taking you deep into the Inca territory. A must have!
2,VERY HARD TO READ,"The print was very small and not black...I think it was light red, maybe? My son is 9 and he wouldn't even try to read it. He found the type so confusing that I returned the book. I see that alot of kids liked the book but they seem older than my son. Consider the age of your child and the size of the print that your child usually reads from before buying this book. The type size is very small...very close together...and light in color. It was confusing to my child."
4,Strong Enough to rock the world,"The first time I heard Cher's powerful wall-piercing vocal STRONG ENOUGH on the radio, I told myself I'm going to miss the 70s goodness of disco and gayness if I don't dump my then heartbreaking relationship and move on with my life...DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE? Yes, for the sake of survivors, Cher will always be a grand guidance figure to shelter us from the cruelty of love when it leaves you bleeding.Despite of a few critically too cliche-sounding disco tracks, I gave 4 stars to the bold release of this record and insist ""this is the (curing) album for the lonely"" and hurt.P/S: The CD sleeve printing is a platinum pearl-like silverish blue which adds the disco feel to this album. I actually bought it twice for an original German copy to replace the ""duller"" local edition in my country Malaysia."
1,Why only one star? Read the following!,"I LOVED the song beleive. It was cool, her voice was wonderful, and the song was too. I almost bought the cd a few minuets ago, but then, horrifyed, I realized the rest of the songs on the whole album were sh*t! It's just not fair. It's not the sixties anymore. Enough with the disco! I think I might by the single but the cd's other songs are tooooooooo crappy to ever be worth their cost! Cher dident even write beleive at all. She's really phoney I think and it makes me sad cus i loved the song. Maybe someone should write all her songs, because, as I've discovered, she is just not talented at writing songs. Oh, and for those of you who don't know, It's ""Life after Love"" not love after love."
5,Cher is ridden with sensual energy,Oh how can you complain? Cher is the tonic of fantasy and earth that her fans crave. Only problem is that the material is sometimes less than the artist! She towers over and masters the mediocre!! A winner in life this taurean preveils!
5,ANOTHER GREAT CHER CD,"I was hesitant to get this CD based on the tepid reviews I read at this site about 2 months ago; however, I just LOVE the song BELIEVE, and I loved her last 2 albums ... Needless to say, Cher did not disappoint! It is excellent, and I wait with bated breath for the remix Cher and Madonna are recording of(track #7) Dov'e L'Amore. It's so difficult to pick a favorite on this CD! Way to go Cher! Thanks for another great CD."
3,Absolutely FUN!,"What Cher may lack in voice quality and range is compensated for in the production of this cd. Cher's distinctive voice coupled with the fun, discoesque feel of the music and it's slick production make this a cd worth adding to your collection. Most of the songs are easy to listen to. The disco flavor of all the songs is a tad repetitious but not abrasive. The omission of the last two tracks, ""Love is the Groove"" and ""We All Sleep Alone"", before release of this cd would have made ""Believe"" perfect. All the other tracks make a cd of seamless fun and energy!"
4,It's a guilty pleasure.,"I'm ashamed to admit it but I do like Cher's super 70's, unbeilavably out dated cd. Believe is good and when I'm all by myself and I'm 110% sure no one is around I dance to it."
4,A great comeback,"At last a dance album that has intelligent lyrics for a change, unlike a lot of songs these days (Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs"", for one). She has a strong powerful voice that doesn't get drowned out by the music. ""Believe"" was the first song that I had heard that used the vocoder, and unfortunately, now it seems that every artist and their brother are using it. I used to like it, I still do, but it can get a bit annoying after hearing it too often. But I really like this album, it's upbeat, and if it doesn't make you feel like dancing, then nothing will."
5,"Super-cheesy yesterday, infectious today!","Wow, this CD really reminds me of a waitress I worked with in the seventies. Rosie, if you're ou there, call me! Being musically adventurous, I purchased Cher's CD based on Amazon reviews and music samples. Yesterday, I thought it was really cheesy, today it has grown on me. I love the digital manipulation of her voice on the first cut, BELIEVE. It works really well with her distinctive voice! And the fifth cut, STRONG ENOUGH is pure Donna Summer circa 1977. Production sounds like a cross between Giorgio Moroder and William Orbit. Occasionally, she veers a little too close to Madonna`s RAY OF LIGHT. At first listen, Cher sounds reluctant to sing this material, but I wouldn't be surpised if this CD outsells anyone's expectations. Cher is like a cat with nine lives. This CD is going to make a great gift for my Uncle Debbie!"
1,BAD!,"I can't believe this is the same woman who sang ""Gypsies, tramps and thieves"" and ""Jesse James"" when I was younger... that's all I can say. Dance/pop stuff is not for Cher. I thought she had more class than that."
1,"""I BELIEVE"" CHER SHOULD RETIRE AFTER THIS ALBUM!","Between the facelift, clothes, and the music style, Cher is competiting with Brittany Spears for the worst album of the Millenium. Her voice is annoying and the song is redundant to say the least. What is up with that yodelling???"
1,This got old fast,"Two days ago I bought this album because of ""Believe."" At first I liked that song as well as ""Strong Enough"" and ""Dov'è L'amore."" Now all of those songs have gotten old and there aren't any other songs worth listening to. I have CD's that I've had for a longer period of time and they still haven't gotten old. Overall, I was extremely disappointed. I will be selling this album tomorrow."
1,CHER KILLS THE DANCE MUSIC SCENE WITH THIS ALBUM.,"Cher dies on delivery with this CD. ""Believe"" the first single off the album is the only catcy tune, the rest of the CD just falls apart, especially the second single ""Strong Enough"" should be retitled ""Weak Enough"", as for the rest of the album it sounds like one big giant single- all the songs sound the same. The worst cut ""Taxi Taxi"" a disco warped disaster. Bring back Donna Summer anytime, and Cher go back to what you do best ""rock"". Remember ""Skin Deep"", ""Jesse James"", etc. Give this dance techno a TOTAL miss."
2,Cher's trying way too hard,I was not all that impressed with Cher's new album. I think she's trying to fit in with music these days and if she continues it may get to the point of being a sell-out. If anyone buys the album I guess I can say two tracks to listen to are Believe and Strong Enough.
5,Get up & get you going type beat,"Cher has never sounded better. Not being a fan of her in any way, this CD has captured my attention I love the up tempo beat. I am glad to see that she is making a nice come back at the age of 50. Good for her!"
1,The music sounds like a porno movie soundtrack,"Although she has never claimed to have a great voice, Cher always had catchy songs that were sort of tongue in cheek, but she wasn't always aware, which made it even better. This music however sounds like the background music in a porno movie and her voice sounds strained and overproduced. Please buy ""It's a Man's World"" if you want the real Cher."
5,OH CHILD...I BELIEVE!,"WOW. Who cares about Cher's age-she can do whatever she wants! This album is hot(even after almost 2 years). I bought it the day it came out-the record store had one copy(hello), anyway when I started listening...I was BLOWN away. I was so into it that I think I broke a bone. ""Strong Enough"" was a revalation. Total disco. ""Believe""(the song) is great but the whole CD is...so fantastic. ""Takin' Back My Heart"" is a sexy Cher walking down the street, looking fierce telling every to get outta her way. And ""All or Nothing""(which sounds very similiar to it the ""in""famous ""Believe"") is so rocking that I have had to replace my roof. ""Runaway"" is a Cher classic. The album-along with Madonna ultra cool ""Ray of Light"" spawned this whole dance revial-that I personally enjoy. The album rocks and IS SURE to be a classic-it is totally Cher raising the roof in only a way that most can only dream of..."
3,An OK album,"I bought this on a whim a few years ago, as I had some friends who owned it and said it was really danceable. I needed some new music, so I bought it and listened to it. I have very mixed feelings about this album. I can easily skip through the title track, as I have heard that song one too many times in my life. The Power is also a waste of space on the album. Strong Enough, however, is phenomenal and catchy as hell. After hearing it one or two times I was singing it everywhere. All Or Nothing is yet another powerful track. Taxi Taxi is pretty good as well. Why they included We All Sleep Alone (even if it is a dance version) again is beyond me. There are only 10 songs on this album (and only 9 new ones), and the voice enhancing gets carried away in some of these songs. This album definately isn't going to be around forever, but it did give people some perks while it was out."
2,"CHER IS GOOD TO DANCE BY, BUT WEARS THIN FAST.","Chers new album ""Believe"" is relatively good for dance music if you are at a studio, but to listen to in the car or at home tends to wear thin fast. The breakout hits ""All or Nothing"", and ""Runaway"" are breakouts because they sound just like ""Believe"", then there is ""Strong Enough"", which is very cheesy at best trying to intimidate Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive"". The album is a tired state of affairs."
5,"""STRONG ENOUGH"" ???","Cher certainly has proved that she is indeed Strong Enough, love how she has gained attention all over the world with this fun danceable album!!"
5,I LOVE CHER,"I really like Cher. I didn't like her until I heard her song ""Believe"" It is sooooooo cool! I listen to it all the time. It is so neat!"
5,vellux balnket,Great blanket exactly waht was stated in the info was exactly what was received...Great item!!
5,Public speaking,"I took Mr. Montgomery's three-day speech course in 1974. It was the best skills course I have ever taken. He indicated at that time that he had reviewed over 300,000 speeches for organizations such as Xerox and the American Mangement Association. His course helped change my life for the better."
4,The search for accuracy never stops.,"The book contains a series of articles published in Precision Shooting on how to improve the accuracy of an M1 Garand.If you're looking for a book explaining in great detail how to improve accuracy look further, but if you need a place to start your search for accuracy this book can help. It gives some very clever low cost tips before you can switch tot the more serious measures like glassbedding the action and stock.Most information on the Net is on sexier glassbedding, but the simple use of a rubber band to eliminate horizontal play in the sights is much cleverer in my opinion.As this is an American book all size etc aren't metric so being European you'll need to convert everything back to mm's and cm's but that doesn't change the value of the book.On the whole a very readable book and money well spent."
4,Solid introduction to accurizing a Garand,"This book has some good tips on accurizing a Garand, and many of them are at a level that an average person can do as opposed to requiring a gunsmith. One thing that maybe the description doesn't make totally clear: this book is entirely about hardware modifications you can do to your Garand. There is no content on shooting technique or other 'software' matters."
1,Makes Blair Witch 2 look good!,"This film is maybe the worst film i've ever seen. The actors are absolute nobodies and the director is so cheap he uses the girl and the two guys who get killed in the movie later on in the film as a nurse, docter and detective. Oh and by the way you horror freaks the whole KILLER-IN-THE-WOODS cliche was completely ruined when Blair Witch 1&2 came out so please let the stupid idea at rest if any of you decide to make a horror film someday!"
5,Delicious!,Must try this ones. I just cant stop eating them.. Just BEAUTIFUL the feeling inside your mouth. Will start buying in bulk
5,lychee candy,I bought this candy as a gift.It was a big hit with the grand-kids and they enjoyed it a lot.
4,A well organized book full of helpful tips and guidelines,"I would not say this is the difinitive ""kitchen garden book."" But it does have a plethora of information. While many gardening books give examples of vegetable plots, this is the first one that photographs the site and then numbers all the plants. It makes it very clear which plant is which instead of having to guess. The book is organized in a straightforward manner from the planning to harvest. Their reference section is extremely comprehensive. One of the sections that I found particularly easy to read is the Plant Selection Guide for both herbs and vegetables. All of the plants are lined up with their basic planting requirements: planting depth, sun/partial sun, zones, etc. There is an interesting array of receipts that I will have to try...""Pear, Watercresss, and Lentil Salad"" and ""Root Vegetable and Apple Stew."" Overall, this is a solid vegetable gardening book with loads of advice especially on herbs."
5,Unique!,"I was listening to Mark and Brian on the radio and heard about this self-published book. I went to Amazon.com and ordered it. I was in the middle of reading one of my usual big-name-author novels when Happy Birthday MR. Sidney (HBMS) arrived in the mail. I ended up abandoning the other book until I finished reading HBMS. I'm a combat veteran, this book helped me see parts of myself that I probably need to work on. And I think many, perhaps most, people who are fortunate enough to read this book will see themselves in one or more of the charactors. I've already begun to make changes in my behavior as a result of reading this well written book."
3,It's not about HER,"While I love Betsy Lerner's nonfiction (y'all should pick it up, especially a piece about eating . . .), in this book she is mostly just about HER, and her saying how much she loves writers and reading their work, and then describing different types of writers . . . well, let's just say that she's sort of copying (but I don't think she realizes it) what John Gardner did WAY BETTER in ""On Becoming a Novelist."" So, save yourself some time and go pick that CLASSIC up. This will just make you feel warm and fuzzy, but the Gardner book is funny, tough, and inspiring all in one package. They don't make 'em like that anymore."
1,novice 73,I bought this product to use at my son's high school graduation party.On the second pass the blue horseshoe hit the steel pin and broke in half. That ended the horseshoe game for the rest of the day. I would not buy this product again! It must have been that great steel Made in CHINA.
1,Broke Shoe on the very first game.,Just got me a new horseshoe set from Amazon today!! Figured I would get outside and get some exercise. First game with son and broke a horseshoe!! Geez!!
3,Not your usual horseshoe,"I suppose there is nothing wrong with these horseshoes but they are not in the typical style. The edges of the entire shoe are rounded as opposed to the typical ""square"" edges. I found them difficult to adapt to, personally."
4,A must have for any punk rocker's collection,This cd ROCKS! What makes this album so killer is thier energy combined with a great beat.
5,Kick ass cd,"thid cd is great music and very good everything pretty much. I love it! I heard freak of the week so i bought it off amazon and it rocks . BUY IT, OKAY? IT's worth the dough. trust me."
2,dissapointing,"I like Isan. Lucky Cat and Clockwork are great albums. When I heard Isan were incorporating new instruments into Meet Next Life and trying to expand their sound I was a little excited, a tad nervous. So they got a guitar and a a glockenspiel (which is REALLY making a comback now) to add texture to their tunes. Aside from ""birds over barges"" which works well, the rest of the album is a pretty dull affair. Lucky Cat was a really emotive piece of electronica while Clockwork illustrated some of their more quirky works which are quiet engaging. Meet Next Life though has nothing on these two albums. It's a really nice record...which is precisely the problem."
4,Works for me,"I got this for a very old S&W 5906 with square trigger guard and it is one of the few holsters that have fit. I would have given it four stars if it had come with the MOLLE attachment, or standard belt loop attachment instead of paddle only (see Blackhawk serpa holster system, which are a bit more versatile). There is a separate MOLLE attachment for the Roto holsters. Overall a good holster that fit my needs."
5,SPUNKY!!,I loved this song. I bought Bath House Betty and discovered it. It's full of energy and can lift you out of a down mood.
3,Decent yes. Essential... maybe not.,"I'll keep this short and to the point. I love Bernstein and his music. I don't care for some of the takes on his music by the City of Prague Philharmonic. It's at their discretion to find their own interpretation of his thematic material, but these interpretations are just not that impressive to me. Also, I am not fond of the recording of the material. Something about the sound of this recording comes across as phoned-in, and somewhat cheap. If you can find a copy, ""Elmer Bernstein by Elmer Bernstein"" with the man himself conducting the Royal Philharmonic is MUCH better. The problem is, it's difficult to locate (only one copy available on Amazon at the time I write this), and it's far from a complete sampling of his film scores and themes."
4,Not complete - disappointed,"Although the main body of work is there, played by an amazing orchestra, it is not complete in that National Geographic, Stripes, and a few others weren't included. They are as popular as any track on the CD. It would only have added a few more minutes but it would be more complete by my standards. Otherwise, love it."
4,Great for Dogs,"This product is great for wiping your dogs paws in the winter without them getting dry/cracked. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that it is not easy to remove. The container has an opening at the top by, the way the wipes are wound, you have to open the top and tear them off one at a time.Great product, bad packaging."
1,Terrible,"Simply terrible, I was able to use only one pen of the 4 that came in the pack. All the others clogged and would not work within a few days of use. Never buying Bic again."
5,Surprisingly excellent!,"I have to admit to not having tried a BIC pen for more than 20+ years. I think I got turned off with the stix pen way back when. I have been a dedicated fountain pen user and seldom use a roller,gel or ballpoint pen unless absolutely necessary.The one thing that I do find a gel or roller pen useful for is mixed media art journaling. I need a pen that writes smoothly over many textures and surfaces without skipping or clogging. I noticed the Z4 pen in our local drugstore one day and decided I'd see what it was like. I also bought a Uniball Signo 207 that day. The Z4 is the only one that made the cut.I think this is an excellent pen - smooth writing -over acrylics, watercolors and a variety of mixed media surfaces that would make any other pen skip and clog like crazy. Yippee Skippee - a pen that works well for me - other than my beloved fountain pens that is!"
3,Fun Read,"A fun little run through various presidents. Some of the scenarios are more easily believable than others. The last scenario regarding Michael Dukakis was utterly farcical, but the rest of the book wasn't bad."
2,Does not fulfill promising concept.,"This is definitely a 'what if' book. Unfortunately, it is 'what if there were any interesting stories in here'? Some merely have a basic PREMISE, establish it in a few unmemorable pages, and then end the story. Nothing very good here."
4,Horror for the Masses,"A positively fascinating collection of short stories by good ol' Franz Kafka. The fascination and the horror of these stories is positively captivating. The Metamorphosis, In The Penal Colony and The Hunger Artist become something than just curious entities that were written before our time. They become metaphors and interesting takes on society and the so-called humanity of human nature. The stories are just as current as they are when they were written.It is nothing short of inspirational for horror writers and for the mind that is open to reading between the lines of some positively phenomenal writing. Fantastic!"
3,Latin Music,"This is Latin music. I was under the (mistaken) impression that this was various types of music. Not so. It was produced well and introduces it at various levels, but the fact that I so easily missed it puts it at a lower level for me (I did not see the actual packaging, but what was ""marketed"")."
5,Great story for all ages,This is an excellent book to read aloud with your children. Anyone who loves horses will find it easy to get involved with the ponies of Chincoteague. All Marguerite Henry's books are wonderful to read.
5,Silky Crayons,"Bought these for my 3 yr old daughter at Christmas. She loves them. I had seen these at a Children's Museum and they are just what I was looking for. Would recommend them to any child that loves to color, draw, etc."
3,It could have been so much more...,"Like their earlier 1989 Pink Floyd recording, this recording of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra playing Pink Floyd could have been so much better than it was. Essentially, it is a recording of a Pink Floyd tribute band backed by an orchestra. The use of electric guitar, electric bass, full trap set, vocalists and synthesizers detracts from the performance and leaves the listener longing for an actual symphonic version of these works. It would have been entirely different if it had been members of Pink Floyd contributing, however it was not. Therefore, it left something to be desired.For a fully symphonic Pink Floyd experience, try ""Us and Them"" by the London Philharmonic."
3,Overrated but worthy,"I don't think the other people reviewing this album really listened to it. Compared to 'Louder Than Hell', it's a rank recording, but as always, Sam does have his moments. Too often he slips into his 'Leader of the Banned' persona and forgets the wit of his earlier recordings. Bonus star for NOT including any music on this album."
4,get Louder Than hell first-,make it your first Kinison album. Track it down on vinyl or cassette. Then get the rest.Louder Than Hell is the besta nd earliest of Kinison's material!
1,Very disappointed in Purchase,The blanket I received wasn't white as in the picture. It was more a creme color. I was very disappointed. It was a thinner quality than others that I had purchased at a store and it was a much higher price than the ones that I bought at the store. I paid the extra because I wanted the WHITE blanket. I'm very disappointed with my purchase. What I got wasn't what I ordered.
2,MARTEX VELLUX BLANKET,"IT WAS DECENT QUALITY, BUT NOT AS SOFT AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED. I WAS EXPECTING A MUCH SOFTER FEEL. AGAIN, IF I WAS SEEING THIS ITEM IN THE STORE, I WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE MONEY & GOTTEN A SOFTER BLANKET."
2,Get What You Pay For,"This blanket is priced on the dot - if it were more expensive I would have returned it. It is nothing special, not breathable, and not really cozy or inviting. It is cheap, and it feels cheap."
4,Could be a bit bigger...,"I love the texture and weight of this blanket. It's perfect. In the winter, I use it under my comforter, and in the summer, I just use it with a sheet. It washes easily and remains soft.My one complaint is the size. When I lay my king size blanket on my king size bed, I want it to cover the top of the mattress and drape over by a few inches. This does not- it maybe has a couple of inches on each side. If they made this product in a king coverlet/ quilt size, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat. However, it's still good quality and very comfortable, not to mention very reasonably priced."
5,So Soft,My Daughter just loves the feel of this. She would rather have this on her instead of the sheet because it is so soft.
2,It is a nice blanket.,"The blanket is the size, thickness, and texture that I expected. The blanket was discolored in one spot. I guess from sun damage. Packaged it might have been sitting sunnyside up."
2,Vellux Blanket,"This is a great blanket, Lighweight yet warm and cosy. I now have three of them in different colours. Vellux is a great material."
4,Great value for good price,It is little bit small than a regular 12 inch pan but its great for that price.
3,Don't expect the greatest blanket experience of your life,"I don't believe there is such a thing as high quality Vellux. With that said, this blanket is warm, soft (kind of), comes in lots of colors and is easily cared for. This is an ok blanket. A great college blanket. It's been my experience, after a while (few years if cared for)they tear. (I think drying temperature can play a big role in the life of this blanket, high heat short life, low heat keeps it going a bit longer. Most friends I've known who have had one ""fried"" them in the dryer.) I purchased a Hunter Green blanket to replace a girlfriends old torn one. For the price, not a bad blanket, maybe even a good blanket, just don't expect more than what it is, Vellux."
3,Pretty Good overall,"I bought this for my mother since she's been using this blanket for years. The transaction and shipping process was a breeze. She wasn't a fan of the product since she thought it was ""too thin"" but my father loves it."
2,martex,"I love martex but this blanket was cut wrong. One side was not straight but an extremely noticeable diagonal rending it impossible to use as a ""top"" covering. I just didn't have the time to return it and used it as an underblanket."
1,faded blanket,"The blanket had terrible fading along certain folds, as if it were sitting where there was outside sun coming into a window. The blanket looked old and used because of the strange fading. I usually love these Vellux blankets..., but not this one!"
1,TERRIBLE SMELLING BLANKET,THE BLANKET HAS A TERRIBLE TOXIC SMELL. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE IT AS I DON'T EVEN WANT TO UNWRAP IT AGAIN TO WASH IT.
4,Excellent product,"Extremely light, very soft on body, cozy and comfort its perfect for the sleep. The material is good easy to wash i have washed it twice but the quality still remains the same... i bought the light n dark shades...."
2,could be better,"This is ok, but I bought a similar one few years ago at a Kmart store (martha stewart's) that was way better than this, softer and more velvet-like."
3,Good packaging,"Good packaging for travel. Used a 30-day supply and there was NO difference in energy, stamina. Not worth the money."
4,Far Superior to the First One!!!!,"Actually, in retrospect, the first tribute wasn't too bad - my biggest complaints were with Celine Dion/Dance With My Father, and the standouts were Ledisi & Layla but for the most part, a very admirable tribute album. The second set is quite nice with an equally stellar cast providing very tasty interpretations of Vandross classics. Quite honestly, I didn't even know a second set was available. When taken together, they both provide an excellent tribute set to Luther and well worth adding to your collection."
4,Just as good as Vol. 1,Great choices of Luther songs. Good easy lisening music. If you love Luther and jazz-you will love this album
3,A boring follow up to Civ 3,"I can't put my finger on it, but this game was just a completely boring follow up to Civ 3. The graphics and audio are definitely more advanced and the game options (religions, techs, actions, etc) are more plentiful, overall, I played for hours and just didn't care. It's dull. Try out a demo online before buying."
4,Beginner in a serious game,"I bought Civ IV on recommendation from my son. He thought I would enjoy it as a time filler now that I am retired and have time to do these things! Well, time is not that free, but I do find the game a lot of fun. You can really get into it, but don't try to jump right in, like I did! I didn't even know how to begin till I went through the tutorial, it is a must for first timers. Then I spent 2 days on the first game, really intense!! LOL"
3,Incompatible with Windows 8,"The version I bought closed down after a few uses with Windows 8 and will not come back. I'm waiting for the right version. Okay while it lasted, though a bit slow."
3,Not worth alot but good for a starter kitchen.,"I think that the set is ok but not worth what I paid, about $40. The spatulate broke the second day I had it. But the another piece are ok the can opener is the best piece."
5,Excellent Glimpse of the Man,"If you've read ""The Heroes Journey,"" then you won't find any new information here. What you will get, however, is extensive interview footage of Campbell that, as far as I know, isn't available anywhere else. And if you haven't read the book, this is an excellent introduction into Campbell's primary insights (the religions/myths of the world aren't just false stories...they are incredibly meaningful expressions of Man's wonder before the mystery of Everything...among others), and how he managed to reach them.A nice quality production, intelligently written, with plentiful input from the man himself.One question though...Campbell claims that he saved up enough money playing saxophone in a jazz combo to go without a job for 5 years...simply living in a cottage and reading all day!!! Speaking as a semi-professional musician, how the heck did he manage THAT?!?!?!?"
4,The Hero's Journey,"The Hero's Journey is the journey of one of our greatest mythologist's own life journey - that of Joseph Campbell. It shares his life and philosophies in some wonderful dialogues. Beautifully presented, it is a wonderful addition to any Campbell enthusiasts library, though perhaps not for a Campbell novice."
5,A TERRIFIC CAMPING HEATER,Just a perfect camp heater that can be adjusted from 1 to 3 burners and easily changeable from tank to tank. Changes a cold morning into pleasantness.
2,Should have been better,"Really thought this would be a good unit. However, within the first hour, one of the burners failed and refused to stay lit. The manual suggests adjusting the thermocouple but it would not work, which might mean the thermocouple is bad.the other two burners are currently working, but the grills have already burner through where the thermocouples come in close proximity to them.After a couple weeks of use, I have concluded that my money could have been better spent. NOT on my reccomended list, folks."
3,Dremel Router Bits,"I like the Dremel router bits for their designs, but I wish they would use carbide to make them last longer. These get dull after just a few uses."
3,Does not fit Dremel Trio,"Bought this for my husband who just received the Dremel Trio as a gift. This was listed as being an accesory for the Trio, however it is for the rotary Dremel only. I returned it and thankfully received my refund. Very happy Amazon stood by their reputation. Always have been very pleased with the service.The quality of the product looked very good, if it had fit the Trio."
2,Not really very useful,"I couldn't believe the guy who is using these for 3/4 plywood. Theye don't have that kind of power and burn easily unless you do ten passes. Not impressed at all, though I guess if I did dollhouseas I might find them useful."
3,Good for MTB and Hybrid Tires,"Good for what it does, gauge is nice although I had one where the gauge broke trying to fill a tire to 90psi. Amazon replaced it right away but I have yet to try it out over 65psi. One thing to note though once you get over the 45psi mark your gonna have to put alot of pressure on this to continue."
3,Couldn't get it to work,"Item shipped in a timely manner, but I couldn't get it to work and neither could my husband."
5,The Very Best Book in this Genre!,"This gem of a book is a must for anyone who is trying to help someone else with their ability to read. It is packed with useful lists, clear diagrams, silly stories, and funny cartoons. In a time of declining reading scores, this work is filling a deep need in an entertaining way."
1,Only good for children,"I was disappointed with this purchase. I took for 'someone' that it was directed at any age group. However, it is based on very child-based activities which are completely unsuitable for adults. Good for kids but not for anything else."
4,Groucho and Me,"I take pleasure in seeing pictures from and reading anything about circa early nineteen hundreds. Groucho tells of a time when you could make good clean fun out of dirt, or anything else for that matter. Out of being born dirt poor one day and then with fifteen years of hard core comedic work be filthy rich the next. He's telling stories of all the amusing circumstances along his way to the top. He shows how things have not change in the stock market; the mob buys into to market, everybody gets rich on paper and because they don't know when to sell they lose it all, in Groucho's case $250,000. In his charming way he pokes fun of everything, narrating wonderful ""true story"" lessons in history from that time period. If you like Groucho and stories about the Marx Brothers of Vaudeville, Broadway, Movies, and TV; stories about the show business industry from this time period then you will enjoy this book."
5,funny,"This is the best writer I have ever read. He is funny and witty, and way smart. Very entertaining. I recommend this book and his Mangy Lover book also. Wish he would of wrote many more. Can't put it down."
4,Groucho And Me,"This was an enjoyable read, although I must admit that I'm not an avid Marx brother's fan. I only happened to pick it up for about 75 cents on one of my many bike rides down to the used book store. But, I still found it bery entertaining. Groucho had a wonderful sense of humor. And, from beyond the grave, has still found away to put down his fans. ;-)"
5,"If you like Groucho, or entertainment history","Excellent book, well written with Groucho's unique wit and sarcasm"
2,Groucho talks about everything except Groucho,Groucho does what he does best and that is telling amusing stories. It's entertaining but lacks any great insight into who Groucho actually was.
3,Not the best View Askew Movie,"First let me start off saying that I am a huge View Askew fan. I've seen all the movies at least ten times and I love every one of them. Now, back to this movie. It really didn't do much for me. The movie was pretty short and took a half an hour to get exciting or really make much sense. The first half an hour was really boring.It was nice to see Jason Mewes in a non Jay role, but you could tell he was playing a Jay type character, only not named Jay this time. Many other people from other View Askew movies appeared with the best of them Being Jason Lee. He is such an amazing actor, Smith states before the film that this movie prompted him to put Lee in the co-star role in Chasing Amy.This movie was just average. If you're a huge View Askew fan, buy it so you can see some early work of other members of the View Askew family. Otherwise, pass and buy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
2,Eh. . .,Well as much as I love everything that Kevin Smith is associated with this was not that funny and just over all boring. I kept wondering. And before I knew it I forgot that I was watching the movie. If you are a Kevin Smith fan just borrow it from a friend and don't waste your money.
1,a waste of time,"This film is a bit like ""blair witch"" meets ""clerks"".Unfortunately, it's the worst of both worlds. The film fails at having any sort of suspense or real drama, and at the same time fails to have any witty dialogue so characteristic of view askew's most famous film: ""clerks"".The story is razor thin and uninteresting. The characters, despite being played by those well known to Kevin Smith fans (e.g. Jason Mewes), are undeveloped and pretty dull.If you do insist on wasting your time, at least save your money. If you're a big Kevin Smith fan who just have to see this, go rent it - save your money for a movie worth watching twice."
4,"Clever, bizarre and a lot of fun","If you're looking for a textbook definition of how to make a movie, this is not the place to go. The direction is pretty poor, the cuts are terrible and the transfer on the disc is sub-par at best.But the story is a LOT of fun.Jason Lee heads up a cast of mostly View Askew regulars (including the woefully underused Renee Humphrey and a cameo by the always-beautiful Joey Lauren Adams) on a trek deep into the woods of Vancouver. To say any more would be to give away too much, but suffice it to say this movie gets weirder with every scene.The strength of the film lies in a really good cast working with a totally off-the-wall script. If you can stand some of the poorer technical aspects, it's a movie worth watching. (And let's face it, ""Clerks"" wasn't exactly a directoral masterpiece either.)This movie is especially nice for View Askew fans for the chance to see Jason Mewes play a character other than Jay for a change."
5,all day knee pads,"The Fiskars Ultra Light Kneelers Knee pads are very easy to wear. I put them on in the morning to do landscaping, gardening, tile laying, household chores, construction projects, and painting. And 10 hours later, my knees are still ready for more work. I scrub them off each evening with a brush and soap and water. The strap wraps below the bend in the back of the knee which makes them so easy to wear. I even forget that I have them on. Mine are 3 years old and going strong with possibly 3000+ hours of use. Use good common sense for their use and cleaning and you should have knee friends for a long time."
4,JELLO WITH NO SUGAR,"Great flavor, but you need to really mix it up good or it will settle in the bottom.OVER ALL GREAT PRODUCT"
4,Base coat,This is a great base coat with a slight tint. Lipstick stays longer and has a pretty shade.
4,beauty with a scar,"awesome machine - does everything you would want it to do - well everything that you would want a mixer to do - and a nice classic look - easy to use. seriously heavy though - so - not something to be carried around - check carefully when you unpackage it - this one had a bubble in the enamel - in a place that you might not notice - but for what it is and at this price - the packager should have noticed it - not Amazon - but Kitchen Aid. Surprisingly did not come in another box - but in it's own regular/retail box - but that didn't hurt it any. this particular model ""the ultra"" - is hard to find at retail - it's either the lower powered one (250) or the higher powered ones."
4,Good mixer,"I have only gotten to use this mixer one time. It worked okay, but I had a really hard time getting it to mix well, and ended up hand mixing everything stuck in the bottom! I didn't expect that for the price!"
1,Leaks motor oil into your food,I am one of hundreds (if not thousands) of unhappy customers who have had to throw away batches of food because the faulty design of the mixer allows motor oil to leak from the output shaft directly into your food. Look at all the complaints at[...]The company could care less.
2,"Some good, some bad.","This thing works great for an ice shanty or some other kind of tiny enclosed space but if you want to actually heat an area, do yourself a favor and get a convection heater. This thing is a PITA to light and it's flimsy to say the least but you get what you pay for. I did manage to not freeze to death while working in a garage years ago in the middle of our wisconsin winters (-10* to -30*) with it while bundled up in lots of snow clothes though. I'll be going with a 35k btu convection style this winter and passing this lil guy along to whoever needs it.Pros-It's cheap.It kinda works.Did I mention that it's cheap?Cons-It makes things warm via infrared, not the area it's in, aka you move and you're cold.MOST of the heat heads straight up from it, not straight out.It's fragile, don't toss it into the back of your truck because you'll bend tubes/etc.If you live above the 40* latitude line, get something better."
1,I'd give it a ZERO STARS if I could,"We borrowed this DVD from a friend (thank goodness didn't waste any of our own money on it).It's a COMPLETE and TOTAL JOKE!!! The psychic Cathe, is by far the worst part--talking to ""spirits"" as though they are all 3-year-olds and showing ""orbs"" which are not ""astounding"" they are DUST! She is so ridiculous, you will LAUGH!! So, if you do enjoy and good cheesey laugh, this dvd might be for you. If you're looking for an AUTHENTIC paranormal documentary--save your time & money! This is the WORST!"
3,should be a movie,"Harms way is an exciting story.It would make a great movie.It would be a better movie than a book. The action is non-stop. But the writing sounds like it was done by a professional marketeer and not a professional novelist. The grammar goofs will annoy those who spot them and distract them from the action that is based on an interesting premise. The movie version would filter these minor annoyances out.Not Shakespeare, not Clancy, but as good as most books in the airport rack.If you like action stories read this book. If you love English Literature then wait for the movie."
1,"Very Cheap, Very Bad!!!","I baught a 6gb drive & after only 3 months of minimal use it failed. I tried to call the phone # on the warranty card but it is disconnected. I tried to put in a service request on the website, but it requires a serial # which is not on the device. I have received no responce to any of my inquiries."
3,Won't ship to APO address!,"I would love to order this and a sewing machine case, but they won't ship to an APO address and I don't understand why! It is within the wieght and dimension allowance and is not banned from Australia!"
1,In the Land of Blood and Honey,This movie is inaccurate. The statistics at the end of the movie do not correspond to the findings of the ICTY. Very unfortunate. Another movie which is incapable of capturing the complicated history of Eastern Europe.
3,the long tale,"It was a good movie--but--it kept repeating itself over and over--It was ""not"" as good as they said it was---worth seeing tho."
4,Waterproof and Rugged,I have had the rubberized pads in the past. They were uncomfortable and eventually craked or the straps broke. The Fiskars Kneelers are a waterproof fabric covering a thick padding. After a recent rain I did some weeding and they are waterproof. They are so much more comfortable to wear and to walk around in. I am happy so far with the Kneelers.
4,Purchased as a gift,I purchased 2 sets both as gifts. Both my Father and my Sister said they like them and they provide protection for the knees.
4,gives me happy feet,this was (is) one of Funkadelic best! (not just) Knee deep is the essence of 70s funk and dance music! Something about the music. It got into my pants. : )
3,Menemsha Madness,"Jean Stone is an extremely gifted writer. Here she takes up one of the most vexing social issues of our times: the ease with which innocent people can be ruined by false accusations of child abuse. For all that, I'm a bit baffled that the creator of the inspiring Jess Bates Randall and the ensemble in Sins of Innocence and its brilliant sequel, Tides of the Heart, devotes her powerful talent to chronicling the fortunes of the uninspiring Ben, Jill, their families, friends and neighbors.The tale is a comedy of sad, unintended errors on the part of people who, for all their wealth, privilege and success, seem rather shallow and surprisingly inept. They make all sorts of assumptions about one another that they never bother to check out, seem to have slight insight into their own motivations and, though they want to believe they have faith and trust in one another, they really don't. ..."
1,Salon Pas Hot Patches,I never received them.What more can I say?? Purchased 7/20 and now 8/21. How can I rate them? What more can I say??
2,Bad Skin Reaction,"The patch began to get very hot and itched after 2 1/2 hrs. I removed it, but still had a raised, red and itchy place on my upper back where the patch had been when I woke up 10 hours later. I had used another of the patches on my arm, did not have the reaction, but found the patch very difficult to remove. It's possible I had an allergic reaction to the product, but my caveat would be that, if the patch starts to feel increasingly hot, and/or itches, remove it immediately and put some sort of balm on it."
5,Boston CD,"Got it for my husband for Christmas. He is really enjoying his classic rock n' roll Boston CD, great price too."
1,Not worth the trouble,I thought this would be a great heater for use in a spare room with no heat. The ad says you can use it inside and it used propane which burns clean. The small print says you need to leave a window or door open. It stinks of fumes and suckes up a single tank very fast. The heat does not radiate out but rather goes straight up. Not very useful anywhere. I returned it.
4,Good Design but Hard to Start,"Not easy to get started, but great once you get it going. toasty. I have 2 CO detectors just in case the low O2 sensors fail. Low O2 results in incomcombustion which results in higher levels of CO. Alright old man winter, Im ready for ya. Bring it on!"
3,Best solution with this heater,"Like many others, I have struggled with inconsistent operation of Mr. Heater. Trying all other solutions, I finally took the unit apart and replaced the thermocouple with a hardware store generic thermocouple. The unit has worked great ever since. I think the thermocouple is undersized for the valve. It does not have enough voltage to keep the safety valve open. This explains one of the most common problems: the pilot will not stay lit."
3,Plastic melting,"I purchased a Mr. HEATER, portable BUDDY, model #MH9B heate two years ago. The heater has done an excellent job until I noticed the other day the heater its self is melting where the gas hose conects to the heater. I use the 20# tank with this heater. I took the heater to the local Lowe's store where I purchased the heater an they agreeded with me that it would be dangerous to continue using the heater however, they would not replace the unit due to the fact the warranty had expired.The unit does come with a one year limited warranty. However, I feel this material was defective or the plastic would never melted over a two year period.I do not want to go buy another heater an the same thing happen a year or two from now.If you own one of these heaters please check the heater where the hose screws into the unit.Sincerely,Stan Cohen"
4,Little Heater is a Big help!,"This heater has a small footprint and doesn't take up much space. It is working great in our garage as a supplement to our electric heater. It is nice and toasty up close to it, and it warms our 2 car garage up slowly to a decent level to do woodworking. It is perfect because my second electric heater was tripping the circuit breaker whenever I used power tools.The only thing to remember is to keep it away from the sawdust! I like it so much, we're buying another one, so we can ditch the other electric heater. (I'm tired of tripping on cords!)"
2,Good when pilot remains lit,"I purchased a unit in Spring 2003. The unit was used throughout the summer in our tent trailer when the morning temperatures dipped below 40 degrees. We used a 5 gallon propane tank connected via a 12 foot extension hose with little issue. Unfortunately, the unit no longer works after being stored in the OEM's box for three months time. As far as I can tell the pilot will no longer remain lit, which makes the unit useless to me. I tried all the maintenance and troubleshooting tips and pursued alternative propane sources.In summary, when the unit works, enjoy it! My unit's useful life ended way too premature for a $80 investment. I would NOT recommend for purchase."
1,Altitude problems,"The altitude where I live in Colorado is about 6300'. The heater works great in my garage, but if I take it camping, which is what I bought it for, it's worthless. I spent a couple of cold nights trying to keep it lit before I found out it won't work above 7000'."
1,Complete Nonsense from The History Channel,"Every time this film airs, the real Vietnam veterans and their families should be outraged... not to mention the disparaging light in which this film places Vietnamese women. In the words of the famous Dr. Douglas Pike (recently deceased) of the Vietnam Center in Lubbock Texas, ""I don't know what this is, but it's not history."" I have given this film a single star, because it does accomplish one thing: an addition to The History Channel's deserved reputation for perpetuating the myths about Vietnam and the servicemen and their families who served their country at great sacrifice."
1,Poor product,"I bought this cable for the same reason as another reviewer on here; I needed a headphone extension to reach my computer tower under my desk at work. I'd say this product worked for about a month before the left speaker wire detached itself inside the plug boot. I could get sound out of it if I jiggled the wire in the hopes of making a connection, but that would always be temporary. I definitely suggest spending a few extra dollars and getting a quality extension cord."
5,Christmas Gift,"I got this for my niece to help her someday remember her grandparents. (Yes, they are still alive.)"
4,Applause for the Applause,"I am a 57 year old beginning guitar player. My knowledge of guitars is limited to my 2 beginning guitars. This Ovation is much better sounding than my other guitar, which is one promoted by Esteban. The sound from the Applause seems to last longer, and the sound is brighter than the other guitar. The Applause is also visually appealing, which makes me want to pick it up, look at it, and then play it. I haven't connected it to an amp yet, but in about 10 years, when I am a 67 year old rocking chair star, I will probably still be playing the same Applause.The neck, measured at the nut, is about 1/4 inch narrower than the other guitar. That doesn't seem like much when you divide the space by 6 strings, but it is enough that I have to hold my fingers a little differently when I make chords. But I would rather do that than play the other guitar.All in all, I like this guitar. I am glad that I bought it."
5,Great guitar for price,"I have not played a guitar in 25 years until 2 months ago. While doing some cleaning I dug my old Bently out and started playing again. After about 2 weeks I went to a local music shop to buy strings and looked at an Ovation Applause. I loved the roundback design, and the honey burst color. Ended up buying one online and have not been able to put it down since. Compared to my old guitar it is supreme. A friend of mine that has played for 30 years in bands and all came over to my house a week ago and tried it and he said it was one of the best guitars he has played since an Ivanez he once owned in the 80's. The only real fault I had at first with it was it was hard to hold with the roundback design but after about 2 days I became used to it and now love the feel of it. Verdict is a good guitar for the money. If you spend more I know there is better but since this is a hobby not something I am doing for a living it is great and a nice update from what I had."
4,Solid Performer,"I have been playing guitars since I was 16 -- I'm now 64. I have always admired the Ovation line of guitars, but they are more expensive than I am willing to lay out for another guitar. I own several Yamaha guitars and an assortment of banjos, a ukelele, a mandolin and an off-brand classical guitar. I purchased this Applause on a whim using a couple of gift cards I received for father's day. This not as good as the high-end Ovations, but for the money it can't be beat! It is extremely durable and very easy to play. It has good volume unplugged and sounds even better using the included electric option. The neck is easily adjusted using the included wrench. The frets are accurate and it stays in tune with out frequent adjustments. I would recommend this guitar for anyone that needs a sturdy, well designed guitar, at a very low price."
1,What kind of sick people are you!!,"Where to begin... The Story is not quite FF but i mean the brickster stealing pizza? What!? And instead of sending police they send pepper, the delivery boy. But at least the world is huge and interactive as can be (sarcasm) . And then they throw in some cards wich have no real purpose other than seeing the characters with better graphics. and last but not least the most arrupt ending wich made me think i was still playing the game. all in all the game took me 35 min. to beat (try to beat my record)"
2,Well . . .,". . . they're very cool coasters, but they'd be a lot better if they'd hold drinks.You can't tell from the product images, but these things are flat only on the bottom, not on the top. They won't even stack straight reliably in the skull-shaped holder, let alone hold a flat-bottomed drink glass safely. Almost anything except a stemmed glass with an indented bottom (or a very wide glass that reaches all the way across the coaster) wobbles on the bumpy skull in the middle.It's too bad, because it's a very nice design otherwise. But if something is supposed to be a coaster, and it's useless for 80% of my glassware, it's not getting more than two stars out of five from me."
2,doesn't work!,it had to be plugged in to be operated. not cool at all still waiting for a reply to my numerous emails!
4,'Krautrock' - Various Artists (Universal),"Fifteen tracks, one each by some rather obscure/lesser known kraut bands like Yatha Sidra,Sperrmull and Novalis. Then, of course you have several of the better known acts like Harmonia, Embryo, Faust, Guru Guru and Jane. Musically speaking, the CD is a bit uneven I thought. But, still a decent introduction to this genre to any newcomers. Sound quality is great, apparently these cuts have all been remastered from the original tapes, so says the informative booklet."
2,Rio Carnival 1,"Most of the photography was fairly good, but once in a while the back of a person's head or body block the view of the parade as it appeared that this video was taken from the forth or fifth row of a grandstand seat. There was no narration, just a musical background, of course narration would most likely would have been in Portuguese which wouldn't have helped either. It appeared that there was more parade than was recorded."
5,The Straight Story - Heart Warming,"Slow paced with kindness, grace, warmth and caring seen throughout the movie. Reminds me of a time in life that is sadly forever gone."
2,"Love the show, poor quality recordings/DVDs","I loved this show as a kid. I was excited to see it finally offered. However, it is a very poor quality set. The DVDs are not numbered, they are packaged in an odd way that stacks them against each other, there are no special features and worse part of the quality of the recordings. They are faded and sometimes a bit jumpy. All that beautiful scenery I remember is faded yellow/brown. Like watching a 20 year old VHS tape. I would love to see this digitally remastered. We'll watch them still - but would wait for a better version before buying any other seasons. I wouldn't recommend this set."
3,It's ok ...,"Smaller and thinner than I expected. I have it for my free weights. Had to buy a carpet pad to put under it. I use it in my basement and had it on the concrete floor. Not thick enough to protect the floor from getting cracked if I dropped the weight on it. It's ok, but I'm sure there are better"
4,Connection of sacred energy,"This video is a trip to be sure. A convergence of spiritual energy in Cornwall, England is explained through the use of quantum physics. Heady stuff to be sure. Great insights by a brilliant man."
1,Bowie allowed this garbage to be officially released?!?!,"I'm a lifetime fan of Bowie. I love Bowie.I usually love the remixes of his songs - quite often more so than the originals, the Pet Shop Boy's ""Hallo Spaceboy"" remix being one fine example.But this...I absolutely, really can't believe this sorry excuse for a record has been released with Bowie's full approval. It's terrible!Whoever this Guetta character is, he CANNOT make decent dance music. What he's done here is, basically, just sampled the line ""We can be heroes just for one day"" and repeats it all the way through the track ad nauseum and beyond! And, worst still, it barely mixes cohesively with the extremely tacky, simplistic beat.Trust me on this: Nobody really needs this for their music collection, Bowie fans or otherwise. It's pathetic and yet another example of the latest ""big name in the world of club DJs"" who are just a load of hype and have little to zero creative talent.DAVID GUETTA HAS KILLED A CLASSIC!"
4,The Tombs of Atuan,"In my opnion, this is the best of the four Earthsea books and the only one I really like. The other three were not very intresting or with very imaginative characters and ideas, especially Tehanu, which seemed to have no plot at all. I don't like the Earthsea series very much because women don't play much part in it as they can't be wizards, so it was good in this one to have a main character who's female. It drew me in right away with the descriptions of the strange rituals and religion surrounding Tenar's life. I don't think it was slow to start. It might be best to read 'A Wizard of Earthsea.' first to be introduced to Ged and the world of Earthsea, but don't be put off if you don't like it that much, give this one a try."
2,"It was ok, but kinda predictable","Despite the stellar reviews that this book got from other readers, I was not impressed by Tombs of Atuan. To me, the storyline was just connect-the-dots, run-of-the-mill fantasy. Nothing new, nothing interesting. The dialouge was kinda ho-hum, too. The only plus side that I saw to this book was the characters and I thought the ending was somewhat interesting. I did not read the other books in this series so it is possible that my reveiw would have been a little more positive if I had done so. But overall, A big Ho-Hum."
3,A good read,I haven't read any of the other books in the earth sea trilogy but i did enjoy this book! I thought it to be quite good at the beginning but towards the end where it should have been more exiting it was not. This was a good read but from what i've heard the other books in the series are much better.
3,Pretty Good,"The Tombs of Atuan is good when you first start reading it, but once you get into it, it's a little boring. The ending sort of leaves you hanging, too. Still, it was well written, and the charactrs were true to life. But I think other LeGuin books were better."
3,Sparrowhawk's Quest,"In A Wizard of Earthsea, we read a coming of age story about a boy who learns to become a wizard and a hero. Though it was a short book, there are really 3 quests that together turn Sparrowhawk/Ged into a great hero. In The Tombs of Atuan, we have a more traditional quest narrative. There is a single quest that our Hero must complete in order to cement his reputation as the greates wizard of Earthsea. The novel doesn't focus on him for much of the first third, however, and I think this is its main weakness, and why I didn't like it as much as the first in the series. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it, and think it's worth reading...but when following a classic (which Wizard of Earthsea definitely is), it's often hard to measure up."
3,Great story but could have been even better.,"What I would of liked to of seen was ""Ged"" and ""Tenar"" become sort of intimate with each other. I think they should be together. Even though""Ged"" is a little older than ""Tenar""."
2,Broke after using it one time,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I was disappointed when the plastic end clip that holds the band broke during normal use. Luckily, it was not a safety factor at that time, but if it had broken on the draw, I am sad to think what the recoiling band and broken plastic part would have done to my son's face. I don't recommend this product. I am in the process of trying to return it as defective."
2,Interesting story but juvenile writing.,"The story itself was an interesting one and thats the only reason I continued to read the book. Many times I would read a passage and have to stop to make sure I wasn't reading a 7th grader's ""current events"" paper. There is way too much repetition in the book, almost word for word describing the actual events of the murder. WE GOT IT THE FIRST TIME! Also, in my humble opinion, I believe that there were alot of ""fillers"" being used. I mean, come on, there is no reason to write 2 chapters about Soria Sr's Uncle's crimes. Touch base on it, but don't dwell on it.Bottom line is, it's a good story to write/read about, its just too bad it's grade school writing."
3,For the record,"For the record, I feel compelled to make it known that this monster did NOT come from a violent and evil family, his mother married into it (second marriage). The Tommy I grew up with (my cousin) as children was very sweet. Due to a tragic turn of events evil took hold and didn't stop until the very essense of innocence was taken. Im glad he is gone, good riddance and for the book? I can't get past the first few chapters for obvious reasons. But I did want to clarify that by blood...he was good, by circumstance...he didn't stand a chance. His mother (my Aunt) was naive to a fault. Nature versus nurture..I can verify that this definitely wasn't in his nature but rather learned over a period of years."
4,HARD TO READ!,"This book was graphic at times and sick and sad, all at the same time. How a father could do what he did to his son is way beyond me. What they both did to a 10 yr. old girl is beyond even my imagination. It was hard to read this book for me. I am glad that I only have about 10 more pages to go."
5,Informative!,"This book is great. It is objective and gets down to the nitty gritty issues. After reading this book you will almost be an expert on this subject. This is absolutely no ""hot-air"" in this book. It provides solid facts, in a conversational manner so it is not dry."
3,Scientific answers to World hunger?,"My thoughts have been centered on Geneticaly Modified food for some time, so was delighted to discover Allan McHughen's book ""The Potential and Hazards of Genetic Modified Foods' on Amazon.com. Living in S. Africa, we are very much aware of the shortage of food for large numbers of people on the African continent as well as in many other areas of the world. The need is not just bulk to ease the pangs of hunger, but food with high nutritional value. There is also a need for the scientific knowledge of how to grow proper food in carefuly nourished ground. I do hope that the scientific value to the human race can outweigh the risk of any commercial gain, and that the people who's needs are the greatest, can benefit from the work being done."
2,not as good,"I do like this game, but it isn't as good as the PC version. The vehicles have only 2 colors. It has low graphics. There is no parachute sub-game. I'd reccomend you get the PC version."
1,If I could give these negative stars I would,"Bought these brand-spanking new... literally made three cutting motions while trimming back last year's dead growth on some large ornamental grasses and the gears slipped, rendering the shears useless. It amazes me that a company can put such a shoddy product into the market place. Save yourself the frustration and money and get yourself a different set of shears."
1,Blades damaged after 10 minutes,"Like another review the blades on these shears hung up on each other after 10 minutes of use. I bought this model at Home Depot thinking it would last me forever. I live in a new home and my shrubs are very small but were needing some minor trimming. I was using these shears for about 10 minutes and all of a sudden they would not close all the way. I thought maybe a small branch was caught in them. When I looked at the blades there was a slight groove/nick on each blade and they were biting each other. As another review wrote, the blades are too soft or something. I took them back to Home Depot (having just bought them like 30 minutes earlier) and got the cheaper Fiskars shears. I finished the job with the cheaper shears with no problem."
5,Lives up to Expectations,"I recently purchased the Fiskars Hedge Shears and have used them several times since. The handles are comfortable to grip and the shears are lightweight making it easier to work for longer periods without straining my hands. I found the blades to be very sharp making it pretty simple to cut through my hedges-I know a few others who have had this product for a few years and it still works great for them. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the hedging shears and would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for a lightweight, durable hedging shear."
4,Really Cool!,A really humourous blend of a great jazzy trumpet riff with some good electronic backbeats.
3,Coffee table cheese book,"Nothing earth shattering in here, but a pretty book, full of accurate cheese data. If you're intimidated by cheese (is anyone intimidated by cheese?), this book is a good way to cram for the next exam."
3,"Not bad at all, but not really great either","I picked up this book when I was trying to find out which dog I wanted after narrowing down my choices. This book is pretty general and doesn't go into much detail. I still look at it once in a while, but still, if you're looking for a lot of information about the Mini Schnauzer, you're only going to find general info in here."
1,Dis is garbage,"This is the worst nolimit cd i have listened to. it wuz good the first time i listened to it but i now i dont even touch that garbage, he cant rap and all the beats sound the same. if u want real music by nolimit check out the ghettos are tryin to kill me and unpredictable"
3,What The Hell Happened?,"""Charge It 2 Da Game"" is a classic, but what happened with ""Made Man""? It's not nearly as good, It took all my strength to boost it up to three stars. Silkk's new alblum is just to soft for the real No Limit fans. I will say that ""What We Bout"" (With Master P and Jigga, great idea to get Jay-Z), ""This is 4 My..."", and ""It Ain't My Fault II) are exeptional tracks. ""We Won't Stop"" and ""Somebody Like Me"" are good too. But overall, this CD doesn't have any classics, and it's not a must buy, unlike ""Charge It 2 Da Game"" Get it together Silkk. I know you're tight. Don't go soft on the real souljas."
3,STILL BOUT IT BOUT IT???,"LAST YEAR ON CHARGE IT 2 DA GAME, I GAVE SILKK 4 STARS, BUT I THINK HE LOST ONE ON THIS ONE. IT AINT MY FAULT PT.2 IS A TIGHT FOLLOW UP TO PT.1, BUT THE ALBUM LACKS TIGHT BEATS, RHYMES, AND THE HIGHLIGHT OF IT IS THE TWO SINGLES, SOMEBODY LIKE ME W/ MYA, AND IT AINT MY FAULT PT.2 W/ MYSTIKAL. SILKK AND N.L. ARE GOING TO EVENTUALLY FALL OFF, THEY NEED TO BRING THEIR OLD STYLES BACK YA DIG.... ONE LUV, DLUV00"
1,a sorry effort,"Following the release of Silkk the Shocker's platinum album Charge it 2 da game, P's younger brother received a lot of critical acclaim. His second effort fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessor.Packed with appearances from Master P , Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Mya, C-Murder and Mystikal, Silkk is often lost in the mix. What is missing is the intensity displayed on Charge it 2 da game. For example, there is no soldier anthem, and even the guests are dissapointing.A few good tracks like ""Somebody like me"" with Mya or ""Southside playas"" with big bro C-Murder can't save the album. The entire thing seems hasty, as if it has been thrown together in a single day.This marked the collapse of P's once invincible empire. Most of the original soldiers jumped ship and P's releases went virtually unnoticed by once die-hard no limit fans. These days P is trying to re-build the empire he created 7 years ago. You can only sympathize."
4,Silk The Shocker is the Shit!!!,"Silk puts it down for the south once again. Even though this album is not as dope as Charge It 2 The Game, Silk still shows that he hasn't forgotten where he came from."
3,"Elegant and nice, doesn't always work","This is very nice and elegant looking - definitely an ""executive"" pen/stylus. However, sometimes you really have to TAP to make it work. Or it could be a matter of getting used to using a touch stylus tool vs. the finger so that could be an adjustment. But for the most part, it does work great and looks classy. I wish it did have a loop or something that could hook into the headphone jack so that I didn't have to carry it around separately and could attach to iPad or whatnot."
4,"More on this, than the live action DVDs","I'm often asked, ""Who is the best Batman?"" No doubt about it. Kevin Conroy IS Batman. He has the overpowering voice that puts fear into criminals. Tim Daly is awesome as Superman. Like Conroy, he has an excellent Superman voice; but, in a different way.The animated series of Batman & Superman were well written, well voiced, & were drawn very well.Filled with features, unlike the live action DVDs, The batman/Superman DVD is sure to be among the best ever animated DVDs. The major drawback, however, is, there is always so much more they could have done. It seems as if ALL the DVDs have the same extras. Some interviews with the actors, and some deleted scenes and other behind the scenes clips is always awesome.I give this a 41/2 out of 5 stars. Or, 95 of 100."
3,"Good, but what happened to the Joker??????","This was a good movie for the fans of Batman and Superman, but I think that only those fans will enjoy it. I thought I would voice my comment on this, but I would ask you Batman animated fans if you like the way the Joker is now animated, personally I HATE IT!!! he looks terrible, when I put in the Batman Superman video I hoped that the cover to the VHS copy was decieving me, but to my shock I found that the Joker lokes like a badly sharpened pencil. The way the Joker used to look was peeked in the Batman movie ""Mask of the Phantasm"" he looked wonderful, he looked like a real human being, but now he just looks incredibly stupid! thank goodness they didn't change Mark Hamill from doing the voice he's great!! In all the action in this show is great, but I'm still recovering from the shock of seeing my favorite villian mangled."
5,Very good and full of action.,An exellent movie with a great story line. The animation is also very good. This is one of the best Batman movies out there.
4,Cheaper than buying pieces separately,"There is not much to review here. I needed some additional polishing supplies for my Dremels and bought this inexpensive collection rather than buying each one separately. Since these supplies are somewhat generic, the only real questions are 1)are they of acceptable quality? and 2) are the selling for a reasonable price? The answer to both questions is yes."
5,A masterpiece,"In any field, it is rare for a great master of his subject to write a lucid, book-length study that can be read and understood by comparative beginners in the subject. Here undoubtedly is such a book. Any serious student of the Old Testament knows the importance of making good use of the Septuagint. However, it has been more abused than used properly, especially for the correction of errors in the transmission of the Hebrew text. Tov shows how to get the maximum benefit from the Septuagint and carefully reveals all the pitfalls into which even specialists have blundered."
3,A Sales Tool?,"I liked that the book was a quick read. It gives you some nice tools that you may already have if you're already in the planning stages for your own business. But, if not, you can benefit from the information and tips. I could not find a couple of the forms they mentioned in the book, and that frustrated me when looking for them on the page they were said to be on. It's a smart tool that I believe is primarily intended to drive you to their business to sign on as host versus setting up your own business from scratch. I finished the book and viewing their website with a lot of questions still about starting a speed dating business. Some questions came to me as I read the book. The grammatical errors and misspellings in the book were annoying. But, for the cost of the book, it was a fair read."
4,Helped fit my space,"I had the gate but needed much more distance covered. The north states gate is great and with these extensions cover the distance that I needed well (about 60 inches). I installed them on both sides of the gate (enough though I think you are only supposed to install them on one side, thus not centering the gate). They work well, a little flex at the joints but nothing major and with the distance that they cover I am not surprised. I do not think this flexing is anything bad as I don't plan on using this to contain a three year old."
5,Excellent Lopper with Available Parts,"I had the same problem that another reviewer mentioned in that you can not buy the spare blade for this lopper at the retail outlets. Its not on the Fiskars website, either, so I e-mailed them and got a very helpful response. You have to call them at 800-500-4849 and you can buy any of the parts for any of the Fiskars products. They sent me a couple of pages out of their parts catalogue which detailed all the parts they sell. I'm planning on buying 2 spare blades --- even though they last a long time (mine lasted about a year of heavy use), when they go you can't sharpen them, so you'll want another one near by. If you do sharpen the blade, you will find that if you take off enough steel to get the sharp edge on the blade, the lopper blade no longer bypasses the stationary part and it renders the lopper useless. Still, this is the best garden tool I have, so I'm going to invest in the parts --- it beats buying a new one every year."
3,"High capacity, but weak handles","Works well but handles can't take the torque of a large person. Mine broke off after about a year of fairly heavy use. Also, has trouble with harder wood like mesquite."
4,Bjork at her best,"The M-tv live portion is really good.I think thathomogenic is a good record,and it works live.But the real treat is the unplugged performance.The live versions of the debut songs are arrangedamazingly.It would be a risk for anyone to altersounds as radically as she did with these musicians.a true testament to how in tune the woman is."
1,1 STAR CAUSE BJORK IS IT!!!,"THIS DVD IS UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING!! I BOUGHT IT CAUSE I LOVE BJORK AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HER LIVE. BUT THIS DVD IS SUCH A LET DOWN!! THE MTV UNPLUGGED PART WAS OK. IT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE SHE WASN'T INTO THE AUDIENCE. (DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A ""LIVE"" PERFORMANCE)! THE 2ND HALF, WAS EVEN WORSE BECAUSE SHE GETS INTO HER MUSIC AND HER AUDIENCE, BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY IS VERRRRRRRRYYYYYY BAD! YOU SEE BJORK SINGING BEHIND A ""POOL OF BLUE WATER WITH FISH IN IT"" I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS! ..."
3,Better than the last...,"'The First Amendment' is a much better read than its risible predecessor 'The Price you Pay', but that said it still has some problems. The storyline is implausible at best, and again it fails to feel like an episode of the TV show should. The characters feel more accurate this time around though and the banter sounds right, at least most of the time . As mentioned by previous reviewers the aliens don't work, they sound corny and so much so that even the characters in the book pointed it out! Some of the situations didn't ring true, especially in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex and SGC, I find it hard to believe that these people are that stupid. Also, the preview of the next book, 'The Morpheus Mandate' served only to put me off buying it, it really was poor. It's quite possible that this author either has little respect for, or scant grasp of, what makes Stargate SG-1 such a great concept and TV show. Maybe another author should step in and show her how it's done..."
3,Supermat - treadsolid,"For some reason, I assumed this mat would be thicker. It is more like a ""runner"" than a mat. It will work for putting under our recumbent bicycle, but would not work for an exercise mat."
5,A Great Heavy Duty Mat,"This mat is under a 250# treadmill. So far, it meets or surpasses all expectations. Great value."
1,Incorrect description,"The write-up for this product gave me the impression that this mat was thick, at least 1/4"", if not 3/8."" When the mat arrived, the box clearly said 3' x 6.5' by 1/8"". This product is a 1/8"" thick mat. If that's what you want, it might be fine. If not, you will end up having to return it like I did. At least Amazon was very quick with the return, but all of this back and forth could have been prevented by simply stating the thickness as 1/8"" in the item description."
4,interesting &revealing book about the west!,The history and details in this book take you back to the old western dayswhen guns and gangs ruled the streets of Indian territories. A must forthose who enjoyed Gunsmoke and like old westerns. worth purchasing!
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This book was bought after reading reviews. It was bought for a younger 'reading' child (who personally chose this book based on his love of animals). My children know the facts of life but after previewing the book and reading the section on ""Breeding"" I would NOT recommend this book for anyone other than adults. The choice of words used makes it TOTALLY unsuitable for children. PARENTS MAKE SURE YOU READ THROUGH THIS BOOK BEFORE BUYING!!"
2,"A Good Idea, Poorly Executed","I liked the simplicity of this thermometer compared to the other gadgets, but, it is nearly impossible to keep the water temp to a tenth of a degree, so as a result, the thermometer always says that the water is too hot or too cold. A range of degrees would be better. The product itself seemed durable and easy to store and clean, but, it was no help at all in telling me if the water temp was ok for my baby. Pass!"
1,A no-go on the iPad.,"This is not a capacitive stylus and is useless for most modern touch screen devices. It is for me, completely useless as a stylus and barely passible as a pen. It's cheap plastic and might be worth $0.50 (including shipping)."
2,eh,"ok heres the deal. i beat this game in less than 2 hours, no lie. the graphics are not good at all, but what can you expect from a game boy color game. this is incredibly easy with no challenge at all, if you put it on the easy setting which is probably meant for younger kids. if you put this game on medium, its a little more challenging, but not quite difficult. if you put this game on hard then its kinda difficult but mostly frusterating. so if you are really good at video games or you want a challenge or you are older, then dont get this game. but if you are looking to get this for a little kid or someone who has no video game expirience or just likes rocket power, then this is perfect."
5,Rocket power,It is the best nicklodian game boy game when it comes out 4 GBA(Gameboy advance) I am gonna get that 1 now that i have beet it it is of 2 spongebob the case of the legandary spatula and may I add ... I loned this game ROCKET POWER RULES...
3,Wild,"For starters, this book is written just like a screenplay. Marciano's writing is good, but she could do without the profanity. The book is mainly about how people try to find fulfillment in life through relationships with the opposite sex, they go from person to person using them up like old shoes. I wasn't satisfied with the ending, it seemed like a vicious cycle. Rules of the Wild really showed you how people could have every material possession and still have nothing."
1,"Bright Lights, Big City Set in Africa","This is a terrible book about petty, self-absorbed people who go around feeling cool about living in Africa. The high point is when Esme gets pregnant by a guy she likes, kind of loves. She suddenly feels she has a purpose in her life (we were wondering since this is half-way through the book). When she loses the baby, she is sad, but more than anything miffed at her ob/gyn for snubbing her. The best thing I can say about this book is that it makes the most ordinary of us feel profound and heroic for taking out the trash compared to these cardboard cut-out characters. The editorial reviews were very misleading. One reviewer compared Ms. Marciano to Jean Rhys. Anyone who has read The Wide Sargasso Sea would consider that a howler."
1,uh,"I couldn't read this book. Sorry, just didn't hold my interest. I thought I'd love it, I love Out of Africa. Gave this book to someone else and she couldn't get into it either."
5,"passionate and well written, a definite women book!","I loved it! I feel everything the heroin goes through, with all her pain, passion and anxiety. I understand her reasonings, her wishes and dreams. I long for the same adventure. I am still trying to find my own place here, and, aren't we all somehow?"
1,Awful!,"Shallow, narcissistic characters living directionless lives. A disconnected sequence of events that cannot be called a plot. An ending that introduces loads of new information and doesn't jibe with the established motives and substance of the characters. It stunk.Actually, the characters were the worst. I disliked them and their self-absorbed whining almost immediately and couldn't wait to get away from them at the end. Guess I finished the book out of sheer determination."
5,Good Research Material,"This book presents a wide range of information, both historical and current. It's an excellent reference book for those looking to understand the recent history of the country and how the country got to where it is today. It is essentially a collection of articles form a good range of authors, most of whom present information from a detached viewpoint with adequate information to back up any opinions presented."
2,Pure garbage,"You know you can count on Steve Ellner to pen a 200-page love letter to Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. If you want a serious analysis of the democratic erosion that has occurred under Chavez, I strongly recommend someone else's book."
2,"Great animation, but..........","The new Justice League cartoon has some of the best animation you'll see out there, however the story lines really need help. The selection of superhereos in the Justice League could also have been so much better. If this is DC Comics answer to the X-Men, then give the X-Men the upper hand."
3,Old superheroes never die ...why fade them away?,"Is it me or do these revamped superfriends looked a lot better in their recent animated series than they do here in JUSTICE LEAGUE? I mean, Superman's new costume has all its reds and yellows in a horrible whiter shade of pale, Batman now wears heels (why -is Wonder Woman taller than him?), Aquaman looks like a biker and the Martian Manhunter, well, he was never very interesting to begin with. Hawkgirl and the black Green Lantern look fine but they seem forced, like token minority superheroes. On top of it all, the stories, backgrounds and villains are dull and predictable; second-best at the most.Too bad, and certainly not what was expected from Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and their great animation studio. I dunno; it appears their new productions have run out of steam (or money). If so, go pester the people at Warner! Have them take another look at BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM and get inspired again, not just milk the supercow!!!"
3,Not in Widescreen Format,"I originally rated this DVD ""four stars,"" but the fact that it is presented in pan-and-scan rather than the original widescreen cablecast on the Cartoon Network changed my mind. I wonder if Warner Bros. will release another version in the future, just as they re-released BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER?The story is solid, the tweaks on the character designs are interesting (even the enlongated ears on Batman's costume), and it is fun to see the animated version of the DC Universe expanded even further. If this story lacks the verve and wit of the animated Batman series, it nonetheless offers solid entertainment. Other animated series would do well to follow the model presented by the Timm-designed animated DC heroes."
5,DermaPet MalAcetic Otic,We have been using this product on our golden retriever for over 10 years. As a pup he kept getting yeast infections in his ears. The vet recommended that we clean his ears every several days with this product and the problem has gone away. Obviously we continue to use the product for over 10 years which indicates how pleased we are with the results.
4,Hand mixer,"This item was purchased as a gift. It arrived timely and in good condition, but I am unable to review the item itself since it is not mine to use."
5,Worth the Money!,"After watching a friend use kettlebells for two years and become stronger and more flexible, I invested in this DVD and one kettlebell. I'm a visual learner, so it helped me understand proper form in each exercise. The information is presented with a sense of humor. I would also recommend getting the book as it goes into more detail on the strategy behind the program.I dropped one dress size in 3 weeks of training. It definitely works, and it feels good!"
1,"Trite, trite, trite.","This book takes advantage of the fear of being hacked by presenting the reader with a ton of paranoid, poorly written information. So many books before this one have approached network security in a much better manner. I've found so many mistakes in this book, or critical omissions, that I finally stopped reading it."
5,good item,This chair was sturdy and well made. It is ideal for grandchildren's visits as it can be easily set up and also stored in a small space.
5,These are the ones.,"I've purchased different brands of chickpeas for years to make hummus, and these are the best I've ever used. They're bigger, fresher, and more flavorful and anything else I've ever purchased and you won't find anything else with less sodium in a can. You also won't find them cheaper anywhere else, especially if you suscribe and save."
4,Fun Fun,"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a very fun game.It can be a little slow at times, but if your a fan of Indy than you should enjoy this title."
5,Simply amazing,"This whole series by Discovery and BBC(Planet Earth, Life, Nature's Most Amazing Events)come along at an amazing time. The time being where home entertainment (large screen HD, bluray surround sound etc.) can show off the great video. Each episode has something captivating in which I wanted to have them in my video library."
3,Like a rerun,It seems like the disc collects many bits and pieces from other shows. Skip it if you have other BBC planet series.
1,"NOTE: NOT IN A BLUE-RAY CASE, it's a low quality card board carrier.","I wish Amazon would warn people up front and in bold textthat the item mentioned is in a non-standard case, especially""eco-friendly"" cardboard carrier. It affects my decision ofwhere to buy it, how much to pay for it, and sometimes whetherto just rent it.I keep my videos for ""life"", but now I have tobuy a real case and try to figure out how to make a decentcover for it. It's a bloody waste of my timeand money. Hopefully, the documentary is up to theBBC's normal quality (IE. excellent) to make this worthwhile.The one star is only for the green-washed, ""eco-friendly"" case, not the documentary.Geez, how many people that are fans of this kind of documentary(IE. are in to nature) and wouldn't recycle a standard blu-ray case?"
5,super,"So much fun. My 90+ mother and I enjoyed this movie and giggled all through it. Doris Day and a western all in one. This one is not the typical Doris and kids against all odds. She is a free and wild single not even looking for romance but finds it anyway. Set in the Dakotas in the early days of expansion, Doris is an Annie Oakly type. She is viewed as one-of-the-guys until she goes to Chicago to find an actress to entertain the town's men. She has a few difficulties with this and ends up with a substitute. Very funny, a classic musical."
5,Best Musical of the 50's,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with Doris Day and Howard Keel. It was so much better than Annie Get Your Gun where Betty Hutton sang to herself or to the last row in the audience. There was so much chemistry and great songs. The Black Hills song is great and I thought all the songs were meant for Mr. Keel and Ms. Day. She was great in both ""characters"" and he is my hero! A must have."
1,Calamity Jane,"My movie does not play because apparently it's a Region 2 PAL disc. Am I the only one in the world that didn't know what that means? For others who may be as technologically ignorant as I am, it means it's intended for use in Japan, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, including Egypt. Region 1 NTSC is intended for use in the USA and Canada. It would be helpful if this was explained somewhere on the order page."
5,excellent family feature from Amazon,This is excellent family entertainment for all ages with a look at some of the great stars of our time. Amazon has been a gold mind of treasures not available in stores.
5,A Fantasy Production of an Historical Story,"This is a great, fun movie. Doris Day and Howard Keel at their best. The music is wonderful. Doris' ""Secret Love"" was number one on the hit list for many weeks.Black Hills scenery is beautiful. This is a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy."
4,Classic Comedy,"If you are hungry for humor, music and dance, Calamity Jane will feed that yearning. Doris Day and Howard Keel will blow your socks off in a duet about the black hills of Dakota. You will giggle picking out all the gymnastics in the many dance numbers. How many times does Doris Day slide in and out of a stagecoach window? I definitely recommend this DVD for your viewing pleasure."
5,Classic feel good movie,I have watched this movie so many times. the actors are timeless and the story is funny and makes you feel good. Doris Day is so cute in this role. Definitely a worthy classic.
5,awesome!,"Even though I was born almost 20 years after it was released, I have to say that I love this movie. I've been looking for Calamity Jane on DVD since I first saw it on video.Perfect for Doris Day fans. She has such a beautiful voice. So many songs to sing along to- I especially adore ""Secret Love""!Wonderful to see a young Philip Carey (One Life to Live's Asa Buchannan) work.A little P.I. but you have to take into consideration the time it was filmed.I highly recommend it!"
3,"Repetitive and Somewhat Heavy-Handed, but Still Helpful","This book is largely a collection of quotes from Charlotte Mason's writings, organized into thematic segments. I like that the author/editor has sifted through the volume of Ms. Mason's work to bring us these shining gems, but some quotes appear in several consecutive segments so that one has the sense of deja vu.Also, while Miss Mason was Christian, and Penny Gardner assuredly is, not every homeschooling family looking to the educational tenants espoused by this ground-breaking teacher share this religious perspective. The religious rhetoric added by this author is heavy-handed at times."
3,The Least Exciting Of The Series,"I would not suggest reading this one as a ""stand alone."" With The Inferno as the most horriffic place Dante's ever been & The Paradiso as the most wonderful, you can imagine (and you'd be correct) that Purgatory is the most middle-of-the-road. It's essential to the Divine Comedy as a whole, if you intend to follow & understand Dante's journey... but it's also the least impressive piece of the puzzle."
5,"Fresh, new voice, sings with passion and desire.","Griggs new work is but a taste of what we can expect from the younger new artists coming out of Nashville. The production takes advantage of his vocal range and the technical aspects are flawless. The hint of young love and the promises made in a first romance intrigue young lovers and begin the dream sequences of a life together. Roll out the carpet, close your eyes and dance once again with your first love."
3,Broan Trash Compactor Bags,"The trash compactor bags fit the Broan 12"" compactor fine. They are only the thickness of a normal trash bag."
5,Great bike rack,"Just got the bike rack this weekend. Nothing flimsy about it. 95% of the time I'll be putting just my bike on to go riding and it works great, used it twice this weekend without issues. The price is good and it really clamps on well to my spare tire (05 Jeep Liberty)"
2,"Deluxe? thats a joke to me, but i'm not laughing!",It is a bit flimsy with three bikes squeezed onto it. I was scared it might break while i drove. Bottom line is three kids bikes or two adults would work out ok.
2,"Be careful with 2007 Jeep Wrangler with 17"" tires","This Bike Rake Scratched my Wheel, I had to use a small towel to ensure the rack did not cause more damage of my wheel with the Goodyear Wrangler P255/75R15 Tire."
3,"Not made for a Rav4, but it works ok.","At first I wasn't sure this rack would work on my 2008 Rav4, but with some work it does. The arms that go over the tire are very very close to the wiper arm but it doesn't harm it. It's hard to attach the straps to the bottom of the tailgate, it just doesn't grab so I attached them to the underside of the bumper and even though the bumper is plastic coated it made enough of a surface to pull the straps tight. The bar though resting on the spare tire isn't wide enough to rest only on the tire and will damage the wheel unless you pad it all the way across. I did so with 2 shop towels. Once the rack is on and pulled tight, it was solid and seems well made. It didn't loosen or vibrate and 70mph.."
4,Works great for my Jeep Liberty,"Order this rack and got free shipping which got delivered very quickly. Easy to install and have no issue with it. It is very easy to put my bike on. The small issue I have is that I have an XS size bike, so the frame is quite small and can only fit in the first slot.Keep that in mind if you have smaller bike.But oveall, it works very well."
4,Solid Item ** Good Quality,"This bike rack is very nicely made. Easy to install. Looks attractive on back of vehicle. Fits my Tracker perfectly and snugly. The only negative thing I would say would be to improve the paint used on the Allen name on the rack, it is already starting to fade, which makes the rack look older than it should."
1,Damages wheel,"Works as advertised but scratched up the wheel I mounted it on very badly. I have a 2008 Wrangler with the upgraded alloy wheels. The bottom of the rack sits directly on the wheel, its metal on metal. I probably should have noticed this when I installed it but I followed the directions and removed the tire cover. The vibration of the rack against the wheel while driving etched the wheel very badly and wore the paint off the bottom of the rack. There was nothing in the instructions that warned of this possibility. I destroyed a $600 wheel. I would not recommend this rack for the Wrangler or any other vehicle with a large diameter wheel."
1,bad design,"This bike rake might be great for cars, but does not work for Fifth wheel RV's. The first time I used it, it fell off the spare tire and both of my bikes were damaged. The second time I lashed the carrier to the spare tire with extra straps and it still would not stay on the tire and slipped off.The problem is that the RV tire is BIG and the carrier does not fit it right. There are no ajustment for the on the carrier to make it fit different size tires. Plus there is a some shaking of the tire and that didn't help it either.Even though this carrier has a great review and I did read them all before I purchased it, it is not designed for RV's and that was not in any of the reviews.Roger Yarter"
1,Does NOT fit Toyota RAV 4!,"Despite the claim of the manufacturer, this item does definitely not fit a recent model RAV4. We have a 2010 RAV4. The spare tire fits very close to the body and in fact is nicely nestled into the contour of the rear door. There is no clearance between the tire and the bodywork to allow the upper ""hook"" portion of the rack to grip the tire. Also, the rear window wiper is in the way. If we had forced the rack to fit the tire, it would have either rested all of its weight on the wiper arm, or, to avoid this, the rack could be mounted at an angle and put all of its weight on a very small point on the rear door with resulting paint damage. Either way the rack would not fully engage the tire due to the lack of clearance and there would be a real risk of it falling off. Don't buy this rack if you have a RAV4. I really don't see how any rack hooking over the top of the tire would work on a RAV."
4,Love the product! Need to improve on the packaging.,"I got this for my Honda CRV. Fits well & very easy to install. I was hoping to use it without taking off the plastic spare tire cover by wrapping cloth at the horizotal contact to the spare tire. It did not work...the small top metal cross pieces still stratched the spare tire cover. Hence, I still need to remove the tire cover.Overall, very great product. I love it...work with two TREK bikes. Have to agree with many folks here. Really bad packaging!!! When arrived, the box was full of holes."
1,BAD CHOICE!!!,"I have a Jeep Liberty and purchased this rack based on reviews I read on this site. WELL, I did buy additional bungie cords to secure this rack which did not seem sturdy to me at all to begin with.With that said my $500.00 Trek fell off the rack while I was driving on the highway. $150.00 in damages!!! THIS BIKE WAS A HORRIBLE CHOICE TO SAY THE LEAST!"
5,load on and go,"this rack is very sturdy and stays in place. it's easy to put on and is worth buying. the holders that hold the bikes in place are made well with a flexable soft plastic and held with straps that hold securely and won't rub the paint off your bike, not like others made of flimsy foam or other cheap material. I highly recommend this bike rack."
3,spare tire bike rack,Installed easily onto my spare tire. The individual bike straps have to be threaded and unthreaded with each use. Do not like the way the straps are tightened-you have to pull straps away from yourself. As a small woman I could get them much tighter if I could pull them to me. I also found they did not stay tight. I liked that I could turn the individual mounts to the side for easier loading of the first two bikes.
1,does not work on a 2000 Toyota Rav 4,It says it works on a 2000 Rav4 but it really does not work. The rear wiper prevents a proper fit and the hooks for the bottom two straps only have the rear door plastic molding to attach to (the plastic is just not strong enough). Return the unit and amazon provided a refund that included the return shipping cost which was very nice of the folks at amazon!! so now i will try the bolt on type of rack.
1,Not even a glimpse of what the picture shows,"I am so disappointed, the picks look like they ran out of ink and did not care for what the costumer would think about it. Or did you guys send me used picks?.SpurSumatra's review is very accurate but i still bought them and I regret it. I do not recommend anyone to buy these, save your money and time."
4,Nice kit PLS READ,"Just to get this out of way first, this does not work on aluminum or stainless! I got this kit to refinish my old Mossberg 500AT G series. Got all of the smaller components done so far and it looks great. Thankfully I read the manual from front to back and in the ""trouble shooting"" section one of the troubles is ""The metal does not blue"" and the solution is that the liquid and the paste neither work on aluminum or stainless. Glad I read this before I stripped my receiver because it doesn't warn you anywhere else about that.As for where it does work thought, it was a fairly quick process and looks good. Not great, but good. The kit does not come with everything you need though. You will also need steel wool and sandpaper. So all and all -1 star for no warning of where it wont work and being short a couple of materials."
2,not pure xylitol,"Unfortunately, the description tells you all the things that are not in it, except one. SILICA. I purchased this to use as a nasal/sinus rinse, as recommended by my allergist. According to their description of it, it was free of all sorts of additives. Well, not SILICA. Silica is not something I want to ingest, food grade or not. PERIOD."
4,i like this cd player,"I have had this cd player for about a year, using it in my car and my daughter borrows it, and we do not have problems with it that have been brought up in earlier reviews. I do agree that if you turn it off, it does go back to the track that it was on when it was turned off, sometimes even with a new cd in but we deal with that little quirk. It does great in the car, with long trips. Better than other players I have used. I have been happy with the purchase of it. I actually paid more as I bought it elsewhere so the price you see here is a steal compared to what I paid."
3,Not so bad...,"Well, I've had a chance to listen to the CD and I must say that I have to agree with the last reviewer who reviewed the album. It sounds almost exactly like Icon of Coil, but I've noticed in some songs it sounds exactly like Spektralized. Either way, to me it sounds like a Various Artists CD that only contains Spektralized and Icon of Coil. Seriously, it really does...to me. However, if you're a fan of both bands, than you'll like it. I'm sure of it. Though, I can't deny that I liked the album. Just so at least I know that it's not always Andy from IOC singing in a similar background of music."
5,June,I love it. I live in the south & it is just like how I grew up. It's a great cast. Hope it come back for another season or more.
4,A must for women over 35!,"I know this show was probably created for the typical teenybopper CW audience and no, I am not their audience but I decided to check it out anyway. I was surprised by how light, funny and charming this show is! It doesn't make you think or teach you anything but pair this show with a glass of wine and a carton of Chinese food and it is the perfect antidote to a crappy week for the professional woman.This show will make you smile and have you rooting for Zoey as she tries to navigate life in a small southern town and deal with the attentions of the perfect man (George - he is my pick for Zoey) and the hot but destined to go nowhere bad boy (Wade). If you like chick lit or romantic comedies then you will love Hart of Dixie!"
3,HAGGARD BLOW THERION AWAY,"I WROTE A REVIEW AS MR. GRAVES, ANY WAY I GOT REAL BORED WITH THIS THERION CD AFTER A FEW LISTENS . THIS BAND HAGGARD MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THERION, BUT THEY'VE TOTALLY TAKEN THE BALL AND WILL SOON BE THE NEW KINGS OF SYMPHONIC EPIC METAL. SADLY AMAZON DOESN'T SEEM TO CARRY ANY HAGGARD CDS ALTHOUGH THE GERMAN AMAZON DOES.HAGGARD HAS 3 FULL LENGTH CDS1. ""AND THOU SHALT TRUST THE SEER"" ON LAST EPISODE RECORDS2. ""AWAKENING THE CENTURIES"" ON DRAKKAR RECORDS3. ""EPPUR SI MUONE"" ON DRAKKAR RECORDSONCE YOU BUY ONE HAGGARD CD IT WILL MAKE EVEYTHING THERION EVER DID OBSOLETE SORRY THERION."
4,A Story Worth Listening To...,"This is a very good book. Ms. McMillan has researched it carefully and diligently included Marina's views on Lee and their relationship. The reader gains by seeing inside the mind of a determined assassin. It fails in terms of an over-emphasis on the psychological makeup of Lee Harvey Oswald and in the memories of Marina that occasionally conflict with the facts of the case. It is, nonetheless, a worthwhile read (unless you believe in multiple gunmen, CIA hit men and space aliens on the grassy knoll).It is definitely a well written book."
3,A couple good songs,"I just bought this CD for a road trip to Michigan and I was somewhat disappointed with it. It's only got 6 tracks plus a bonus track and the CD is only 28 minutes long. The Road Behind is the best Gwar song in my opinion but other than that, the songs were kinda lackluster. I expected more from Gwar.BUY IT USED!!!"
3,"Juan, we know you can do better...","I've seen Juan spin live. And I have this disc. The similarity here is that he did use some of these tracks when he spun. The dissimilarity is that, on this release, the first 1/3rd of it seems like just one stumble after another. It's great to hear some of the real Detroit classics, 'tis true. But this is sloppy in a number of places, as you can hear tracks sliding against each other. And I could do without that dog of a track ""Sharevari"", which is just a bunch of cheeze. At least you _can_ tell that this was done with a pair of decks, as opposed to some 'mix CDs' by a few certain DJs of note where you just know there was a copy of Pro Tools gettin' major busy. Still, even though the opening is lame, skip on down a track or two past ""Sharevari"" and get into the real meat of this disc, and you'll feel better about having picked it up."
3,What a disappointment.....,"""~Despite Juan Atkins being one of the founding fathers of Detroit techno, I was totally disgusted him props for being a true techno godfather and pioneer."
3,Other World,This book has not changed since the first time I read it under it's previous titles. Everytime I buy a book and discover it is a reprint with a new title I become very angry. The story(s) are excellent and something everyone should be very aware of. As usual Mercedes Lackey does a marvelous job. I only wish her publishers were more ethical in their business practices.
4,"Yes, it's a reprint, but it's still good!","This is a reprint of two of the SERRAted Edge novels. I can't remember the names of the two right off, but one is where the little boy is kidnapped by his father who is a cult member. The second is about the little girl who is sexually abused (iir, by her father). Even though this is a reprint of those two books, I would suggest it anyway for anyone who likes Mercedes Lackey. I know I have enjoyed it, even though I also already own the two original books!"
3,Sophia Spike Angel heels,"These shoes are very pretty on your feet, but extremely hard to walk in!! I didn't like the buckle on the straps either. I ended up returning these to Spike Angel. They are great about returns and refund you quickly. They also ship items lightening fast and in great packaging. If high heels are your thing, these are super hot!"
1,Waste of time and money,"Re-did my attic and knew for a fact there were beams about a foot apart. Had to attach something to do the wall and rather than pulling off the wooden panels, I bought the Multiscanner to find the beams. Spent an hour yesterday and another hour today and the Zircon picked up one beam, but when I went over it again it read nothing. I scanned back and forth and you would think there was only one beam. Finally got fed up and decided to read the Amazon reviews. Well, just as I suspected, this unit's a dud.Will read other reviews to find something that works."
1,fits nicely but muffles sound!,"The case fits nicely and gives you relatively easy access to all the controls however, you will not be able to hear much through the plastic and whomever you are talking to will not be able to hear you very well. Pass on this case if you want to actually use your phone."
4,Ideal recording of a thought-provoking show,"""See What I Wanna See"" marks a pivotal moment in the career of composing Michael John LaChiusa in that his music and lyrics brings out the emotion that some of his naysayer allege he lacks in past compositions. This show is all about points of view and the CD gives the listener a good foundation of what the Public Theatre production was about. There are some great vocal stylings on this, too- Marc Kudisch, Mary Testa, Idina Menzel, Aaron Lohr and Henry Stram all provide great voices and deep feelings in each of the multiple characters they portray.The only reason I knocked off one star was I felt like there should be a more complete recording, including all the underscoring and dialogue. But that's just being nit-picky. Buy this, you'll love it!"
3,Great info in a bargain-basement format,"Anyone who's familiar with Wendy Knit's popular blog will know exactly what they're getting from this book. What disappointed me was the quality of the book, and the pattern choices. With the number of gorgeous, full-color knitting books on the store shelves, this one definitely pales in comparison. The photos of the finished objects are in black-and-white, and are so dark they're hard to see any detail. Add to that the fact that the patterns themselves are rather bland and blah, and you may want to think twice before purchasing this book. But if you love Wendy (and who doesn't??) go ahead. Then write to her publisher and tell her you want the next book to include color photos. I'd glady pay a few more bucks for a better-quality book."
5,From one Leola to another,I found this book because my name is also Leola. I was so excited to see something that shared my name I had to buy it. The frist thing i noticed apon receiving the book was the beautiful pictures. This will be a book that your children want to read over and over again!
5,Don't buy Pokemon games. Buy Magi-Nation.,"This game is excellent! If you just got out of Pokemon(like me) or your just looking for a good Game Boy game, get Magi-Nation. It's like The Legend of Zelda games mixed with Pokemon. This game(to me) is for kids(or people) ages 8-30. This game isn't to coplicated( like Zelda) or to childish(like Pokemon) but is kind of in between. The part I liked best was the roleplaying. If your a kid, beg your parents for this game. If your a teenager, save up $... and get it. If you are an adult looking for your kid a new GB game, get it for them. If you like Collectible Card Games, play the Dragon Ball Z CCG."
5,very fun game but don't buy it if you only have a gba only!!,u must have a game boy color to play this game i put it in my gba and it was all dark and i couldn't see a thing good thing i have a gbc. thats all other than that the best gbc game every played.
1,Nimpahlavi Guzideh!,"The title of winds of Change, or nimpahlavi guzideh, says every thing.. This is history in the making for 24 years since the revolution that sent the Pahlavis into exile."
4,A look at marine animals in captivity.,"Although it has been several years since I read this book, it made a lasting impression on how I feel towards captivity of marine and other non-domestic animals. In addition, it opened my eyes to animal neglect and, by my defination, cruelty. For those that love animals, it's worth finding!"
2,Reports of My Death are highly exagerated!,"My summary about sums it up. If you want to now everything about Karl Shapiro's later days, this is the book for you. It is not one I would recommend for doing essays or reports."
4,This is the kind of drill your Grandfather would buy.,"This is a great drill, tons of power and a fast 3,000 rpm. No, this is not the same drill they sell at Lowe's. We use these in production, drilling hole after hole, never a problem or hesitation. This drill also has a great power to RPM ratio (9 amp/ 3,000 RPM) I can't find another drill,that comes close. I also needed the keyed chuck and it to be corded as these are used for extended periods. Battery units do not last long enough and keyless chucks eventually break. Very nice package."
5,"If you don't like this album, you don't like hip hop!",One of the four Nice & Smooth albums. This may be the best one. I grew up on this so Im giving it 5 stars!
4,Variety is the Spice of Music,What a delicious CD. Lovely vocals from a truly talented artist. The CD highlights a range of talents which were surprising and refreshing. A good addition to any collection.
3,Great gift idea,"I bought this for my nephew's 7th birthday and he got such a kick out of it! The monster burps (belches, really) when you pull the pencil out of the sharpener. Very cute. I'm wondering how long it will last though.My only complaint is that it requires 4 AA batteries and if you give it as a gift, the recipient will want to use it right away and the battery compartment is a little tough to open (needs tiny phillips head screwdriver).Great for the home, but wouldn't recommend it for the classroom because we don't need to be encouraging our children to belch in class. Just my opinion, though."
1,Confusing,"This movie is one of the most confusing and boring movies I've seen.By the end of the movie your left with alot of questions and not many answers.The movie is not that long but it felt like it dragged on forever.I only stuck it through for Andy Lau.I'ts worth seeing it for free if your a Andy Lau fan and if you've already seen most of his other movies,otherwise I can't recommend it."
4,"Great Idea, Poorly Proofread","There are many books designed to teach rapid calculation without aid of a machine. The topic that sets this one apart, and the entire reason I bought it is that it covers logarithms. Unlike most of the books in this genre this one does not waste space with endless examples and practice problems, anybody can create there own. It does back an impressive array of methods to increase speed in pencil and paper calculation, and makes it clear that each method has a time and place for maximal performance.This book was well thought out, but unfortunately not well proofread. For example, pp 14 and 15 have the following mistakes:""125 x n = 8n,000 / 8"" should read ""125 x n = n,000 / 8""""37 can be represented as 111/4"" should read ""37 can be represented as 111/3""The typos caused me to verify every method presented, but could lead unsuspecting travelers down the wrong path.BOTTOM LINE: This books is a wonderful treasury of number sense that is riddled with typos."
1,no EZ lock wheel!,"After ordering, I discovered it does not come with the EZ lock wheel as advertised. DO NOT BUY, the basic cutting disks are better bought separately."
3,Aveda hair conditioner,"This Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Clay Conditioner was so good for my hair. I only gave it 3-stars because it did not give my fine, shoulder length hair very much volume. A very good product which would probably work well for someone with thicker hair."
4,Keys to the kingdom...,"This is one of the best, most practical books I have read in years. (I'm just over 35 so I assume it is ""for me"") Whether you agree with Gail Evans' perception of the corporate environment or not she does give good, practical advise on how to keep in the forfront and maintain upward momentum in Corporate America.I, personally, could not fathom how I could be doing the same job as my male counterparts at a far better performance level, but yet see each and every one of them continue on their ""career track"" while I was totally stalled. The answer was not (only) a needed change in the corporate culture, but a change in my behavior as well!This book is definitely for women who have tenure in the corporate environment where the ""good 'ol boys network"" is still alive and thriving, as well as those (under 35) just striking out on any venture -- corporate or independent."
4,worth the money,"I applied the principle mentioned in this book and it worked! I conjured up my courage and asked my superior that I want to do a certain task. I was not sure if I can do it, but this book seems to have pushed my back. And he said ""OK"". This book changed my life. Thanks a lot."
3,Okay for the price,"These wedges are nice enough in how they look, and the material is respectable... but they shape of the front is a bit funny, and if you have normal sized toes (not short sausage ones) they will jam into the slits and pinch a bit. Otherwise, they're nice."
2,Noooooo!!!,"""Archangel"" is one of my favorite movies, but it's been changed for this collection. Two of the best scenes (rabbits in the trenches and attack of the huns) have been color-tinted. In other words, instead of Maddin's beautiful black and white, they are blue or red and white. It looks awful. New intertitle cards have also been added. Most of them try to make the story easier to follow, but too many of them try to be funny but fail. ""Twilight"" is Maddin's worst film, a failed experiment, but ""Heart of the World"" is one of his best. The commentaries are amusing, but you're not going to learn anything about the films from them. Maybe someday Criterion will release ""Archangel"" as it originally was."
2,Very Depressing,"Not a story that I enjoyed. It's too much like real life. I can read that in the paper any day. I want to be entertained when I read, not depressed."
3,Could have been better,"The Sacrifice was the first book by Robert Whitlow I've read. I don't normally read Christian fiction, and this book lived up to my expectations. It had the potential to be a great work, but I feel that Whitlow was hindered because of the whole Christian publishing machine, where very few perish and most end up redeemed by the last page. I wish real life were like that. The author accurately describes life in a small Southern town, and he gets kudos for exploring the Christian taboo subjects of dating and divorce. The characters are fairly believeable, but I would have enjoyed discovering more about the first sacrifice in Scott's life than the intricacies of the arm rowing machine. I just wish Christian writers felt free to accurately portray real life. Until they do, I'll stay out of the Christian fiction secton."
5,Whitlow Does it Again!,"Robert Whitlow is such a great writer. This is his best work so far. Our family has enjoyed his other books, The Trial and The List. This is a real page turner.The Sacrifice is a story that keeps you on the edge of your chair. I can't recommend it more highly and our entire family looks forward to more great writing from Whitlow."
5,Standing in the Gap,"I believe everyone who has school-aged children (or teaches them) should read this book. Columbine in all its tragedy opened a Pandora's box, and The Sacrifice holds the key to resolving some of the issues. I have also read The List and The Trial, but I think The Sacrifice has the potential for even greater, more practical encouragement. I also highly recommend Whitlow's other two novels if you haven't already read them - he is my favorite author!"
1,Beware Before Purchase,"The Kaplan software for this book is over two years old. Quicktime suppled on the CD is version 2.x from 1996. The software will NOT RUN on a stock Dell that is six months old.The software also does not run with the current verion of Quicktime.Given the age of the software and its inability to run on a current machine with Windows 98, this is not worth the premium for the CD. And given that the CD has not been updated sinc mid 1998, I would question the book it comes with also."
1,This book had more errors than Chuck Knoblauch on a bad day.,I'm beginning to think that all these books are a waste of time. At least the store gave me my money back.
4,"Good prep course, tests are unrealistically difficult","Overall the book/CD-ROM educate you on the format of the test and what will be covered. The CD-ROM tests function almost exactly like the actual exam. The only difference is that the Kaplan tests are significantly more difficult than the real exam. I took three of the Kaplan tests and scored about the same each time. I scored over 100 points higher on the real test, with plenty of time to spare on each section."
3,"Great series, but a bit ""ghostly""","This is one of the funniest Scooby series to date. I enjoyed it years ago, and it's still funny today. It should get 5 stars from me now, except for the ""ghostly"" images I see onscreen. You see, Warner didn't take the time to remaster these, kind of like the old Scooby series. It had a lot of whiteness in it, adding an afterimage to some of the characters. Plus, the series itself is closed-captioned for the hearing impaired, but not the chase or theme songs. Kind of strange. If you can look past that, then the series is really fun to watch. It's nice to see where the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency got their start and how much the characters have changed over the years as you watch them today. What I would have liked to see is how they all met. That would be interesting. Give this series a try if you're a Scooby fan. You'll like it!"
3,READ,"These picks that come with this package are not as good as they seem. Every single pick is faded and look nothing like they do in the photo. Although the picks do resemble the picture the slightest bit. These picks are good quality picks if you want a regular, plain, hard, pick. If you are getting these picks because you want the cool design on the picks i would not recommend getting these. If you do want some good quality, cheap guitar picks then you should buy this."
2,Misleading Title Left Me Disapointed,"My child is allergic to nuts, which is certainly a common allegen. I was very disappointed to find nearly all of the baked goods recipes contain nuts. I did, however, find the general information in the first chapters to be helpful."
5,Kentt Anderson is a genius.,"Anderson has the rare ability to record some of his true feelings in a format where people can relate and not think of him as a rambling lunatic, but as a human being thrust into a maelstom of war and personal discovery."
3,Please don't compare this with The Alienist,"To start, I liked this book, but not as much as I hoped to like it. It is a nice historical mystery, but it is not in the league of The Alienist, a work to which it is often compared. The narrator, Tom Redmond, is a likeable character, but just as he is confused with the many characters in this mystery, so is the reader.The story searches for the Morton Street Slasher, but the reader who wants a plot similar to the Alienist (which follows the trail of the killer) will be disappointed to learn that this book is more about mining and railroad politics than the search for a killer. If you are interested in the backroom politics of San Francisco in the 1870's or really love the wit of Ambrose Bierce, then you'll probably love this book ... if you're like me, and you like Ambrose Bierce's dark humor but could do without the smoke-filled rooms, then you'll just find it an interesting diversion."
5,ROLLING STONES BASIC HISTORY,This 3 DVD set gave me so much extra info on the ROLLING STONES I never knew. I've been a fan since '64' and continue to be so. You can't go wrong hear if you need or want Stones History.
4,Same Only Different,Just be careful about trying to draw comparisons to...see what I mean. This collection of tracks has it's own title. O.K.?
4,For Your Information,"Please be aware that this video was released in 2001 under the title ""Denise Austin-Shortcuts-Abs"" just in case you already own the original and you thought this one was different. Reviewer comments are also logged under the original title."
3,Good book,"This book was overall a good book, but certainly has room for improvement. More gunfights would make it a more fast-paced book. But an applaude goes out to Matt Braun."
2,not my favorite Madeline Brent,"Having just read the absolutely wonderful ""Golden Urchin"", I am now making my way through Madeline Brent's novels. This one was OK but definitely not the best. Our hero Nate was not as well drawn as the typical Madeline Brent hero. Good mystery though and engaging plucky heroine. The romance part was blah."
2,Bomber look faded with in days,"Love the part that they are uggs. Comfy and warm. Don't waist your time the the ""Bomber"" look though. I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the ""Bomber"". Bummer for me, because I loved the look."
1,not sure this is a reputable business,If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free. I felt this was a shady business. It took forever to get the boots and to return them. I have to return again for a refund. I am hoping this is a fast process. I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time. I would never buy from them again.
2,Made in China,"For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you, as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for, this is not a top end elegant product,it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time, years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it, now it's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity. Thats my opinion and I'm stuck with it."
5,Great boots,My daughter wanted Uggs for Christmas and chose the grey colored tall boots. She wears them often and is very happy - she smiles each time she puts them on. Quality product.
5,Ordered for wifey and 2+ years later still great,Gift to wife and she loves them. I ordered them in 2010 and here I am in 2012 and she still wears them constantly. They hold up really well. definitely recommend.
4,Nice color but could be taller,I like the color. It's not a common color - different but understated. Just wished that the bottom of the shoe could be more ergonoic and the shaft could be taller. Where it hits is not flattering to a woman.
2,Don't purchase these boots....,"if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots. These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles. If you purchase these for $179, you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality. If you do purchase these, the size runs fine, so keep to your same true shoe size, you can wear them without socks and be very warm, just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house; my feet don't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks; I have worn them since mid December. They are light and not heavy. They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them."
5,"comfy,cozy & light","This is the first time buying Uggs! Now I realize why style & comfort combine when wearing Uggs. These cozy, lightweight warm boots are a real treat & great to wear with skinny jeans & leggings. I'll just apply the right treatment for weatherproofing these gorgeous chocolate brown Uggs! Real nice Xmas present to myself!!!"
4,wow,"I HATE SCI FI STUFF, BUT OUT OF DESPERATION I READ THIS AND IT BLEW ME AWAY, IT REALLY MAKES YOU QUESTION THE EXISTANCE OF GOD AS WE KNOW IT. VERY INNOVATIVE AND IMAGINATIVE."
5,Hmm......,"Simply put, this is one of my favorite albums from back in the day. Im 29, still a favorate, still puts a smile on my face. THis is a really good, fun and simple album. Might be to simple for some. (2min ""pop"")good voice, good beats."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,"It's an interview. I thought I was buying something that would actually ""teach"" me something. The copyright date is 2008, but what it should say is ""I got taken out of a clip from the 70's."" I'd like to get my money back- but I guess I should be more careful with my purchases. Buyers beware!!!!! Don't make the same mistake I made."
2,It wasnt a complete waste but wouldn't recommend it,I got this not reading the other reviews and I wish I had. I have recenlty got the idea to try to make some of my own halloween props and thought this would help me. Insted it was about an hour lon interview shot sometime in the 80's with scenes from movies he had shot up til that point. It doesn't really teach you anything and the stuff that they do show is probably long since out dated. The only plus side I found in this is that I can get him to sign the cover when I go to a horror convention in a couple months. I hope this helps future buyers of this item
2,NOT ENOUGH JULIET,"This DVD needs to ditch Devon(nasty pornstar)and Tera Patrick(another pornstar)and get better models. Juliet Cariaga is the only reason I bought this and she only is given 2 scenes which are rather tame. Pet Of The Year 2000 Winner blows this DVD out of the water,so if you are impessed with Juliet's beauty pickup POTY 2000 Winner she has 4 scenes and shows off her body a lot more. Also whats going on with Devon splitting,is that some kind bad pornstar habit? NOT VERY GOOD FLICK UNLESS YOU HAVE TO SEE THE 2 SCENES WITH JULIET (P.S. JULIET LOOKS GOOD ON THE COVER BUT SEXIER ON POTY 2000 WINNER COVER)"
4,Quilting help,I just received the book and look forward to using it as a guide to begin my first quilt
2,Not all that I had hoped,"This book has a lot of good ideas and information in it, but a lot of it is crap. I can see where the warrior diet would be good for short-term usage, but not as a way of life. I wouldn't call myself a bodybuilder per se, but I do have a somewhat muscular physique. However, there is no way I would be able to maintain my size with this diet and workout routine. A lot of useful information and a few good theories, but it's not for everyone. I can understand if women like it. Most women don't care about muscle(unfortunately). If you do, be prepared to lose some of it when you stay on this diet."
2,"Far from perfect, but not bad at all","I stuck with this diet for 16 months before going back to the ""Fit for Life"" diet. Ori gives a logical regimen for daily consumption. Basicly during the day you do not eat anything (if you must, you can eat berries or a few other items) and upon the evening can eat many meals as long as they are protein based, and have a high water content. This diet is not far from Diamonds ""Fit for Life"" which is geared towards living a long healthy life, as opposed to the Warrior diet which is based more on ""getting cut"" (Lean) and being more alert due to the hunger. On the Warrior Diet I lost close to 14 pounds of fat, however, I also lost close to 12 pounds of muscle. This is a diet strategy for those who want to be lean, and don't mind losing some muscle, and it's not a bad read either."
2,Condensed Reprint,"I'm familiar with most of MZB's Darkover books. Looks like a condensed reprint of Planet Savers/Sword of Aldones 1965. Wouldn't have bought again, as have the original."
5,great,Very grateful to find this movie. It's a replacement for Native American collection in our tribal library. It's nice to save money wherever possible.
1,So much for that...,"Mort0mer here, 3 years later. How naive I was! Despite my best efforts, allowing my bi husband to have sex with other men, and tolerating the gay porn, it didn't work. The only relevance this book has to the real world is if you are willing to either completely give up sex with your mate OR if you are willing to go out and take another, straight lover. In either case, you might as well give up before you get too hurt. Trust me, it can't work. So, Ladies, do yourself a favor -- forget buying this book and save your money for your divorce attorney."
1,A waste of money!,"This DVD was poorly produced and I was very disappointed. Although I love to hear Juanita Bynum speak, I would not recommend this one to anyone."
1,Mysterious killer with an axe.,"Antonio Sabato Jr is the best actor in this film. It has a really stupid plot and ending. It's about a killer with an axe that offs his victims one by one. The motive behind this is that the spiky haired kid in this film is mistreated by all his classmates for his weird seance's and evil cults. His behavior is so strange that he makes the guidance counselor very nervous. After getting run off the road by one of his schoolmates, all his old classmates die one by one by this mysterious killer. While in the meanwhile, Antonio Sabato Jr (the detective) in this movie investigates and does a polygraph on everyone. There is not that much gore or nudity in this film and the ending was very bizarre. It was completely stupid."
3,Not a thing sexy about it,"Alright, I have verve 1 and love it due to the cool lounge feeling it brings about. But this is way out there. Too happy or something, teenage bop. The only song on it that I could listen to over and over again is the Billy Holiday ""Speak Low"". Verve producers: keep it to smooth, sultry jazz with the sexier women and men of jazz for the next one (please)."
5,Decide Which Camp You're In Before You Buy,"One thing that you the potential buyer need to decide before you buy this album is how much reverence you hold for the original versions of these songs. If you feel that the originals are nearly holy and should be left untouched, then for God's sake, don't buy this album. You'll only hear blasphemy.If however you are like me and have both a deep love for jazz as well as modern electronica, then give this album a try. Its reinterpretation of the original melds the two genres often with fantastic results. I have played this CD over and over again and each time find new and deeper layers. Most importantly it had renewed my love affair with the original versions.Why not give it a try?"
1,Lost the plot,"Listen up you people producing these Verve Remix CD's, the only enjoyable CD was the first one. Numbers 2 and 3 are mediocre to say the least. Stick to the formula as in the first CD and you will have more satisfied listeners and more purchases."
3,Just not the same,"Although there are a couple of excellent cuts on this cd (Come Dance With Me puts a smile on my face each time.. the jovial manor in which it is sung can't help but make you smile and chuckle along with him as he croons), this cd still lacks the consistance of its 2 predecessors. So although recommended, the first two cds are definately necessities and will be oft listened too whereas this one only makes its ways into the cd player on sparse occasions and usually only certain tracks may be played."
1,this one stank,THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME TO WATCH. I WISH I COULD HAVE 90 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK.
5,Great For The New Investor,I learned something from EVERY chapter. This is a MUST book for the new investor. It all makese sense here! I didn't care about the spelling. You know what the author is trying to say.
2,Woefully Lacking,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It is full of grammatical, syntactical and spelling errors (for example, ""a lot"" is spelled as ""allot"" throughout the book). As far as the subject matter goes, it does an injustice to the word ""investing."" It would have been better to label it speculating or gambling. Even the late Al Frank, who based his stock buying on fundamental value, insisted on referring to the stock market as speculating. In any case, this book suffers from a classic case of confusing brains with a bull market. From 1995-2000, anyone could have ""succeeded"" in the stock market regardless of what market capitalization one decided to ""play."" Neither this book, nor most others on the subject, are particularly useful in knowing how best to ""invest"" in penny stocks over the long run."
3,Purchased it for the maintenance section which is lacking,"Nice history and overview of the rifles development, but weak on assembly instruction, maintenance, cleaning etc. A nice historical reference book really."
2,Needs or Wants to know?,"If you are interested in a long detailed history of the rifle and the grenade launcher variant, then you will like this book, as about 200 of 300 pages are devoted to these topics. If you are interested in care, maintenance and accessories, look elsewhere."
4,Don't use it on dark brown hair or it will tint your hair orange,"I used Sun In for my dark brown hair even though it wasn't recommended on the product instructions. I got a lighter,shiny but slightly reddish orange tint to my hair. After doing some research I decided to try the Alveda Black Melva shampoo and conditioner. It was amazing! after washing and conditioning one time my brown hair color was back to normal with a little extra shine. The only drawback is if you have light blonde or gray hair it ends up with a barely noticeable bluish color to it. My hair has very little gray so that isn't a problem for me. I just washed that streak with regular shampoo a couple of times to remove the blue. am so happy to have my normal color back.The conditioner is the part that actually deposits the color."
2,It takes FOREVER and barely does anything...,"It took me ALL summer just to make my hair a TINY bit lighter. It did bring out all the red and blonde tones by the end, though, but it's not noticeable (none of my friends commented on it until I told them. THEN they noticed.) It also dried up my hair and give me awful split ends. Do NOT recommend this."
5,It's about time!,"I recently purchased this book after a visit to the Alamo. I also had the wonderful opportunity to meet Ms. Ragsdale. This book portrays an aspect of history that is rarely seen. Most Americans learn about the fall of the Alamo in their history classes. However, this is the first time I have had the joy to read about those who were also within the Alamo's walls, the women. These women endured a great catastrophe with honor and grace. It is quite refreshing to be given the opportunity to read about the others who participated in our country's growth and freedom. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American History, Women's Studies or in general. It is a book that moves you and brings you to the Alamo. It helps one to read it and imagine the scenes that were occurring at that point in time. A great read!"
4,VAC,"VAC is consistently dark and moody, but this is perhaps their darkest album. turn off the lights and enjoy at a loud volume. a very good album, and a good indicator of what 'lust for blood' delivered on"
2,Warning - Does not include transformer!,"Be aware that this item does not include a plug and requires the additional purchase of a transformer. Its somewhat ambiguous in the description, and the title states this is a kit, but is actually more like a part! Anyway it caught me off guard."
3,Unfortunate fit,"I was delighted when my new slippers arrived and found them warm and cozy. However the left slipper was significantly larger than the right one, an unfortunate mistake from the manufacturer, I assume. I had hoped to exchange them for another pair in the same size without the error but was given a refund instead. I hope to find a similar item somewhere soon."
5,WIll be a Hit...,"""Just one of the Boys"" is an awesome song and Michelle does a great job with it. The song has a playful feel that suits her. I would roll on the floor in shock if this song does NOT become a #1 hit. I can't wait for the full album to come out!Oh, and if you haven't seen her in person, she is also stunningly beautiful! We'll all want to catch her in concert!Move aside Shania and Faith because here comes Michelle Poe...."
2,Low Expectations Make This a Winner,Don't expect too much and this will be enjoyable. It is not very heavy on history -- greater focus is on Frankfurter's personality -- but it does shed light on some historical events and actions the justice took in his early days.
4,Oops,"I actually bought this CD by accident, but I'm glad I did. Not for casual Rush fans, this album contains some of their more obscure tracks, the ones that didn't get radio airtime. That notwithstanding it's an amazing compilation. If you're a BIG Rush fan then this is for you."
4,"Well Done, as expected",This CD follows the usual Theme-oriented release style that is a hallmark of this group. The tempo and stylistic variations seen throughout the differing tracks continues to demonstrate the range this band is capable of. RUSH has successfully weathered the decades and I look forward to a continued stream of releases following a simmilar theme-oriented release style.
4,Never disappoints,"Tom Jenkinson (aka Squarepusher, and now Chaos AD) never ever disappoints. More crazy electro-maddness on this new album. If you like this, check out some of his works under the Squarepusher name."
5,One of the most under-rated American writers of all time.,"I have little doubt that if Joan Silber were a man, her name would be a household word.Ironically, her first book is actually called Household Words and won a Hemingway Award. Amazingly, but not surprisingly, the first story she submitted for publication was accepted by the New Yorker, yet few people are familiar with her work. I had loved Household Words when I read it in 1980 and thought to look if she had written anything since. That's the only way I would have ever known about her.I brought Lucky Us and Size of the World home from the library and practically read both of them in one sitting. Such vivid writing. Such great characters. She captures the subtleties of everyday life with such understated drama -- the quality of darkness when one is lonely, for example, or the tricks people use to fend off despair.I hope she gets more airplay soon and plan to recommend her to all my friends."
3,Thought it was for a tree,"We have not have much fun because I got the swing for a tree. When I got it home I noticed it was for a swing set. I am not the best handy man or woman, but I am having a terrible time trying to figure out how to mount it to a tree. I have gone to walmart, target, academy and even homedepot, but no one seems to have any kit or even any suggestions of how to do this.I am open to other's suggestions if you would like to send me an email to julie -at- borkowskifamily -dot- com"
3,She's funny,"Parker Posey is one of the most talented actresses I've seen in film comedies. She shines in this movie, but nobody else does. It seems strange to have Freddie Prinsze Jr. and Tori Spelling in a film that looks like it's trying to stay close to its theatrical origin. The script is compelling but unfortunately the performances don't convey the immediacy of a dramatic stage production. I kept watching for the ""deus ex machina"" to lift this from the rut it stays in. I'll watch it again; maybe I'll like it a little more after that. If you like good writing, you may like it despite the co-stars' stiff and one-demensional deliveries."
5,This movie is really really good.,"This is the darkest, funniest comedy that I've seen in a long long time. It is an especially good adaptation from the stage to the screen. I f you like sick, twisted comedy...this movie is for you."
3,Wore out quickly...,"I had this diaper bag for my daughter, and LOVED it, but noticed the elastic pockets on the side got stretched out, then the material started fraying around the edges of the bag, and lastly, the material surrounding the strap tore to the point where fixing it was impossible. All of this happened within a year of buying it brand new. I really loved this bag - cute, fun, and not ""typical"", but after this experience, I would not buy again..."
4,Like liquid food,"I've used this stuff for two years and am pretty happy with it. It tastes pretty bland, especially when the water bottle starts to warm up but I add stevia sweetener to it and that seems to help. I use 2 scoops of Perpetuem for a 24 oz bottle and add two packets of Stevia sweetener. I'm do a lot of century rides and my bike is set up for 5 bottles. I have 4 with Perpetuem and 1 with water. My routine is to drink half a bottle every 11 miles and that takes me to 88. I'll stop at the 50-something mile rest stop, top off two bottles with water, maybe take on some food and move on. If it's not hot, I won't need to take on food. In full disclosure I also use e-gel and down one of those every hour. I've done 17 centuries that way the last two seasons and it works pretty well for me."
2,WORST TASTING SPORTS DRINK EVER!!!,"I used to use Cytomax and heard about Hammer Nutrition, and decided to go with them because they were KOSHER.After researching their 20 different products, I tried out this product in the strawberry flavor.I have to say that it is by far the most disgusting tasting sport drink that I have ever tasted. Also Cytomax really worked, I haven't tried the hammer nutrition as much because it just tastes so bad but it doesn't seem to have the same results.The first time I thought that I didn't use enough powder, no matter what I tried and what I mixed it with, it still tasted horrible.Stay away from this flavor, unless you like the taste of rotten strawberries and mud!"
4,Exactly as ordered!,"Wish they had have shipped it UPS instead of Post Office, it would have gotten here faster. But that's more about the post office. Exactly as ordered though."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this in glossy white to spruce up some old stools...this product worked great! My stools looked like new! There's a lot of paint in one can, and I did not even need to use the second one I bought. Great buy!"
2,HDV owners beware! Drops frames in my Canon HV20,"These work for HDV footage, but I've gotten more dropped frames with this brand of tape than other I've used in the past. I bought Panasonic and Victor HDV tapes (Bought in Japan) and never had problems. But I've had quite a few dropped frames from these sony tapes. A big disappointment."
5,Excellent Quality,I've been using these tapes for a few years now. Together with a Sony camcorder they make a great addition to your video library. The quality has never let me down. I've used it for very special occasions and was 100% sure that the quality will be outstanding.
5,Encylopedia of Music,"It is what it says it is, and Encyclopedia of Music. It seems very complete and it is easy to find information in it. /// WEL"
5,Super nail fungicide,The product worked very well it took about 4 weeks to clear up but it did! a great product!Thank you Amazon.com for getting it to me as soon as you could
2,Reads like a pulp novel,This account of Empress Dowager Cixi reads suspiciously like a scene-by-scene synopsis of a serialized (TV) dramatization of the Empress' life.The's very little in the way of documented fact but lots of melodramatic scenes and made-up dialogue.
5,New cookbook captures Fonda San Miguel's magic,"""Fonda San Miguel: Thirty years of Food and Art"" is no ordinary cookbook. It offers readers a glimpse into the restaurant's unique décor and spectacular traditional Mexican dishes, like huitlacoche. But the cookbook also features Fonda specialties like the Silver Coin Margarita, a watermelon-infused tequila beverage that's perfect for Cinco de Mayo parties and year-round fiestas. Dining at Fonda San Miguel is not simply about a meal, it's about a truly satisfying experience. This book captures everything about Fonda San Miguel that makes it one of Austin's top restaurants."
1,Would not recommend,Format is annoying. Characters are stereotypical and protagonist's strange behavior is poorly explained. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Not.a fan,"I have to be honest, I just couldn't get into this book. It seemed.too childish for me to enjoy. I kept reading it hoping it would get better but it never really did."
4,Wallflower,This book was well written. I had no expectation whenI started reading it but was captivated to continue and glad I did.
2,Easy to read and captivating,But I thought it was a bit contrived. I was hoping for maybe a deeper look into the story than the movie but it almost seems to be the screenplay of the movie word for word. I don't like books like that. Granted I finished the whole book because I did enjoy the movie. The main character cried a lot more than I have ever comfortably read anyone cry in my life. I almost wish I could return this book.
2,"poorly constructed, trite.","It's unsurprising that this is an MTV offering. A little bit too much happens in this novel, from sexual perversion to drugs to abortion and so on and so on and so on. It's one of those books that earnestly tries to have a message, but instead fails miserably."
1,"Awful movie, I'm sure the book is worse","This is 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. I cannot relate to any of this at all. There is nothing good about children getting molested, look what it has done for our tyrannical President. There is nothing good about being homosexual. Most rational people will reject every idea in this book/movie. Don't waste even one second reading this or watching the movie, you will be a lesser person for having done so."
5,thought provoking and amazing,i love this book and im seeing the movie soon. i love the anonymous feel and oh my goodness its just overall great . Charlies vauge outline is so deep and amazing . 5 stars good jobbbb
5,no words can describe,"i'm not going to write a summery of the book. that would be pointless because this books summery did not mean much to me. i loved this book, but not because of the plot. i loved the main charchter, charlie. i loved the way he thought. how simple he was, how much of a 'wallflower' he really was. this book tied up my insides and made me cry. and smile. and i loved it. and you will too."
5,Top Ten Ever,"This book easily finds a place on the list of top ten best books in the latter half of the 20th century. It is astonishing that The Perks of Being a Wall Flower is Chbosky's first novel. My copy has passed through the hands of family members, friends, friends of friends etc. The bittersweet and quiet awakening of Charlie reminds readers to sometimes sit back and enjoy rain, music, life as it happens as opposed to retrospectively. The Perks of Being a Wallflower changed my expectations of novels and changed the way that I read and write... Missing this read is foolish. Read it and revel in the possibility of of youth."
4,Different,"This book is telling the life of a teenager going throw the teenage usual life. He has an older sister and brother. The teen in this book, Charlie, is writeing a letter to someone unknown. When he starts hanging out with Sam and Patrick, they lead him to new adventures. For example: smoking, drinking, ..., getting high, and going to wild parties with sex. If you like this kind of book it will be good for you. The language isn't that good. But if you like books that can prepare you for life in a way that you might face these things, then this book will show you some things about life. But don't be tricked about the book when you first read it, it gets better, and the end is something you would never expect."
4,Still a but confused,I loved the book but I don't really understand some things.... Oh well I suppose the book wouldn't be as great if there wasn't some mystery to it
2,slow and repetitious,The book is to slow and repetitious. The only thing I can compare it to is a bad '70s 'After School Special'.
5,A Superb Coming-of-Age Book for All Ages,"This cult hit is too amazing to describe accurately. The book is written in letters to an anonymous ""friend"", which allows Charlie to tell his life's story without it feeling contrived. The tale of a freshman who doesnt really fit in, befriends seniors, and goes through social anxieties and transformations is true to life. (I am currently a high school freshman, and have seen it all happen.) The best part of this book is how real it seems. With the mention of music, movies, ect. it feels like this kid could be standing next to you explaining all his woes. Suggestion: make a mix tape of the songs mentioned in the book, and read it listening to said tape. Or, at the very least, listen to ""Asleep"" by The Smiths as you start and end the book. It makes the reading experiance even more amazing. I highly recommend this book to every person, whether youre hetero or homosexual, male or female, young or old- I promise that you will fall in love with this book!"
3,"At First I Thought it was great, but then I thought...","I read the whole thing in a span of 2 days. It's a quick and easy read. The characters are interesting at best, but nothing about this book is compelling. At first I was very impressed by this book, but after episode after episode of clichés it became boring. While I was enjoying the first segment, which had a very nice crescendo at the end of Part 1, I learned that the book was published by MTV. The later parts all then made sense because they were simple recyclings of themes and ideas. Overall the book has interesting enough characters to read the whole thing, but after part 1 it just got boring."
2,I was hyped into reading a teen's diary,"...and that's just what this is. Granted, it's nice to see the letters becoming more well written as the story goes on and the character improves, but seriously: this is a teen story. Don't try to read it if you're done with your adolescence."
2,Lack Luster Tale of Childhood,"im not exactly sure what i expected to read when i ordered this book. i suppose i should have known what i was getting into when the topic was ""young adult"". i assume now that this book in poiniant on a lower reading level and i would have enjoyed it more if i wasnt a recent high school graduate. it seemed to me like a older, more explicit version of ""dear mister henshaw"", a kids book for those of you unfamiliar. this book moves slowly and eventually never comes to a point. the child runs rampant with no real remorse. many issues arent explored, ie the realtionship with his teacher and his apparently disjointed family life. all in all, the book was disappointing and left something to be desired.sorry all you 5-star critics. try some classics and youll know exactly where im coming from. for a deeper taste of angst, try ""ordinary people"" and ""catcher in the rye"". thank you."
2,Less than expected,"This book had me turning from page to page, however, it didn't make that much sense to me nor had much interest. I expected a lot more and don't think I would recommend this book."
2,Very strange,This book was hard to follow. Every time I thought I understood it something would happen that was peculiar again. I didn't like the format either. It is laid out as the main character writing letters to someone and he doesn't even know the person
3,ok..........ending left me wanting more...,was a great coming to age story.....but very vague on little details in the story.... the ending was rushed and left too much to the reader to fill in the holesdont want to see the movie now would be a double let down.
5,Must Read,I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie and I am so glad I did. What an amazing and touching story. I loved every minute of it!
3,Very nicely conceived,"I had heard a little something about it and thought that I would have a read of it.However,it was not my cup of tea,an age gap thing.I felt that it was well written and unusualiy set out. It is really designed for a younger reader."
5,Why to read this book,I liked this book a lot it was really good and a touching story. I would recommend it to all of my friends
5,Best book ever.,Literally the best book ever. Words can't explain how much I love it. I recommend it to everyday teenager. Seriously.
1,More teen boy and girl cliches!!!,"I recently slammed another ""coming of age book"" for reverting to silly gendered cliches about teenage girls and boys: girls are self-mutilating suicidal anorexic doormats and boys come in two types: cool druggie pretty effeminate gay boys who are beat up, and mean insensitive football jocks who do the beating up. Never, ever, ever does a girl have confidence or engage in hedonism (drug use) rather than self-inflicted pain (cutting oneself, starving). Nor is a girl ever gay in teen lit--especially not a cool druggie pretty girl. In teen lit, a football player is never gay and an effeminate boy is never straight. Basically, I am so tired of the stereotypes. Sadly enough, this book is wedded to them. You have your cool gay boy, your sad boy narrator, and your Girl He Is In Love With (she has no identity of her own except her romantic trifles). In short, its tired and tiresome, and vastly overrated."
4,The perks of Being a Wallflower,Good and easy read. Kept my interest throughout the whole book. Coming of age story in a different format compared to overcoming of age stories.
5,The perks of being a wallflower,This book was a truly enlightening book it told me a lot about my self and others .being a freshmen in high school my self it really helped me to understand I wasn't the only one with insecurities and fears.
5,love it,this book was amazing. I don't want to give to much away so I recommend to just read it. love it
5,Wow,At first i thought the book was very slow but the more Letterman read from Charlotte more captivated u become. You find yourself cheering for charlie and along side him through his journey. Its an amazing book Anson think everyone under the age of twenty should be required to read it.
4,Left wanting to know more...,This was the first book I read because I wanted to. Not because some english teacher said I had to. A man I work with's daughter was given this book by her school as an assignment and told to read it over the summer. The mother of this girl evidently was reading it and the parents were not happy about their daughter reading this book. They said it was too detailed for their 17 year old daughter. So I looked it up on the internet and bought it to read myself.I think it did it's job as a book. It left me wanting to know more about the boy and at times I couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud yet cried at times. I found myself worrying about him and I really became attached to him. I felt as if I knew him personally. However I do think it is a little too detailed at times for younger readers. Overall I like this book and am glad I read it.Now I want to read more books!
5,Best Book I ever read!,"I don't usually enjoy reading. Most books are long-winded and boring and overrated, but I totally loved The Perks of Being a Wall Flower. In fact, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading a book this much! I actually LOOKED FORWARD TO the time I had alone with the book, and that almost never happens to me. Please check it out. Another short, snappy book I liked: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. I think schools should throw out all those boring ""classics"" and start a brand-new list!"
5,Wonderfull,I really liked this book because it was very relatable yet different The format of letters really allows the reader to get into Charlie's brain and see the world thought his eyes.
4,Such honesty,"This book is fantastically written when it comes to the honest truth. It doesn't fluff a story for the value. It's cut, raw, and real. I couldn't put it down, even stayed up all night to finish it. I learned that maybe we all need to be a wallflower in the right moments and ""participate"" in others."
4,"Ah, high school ...","Written in the form of letters to a person whose identity is never revealed, 'Wallflower' is a fun, engaging and poignant read detailing Charlie's freshman year of high school. As Charlie shares his new social experiences with the reader there are many moments that resonate, and probably any reader, regardless of what one's social status is or may have been in high school can identify with Charlie on some level. One of his more endearing characteristics is his introspectiveness, and this work reminded me of both 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' and 'The Catcher in the Rye.'"
5,Its good,"I haven't read the entire thing yet, but from what I have read it is amazing. I haven't read a book this good for ages, it seems like."
5,Destined to be a classic!,"Excellent, well-written story about a year in the life of a unique yet common 15 year old. The novel, although being a quick read, is a sincerely deep tale of the life experiences of ""Charlie"". His emotional instability is something almost everyone can relate to (although probably not at the high level that Charlie experiences). Chbosky delivers with his unique format, as he pulls you in as if you may be the friend to whom the letters are addressed. Overall, this book is extremely enjoyable, and anyone who attended high school should be able to relate."
4,VERY GOOD,y is it good you may ask yourself??welll continue to read this review-well written-very awesome LIKE A BOSS plot-awesome characters-recomended to read if your at least 14and last but NOT LEASTHAVE YOU SEEN THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS CHARLIE??? -_- hehe
3,The perks of being a wallflower,I loved reading this book from Charlie's point of view. It was amazing to read about the everyday lives of the fictional characters in this story. I wish there was a sequel!
5,Wallflower,Fantastic book. I watched the movie and I knew the book would be even better. I was right!!! It's a brilliant book and I recommend it.
5,In one word? Infinite.,"Going into this book, I was skeptical of how much I would like it or if I would even be able to finish it. But honestly, Charlie is so relatable, remarkable and just straightforward. He doesn't try to hide his imperfections or mistakes,but rather shines a light on what he thought of the situations. To me, this baring of his soul to the reader, that was what made this book epic. When reading it, taking in all the words and emotions of Charlie, you can't help but to feel...in infinite."
3,Great!!,"At first, the beginning was a tad boring so I stopped reading it. But when I picked it back up, I finished reading it in 3 days. Some of the sentence structure and language was a little hard to understand but it was still a great book.I loved this book and I definitely recommend it to everyone and I can't wait to see the movie :)"
4,Very moving and dead on...,"The book, although I was quite shaken by the ""twist"" ending, was still quite right. The feelings of our precocious narrator are very true to life. It does capture high school well. This one shines at times because of it's format and honesty. It will leave you feeling both happy and sad at the same time, which Charlie talks about at one point.I was reminded of two other novels, of the coming of age genre, which fans of this book might like. There is 10th Grade which was released last year and is lighter hearted than this. However, it does a fine job of capturing the lonely days of school...and on a more esoteric note, ""Everything Looks Impressive"" by Hugh Kennedy...which takes place with a freshman in college and a senior he befriends...All worth the read."
4,Not what I expected,Although it was not what I expect I was still presently suprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It was a little darker than I first thought but I think that's what makes this book so interesting.
5,Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I think this book was amazing. It was very real, and very raw. It is a great coming of age story for anyone in high school. I think this should be a required reading for schools across the country. Shed some light on real situations that kids go through every day, and no one even realizes."
4,Best of the genre since Go Ask Alice,"I wish I'd discovered ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" when I was still in high school. The main character is stunningly real and gives an authentic literary voice for millions of young adults. He goes through typical youthful indiscretions without the gloss of so many other stories featuring teens. Its short enough to finish in one read and powerful for readers of all ages."
4,The infinite,A perspective worth considering. This is a well written story of compassion and honesty. A look at how to keep life real without spinning out of control.
5,life of a freshman,"I read this book a while ago, but i was and still am blown away by it. This is the most realistic book i have ever read portraying a freshman year of high school, which i just completed. Whether you are the most popular person or the most shunned outcast, you can relate to Charlie as he tells his mystery receiver about his day to day life.I actually read it right at the end of my freshman year and as i looked back at my freshman year and i was amazed at the honest reality of it. i reccomend it to anyone who *really* wants to know what a freshman year of high school is like."
2,Very over-the top,"The perks of Being a Wallflower is just too melodramatic. The main character (I forget his name), who is basically meant to be some misunderstood genius, is faced with every problem imaginable. Sorry, but i just really didn't like it. Actually, I hate all teen fiction because either it's really superficial or trying to hard to be ""deep."""
2,boring and hard to understand,"i read this book and i know that a lot of people ive spoken to have loved it but i could not grasp the meaning of the entire thing. it seemed dull, and very unrealistic. i thought charlie was mentally disabled for the majority of the book until the end when it is explained. i didn't like the ending either. i thought it was rather cliche and expected. this book just did not do it for me, but i can see where people would enjoy it. if you want to read a slightly more 2002-ish novel on growing up, this would be a good choice. otherwise i recommend you pass it by."
4,Perks,This book was had compelling language that made you want to flip through the book and start all over again
4,Good read,"Read this book before and really enjoyed it, enough to read it again. Just got a Kindle Fire and wanted it as part of my library."
4,A Wonderful Book.,"I read this novel based on a recommendation and was so glad that I did. It deftly captures the anxieties of high school and the less Chbosky dwells on monumental issues, the more the reader feels for Charlie. Very well constructed and a great read."
4,Relatable,Everyone has neurotic tendencies in there youth. This is a really relatable story on so many different levels. A good read.
4,"thought about giving it 5 stars, but...","...need to give it some time. But it's an awfully good book. Sure, the kid is idiotically hyper-sensitive, but it's still a haunting and amazing look at the outcasts of high school society. I've been on both sides of that, and this is pretty dead on. read Notes from Underground next. Think Chbosky read that? You bet."
2,Not what I expected...,"Honestly, I would give this 5 stars however it was just not for me. If you like journal entries, this is perfect. I just am not a fan of rambling nonsense. I like ideas that flow and connect, not jump around."
3,"entertaining, but nothing special","i read this book during a bout of insomnia one night. i found it interesting enough to read and keep me occupied, but i would say there is nothing too special about it. i really liked certain elements of it, it was an enjoyable read, but overall nothing really stuck with me that i didn't feel was just the standard coming of age/ self discovery story. i would definately point out the published by mtv thing. this is the second mtv book i've accidentaly purchased (if i see that they are mtv i won't buy them), and they really are all the same, catcher in the rye, inspired stories."
5,"Fantastic read, couldn't put it down","This book was recommended to me by a ex because of my love of The Smiths, so I dove right in. ReAlly enjoyed the characters"
3,Decent Book,I never read this book in high school / college and had always wanted to. It is a coming of age story that would be great for teenagers and college kids. Not the best read for adults.
1,"Teenagers, for real!","I read this book waiting for something to happen, it never did! There is something wrong with this kid, obviously. Charlie does not exhibit normal, or even semi- normal teenage behavior. It's been a long time since I was a teenager, but things haven't changed that much! This cannot be called ""a coming of age"" story because nobody comes of age this way. Drinking alcohol, doing drugs, exploring sexuality is never given a second thought by any of the young people in this story - which are big issues, instead Charlie focuses on mixed tapes. And honestly, what sixteen year old male, who is given the opportunity to have sex with the girl he loves, would cry and sleep on the couch! The story leaves the reader with many unanswered questions, and I was quite disappointed at the end. Read it, you'll see what I'm talking about!"
4,Yayyyyy,Actually a really good book. I cried. :/ but hey it was a good cry because he was all infinite and it made me sad and happy at the same time...
3,Perks of being a wallflower,"Very confusing. I will have to re-read it to completely understand it. However, I did enjoy reading it although it is difficult."
4,A touching book,"I read Perks and was sincerely touched by the honesty and simplicity of Charlie's message of goodwill. This book has achieved much on its own terms. I don't understand why so many people feel the need to decide right now whether or not it is a ""classic"" or need to compare it to ""Catcher in the Rye"". Did people accuse Salinger of ripping off F. Scott Fitzgerald? Why not just let the book be what it is, a beautiful piece of work that has touched many many hearts."
5,The Book That Changed The Way I Think About Things,"Steven Chbosky's first book, THe Perks Of Being A Wallflower isprobably the best book I've ever read in my life. Before I read thisbook I didn't understand things about life as a teenager as well as I do now. The book is a collection of letters sent by a boy named Charlie to someone he's only heard about. Becouse the book is in a letter format, it makes it very easy to read and is more interesting. I loved this book and so have my friends since it depicts what teen life is really about"
3,"Interesting account of modern day high school, however...","This book was a somewhat interesting account of a modern day high school scenario, however, Charlie is an unrealistic character. It seemed strange to me how such sensitive and emotional freshman appealed to so many seniors and how he quickly became friends with all of them. Also, his redundant crying was out of place. The sad story about his aunt was interesting, though, and his brother and sister as well."
1,"Nothing redeeming, depressing to read","I am not sure what the reviewers saw in this book. It is a depressing read and really do we think that teenagers are dealing with ALL the difficult and tragic aspects of life by the age of 16 at once? If you made a list of all the tragedies in life, then decided to put them all on one character's shoulder this is your book. This poor boy deals with death, suicide, child molestation, rape, abortion, sex, drugs, alcohol, depression, and a variety of mental disorders, while also being a social outcast and having no self esteem. I am astonished that the age for this book is 14, but at any age it is just like watching a bad car accident."
3,Interesting and Quick read,"This diary style novel is structured as a series of letters written from high school freshman Charlie to an anonymous older character. Charlie relays a coming of age tale that examines sex, relationships, and family dynamics through the awkward lens of an ostracized teen. I read the book in one evening and it can relate to mine, if not everyone's, life during those awkward teenage years. I am equally excited to watch the movie that has been made as well. However, I do have some reservations with some of the concepts and themes. At times it was incredibly hard to relate to Charlie. He is a dynamic character but sometimes his eccentricities got in the way of the plot of the book. But, Chbosky wants this novel to be a character study more than anything, so it is understandable. All in all it is a great book for a rainy day stuck at home."
5,This is the best book I have ever read.,This book is awesome. I have never been so fully engaged by a book. The perks of being a wallflower is now my favorite book o all time. The writing style is fresh and wonderful. I felt like I was reading letters from a very old friend whom I have never met. Simply amazing.
3,Cute book ... mostly for kids,"This is a nice book if you're a teenager. Telling the story of a young, high school kid filled with existential angst, who has trouble finding his place among his peers, it's a cute coming-of-age book. Teens will relate to this guy is unsure of himself, ayet still wanting to do good.For adults, it's a quick read, but of little intellectual interest. The use of language, like the story, lacks ingenuity. I've read pieces by college freshman that were better written."
4,Good book,The book was good but not the best. It can be slow at times but they don't last long. If you don't like books that are set up journals then you might not like this book. But it is totally worth reading.
5,Great read!,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was such a great read. The characters are developed very well throughout the story, and it was easy to make a connection with each one. This book had a wonderful balance of humor and raw human emotion. Definitely worth reading!"
5,Amazing read!,"Hands down one of the most touching, raw, and honest stories I've ever read. Definitely going recommend it to all of my friends and family."
3,Decent,"Decent book but the movie was better which is more times than not, not usually the case. Quick read though but not my favorite."
4,Ehh,The book was alright. Nothing special but I think I set my expectations too high because the people that recommended it to me over sold it.
3,Disappointed,After many people encouraging me to read this book Richard. I heard nothing but great things but after reading it myself I am dis as appointed. I do not see what is so great about this book.
2,"Now, I don't even want to see the movie","I did not like this book at all and was actually excited about seeing the movie, until I read it. Now, I don't even want to see it. I disliked the format of it being written as diary-type entries, the topics jumping around and the nature of the topics. It's not often that I find a book I really dislike, but this is definitely one I would not recommend."
4,hipster,Good read. not what i was expecting but a good read overall. i would recommend it as a good light read.
5,LOVE this book,"This book should be a requirement for high school kids. It is such an honest portrayal of life, I love it!"
4,Interesting read...,If you are like me and have no idea how or what teenagers in this generation are thinking then this is the book for you. I liked the fact this book is written as a diary to a person that does not exist but that we all wish would exist. All in all this was an enjoyable read and encompassed many of the issues facing our young adults today.
3,contemporary literature,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a decent book, but I think it was kind of over rated by the other reviewers because it didn't change my outlook on life but it kept me entertained during the time I read it. Charlie was a good character because he is actually believable. Some of the things he does, and the things he deals with can be related to by normal teenagers. I like that this book is realistic as well as imaginative. I like the fact that the characters smoked and drank because i can relate to things like that and it seems realistic, and shows peoples flaws."
3,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,It was a very interesting book. I somewhat enjoyed the diary format of the book. I wouldn't mind seeing the movie.
3,I liked it enough...,I liked it enough but it just felt like the sequel to The Catcher in t he Rye. Easy 2-3 day read.
1,Disappointed,I read this because it has been on the NY Times best seller list. NOT my kind of book. I tried to get into it but had a hard time finishing.
4,Amazing,I choose to rate this a book four stars instead of five because sometimes I felt that it was too repetitive. But that was the only possible thing that I could think of that was bad about this book. It was the most interesting book I have ever read it really made me think. The kind of thinking that requires you to put the book down and think about what you've read and what it means. I would recommend this book to any high school or college student.enjoy
3,The life of a teenager is not what it's cracked up to be,"Even though it's been many years since my teens, I can relate to fitting/not fitting in in High School.The secret at the heart of this novel, though shocking, is not that unusual. Many children are abusedby people they know well and whom no one would suspect.The characters are all out-siders who find each other. The wall flower is a good listener and observer.He does need to be shown that he does fit in some where even if it's Rocky Horror Show."
5,Great read.,"Very good read, well written and completely entertaining. It was very hard to put this book down! The characters and writing effortlessly pulls you into their world and doesn't let go until you've reached the final page."
4,The perk of being a wallflower.,This was a very interesting book very um queer I should say but over all a very good book.good I liked it anyway and I hope the next reader does too
4,Honest book. Recommended :),The book is honest and genuine. It is written in a way that makes you feel you know the character in a personal level.
5,Nostalgic,"Took my back to my high school years. I loved the innocence of Charlie's character, seeing him learning lessons and ""growing up""."
5,AMAZING,"This book is definitly my favorite, without thinking twice!! It's got to be the most hilaiuos book i have read. It took me three hours to read this book, because i could seriuosly not put it down. The reassons why this book is so good, is because in some ways, it will be easy to relate to. The perks of being a wallflower is about a boy who doesn't fit in. his sister has some problems through the book and they evenutally get along. his brother is really popular and is away at college. The boy's name is charlie, and his best friend killed himself. Charlie is having a lot of trouble making friends, when he finally meets three seniors. the whole book is about what charlie experiences in his first year at high school. this book is a MUST READ."
3,not for middle schoolers,I read this as a twelve year old because the movie recently came out and the sample was good. however as I got farther into the book there were details about sex and other things that I had not covered in health class yet. other than that the book was touching and interesting. I would recommend this for people that are older than twelve and are more comfortable with some topics covered in the book.
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed the style of writing, as the author stuck to the premise that it was written by a teenaged boy, complete with choppy sentences and the lack of 'thesaurus' words. It made you root for the kid the whole way through, but the ending left something to be desired. Many questions were left unanswered, although a huge one was hinted at if not explicitly stated if one had been paying attention.It's definitely not a complete 'feel good' story that leaves you smiling when you're done, rather it's more of a rollercoaster of emotions and allows you to ride the highs and lows of that which is a socially awkward teenager's life.I'd recommend it, but not the kind of book you just can't put down or has a high reread value."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I read the sample of this book and thought it was ridiculously stupid, but bought it despite my intuition based on the reviews. I want my time and money back! I read it in less than four hours and regret buying it. I gave it two stars only because one part made me tear up and one part made me laugh, but the rest of the book was a waste. I don't see how anyone could say this is a stunning and life changing story. I honestly thought that he was ""special"" and didn't know it, but the ending describes his weird behavior as caused by something else entirely. I just didn't get it, and I read a lot so I don't misunderstand books very often."
4,Enjoyable,"The writing level is very low and hard to get used to, but the story is powerful and overwhelmingly beautiful. I really appreciated the rare humor found in these pages. You won't regret reading it even if you don't particularly like the story very much."
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"This book was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie now. I loved the characters, especially Charlie. I felt I could relate to him in many ways."
1,My view,"I did not like this book. It just wasnt my style, but thats just me.It was about a kid named charlie who wrote about his daily life. It tells the life of how high scool really is, abot relationships, and friends. The Author dosent hold back anything. I know of a lot of other people who like i, so if it sounds interesting to you, get it."
1,Sucks,"There are so many excellent YA books out there. This is NOT one of them. If the author were a bit more creative, he wouldn't have had to resort to the hackneyed themes of sex, sex, more sex, and drugs, drugs, and more drugs. BORING. Maybe the author thinks it's sensational and exciting - it's not. Give us something new, please! Even better, find another job and stop writing."
1,This is just sick...,"This is just sick!!! The author is trying to deliver a message that homosexuality is a normal thing and needs to be accepted or approved. This book is disgusting, don't ever read it unless you want to have dipression or lost apetite. Some ""activist"" circles are trying to push it for so called ""educational"" purposes.If you are finding these episodes described in the book ""educational"", than consider my opinion being wrong:- rape- sex of a man with a boy- attempt to have sex with a dog- sex of a teenage boys- different disgusting underage homosexual related episodes- etc, etc....FOR PARENTS: Please do not give this book to your young childrenunless you want to traumatise them.Sincerely yours,K"
1,Plain Story of a High Schooler; Topic has been tried before,"A simple dull tale about a boy's high school nightmare, this has been tried before in a numerous amount of books. If it weren't for MTV, this book wouldn't have got to where it is now.Bad choice, future delinquents may find this book cute."
3,Entertaining,"This book was just that. Entertaining. I never particularly felt like going out of my way to read it, but when I had a few minutes to kill, it was something good to kill it with. I felt it was short and the story didn't really get to evolve to its full extent."
1,I don't get it.,This book was recommended to me by a friend. I also learned it was made it a movie. I hope the movie was better than the book. I couldn't get past page 10.
1,The perks of being a wallflower,I thought this book was poorly written and awful. I kept reading thinking at some point it would get decent but it never did. It just plodded along in an odd way. I felt no empathy for the main character and the other characters had no depth either. I understand they made a movie out of this. Why? Rotten Tomatoes alert.
3,Different for my taste but enjoyed it,I found this book to be really different. I usually enjoy reading mysteries and sci fi novels. But this book managed to hold my interest.
3,Charlie autistic?,Did anyone else get the feeling that Charlie was autistic?The book itself was okay. But I couldn't help but wonder if he was on the spectrum for autism.
4,Very interesting,"For the most part, this book was great. It really shows the transition from innocence to adulthood. The main character, Charlie, provides the audience with a way to connect with what he is going through. The book is very philosophical. I just wish that the ending was a little bit more clear."
4,"Great read, but not necessarily ""innocent"" or ""classic""","I loved reading this book. It seems that most coming of age stories have a little something that everyone can relate to--the greatest strength of this work is how it brings its whole story to the level of something the average millenial can relate to.That being said, I don't believe this work is destined to become a classic. It seems to be a little bit too much of a product of it's time, while lacking that essential quality to become timeless. While many interesting things assemble the plot, the ending is a bit hackneyed and predictable.If you're not afraid to share things like casual pot use, smoking, sex & homosexuality in high schools (all of which except the latter should be pretty tame game by now), go ahead and suggest this book to one of your 80s kids."
5,I'm Speechless,"The contents of this book have not only made me want to listen to better music, but have also made me think twice about an assumption made against a person. I never would have guessed that his aunt was doing that to him, and I spent a lot of my time trying to figure out what was up with Charlie. In reality I fell in love with him, and can only hope that there are still pure hearted individuals out there. I was just taken aback at how amazing this story is, and the letter format made the reading very intimate. This book is radical, I loved it!"
3,More comfortable than they look,"I like having a couple extra inches in height and these do the trick. Can double as a sneaker or an oxford-type. I've worn them w/ jeans and slacks. The seam at the laces came apart shortly after i got them, so wasn't happy about that, but I still wear them."
2,"""cheaper"" than expected","overall, the quality was a lot less than expected. The fabric is pretty cheap feeling and looking and flimsy and I don't know how long it will hold up without tearing or ripping. For an inexpensive item to hold trash bags though, I guess it works pretty well. I'm sure that it must have only cost about 20 cents to make though....."
4,great value,Works as advertised and hard to beat for the price. I was able to cram 40 bags into this with just a little bulging at the top but I didn't buy it for the looks so that's fine.
4,Good silent film,Good for silent film buffs. If you're not into silent films look elsewhere first (like buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin).
3,Disgusting.,"Now, I liked (at one point) Ren and Stimpy, but this is vile, degrading humor. Nose pickings, booger flicking and eatings, feces, bodily self-mutilation and even bestiality are a few of the perversions that are on this video. If you like that sort of thing in animation, go right ahead and pick this up. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,All the lousy animation available,"Badly drawn, boring, slow. *not* the various collections of animations you see at film festivals. At least there's a Plympton, which is where the 1 star comes from. Two people I know shut it off. Avoid. I sure wish I had. END"
3,The Frank Sinatra Collection,"I love Beegie Adair's style and am usually happy with the musical arrangements, but this album disappointed me. I expected more energy and pazazz."
3,Seems better for younger kids,"My son is 6, and this held his attention for all of about 10 minutes. The characters and songs are just geared toward a much younger audience, IMO. The drawback there is that you would have to have a younger child who is ready for math for this to really make sense."
2,Caused Blue Screen crashes,"Specs on this RAM were correct for my application, but unfortunately the RAM would not work for very long.I returned them and instead gotPNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR 333 MHz PC2700 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Module MN1024SD1-333and it has worked great so far."
1,A charge without merchandise,I did not receive the 3 volumes of this book while you charged me for it. You did informed me earlier that you canceled the order due to unavailability but you charged my credit card over $200 for it. Please reverse the charge to avoid a dispute in payment.
4,Quality Patches,"Payed ~$3 for these.Pros: * Clean effectively and leave no debris * Can absorb quite a bit of cleaning oil and grime * Work perfectly on knives, too.Cons: A little expensive, but they are high quality - They should include a few more patches."
1,BEWARE-not Badfinger,This is not the Badfinger tape! You will get instead a Coleman Hawkins jazz tape!
4,The most sucessful album of Engenheiros,"Engenheiros do Hawaii were an ignored band on the scenery of brazilian rock until 1990, when they made this brilliant album. Two songs were a true sucess on radios: ""Era um garoto..."" and ""O exercito de um homem so"".""O Papa e Pop"" has won the ShowBizz (a famous music magazine in Brazil) the Best Rock Album of 1990 Award.The track ""A violencia travestida faz seu trottoir"" has a special participation of Patricia Marx."
3,A TV Movie,"This was originally done for the Discovery Channel. Part of the reason it's lacking certain things is the limitations for commercial interuption on the air. I felt it could have plunged a little deeper, but what I really appreciated were Robert Johnson's contemporaries and friends remininsing. Being that there's very little material around on the historic Robert Johnson it's these sorts of interviews that are going to preserve the biographical aspects on a man whose life and image are just as fascinating as his music. Be forewarned, you'll want it to be longer."
4,Easy to use,"Good, solid rack. You will need to carry two wrenches to get it on and off, but removing the rack only takes about 20 seconds. The metal hook on the strap could use a plastic or rubber coating to protect the paint on the car trunk, but I just added some padding of my own and all is well."
4,Essential Herzog,"Many fans of Aguirre seem to have trouble with this film, which has only 27 edits. One need not have a stalwart attention span to endure this film, only an interest in insanity, a recurring theme of Herzog's work. The performances are really brought to the fore in this film, making it's theater origins all the more apparent, particularly with the solilioquies that several of the characters give when they are alone. But just as cinema was borne of theater, there are some quintessentially cinematic scenes that more than make up for any staginess elsewhere. I rank Herzog up there with Kubrick and Scorsese as directors who understand better than anyone else the power of music combined with psychically compatible images. The opening sequence is a prime example. While this is not one of his very best films, it is one of his most difficult and well-acted. B+"
2,Woyzeck--An awkward film,"Woyzeck took 18 days to film and four days to edit, but Herzog claims that this was perfect. The film presents different interesting philosophical and pseudo-scientific notions through the main character Woyzeck (Klaus Kinski) and his 18th century town. Kinski portrays Woyzeck with an outstanding performance, but the whole cinematic experience seems mechanically absurd and awkward. However, after viewing many other Herzog films, he remains one of the leading directors in German cinema."
1,Totally useless!! Don't buy it.,"DO NOT EXPECT TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS DVD. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, there is nothing instructional on this DVD. I only wish I had read his review before I bought it. SHAME ON YOU, OSCAR HERNANDEZ FOR RELEASING SUCH A MISLEADING TITLE. SHAME ON US FOR BEING MISLEAD. The music is superb, but again this title does not deliver as advertized."
4,"Easy setup, great tech support","I'm very pleased with this remote. It was relatively easy to setup online, allowing one many options to configure. I did have a slight problem during the setup, but a call to the tech support was the very best! They were able to fine tune my remote as we spoke and stayed with me until everything was working just the way I wanted.The only issue I have is that the buttons on the remote are very small - especially the number keys that one uses everyday. I was told a newer version is addressing this."
5,Love my first harmony remote,"I picked this up for $50 on Amazon a few days ago...I had been contemplating buying a Harmony for a few months now and could never justify the cost to myself...then came this deal and I bit the bullet.There are only two words that can describe my experience - Love it.It took me a little while to get it programmed, but it was worth the 30 mins I spent configuring 6 devices and 4 activities...I had read that this remote didn't really work well with Olevia tvs and I have 2 of 'em.However, I could get it working very well with my tv's, dvr, divx player and home theater.This has actually replaces all my remotes."
4,Univeral Remote,"Logitech Harmony 550 Universal RemoteOnce programmed it has worked very well. Must have a internet connection and register with their site. Device data base is a little lacking did not have the new Samsung LCD HDTV, did have all of old devices though.Progamming was a little more complicated than I would have expected."
4,It's Ok,"I bought it when it was on sale fully aware of some of the problems that other people have had. Basically I think this remote is great in theory, but it is a little hard to use at times. When I watch a DVD , I have to switch the input, but that reuires me going through the TV to do it. The remote supposedly is suppose to do it automatically. I also can't ontrol the volume when I watch a dvd and I have to switch to the controls of the tv to do that also. Those are the only problems I have had. It controls my Tivo very well which is thae reason I bought the thing. anyways, I say its worth the purchase, but only when it goes on sale for 50 bucks."
4,great remote.. well worth it's price,"I bought this remote for $50 from here... and had it for more than a month.. I absolutely love this remote, especially for the price!I have a tv hooked up to a cable box, tivo, dvd player, xbox 360 via a onkyo 5.1 reciever and I had to use atleast 3 remotes for using any of the stuff before... this remote really saves me all the chores... now I mostly have to use 1 button ;)easy to use, does what I expected it to do.. battery that came with the remote is still going strong, so no complaints really.. but again, I wasn't expecting much :)thanks,pal :)"
1,Not as good as expected,"This remote really wasn't as good as expected. Yes, it can do a lot of things, but the timing is slow (it takes a while to turn on the tv and there is some lag time between the remote and cable box). I've had this remote for about a year and now the screen on the remote is barely readable (this happened after I put new batteries in the remote). I might have a defect, I don't know, but I do know this was a waste of money and I won't ever buy a harmony remote again."
4,Good remote,Very happy with this purchase. Does the job of three remotes. I thought the set up was a little bit much but it was worth it. It seems like this unit has some kind of motion sensor I wasn't aware of. When you enter the room and get near the remote it will light up and let you know where it is. I don't know if it is supposed to do that but it's a nice feature.The remote is easy enough to use that I can almost use it entirely without looking at the buttons. For those times where you need to switch between vcr/home theater/ cable box the screen and keys are will lit so it really is user friendly. There is also a glow button that will light up the entire remote in case someone else less familiar wants to use it.Good remote.
1,Dosen't work the way I hoped,Many weeks have passed by since I received this unit and I still do not have in working properly. I am not happy!
3,Awesome product.....if it worked right...,"The concept of this remote is excellent. Very user friendly. One easy setup. One button activity selection. Very nice.However, the daily use of this remote presents challenges. The buttons are hard to push sometimes. The remote is not always responsive. It also has already frozen on me, after only one month of use! I had to take out the batteries and put them back in to reset it. Still a few kinks to work out, but overall, it is pretty convenient, when it works."
4,Great remote!,Really easy to setup and easy to use. Great looking remote. Very slim and sleek. Only issue I have is sometimes the buttons aren't very receptive.
2,owner's manual,"Installation went smoothly however I do not seem to have all the functionality for the control of a Sharp Aquos TV. In particular, there does not seem to be an equivalent of the button on the Sharp remote that allows picking the ""View Mode"" (stretch, zoom, etc.) and there is no owner's manual to help with this, either in the package or on-line.Also, the unit cannot control my Bose system as its' control is not infra-red, however you would not know that from the info on the Amazon site and you discover it only when doing the installation."
1,"Still not working, no hope that it ever will.","Got this remote for the holidays, still not working. Have tried at least 10 times. Setup SEEMS easy, but then when using it in the real world, my devices go crazy. Every time is something different, things turning on and off wrong, different modes. We even tried eliminating our surround sound box, and only have a TV and cable box now. No good. Emailed customer service twice. No response. Called customer service, was on hold so long (>30 min) I gave up. I am a programmer, and I still can't get this to work. Seems like a complete waste of money. It looks cool though. Maybe it's just a prop from ""Minority Report!"""
5,the best remote!,This is an awesome remote. I wouldn't go with any of the other more expensive ones!
4,perfect for systems with lots of remotes,"I have a HTS which includes 50"" DLP; digital converter box; 3 dvd players and recorders; receiver for 7.1 system; dish network receiver and projector for 145"" screen. This requires a lot of different remotes and this Logitech 550 eliminates most of the remotes and makes it easy to hit one button for the situation needed. I would recommend this remote. For best prices do your research."
3,Frustrating behavior,"The set-up interface is clever and useful, but the result has not been completely satisfactory. The detailed programming required to make it work correctly has been extensive and I'm still not happy with the result. This might still be the best bet for a $100 universal, but if so, the technology is not quite ready to be adopted by the mainstream consumer."
1,sucks,Harmony 550--This item is a nightmare. I can't view a VHS tape after taping it. I bought 2 of these remotes and paid the GeekSquad at Best Buy $500 to program it. My husband I can't do anything we did before. I'm not even 70 yrs. old and have a master's degree.I'm sure this site will never aire my complaint.
1,2 Hrs is way too much,"This is the deal killer for me, the remote is fine, the set up is easy, the the damn thing is on stand by for 2hrs before shutting off completely, why would someone want this to be on for that long? I rather stick with a traditional non fancy remote, that is dumb as a brick, and just program and use.Too bad a lot of remotes do not recognize the Olevia TVs."
3,full of wonder full of woe,"Good value for the money. Easy to program via internet. Buttons require dainty digits (way too small and too crammed for normal fingers). Incorrect macro's keep repeating the same mistakes, poor ability to ""relearn"" and correct these errors. Still, overall good performer for the money"
2,Good and Bad,"I finally bought a universal remote when I finally got tired of juggling 5 different remotes for my entertainment system.I like that you use your computer to setup the remote, and using the phone customer support, the technician can even change setting on the remote for you. However, I find the setup page for the remote very poorly laid out and confusing. And I'm a reasonably tech-savy person with lots of electronic gizmo's. I hate to think what a hard time someone with little tech-savy will have with the remote set-up. They will probably either chuck it out the window or return it.Logitech has a lot of fine-tuning left to do on this product."
3,It Lasted 9-1/2 Years,We paid $99 for opened-box unit and the Geek Squad guy charged us $145 (well worth it)to program it in 2002. Buttons were ok mostly (always an effort to push the tiny things perfectly) until lately when they started getting hard to push. Then it died. I probably never used (or understood or RTFM) 95% of the features but it did run 3 appliances alright.
5,This Product works great!!!,"This product works like a dream. I needed a memory expantion for my pda, i just popped this card in and my memory was instantly 10mb rather than my previous 2mb. I would reccomend this product to anybody who owns a handspring visor and is in need of a memory expantion. It is also priced very fairly. At just 39.99 it is way worth the money."
4,What used to be..,"This album is fun, untidy and loud and that's why I like it. I own all the Goo Goo Dolls albums and they are all great, believe me they are, but this is what the Goo Goo dolls WERE as offered to what they are NOW. Don't buy this album if you are only accustomed to Dizzy Up The Girl because it might blow your mind. 4 stars."
3,NOT as good as the others,"I love the goos, but this album is not up to par with the more recent....it is good, but only if you like punk. Some of the vocals suck, and 22 seconds annoys me. The best song is Just the Way You are. I enjoyed it, but not as much as Superstar Car Wash, A boy Named Goo, or Dizzy Up the Girl. Only get this CD if you are a die hard goo fan...if not, you won't like it."
1,utterly banal,"Imagine every trite thought that went through your head when you were an adolescent, then imagine writing it all down calling it a book. You think that this boring 12-year-old point of view will end fade and a grown-up plot will evolve, but it doesn't, it goes on and on and you stop when you can't take it any more, even if it's not the end of the book. At least that's what I did."
4,So much like all of us,"I can't remember reading a rite of passage book for women that touched me as this one did. The setting, the characters, the angst--these are all part of the tapestry by which women achieve that status of womanhood. I could not stop reading! My only complaint was that this journey was too short. I still hover with her as she seeks her mother's voice to send her safely through her quest."
3,emotionally moving,"Although I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's, I'm not sure whether or not I liked this book, which had a very choppy presentation as it moved from scene to scene. It certainly moved me greatly, but I'm left with a very heavy heart, a blanket of sadness for this motherless child, who is the same age as my own daughters, having to endure the awkwardness of adolscence with an emotionally distant and abusive father. It was very hard to endure the scenes where he hit her and her sister. I hoped Diane would follow through with her idea to report her father's abuse, although I sensed that she never would. I was touched by the interactions between Katie and her friend Cherylanne's mother, and by the kindness of Diane's boyfriend Dickie. I found myself cheering for the children in their attempt to escape this oppresive lifestyle.I'm glad there are two follow-up books (Joy School and True To Form) because I am left very empty not knowing what happened to them all"
3,Nice but the color ...,Color isn't what it appears online. I was expecting a sage green and it is a much darker green. Not cute at all. Quality is good though. I already own these in baby pink which I love and I plan on getting them in other colors.
1,bad for me,"i used it for my synthesizer, when I tried to plug it out, it was stuck in the hole and I could do nothing but cut it... it broke into pieces and some parts were still stuck inside...I won't buy it again"
5,Songs from my childhood,"It was a delight to discover this book that we had in our childhood. It was in very good condition, and we will enjoy using it at a reunion planned for later this summer."
3,help,"There is one song in the movie that is NOT on the cd and that really annoys me. It goes, ""who's your daddy? who's your daddy? is he rich like me?"" and that is NOT on the cd!! Does anyone know who that is that sings that? or even what I'm talking about? Oh, yeah. that Dylan song was fantastic."
3,CD too short,Say what you like about the collection. It has a certain flavour like many do that is representative of the movie it is from combined with familiar and stereotyped notions of what encapsulates the 60s. But 15 songs on a CD is TOO SHORT. There could easily be well over 20 songs. Why are compilation CDs often so short nowadays?
1,Who needs it?,"Yeah, the Bob & Joan thing is great. And there are cool songs here, like ""Draft Morning."" But really, who needs these stupid collections strung together for no other reason than they were all stuck in the same commercial...er, movie. And oh yeah, ""Chicago"" is from the '70s, man."
4,This is a great collection of 60's music!,I was fortunate enough to watch the movie and to listen to this soundtrack. Both are excellent! But I was somewhat disappointed that not all of the music was included in this CD. But what is on here is as good as it gets. I was not a product of the 60's (born in 77). But I still enjoyed this collection. The 60's rule!
5,good cd,The cd was a trip down memory lane and brought back lots of good ones. The product was in good conditionas well.
2,Same ol' trite stuff.,"This CD is the same crud the radio stations play as ""all the hits from the 60's"". There are so many good tunes that are always overlooked. I have a better selection in my collection than anything on this CD."
3,Poetic Justice,"If your a Pac' Fan it's interesting to see the change from Juice and his later work,I am not a Fan of Romantic movies or Janet but I don't think that should keep anyone from watching the movie aside from the usual repetitive poetry(if it can be called poetry,Art is in the eye of the beholder)and aside from the scene where they are at some festival and some dumb band is talking about ""revolution"" and all that other non-sense,the film holds it's on in most aspects but it is still one big Janet Plug(No Music from Pac')"
4,Deserves four stars.,"Dennis W. Alvey is being unreasonable by giving this movie one star. I am also very disgusted by his comment that ""at least tupac is dead."" That was a very cold comment about someone that I, and many other people look up to. Anyway, the movie is about Lucky the mailman (Tupac)and his friend taking a trip from L.A. to Oakland. They take Regina King (Pac's friends girl) and her friend Justice (Janet Jackson). Lucky and Justice had a mutual disliking for eachother after Lucky dropped the mail off, and accused Justice of being unfriendly, saying that she never smiles. During the road trip we witness, the disgust that Lucky and Justice have for eachother, turn into an endearing relationship. This movie does not provide comedy or action, it provides the blossoming of a relationship, along with some great acting by Janet, but especially Tupac (he steals the show). Good flick overall."
3,good,"a liked this film for one thing, it was very harted. and another thing i was in love' so there. but i was not inpress with jannet jackson,s ackting. but 2pac's was good as anyother film.the end."
2,Just an awful movie!,"I am a big fan of Janet Jackson and Tupac's music. However, they are both awful in the boring movie! Tupac is a dog towards women and treats Jackson terribly but she is attracted to him. The two spend the day riding around in his mail truck (he is a mailman in this one) and you can virtually go to sleep and not really miss anything important.If you want to see Tupac, I suggest some of the action films he made. Jackson is definately not the cute little girl from Good Times in this film. Just an awful movie."
5,Completely Awesome!,Serious evolutionist beware! this is the book you have been looking for...Covers so much
2,"poor quality, wholly inadequate","This product has improved the visibility of the screen only by the slightest of margins, in my experience. Earlier comments about the light being bluish, and about a glare dot are also accurate.Amazingly, Nyko does appear to have put SOME thought into this device, evidenced by it's low power consumption, extension of the EXT port, and cool(?) looks.Recommended for racoons and ex-KGB agents."
1,Very Poor Light Source,"The Worm Light Advance seems like it would be a good addition to one's Game Boy Advance accessories, however, it really isn't even worth its low price. The Worm Light deserves one star as while you use it you can still hook in the link cable THROUGH the Worm Light because it has a port. On the other hand, the light is supposed to do just that, GIVE LIGHT, and it hardly can fulfill its only purpose for existence. The light it barely provides hardly brightens up 2/3 of the screen. THEN, the actual bulb that hangs over the screen gets in the way of the screen blocking most of the game during play. There are better GBA lights on the market so stay away from this one and invest in another."
2,It is bright,"It gets a 2 for being bright. I would like to use something like this as a book light. For GBA, no. The only position that lights the screen properly is the same position that causes the most glare. No way around it. going to look for a Afterburner Kit."
2,doesn't work,I do not use this product alot because it doesn't even work for ME!!!!! I used it maybe once or twice but it doesn't work anymore!!!!!1
2,Monotony & Flexibility,"Although the yoga exercises were reasonable enough, the monotonous tone of the instructor's voice was irritating. My 8-year old daughter and I very much preferred Yoga fitness for children."
1,Disappointed,"I love this movie but since it is no longer available in stores, I ordered it here. It was supposed to be in ""very good condition""; however, there are bad places in the dvd and important parts of the movie are lost. I will think twice before ordering a used dvd again."
1,Pointless and boring,"This movie is soooooooo terrible, because the script could have been written by a random-cliche generator, you could see some of the more talented actors questioning why they were in this movie as they delivered their dead lines and the plot is so boring that I would rather slowly cut my own fingers off with a rusty spoon than watch this movie again."
2,"Nice ending, but that can't make up for everything else.","Kevin Costner is a grieving widower who believes his deceased wife is trying to contact him. Supernatural drama from the director of Patch Adams (Gah!) is pretty dull and silly in execution, with some good ideas but mostly poorly executed. The finale is surprisingly pretty good, with a twist ending that actually works, but can't make up for everything else that's so lackluster. Costner's okay here, acting the same way he usually does in all his films."
4,Pleasant love story,"First, I do have to say I like Kevin Costner is just about any movie, but this brought out a very gentle side of Costner.The movie is part spiritual, mystery, thriller, romance and love. It is definitely, ""what would and how far would you go to unearth a mystery and give your love and life for the one you were meant to be with.""I really like the movie-I own the movie (B)"
5,Simply awesome!,"In the end it's a feel good movie... Not tons of action or drama, just a good movie..."
2,Not as good as I expected it will be,"Ever since it hit pay dirt with ""Ghost"" back in the summer of 1990, Hollywood has been fascinated with tales about dead people attemping to contact their grieving loved ones from beyond the grave. The latest varitation on the theme, afilm called 'Dragonfly' turns out to be one of the sappiest entries in the genre. This movie was truly bad with bad actors and a bad storytelling. The reason I give this movie 2 stars is, because the showdown is great."
2,"Nice ending, but that can't make up for anything else.","""Dragonfly,"" for all its attempts at touching our hearts and our hidden fears, is little more than director Tom Shadyac's brain-numbing recipe that essentially tosses elements of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Others,"" ""The Haunting,"" and ""Angel Eyes,"" into a blender and hits puree. It's a cross between a thriller and a human drama, one so confident that its style and shocks will mask its blatantly unoriginal story, that the end, all we feel it cheated out of time and money."
3,great ending,Costner is awesome as the Doctor who finds out his dead wife is trying to contact him. he sees things with his kid patients and then he goes to another country where he finds out a amazing secret his wife left him. sometimes perdictable but the end is not
5,Hard to find tool,"I was looking every where for this sized hole saw, luckly Amazon carries basically everyhting. This hole saw saved me about 260 dollars that I would have had to spend on another tool that made the same size bore. Thanks again Amazon."
2,"Another Doctor, another alien invasion","Same old Doctor Who plot. Don't spend your money on this flashy new hardback. Buy an old Target novel used for a penny and have the same story. Let's face it. The BBC has too much riding on the new series to allow their authors to try anything daring like the Virgin series of the 90's. I will of course be a silly fan and buy the next few, but I won't be expecting much."
2,Kindle edition not worth it,"While the content of the story was intriguing, the numerous spelling errors within the Kindle edition made it painful to even attempt to read. The document was ameteurish at best and childish at worst. I've read fanfiction that had fewer spelling errors.If you can find this in print (at other than it's ridiculous $179 hardcover price), then go that route. The Kindle edition isn't worth the milliseconds it took to download."
2,Not great,"Based on listening to Never Change- which was the first SPM CD I bought, I found this one, bought it and listened to it, I thought it was awful, tried listening to it again Monday and I just can't. I don't know if it's because it doesn't have enough bass, or most of the songs sound the same. Don't get me wrong- I loved NEver change, thought it was one of the best CD's I've ever heard, this one just doesn't cut it for me, I now use the CD's as coasters so I don't stain my tables."
4,Ice Cube is DA BOMB Fo' Life!!! Tight remixes!,"I don't think it's Cube's best yet, but this is HELLA TIGHT!!! I just love ""robbin hood..."" and the remix of ""you know how we do it"" is tight as f#ck, even though the original is better. ther are more thight tracks I can write about but I'll make it short. The MegaMix at the end is straight up DOPE with Cube's ALL past work! Buy it!!!!!!!"
3,More of a coffee table book than text,"I was a bit disappointed by this book and will avoid books in the series in the future. While it is filled with colorful pictures and covers a wide scope, I find it more fitting for casual than academic interest. There is not much in the way a deep discussion, but does serve to provide a starting point. I should have realized that this would be the case before I ordered it, given its few pages and previous reviews. Oh well, it is not a complete loss."
3,not the best guide to geece,"i used to only use Lonely Planet for my travels and loved it. this guide was very dissappointing. the athens info was ok, but with the islands we ended up going to it had very little info on them. even on santorini we saw tons of stuff there that was not in the book, and there were no tips on how to get resonably priced villas, which we did on our own anyways. the places we ended up staying were not in the book. the only thing we ended up using it for was fact-checking.i would recommend 770 greek islands, the other book we had with much more info on everything."
1,A huge dissapointment,"Granted Sharon McCrumb wrote this book in the middle of her extremely well written ballad series, continuing the saga of foresinc anthropologist Elizabeth McPherson. Perhaps she has become bored with the McPherson character. Or prehaps she just wanted a venue to rant about the excesses of liberal academia. In either case, this book is best forgotton. Sorry, Sharron."
1,White Noise.,"These speakers were ideal, and I was really happy with them for the first 3 months... before they became just a couple of really attractive shelters to house static.This seems to be a reoccurring theme with this model from what I've been able to learn so far.Three months of reliable play from a set of brand new speakers is flat out unacceptable. There's no excuse for that."
4,"Good, Clear sound...lacks Bass","I purchased these speakers to replace my original Boston Accoustics 2.1 speakers that had a sub-woofer; but were not very good on midrange clarity. These GigaWorks speakers are Very clear sounding with good mid-range and highs. Even with the bass ports they do lack deep bass tones, which is to be expected I guess. I'm very pleased with them...they bring my World of Warcraft experience alive with very clear sound effects. Very pleased with the quality for the money!!"
4,excellent small computer and TV speakers,"I bought these speakers and they are great. Easy to set up, no big woofer box to worry about. I bought them to use on my computer, but tried them out on my TV setup and they work great there. So much easier to hear the dialog and the music comes through better. I compared these in the store to several other brands and for the price and small footprint these are the ones to get.I am going to buy anohter pair for my computer."
4,One cool kitty-cat,"I always fancied Hello Kitty, and my 2-year-old daughter loves cats. So I knew she'd be a big fan of the colorful, whimsical images in this hardcover book. (She also has a habit of tearing colorful pages out of books, but so far I've been able to keep this one intact!) This is really more of a ""big girl's"" book because of the silly haikus that correspond with the images, but it sure is fun to flip through. Le chat en France? Mais oui!"
3,Good Enough,"Lethem has proven himself to be a virtuoso of story-telling. His books, for the most part, inhabit a plane of existence that defies much classification, and they wield their creativity with the force of a sledgehammer but the precision of a scalpel. Although his work can sometimes be uneven, it is always entertaining, and certainly never average or boring (to be fair, though, his short stories are hit-and-miss).This little nugget is, for the most part, a success, but it also comes across as only partially-formed. And although it is, as usual, beautifully and skillfully told, it seems to be less a fully realized tale and more a creative exercise. Lethem, here, is just stretching is literary limbs. Consider listening to a highly touted operatic singer practicing her scales: it's still beautiful singing, and it may even be fun to listen to, but it isn't a song, and there's just not that much to it."
4,We love SIKU vehicles,"SIKU vehicles have proven to be the best choice in our household. They are more realistic and sturdier than the many many other types we have. My son, who is 6, was frustrated at first by the fact that the loader would fall easily off of this flatbed. It took us some playing around to figure out how to keep it on (most of the time), so I wanted to share this tip:- keep the scoop on the loader in its down position- drive the loader to the front of the lowest portion of the flatbed- close the ramp behind the loader until it CLICKS into positionNow you can drive reasonable fast and take some turns without the loader falling off. I do wish they'd made a way to latch it on there for even more security...then it would get 5 stars!"
1,Poor quality,"Shame on these people for releasing such a bad quality video. While I enjoyed the game, I will find another version of it to enjoy and will discard this one.Beware future videos from them."
1,Brass should shine,I recently purchased a set of the Hoppe's decorative hangers to go along with the rifle case I purchased. Serriously? I thought brass was supposed to shine. I opened the package to get a better look and it looked like it had been in the package for years. The shipper apparently ever served in the armed forces and had to use Brasso. That's what I did for two hours straight to get the shine it should have. Would not recommend this at all
4,A Great Find,"My husband asked me to hang his rifle for him, and I REALLY didn't want to hang it on some big, ugly, wooden gun rack. I was so happy to find these hangars, because they were small, and the brass fits in perfectly into the decor of the room. I was nervous about installing them because the screw holes are only half of a hole and I worried that the hangars could slip under the weight of the rifle, but they haven't budged."
3,Great Item But Terrible Mounting Screws,"The Hoppe's decorative hangers actually quite nice. Heavy cast brass, nicely polished and lined with a leather/suede weapon contact surface. The drawbacks are the very chintzy and poor quality mounting screws and the ""U"" cutouts on the mounting brackets themselves. If you purchase this mounting item do yourself a favor and plan on replacing the included brass colored mounting screws with screws of a more robust nature otherwise your prize possession may end up on the floor with a significant amount of ""new"" damage!"
1,Not even close to being an 8 inch tray.,"These trays are very, very small and only a small pot will fit on them. They should not be advertised as 8 inches as they are not even close. Be sure to read the whole description, which I didn't, and I am paying for it with 6 pots under 7 inches which do not fit my plants. I feel they the title description is deceptive. Also not brown the color is black."
5,An exellent addition to any otaku bookshelf,"I really enjoyed this book. It's in-depth, informative, and it never talks down to you. It's made for the hardcore Sailormoon fan. I think it's terrific that this book was made. It shows that fans can think outside of the tv screen.I've been a Sailormoon fan for many years, yet there were things in this book that I never knew. It's like you're walking down the streets of Japan. Anyone who calls themselves a Sailormoon otaku needs this book!"
5,Very interesting,"I've been a fan of the Japanese version of Sailormoon since I was a little girl, so when I saw this book I wanted to buy it. It goes into detail about specific places used in the series that actually exist (or are based on) in Japan! It also goes in depth on characters and their backgrounds of Japanese mythology, religion, etc. An example: the three talismans that belong to Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are based on the talismans related to the myth pertaining to the birth of the first Japanese emperor. It all ties in together and shows you how much Naoko Takeuchi put into her story."
3,A Little Dry,"In this very short semi-guide book, more than half of the contents are of places and their history. The rest is very interesting dealing with ideas and concepts of the show in relation to Japan, however high price for a very short book."
3,Good video,"This video is worth watching, however I would recommend over a few days. This video is long and very monotone in presentation. Other than that, there is some pretty good information giving out in the video by the author."
5,MY CAT'S FAVORITE TOY!!,"This cute green fish must be loaded with catnip because my cats go nuts for it, they love to lick it, bite it, attack it and kick it with their back feet. I thought the price and shipping were a bit steep, but they're worth it because they lasts for a long time and have alot of catnip to keep your cat interested. Even my 17 year old cat, who shows no interest in playing anymore, went crazy for this fish toy. Catnip toys from stores suck, they barely have any scent to them. But Yeowww products SMELL SO GOOD!! I also bought the Yeowww banana toy - also wonderful! BUY THEM! YOUR CATS WILL LOVE YOU!"
3,different smell,"I used to buy white linen (breeze)in my country (Greece) and in Europe. The last 2 years it is not produced any more consequently I can't find it in Europe or even in Middle East. When I find it in ""Amazon"" I decided to buy it. When it came I realised that her smell was not precisely the same. Perhaps the reason of that difference is make that those that I bought in my country were prepared in Switzerland while the one that I bought from the ""Amazon"" is prepared in USA"
2,"Oh, boy...","I'm sorry to say that I was relly disappointed in this movie. I really like Kiefer Sutherland and this fell short.This emphasizes weak acting and poor direction from Sutherland. Whitaker is OUTSTANDING in this early role for him.The story does get better as you watch it, after you get through the steamy shower scene with the terrible ""sexy electric guitar"" music. *gag*"
3,Last Light Movie,"This was a decent movie, though not Kiefer Sutherland's best. My girlfriend and I decided to see it after getting hooked on 24. If you want more Kiefer Sutherland, this is still a good movie to see."
5,Interesting alternative view of Jesus,"While the book can occasionally get a bit academic (and therefore difficult for the layman), one has to recognize that this is a fine piece of research. Unfortunately, as he only uses scripture and other gospels in his description, you will not leave with a complete picture of the man, but you will at a minimum better understand what he was trying to accomplish and his view of the world on far more human terms. Indeed, the miraculous Jesus disappears here and we are simply left with a truly unique young man with a phenomenal philosophy (especially considering the time frame), which in some ways is even more remarkable than the miracles themselves."
4,a fair interpretation,"for the most part, I've always liked Crossans work and this is no exception. As I have started writing reviews, Ive noticed several differant categories of readers: minimalists, historians, fundementalist, athiest, anti-catholics, anti-semitists, spiritualists and so on. If Crossan is any of these, he is a historian. He is only argueing what he can textualy prove. This book is not argueing faith, but historical text and is by far useful in that context. Can anyone show us the real Jesus? Probably not. But Crossan gives us a fair reconstruction of part of his life and personality. I do not always agree with Crossan, but as a historian I recomend this book."
1,Maybe I'm just stupid...,"...or maybe I've been ""dumbed down"" by MTV and glossy periodicals, but I could not make heads or tails of this book! Was this thing hard to read or what?To gain a more complete appreciation of Christ, you have to look at the various historical texts about him. And yes, you must examine the context in which these texts where written. Based on the reviews here, I expected this book to do just that. Instead what I got was an in-depth (and I mean in-depth) look at the socio-economic conditions and policital blah-blah-blahs of who knows what. I'm halfway through the damn thing and Jesus is nowhere to be found. Come on, man! Drop the double-talk and get to the bloody point!"
2,Horrible Packaging,"I was so excited to get this in the mail. I want to work in forensics and I figured this would be a good studying tool (along with books)for learning the bones. Its funny because when I went to check what I got, the girl pulled out this oversized, long, rectangular box and I was like, ""What is that?!"" Im 5'6 and this box almost came up to my breasts! The packaging was ridiculous and unnecessary. I dont understand why it didnt come in a tube like all posters do. This was folded in three, which resulted in deep creases on the poster. And since it wasnt secured, every bump the box has, shows on the poster. The poster is very detailed and would make a great studying tool, but they need to ship things off right. I'm sending it back the way it should have come, in a tube."
4,pretty good,works great!! A bit louder than what i was expecting. I have recomended it to a few of my clients as well.
5,Works well,"So far this item is working just fine. It's a no-brainer to put together. It does run very quietly and seems to be helping my child, who has asthma. The air that comes out is cool, so in winter, we have it away from her bed... but it will be great in the summer."
2,Not effective against airborne allergens,"Disappointed. High setting is too disruptive (noise-wise) to be a practical option. On medium, this purifier is ok but not really very effective at keeping dust/allergens out of the air. Another side effect, more so in the winter, is that the air flow makes the room cold, yet the particles tend to move around instead of through the purifier. Another downside is the size of this thing. Its an eyesore considering you are supposed to place it at least 3 ft from any wall/furniture.I do not recommend this purifier."
5,Air purifier,"After much research I decided to purchase this Honeywell Air Purifier. I wanted one which didn't emit ozone, as well as control the cat dander and pet smells. What a job this purifier has done! We have been very pleased!! A few family members have allergies to cats. They stayed with us for 5 days with no allery issues! This has been well worth the money spent,,,,,in fact it was so inexpensive we are talking about buying a second one for another room in the house."
3,"Not Silent, Quite Large","I've had this Air Purifier for about a month, and seems well-built and appears to do a good job. But, a potential buyer should be aware of a couple of things.It is not silent, especially on the 2 higher settings, and they recommend the highest. I don't know how they get away with calling this ""SilentComfort"". It sounds like a fan. Putting it on the low setting and a soft surface helps.It is quite large, and, if you follow directions, it's supposed to be about a foot or so away from any wall or object. That doesn't leave many good options, unless you have a very large area."
5,"Quiet, almost too quiet","I never appreciated this product as much as I did until I just went to change the pre-filter. After 6 months of almost constant use it had a thick buildup of dust all around it.After purchasing this product I did notice the air in my apartment just seemed fresher, it did not seem as stuffy and cooking odors did not linger as long.When I first purchased this Honeywell I turned it on the low setting and could barely hear it, which worried me because part of the reason I bought it was for white noise at night. On the high setting it is loud enough to provide enough white noise.In the six months of owning it has been very dependable and easy to use. I highly recommend it."
1,My Experience,"I returned this item. There is no barrier between the part of the machine which pulls in air and the part which pushes it out again. I believe it picks up dust, and then just blows it out again without ever going through the filter. If you put a ribbon above it there is no air movement at all. So I don't believe that it is changing the air in the room. Also, it blew carbon, from the filter into the air, which got in my eye. I do not recommend this product."
5,good air filter,"i am very happy with this product. we had lots of dust and dander in the air , after running this unit for a couple days the amount of dust you can see has dropped waaaaay down.the pre filter collects alot and needs to be cleaned about once a week . i think i'm breathing easier at night too."
1,Failed after about 4 months,"This seemed to work well in the beginning. It ran quietly and, judging by the amount of dust collected on the prefilter, was doing its job. After about 3 months, though, it began to squeak or chirp. Initially, I figured it was the same vibration issue suffered by many air purifiers, but a month later, the unit stopped working altogether. The motor would hum but the fan did not move. While it's covered under warranty, return shipping cost me about $40."
4,Works Well,"I do like the purifier and would recommend it to everyone that feels they need one. It works fine, but is not as quiet as I would like. I run it mostly on low to keep the noise level down."
4,HEPA filter,"We bought this product last month and have been using it mainly in the master bedroom which also has a master bath attached. Although we have not used it 24/7 as suggested in the user's manual, the air in our room smells a lot cleaner and we have been getting fewer sinus headaches and are breathing easier in the mornings. The mechanism is relatively quiet compared to an older model that we had. For smaller rooms in the house, I may consider getting a smaller sized model as this one does take up space."
2,Loud on High,"It seems to work well, but is too loud when set on high. I think the name of the unit is misleading. It also takes up a lot of room."
5,The Nat King Cole Collection,"Absolutely LOVE this cd, but I wish she had a cd with Christmas songs! Does anybody know of one? I hope someone will convince her to produce a Holiday album!"
1,Both Bottles Were Spoiled,I have been purchasing this item for some time now and this is the first time I have ever received this product spoiled both bottles were unusable.
5,The Heavenly Man is a Wonderful Book!,"I purchased this book for an elderly aunt of mine who was a missionary to Africa with my uncle. I speed read through portions of this book and will have to buy myself one. The book is well written; it tells about life in China as a Christian minister who has a house ministry. He is persecuted; he remains one of the body of Christ and lives through this persecution. This is a wonderful book, especially for those Christians who take their Christianity for granted. Highly recommended."
3,miracles are too much,"i dont trust thisPlease search up on amazon in a new tab ""if i perish esther ahn Kim""That is another popular christian testimony by a korean lady during war times. and her story has much more to do with love and sacrifice rather than miracle healings.The heavenly man, claims to jump over a super high wall. He claimed to have healed thousands and cast out demons and all that.If ur into superstition and u wanna read about these miracles, get this book.but also do some research as there are a lot of people (even sam a house leader in china) who claim that this book is not the real deal.this is too much, and would probably make u raise an eyebrow. but... its well written for the most part."
2,"get the print, not the audio","This book contains excellent tales. It revolves around the life of Brother Yun, from childhood to adulthood, and his missionary efforts in his homeland of China. The tales that readers find in the book are simply unbelievable. Unbelievable, that is, if you don't have an open mind to the power of G-d and His active involvement in our lives today. If you don't, you won't enjoy the book, nor this audio narration of it, so feel free to move on. But if you do, then I solidly recommend the print edition over the audio edition.Read more, and disclosures too, at scriptedgenius(dot)com."
5,Life changing book,"WOW this book is amazing, it has changed my walk forever and I'm only on chapter 3. i HIGHLY recommend this book to other Christians. I can promise u it will change your walk with Christ."
4,Teriffic!,"What an amazing story of Brother Yun and his family and their faith in God! I know it's been going on for centuries, but why do people have to hurt others when they are being peaceful?"
5,AMAZING!,THIS BOOK COULD LITERALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT GIVES THE TRUE LIFE ACCOUNT OF A CHINESE CHRISTIAN WHO STRUGGLES WITH THE PERSECUTION OF UNDERGROUND CHURCHES IN COMMUNIST CHINA. IT REVEALS THE POTENTIAL OF OUR POWER THROUGH JESUS CHRIST WHEN WE ARE WILLING TO SUFFER FOR OUR CONVICTIONS. MUST READ!
1,Just be sure,"make certain this is the ""nickel creek"" you are looking for--this is not the nickel creek who debuted in spring 2000. this is the ""nickel creek band""...by appearance young kids playing cowboy songs which may float your boat, but not necessarily."
3,Review Of Little Cowpoke,"I really like Nickel Creek, but I was disappointed by this CD. I guess I am used to their newer music, so it was a shock to hear ""Little Cowpoke"". They put this CD together awhile ago, so most of the band was really young. This would be a great CD to get for a child because it sounds so young. If you are thinking to buy a Nickel Creek album, pick their newer one."
2,Win XP compatible ?,"No matter Ahead says the Nero 5.5 is full compatible with Windows XP, it isn't !I own a Presario 5122LA running WinXP PRO, as soon as I've installed Nero 5.5 and the later patches, my PC started to show some troubles to refresh the change of CD's, I mean always shows the cd label which was started the PC. Both drives DVD-Rom and CD-RW are in the list of Nero compatible!, what is worse I try to burn a new cd and shows cd has not enough space, or is not a CD-R or CD-RW.So I shout down my pc and restart with the cd I want to burn inside, only this way the cd was burn.As Ahead never give a word, I uninstalled it and re-installed it, now this are much worse any Cd is good no matter is new or not, no matter I start my pc with the cd inside!I've sent a mail to Ahead and find an answer to this bug, but I'm still waiting!!Support is BAD so BAD!Perhaps in others versions is good but why to say, it is WINDOWS XP compatible? if it isn't!!"
3,upgrade,I have been trying to upgrade from version 4.0 to 5.0 and 5.0 won't allow me too. when I emailed tech support they email me back a download page to buy the software again. I feel I am entitled to an upgrade version as 4.0 was weak and I was looking for the new version to come out.
1,No Tech Support,Absolutely no response from Tech Support.Error code that pops up during installation is not mentioned anyplace in the manual or online help tool.It may be a great product but given my experience with it thus far I doubt it.
3,Nero Burning Rom 5.5,"Nero is the best burning software I have tried. I have had issues with Roxio Easy CD creater, especially with CDR-W's so I thought I would give Nero a try and was not disapointed. Unfortunately, after downloading the demo, and after I purchased a serial number for 50USD, I noticed it did not come with any help files ( .HLP). I found it quite tedious trying to find help on their website and the link to the english help files was not working!!The only reason I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars is the poor documentation."
2,Recent versions have plagued me,"I have been a user of Nero since the early version-4 releases. It has always been a great burner and over the years has matured into what can only be described as the best burning package on the market.Since version 5.5.6.4, I have been having a lot of problems with Nero. Were it not for my drive's Burn-Proof technology (Plextor 24/10/40A)I would be burning coasters. Repeated emails to their tech support go unanswered.I suggest people run with the demo for its entire period before buying or wait until they resolve these issues."
1,Do not use this product for backups!,"backup process for 4gigs of data was stopped after the 12th cd used. The program does not tell you how many cd's are required for a backup process. After the 12th cd I became very frustrated not knowing how close I was to the end. Even so, 12 cd's is rediculous and a waste of money. if your looking for a back up software, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!"
4,Putumayo Presents: Republica Dominicana,"As I am mexicana, I love Salsa, Merengue, cumbia, tango, ranchera, and many of the variations in these basic styles of latin music.This Album has a very crisp style to it, I can't really describe this music as purely dominican as I would agree with another reviewer in that I consider 440 Juan Luis Guerra to be a classic example of great dominican music, but it is definitely a worthy buy. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Latin flavored music and latin style."
4,"Mostly a great set, could have been better.","The Max Fleischer Color Classics were Fleischer's attempt to make similar cartoons to what Disney was doing with Silly Symphonies. In retrospect it seems like a mistake, since they were not as unaccustomed to doing soft fluffy harmless characters like Disney did. It's interesting to see how they handled similar subject matter differently.These are classic cartoons, but I was a little disappointed because of the technical glitches. One major problem was that on one of the best cartoons on the set, ""An Elephant Never Forgets"", the audio is a little out of sync which is highly annoying. And you do have to hit the menu button a lot.The video quality is OK but it is all taken from public domain sources so if you have these cartoons on other public domain releases there won't be much improvement there. The audio commentary and art extras are nice. I would have liked to have seen more stressing the differences between Disney and Fleischer."
1,"Oh well, live and learn.","The product arrived on time and billing was on spot. Unfortunately the unit stopped displaying the video. Audio worked but video quit. Tried to get a replacement but the Outlet did not have any other units - no longer in stock. Upgraded unit (at least the cost was more) but got a smaller screen (7"" vs 9""). Waiting for delivery of new 7"" portable DVD player and credit for returned, defunct 9"" portable DVD player. Expect things to go ok from here."
2,"Uneven, with very good moments","This book is so frustrating -- there are moments that are really very good. It's a classic journey of self-discovery (individual and group) and Constantine is a good writer at the sentence level. But, as has been mentioned here, the plot and character development is very uneven. All in all, it feels like it needed another few hours of baking."
5,Honey from the Gods,"Buy this,if not for yourself than as a gift for someone truly deserving! It is absolutely delicious. Will not disappoint. It is unctuous. Does not compare to the liquidy stuff you buy @ supermarket or even at a farmer's market.This is gourmet honey for the discerning palate but my hubby likes it too :)"
2,A Fair Travelogue,"It's a basic, old-style, fairly jolly ""let's go to Britain"" video. Not exactly ""globetrekker"", but it does the job."
2,Another Dewalt disappointment.,"I have been a longtime Dewalt fan. They performed flawlessly and were reasonably priced. This is one of three Dewalt purchases I made in the last year.Along with my review of Dewalt bits, I have to say Dewalt products are miserable. The hole saw cut two holes in the frame of a project car I was working on and quit despite using oil to control heat. A similar non-Dewalt saw I purchased as a replacement (Made in USA) finished the task that the Dewalt could not handle.Disappointing products. Not sure when Dewalt moved their manufacturing but the price savings is definitely not worth the drop in quality."
5,An exceptionally concise and coherent handbook,"An exceptionally concise and coherent handbook which would appear to leave no room for misinterpretation or misdirection in the course of clinician reaching the diagnosis of a mood disorder. In particular, the full bipolar spectrum is propounded magnificently and with great clarity. This is a manual which is written for a professional audience, and therefore I believe the educated lay-reader will benefit significantly from reading this material over any similarly oriented mainstream press. I have, personally, found this book extremely helpful, and I would recommend it wholeheartedly as the most practical and readable book I have ever encountered on the subject of mood disorders."
5,Great Book,This book can be very useful for those interested in learning more about sex and sexual topics or it is a great tool to have if you need to look up something that was mentioned on TV or wherever so that you can understand what was being said.
2,Tired of the series?,"It seems that Mr. Weber has tired of the series he has been writing, and wants to do something else with this character. About 2/3rds of the way through this book, he kills off many of the major characters, while completely breaking with the fairly close historical parallels he has used until now. This carnage is only very loosely motivated, and the authorial hand is far too evident.The characterization (never Weber's strong point) is flatter than ever, and the writing rather more wooden than before.I didn't buy this after I borrowed it, and while I may buy future books in this series (if any) I will probably not pay h/c prices."
1,Ugh-Ugh!!!! Big War Chief!,"I sympathize fully with the ""Ugh!!!!"" review. Over eighty percent of the book was wasted on incidental, humbuggery political machinations, and dripping with preadolescent kitty-'cat nonsense (I suppose to attract the preadolescent female readership here). The only good political machination that I enjoyed was at the end, when the enemy declared a truce to delay their buildup of a final offensive. But the swift ending felt cramped and I felt completely cheated. That ending could have happened within the first half of the book. Then it could have gone on to a mature conclusion worthy of the title and cover art enclosing this novel. But for now the book cover yields to an empty sense of puffery, a smidgen of self-importance, one that is not backed up in the skill of the writing of an interesting tale; in essence, it is an annoying little example of the publication house's latest feat of ledgerdemain -- one rife with tedious adolescent jiggery-pokery."
4,"Good book, but where to go from there...","I liked Ashes of Victory. But from what I see from looking at all of theses other reviews, it is either they loved it, or hated it. Now I didn't read all 77 other reviews, nor will I ever, but from the ones I did read about how they hated it they only said that it was because Honor wasn't in it every much, or that there wasn't much action, or too much of one thing. Well people, you can hate it, but understand that this is more of a transition (memo, I am not a good speller) book. I see it as a major changing, which I am sure others do. It is never easy to change how a seris goes, so it will be different. I however take it as it is, and I hope that... no, I know David will do great in the next one. As one person put, they can't wait to see who the next emeny is, as do I."
2,Tired of Honor's life,"I guess, from reading other reviews, that some things are a matter of taste but I have gotten so bored with Honor and her social life. Other than moving from one society to another there is very little space involved and I find the dialogue repeatative and unoriginal. The characters are two-dimensional and I don't like any of them very much. I just don't see the attraction of this series."
5,"How wonderful, and how sad....","I found this latest installment of the HONOR HARRINGTON series to be both the best and the worst of the books that Mr. Weber has written about her so far. this book has something for everyone - thundering space opera, tricky political dealings, and space battles."
4,Honor is no longer the Subject,"A good read which looks at Honor Harrington's times and recounts them with her as one of many major personalities rather than a book about just Honor's exploits. A nice change that explains matters and moves them along, setting up, I hope, another book focused on Honor herself. As many have observed, Honor has risen so high that she seems out of the adventure/command business, but.... remember back in an early book we learned that Manticore was thought to possibly have another wormhole...and it has not been found. I wonder what will come out of it and if it will be human."
1,hugely disappointing,"Whether this particular bottle has sat around for too long, or it's actually a knock-off and NOT Yves St-Laurent's ""Rive Gauche"" I don't know, but it has essentially no fragrance. A minute after spraying it -- nothing. I have used and loved this particular fragrance off and on for 30 years, and it has become increasingly difficult to find in stores, so I was happy to find it reasonably priced on-line. Ordering from this company was a big mistake."
1,Fake,"I ordered this parfume spray as a gift and it wasn,t the original. I purchased the original so many times from the department stores. Even the box was fake. Iam very dissappointed. Thanks..."
5,"Daryle Singletary "" straight from the heart ""","Well what can you say about the lastest offering from Daryle Singletary apart from the fact it is a brilliant CD, he has a singing voice that comes across as a cross between George Jones and Merle Haggard in fact listening to the CD if you didnt know it was Daryle singing you would think it was George Jones, he may not be one of the biggest stars on the country scene like Toby Keith or Alan Jackson but he certainly would give the big boys a run for there money."
5,Daryle Singletary still great,If you are a fan of traditional country music ---you will love this. Daryle stays true to his style that he has always had. These are some old classic songs re-done by Daryle....some sound even better than the original !!
5,Short and very useful extension cords,I have matching lamps on each end of my mantle and the cords would not quite reach to plug ins. This was exactly the length and type I needed. I was surprised to find this length since all the others I had were at least 6 ft. long. Great buy and just what I needed. They are not at all flimsy either.
4,Works as it should,Bought this to charge my Jump Start Battery pack. Nice to be able to order specific lengths from Cables to Go
4,Exactly right.,"How much can be said about a short extension cord? This was happily exactly what I was looking for, a cord to attach to a hot water pot that needed just a bit of extra length that did not need to be shortened by tying it up and that was not available in any of the local hardware stores. It has weight to it so that I was comfortable with using it with an appliance that heats. I would only want the gauge number to be included in in the description."
5,They get the job done,"I was a little hesitant after reading the review that these can only handle 10 amps, but most (or all) of what I intend to use them for are less. Turns our they are rated for 13 amps, not 10. Not sure if other packages differ.In all a pretty good idea, not crazy about adding the extra cable but is certainly allows me to get more mileage out of a very expensive surge protector since I can now use all the outlets without wasting any to space constraints."
2,Way too expensive!,"These extensions, or liberators if you will, are great but 7 bucks for a 1 footer? C'mon now, I can get these for like a buck or two each at my local computer/electronics store."
5,great experience,Received item quickly and also responded to my questions about the product very quickly which allowed me to purchase the product faster.
4,Inadequate vocabulary,"Too much time has passed since I worked my way through these CDs. No longer studying Thai now, only Chinese"
3,It's educational but doesn't hold my kids attention very well.,"It's educational but doesn't hold my kids attention very well. They watched it a couple of times but they rather see other educational videos we have (Leapfrog, Little Einstein) . I think its approach is a bit below their level (My kids are 6 and 8 years old)."
5,Great for the kids,My 9 and 11 year old boys loved this movie. They insisted that I give it a five star rating..
2,no more claymation for spongbob,This movie was kinda dumb. This movie did not meet the promoted hype. The kids didn't like it at all.
1,Get them free from Bose,"What a rip off. I went to the local Bose store and they gave these to me for free. $4.99 a piece, WOW!"
5,Until the end of play,"This cd is rather hard to find but well worth it if you're a Foreigner fan and you come across it. This is one of those albums you can just put in your cd player and just leave it. There really isn't a bad song. My personal favorites are ""Until the End of Time"", ""Hand on My Heart"", ""Rain"", and ""Running the Risk."" It's a shame this album didn't get much recognition when it was first released in '95. It was probably a combination of lack of promotion by the record company and maybe also the fact Lou was diagnosed with a brain tumor not long after. If you like the long drawn-out songs synonymous with '70's rock, you might like ""Real World"" which clocks in at over 6 minutes. It's worth the money."
1,Too poor and boastful.,"They do not deserve the high mark, they pretend they have. Their strategy consists only from assuring that they are cute and nothing really helpful. Too little actual material to study and it is much easier than in the real test. Especially in math. It is really a waste of money."
1,A Dreadful Book,"Meanders all over the place, with very little insight into the subject of the biography. GS was a complex and fascinating man, who should have been better served by someone who claimed to know him well."
2,Advice is out of date,"This was an outstanding book when it was first published years ago. But it has never been updated, & its advice is horribly anachronistic today."
1,Chicago blues.. photographs of raeburn fleriage,Well it's been 5 week's still no book . I'm sure glad the birthday i ordered this for will be coming around again next year .
5,Turning Algeria Inside Out,Hugh Roberts is the leading anglophone expert on Algeria and this book will cause you to question all of your pre-conceived and half-baked notions of what has been going on in Algeria during the last decade and a half. Roberts is a passionately committed scholar who questions everything and comes up with original and serious critiques of what passes for scholarship and with fascinating reflections that will reward your curiousity and cause you to think deeply about why we understood so little about Algeria.
4,soledad never disappoints,"Open a bottle of wine, and enjoy. If you are expecting Vampyros revisited you wont find it here, in fact the scenes of Soledad in ecstasy are far too brief. But the strange vibes flow and if you like the bizzarre, you will enjoy this movie."
2,A little too slow for me...,"I'm using this text book to teach 8th Graders, and I find it a little too easy for my class. We are able to complete an entire week's worth of homework and the lesson in Monday's class, and there's really nothing to do the rest of the week! Additionally, during the first year, the students only learn the present active indicative tense for verbs and only 2 noun cases (nominative and genitive). There is no actual textbook for the students, so the teacher has to make handouts each week for vocabulary and translations. The only resource for the student is the workbook, which is mostly copying and repetitive work. Repetition is good, but this is a bit much. If you're doing a self-study, it's probably good, and you'll go through the book much faster than 1 lesson per week. If you're using this as a textbook, it's probably more geared towards 6th grade than 8th grade."
1,Not bird safe,"My amazon parrot was very interested in the toy but the first thing he did was bite off one of the balls and very easily could have swallowed it if I didn't distract him with food. The plastic/rubber is too soft for strong birdy beaks even if the texture, shape & colors are very appealing to birds."
1,awful shampoo,"My hair got so heavy and dull with this shampoo that I looked like a different person. I felt like I had a helmet on all the time and probably looked like I did, too! What a waste of money! I switched to Biolage which got bounce back into my hair."
4,Gives a deeper understanding of Bonhoeffer's internal struggles,"Although the author's style is hard to follow sometimes (for me), as in introducing subjects without making clear connections to the rest of the story, the book is still an excellent read. It reveals Bonhoeffer's internal struggles with himself and with ""religion."" It is full of dates, quotes, references to other books and authors. A great resource for someone who wants to understand Bonhoeffer on a deeper level. My only criticism is that it makes we wish the author were seated with me, to explain parts of it!"
2,The Letters to be Found are TOO SMALL!,"I checked this book out of the library and am so glad I did that instead of just buying it! The premise is great -- there is a page devoted to each letter of the alphabet and children are supposed to find the letters ""hidden"" within the words on the page. Well, they really are basically hidden as the font is so small. As my mom said, by the time the child is old enough to actually find the letters, he knows them already. A good concept but the execution could be better. Maybe they will release a large print version."
5,Great music!,Excellent music from a very talented performer. The only problem was burning the files to a disk. Including instructions would be great.
5,A classic book from the early days of Yosemite,"A very humorous book from the early days of Yosemite climbing. The famous Batso Harding pokes fun at the legendary elitists (essentially Royal Robbins) of the period, and offers his own fun filled guide to the sport of rock-climbing. This book is filled with great cartoon style sketches, and actually offers some valuable insight into the sport. An all-time classic book from the early days of big-wall climbing. Warren was on the first team of climbers to climb El Capitan, and numerous other hard routes in the Sierras. He was notorious for a life style that included lots of wine, woman, and fast cars. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This dvd is the worst I ever had, the vocal from singers is really weak, you can hardly hear what they sing unless you turn the volume really loud. I think the recording must have been screwed up. In addition, the packaging is also poor, there is no indication on what digital format the disk has, and it looks so cheap. I am glad that I managed to return the disk to the shop."
1,Poor vocals,"Save your money, the dts 5.1 is terrible. The picture and instruments are pretty good but the vocals sound very distance and in fact you can see their lips move and you hear nothing. I can't believe the group would release this DVD, maybe thats why the price is so favorable."
1,Why Would Anybody Want to Buy This?,"I was forced to watch this by my BSB-doting little sister, and my poor brain hasn't been the same since. Never before in my life have I experienced such television as this. The Boys' psychotic 'dance' moves and their baby girl genuine good looks made me want to give them a good slapping. Beware of this video if you have a weak stomach."
4,I love Sweet Valley,"I have to say that The Senior Year is surely not as good as the regular High School series, but I mean, its still really good. I would say that this book is more for...12 and older...i mean, i guess it's kind of what your parents say. I know there's a little talk about date rape, homosexuality, uh...a little sex...it's not bad and there are a few cuss words here and there, but it's a really good book. This book is about How Elizabeth is totally mad that this boy, Connor McDermett or whatever labels her as a ""dumb blonde"", but she feels so drawn to him."
5,Great New Series!,"I read a few of the old Sweet Valley books and I never really got into them, so I have no idea what possessed me to buy this book. I am so glad I did! I thought that it was so much better than the original series and I will definitely keep with it!"
5,Fantastic!,"I've never been big into SV books, but my mom got me this one becaue she thought it looked good. I read the first 20 pages and couldn't stop--I stayed up until 6 am to finish it. I definitely won't be able to stay away from the rest of the series!!!"
3,Nova Art Explosion 800k Clip Art,"I was quite disappointed to find that the graphics did not always correspond to those shown in the manual. Some were missing or different. Also some of the fonts are not valid font files.Otherwise, the graphics are very good."
3,Not as impressive as it seems.,"Was excited about hoe many cliparts there where. We i received the item and downloaded it, I was not impressed. There were clipart that were in my opinion useless and and not up with the times. If I where to purchase this item again I wouldn't."
1,Look Elsewhere,Outdated Horrendous software. No search function. Terrible interface. Images so so. You have 50 hours in a day? Then go for it.
4,Excellent Product,I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side. This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art. It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images... I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images... I did and I LOVE this product!!!!!
4,"Product good, rebate not","Product is excellent - unfortunately I have been waiting now for 7 months for my ""rebate"" and they have used every excuse in the book for not sending it - (I called them now about 5 times) - so if you need/want the clipart, it's good, but forget getting your rebate!"
2,Doesn't work as described,"All these OXO items are well-constructed as dish-cleaners, but the soap -dispensing function - for which I purchased it- is a dismal flop. The soap does not dispense properly. Despite the printed claim ""No-leak, no-mess soap dispensing,"" the handle leaks non-stop so one cannot leave soap in it. I won't return it this time, but won't repurchase either. It does have a nice solid grip which I really like, but deserves the low rating because it is advertised as a soap dispenser. That is what I needed when I bought it, and that is what I expected."
2,leaked badly,"My mom used to have a generic brand of this type of scrubber that worked fine. So when I bought the OXO, I felt like I would get a good product since I like the OXO brand. But the scrubber leakes horribly and I didn't keep my receipt from Bed, Bath and Beyond to return it. So, I think I'll try the little palm scrubbing brush from OXO. If it leaks, I'll send it back. Don't know if I just got a bad one or what, but usually I can trust OXO brand."
4,Seems to work fine,"The OXO scrub brush seems to be holding its own after more than a year, and after reading the reviews about the plug/seal leaking I have to think that those customers are not pushing the plug in all the way or pumping too hard on the plug to get soap. Ours does not leak and so far we have only replaced the scrub pad once. Granted, the scrub brush is really better for light dish washing because we need to keep a heavy duty brush with bristles nearby for those baked on/hard to clean pots and pans--which helps extend the life of the scrub brush."
2,"Good for some things, but big and bulky.","I like this better than the little round brush that has the soap dispenser in it because this is a sponge-scrubber. If someone would create a little round sponge with soap in it, it would be perfect for me. The angle on this is not perfect for most items and it's bulkiness is an inconvenience in an already inconvenient chore. I bought a pretty deep bowl to rest it in, but it takes up a lot of counter space and I found that after it stayed in there a while, I would choose the sponge over this product, especially when washing up a single item."
1,Don't buy it,"Everything on this is well built, except the sponge. The sponge tears off the mounts after a couple of uses. Complete waste of money."
2,Hard to hold,The handle on this is very unbalanced and difficult to hold. I think it would only be good for men with very large hands. I am a woman and I do have larger hands.The flip top spout used for putting the soap in will snag and open when you try to clean your drinking glasses.The sponge is way to big if you ever had a Libby version then its 2 times the size of those it may sound nice to have a larger sponge but it again makes it harder to manuver and very awkward.This also does not wash dishes very well as a sponge because its covered with a scrubby material. If you need to simply scrub your dishes its better to just get a good dish brush by OXO and they have better ratings.I am back to using my regular dish sponge for now.
4,One of the better models I've used,"The previous owners left one for us when we bought our house over three years ago. I'm here to buy a replacement -- yes, after three years of continuous use. I was surprised to find so many negative reviews. I've never had a problem with ours leaking around the refill area until the rubber started to crack where I constantly push the button, and that was only the last couple of months I think. I like the shape of this head over the rectangular one I used previously, and while the scrubbing surface is nice, it took a while to get used to the fact that a drop of soap needed to come out because it wasn't going to just soak into the whole sponge. The replacement heads are difficult to find in stores, but that's why I have Amazon. I'm also happy to learn it's dishwasher safe because there is a crevice on the back of the head that collects dirt that you just can't get clean."
3,no mide continuidad para capacitores,"no me gusto porque al medir la continuidad de un capacitor de aire acondicionado ,no me lo da,encambio otros del mismo valor si lo dan"
2,Very Disappointed,"This was one of the worst buys I've ever made. I returned my original one, because it made an excessive amount of noise. The replacement made the same amount of noise. The CD-loading mechanism is pretty bad and has to be helped along to work. Now, the tape mechanism is broken.The remote is awful. It looks good initially, but many of the best features are hidden under the plastic shield. It's awkward to use. I don't plan on buying another AIWA product. The JVC I had before was much better."
5,As Told by Ginger- Great for All Ages,"As Told by Ginger was a show I watched as a child, and I was glad to that some DVD's were available to buy. This is a great movie filled with the quirky and loveable characters we all know and love. If you loved the show, you will love this movie.Came quickly and without damage in the mail."
3,It's okay.,"When I was younger, I used to always watch this show. Watching this show at 18 is a lot different. I still think that it was a good movie it just doesn't seem the same as it did when I was younger."
1,Smell like caca,This series(ginger)is like a novela and the creator cancelled the series of rocket power(is much better than ginger) for continue the stupid series of ginger.
3,Interesting book,"This book is well-written. It is easy to read and keeps your interest in general, although it is sometimes a little repetitious and slow. I guess the author repeats the point to make sure you get it.Some of the author's ideas are new and thought-provoking, but you have to wade through some material which sounds like every other book on this topic, as well. In any case, if you are patient you will take away some neat new ideas that you will find yourself using and referring to.I like the examples and anecdotes he uses to illustrate his points - they are really interesting and I have found myself using the examples and referring to them in everyday conversations with people, which is great. I only wish that there were some more examples because it is not always easy to see the point when no example is offered."
4,A great next-step book for uke players,"There are a lot of basic uke books out there (including some by Jim Beloff), but if you already play a little guitar and want to go beyond 3-chord folk songs, there aren't that many books to help you. This one does. A useful, second-stage instruction book that ends with an introduction to chord solos. I've had great fun with it."
4,Carry bag,"Nice bag, little tough to manuver stove into it though. Would have liked handles on the ends for two person carry too. Good construction."
3,Not as good as the first two and repetitious,"I found the third CD of Ghazal to be repetitious, as though they had said everything they had to say in the first two albums. Undoubtedly the musicianship is excellent but in terms of compositions and creativity, it was much less exciting and very ""deja vu"". Too bad! I had expected such wonderful musicians to expand beyond and not to just adhere to a formula that had worked before."
2,Not Up to par.,"The area of usability is rapidly expanding in the publishing world. There are 2 pillars, JaKob Nielsen, and now Steve Krug. Nielsen geared to the experience user, with very specific and structure and specifics on desing. Krug, aims at the casual user. Both produced great books. Veen seems to be a tweener, his approach is not as simple and forward as Krug, and not nearly as detailed as Nielsen. I found the book to be of little value. It had a few good points, and I learned a couple of new things, but I would recomend Nielson and Krug, and rate Veen's book a very distant 3rd."
1,There ARE better books out there,"I was disappointed by Veen's book. It seemed very banal, because, to me, he just appeared to be giving his opinion on a bunch of sites, and what was even worse, some of those ""favorites"" no longer exist. I would only suggest this book for the most novice of web designers, and not someone who's been ""in the game"" for a while."
3,Excellent Historic Overview,"This little book is an excellent survey of Portugal's ""Golden Age of Discovery"". From Macao to Mozambique, a compact yet detailed history of how the Portuguese discoverers 'opened' the globe to European expansion."
5,Toxic relief,Here's a doctor who really cares about you and your health. Juicing helps me feel more alive. I like the red beet and sweet potato recipe. There's a big difference with Dr. Colbert with teaching how to care for your mind and body. Instead of writing out just a prescription with tons of side effects and out the door you go. Christian means love and care for everyone. I think more people would go to the doctor if there were more doctors like Dr. Colbert. It's a great book to experience excellent health.
3,Good Info,"This book has a lot of good information but I have to keep second guessing Dr Colbert because some of this is from left field. The book also made me feel very paranoid about everything consumed by the body, whether it's light, liquid, solid or air. I want to live in a bubble."
1,Waste Software,Waste Software I have ever owned. Caused constant system instability. Cannot even use my internet connection while this software is installed.
4,No Latin,"This book does not, in fact, contain the Latin original, and nor does the second volume. Apparently, the editor did not have time to edit the Latin, so he did not include it. Also, the Anglo-Saxon version is taken from two virtually identical manuscripts, which are printed on facing pages, making it twice as long as it needs to be. The Modern English translation spans the bottom third of the two pages, so it is easy to glance at while translating. It is a great book to practice Anglo-Saxon with, as it is relatively easy to read."
5,BEHIND THE SCENES WITH BSB,"When I saw this video, I loved it because it showed the guys being themselves. Doing what comes naturally. I have all the other videos and this one by far is the best. If you can only get one video, this one is the ONE! I am an older fan of BSB. And no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy this video."
5,THE BEST VID OF ALL TIME!,THIS VIDEO ROCKED! I LOVED HOW IT WENT ALL TOGETHER. THIS WILL BE THE VIDEO THAT I'LL ALWAYS WHAT TO KEEP. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I WANT TO KEEP WATCHING THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. AND OVER. IT'S GREAT AND I LOVED WHEN THEY INTERVIEWED THEM. THIS DESERVES MUCH MORE THAN ONE STAR... THIS VIDEO IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME!
3,We love for you review his video,"I have 14 years old, i from Bolivia and i fanatic for A BACKSTREET Boy"
5,Wonderful video that displays the fun side of the BSB,"I just love this video because of the fun side it brought out of the guys. It also showed how hardworking they are, especially when I saw Nick taking a rest in the camper and saying,""I'm so tired;we've been rehearsing all night,"" and smiling anyway. I enjoyed Brian's great humor and how he really makes everyone smile and laugh-he really is someone that is cherished by everyone. I especially loved the funny moment between Nick and Howie in the middle of their As Long As You Love Me video making. Their interaction really displayed how really close the guys are, and the rarity of their relationship as other people in the background look on at their antics. It's a great video that shows off their fun side without compromising their maturity."
5,The Best,"This video is so awesome! A.J. himself takes you on the set of ""Backstreet's Back."" Then, my favourite part, there's the making of ""As Long As You Love Me."" It's so incredibly funny! After that, you see a few of their videos and concert clips. Trust me, this video is worth the money! :)"
2,teeny,"I bought this ""Large Bird Toy"" my cockatoo. It was so small she didn't know what to do with it so she threw it off the table. It may be okay for a parakeet, but not a ""Large Bird"" like a cockatoo."
1,"Cute, but terrible quality","I thought this item was super cute (I bought the matching floormats and trash bag, too). Unfortunately, as soon as I installed it it started crumbling, leaving neoprene powder all over the driver's area of my car. I sent it back, and now I have to vacuum. :("
5,WHAT A DEAL ON THE BEST,"I was considering this Milwaukee nail gun at $172. = then a few weeks later I saw it at $232. darn the price went up.But then out of curiosity, I later checked back and saw it at $149. SOLD...It arrived in perfect condition, you need to buy an adapter ( 3/8"" NPT toa 1/4"" industrial body so it fits the 1/4"" connector on your hose)I love this thing = no jams, light weight and much lighter than my previous Porter Cable. I would highly recommend this nailer and especiallyif Amazon drops the price ... consider it too good to be true. A GREATVALUE. P.S. It uses 22* nails without a hitch."
4,Framing,The gun is great it works better then my other gun.There is some plastic on the gun but it makes it very light to handle.
3,A Real Nailbiter,"I had soem reservations about reading this book as some Shatner books in the past werent well written in my opin. However, this book is a real nailbiter and smacks of dark realism, even though its landscape is science fiction 101. The last twenty pages, most entailing the last great battle are nerve wracking and well written. Definitely would like to see more of Benton Hawkes."
3,Currently reading,I am a student at Houston Baptist University and I am currently reading this book as part of a course that studies the Old Testament. Surely there are better texts that discuss the translations of the Old Testament
5,THIS MAN CAN REALLY SING,"I was a fan of Take That, but since Mr. Barlow went solo, I have a greater appreciation for his voice. This man has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard on a man. The songs are awesong, romantic, fun, and you just want to listen to them over and over."
3,Need better rearrangements and sound engineering,"As a Gary Barlow fan, i tried hard to like this cd. It is an improvement over 'Open Road'. It has upbeat tempo like 'Arms Around Me' and 'For All That You Want', which by the way is the same 'SuperHero' song in the North American release of the Open Road album, with one line changed. It also has some nice ballads like 'All that I've Given Away'. The problem is a lot of the songs have simple rearrangements and are marred by poor sound engineering. Some songs sound like Gary is singing behind a curtain or something. Don't get me wrong. He sings very well. It is the sound quality of the cd I am talking about.Nice thing about the cd is it is also an enhanced cd rom. Elegant interface. It includes two videos. BTW the enchanced cd rom does not work on a mac though one should be able to open the video files to play them."
2,A nonbeliever's view of the papacy,"Although it would be nice to have a thorough biography of the popes, it should be written by someone who shares a Catholic perspective of the papacy. This book does not."
3,It helps if you are/were a Mormon...,"This movie has nothing to do with ""Plan 9"" by Ed Wood.The movie is a Science Fiction satire of Mormon theology.If you don't know much about Mormon theology and the culture of the Mormon church, the movie is not going to make a whole lot of sense to you.The movie is about how Brigham Young's 26th wife was actually an alien (Played by Karen Black) and how she takes her revenge on the inhabitants of Utah as told by a young woman writer. (As described in the ""Plaque of Nehor"".)The movie is not perfect by any means, but has its moments of surreal charm.Show this to your ex-Mormon friends. They will get a kick out of it."
4,Very Cute!!,This was at Wal-Mart for $1.00 and my daughter who is 4 years old just HAD to have it and she LOVES it and watches it all the time! lol.
1,Do not buy,"Curtain description stated 1 inch header when I ordered. Package said 1.5"" header. There was no header, just one huge hole for the curtain rod. I ordered 3 curtains. Two were the same length and the third was a couple inches longer. Amazon was wonderful in returning the items and giving my money back."
1,McAfee Ships Defective Product,"Despite three attempts at installing this product under W98SE (updated) on one machine, and once on another, including adding QuickClean online updates, this product failed to operate properly.A couple of hours on McAfee's online chat tech support produced only repetitive instructions to keep reinstalling, then the techie cut off the session. Earlier he stated McAfee does not replace defective product.Additionally, there, are many key places where the sparse printed manual, and the online help do not agree with the runtime software.Thus, we cannot suggest this program as useful for undoing application installations, or its other functions. Perhaps it does work if you can get a working installation disk, but don't expect to get one from the manufacturer."
1,Does not work,"Product is simply horrible. After 2 attempts to get it to work, I just gave up. Apparently, this product is still rather buggy and the folks in on-line help have no clue. To make matters worse, they don't have telephone help unless you are willing to pay. Call me crazy but I think it's the company responsibilties to provide personal support for free. On-line help doesn't work well because you constantly have to reboot in order to see if the problem is resolved.....which terminates your connection to the help desk."
3,how and why a real tribute to rush,"i feel that the artists on the cd are out dated i brought the cd thinking if you are going to do rush you should get artiststhat are up to dated like madonna or tool if she were on the cd sing subdivisions instead of randy jackson it would be better and she would give the song more respect i don,t mind the adding to the songs with solos .madonna - subdivisionstool - tearsp.o.d - tom sawyerfaith hill- differnet stingsinstead of get artists are past their prime i am glad that the artist didn,t copy them like the working man one did . i am waiting for all star tribute to them. it flawed"
2,Couldn't agree more with Dr. Gershom Martin...,"First thing, RUSH is a statement of a Band. And thus, I also can understand the purpose for any tribute.But being a fan for many years; apreciating the gift those 3 great musicians give us and having a high level of expectation from who would even try to achieve such project, I've got to agree that it would take a whole more than a standard degree of musicianship to really pay tribute to them.Having said that, I coudn't think of any other Band than Dream Theater, to give justice to what may indeed turn out to be an awesome tribute..."
4,Excellent,"Not only was the price low, but the receipt was discreet, for those who wish not to make public information their purchases. The shipping was quick. Overall, no complaints here"
3,Incredibly Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this DVD. Project Pitchfork is an awesome band, but the DVD doesn't do them justice. I could only get through 15 minutes because the vocals and video don't match up. What's the point of watching the DVD when you can't enjoy the performance?"
1,When was this LP updated?,"I was overall disappointed.The guide was useful to plan the trip, but much less once on the spot. Quite a bit of information is erronous or outdated (e.g. restaurants/hotels do not exist or are priced over double of what stated, museums have been closed or moved), which especially in Moscow and Yekaterinenburg led to cross-city walks and travels at the end of which we found nothing. This is especially for what concerns the Moscow to Yekaterinenburg part; pages on St. Petersburg, China, Mongolia and the Irkutsk area were much more useful.Train and bus info: there is quite a lot of information if you are heading in the St. Petersburg to Beijing direction, but no special indications for if you are taking the opposite direction.Last point: guide suggestions are generally targeted to a welthier-than-backpacker budget (though Galina in Moscow was great!)."
2,a disappointment,I rather hoped for a bit more than these childish click art junk.very disappointed in the selection and the quality.
2,Unusable,"I can't really comment on the type of artwork that's here (although PC World said it's a nice variety), because it doesn't work on my computer! It is admittedly an older CD (which I got second hand), but with my new laptop having Windows 7, it says the CD is incompatible.Just thought I'd warn anyone thinking about getting this!"
5,I bought a second copy!,"I found a copy of ""Reinventing Home"" at a thrift shop, and couldn't put it down. Six working women describe various aspects of their life journeys, centered around their various living spaces and how they loved or hated where they lived. How objects and places had meaning for themselves and their families. How the mechanics of being a homemaker (for even working women make homes for themselves and their families) became a part of their understanding of ""This is who I am."" Highly recommended as a peek into women's psychology in 20th (and 21st!) century America."
4,UK version - Hotwheels size Cars,"These guys are the UK version of the Cars figures. Apparently, the Disney stores over there wanted the size of the cars to match the size of Matchbox/Hotwheels cars (so they could be used interchangeably). If you have other US Cars figures, you'll know they are too big to be used in typical Matchbox/Hotwheels toys racetracks, etc."
2,"Good sound, poor reliability!","Three weeks after having the unit home, I came home one evening to find it brightly lit, with no characters on the display. No buttons functioned, it would not turn off, the CD door would not open (with three of my CDs loaded inside), and there was that telltale pungent odor of burning electronics. All this occurred after the unit had been OFF for several days. Having read another review dealing with Emerson's reliability issues, I decided to return the unit and upgrade to a Panasonic 5-disc system. The speakers were better and Panasonic does not have the overall reliability problems Emerson seems to have. But, with the Panasonic, I lost that subwoofer out that I liked so much in the Emerson. Bottom line, check out the Emerson. It has a lot of nifty features for the price. If you can take a chance on the reliability issues, you'll have a fine-sounding micro system at a mini price."
4,wanted a little more,"This is a good dvd, however I was expecting more zill patterns. Also, it went just a bit too fast, so I had to keep rewinding. Overall worth the money(discounted) I paid for it."
3,Whatever happened to.....?,"Scratch the Surface is a documentary made by former model Tara Fitzpatrick who interviews the models that she worked with in her youth. The insights offered by her peers are not particularly noteworthy, but I bought this dvd because I was a teenager during the time these ladies were modelling and I was one of the many young girls fascinated by these young ladies and followed them month to month ""Seventeen"" magazine. I always wondered what happened to them and although the documentary doesn't reveal much, it does give a glimpse of what they are up to now."
3,So Great yet So Bad,in synopsis.....this DVD looks and sounds UNBELIEVABLE....the editor should never work again....I'm really not interested in the women that attended the show....I bought this thing to watch a concert...It is such a let down because of how great the quality is yet you never get a shot of what you would actually be looking at if you were at the show....all reviewers are right when they say that this DVD will give you a headache....or just plain agitate you...but the set list for acts 1 and 3 is fantastic....with the exception of Going Blind...set 2 is for teenage girls...I would buy it again...but instead of watching this concert often...I probably will only throw it in once or twice a year
2,"Seemed Great,But......","I was looking forward to this concert,as I have the CD,whichsounds awesome,But the DVD seems to be jumbled.Too many fastchanges between scenes,you can't focus on any one person.Toomuch time spent on audience.You never have the camera on longenough for a whole song!It almost made me motion sick.It soundsawesome,but whoever edited this needs to find another line ofwork.Disappointing.."
4,dvdecent,this is a good dvd if youre a kiss fan - couldve just been 1 dvdand saved us 10 bucks-but thats not how gene simmons does business.my problem is how kiss has gone pg 13 on us...id like to see themrelease kiss confidential on dvd-their live show from the revengetour...at least when they cut to the crowd and showed hot babespulling up their shirts they didnt cut away and make us miss theaction- dvds are all about pausing and zoomin in on these momentsbut none on this dvd -
3,An average offering,"This book will be a disappointment to subscribers of Martha Stewart Living because many of the ideas contained in the book have been previously published in the magazine. It's essentially a collection of Martha's ""Good Things"" for keeping things in the house organized, quick cooking tips, nifty ways of peeling vegetables, mixing drinks, making place settings, etc. While I did not really find the book that interesting, because I had seen the ideas before in her magazine, the ideas themselves are excellent, easy and have a 'why-didn't-I-think-of-that' element to them. It would make a perfect housewarming gift for a young person moving into their first apartment or home."
2,Too many problems,"After I loaded this, I had a bunch of issues with my system. Several friends that have also purchased the product have reported the same types of problems. I have had previous versions of VirusScan so this one is a little disappointing."
3,McAfee VirusScan 6.0 has bugs of its own.,"I have always extolled the virtues of McAfee VirusScan. I say this in the past tense because the latest version of McAfee has enough bugs of its own to make a getting a virus almost attractive by comparison. I have spent a great deal of time on their online technical support. Here's just one example: Windows/Temp/Zip files send it for a loop -- literally. It sits there and scans the same Temporary Zip files, over and over and over again. You have to abort the scan, which kind of defeats the purpose of performing a system scan.Considering that it has captured 5 computer viruses in my email inbox this week alone, VirusScan is still a worthwhile program; I just hate to see Network Associates join the other big software companies in marketing annoying software that is not yet ready for prime time."
1,TotallyDisgusted,"To avoid sharing the rant with you all, this product is so bad McAfee will have to pay people to take their version 7.x. They have crippled their image. This is what happens when you write code on the cheap...offshore ... in India...by trainees. The product is awful, the support for it is even worse."
3,Not as good as 5,"I have been using McAfee for almost 7 years, and have always been very hapy - until I installed version 6. The new ""interface"" is extremely difficult to use compared to previous versions, and the firewall program (now uninstalled) caused several services on my Win2000 Pro machine to fail at boot."
1,Bad Product!,"This product is very, very buggy in XP. While there may be fixes from McAfee, their own update program has bugs in XP. Check out Microsoft's site for their own documentation on problems with McAfee. Don't waste your time, even when the product comes for free with rebates!"
1,Mcafee customer support is the WORST. An utter nightmare.,"I purchased this software after trying unsuccessfully to download VirusScan Online SIX TIMES. The Mcafee website is so truly awful its scary - to login to their website you have to either delete all of your cookies, or reset your Internet security option in Internet Explorer. Totally unacceptable! Their technical support chatroom staff are totally inexperienced call-center people who enter in pre-written statements that dont answer questions. After I typed in my entire problem, explaining that i could not login and activate my account, the rep responded ""Did you login and activate your account?"". Totally infuriating. Technical support for Mcafee products is ridiculous. If you want to speak to someone on the phone, its extremely ... if you try to get help through the website, you get no telephone numbers, only directions to use the useless chat feature. Go with NORTON instead!"
1,This program is full of bugs and it's getting worse!,"It took me quite a while to get this program installed on Win XP Professional due to numerous bugs.Don't be deceived by the Microsoft Win XP compatibility claims on the box. Much of the support information including updates to the program don't cover XP. For example, I had trouble getting the settings to be retained. The instructions McAfee Technical Support sent me only covered Win 9x and ME even though I told them I was running XP.The good news is that since I installed the latest patch the problem with the settings being retained is gone, that bad news is that the settings problem is gone because I can no longer start McAfee Virus Scan at all."
1,Protection at the annoying expense of system crashes .,"I purchased and installed MVS6 on three systems: Win98, WinME and Win2000. On all three operating systems error messages constantly appear: Rulaunch failure, an ""unknown"" failure on Firewall boot, and cpdclnt.exe fails to respond (and hangs windows). In addition, my Iexplorer.exe encounters invalid page faults only when FireWall is running. And finally, VirusScan periodically fails to start on the Win2000 and WinME system, without warning or notification (gives a false sense of security). I spent days (equivalent) with technicians in their online ""tech support,"" which resulted in finger pointing at other companies.While McAfee has provided the best in Virus protection in the past, this product should have gone through more beta testing prior to release.I highly recommend finding an alternative product... And for those that purchased it-- I hope you got the rebate!"
1,McCafe Following Unfair Bussiness Practices,"It has been a nightmare experience with this worst kind of product. It is piece of junk. And on top of that, the product support is non-existing. And if you will try to return the product for refund, you will be given a hell of a time by McCafe. And they never refund money to you. They always find some excuse or the other tto delay the processing so that ultimately the person will stop asking for refund. McCafe should be banned from selling any product."
1,It doesn't work under win-me,"My computer is a new toshiba laptop with a pre-installed win-me system and a macfee anti-virus shield (i don't know what version it is because it can never be upgraded or provide more information other than suggestion for purchasing another macfee product).I bought this software (Macfee version 6)shortly after it is released. Even from the first day it is installed into my computer, it started a war against the older version of macfee...I tried every way I can think of to solve this problem. But these two brothers just wouldn't settle down."
1,"Not happy with product, want to return for refund",This item did not work as stated. The few times the key finder did beep after clapping it was a faint beep and very hard to hear. I have e-mailed 2 times about returning this item for a refund and have not heard from the seller yet.
3,good song and good costumes,good costumes when dancing. when dancing in the big group at the end of song the costumes doesn't make you look together it looks a bit messy. apart from that every thing was great and i like the song alot.
2,First time with a bluetooth headset,"A very short range and low audio quality have led me to rate this device very low. I'm a first time headset purchaser, so I don't know if this is typical or not which is why I gave the headset a little bit of room by rating it a 2 instead of a 1."
2,Cheap Useless Radio,"Probably the worst radio I have used. No range over open water, very hard to get through menu, good to monitor other traffic that is close, but that's about all. I have many different radios on my boats and at the dock houses and this is by far my worst purchase."
1,Does not work!!!!!!!!,"Rceived radio in a timely manner. Problem is that the radio does not work as described in the directions. I could not get any channels except 16, 9 and 1. Also would not let me select the weather band along with other problems! Sent radio back and ordered another one. Had the same prolem with it and sent it back for a refund. Ordered a Uniden radio, hope it works......"
1,What a shame,"This Nautico 1 radio is, without doubt, the least user friendly, most absurdly programmed piece of electronics gear I've ever been exposed to.I challenge ANYONE to effectively use this radio without having the owner's manual in front of them.It is IMPOSSIBLE to change channels, truly. What an absurdity."
1,I thought better...,"I wish I could return this item..it has a serious charging issue. Does not charge and knocks out after an hour, if not less. Terribly disappointed. The battery does not charge fully. In my haste to use the item the box was thrown away. If I still has it, it would be returned! Bad choice..."
3,Not quite ideal,"The item is well made and durable. I have found that the U-shaped end with the pin does not work all that well with my wife's bike. This is because her handlebars are raised somewhat so the tension bar allows the front end of the bike to hang down a bit lower on the bike rack than I prefer. It is late fall now and we've only used the tension bar a few times, but over the winter I will determine if I can modify and improve how the bar fits on my wife's bike."
5,Easy to use,"Easy to use makes the bike ez to transport . The price was right , great little product . Love it"
4,allens cross bar,I never had one of theae and thought they would be a joke!! But after having one of these this is a must have for womens bikes. They hold the bike level and makes it a hole lot easy and sfe loading and hauling the bike. A+++ love it
4,Chermm,Used it acouple times. It takes alittle getting used to but once you get the hang of it it works well to get your bike on the rack easier.
