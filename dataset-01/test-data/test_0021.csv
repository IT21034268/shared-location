5,NEVER POUR MESSY POWDER OR LIQUID AGAIN!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best product on the market today. Why isn't it the only laundry cleaner on the shelf? You leave it in your washer, never take it out, and it washes clothes beautifully! It is way cheaper than the very cheapest powder or liquid. The company has pulled this product due to poor customer purchases...what's wrong with you people? Try something new and you might like it! Clamor for this...write to Oxy Clean!!!!!"
5,An excellent record of what it was like...,"It is very well written, and has a lot of detail about what it waslike.These critics that give this book such low ratings in the reviews...- My hats off to you for reading through the whole book.Not one of your favorite books, huh? Is there too muchtruth in it for you?:-)Loved the book. If you call yourself a Democrat and a caringAmerican, read this book with no prejudice. It is all fact,as borne by the lack of any real culpability in Whitewater,FBI scandal, Paula Jones etc. Most impressive is of course,the fact that Clinton got so much DONE despite all of thisinquisition.I was most fascinated by the connection between Naderand the right-wing."
4,Good but not objective,"This book contains a lot of good information and is quite well written. It is not objective, however. The author spends most of his time complimenting Clinton and his policies/strategies. It's not quite as bad as being told Reagan's presidency was a time when ""Character was King"", but it does wear on you after a while."
5,Texacana at it's best,Great book on the Texas Rangers. The book is easy reading and tells the story of McNelly's rangers throught the eyes of a Young Ranger named Ed Durhm. Would make a good movie.
3,Consider this...,"This has some boom for its size, NOT crisp however. I put this in the trunk of a luxury sedan with a 200 watt (RMS) amp. I could barely hear it. I would highly recommend this tube if its going to be in the CABIN OF YOUR VEHICLE ONLY. If youre looking for a tube in the trunk, you must go with a 10 inch minimum. Hope this helps."
2,Submarines,"While this film looks and sounds very much like a documentary on Submarines, its merely a mediocre drama that deals with terrorists and a hijacked Russian nuclear Sub!! If this sounds like your bag then this film could be for you. I thought it to be an interesting Documentary but found I was wrong. It was just packaged to appear that way."
1,Who approved this listing?,"Ok, guys, help me out here. I see a listing for Mazuri Koi Pond Nuggets for some dollar amount, but I can't find the quantity anywhere in the listing. What am I buying, a 2-oz sample, 2 lbs, 20 lbs, a truck-load? Who approved this listing anyway?"
2,This is not music,"If you like drum thumping, bells jingling, and vocals that sound like guttural noises, buy this CD. There are no real instruments. It's VERY authentic stuff. Recording quality is good, but if you're looking for a toe-tapper ---this isn't it. It sounds like noise to me."
3,Old but authentic,"I used to have an audiotape with many of these songs on it which I got 20 years ago. I think these songs might have been originally recorded on wax cylinders, hence the scratchy quality. The songs are old, maybe from around 1900 to 1930s. These songs are not like the ones you will find at modern powwows today but are a rare collection of the old-time songs from another era. Geared more toward the serious student rather than the casual listener. For powwow music, I would recommend any of the more modern releases."
1,Not Recommended - Poor Sound Quality,"Unless you are willing to put up with poor sound quality - do not purchase this CD. I returned it immediately as my HiFi reproduced the CD 'as is' - including the poor quality recording. It was not pleasing to the ears.I highly recommend Sacred Spirit, Vol. 2: More Chants and Dances of the Native Americans and Sacred Spirit: Chants and Dances of the Native Americans. I have not got over them yet and I consider them the finest of Native American music. I purchased them at the Grand Canyon during our tour of the USA. They are currently in promotion at Amazon.(Discounted price)."
3,A disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Holly, I loved Hunting Midnight and The Demon's Daughter but this one was a serious disappointment. Lucias was a confused and confusing hero, the heroine (I can't even remember her name) was annoying and boring. In fact this book was very confusing and not very memorable. She introduces too many characters and everyone has sex on the brain. Next time, I think I would to prefer to have a plot."
5,It's fun,"Yes, some reviews seem a bit true, but a little too harsh.The movie is a riot.. and funny. I thought Woody would bea poor selection as a FBI agent, but being older and showinga serious side, he turned out excellent for the part.I enjoyed the characters, the humor, and music.Buy it and enjoy a good laugh.. it's fun!"
5,The absolute BEST in hip-hop! WHAT MORE do you want?!!,"THIS IS THE BEGINNING!The hardcore groundbreaking album by BDP is definitely up there with the greatest rap albums of all time.Key cuts: Poetry, the debut single with a trademark James Brown scream;9mm goes Bang, a reggae-driven tale of street revenge;South Bronx, the tale of where HIP HOP STARTED!The Bridge is Over, a classic ""diss"" record aimed at then-rival MC Shan. They're pals now, though...Dope Beat, the most hard-rocking track which samples AC/DC's ""Back In Black"", making an influential rap/metal combo.ANYBODY who is interested in hip hop MUST have this album. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY WAY AROUND IT!!!"
2,NOT worth the money..,"Don't waste your money on this, it is overpriced and I did not notice a difference in my hair while using it. Try Loreal's Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture instead!"
5,Back to my childhood!,"Johnny Tremain, originally came out when I was 10 years old and I hadn't seen it since then! It was fun to go back and see it at age 61! They don't make many pictures like this, great family entertainment! But you always expect that from Walt Disney!"
2,"Accurate, I think not!","As a Disney movie of the 1950's, Johnny Tremain is alright, that is if you don't mind the incredible number of mistakes and errors litter throughout the film. Based on an exceptional book by Esther Forbes, the Disney film essentially rewrites key elements in the book, makes pointless changes in the plot development, cuts out the more interesting supporting characters and leaves you with a santitized verison of the months leading up to the Revolutionary War. My advice, read the book and gain an authentic view of the courageous men and women who risked all they had to bring about America's independence from Great Britain. The film is best considered as a piece of Disney nostalgia."
2,Johnny Tremain,Not much action in this film until the very end. My 6 year old couldn't understand the sophisticated dialogue. However this film may be interesting to a child (9 yr old) who has studied the American Revolutionary War. Some history is changed.
5,Johnny Tremain - excellent movie!,I bought this movie for my husband....he had wanted it and so I looked and found it on Amazon.com. Fast shipping and the DVD is new. He has already watched it several times and is very happy. Disney makes excellent movies.
2,No Justice done to the book,The book was alot better than the book. Disney changed to many key details which gave the book more adventure. They also added some unneeded pasts in the video. The book was historical fiction and I give it 5 stars.
1,Get an ipod,"Not user friendly, unable to load music onto mp3. Spent 3 hours already trying to figure this out. I thought it would be a better system for running i.e. smaller size but just too hard to use. I will be purchasing an ipod over the weekend. I would not recommend purchasing. Yepp studio software, can not begin to compare to itunes. Spend the $299 on the ipod. You won't regret it."
3,Thunder Doesn't Always Roll,"Pam Tillis has had a plethora of hits since entering the scene in the early 90's, but rarely manages to put together an overall seamless album, the exceptions being '92's HOMEWARD LOOKING ANGEL and '94's SWEETHEART'S DANCE. Her later albums have been slightly uneven, featuring some good songs, but not a consistently overall great record. The pattern unfortunately continues with THUNDER AND ROSES, which manages to update her sound by adding pop production sheen in an effort to compete in the current market. First single 'Please' is decent, and she manages to better Tina Arena's 'If I Didn't Love You'. The rest of the album is sorta just there, nicely put together but nothing that reaches out and grabs you."
3,Easy read,Light fare for a relaxing read. Nice to have a story involving EMS. A little romance goes a long way. Clean read for younger audience.
2,Fragile Finklestein,"Not a very durable toy. Don't expect to be able to move and pose him very much. He's very fragile. Right after I took him out of the package and tried to pose him, his arm fell off. Now I have to worry about his other joints and trying to super glue the arm that fell off. Just be careful with this toy. And don't pay too much for it!"
5,Excellent!!,"In 1979, after almost 15 years of hard work and establishing themselves in Japan and Europe, the Scorpions finally made a dent in America with their masterpiece entitled Lovedrive. This half-hour of music, with the Schenker Brothers (Michael and Rulolph) and Matthais Jabs on guitar, shows you the many great sides of the Scorpions. From the hard rocking ""Lovedrive"" and ""Another Piece of Meat"" to the great Instrumental ""Coast to Coast"" to the Arabian sounding ""Is There Anybody There?"" to the closing acoustic ballad ""Holiday"", the Scorpions show off all of their talents. Twenty One years later, this album still pulls its weight. Although it looks a little skimpy at just over 30 minutes, this was a time when a band put an album out every year, not once every 2 or 3 years. Aside from the great music from start to finish, the influence this album has had on bands is irreplacable"
3,"Not as good as 1,2 or 3","Although I enjoy the way that Mark Nesbitt weaves the history of a place I love with the telling of ghost stories (the combination is WICKED!), volume 4 left me feeling like I have read it all before. Volumes 1, 2 and 3 are fresher, and the words draw you into both the battle and paranormal experiences. Volume 4 is a $5 commercial for the new ghost tours. Read the other volumes for a less commercial collection of stories."
4,The Heiress and the Sheriff,"I picked this book up at a local store because the cover and title intriqued me last Friday. Sat down on the couch that afternoon and started reading and finished it that night. Thoughly enjoyed the story of the distrustful of women Sheriff Wyatt Grayhawk and the amnesia victim Gabrielle. I did not realize until near the end of the book that this was one of the 12 books in the Fortunes of Texas Series. Characters from these books are interwoved in this book and since I enjoyed ""The Heiress and the Sheriff"" so much I ordered the other eleven books so I can read about the other ""Fortune"" characters. Well worth the time I spent reading it instead of doing house work, also had a balony sandwich for dinner so I could eat in one hand and hold the book in the other to read. Cannot wait until the other books to arrive to read more about these great characters."
5,Real R&B Music,"With The Vault,Vol 1.5 Eric Roberson gives fans and real R&B music fans what the world is missing which is good old fashioned soul music. The Vault features winning tracks such as the steppers groove Rock With You and the thought provking Def Ears and the smooth Pasttime Paraside. If given a chance go and see Mr.Roberson live because he's one of the few cats doing real music."
4,Fun Health Crisis Melodrama,"The TV equivalent to Outbreak or the Andromeda Strain, This one starts with a sick girl on plane to NYC and unfortunatley starts to infect a lot of people. Jackson is the State medical gal workin with the CDC on the viral outbreak. For a TV film it has some pretty intense and frightening scenes and like other films of this ilk, really makes you think about what could happen. Well done ann credible thriller."
5,Remembering...,"I remember reading this book when I was a teenager. My mother had it (can't find it anymore) - and I recall being struck by the personal nature of this monumental news item, occurring many years before I was even born. Out of 2200+ people, so many were lost - and recorded in this book by name. I set out a while ago to try to find the book. I was pleased to have found it through Amazon. It arrived in a timely manner and in very good shape. Now I discuss the long-ago event with a grandson and discussed some of the things in the book.R.McMillenMassillon, Oh"
5,Only Walter Lord can write something this magnificent !,"This book is a must read! I enjoyed this book, just as much as I enjoyed ""Day of Infamy,"" also by Walter Lord. This is written only as Walter Lord can write it. He gives the minute-to-minute true story of how the passengers ignored the crew, how men snuck aboard lifeboats, and other extremelty interesting facts about the Titanic barely anyone knows. When you read this, you know how the people felt, how the people reacted, and how the atmosphere was on the saviour ship. Read it and enjoy it!"
4,Bare Bones Account,"Walter Lord is one of the best historical authors of the 20th Century. His storytelling talent shows through in his classic account of the sinking of the Titanic. The book's only flaw is its brevity. The narrative portion is only 135 pages in small paperback form and starts just as the ship is about to hit the iceberg. There is no background story to give the reader perspective of the ship's construction or of the passengers whose stories it follows. Also lacking is much detail about the aftermath of the sinking. The actual sinking is retold in riveting first person accounts that detail those fatal final moments and all of their tragedies and ironies. In fact, Lord's account was good enough to make me want to seek out a more complete history of the disaster."
5,A Night to Remember (Titanic),"Well...I've seen the movie, but reading this old version by Loyd really makes the tragic historic event an interesting read. I'm usually a fiction reader, but thoroughly reading this non-fiction novel about the Titanic. There's alot of stuff there that the movie doesn't cover, although I must admit, the movie depicts most of the facts well."
5,This book makes you feel like you are in the midst of it all,I'm still reading this book and it makes you never want to put it down. Every sentence makes you feel like you are really on the ship watching every move being taken. A definite best-seller to me!
3,OK Titanic book,"It's alright to read. Read a lot of Walter Lord's books as a kid but, re-reading them as an adult, they seem to loose something."
1,DO NOT READ THAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!,I read that book 3 months ago and I can say without a dought that this is the worse book I have ever read in my life. This book is just a series of pointless facts that everyone already knows. I am personnaly very interested in the Titanic and what happened to it and after reading that I had not learn anything and was truly disapointed. I would not recommend that book to anyone unless the person is in search of facts about the Titanic.
5,Minute to Minute Book about the last night of RMS Ttitanc,"Starting with the lookout fleet seeing the first ice-berg, Walter Lord's The Night to Remember novel begins. W.Lord had truly grasped every angle of everything that happened from the hitting of the ice-berg to the Carpathia arriving at New York with thousands of people waiting to meet their friends or relatives. He interviewed most of the survivors, which made every word of the novel more realistic, and more fascinating. The survivors had also provided almost the exact words of what the passengers or the crew had said. For example, the only baker who survived, had provided W. Lord with thousands of information about the bakery when the ship was starting to tilt, such as providing bread for one of the lifeboats. Very fascinating, very exciting, truly amazing. This book had used thousands of help from suvivors, and of course, uncountable efforts by Walter Lord."
4,"Detail, accuracy and a few typesetting errors","I've read quite a few books about the Titanic, and this one is a stand-out in its detail and accuracy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it focuses almost entirely on the night of the disaster, and little on events before and afterwards, but also that it combines the best of both worlds - hindsight and eyewitness accounts.I noticed three places shortly after the middle of the book where it appears lines have been scrambled or omitted, but apart from that, this kindle edition is well worth a read by anyone who wants to know what really happened."
3,Titanic Detail and Some Enjoyment,"Overall, an insightful look into one of the most momentous events in our history. It does tend to drag on a bit in points because it goes into such depth with individual stories but some of these are deliciously entertaining. Take the good with the dull and don't feel bad if you can't keep the dozens of names which are thrown around straight in your head."
5,Memorable,"Walter Lord's book may not contain the very latest findings on the Titanic sinking but it is well written and a quick read well worth the time spent. There is a good reason this book is still in print and considered a classic account. Timeless writing from an author who personally spoke with many of the people who survived the ""Night To Remember""."
4,good,i rate this cover good it fits nicely over the grill and bottle. I use the 17lb bottle and its nice and snug. just wish it was a little heavier in material.
1,"Tex Avery's Screwball Classics, Vol. 3 VHS","I bought this from Gayle and Zak from Plano, Texas and it came in broken. And amazon does not reburse any open VHS items. How else can you tell that the tape is not broken by not opening it."
4,NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS,"WE LOVE OUR BREAD MAKER,THE WAY IT LOOKS, THE SIZE IS NOT REAL BIG, BUT WE HAVE FOUND YOU CAN'T JUST USE ANY BREAD MIX ON YOUR LOCAL STORES SHELF AND EXPECT A PERFECT LOAF OF BREAD. WE ARE FINDING THAT WITH THE SMALL BOOK THAT CAME WITH THE MAKER HAS A FEW WAYS TO MAKE BREAD IS THE BEST WAY TO GO, BUY THE BREAD FLOUR,YEAST AND WHAT EVER ELSE YOU NEED AND HAVE FUN WITH IT. BUT EXPECT THE FIRST FEW NOT TO COME OUT PERFECT.AFTER THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT. IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT,THANK YOU"
1,Burned out,"I bought this bread machine 6 months ago, and it burned out completely after three months. I didn't use it excessively, or cause it to burn out in any way. Also, the oversized control buttons on the unit felt cheaply made when pushed, and sometimes wouldn't push in properly. I would avoid this bread machine!"
1,Got a used machine!!!,"So, I took a chance even though many reviews said ""beware""... sure enough, I got the machine, opened the box, and the out side of the machine was all scratched, two of the buttons were nearly falling off, and the bread pan itself was deeply scratched. You can even see on the outside of the machine, on the chrome part, where someone had tried to sand out a deep scratch.Poor poor business!!!!!I'll never buy from Breadman again.Amazon was WONDERFUL and very patient with my blustering on the phone. Yay for Amazon!!!!"
1,Will not make a 2 lb. loaf,"I got this breadmaker because I've always bought Breadman breadmakers and I wanted a machine that was compact but still made 2 lb loaves of bread. This breadmaker was not it! Everytime I made a 2 lb. loaf that my other two breadmakers could easily handle, the loaf overran the sides of the pan and the loaf was burnt on the bottom and undercooked on top. I've since had to return the breadmaker because for the price, it wasn't worth buying this machine since really it could ONLY make 1.5 lb loaves of bread."
4,great product,"Tried out the bread maker the same nite i got it ; Worked perfectly,bread came out very good."
1,this is a junk,"I bought this on Nov. 2008, and started to use it after a month, and the first time it works fine, but the next time, while I just by curiosity opened the lid while the machine was kneading (which was perfectly legistimate by what the user manual said), the indicator light was suddenly went out, and the machine was down.and after that, I have tried several times, and no resurrection at all,I am very disappointed with this junk, not so cheap for me to forget it easily, which was my regret."
1,Gluten-free setting,The overall appearance of gluten free bread was poor. It lacked proper shape and texture.
1,Paddle stopped turning after the first dough cycle,"Tried to make cinnamon rolls for Christmas morning.... dough never kneaded completely - threw that batch away, made another one - paddle never moved! This machine is horrible!"
1,Missing bag of parts including the PADDLE!,Just an early review concerning packaging of the breadmaker. We bought two new breakmakers one of which is a gift. One is missing the bag of parts including the paddle! There are also some rough marks at the base of the unit where the pan could possibly rub. Makes me worry that we were given a refurbished unit or a returned unit although it looks new.I will update this inconvenience later but for now we will wait for the the parts that should have been included. This unit came from Amazon directly and not a vendor.
1,Customer DIS-service,"Wow, should have listened to the other low reviews on this unit- so heed my advice. Avoid this machine and this COMPANY at all costs. Bought this as a gift for the wife. Her first loaf never baked. So I attempted a loaf in case it was user error. I had a reading of E01 come onto the screen. I tried to call customer service and had to wait at least 20 mins. to talk to an actual human being. This person told me I would have to cut the cord and send it in with a copy of my receipt with $7.50 to have a new unit shipped. I thought it was ridiculous that I should have to pay to have a new unit shipped when they sold me a piece of crap. This has been a headache. I'm returning it to Amazon and buying a new unit from a better company. Don't be a fool as I was, avoid this machine."
1,Selling Reconditioned as New,I purchased this breadmachine as a new item and it came with the top & sides scratched and the side dented. I called and Amazon sent a replacement which was in almost the same condition. They said there was a problem with their ordering. When you select a certain item number it's pulling it as reconditioned. They hope to have it fixed in a week. I'm not sure if they even know what they are talking about. I'm looking elsewhere for the same model.
2,not worth the price,"I bought this during the daily deal for $59.99. It is SOOO not worth that price. Cleaned and turned on the rapid cycle as instructions said. Plugged it in to use hours later and kept getting ERROR message. Of course, the booklet did not state what the error code was. After fooling with the buttons, it finally started. The bread was very hard and dark for the medium setting. I assumed it was due to the rapid cycle. I add all my ingredients today and had to push buttons, unplug, push buttons, and unplug for the machine to start. This time I pressed the basic cycle. Bread came out like a hard piece of dough. Bread was not brown on the top or sides only the bottom.Going back tomorrow!"
1,Defective product,I received the bread machine three days ago and have tried to make bread but it will not start. The buttons do not work at all. It is clearly a defective product. I am returning mine back to Amazon and will buy a different bread machine. I liked the design of the machine and that is why I choose this one but it does not look like it is a well built machine.
1,Impossible,"I was excited to use my new Breadman for the first time because of the gluten free setting. I was really disappointed when I couldn't remove the bread pan from the machine. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get it out. Needless to say, we repackaged the Breadman and are shipping it back today!"
3,breadman bread machine.,"This is a nice machine and works very well, making a variety of different breads."
4,Great Machine for,"This machine makes great Gluten-Free bread in less than 90 minutes! It was very quiet, and the kids loved watching the dough rise through the clear window on top. For good instructions on how to make Gluten free bread with this machine, do not refer to the manual. Instead check out: [...]"
2,Heating defective,"Add me to the list that received a defective machine. I really like the style and the features of this machine. However, after a couple of loaves didn't turn out well, I finally realized that the pan just wasn't hot when I pulled it out of the machine. Amazon made it very easy to return, but I decided to buy a machine locally instead of ordering online again. I bought the Cuisinart CBK-200 2-Pound Convection Automatic Bread Maker. My first one burned the loaves, so it went back to the store. My second one has been working well for a couple of months now. I wish quality control was better for appliances like these."
5,Nice Bread Maker,I ordered this a few days before Christmas from Amazon.com and it arrived on time as stated. My wife loves it. She just needs to learn the little tricks to making the bread turn out perfect. She has tried it about four times so far. I will get back to you if we have any problems.
3,Beware refurbished sold as new!,"I just received this machine and have made several loaves of bread which turned out fantastic. I was trying to make jam but the machine would only act as if it were making bread, even though it displayed the jam function. As I was looking to see if anyone else had this problem I found out that others have received refurbished machines- that are sold as new through Amazon- and that Amazon is aware this has been an issue! Its a terrific bread machine but if you order one, make sure its new as advertised!"
3,"Good bread machine, terrible customer service","While this machine consistently makes tasty bread and is easy to use, the loaf pan fell apart in about a year. I've found it almost impossible to find a replacement. Breadman has had it on backorder for months and cannot tell me when it will be available. Not only that, they quoted me a price that was almost as much as the machine itself -- although I was able to I bargain them down. Meanwhile, their customer service department responded to my complaint only with an automatic email response. So,I'm left without a working bread machine for who knows how long. I'll try another company's bread machine next time."
3,It works ok,This is my first purchase for a Breadmaker. The items works OK but the bread does not get quiet done. It could use about 10 more minutes of baking time. I would not buy it again.
1,Don't order this breadmaker!,"I bought this breadmaker as a gift for my daughter and her husband. They loved the look of it but when they tried to make bread, it did not work! Unfortunately, they had tossed the box it came in so they were unable to return it. Obviously, I was out of a lot of money for a broken machine."
2,Makes great bread until it breaks,"I used this machine for less than a year before the mixing shaft in the breadpan froze. I emailed the company 5 months ago to get a replacement and was told that it was on backorder. Today when I called, they were willing to sell me a breadpan for $43 (since I couldn't find the receipt from 10 months prior), but there's no telling when I'm going to get it. The bread it makes is great, as long as it is working and you don't need new parts. Also, I was told by customer service that the mixing paddle was discontinued and can't be ordered.UPDATE: (3/21/2010)I just received the replacement breadpan. Unfortunately, it took them over a year from when it broke to get me the new pan, so I have already gotten rid of this bread machine. If anyone needs a breadpan, let me know because I have a new one sitting in a box."
1,Good for less than a month!,"I thought this was a great machine. I made several loaves of very good bread. But my second loaf of french bread(using the dough cycle only)the machine wasn't quite strong enough to get to the end of the cycle. Since then, even with the regular loaves of bread, the machine just doesn't have the power to get through the entire cycle.I waited a couple weeks before attempting the dough cycle for french bread again and the machine cut off 15 min before cycle was over. I am assuming the motor just isn't powerful enough. You could smell the motor running hot! Enough already! I will be shopping around for a different machine.Breadman TR875 2-Pound Breadmaker, Stainless Steel"
5,A book for both cat lovers and cat haters,"This is not a book of cute kittens doing adorable things. This is a book full of cats caught by the camera doing bizarre antics or simply looking hostile with captions to match. These images are from a website entitled ""MyCatHatesYou"" and is dedicated to showing the darker more feral side of the cat that seems to point to the possibility that cats don't care for people that much despite how much you may care for them. This is NOT a children's book. I say this because there is a book entitled ""Bad Cat"" that is a popular children's book and I would hate to have someone buy this for their child by mistake. If you like this book there are ""Bad Cat"" day planners and 365 page day calendars with even more ""bad cats""."
1,Funny? You've GOT to be kidding!,"Some cute photos, but the tag lines were inane, at best. I did find a good use for it, though. If you shred the pages lengthwise, the strips can be used to weave a ""paper"" that can be used in craft projects. So it wasn't a total loss."
5,Get ready to hold your sides from laughing so hard!,"This has to be the cutest book I've ever read. It has adorable pictures of kitties, sure to please all cat lovers, with cute little captions. I loved this book so much I bought one for my Mother-in-law for her birthday. She loves it, too. Its a great book. If you are a cat lover, or even if you aren't, you'll love this book."
5,bad cat,My cat is highlighted in this book. it is great and the service was too. got it on time and am enjoying it.
2,Not what I expected,"When I read ""Classical"" I expected Christmas songs and hymns. I was surprised and disappointed that it was truly Classical music, not anything I knew. As a very beginning harp student I was looking for examples that I could listen to and hope to learn from. Maybe in a few years???"
2,Not quite,"I've owned this for two months. So far, it's stayed together, but it's not particularly sturdy. Also, the only way this rack could hold 30 pairs of shoes is if those 30 pairs belonged to a child. A small one, at that. Men will not be impressed. There isn't a lot of height between the shelves, so my husband's shoes have to be manuevered in. Overall, this rack filled a need for us, but it certainly could have filled it much better."
2,DVD RELEASE BY DIMENSION IS BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,English dubbing is good with 5.1 Dolby. Sound effects editting is mediocre. Why can't they just leave the original sounds alone? I am huge fan of Jet and occasionally enjoy English dubbing on any martial arts movie. But this DVD version is a total turnoff! I highly recommend seeing the original version which is titled Fong Sai Yuk. You will not be disappointed!
5,American Version? Nope.,"Many people complain about how the American distributions are cut and dubbed and while I agree with their complaints, there is something that should be known. This particular product is indeed the version from Hong Kong. Yes, this is NOT the Dimension films (American) release. Apparently, it seems people just like to fight and be on the other ""esoteric"" side.Beside that, this is a great movie based on a Chinese folk hero (Fong Sai Yuk), like the Wong Fei Hong of about a hundred other movies including Once Upon a time in China.The other reviews do okay in describing it."
1,Don't buy this...,"The legend (1 & 2), originally ""Fong Sai Yuk (1 & 2)"" is/are maybe some of Jet Li's and China's best contributions to Kung-fu films (making, the ""Once....in China"" films look like tea-time)BUT, these versions are DUBBED, in English and unless you like your movies -- set nearly 100 years ago -- making random refrences to Nintendo, fast food, or COMPLETELY changing the entire story-line, get....FONG SAI YUK...If you want a movie, dubbed inconsistently (or wasted with american fodder), your better of getting KUNG-POW, enter the turkey, or Scarface (dubbed with new voices, for a kids network, with the scenes reordered, and the ending cut)"
3,Not the best of Jet Li,"I certainly enjoyed the movie, but in my opinion, the dubbing takes away from the movie experience. I would have preferred subtitles."
5,The art of Shoujo,"This book is great for those who want to learn to draw shoujo. It goes over how to draw the faces and bodies, gives examples of many types of hair for both males and females. goes over chibis, cute mascots, bishies and their eyes, different genres of shoujo, and much more! A must have!"
1,Not worth buying,"I do not recommend this book, even for children, because it will only discourage them and frustrate them. The images look like they were done by a child, proportions are often off and miscalculated, the line which are extremely important in manga/anime, look horrible, and the explanations are not thorough.You are basically told ""copy this drawing"" ratter then being though proper technics to be able to draw what you might want to draw.In short, this book was made by someone who knows very little about manga and anime style.For adults, i would recommend the 'how to draw manga' Series. There are numerous books covering just about any subject you may need help on, the art's quality is that of professionals, and the technics to drawing mangas are actually there.I recommend it to serious younger artists, too, with a slight warning as some subjects may contain some more mature content then others."
3,Botany of Desire,Although the movie itself was great I was very disappointed that it was not closed captioned as it claimed to be. As a deaf person who relies on closed captioning nothing is more frustrating....
5,Great information,Great information. We are using the schedule and techniques from the program and are very satisfied.
1,Tyrant no so Tender,"'Davina wasn't free to marry anyone. After the death of their parents, Davina Mawne was sole provider for her young sister and brother. It took long hours of hard work, but Davina was proud of her success in keeping her family together.She had little spare time for social life and none at all for romance. Then she met handsome, charming Nick Tabor, who was quite determined to marry her.It should have been the answer to all her problems. Instead, it seemed only to add to them...'Note to Editor, page 171'She was awakened by the running of water through wedding dress. but the cool sheets were heaven to her tired limbs. Gradually she relaxed and closed her eyes.' ???Nick was the type of man who wanted to control Davina and everything in her life.Davina tried to resist his tyrannical control, but she wasn't strong enough.'"
3,Now that's what I call going undercover !!,"Disguise is taken to the limit in Big Momma's House. Martin Lawrence plays the crafty special agent Malcolm Tuner whose willing to go through thick and thin in order to an escaped federal prisoner. Nia Long plays Sherry, the convicts ex-flame, whose headed for Georgia to lay low for a while. This is just enough to send Malcolm deep undercover as Big Momma, an oversized, over bearing Southern granny with an attittude as tough (if not tougher) than any street gang. The result is an outrageous comedy of epic proportions, filled with non-stop laughs and plenty of action !!!!!"
3,THREE THUMBS DOWN!,"I pretty much like Martin Lawrence's movies, but this one wasn't that funny. There are some scenes where I had my tummy tickled, but, through the whole movie, I was just watching with a serious expression. The grosses part, and I think I speak for everyone that viewed this movie; was the bathroom toilet scene. ..."
3,Not so funny viewed at home,"When I saw this in theatre, it was hilarious. But watching the DVD in the comfort of my home theatre, it wasn't that funny anymore. I guess people laughing around you, make the different. Anyway it is a quite good DVD. The picture and sound quality is good and there are some extra features as well on the DVD (a rarity for Fox considering a standard (PRICE) pricing). If you like it in the theatre, try to rent this first if you still like it that much."
2,Flabby Humor,"Martin Lawrence's take on Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor movies (but without the refined tone and impeccable taste), this one has Lawrence as an undercover FBI agent who impersonates a fat old woman (with diarrhea) in order to nab a bad guy. Most of the humor is gross, toilet-level stuff, presented with lousy timing, but this essentially one-joke, dress-up movie does pack a few laughs. Lawrence does have some funny moves. Still, it's not Tootsie or or even Mrs.Doubtfire."
3,typos and mistakes,If you are anything but a beginner I would not bother with this book. Buy Brynes instead.I found several glaring errors (running English) and several of the illustrations are incorrect. Parallel aiming to name one. Half ball hit is another.
1,Worked once,"Used in Oct at a football game in Chicago worked great, went to another game in Dec. did not work it was a very cold day. When I got home put in garage til spring, when it warmed up did some checking and found the problem was the hose. made contact w/ problem was told it had been to long. Will never buy from again!"
2,Smart people can be pretty dumb.,"I cannot understand why the authors of this book, like so many other ""conservatives,"" feel the need to condemn non-western cultures as a means of celebrating Classical civilization. The authors' disdain for multiculturalism notwithstanding, we DO like in a multicultural world, and that must be part of our educational system. There is no good reason to say that this or that culture was less than adequate just because we prefer (as I do) the Classical world. Also, the authors' position that fifth-century Athens represented some sort of spontaneous generation completely contradicts all the good work of M.L. West and others who have shown the important linkages between Classical Greece and the Near East. I wish someone could present a coherent argument in favor of a traditional approach to education (like Great Books) without coming off sounding like Aristophanes, Allen Bloom, Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Fallwell, and this book's authors."
3,Review of A Brother's Price,"Wen Spencer always creates an interesting read. This one is not her best but is still worthy of being read because it explores the concept of gender reversal i.e. the roles of men and women in society are reversed. The author doesn't explain the reasons for this but implies that is is due to a scarcity of men.The female characters are better developed and more interesting than the male. All of the woman have strong personalities. The main flaw in the book is that Jerin, the male protogonist, is supposed to be a young male approaching marriage age. He vacillates between being a juvenile and an adult male. His relationship with older women comes off as a little creepy and unsettling.The author does get kudos for exploring an unusual plot premise whose twist is a worthwile read but not one that you will want to stay up all night to finish."
4,"Engaging, lightweight fantasy romance","PRICE is a nice reworking of a very old SF trope: what if there were a LOT more women than men? In this case, 15 or 20:1, in a well-drawn mid-19th C. tech-level civilization. Here, large families of (nominal) sisters dominate the PRICE polity. These families hope for male offspring that they can sell (at age 16), then purchase a group-husband for the family. The lead family here is the Whistlers, war-heroes who've parlayed a land-grant to prosperity, and who snatched an orphaned prince for their husband in the last dynastic war...The ensuing hijinx employ a good deal of romance-novel female (and male) wish-fulfillment fantasies, both sexual and non, in a not-terribly-plausible plot that moves briskly to the inevitable happy, passionate ending. Characters are economically sketched, and the action is nonstop. Recommended for light reading, but don't expect the premises to stand up to close inspection. ""B+"", maybe ""A-"".Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
5,what a wonderful book...~!~!,"i live on the cystal coast.. the area that this book takes plan in... i felt as if i knew some of the people in this.book.... to me it was very real.. and it held my attention...i really enjoyed this book , so much that after reading the library copy.. i went out , purchased a copy to have in my own home library..."
2,Not worth the time to read...,"This book is not worth the time to read. The plot is convoluted and unbelievable, the characters are not interesting, and the horses (ponies) are poorly delineated. I gave it every chance, but got so bored with it I started skipping pages madly less than a third of the way into it. Even for confirmed horse-lovers (me, for one), the book rates low. Good grief, horses just do NOT act in the manner described! Who ever heard of a ""wild"" stallion leading a person to a foal's grave and pawing it up? It just doesn't happen that way, folks. Do yourself a favor...pick some other book to read at the beach."
3,Frustrating!,"This is the second Elizabeth Berg novel I've read. I decided to try it after being disappointed by ""Open House"". This book sure did not make up for ""Open House"". I found the same problems with this book. Why does Berg insist on her lead female characters being so stupid? It is very frustrating for me. They appear to be very helpless, no self-esteem and are waiting for the man to save them. What kind of crap is this?! It drives me crazy because parts of the book caused me to say, ""That's just how I feel"", and then turn around and have the character say and do the most stupid things. This is a fast and easy read, and there are some thought-provoking ideas in the book, but I must warn you that you may end up very frustrated!"
2,Tired story with a silly lead character.,"This book didn't do much for me. The plot is old news - single woman with biological clock syndrome and her gay best friend decide to have a baby together. Personally, I couldn't relate to Patty, the primary character. She wants to get married and have a home life, but she can't get over her fixation with her gay former fiance. Sorry, I can't believe that any woman with an ounce of self respect would act this way. The secondary characters offered some promise, but they were never developed enough to carry the story. The mother's issues were the most interesting part of the book. If they had been more fully developed they could have added the emotional tension this story lacked. Despite my complaints about this book, I did like Berg's writing style. The dialogue is witty, and she has a nice ability to set a scene. I will probably try some of her other books because the consensus seems to be that this was below par for her."
1,Glad it was from the Library and not a purchase!,"I got this book from the library on the recommendation of a friend. While the premise of the story was somewhat interesting, the story itself was lacking. In fact, it was so unchallenging and uninteresting that I flipped through it, missing pages at a time, and I finished the book in 15 minutes. As the mother of an active 2 year old, who stays at home, reading is the only thing that stimulates my intellect. Therefore, I can't afford to waste time on a lousy book. Needless to say, I was glad this book only comsumed 15 minutes of my time. If you want a good book, read "" Sister of My Heart"". It is intelligent, well written, and thought provoking. Look it up and enjoy a truly good story."
3,Quick read but disappointing protagonist,"I, too, loved Talk Before Sleep, and I'm enjoying The Pull of the Moon on tape at the moment. Even though Until the Real Thing Comes Along was a good, quick read, it left me feeling flat.I thought of many of my single in their 30s women friends when I read about Patty--those people who really want to have a family but can't find the right guy. I enjoyed some of Patty's characterization (the bit about her fantasy houses, relationship with the older couple), but her obsessive love for Ethan was a bit much. Get over him and move on with your life, Patty!I will keep reading Elizabeth Berg, because I know she's a talented writer, but this one was not one of her best."
2,A big disappointment,"Although Berg's exquisite style never fails, this trite and irritating story doesn't live up to it."
1,A Big Disapointment - A Silly Bit of Fluff,"I have been a great Elizabeth Berg fan for a long time. Her novels have the ability to reduce me to tears with their wisdom, and I look with much eagerness for each new one. But this one was a terrible disappointment. How many times has this story been done already? Dozens. A 36 year old single woman, whose biological clock is running, wise cracks her way through bad dates and life while wasting her time being in love with a gorgeous gay man. The first three pages contained the beautifully wise writing of a Berg novel, but it was downhill from there. This novel made me wonder if Berg wrote it solely for a quick dollar."
3,A little dissapointed...,"I LOVE E. Berg, however, in this novel I thought the story was a little dragged a little and the ending was rushed. it was as if she realized this story needs to end. though Funny at times I just wished all the action didn't happen at the few last chapters."
1,Don't read this book,"Stupid Patty. Thinks in cliches. *Feels* in cliches. So wrapped up in herself and her fixation with babies and Ethan that she can't see what's going on around her, let alone try to make something of her life.I really enjoyed _Joy School_ and _Talk Before Sleep_, and that made this book even more disappointing. Don't waste time reading this book. Don't even borrow it from the library."
4,An enjoyable read,My first Elizabeth Berg novel and I really enjoyed it. I felt that I could really connect with the main characters and thought Bergs developments were great. Its a fun book!
5,This book is excellent!,"I purchased this book for my 2 yr. old grandson. Now his ""grandma book"" is his favorite - we have to read it at least 5 or 6 times every night. It's easy to understand, even for 2 year old, and he can look at his picture and his grandma's picture (which you paste in the cutouts provided) on every page. The book is beautifully illustrated holds child's attention to the very last page. I would highly recommend it for children 18 mos. to 4 years. However, after the age of 4, I think the child would get bored very quickly."
4,an amazing insight,"Although a little bit hard to understand, the literary meaning is appearent. Everyone may receive a different meaning from the book. It is thrilling, yet scary to think that it describes society so well. It reaches into the minds of the violent and it shows the tendencies of their behavior in a whole new light. A must read"
4,Same as the movie,"If you have seen the movie you may as well have read the book. I do not mean to say that it is a bad book by any means, but don't expect anything more. The only thing you get more from the book is the last chapter, which was not included in the movie"
2,A Clockwork Orange,"I can see how people would find this book to be neat. It's defintely unique. I didn't enjoy it, though. I am a reader who likes to get swept onto the page and become the protagonist's shadow, and with this book's inventive language I found that impossible. I could never get into a flow because too often (every paragraph for at least the first seven chapters) I had to stop and figure out what the protagonist was trying to say. I nearly put it down for good when I got about halfway through it. I'm glad I pushed on, though, because the last third of the book--the point in which I had finally figured out enough of the protagonist's language to not have to work so hard--was pretty good.If you like Shakespeare, you'll probably like this book."
4,a unique book,I would like to begin by saying that I chose this book for a high school book report. I am not sure if I would recommend it for other high school students except for juniors and seniors in honors classes. It is difficult to overlook the violence to get to its true meaning. The story was incredibly interesting because it is so different from anything else I've read. Nothing can give you the same disturbing feeling that this story can. I also recommend the movie.
5,"What's it going to be then, eh?","As a future lingustics major, this book fascinated me to no end. I began talking in Nadsat while I read the book, which wasn't a very long time, because it held my attention so raptly that I finished it within a few days. While the language is the main highlight of the book (in my humble opinion), the point of the book is also interesting and important. The concept of the clockwork orange as Burgess explains it snared my mind and made me ""think outside the box"" if only briefly. Keep this one in a glass case, don't let it slip away, read it frequently. & love your droogs, o my brothers."
5,This is the definitive book on modern values,One wonders if our world would be the same if this book had not been written. It challenged a generation to reevaluate their lives. Not since Brian Gilmore from Chicago has such a task been accomplished. Powerful. Stunning. A modern masterwork of thought. A must read!
5,Mindcandy...,"This book grabs a hold of you, as disturbing and charming as it is. An intriguing story filled with emotion, and sometimes the lack of emotions. If you feel like you're ready for some ultraviolence go ahead... Start reading."
3,"A Step in the ""right"" direction","""A Clockwork Orange"" is a good book, maybe even great, but it falls short in a few areas. I guess the most major is language. The dialect of the boys, although entertaining, overshadows the story itself to some point, and is little more than a device to smooth over some of the rougher areas of the literature. Despite that, it was a good, even touching story despite the raw violence that seemed to jump off of every page. Yet despite their raping and beating and killing you manage to feel some compassion for the boys. I won't give away the ending, but in a mark of true fiction, you find the signs of a character who is dynamic both inside an dout in Alex, the leader of the boys. I think it is a good book because it takes a satrical look at the side of society that is too often ignored, although perhaps not so much satrical as just a magnified projection. However, the language (for me) and the violence (for others) prevent me from recommending this book to everyone."
4,One Wild Story,"Don't get me wrong, I loved this book....but I still don't see the point in the Russian. I mean, some people are saying its great, and some are saying its hard to understand...I just find it pointless. Why write a book in two different languages?Other then that, it was really good. The story was really interesting, and I liked it...a lot."
4,A Nightmare or the Future?,"I believe Burgess is a literary genius. This book is a constant page-turner. Burgess thrilled me with his potrayal of the young, thuggish protagonist Alex in the 1960s in England. Alex is a teen who gets his kicks out of extreme violence and destruction. Living his life with blood and women, his many murders eventually catch up with him. After Alex is abandoned by his friends and put in jail, he asks to be the first to try the new experiment. This new experiment Burgess has created is horrifying and at some points unreal. It is a great book for those interested in human pyschology and the struggle between good and evil."
4,my review,"I thought A Clockwork Orange was a great book! All though at times hard to understand, the ""nadsat talk"" was very interesting. It is a book I would recommend to anyone who would like an inside view to the corrupt ways societ works. An interesting event happens in the middle of the book to bring it to a great peak and a terrific ending."
4,The Arabs in History,"After a short chapter entitled ""Arabia before Islam,"" The Arabs in History is essentially a history of Arab Muslims from the time of Muhammad, through the hundreds of years of Islamic imperialism, to the short time of European dominance, to contemporary Islamic nationalism and resurgence.While some will think the Lewis is a neocon who hates Muslims, others will protest that he downplays both the atrocities committed by Muslim rulers, and the humiliation forced on dhimmis down through the centuries (dhimmis were Christians and Jews who were subjugated, humiliated and forced to pay protection money just to save their lives). Either way, the book is a well written and highly informative treatment of a very complex subject by a world-renowned expert in Islamic history."
3,Very brief but informative,"Bernard Lewis here in this book which was written more than a half century ago, rides through the history of arabs very quickly like an express train.The book is excellent for someone who wants to know about who & what are arabs & their history in a brief way, but for those who want more detailed backgrounds, this book wil only serve as an appetizer.Many attack Bernard lewis for inaccuracies, some even were angered by a single line & called for him to check facts albeit the facts were unattainable as it was purely dogmatic belief, undoubtedly some are unjust, how can anyone write about who sits next to God & call it a fact? unless you believe that every word uttered in the old/new testament is asbolute truth & needs no further research to prove but then its called belief not facts.Bernard lewis has his detractors as any serious scholar expects, this book here is not definitive but an interesting read for those blind on the subject."
4,Bill Cosby doing his thing,"Do you like Bill Cosby? If so, then you love this book. Dr. Cosby, comically, rhapsodises about many events from his childhood including his search for Spaqnsih Fly and his run-ins with his brother Russel.The book is easy to read and very light-hearted, much like the doctor himself. For anyone who was ever a child, this book is well worth the time to read."
5,Qualitative Research:in Education:A Usiers Guide,Everything was great. The book arrived in great condition and weel before the maximum delivery date.
5,The Bicycle Thief,I was hooked from the beginning to the end. One of the best films I watched in college. The story is heartwrenching and beautiful. The acting superb because it was so real to the people who played in it. You forget the subtitles are there and soon you even stop reading them.
2,"One of those films that gets incredible reviews, why!?","'The Bicycle Thief' I saw on VHS tape 20 years ago and my reaction was, ""Okay, it that it? Is that all there is to it?""------And I watched it recently on DVD and my reaction is the same.This is a very over rated film. 'Umberto D' by the same Writer and Director is vastly superior IMO, and deserves its terrific reviews. This film, well----- the Guy has a bike, it is stolen, he looks high and low for the Bike, can't find it, decides to steal another, is caught immediately (very unrealisticly done), and, the film ends. Okay, I just don't get the nutty enthusiatic reviews. Prehaps, too many people took film classes in college and your Professor told you this was supposed to be a great film. It is not! The only shot memorable to me is outside of the Soccer Stadium, with the hugh crowd inside, that I will remember. Every thing else is forgettable."
3,Great acting but,"It drives me crazy that in a situation in which your family's survival is at stake, that this father didn't steal a bike within minutes of having his own stolen. I might never get over that."
2,"South of Heaven, West of Hell","This movie was, bar none, the worst movie I have ever seen! I went to the world premiere, and the only reason I was glad I went was that I got to have my picture taken with Dwight Yoakam. I admire Yoakam for writing his own movie, but I think he should stick to singing. The movie was plotless, and the only thing that kept from walking out was Vince Vaughn."
1,Theme To An Imagenary Lousy Western!,"This flick begins with a turn of the Century preacher proclaiming that these ""new moving pictures"" are a sinfull abomination. After viewing the rest of the movie you think he might just be right! ""South of Heaven West of Hell"" has all the bloodshed and exploitation of a Peckinpah western without any of the rhyme, reason or demension. The hard-to-care-about script takes you from one stomach churning monent after another with an understandibly unenthusiastic cast. (Who told Dwight Yokem he could act?) The ONLY people who'll want to waste time with this would be die-hard Pee Wee Herman fans! Pee Wee plays a perverted western badguy... a little TOO convincingly! Other than that no reason to forfeit 2 hours of your life."
2,"Beautifully photographed, that's about it...","I love Dwight Yoakam's music and songwriting, he's surely one of the best singer/ songwriters out there but I think he should leave the screenwriting to professional screenwriters. This film looks beautiful, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired and the dialogue is often very dull. Dwight has some positives in this, as bad as it is. For instance, he looks great on a horse, but he looks uncomfortable in front of the camera here, which is unusual for him, given his other movies. The characters are interesting enough, but not given enough development that we can see. I don't think Dwight should give up directing entirely, but I would not recommend seeing this."
3,Great movie,They don't make movies like this anymore. It is a fun entertaining movie with no hidden agenda. Try finding that at the movies today.
2,Forgettable,"The plot was OK, but the songs were forgettable--almost painful--and the dancing was amateurish. I found myself fast forwarding through a lot. However, the comedic exchanges between Bing and Bob were fun."
5,when foreign stuff gets better,"I was going to buy this but the original UK PAL version, but then I found there was a NTSC release so I went to buy it with no doubt (I bought it here of course).You can find all the original PAL features in here, the only thing that changes is that you get to see the DVD in your TV without first converting it (for NTSC countries) or getting one of those DVD players that can play PAL and NTSC at the same time.DTS 5.1 surround sound is ALL you need to know in order to buy this, PAL or NTSC, whatever, the thing is you get to hear the songs like never before. Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 available too, but not quite as good as this!."
2,Convenient but where's the heat?,"Convenient, compact and looks great on the porch/back of your truck but what about the heat? I'm an Aussie and I like my ""barbies"" hot! Okay for cooking small amounts of meat but if you want to slap on a steak for a quick grilling, a more substantial hot plate would be nice."
5,Yay for Fun!,"I'm 27, but still a kid at heart. My favorite holiday is Halloween, and this movie IS Halloween. The witty lines and clever addition of the universal moral (everyone's different but equal) make this movie a scream (pun intended). My only beef is that I orderedScary Godmother 2: The Revenge of Jimmywith this DVD and only received one. I ordered them at the same time, but they shipped them separate. I asked the company I bought from (-importcds) and they confirmed it shipped, but guessed the post office misplaced it. My money was refunded though. I might try to use them again, but another mishap and I won't be buying from them any more, their fault or not."
1,The Family Juls,Was not impressed by the animation or the content of this movie. In fact I will be giving it away this weekend.
5,maybe better than Sacks,"I got this book at my local public library from a general search I was doing in the catalog. I enjoy books in the vein of neurological anecdotes like those of Oliver Sacks.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and decided early on the I would be sure to write a review to share this find with other readers.I was thrilled by this book. Each of the cases presented is well written and interesting. He tells the story of his acquaintance with a subject or theme, events surrounding the case, what conclusions he considered, what diagnosis he chose; also includes historical information on many neurological diseases covered.The author manages to include a distinctly human touch without straying long from the science. A bonus was the ""author's notes"" at the end of each chapter. These included things like follow-up reading, post mortems, related tales, retrospective comments."
4,36th printing from 1918,This novel with the famous title is a historical adventure fiction from the early 20th century. It is an adventure on a level akin to the Count of Monte Cristo. A good read for the adventure reader looking for new (old) territory to learn about.
1,Dragged on and on,"I finally stopped reading this book. I could not stay awake for more than a couple of pages per night. It dragged on and on and I did not find any of the characters very appealing. I really wanted to read it because I had little knowledge of this period in history, but I will have to find another book, because this one just didn't do it for me."
3,Short chisel awful edge,"This 3/8"" chisel is 1/2"" shorter than the rest of the set. You will spend hours getting this chisel set in usable condition. Otherwise the made in England set seems pretty good. I may return this item however I don't want to break the set. Be aware if you buy these chisels you will need to spend hours preparing them for use."
2,chisel set,the chisel set is decent BUT they sent this chisel as a shorter version than the rest of the set. don't know who to even contact or talk to to get he correct size. i guess this is what happens when you buy a tool from a book company.
5,Between Friends,"It really made me weep... As Neil Young sang: most songs are about love and war. ""Between Friends"" is a piece that can bring some more strength for people life fights. And a hope that everything will change into good..."
4,Longing for Letters!,"This book was such a great read! Even though it has been a while since I read it, I still remember how much I enjoyed the letters and even took up writing a few myself after reading this book."
5,one of the best books i have ever read,"i have read most of this author's work and this book was one of the best books i have read in my life and i am a proud 45 yr old female. i finished this book in two days (and still worked my full time job and was wife and an air force mom). outstanding. loved it. please if in doubt, just read it and see what i am talking about. again, if debbie writes it, i am reading it."
2,"Sounds great, built cheap","OK, I got this item 3 days ago. I absolutely think the sound quality is the best I've heard for a less expensive MP3 option but I've had nothing but problems other than that. It's overheated after only 30 minutes of play, the battery died once after a full charge in only an hour and 15 minutes and the second time in only 50 minutes. I think it's a shame that I'm going to have to use my warranty and return this item because I did spend a decent amount of time setting it up for use. I would not suggest this item to anyone based on my experience"
2,filters DO NOT last 5 years,"I bought two of these units in November 2010. In July 2011 both units began to emit a strong chemical odor. I contacted customer support and was told that I needed to replace the filters. I explained that the cleaners were not even a year old and the representative said it could happen and that the 5 year life for the filters depended on how hard they had to work. I have my house cleaned every 2 weeks and dust is not a problem. I do have a cat (part of the reason for purchasing these) but only 1 cat, not several. I think it is also very suspicious that the filters began to ""fail"" at the very same time. These units are not cheap and neither are the filters. Having to replace the filters, even at a pro-rated discount is too costly. I ended up spending another $250 for 2 new filters after less than a year. Do not be fooled by the 5 year filter claim. It is false advertising as far as I am concerned. I will not be doing business with this company again."
1,black austin air purifier,"I bought the air purifier because someone in my home is ill. The air purifier would assist him to heal, and feel better. When I received the air purifier it was severely damaged. I could not use it. We were very disappointed. Luckily, I had also purchased another one. It arrived in perfect condition. Since we needed it so badly, for weeks we carried the one we have from floor to floor in our house. The item itself, when it is working, is excellent. I would recommend it, as the best air purifier on the market. I recently purchased another air purifier, so now we have one on each floor. We are breathing much better!"
2,Motor burned out in 10 days,"As the title said, the motor burned out in 10 days. After following the recommended procedure for running it the first time, I kept it running at its lowest setting for most of the 10 days. Day 10, I came home and I could immediately smell something burned out. Checked the unit and it was barely blowing anything and hot on top. Glad I wasn't away from it any longer.When it was working it seemed to do well enough. It was quiet on it's lowest setting. Any higher and it is far too loud to tolerate. I might buy again with the hope that I just got a bad one."
1,Don't look at the inside cover of the 3rd Edition,"My first impression of this book was not good. Open the cover and see a quick index. It's all wrong. According to the publisher, ""perhaps that's something that didn't get updated from the second edition."" I was informed that I could either ignore the pages with the incorrect information, take a marker and mark through all of the incorrect information, or ship the book back to them (at my expense) for a refund. Since I have not looked at any more of the book, I cannot say anything good or bad about any more of the contents. From my first impression of the book and the customer service, I can say that I will probably be returning it and buying another from a different publisher."
1,book,"Not at all what I expected. I was looking more for an ""emergency"" type book, which this is not. Way too complex and academic. I send it back."
4,Almost as pulpy as the paper it's printed on,"Alan had a chance to confess to the crime he committed as a teen. Instead, he ducked suspicion and let it fest for fifteen years. What plays out, through the words of his cousin, true crime writer Colin, is how the perfect crime and perfect life of Alan went terrifically, horrifyingly wrong.I enjoyed the style, as it's different from the novels of this genre I've read in the past. Every time I find a book from Hard Case while I'm out and about, I pick it up. I've not been disappointed yet."
5,The Star Wars Spirit,"This TOY is great to collectors for two reasons: 1) this figure captures the spirit of star wars, a young Jedi fight angainst 10 or 15 special troopers, to protect a senator and himself, you see his face in the movie? relax, on peace, making his job.And the other reason is simple: George Lucas son !!!"
2,more bush jokes??? give me a brake.....,1----4 years after the bush administartion and still no barack hussein humor only the same ol bush is bad crap..... ??same goes to 30 rock and snl......boring........2-----total office rip off just political in a bad way.
4,Parks and Rec,Fun characters and funny story lines. A series that keeps getting better and better each season. Everyone should give it a chance.
5,Like American Dad humor but real people,"This is the first season I watched Parks and Rec and it made me buy the other seasons and get interested. At first it seems very random and stupid. It's very much like the cartoon show American Dad in humor, but real people acting like morons. But in the end you get used to it and it all works. You'll be laughing ALOT!"
2,Unimaginative and often poor recipes,"I've made at least fifty of the recipes in Carpender's book, from main courses to desserts. All of them were very mediocre, and some were downright bad. I don't know if there were typos as far as the amount of ingredients goes, or if Carpender's taste buds have been ruined by eight years of low-carbing. Many concoctions simply needed to be thrown away, and I'm not a novice cook. I'm a very good cook, and perhaps that is the problem: I expect my food to taste good, and I'm willing to spend the time and effort to do it. Many of the recipes consisted of two ingredients, such as a meat and salt. That's not a recipe, that's a serving suggestion. If you want low-carb with flavor, I suggest one of George Stella's books, or even Donna Pliner Rodnitzky's books. These people are obviously good cooks and have many wonderful recipes to share."
5,"What a delightful, useful, and witty book!","When one opts for a low-carb lifestyle, it's easy to go into the kitchen lost as to what to prepare. This book is wonderful...it changed the way I looked at cooking. Every recipe I've tried has been great and even better than that, my boyfriend (who isn't on a low-carb diet and is a picky eater) is enjoying the recipes as well!The recipes are practical. Some of the baked goods involve ingredients that can be tricky to find...but for the most part, one can make any of these dishes with foods they have around the house. I cannot praise this book enough. It is by far the best and most useful low-carb I've found."
2,Disappointing,"I enthusastically bought this book after reading the other reviews and I was very disappointed. Unlike most cookbooks, there isn't a single picture in this one, and it is printed on cheap paper. Many of the recipes call for expensive, speciality store ingredients. Perhaps if you make them again and again it becomes economical, but it turns out to be very expensive if you make it once and don't like it. I have used several of the recipes, but haven't found one that I would make a second time."
3,Good Ideas,There were some pretty good recipe ideas in this book but many of them used ingredients I don't keep around my house.
4,Worth Buying,"Following a low carb diet often results in eating the same foods over and over again. This book has many recipes that I've tried and really enjoyed. Honestly, though, some recipes are pretty involved and call for ingredients that are not always readily available.Overall, it's a good recipe book and has some desserts to die for. Mmmmm. I just adore the pumpkin cheesecake."
3,Artificial Sweeteners,"Although there are some good recipes in this book, a lot of them contain artifical sweeteners, not something I use. I was disappointed and should have checked into it more."
4,Lots of great recipes,"Glad I bought this recipe book before Thanksgiving. I made the pumpkin cheesecake and EVERYONE loved it. I must have spent a couple of hours putting little ""stickies"" on all the pages for the recipes I plan to make. I was an avid low fat/ high carb chef, so finding a book with all these great recipes will help insure that I continue finding success with my low carb food program.I also recommend buying Dana Carpender's book about her journey in losing 40 lbs and keeping it off. It's a great inspiration for helping me persist in my quest to get healthy and lose weight."
2,Missing Information,"I was hoping this book could help with my preferred eating plan -- 1250 calories in a 40/30/30 mix of carbs, protein and fat. But since the author doesn't include any nutritional information other than carbs and fiber, I returned it."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,i thought that it was low carb that it would be low fat.. maybe low carb but not low fat :(
3,good for those with limited cooking experience,"While the book touts 500 recipes, many of them are incredibly basic. I feel like anyone that has spent time in a kitchen would have the capacity to throw a particular ingredient in a pan and saute it with some salt and butter. Unfortunately, basic recipes are the book's mainstay. This doesn't mean it is a complete failure. I know lots of people that would need a basic primer such as this to initiate any type of cooking activity and basic recipes provide the basis for more complex ones. Another problem I had with the book is that I eat food first with my eyes and I tend to make recipes first that are accompanied by pictures; this book had no photos to demonstrate that a low-carb recipe can look just as appetizing as a high-carb one. For individuals attempting to transition to low-carb diet, I think delicious and visually appealing foods are important."
3,Simple Paperback Cookbook...hit or miss for us,"Substantial index of recipes for a Low-Carb Diet. However, ""The Whole Family Will Love"" them, was not the case for our family...but perhaps it will be for yours. Our impressions were that the recipes ranged from overly simple, to simply not satisfying. No real complaints though, a good outing from the author, just perhaps not as well received as we had hoped. The book was ""ok"". Happy to share with friends of similar interest but we would not buy it again."
1,ok so wheres the beef?,I just got this book and its nice and big and has lots of content but some of the offerings are for the complete idiot. I didn't need a book to tell me how to fry up a few onions and mushrooms in butter and serve over the steak. To be fair there are some interesting things in this book and some I will try but it was not worth the money. I counted on all the good reviews i read here and folks you let me down this time. I did however get the other book I ordered and am happy to say that laurie's low carb receipes promises to be the best book i have ever gotten and all of the carb counts are truely low unlike this book which has counts as high as 13 or more. I am resistant and i must stay right around 15 to 20 per day to lose and keep it off. Dana's book limits what I can use for any one meal. If i had had a chance to leaf through this book first I would not have bought it and now that i have it I shall wrap it and give it as a gift.
2,Don't even try!!!,Tried several recipes from this book...they were quite basic but turned out ok.The worst thing is the breads...the recipes are totally off...the bread are simply aweful...so very very bad that they were not edible. A complete waste of time and money...and I do mean money... the ingredients are so expensive.
5,Great Low-Carb Book,This recipe book has plenty of variety. You can make a different chicken dish every day of the week and not get bored. A lot of different spices are used to make even low carb food interesting.
1,Buyer Beware,"In time this fixture's finish (coating) from being exposed to sun, rain and etc., will turn chalky. The Dorian Bronze finish will deteriorate to the point of exposing the base metal and they will then corrode. This fact has been pointed out to the manufacturer.Here is Minka's response:Your Minka outdoor fixtures are warranted for a period of 1 year from the date of purchase. The finish on outdoor product is specifically excluded from warranty coverage due to harsh environmental conditions beyond our control.If I could give zero stars to this product I would. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy!"
5,Great Dracula Portrayal,"This is one of the best portrayals of Dracula that is out there. If you enjoy this story, you will like this movie. I have always liked this version."
2,poor quality transfer,I loved this version of Dracula however the DVD video quality is terrible. Many scenes are very dark. Scenes are so dark that skin tones are nearly dark orange. I would love to have this movie in Blue-Ray!
3,"Great idea, but the game is just ok.","I purchased this game for my 5 year old. The idea of the game is to stare at a tiny card with tons of details. Then you are asked to remember some obscure detail about the picture. It is even hard to answer some of the questions when you are looking at the pictures. If you are looking for an educational game, look somewhere else. Your child might learn to pay more attention to details, but I can't think of any other educational value. I don't see what is so stimulating about Superman comic pictures (22 in all), and I like Norman Rockwell but 30 pictures seems over kill."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"The batteries were not the same as what they said they were, and the polarity of the batteries was reversed. Because of this I ended up damaging them while charging, which is something anyone else would end up doing with this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,an ok product,"I honestly expected something a little bigger. The flower does look pretty but it is hard to see since it not big, Also, the thickess of the ring is not exactly what I expected"
5,A View from Mount Parnassus,"James Collins wrote this work in 1984 and has continued to add to the scholarship of the subject based on his years of study, instruction and travels throughout Italy and renders a very informative insight to Dante's Divine Comedy. His commentary on the Cantos are lucid and insightful and as one of his former students, I can attest that his work will leave you with a favorable impression and perhaps a desire to further scholarship. James Collins has also authored these other Dante works: ""Dante: Layman, Prophet, Mystic"", ""Praying with Dante"", and ""Meditations with Dante Alighieri""."
3,united we stand,"This is rather Ok album by darkthrone. Nothing over-the-top extreme/evil here, just a few more old black metal tunes. The intro was very interesting but the rest just did not stand up to early Darkthrone reputation and fell flat with simple riffing and dominant slow tempos. Well, not to say that it's bad, it's not but it doesn't get adrenaline pumping either. However, it's black metal, not some nerdy electronic/techno bs. Thank god."
2,Not good at all,"BM fans have always been accused of bad taste. It always seemed that BM albums required a minimal level of bad production and out-of-key-instruments in order to be considered as good.This isn't the case here. Production is much better than most Darkthrone's albums, and music itself is catching and very in tune.So, What's wrong with this record?Well...It's PUNK for crying out loud!As a BM fan myself I'm dissapointed to read the reviews below. ""Black metal album of the year"" one says, ""Dark and evil"" adds another. Guys? Are you OK? Have you actually listened to ""Det Soarter No"" or ""Striving for a Piece of Lucifer""? No fellas, What I hear is Punk. Bad Punk. Blink 182 drums, Combined with Sex Pistols riffs, Performed by aging men that lost any musical talent. Crap.People, Darkthrone WERE a great group up to ""Transilvanian Hunger"". But after that, like most bands, they just ran out of ideas. Do yourselves a favor and save your 15$ for something better than this."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Waste of time. Take The Rowan, and how ordinary that was, with all the young reader girlish elements, and others silliness, and make it worse.Have mother and father from that spit out a kid who exacerbates the problems found in that other novel.Definitely don't waste your time with this one unless some sort of hardcore McCaffrey nut."
4,"""a most compelling and intriging look at the 24th century""",I find that Damia is a sexy look at a talented young prime with a more vivacious way to look at life. I enjoyed the book very much and give it an 8 out of 10. Thanks!!!!!
5,Damia is a must-read for McCaffrey's many fans.,"Anne McCaffrey travels back into the world of Talented individuals, begun in ""To Ride Pegasus"". ""The Rowan"" marked the beginning of a series of books about one extremely talented family. ""Damia"", the second book, looks at one of the Rowan's children, the beautiful and powerful Damia. Damia falls into many misadventures, as any normal kid who could do stuff with her mind would, but matures into a brilliant young lady.""Damia"" has everything a good Anne McCaffrey book has--suspense, drama, a beautiful heroine, and love. I highly recommmend this book to any Anne McCaffrey fan."
4,Pictorial Anatomy of the Cat,The book is exactly what I needed and really helps with the class. Great detail.
4,Great help for the vet student,My daughter is studying to be a vet and I sent her this book. She said it is helpful in identifying many systems of the cat. She has used it for labs and papers.Good pictures and a good price here.Not super advanced for later years students but good at the beginning.
3,Good Purchase,"Just as with any cast iron item, it mus be seasoned well in order to cook on it without things sticking. It fits perfectly on the grill top."
1,Just another fruitcake,"This book was terrible. I am not going to waste my time with details here. If you believe that 9/11 was orchestrated by the US Government, if you regularly visit Area 51 with telescope in hand, and you believe that there are silent black helicopters flying around in your neighborhood than this book is for you.Just another guy who claims to have some exclusive truth that the establishmet has been conspiring to hide from us for 2,000 years. In other words Heaven is sparsely populated because 99.9% of the people from Christ until now never had the truth and are now in hell.This along with the total lack of scholarship makes this book less than a 1 star."
3,What's fun for 2 is not fun for many,"I played this game one on one with another person and we had a fairly good time. Even though we could not answer over half the questions, they were multiple choice and we learned a lot. But once we took the game to a party with about 6 players, the game lost its luster. Not only did we all not know the answers to most of the questions, we weren't guessing correctly either. Couple that with the fact it seemed forever before it was your turn again, the game was a flop.Maybe if we played in teams it would have been better, but it just didn't work out for a group."
5,The ultimate successor to Trivial Pursuit,"The lovely thing about this game is that it's just as much fun played w/ two people as it is w/ six! I highly reccommend this game because, unlike Trivial Pursuit, it does NOT take an eternity to finish. The rules are simple and the topics infinite. It is a guaranteed delight! I learned a LOT of new things thanks to this game. Buy it NOW!"
1,"for loads of FUN, DO NOT get this game","After spending about an hour playing this game, I was disappointed with it. The game was dry, boring, and simplistic- it was like sitting through a SAT review class, except the creators tried to make this fun. My advice would be not to buy this game, though if you want to learn about analogies, this may be the game for you. I'd recommend that you go and buy an SAT review book, draw a few squares on a board, and then subsequently play your own game. The Analogies don't make sense, the questions are all European history, and the other questions are plain... The questions aren't even hard; they are worded badly and try to stimulate the mind- it fails in all respects. I recommend this game to anyone who has nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon, and can not find another game to play."
2,Not Fun,"Our family enjoys games, particularly puzzles and thinking games, so we were excited to try this one which has an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, it was too long, boring, frustrating and not fun. We had a set of 5 including teens who are all gifted, a PHD, and a MD; we consider ourselves good at games. Maybe we are not as smart as we think because we each answered only 2-10 questions correctly in the entire 2 hours of play. And, I don't mind being wrong if I am learning something or entertained by the witty questions, or pleasantly stunned by another player's knowledge of some minutiae, but I could not care less about many of the questions: which of the following was NOT an early 18th century writer? (the right answer was the one writer who was LATE 18th century--gotcha there!) Or how about knowing famous authors' first names? Boring! Inane! We couldn't encourage anyone to take the game home with them; we give it a failing grade."
3,An interesting debut that promises much more.,"This is an excellent debut for a band that plays the pub and bar circuit in southeast England. Completely self financed and produced, it contains some superb pieces and masterful musicianship. From the opening seagull motif through an elaborate tapestry of a musical voyage it never fails to deliver a level of maturity and emotion.The album though has a major defect which only allows it to have 3 out of 5. The production quality is quite poor. This can be accounted for because it was a self financed CD, but it does diminsh what could have been one of the finest debut albums of the British underground progressive rock scene."
4,"Get it, you wont regret it......","Great movie from long ago, Some funny scenes, great story line you will want to watch this one to the end,then maybe again, My favorite scene that puts a lump in my throat is the deer scene."
5,"Yes, there is such a thing called ""love""","There are also gentleness, sweetness, innocence, forgiveness, grief, sadness, joy ... put all that together and you get one of the best movies ever (not only in science fiction) Jeff Bridges performed here the best role of his career. and John Carpenter created a true classic, highly recommended, I love it!"
1,A Bothered Fan of The Film.,"Carpenter is a director with great highs and lows in his career. Who has managed to make special editions for just about everyone one of his movies except this one. Recently I just read Christine (The killer car Movie!) is getting special edition treatment as opposed to this great family film. Long time Jeff Bridges fan I realized that he gives an oscar nominated performance here, so I wonder whats the deal. Why no Starman Special Edition or even Superbit it. this film deserves better treatment."
3,"Not Bad, Certainly Not Great Either","I expected a bit more from this movie based on its reviews. Obviously, each review is subjective, but I can't see much over three stars here. Bridges is good, yes, and there is some chemistry between him and Allen, but the plot is held together by band aids. Obviously, for a movie like this one must be able to suspend belief to enjoy, but this one asks a little too much. People help the protagonists out for no obvious reason, and there simply isn't enough connection made between the two main characters throughout to make the deep affection they feel for each other at the end believable."
2,OK for Practice,"Not a great source of GRE strategy and study, but has very decent practice exams. CD-ROM is a nice addition and great practice tool."
2,Less than satisfactory,"While I was very pleased with the overall design of the phones, the implementation just didn't impress me enough. A few of the ""soft"" buttons on the handsets didn't work properly, which made programming the phones or working with their advanced features very difficult. More importantly, there seemed to be a high signal to noise ratio while actually using the phone, even after moving the base station to different locations. I guess 2.4GHz is just too crowded, at least in my apartment. I ended up returning the product after 3 days."
2,Looks Better Than it Operates,"The two phones are handy, and the wired base station is great to have as backup during power outage. However the speakerphone volume is too low and the recording quality poor. Also, there was distortion while speaking on the wired handset that was bothersome. Lastly, my family complained of ""echo"" and inconsistent volume while speaking on the instrument, wired or wireless."
1,At least it's consistent,We have had the same problems other reviewers reported. The caller ID stopped working first after about 6 months. We were unplugging to reset it several times a day. Then even answering the phone became hit and miss. The one good thing is that the manufacturer replaced it with no hassle. So far it has been another 8 months and the caller ID has only gone out 3-4 times in the past couple months. But the volume is not good (I'm constantly asking callers to repeat themselves) and it clicks all the time which is very annoying. We have just replaced it with a phone that got great reviews. I am hoping it works much better than this one.
2,You can do better! Buy the Glencairn glass instead.,"I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend these glasses. The overall form is attractive and the Riedel name carries some weight, but look closely at the base of the glass--see how pinched and tight it is down there? Riedel overlooked one thing . . . these glasses do not fit the human hand! I don't know what they were thinking. Not a satisfactory way to enjoy your dram. Before you order, check out the Glencairn whisky glass--a much better (and lower cost) design adopted by most of the distilleries in Scotland and by all the major whisky events here in the states. Thanks for listening. Cheers!"
4,great anime kids show kind off,This anime is for young teenagers. The character development starts off slow but you'll catch up. This show has people playing with animated dolls its part of the game watch it and see.
5,Uniquely Insightful & Funny,"Ralphie is that rare comic who is funny, insightful, and constantly evolving. He uses consistantly fresh and hilarious material to cut through so much B.S. or racism we don't notice or just take for granted. Sometime he'll just rant on an absurdist topic. Either way he brings you along as he breaks down the rediculousness of a current event or a generally accepted concept.If you have a chance to see Ralphie live he's even better because he engages each audience differently, like it's a conversation. You won't hear any worn topics, or regurgitated punch lines. I'd highly recommend his dvds and live shows."
4,Ralphie rocks!!,"Ralphie May is definitely a shining star on the comedy scene and if you're a true Ralphie fan, this video won't disappoint you. The only thing that prevented me from giving the video 5 stars was that I've seen him live, and that was by far his finest performance. This video isn't quite as funny, but it's still worth the price of admission."
4,"Combs work fine, need a holder/organizer","These combs work well with our Andis clipper, they make it much easier for us non-professionals to achieve the desired length of cut for our dog's fur. Nice to have an assortment of different lengths to choose from. The issue here is that once you take these out of the package, you have nine combs laying around, no way to keep them organized by size or store them all together. I would have gladly paid a buck or two more if it came with some sort of case or organizer that would store the combs in order by size. When you have your dog up on the grooming table, the last thing you want to be doing is trying to figure out which size comb is which. But the combs themselves work fine, easy to take on and off the clipper."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,This product was a disappointment to me. I have a small dog and I experienced the clipper getting very hot before I was finished. I also felt that I had to make far too many passes to get her fur clipped. I had hoped for much more.
5,Nice selection of attachments,Lots of attachment lengths to choose from. Easy to get on the clippers if you hook over the clipper blade first and then push onto the back end of the clipper head.
1,quality of DVD is terrible,When you attempt to play this on a DVD player the picture is fuzzy and goes out of focus. It can be played more successfully on a computer but this is not what I ordered or thought I was paying for.
2,CAN YOU SAY CHEESE?!?,"SPOILER WARNING: This movie was pretty good until the end. The ending was SOOOO cheeeeeesy that I laughed sooo hard and puked blood for three days after watching (j/k, no blood). Come on, a guy left his freaking hot wife for 7 years, came back, and gives his wife away at the drop of a dime!?! PLEASE, how did this get passed script review?...if I were in charge, there would be a bloody battle between the dead beat dad and the hero of the movie. I puked less blood when I watched Salma Khan fights a whole village by himself. Hindi movies are so cheesy because they try too hard to put in predictable and cheesy twists and turns that ruined the movies. You will be disappointed! Watch Kuch Kuch Hota Hai if you hate cheesey movies."
5,Perfect!,"I have no words to describe kurosawa's movies they are just perfect, and Derzu Uzala is surely one of his best movies. The scene when they are building the hut is incredible. The characters are so well constructed and the acting is so good, that they really get into you. The character Derzu is one that will never leave me, one of the most curious characters I have ever seen."
1,Dersu Usala,"Greatly disappointed-not translated into English-as well as no subtitles. Have viewed this movie before, and know that it is available in a translated format."
4,Not Kurosawa's best but still worthy,"You can sense Akira Kurosawa was not at his best during the filming of this movie, eventhough it is still a beautiful story that is well told. Acting was ok though it lacks the ""connecting"" intensity in the relationship between these two men who are supposed to be kindred spirits despite being from two very different worlds."
1,"Great film, terrible quality video!","I purchased this video for my husband (one of his all-time favorite movies) and it was a terrible disappointment due to the exceedingly poor quality of the video itself. We were unable to watch it. It did not play well - squares of pixels were constantly cropping up and obscuring the picture almost to oblivion. Also, at times, the subtitles disappeared, and at others, there was no sound. We ended up turning it off halfway through. I will never again purchase an item from this company."
5,No school like the old school...,"To those who are new to the universe of Gundam, or to those who are only familiar with SEED and Wing, this is definitely something to get. These thee movies were originally released around 1980, due to the success of the TV series, and they show just how outstanding the world of Gundam truly is. Sure, the animation is outdated, and there is no english dubbing, (whether that's good or bad is up to you) but these movies show Amuro's four months of combat through the later half of the One Year War. Many elements from the original series are missing, like many of the wierd Mobile Armors, no final duel between the Gundam and the Gyan, and the final scenes of movie 3 are missing some music. Overall, this set is not to be overlooked."
5,Great prep for new sibling,This book is great for helping expectant parents prepare a young child for a new sibling. I frequently use it as a gift when friends are expecting.
1,the vendor does not have stock,"This vendor--famous deal-- Amazon continues to show this item with this vendor, but they have no stock. I found out 2 weeks later. Very disappointing."
4,Perfect fit.,"The grill cart fits the Q220 perfectly. There is no wobble and its very sturdy. Scary part is...I built it. I hope I pounded the axel on enough so the wheels stay on. I do love the cart. Also, the grill can just be lifted off if I want to take it somewhere. And since it came with the adapter hose it saved me a few bucks there."
4,Bottom grid is a little wobblie,"As mentioned in other reviews the cart is made of composite materials. It is sturdy enough for my patio setting. However, the bottom grate upon which the tank rests flexes quite a bit. I don't know if this has any long term implications for the life of the cart but I don't like to see the wobble.I looked at the Weber tubular cart before buying this item. It is billed as the way to go if you want to move the grill to a beach or other outdoor site. I would not recommend buying the tubular cart and just pick up the grill from the stationary cart and carry it to your picnic site. My grill is aluminum and very lightweight.Also, I love the combination of the Q200 and Stationary Cart. I have owned grills (charcoal & gas) for over 30 years and overall this combination works the best."
5,The Northern Ghan DVD,"This production was far better than anticipated.It nicely covered the train journey between Darwin and Alice Springs.It is a recent production and nicely covers the popular attractions along or near the route.If I ever return to Australia, I would consider taking the train along the route."
4,"The dog who came to stay, heartwarming","It was interesting to read a book about a pet from the male perspective--very enlightening, educational, and interesting. I liked this book in general but loved the escapades that Pat had, how they ended up, and their effect on everyone. I enjoyed learning about the other animals and their habits. I loved that Hal knew exactly what his dog wanted, his routines and likes and dislikes. I love how he realized his moods, thoughts, reasons why he did what he did and his total understanding of this dog. Having a dog, I totally understand how they ""talk"" to us! I could envision the fields, ponds, countryside and area that they wandered and spent their time--it was quite relaxing to read. I expected the ending to be very sad and was quite pleased that it was not."
2,Will leave lasting images in children's minds,"My parents showed this to me when I was 7 and they were expecting my younger brother. I'm now 30 and 23 years later, I still have the vivid memories of a bed bouncing up and down and swimming sperm with top hats racing to meet an egg dressed up as a bride. If you don't mind your kids having such images left permanently in their minds and leaving them only more confused about the birds and the bees process, then by all means, show them the film!"
4,"Good, but maybe too graphic...","I got the movie and book as a ""pack"" after our 5 year old asked about sex and babies. Yes SEX and babies....horrifying thought isn't it.I enjoyed how it explained what really happens to make a baby. How it takes a man and a woman, sperm and eggs etc. And I liked how they used ""LOVE"" in a lot of it. It was all about the man and the woman loving each other. :)What I could have done with out was the detail about sex.To me they just went a little to far...I would have left it at the man and woman are naked and very close to each other...end of story.The movie however goes into detail about the man putting his penis into the woman's vagina and wiggling around. Then explains how it has the same feeling as being tickled. Its one thing to know that ""sex"" is the reason babies are made, but not a manual for how it's done.So overall I give this 4 stars, but I would have cut out the one part. Luckily in the book you can skip over it (until they learn to read anyway)"
3,The Golden Age of Pin-Up Girls from Behind the Camera,"Bunny Yeager was a one-time ""Playboy"" model who ended up making more of a contribution behind the camera during the Golden Age of Pin-Up Girls. Yes, that is Bunny with the famous Betty Page, Queen of the Pin-Ups, on the cover (Bunny is on the left, Betty on the right, for those of you who got lost somewhere between Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe). This DVD is basically an interactive pictorial put together by Yeager, who offers commentary accompanying photographs and short films of the girls she photographed during the 1950's and 1960's. Of course most of the photographs are in black and white, but there are color shots as well. If you are a collector of Betty Page photographs, or those of her less successful counterparts, you will find this of passing interest. Equal parts insight and titillation."
2,Not really that funny or entertaining...,"I really expected this to be gutbustingly funny, but it's not. Given that ""travel lessons learned too late,"" is included in the title, it is reasonable to assume that this is just misadventures, and it certainly is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something humourous, I just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. This is partly due to the fact that she seems to get herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt."
1,Ugly American,"I'm a great fan of this sort of book but this one surprized me. Ms Halliday takes us on quite a journey throughout the world and focuses almost exclusively on her own discomforts--how poor she is, how high she is, how dirty she is, how sick she is, how unlucky she is to have male companions less game for ""authentic"" experiences than herself, then there is her bowel...I realized that I was reading a book by the proverbial ugly American. As such it is a chastening tale to us all, and worth the read."
4,A must for every fan of JLC!,"As an admirer of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, I've read much on his life - but most books deal precious little with the rest of his family. This book fills that gap. Although I felt that his relationship with Fanny & their children was slighted just a bit, that has been covered in other sources. I found Ms Loski's look at the other Chamberlain siblings - particularly Sae, who is mentioned so little in other works, & the hapless Thomas - to be enlightening, fleshing out my picture of JLC by placing him in the framework of the people he best knew & loved. I've recommended this book to several people already. Thank you, Ms. Loski!"
3,Good low budget indie flick,"This movie is about a boutique owner named Holly who is trying desperately the boutique she has owned for ten years open. She has one weekend to make a huge amount of money and puts on a huge mother's day sale as an attempt to do this.You can tell right away this movie is low budget, but that adds to its charm. It is filmed in away that it seems like we are there with the characters. Most the the actors and actresses and the setting seems like just another boutique in LA, one that I have gone into a thousand times, and actors and actresses look like the normal people I see around this town. None of them are well known, which adds more of a realness to the production. The story is good, a little choppy, leaving a little to be desired, but good.The thing that kind of irked me about this movie was the camera work, the camera is very shakey and tends to spin around, making me feel seasick. This was only a couple times in the movie, but I could have done with out it."
4,Could use a little more plush,"Before Lydia came alone, my husband and I were (dare I say) Barney Haters. We could not fanthom the fascination with this big goofy dinasaur.Now my 2 year old watches the show, and I don't know what I'd do w/o him. She *adores* Barney. She sings along, dances, and learns things.To the point:I bought this toy because it played the song ""I Love You"" and Lydia really likes singing along with that.Pros:1. She loves Barney2. Plays the song she likes and recognizes most.Cons:1. It only plays one chorus of the first part of the song for every push.2. Button should be where the heart is instead of under it. She's managed to push it on her own a few times, but it's mostly me pushing it.3. Could stand to be a little more plush and probably about 4 inches bigger for better squishy-hugability.Even with all the cons however, I don't regret this purchase. It needs work, but Lydia still likes it, just not as much as she *could* like it."
4,"Engaging, engrossing read (but pass the antibiotic wipes)","I'm not a usual reader of crime fiction, but this book is an entertaining, quick read, and should appeal to folks beyond any artifical designation of ""genre"".The characterization is unique, sometimes sparse without superfluous detail, but always catches your attention. Many side characters have enough ""color"" to them that they stick in your head.The action moves along briskly. Occasionally I would like a little more detail in settings, but it all works.The thing I appreciate the most is that the author doesn't make all of the conclusions for you. You have room for interpretation at the end. But don't worry, it's not a philosopical tome, but an enjoyable read."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this pan primarily for broiling and have used it for over six months. Initially quality seemed good, but I quickly discovered that this pan easily stains. After broiling I sometimes have to scrub very hard to clean the pan - even after soaking the pan for two days."
1,Big Trick II,I bought this dvd thinking it was a made for TV movie staring Mary Stuart Anderson. It was not. Too bad AOL can't provide more information on the products they are selling.
5,You Must See Guns and Weed,"For anyone who believes in Liberty, Property Rights, and Self Defense, you need to see this movie. If you care about one or the other, this movie will make you see how these two issues are in fact the same issue. That all people should be able to own any property they want, as long as it is obtained in a peaceful, non-aggressive manner. The drug war is a failure and has hurt more people than the drugs themselves ever would. Gun control only disarms and transforms us into victims, needlessly dependent on a state that only cares about its own interests. These guys also do a weekly podcast, Freedom Feens, and I eagerly await it every week. Check this movie out, I truly believe that it could not only change your outlook on Guns and Weed, but your outlook on almost every aspect of your life."
2,lame hero,"This was perhaps the GAY-est hero ever written. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He's written as a Beau Brummell-esque character, a leading arbiter of fashion but in light of all the ""intrigue"" and ""suspense"" the author has him dealing with, comes off as slightly ludicrous instead of hot. I mean at one point he actually shivers in dread. That's right: shivers. The actual consummation, when it finally happens, is just gross and seems completely out of character."
3,Helmet smaller than advertised ...,"The description on this helmet says it is for 8 - 14 years. However, upon arrival, it is a 5+ years helmet and really too small for my 9 year old son. The inside of the helmet has velcro and it comes with two sets of foam inserts you can use to adjust the size. One set is thick to make the helmet smaller to fit a younger child and one thinner set to fit an older child. Either set of inserts makes this helmet too tight for my average size 9 year old. Nonetheless, he likes the helmet and refused to return it. He is able to wear it without either set of inserts, but sometimes complains that the velcro hurts his head."
5,"Great, protection and quality","We bought this helmet, in pink,for our 8 yr old Grandaughter and she loved it. It is very ""girly"" looking and the quality of construction and protection is great. She say's it is comfortable, but a little tight (so it may be a litlle small, but it works for now. I would definetly recommend this helmet, especially for the price."
1,This book was very poorly written and boring.,"""Ben Franklin of Old Philadelphia"" was a very poorly written and boring book. I think this book was very boring because it was indescriptive and had very little action. This is a biography of Benjamin Franklin. I am not trying to imply that Benjamin Franklin lived a boring life. It is just that this book does not describe Benjamin Franklin's life very well. I highly recommend you DO NOT read this horrible book, and if you are one of those stubborn people who must read this very undetailed book anyway, I suggest that you read a couple pages, then skip ten times as many pages as you just read"
2,Sink Daisy,"I needed a sink strainer and bought this because it was scented. It works okay as a strainer, though because it's a rubbery plastic, it gets slimey. I have a pretty good sniffer and the apple cinnamon scent is negligible. I don't recommend this product and won't buy it again."
5,TOP NOTCH READING,"I know Allen Long and think that he must be one of the most adventurous men I've ever met. This book is his tale of his younger years, running the gambit on the Mary Jane trail; taking the risks and living the life that goes with it. What makes this book so awesome, is that Allen actually did live this book! This isn't a story to be told to wow anyone; Allen is a wealthy man today and doesn't need to impress anyone. This is just a good book about something that we all would have probably loved to try back in our younger years if we just had the balls...Allen has those balls you wished you had. A must read if you want to re-live some fantasy's and live vicariously through Allen Long!"
3,good material but kind of a bore,"Being pretty familiar with the topic, I found this a good read but it isn't very well written and I really had to slug through it to get what I wanted out of."
5,Jumanji,A classic CVA story...love the DVD included with the newest editionRead it your will love it as much as my students.
1,Beware 83 min. VHS version with the yellow cover art!,"Black Sunday is a classic film that, as a film, rates at least four and a half stars. Unfortunately, one of the VHS versions being offered, the 83 min. version with the yellow cover art, is *neither* the new Image restoration, nor is it AIP's generally well-regarded version with the Les Baxter score.This 83 min. version (click on tech. details to see running time) with the yellow cover art is actually a *very* poor quality transfer from a very soft, scratchy, and splicy print, put out by a company called Video Entertainment Corp. It's essentially a censored, poor quality version of the Italian version--the worst of both worlds.If you're going to get Black Sunday on VHS, by all means opt for the widescreen VHS put out by Image, which has *red* cover art, and an 87 min. running time (again, click on tech. details to confirm that the version you are getting is the 87 min. version from Image)."
2,"Great Movie, Lousy Video","I was 11 when I first saw Black Sunday. It was very scarey and I thought about it nightly for months. I think Barbera Steele was my first love.I enjoyed the movie very much - as a reminder of times past. However, the video was terrible. The sound was slightly better than terrible. I'd have paid more for a better quality video. I wonder if the expensive DVD has the same issues as the VCR tape?"
1,it will not hang up,"when someone calls and thenhangs up, the machine will not hang up - then the voice comes on from the telephone company - if you would like to make a call -- then the warbelling dial tone which the machine records.Thompson can not fix itdo not buy"
2,Hello? Hello?,"After taking this phone out of the package I was immediately impressed. It was user friendly and a pretty major upgrade from what I was using before as the answering machine and caller ID were features I needed in one model. The answering machine has very poor sound quality, but I thought ""Hey, who cares about the answering machine"".Before I knew it I realized the phone did too. I changed channels, moved the base, walked around...but nothing helped. While you could turn the volume up, it sounded as if the person on the other end was holding a towel over the receiver. Not only that but when I talked there was a static echo. Sure I could get used to it, but it irritated me so much because my other cordless phone was clear as a bell....that I decided to take it back for a refund. The features were great, it's too bad the sound quality sucks. They should allow you to test models in the store before getting home."
5,A Valuable Crack-up!,"Lovers of Silverstein will cheer for this munny and fixed-up book! Only his cleverness could concieve of this original poetry. I think this title could win over non-poets, especially if challanged to read the book aloud! I couldn't believe how many times my brain tried to switch the letters back. This book is utterly readable and utterly original. What else could we expect from the beloved Shel Silvertein?"

1,(...),"I highly recommend you do not buy this product because there is nothing but problems with it. I have had many problems with it such as NAPSTER which is horrible and sucks. Napster just doesnt want to do want I want it to do and transfering the songs has messed up many times. All in all, samsung should burn all of the yh-920's because they are worthless and I recommend buying an IPOD. It has has brought me much happiness. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
2,Write What You Know!,"Having read a few of Ms. Rice's other novels, I was looking forward to this one, not the least because it was partly set in a part of Canada that I know very well.The story itself was not up to Ms. Rice's usual standards: the plot seemed contrived and the characters lacked credibility. More irritating, however, was the author's shoddy research. Ms. Rice's descriptions of hockey games were laughable, and her descriptions of the setting were downright ludicrous. Ms. Rice should stick to writing about topics she knows and understands, or make sure she is writing about fictitious places."
2,Can't wait for it to be over,"I probably have a chapter left to go and i can't wait for this book to be over. I get no pleasure out of the the main characters, I wouldn't want them as friends and I really wish they had more of a sense of humor. I don't get why Martin and May got together in the first place and why they felt they had to get married a few weeks after meeting. I couldn't find anything they had in common. I'm irritated by May's constant harping about Martin's father when it's absolutely clear Martin has good reasons for feeling the way he does.Spoiler -- Martin comes home late at night after a bruising hockey game and a three-hour drive to be with May and the first thing she does is talk about reconciling with his estranged father. When he says he needs to rest, she doggedly pursues the topic. What? What kind of spouse does that? I don't blame him for leaving either. In fact, I wish he'd never come back and then the book would be over."
2,Not a good book,"This was my first time reading Luanne Rice, and I must admit I wanted to read the book mostly for the hockey storyline. I was, unfortunately, very disappointed and couldn't even finish the book. The storyline was not believable. I had a hard time with May constantly staying after Martin to talk about Natalie and his father, and I couldn't figure out why she could not seem to understand why he was so upset with his father. I never got a sense of a great love between this couple either - there was nothing that made me really believe that they really were passionate about one another or had any ""sparks"" between them. I didn't really dislike either character, but they did not seem to fit one another. I also found some of the hockey aspects of the book to unbelievable - I won't get into details, but suffice it to say I wondered if there were any other players on the Bruins team or just Martin? The whole thing was just so sickly sweet that I couldn't stomach it."
2,"Nice model, but annoying call on hold beeps","IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE HOLD FEATURE OFTEN, RUN AWAY!! CHECKED WITH SUPPORT AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY OF DISABLING THIS ANNOYING ""FEATURE"".OTHERWISE HAS ALL BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU CAN EXPECT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS PHONE."
4,Wonderful Book!,"I enjoyed this book immensely! She, once again, touches on all the aspects of training, caring for, maintaining a strong bond with your dog, list goes on. I didn't give 5 stars only because there were so many pages of champions."
4,"If you own a shepherd , this book is for you","This book is without a doubt the best german shepherd dog book on the market today. It has a little something for everybody in it. History, training tips, pictures, its got it all. I especially like her inclusion of German dog show information. If there is anything that you need to know about this breed, it is definately in this book."
1,"Bad Design, Poor Reception","I value the Amazon Product Reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback. I purchased this phone from Home Depot for $69.95. I am returning it today. It is to large for comfort, the reception is bad, the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses... I could go on."
4,Fun book!,"I bought this book for my daughter's Christmas present. She was 16 months. Since then (almost 2 months later) this is one of the the most read and ""examined"" books by her. I think we look at/read it at least 3 times a day. The only downside to this book is my particular copy. This copy had some binding issues so that some of the lift flaps left spaces between the top page and the back page and she then figured out how to separate the actual pages from each other. I think it could have been put together a little better."
4,Great book for an elmo lover,My granddaughter loves this book - it goes with the movie and she is thrilled to read it over and over
4,Elmo's Blanket,My 1 1/2 year old granddaughter loves Elmo and she really has enjoyed this book. It allows for lots of interactive play.
2,flimsy,"I expected this ""board book"" to be a little more durable but the pages are thin and the pop-ups are like paper! An older child may enjoy this, but my infant isnt into it."
4,Worth getting for both Australian Crawl and James Reyne fans,"This is James Reyne's only live album and is it Great to hear some classic tracks along side his more recent ones. As the title says, this CD was recorded in RIO and it is quite funny to here james attempt to speak to the locals in their own tongue. See if you can pick where James gets the words wrong to 'Unpublished critics' !"
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read!,"I honestly don't know how they can seriously think this book is worth the asking price, I wouldn't waste the time on it if it were free. The only reason I bought it was because it was a requirement for a course I was taking, that is most likely the only way they will ever sell many copies. It is inconsistent in many places, none of the examples (what few there are) flow together in a consistent manner. Many topics are barely touched on, with no real detail and many with no examples that make sense. I have never reviewed a book before, but felt compelled to do so in this case. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with a book. For the life of me, I can't figure out how any school/professor that even glanced through this book would select it as a required text. Perhaps they get kickbacks? ;-)"
4,We're Aussies and Michael Moore Rulz,We thought this movie was great and hope to see a lot more films like this. It was very interesting to know what happens in America these days We think it's good to show Americans the truth. We think that its a great documentary and your point was put across very effectively. You shouldn't care what other people think they are just very hypocritical. All Americans that think Michael Moore is an arrogant soul well we have news for u. i think he is great for actually saying the truth about america GOD BLESS U
1,Bowling for??,"...Opportunistic events in the world to distort,lie and do whatever to get ""the Message"" across? in this case Michael Moore a Sad Dishonest Elitist Liberal doing more harm for ""the cause"" than good. This Movie is Dishonest at best,And Deceitful at worst.From Sneaking his slimey way into Charlton Heston's home and taking footage of him at a Republican Rally to making it seem as though Heston and the NRA are the bad guys with dishonest editing. He professes he's for the little guy while in fact he is ego-driven and money hungry.You have to feel sorry for the left if they think Little Mikey can help their cause. While Chomsky,Mailer,Vidal are slimey leftists,MM seems he's a Intellectual lightweight,a Little man and A Faux Documentary maker.Sadly the Left never looked so desperate to have this Man(if you can call him that) as their own."
3,Beware of dirty journalism,"I am glad Mike Moore can point out the hypocricies and general weirdness of his own country and it's people but he employs some incredibly dirty tactics here. Some of his ""facts"" are downright unfounded and shoddy and the integrity of some of his accusations should definately be questioned. In saying that, what he tries to achieve, his ultimate goal, is worthy and I commend him for that. He certainly has passion. If only he wasn't so one eyed and overly persuasive he'd have me sold totally."
1,A sorry excuse for an American,I'm absolutely disgusted by this man and after watching this DVD I must say that he is absolutely obnoxious. He complains about everything while bolstering his wallet and waistline with the money he is making from creating this trash. Save your money buy something good.
5,Michael Moore is an amazing human being.,"Michael Moore's films inspired my interest in politics. Two years ago I did not care at all about anything to do with social issues, and now I am active in my community. I think Michael Moore deserves more than an Oscar, he deserves to become President! ;)This is a very good film, my favorite thing that he has put out is Downsize This!, his first novel. Amazing book, infuriating facts that will make you rise up and fight for what is right.Thanks to Michael."
1,Lies betrayal and Mike Moore,"Mike Moore is the master of telling half-truths, misrepresenting issues, and promoting his immoral agenda, and all in the name of ""comedy"" and ""documentaries"" which apparently he feels are the same thing."
1,"Worthless use of Crew, Equipment, etc","Waste of my time...documentary? Hardly. I think Moore is the fool of the century. I used to respect him as a filmmaker, but now you couldn't pay me to watch anything this person generates given his stretch of truths which I can understand and respect if he wouldn't go and tout his work as factual. Had this been an accurate accounting of events, it would then be classified as a documentary."
1,Boring For Columbine,Moore is just another 60's left over doing his best to be clever. This film is about as exciting as a Greatful Dead record. Save your money!
4,funny but heartbreaking,"Michael Moore is an excellent satirist who actually cares enough to make a difference. He tries, and magically succeeds at changing one of the most horrid gun practices - bullet sales! He wisely poses the question to America - should guns be so widely and easily available?"
1,Extremely Tedious Tedious Tedious Tedious,"I am sure there was an agenda before their film was made. But what ever it was is lost in inconsistent and repetitious interview style questions. I did like the calendar girls; I did not realize you could get such calendars. The militia looked like a neat organization. When they do interviews with Canadians for contrast I thought I was watching ""Canadian Bacon"" with John Candy.They did mention nukes but did not go to the other extreme and count how many people were knifed and hacked (Lizzy Borden) due to the absence of a proper firearm. No mention of the fact than Kung Fu is necessary so one can kill when deprived of proper defensive devices.They seem to be fascinated with Charlton Heston. ""Home of the brave and Land of the free""; his presents is peppered throughout the film.I suspect that the title comes from the fact that the students in Columbine went bowling before their spree.Canadian Bacon"
4,it was a comedy...wasn't it?,"I laughed alot while watching it. It's a liberal point of view, and while I have many liberal points of view myself, I encourage people to do their own investigating of any issue. Though it is a disappointment that 'fair and unbiased' isn't part of media reporting anymore."
1,Arrogance unleased...,"This man is perhaps the most arrogant individual I have seen in quite sometime. Took the time he should have spent being thankful for recieving an an Academy Award (wrongly bestowed uopn him for this piece of left-wing [junk]) to bash the president on national television! Wrong time, wrong place to excersize the right of free speech protected by the military that he so ashmedly wronged by bashing their commander and chief. Shame on him. ""Bowling for Columbine"" is another example of wrong-mindeness passing for art and individuals profiting by it. Profiting, that is, if you buy it."
3,an interesting film that doesn't deserve it's vilification by the right,"I have to admit that I was surprised with this movie. After hearing it critized vehemently for it's supposed anti-gun stance, I expected a simple minded ""guns are bad, they kill people"" argument from Moore. Instead of the strident, one note polemic that I had expected, Moore examines the possible causes of gun violence in our country with some depth. He takes the NRA argument: ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" to it's next logical step: ""why do people kill people with guns?""Though I don't buy into many of Moore's arguments (trying to link the Kosovo bombing campaign to Columbine is ridiculous), the movie is entertaining. The humour is somewhat subdued when compared to Moore's other movies, but that is mostly due to the subject matter.All in all, it's a movie worth viewing several times."
1,"You're Kidding Me, Right?!","It was entertaining. I have to give it that. Beyond that, however, it was a joke. Documentary? If so, I would expect at least a few facts. You would think that he could at least get the titles of the people he intervied correct. FLINT does not have a sheriff. FLINT is a city. Hello?! And the rest of the movie was just as big of a factual nightmare. Comparing the actual numbers of gun deaths in the U.S. to those in other countries--countries that are merely a percentage the size and population of the U.S. (as opposed to using a per capita or percentage based number so it would actually mean something). Hello again?! Honestly, it was far more entertaining than I thought it would be and not nearly as inflamatory. But I strongly encourage you to not mistake anything you might see in this movie as actually being true or factual in any way. Just one more reason to be thankful that I am a life member of the NRA!"
1,This movie blew.,"An obvious work of fiction. I can't believe this loud mouth idiot actually won any awards for this vile crap. *IF* he would have presented a more even handed view, I'd probably be more merciful. Until then, may he choke on stale donuts."
1,Factually flawed and deceptive. NOT worth buying.,Full of misleading facts and statistics. This WORK OF FICTION is hard to watch. Call it Michael Moore's propaganda flik.
1,NOT a documentary,"A serious documentary should not express the film maker's opinion like this one does. This is the worst movie ever. Michael Moore should just move to his beloved Canada and not in the 2 million dollar apt at the Dakota where ironically John Lennon was killed by a GUN, and stop milking the city of Flint and America's problems. He is part of the problem he presents. He has shamelessly edited parts of the interviews to present his points of view. He simply does not present the truth, but only his personal opinions as if they were the truth, I found this ""documentary"" to be DISCUSTING and INSULTING TO ANYONE'S INTELLIGENCE."
2,Michael Moore is nothing more than a liar.,"Michael Moore is a liar. Liar. Pants on fire. Do NOT watch this movie. DOOOOOOO NOOOOOOT WAAAATCH THIIIIIIS MOOOOOVIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE unless you want lie, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lie and more lies."
1,"Totally biased, just plain wrong and total waste of time...","This movie is pure garbage. The facts just don't add up and Mr. Moore is proving the other side right and himself wrong by spouting off the propaganda as he does in this film. After watching a certain Canadian-made documentary about Mr. Moore and then watching this film again, I came away with the conclusion that Mr. Moore is overgrown baby who needs to grow up. I'm no lover of the NRA, but they come off as victims here and I feel like joining just to spite this fat, whining little baby...Michael Moore has ZERO credibility no matter what ""documentary"" he makes."
3,Would Have Been Interesting If...,"This documentry would have been more interesting if instead of going to Canada and comparing American gun crimes to Canadian's, Moore had instead made comparisons of gun crimes of different American cities and towns. Why is the gun crime rate in Washington D.C and Gary Indiana higher than it is in some other similar sized cities,or why is it lower in others?Also,I thought it would have been interesting for Moore to have gone to inner city areas that are known for gang violence with guns like Los Angeles,Chicago or Detroit and talk to gang members there about why they keep getting guns to do their violence? He could have interviewed some Crips and Bloods while he was in South Central L.A."
3,Somewhat Truthful But Also Some Hipe & Half Truths,"I did not agree with alot of Moore's ideas in this film and I have to find a little bit a fault with someone who uses obviously mentaly questionable people to get his point across. Not to mention his gurrila tactics for getting attention for his cause. Everyone should be alowed to have their cause to champion but I have a real problem with people who insist that it should be your cause too. No one should be forced to subscribe to any one elses ""this is the way the world should work"" ideas.I also believe that were some very definite half truths in this film. Not lies exactly but not really accurate either. Sometimes I wonder if his alienating tatics aren't doing more harm for the causes he champions than good. For example if someone who was a little less.....obnoxious had approced Dick Clark with the questions Michael had that they might have gotten a better response."
2,"[Two and a half stars out of Four] Charleton Heston 0, Mike Moore -1. Not one of Moore's best","Moore sets out to blame guns, ratherthan the people who make Prozac andother 'designer' seditives for themassacre at Columbine High Schooland runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself,Moses, better known as CharletonHeston. Heston, gentlemanly as heis defeats all futile argumentsMoore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftisthas v. the Second Amendment. Longlive the second Amendment, otherwisethe First Amendment is gone, too!Moore should wake and wise up. BetterMoore efforts that are highly recom-mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit9/11, Roger and Me and even the un-derrated Canadian Bacon!"
1,"I do my research, but do YOU, Mr. Moore?","We watched this, ahem, ""documentary"" in one of my college courses. It was the first Michael Moore film I'd ever seen, and I've had a firm dislike of the man ever since. The way he cut scenes and organized the whole movie, it had the feel of the propaganda films made in Nazi Germany. It was ridiculous, absurd, and sometimes downright insulting. He threw out facts that were completely false, or sometimes just implied something that had absolutely no basis in reality. What I couldn't disprove with knowledge I had off the top of my head, I was able to dismiss with 30 seconds of research in my dorm room. I suppose it's America, and everyone has the right to release propaganda full of lies, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy it."
1,As stupid man interviewing a lot of stupid people,"This has to be by far the most unintelligent ""documentary"" I have ever watched. Even more stupid then Moore's little points are the stupid people he interviews to make these points. Comparing the NRA to the Klu Klux Klan? Talking about the Smog in LA, and comparing that to gun violence? All his points can be summed up into one small sentence. Americans have more gun violence because we have the right to bear arms"". Period. Save your time and don't watch this film. If you are of below average intelligence and want to watch other stupid people make really stupid points which Moore edited together to make this really stupid film, by all means waste a couple brains cells and watch this crappy film."
5,Maybe ther eis hope for us yet...,"It's amazing how after repeated viewings of this film which is so depressing, and so troubling to the soul, that I might feel hope for us yet. There's something in this film, some latent truth, that causes thousands of right-wing conservatives to flip out beyond belief. Just look at how desperate people are to see this film burned in the fireplace. Why is that? Why are they not just chuckling and dismissing it as baloney? Because there's a frightening truth underneath all the horror and jokes and so forth.Maybe now that we have this film in our collective conciousness we can start to progress.A brillient documentary. Bravo!"
3,god forbid adults watch the news instead,"god forbid people actually look up this movie and find outthe facts for themselves and LEARN A THING OR TWO !!!!michael moore is one of the more controversial directors in american society, i admit. he does cover some of the fears regarding firearm saftey as well. but this movie is almost entirly cut and paste, with only a small part of the entire truth. the bank scene with the free rifles ? michael moore was at that banbk for FOUR HOURS while his backroung was checked with the F.B.I. data bases. yes, the check is instantaeneous if ones record is clean. also, in order to recieve a rifle (the rifles themselves are high quality and very expensive), one had to open an account, put massive quantities of monry in it, and then go to a SEPERATE LOCATION to recieve the rifle. as i sai previously, this movie is a cut and paste, partial truth movie."
2,Thought it was great until...,"It was pointed out to me how innaccurate it was. I used to walk around quoting the movie to all of my gun friendly friends, hoping it would help them see how needless guns really are. While I still agree with that message, I am growing more and more disappointed with his willingness to alter the truth to fit his agenda. I want the truth, whether it fit my point of view or not, and nothing deflated me more than learning how much he stretched the truth in the movie."
5,"this or ""Guide"" best for non-initiates","Cooper is the American Jean Genet and some aspects of his subject-matter may scare people off, but he writes amazingly beautiful prose, has an incredible ear for dialogue, and is quite funny even at his most dark. ""Try"" is actually a very appealing, offbeat love-story. Give Dennis Cooper a, well, try."
3,A 50/50 CD,"I do agree with the previous posts - this is not Gary Numan's best album. I think the Prince cover songs have a lot to do with the negativity sorrounding the CD. ""1999"" and ""You Got the Look"" sound strange and out of place. But there are a few brilliant moments on this CD:1. Skin Game - a great mechanical sounding wall of sound!2. Machine and Soul - Another good song amid the uninspired tracks.3. I Wonder - a great ballad with wonderful lyrics4. Cry - another awesome ballad5. Generator - The song has a definite dance clubfeel, but it actually works.The rest... well, it's just there. I'm a huge fan of Gary's music (I don't hate any of it) but I'd have to rank this one just below middle of the road."
2,NOT Bugakov's Heart of a Dog,"I was disappointed to realize this is NOT a translation of Bulgakov's Heart of Dog.Instead, it is an adaptation into a play.Perhaps the original hasn't been translated yet?I would like to read a translation of Bulgakov's actual text, which Russian acquaintances say is a brilliant comedy."
2,"Too much lost in translation, so to speak","Love dogs. Love Russian history. Love the idea of a book written from perspective of a dog with an eye on a pivotal point in Russian history. That's what this book is! Didn't love this book. The first part's a bit compelling for the very reasons I'd hoped it would be. Then, it dives into a tedious metaphor about communism and humanity that is a bit gross and dull. Probably seemed radical in its day. Now, just odd and dull."
3,too long to get to the climax,"obviously a classic, everyone should read this book at least once in their life just to say they have, but as for the story, I didn't enjoy it that much."
3,Reptile lamp,"Does the job. Only downside is that if you turn it off, will not turn back on until it cools down."
4,Ark Angle,"I like the fact that most of the story is a fact or a real thing. The stories are so fast in action, I can't put them down. And with my Kendle I go through three stories before I know it. I don't like the swearing and meanness that is in most adult stories. Yet these Alex Rider, stories teach and expand your mind."
3,Is it really for kids?,"Alex is a fourteen year old boy who has to go through many difficult events. I, as an adult, enjoyed the book; however, I do not believe that it is appropriate reading for those under 15 years. Within the first paragraph it talks about a man being killed, the words Kill/Killing are used four times within the first chapter, not to mention a detailed description of a death scene. In chapter 4, poor Alex is being tortured and the torturers are threatening to cut off his finger. This seems a bit violent for younger readers. It is action filled with lots of violence and blood, definitely a fast and enjoyable read for those who like such books. BEWARE parents as this series is being advertised to 4th grade and lower children."
5,Death in the Sky,"BANG! Ark Angel by Anthony Horowitz is an amazing book that will keep you reading until its over. Alex Rider manages to get himself into trouble again. After his near death from a sniper's bullet, Alex is staying at a hospital in London. When four armed men attempt to kidnap the boy next door to Alex, he pretends to be that boy only to be captured at a ransom. Alex is only then about to meet the biggest criminal in the world. ""You only have to sneeze at him and someone would call around at your house with a machine gun"".I give this book five stars because the action never stops. It starts on the first page and ends on the last. There are many shocking twists only to lead up to an all time climax. This book will have you on the balls of your feet the whole way!"
1,Too Much Of The Same,"While Erlbaum is sometimes a decent writer in this blog-like, breathless tome, it's something you've seen many, many times before in the last 20 years. It's not a new idea: sad people go the wrong way in a kind of Dante-like descent into hell as kids and then wake up to become fairly productive adults. Everyone's glad Erlbaum survived, but I have to agree with the review in the Baltimore Sun that says the book runs out of steam quickly. I'd suggest Cupcake Brown's ""A Piece of Cake"" for more insight...and more drama, too."
5,Wonderful. It wil change your life.,"I have read this book many times. The first time as a skeptic, he second time as seeker of truth and third time as a committed believer. This book will change your life forever and bring you closer to God and His Son, Jesus Christ. While I have always been a Christian, my wife and a foster son came from different non-christian religions traditions. Both were converted to belief in the Lord Jesus Christ by the Book of Mormon. This book lives up to its title page when it says that it is to the ""convincing of Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ"". The Bible is correct when it says that ""all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine"". Truly, this book is scripture as is the Bible and it stands as ""Another Witness of Jesus Christ""."
5,5 STARS or 1 STAR?,"The ratings for the Book of Mormon are strongly polarized - obviously some love it and some hate it. The question is, which is it really? Well, my vote says 5 stars. I read the entire book for the first time at age 13 ... and during the next six years read every single day, completing it over 20 times. If it can capture a teenager, it must be pretty amazing. I add my testimony that this really is a life altering book - it will bring a joy to your life that you never knew you could have!"
1,Show me the evidence,"I have read the Book of Mormon eight times. Almost 25% of it is copied from the Bible. The book claims that two separate groups of Semites sailed across the ocean to the Western Hemisphere. Some of these Semites turned from God and were cursed with a dark skin becoming a huge tribe called the Lamanites. The Lamanites are supposedly the Amerindians or current natives of North, Central and South America. There has been no archaeological or DNA evidence to support this tale. If you buy this book and read it, do so for metaphor, allegory and mythological purposes only."
1,More then a book,"Indeed this book is more then any other book. In the mormon religion it's as esteemed as the Bible. (halla!) That's not the point. If you want to learn about the mormon religion, read this on your own without anyone else. Then read the doctrine and convenants. No, don't look at your mormon friends and neighbors, sometimes they just live lives of deception. They try so hard to make it seem so perfect, but it's really not. They just have a high tolerance for crappy stuff.I dunno, take your time before you dive into the church..."
5,THE TRUTH,"I have read the BofM 2-3 different times. It is a spectactular witness of Christ and the Acient Americans. I read it everyday. The stories contained in this scripture help to motivate me to try harder to be better. They uplift me. I feel more spiritual. It makes me a better father and husband. In the Bible it states in Ezekiel 37:15-19 that there is a stick (acient book) that is from the middle east (bible) and one from acient America (BofM) and that the Lord states that they should be joined into one and to be used for the good of man.Jesus Christ lives. He walked the Americas after his ressurection and taught the people. ""Other sheep I have that are not of this fold...I am the good shepard and know my sheep and are know of mine.""I bare my testimony that the Book of Mormon is a true book of God and it was brought forth in Gods time by his prophet.Bruce, UT"
1,Wrong,"Unsupported, contradtroy, please don't waste your money. Try the Bible (any non NWT or JST) for some good non-fiction and Pilgrams Progress for some good fiction. Please I beg you."
1,Not Worth the Paper It's Printed On,The book is appropriate for those who wish to read a poorly written piece of fiction created by a madman.
1,"I read the book twice, but Mark Twain summed it up..","Mark Twain made a somewhat in-depth review of the Book of Mormon after reading it, but he summed it all up when he said that the book was ""chloroform in print"". It will put you to sleep. He said the most amazing thing about the authoring of the book was that the author didn't put himself to sleep writing it."
1,Boring Boring Boring,Very poor grammar. Very hard to read because it is such a bore. It will surely put you to sleep.
1,An Actual Review,.... As a book of non-fiction I found the general theme for the story to be unbelievable. The idea that Christainity could have existed before Christ is a huge error in logic in the storyline. To believe that gold plates were hidden by God and then found by man and then NOT used to create a translation (rather a method of pschic translation was used) but then taken back by God anyway is absurd.As a work of fiction I found the story to be disjointed and poorly thought out. The imagry used to describe the various types of animals in existance in this fictional world was interesting as were the battle scenes. If this were to be reviewed as a fictional work it might be worth a 3 star. BUT AS A non-fiction work it is a 1 star only because this rating system doesn't allow any lower.
1,Pure fiction,"Don't waste your time with the Book of Mormon. Not only is it false, it is filled with historical inaccuracies (such as claiming that horses existed in the New World centuries before the Spanish introduced them) but it also doesn't even support the main tenents of Mormonism. The Mormon Church teaches that there is more than one god; the BOM says there is only one; the Mormons require baptism for the dead; the BOM makes no mention of baptism for the dead. Mormons teach that men can become gods; the BOM makes no mention of such a doctrine.It is fake. It has no more spiritual value than reading the phone book. Don't waste your time with it."
1,"If you are looking for a meaning in life, LOOK DEEPER.","The LDS church instills the idea that if a person reads this book, prays with real intent and faith in Christ, that he/she will receive personal revelation (a burning euphoric feeling that the book is religious truth). WARNING: do not read this book with the intent of finding a personal testimony. With the tools that the church provides and a some determination, the human mind IS capable of concocting just such a thing, but the fact that this is possible certainly does not make the church's claims true. Mind control is a real danger.The real truth is that anyone who actually experiences such a ""moment of clarity,"" should still use a critical mind to assess everything. Such bold claims for personal sacrifice should be made to stand up to scrutiny. Irreverence is the only way left for testing our universe. Ignoring such crucial parts of yourself that are screaming out with suspicion will only obliterate your self esteem over time (see [...] )."
5,The Book of Mormon:Another Testament of Jesus Christ,"The title says it all; this is another testament of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I cannot remember how many times I have read this book and it brings peace, comfort and hope in troubled times as well as in good times, each and every time I read from its inspired pages.The people in this book are real, they really lived here on the American Continent thousands of years ago and they knew of God and his teachings. They looked forward to the time when Jesus Christ would be born and live on earth. They lived through times of peace and times of war, times of belief and righteousness and times of rebelliousness and turned away from God. Sounds a lot like our world today doesn't it? You can find answers to any problem or issue in your life today in this powerful book. It is true scripture."
5,THIS BOOK IS FREE,Call the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.This book is free! They will send you a copy.
5,Is it scripture?,This is a beautiful book that I have read many times. It is the work of god and I recomend it to anyone who wants to learn more about god and his dealings to other of his children. Since the bible takes place primarily in jerusalem this book takes place in central and south america. The book of mormon explains how god teaches his children all over the world not just in one area.
5,The Book of Mormon,what a wonderful book this is! in companionship with the holy bible it is a wonderful way to learn abot God and the meaning of life. it truly is another testament of Jesus Christ.
4,It's great for many things,"Since I have come to realize the true nature of this book and the church that claims it to be holy scripture, I have found it still has many good uses:1. It makes a great doorstop.2. It makes a pretty good paperweight.3. It's a good paper for wrapping presents for X-mas.4. It's a good source of racist references.5. It has absorbent sheets of paper: great for the occasional coffee spill.6. It's good for getting rid of Jehovas witnesses - try to give it to them as they try to give you the Watchtower.7. It works great to scare a ""naughty"" pet: throw it across the room in their direction- makes a nice thud. *note*-try not to actually hit the pet.8. It's good for evening out that wobble on your kitchen table: rip off desired amount and place under uneven leg9. It worked great to make ""hills"" under my batting in my Christmas village.10. It is better than any prescription sleep aid I have ever tried. There's a reason there's a chapter called The Book of Ether."
5,Remarkable book!,I'll never understand why some are so adamantly opposed to the Book of Mormon. I've found it to be a remarkable book. One of my very favorites!
2,Who thought murder and bloodshed could be so BORING?,"Any good Mormon will tell you that Joseph Smith had a fifth grade level education when he dictated this book to his scribes, and boy does it show. The book is a repetitive, juvenile, uncoordinated, rambling chore to read, written in the lowest style imaginable. There are wars and stuff on just about every page and Christ comes and everything but the plot and all the characters are poorly developed. What is a secret combination? Apparently you have to read it a whole lot of times to make any sense out of it, but it certainly isn't worth the effort."
5,"Read it, then decide for yourself.",It would be interesting to know how many of the people who only gave this book 1 star have actually read it.Having actually read the book I can tell you that it will teach you many principles that if you implement them in your life will bring you more joy and happiness and less pain and misery.But don't take my word for it. Read the book and decide for yourself.
5,Life Changing,"This book is the work of God! Read it, ponder it, pray about it, may you come to know as I have that this book is of God and not of man.Prove all things, hold fast to that which is good. 1 Thess 5:21"
1,When I was a member of the LDS Church...,"... I read it several times, in English, German and French. It would usually put me to sleep (especially the Book of Izzzzzaiah). But I did enjoy the wars and battles, especially when the good guys won. I wanted to be one of those stripper warriors, who would never die, but who returned from war with honor.Now, as I think back on the BoM, I'm sure glad ""IT CAME TO PASS"" and that it didn't ""COME TO STAY."""
1,"Polygamy, hating blacks, females, Indians, sex with 14 YO","Joseph Smith was a hideous person, and came up with a great scam. Oh, nothing wrong with a little polygamy, you say? What about Joseph pressuring a 14 year old girl to marry him so that her family will go to the Celestial Kingdom? What about him marrying other mens' wives because the men weren't righteous enough?Blacks weren't allowed to hold the priesthood (a position of leadership in the church that righteous men have) until 1978. Women still cannot.The list goes on and on, as you have seen from some of the other more lengthy reviews.This is a hideous book from a hideous church. I know firsthand, as I was brainwashed into believing it. Upon leaving, although I feel like weights have been lifted and I have gotten my life back, my familial relationships have suffered."
1,Use it as a paperweight.,"As believing mormons during our teenage years, they literally had to BRIBE us to read the Book of Mormon... that's how tedious and incoherent it is. Don't waste your money; any mormon you meet will give you one for free anyway (if you really feel the desire to read it, that is). Besides, you don't NEED to join the mormon church (it's no fun, believe me). According to their beliefs, you can just join after you die, and you'll still get into heaven. Saves you a hell of a lot of money to do it that way. :-)"
1,Level of reading,"The wording in many passages of this book makes me think that this was not written by an ancient people in ""reformed Egyptian"". One only has to find an earlier edition to see all the spelling and grammar errors that have plagued this book for many decades. Reading this book for a fictional account of the history of the Americans is still dull. There is too much plagiarizing of the Christian bible."
2,American mythology,Historical accuracy is way off but a common speculation at the time of original publication (1830) As a fiction this book is rather dull. It is written in King James english style. Many passages are ver batum KJV Bible. It is a curiosity how this book inspired a new American religon.
1,Promise is faulty. Book is a fraud.,"The promise in the book is that you will know the book is true if you pray sincerely. That is a silly way to determine the truth of something. This is the flimsy foundation of most Mormons' faith. I have never heard of a single nonMormon scholar who accepts the Book of Mormon as historic. It is over 500 pages and covers many aspects of several cultures, and yet in 170 years, no outside scholars have accepted it as an historical book? That is amazing. Perhaps Satan has a lease around the necks of all scholars who are not Mormon? I'll let Occam's Razor cut where it will. It is a fraudulant book written by a flim flam man. And to think I wasted my time reading it over a dozen times-once in Chinese. It is good to be at peace and away from the mental illness called Mormonism."
1,NOT another testament of Jesus Christ,Stick with the true Gospel of Jesus Christ: the New Testament. The book of Mormon is just a book written and sold by cultists. Remember the verse at the end of the book of Revelations? Anyone who adds to the Bible will have plagues added to him. Don't buy this book. The locations mentioned in this book have never even been found. Go buy a Bible instead of this trash.
1,Nothing more than a work of fiction!,Customers who purchased this book would also enjoy these fine works of fiction:Star WarsHarry PotterWilly Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryToy Story
5,A Book Worth Reading,"I read this book when I was 18. My mother always wanted me to be religious but never forced me to go to one church or another. She was a devout Mormon but participated often with a local protestant church. In three weeks I finished the book and took the challenge at the end ask God if it was truly from him as an indicator that his church was restored. I had an amazing experience which included a feeling rush over me that was indescribable. The experience and many others have led me to become fully active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. If this book is read with an open heart one will begin to believe that it was not written by a boy by must have been translated by the gift of God.I think, like most religious texts, it is a must read."
5,UNDOUBTEDLY,"i would have to say that i know that this book is really true. you have to really want to know of its truthfulness in order to have the promise at the very end. those who say it is not true doesn't really know anything. people who dig up old civilizations on the american continent are sure that they are not just put there by some prankster. so is the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith did not have enough education- only at a 3rd grade level. He was not able to know much, and have the ability to make things up as some claim. and this book is not written by Joseph Smith- he just translated it."
5,Best Pill Organizer We've Found!,"Of all of the pill organizers that we've tried, this is by far the best! Some of the pills that my Husband takes for his diabetes are quite large in size and I was very pleased at the ease of getting all of them into each compartment. It takes a bit to get used to having the square shape if you're used to putting the pills into one of the long straight pill holders, but it's well worth the adjustment. And the lids are nice and snug, so you don't have to worry about them coming open and your pills falling out either."
1,Sent wrong item..hard to open,Purchased 4 of these..got 4 of the wrong ones..going to Give them one more shot and reorder and hope that I get the right ones. These seem a bit hard to open as well.
4,Large!,"I take a large number of herbal supplements and these are perfect for dividing up my pills. My only warning is to be careful when pulling the tops off for refilling - I ended up breaking off the ""evening"" door on one. It still works, but it's just a warning."
4,Great for Multiple Pills @ Multiple Times,"This is perfect for what I need. I take different vitamins/pills 4X/day. This one has the 4 separate compartments to allow you to fill specifically for each time of day. It's great to just take the day's pill box out of the tray, toss it in my bag, and go without having to lug around a huge pill organizer. I looked at a few others but kept coming back to this one and I'm really glad I did! Also, it fits a lot of pills in each compartment - currently I'm taking 7 pills in the AM alone and this fits them all - although I don't think I could fit another one in there which is fine for me, but if you take more than that or if your pills are all very large (some of mine are medium/large but most aren't very big) you might need one with bigger compartments."
2,DISAPPOINTING,the containers were too difficult to open. the amount of space was what i needed but we wont be using it daily as hoped.
3,Confusing When Filling,I like the convenience of being able to take one day of meds with me in my purse. But the boxes are really confusing when you are trying to fill them with several meds and supplements. The larger compartments were what I really needed. The inline boxes are less confusing but they don't have large enough compartments.
5,Great product,Very satisfied with this product. Pill boxes are sturdy and big enough to hold multiple medications. The colors are pleasing and make it easy to differentiate the days. I will likely buy another one so I can have two weeks of pills sorted at once.
4,Works great for parents.,"I bought these for my 80 year old parents. Each were taking several medications 3 and 4 times a day. It was becoming a nightmare for them to dose the medications correctly. The compartments are deep enough to hold several pills and each day container is easily stored in a purse or pocket if they are out for the day. I do wish, though, that we could have bought different colors for Mom and Dad. As it is, we had to mark each tray and container so they could tell which set belonged to Mom and which to Dad."
5,Getting started on your writing,Excellent way to get going on that mystery novel. The exercises direct your thinking about your plot and characters. Answering her questions makes the characters especially come alive and the story takes off from there!!!
5,debz,"Purchased as a gift, the recipient loves this item and purchases the new addition annually, she swears by it when selecting restaurants to try."
3,"Excelente obra, pero pésima edición en versión de Kindle","El libro es bueno, como todos los de Gabriel García Márquez, pero en su versión para Kindle es vergonzosa la edición realizada por la firma española Leer-e. Lo acabo de leer y encontré 29 errores de todo tipo (palabras que sobran o faltan, signos de puntuación mal puestos, etc.). Pareciera que no revisaron bien el producto de un texto escaneado. ¿Como es posible que una editorial manche así el prestigio de un escritor ganador de Nobel de Literatura?"
4,good to a see an old friend,"It's good to see Lolita Files back in the writng game. I have missed her books and her stories. This book gives great in- sight to where the characters have been and where they are headed next. This book screams for a sequel!! I like that she managed to bring readers up to date while showing a glimpse of the past throughout the book. I read this book in two days it was sooo good. I ony gave it four stars because the ending does leave you hanging for answers. Otherwise, great read!!"
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in ""Tastes like Chicken."" When I saw it in the bookstore I didn't even think twice once I saw who had written it. I have read all of Ms. Files books and was looking forward to continuing the saga of Reesy Snowden and Misty Fine. I felt that the story line was rushed and silly. Ms. Files left a lot of loose ends possibly because there will be a fourth installment to this book. In my opinion she could have closed the saga of these two women and made this the last book. Faithful readers like myself will purchase the next chapter of Reesy and Misty's ups and downs because we hope that the continuing saga will be better than its previous chapter. I would suggest that you wait until this book comes in paperback or borrow it from a friend."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for home brewers",This is an excellent reference for anyone interested in brewing beer. It explains everything you need to know step by step in great detail. All the arcane details are fully explained and easy to find if you need to go back and look something up. A great book!
4,Amtrak's Empire Builder,"This dvd provides a review of the train trip from Seattle to Chicago via Amtrak's Empire Builder. It is a pretty good discussion of the highligts of the train trip and some of the interesting points along the way. Good video of the scenery. Good discussion of Seattle; history, current attractions. Recommended for those interested in an overview of the trip.An other dvd to consider is ""The Empire Builder - Discovering the great NorthWest"" by Green Frog Video (also available here at Amazon) for about $35 new. That video is much more expensive but does a bit better job of covering some of the locations/cities along the train trip. It was produced by a TV station in Spokane, WA.This video is recommended as a good value for the price."

1,Cordless Unit Battery Does Not Hold Charge,"Bought in July 2004, but won't pay freight and so forth to try to collect on warranty after reading other reviews. Nothing but problems holding charge in the battery. Replaced original battery about a month ago, followed instructions precisely for new charge, ok for about one week, and now back to not holding a charge. Useless Junk."
2,cordless unit makes a constant hissing sound,"I've had this phone for about 2 months and only give it a 2 because the corded phone seems to work well. The cordless unit has this irritating ""feature"" where the earpiece emits a constant hissing sound when docked to the charger. Seems the noise kicks in when the unit has reached full charge... then you need to remove it from the cradle to silence it. Pretty odd - based upon this and other reviews... don't get this phone!"
2,Functional,"Corded with cordless is a good concept.The cordless handset is difficult to keep a charge, even after draining and recharging to full several times and trying replacing the battery.You can't change the number of rings the answering machine picks up after, which is permanently set to only 3. So if you don't pick up a phone after 2 rings, you'll be talking over the outgoing message and your conversation will be recorded.Volume on the main unit is very low at maximum setting when trying to listen to messages, yet the beep on every button press is overpowering.BTW, there IS a red flashing light that tells you when you have a voice message, and I tested and determined that voice messages are still kept after a brief power outage.Overall, the phone is functional, but there must be better options out there."
2,Not a great buy,"The corded phone works fine but we have had nothing but trouble with the cordless handset. The battery dies constantly and won't hold a charge. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the numbers on the keypad stick so that that number dials two to three times. Forget making a long distance call. Definitely do not recommend, I am only giving it 2 stars because the corded phone and answering machine work fine."
2,Anticlimatic,"I enjoyed Bangkok 8, so I decided this book would be worth a read. The first half was very well done, albeit with a few annoyances (overruse of Farang, weak narrator voice, idiotic CIA characters), but it really deterioated once the tattoo artist came into the story. The intriguing plot between Zinna and Vikorn was completely dropped. And the last 50 pages were so ridiculous and uninteresting that it was only with great force did I finish the book. Not reccommended."
4,bookclubber,A great book that requires you to think. Examine a story from many different perspectives and realize that there is no true view of any events.
3,Good premise but went slowly,"I tried but I could not get into this book. I made it 85% through the book before I gave up. The book is lengthy and, with the exception of a few sections, is disappointingly slow. It IS an intellectual book with good points and comparisons but the drawn out nature is its biggest downfall."
5,Dysfunction in 7D ! ! !,"Alex: The PsychiatristAngelique: The ProstituteSimon: The Ex-Educator who's taken a liking to spiking the milk on his cereal w/SCOTCHJoe: The StockbrokerMitch: An Analyst for a StockbrokerageAnna: Simon's Ex-Girlfriend; Joe's Wife?????: Surprise NarratorThese 7 people's lives are intrinsically interwoven; however, each individual's perception of the circumstances, events, and outcomes within this book differ--sometimes dramatically. Each of these players narrates from his/her own unique position on the chessboard of day-to-day living. We are able to see how one's life experiences and circumstances boldly color their assessment of any given situation; i.e., LIFE is AMBIGUOUS and Perlman has masterfully re-created one tiny wedge of the big picture for us to sample and ponder.Stupendous Read! It's quite lengthy, but NEVER boring."
4,Response to SMF 2001,"Just a quick response to SMF 2001 who was responding to ""reader from California.""Francis Schaeffer, although a great asset to the church, was significantly flawed in certain areas of his apologetic.I'll recommend to you Greg Bahnsen's review of Schaeffer here: http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/PA089.htmThanks."
5,comprehensive collection,"this collection is well printed and bound, contains all the books in 5 easy to handle volumes, good clear fairly large text and diagrams accurately reproduced. Francis wrote the foreword to this collection and explains some minor differences in the printing to previous stand a lone books.an excellent buy"
5,Rubinek puts you in the middle of the action,"A group of men are haunted by a past misdeed. When thier group starts to die off in mysterious ways they think they know who dunnit and they want him stopped. They petition Nero Wolfe to save the day. Before it's all over, a woman gets the best of Archie. Honest!"
1,Nero Wolfe-fans - unite,Even if I did not rate it more than 3 stars it was so good to find and read one I had not read before. Also the comments on this being an early book was interesting.
3,Warning: Anti Japanese Wartime Film,"While the film used to make this DVD has lines and splices, it is sharp and clear. When you see the story content you will understand why.Made during WWII, the boys talk about killing Japanese. This film was pulled from Television syndication a while back, so the only original prints around are a bit old.In comparison, try to find a copy of the 3 STOOGES anti-Japanese film ""THE YOKES ON ME"". Japanese owned Columbia will not release that through their Sony DVD division.Take this film in its historic context and watch a rare piece of 1940's B-Hollywood influenced by the war."
4,Good headphones for the price,"I've been using these in the office for several months now and they work fine. Decent sound quality, chord is long enough so it's not yanking on me when I plug it into the radio. I've taken them on several flights now, they work ok for hearing a movie / mp3 while in flight, but they definitely are not noise cancelling. Collapsable enables you to toss into the laptop bag while moving around and not be in the way.All in all, I'm happy with the ~$20 I spent on them."
4,Another Helpful RoughGuide,"We havent traveled to Sicily yet to put the book to its big test, but in planning for the trip it has been very helpful...telling us what to absolutely not miss, good places to stay and eat, and insider things off the beaten path."
5,Works Great,"Works, great, easy install, does everything that I wanted it to do for a great price., Would definitely recommendto anyone"
4,pleasant read,"I enjoyed this book because I dream of getting my own boat and sailing the ocean on my ""home"". The author combines facts of living aboard with tales from the islands, enchanting is the first word I can think of to describe the book."
5,An Embarrassment of Mangoes,"This is such a fun book -- travel log - receipes - adventures and sailing!It makes you feel like to are on the journey with them, I only wish I could find more books by this author."
1,This is not an accurate reprint,"I don't know if Garth Williams re-drew his illustrations for this reprint, but the cover is obviously different from the original. The line quality is much spikier, the characters' facial expressions are more cartoony, and details have been changed, such as the removal of the little toy car at the bottom center which used to be part of the image. The changes are easy to see if you compare to the picture of the 1980's reprint posted by William G. Elliott.If publishers are going to change illustrations, they should call the book a ""reinterpretation"" or ""revised version"", rather than a ""reprint"", which implies that there have been no changes. The different cover makes me wonder what else has been changed in this version of the book. Maybe the inside pictures and text are all the same, but it's impossible to tell from the book's Amazon page."
3,Doesn't fit.,"Product claims to fit 2001 Hyundai Santa fe and even includes specific installation instructions for the Santa fe. Amazon's ""make sure it fits"" also says it fits the 2001 Santa fe.I could not get it to fit my 2001 Hyundai Santa fe so I am disappointed it said it would. There is a slight gap at the top and bottom and the dash trim doesn't fit around it so I couldn't snap the trim back in place. I had to bend the trim around it an screw it back in so the trim is being held in place by two screws. I'm lucky that I didn't break the trim and suspect that it probably will break in the future from the stress.The product also isn't very durable. Once it is installed it's not really a problem, but it may arrive broken.Since there aren't many options out there and it is a single din that holds a deck I gave it 3 stars."
2,"Nice, small, but EXTREMELY fragile.","I own the 2GB version of this drive. It is tiny, but still fits nicely into a USB port, but I have noticed a serious problem. The flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in (you can see it on the bottom). I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports. Regardless, the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top, and the bottom corners of the plastic shell (that go into a USB port) have started snapping off in little chunks."
1,I can't play the darn thing,"My computer freezes when I try and play this game which is completely and totally amazing to me.I just got done playing Doom 3 which is far more of a resource hog. So, I can only guess how good this game is. I even went online and got the update. So, my advice is don't waste your money. It is a dog.Update: OK, I did some research, which I should have done first... there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a CD burner... the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cd's you'll try and make illegal copies of the disk! Instead of burning copies, I think I'll just burn the original. Or perhaps drive over it with my car. And then burn it. Or perhaps.... stupid Ubisoft!"
5,Nice Smelling Colonge,"I really love the smell, so I had to get this for someone as a gift. I hope that they like it as much as I like smelling it. lol"
1,Vapid and mildly offensive.,"Remembering the light-hearted enjoyment I got out of watching the film version, I thought I'd indulge in a little mindless summer reading and pick up the book. I found, not unlike some other reviewers, that the likeable, smart and believable character of the film often bears little resemblance to the spoiled and uninteresting character of the book. I didn't care what happened to her, I wanted to smack her pretty often, and there were even moments when I hated her and found her repulsive, such as when she described her new flatmates as investment bankers, Indian, and basically undistinguishable. In my books, this is unexcusable racist flap trap, and it gets two hearty thumbs down from me."
1,story not attractive nor convincing,"While the most prominent character is the always unreasonable, offensive & bitchy female boss, it's actually a story about the tension between family/friend commitmt & personal life vs career. I don't find the story attractive nor convincing, perhaps in Asia (& particularly HK), ppl have already got used to long working hrs, tight deadlines & demanding business reqts.What really interested me was the privileges enjoyed by the bitchy boss - if she was so unreasonable, why ppl around have to put up with it in the first place? I mean, they could have found another job if they couldn't stand her - so actually it's they have DECIDED to accommodate her. But why? The story said she was really brilliant & talented - so I guess after all, the motto is: one has to excel in his/her field to be a leader."
3,Absolute power corrupts absolutely,Wow. This was a first for me. My wife wanted me to read this as I am a teacher of English and History. Chick Lit is becoming a respected genre of its own. So I set out to read this along with a few others. I thought this was very good. And was a new way of telling the age old slave and master relationship story. Would the working girl be corrupted by her evil boss? I think it will make a better film than a book. Meryl Streep and Ann Hathway are playing the leads. I ultimately found Nanny Diaries the jewel in the crown of this genre.
2,Light and Entertaining,"It's a fun escape--certainly fun to read delicious nastiness about someone so rich and successful, but the writing is quite weak. Good book for a long plane ride or a beach vacation."
1,Get over yourself... it's called the Real World,"Having worked as a veteran in the fashion and media industries, I had expected to enjoy this book as a witty skewering of the characters we have all known or had the experience to work with. Instead, I had the misfortune to read a badly written, whining account of some hick who can't take paying her dues like everyone else. It's so sad that some privelaged, undeserving lucky-break candidate can make this amount of press and sales simply for implying that the book might spill good dirt on people. Shame on the idiot media-types who bought into this book."
1,When will it end?,"I looked forward to this book as an avid reader of magazines such as Allure, In Style, and Vogue. However, I found that Andrea was selfish, spoiled and self-absorbed, before landing the job at Runway. She was a completely unlikable character and the book itself ended in a totally foreseeable way. ARG! What a waste of money!"
1,...,"i loathe this book! it was given to me as a gift and unfortunatley it's like watching a train wreck - no matter how much i don't want to read it or continue, i have to just for my own sense of accomplishment. it's is such a contrived piece of rubbish that i am embarrassed to be seen reading it. the main character tries so hard to come across as this do-gooder when all you want to do is call her out on what a hypocrite she is. i think the author is trying to project what she wants to be into the spineless little fashionista character she has not so craftly designed in this ""novel"" (re: laughing).and just when you thought it was over with the book, i have heard that there is a movie in the works. yikes!!! stop the insanity.for a really good read, check out the dive from claussen's pier or the corrections."
2,What a reversal,"My boyfriend and I saw The Devil Wears Prada when it came out and it definitely made me interested in checking out the book.There's no denying that the book latched onto something in the culture at the right time, but jeez, it's so poorly written and structured, it's hard to see why it caught on.The movie's pretty good, though."
3,OK and overrated,"This is your typical young college graduate aspiring to be a writer living in NYC. I have read a 1000 books with this storyline. It is OK but not as good as the hype it has received. I finished the book but it only kept my interest, easy to put down each night."
3,"You'll keep saying ""Enough already... get on with it!""","The problem with this book, although it is entertaining, is that it could just about be cut in half. We didn't need quite that many chapters to agree with how horrible the boss is to everyone. Any other aspect of the main character's life was so outnumbered by the Miranda stories that it didn't have much depth. Which, left the ending to seem succinct and missing something. I'm glad I read ""Everyone Worth Knowing"" first because it was pretty much the same scene but more entertaining. I doubt I'll read Weisberger again- I'm just not into the pretentious, high society fluff. I'd much rather read wittier, more down-to-earth entertainment from the likes of Whitney Gaskell or Janet Evanovich."
2,Waiting for the Movie,"I perused this book when it first came out but didn't find it very interesting. Then when I saw Meryl Streep in the movie preview, I thought I'd give the book a try. Well, my initial instincts were correct. I struggled through the first 50 pages, all the while hoping the movie would be better. It's just not very well written."
2,What a monster!,"Am I talking about the boss? NO! Though her exploits were laughably over the top it's ANDREA that really shocked and appalled me. Why did she think it fine to rip off the company for personal expenses? Why did she think it was cute to tip a hundred dollar meal into the trash and throw away china, silver, and accessories away as well? Why did she feel obliged to wipe greasy hands all over her boss's expensive clothes? All of these petty little acts just turned my stomach.She was the real monster of the book as far as I'm concerned. If she hated her job and those around her so much she should have quit. I found nothing admirable about her or her high horse."
1,This was so bad - what the heck did the publisher pay for?,"With all the hype, I was expecting something different - as in a well written, interesting book. Instead, it was so boring I had to stop before I even read 75 pages. How many times can you read, ""I want to work for the New Yorker"" and page after page of ""horrible"" things her boss does. Where's the story? Where's the character depth and something beyond the obvious? I love chic lit, so it's not like I wanted War and Peace, but the people in the book aren't characters, they're charicatures, kinda like a bad sit com. It's her first book, so I don't really hold it against the author, but the publisher and editor should have known better. This was just such a weak effort, you've gotta wonder what the heck they were thinking."
1,Interest Ends at the Title,"With a catchy title containing the words ""devil"" and ""prada,"" as well as a comparison (not glowing, however) to ""The Nanny Diaries,"" this book caught the attention of many readers. Thus, a top ranking on the best-seller list for many, many months. However, lacking any type of textual flow, over-use of flowery and unnecessary adjectives, and extreme drama over issues that the typical person would consider ridiculous, this book should be considered a waste of time. The tantalizing New York fashion gossip aside, it lacks any depth and most readers will likely find it difficult to empathize with, sympathize with, or even hate the central character of the story. Simply put, Lauren, it's no ""War and Peace."" She could have ended the book saying ""HA, I helped you waste money, since this book is like reading high school gossip!"" Because, for the first time in a lifetime of reading, I put a book down without finishing it. Readers are better served elsewhere."
2,Not another one of these books.,"I'm so tired of this genre. Bridget Jones has ruined it for us as publishers churn out this kind of garbage just because it sells well and we continue to buy it. I can't bring myself to purchase anymore stories about women that just graduated from college and their day-to-day stories about life, love and living in the big city. This book is like a cheesy Cosmopolitan fiction excerpt only much longer. This story is not shocking, I don't find any of the tales surprising and to top it off, the writing style is horrible. The author just tries too hard to shock and its way too obvious."
2,Aaaaaaaaaargh,"Why why why? Why do people think this book is good? Why do people find anything to like about these characters whatsoever? Horrible, despicable people, and I know, it's all in the name of comedy, but it's just not funny. Glad it is to some, but I don't want to hang out with those people, then. And the writing is atrocious. I've tried hard, really I have. I got all these books for my birthday and I really don't want to return them because my mom got them for me and I'd feel awful, but why why why?Why?"
2,"Fun in the vein of ""The Nanny Diaries""...but reader beware","If you liked the ""The Nanny Diaries,"" you will probably like this book. The reader warning is this: if you like good writing (strongly written characters, strong plotline, things like that), get another book. To be honest, I think the author should have stuck with stories about her experience at work (much more fun to read about a ridiculously demanding boss, free designer clothes and running around in Jimmy Choo heels all day than supposed character development tangents involving increasingly strained relationships with her boyfriend and troubled best friend). In short, I think she should have focused on the job; it was hilarious to read about the world of high fashion and the people who inhabit it--but there was too much focus on the main character's personal life and motivations. A fun, mindless read nevertheless--a step up from watching reruns on TV, if you will."
2,Lost $10,"I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?"
2,Don't waste your money!,"I'm just going to get straight to the point, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK! I didn't even read all of it, it was THAT bad! It had way to many details then conversation. The main character seeme like a total B**** and it just was slow! DON'T BUY IT, SEE THE MOVIE INSTEAD! I LOVED the movie."
4,a must read! (but only if you know what prada is),"i really enjoyed the devil wears prada because it was relatable to my place in life. i am a college student and someday hope to obtain a job in journalism. i also try to keep up with fashion designers and trends, but it is somewhat low on my priority list as a college student. the book kept me interested and entertained, but the writing style sometimes had me doing double takes to see what character was speaking or where they were located. i wouldn't recommend this book to someone unfamiliar with fashion or who does not like long plots - this book seemed to drag on conflicts for awhile before something exciting happened. overall a great read and i enjoyed it much better than the movie!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype !,"On the surface there were a couple of amusing moments but this was a depressingly cliched and formualic piece of fiction . What really disappointed me was the lack of rythmn vibrancy and energy in the novel ,the author never fully caputuring the mood and atmosphere of a busy Fashion House . At best this was a stilted memoir of a Fashion Intern desperate to be something more . None of the characters are fully explored and there are weaknesses in plot structure and narrative . An endless array of mind numbing vacuosity none of which is glossed with salacious gossip or anything you can chew on . Another piece of mediocrity falling victim to its own hype ."
3,"""The Devil Wears Prada""","For the most part I found reading the book enjoyable and found this ""other"" world fascinating - although the Miranda stuff tends to get on your nerves. The geat disappointment came at the end - there's such a build up throughout the book, but it just drops the ball at the end, very disappointing. I hesitate to tell anyone to read this book - because of the frustrating ending."
3,WHO is the Devil??,"I'd give it more 2.5 stars....Andrea Sachs is fresh out of college and lands a ""dream job"" at RUNWAY magazine. The usual boss from hell story should follow....but Andrea's whiney, self important, do-gooder attitude had me disliking HER more than her boss, Miranda Priestly. I agree with others who bemoan the lack of beginning or end. Characters just disappear, and loose ends are left untied. This is an okay 'beach read', but I would borrow a copy or check out the library first."
3,Entertaining,"I thought this book was a fun read, very entertaining. It's a great beach book--doesn't require a lot of concentration or deep thought. It is very similar to The Nanny Diaries in tone--that sort of put upon I'm-above-all-this tone, but witty. It worked better in The Nanny Diaries because you could tell the main character really cared about Grayer, the child she was taking care of, whereas Andrea clearly doesn't give a hoot about fashion (really, why would you?) or anyone she works with, either. It made me really, really glad that I do not work in fashion. Everything is wrapped up a bit too neatly at the end, but it definitely holds your attention."
1,"Trying to read this boring , overated book","It is becoming painful. The title seems interesting, but the detailed writing about fashion is really a torture, no plot, just descriptions after descriptions about shallow peoples (anorexic models). I regret the purchase of this book, I am trying to make my wasted money valuable, but the reading is becoming a torture."
1,NOTHING ABOUT PRADA AND A LOT OF CELL PHONES PARANOIA,"HAVING WORKED IN NYC IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY FOR NEAR TWO DECADES I FOUND THIS BOOK BORING.THE CENTRAL CHARACTER AND NARRATOR IS A PATHETIC WANNABE IN A WORLD AS COMPETITIVE AND DEMANDING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME FASCINATING AS THE FASHION WORLD IS.A WORLD THAT THE CHARACTER ""AHN-DRE-AH,"" DOESN'T EVEN CARE FOR.IN REALITY ANY JOB IN NYC IS STRESSFUL, AND SPECIALLY FOR THE SPOIL CHARACTER OF THIS BOOK THAT IS LUCKY TO HAVE EXPERIENCE HER FIRST JOB IN SUCH A PRIVILEGE AND UNDESERVING POSITION.THE ONLY PORPOISE FOR MISS WEINBERGER IN THIS BAD WRITTEN BOOK IS TO TRASH MRS. WINTOUR.NOTHING ABOUT PRADA AND A LOT OF CELLULAR PHONE PARANOIA FOR A SMALL TOWN GIRL."
2,Too Much of the Same,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer who described the book as a drag because it felt like the same scenario was being replayed over and over throughout the book. It seems a bit implausible that someone would put up with so much mistreatment from their boss for a whole year simply to get a recommendation. If the main character had the charm, wit, or likability of Bridget Jones, this might have worked. But the main character is not especially endearing (in fact, she's fairly pathetic)and everyone in the novel is so vapid and bitchy, the story simply wears thin after awhile. I read most of it and then just couldn't take another miserable anecdote, so I skimmed through the last chapters and read the end so I could at least enjoy the final payback. I hope the movie inserts some sweetness, humor, and romance to balance the bitter. Otherwise, it will be a dreary 2 hour experience. This book will definitely hit the resell pile at my house."
3,"It's good, easy reading....but I liked the devil.","Well...the book was a good way to waste a few alone-time hours but I'm not crazy about it. It was...ok. But I have to admit, I kind of liked the devil, because Andrea's (main character) continuous uh, um, uh stuttering and wimpiness made me want to scream at her too. But a fun read."
2,"I'd like to be different, but...","As much as I would like to stand up for Lauren and say, ""No, this was a well written novel!"" I just can't. The simple reason is that it isn't. It was initially entertaining but so incredibly inconsistent throughout. Andrea's character had no depth, you did not find yourself feeling for her or becoming connected to her in any way. Anyone who tolerates this type of abuse, in my opinion, deserves it. I am not quite sure how Ms. Weisberger wanted you to feel about her main character. I did finish the book but I feel bad for the author because I think she does show promise but may not be able to recoup from this poor attempt at a novel (one that was highly anticipated as well!)"
5,A Great Read for the Beach or the Pool!,"This is a great book if you read it for what is---fun reading for the beach and similar venues, plus some insight into the fashion world. I read this book on a raft while sipping a frozen margarita, and it really fit the bill. Deep reading this book is not, but the story is highly entertaining. For those of you who live and read in saner parts of the country, Lauren Weisberger really hit the mark on this one. It was fun mentally comparing notes as I read and laughed through the book. I have known other Mirandas (female and male) in other fields, and in a past life lived in a ritzy DC suburb where some of them also lived. There really ARE Mirandas who make these types of demands on their help without any regard or kindness in return, folks. I once knew a local Miranda who liked to gather her wannabes around her for regular worship while she rattled her jewels and burned out a new nanny every year... This is great catty entertainment!"
4,A great fun read!,"This book was very entertaining and very addictive - I finished it in less than 48 hours on my vacation! Of course it's not life changing literature but it's a very fun read and I highly recommend it, especially if you love fashion and gossip. Don't give up if you get frustrated with Andrea's actions and her crazy boss, the ending makes it all worth it! This is a great light and fun read, ENJOY!"
4,Great Read,"The Devil Wears Prada was an absolute great read. I found it quite funny and interesting before discovering the author, Lauren Weisburger's story behind it. It's nice to see young women telling stories from their point of view in the workforce. It sure made me remember how hard I worked not even five years ago. While reading the book, I also began to look at hard working ""invisible"" people differently and with more appreciation. If just a few people are effected this way by reading the book, publishing it was totally worth it. There was something in the book for everyone from Fashionistas to the ambitious to the naive to relate to and enjoy. Thumbs up Lauren! There should be a sequal, do include more traveling for Andrea when you write it."
1,this is probably one of the dumbest books I've ever read,"It's books like these that perpetuate stereotypes that young, upper middle class new york women must necessarily behave in a snobby, pretentious, racist, self-important, ungrateful, and (at least in Lauren Weisberger's case) untalented hack wannabe writer manner.Weisberger is apparently from the school that dictates that being sarcastic, ""jaded,"" and unpleasant to strangers and muttering mean comments under one's breath automatically makes a person witty and ""in.""Note to Weisberger -- you are SO out."
1,"More boring than...well, anything!","The plot is lame, the characters are unlikable, the writing is mediocre. This was one of the most disappointing books I have encountered in a long time. Despite the great title, the main character is a pathetic, spineless wretch whose life's ambition seems to be being a doormat for a vain, self-absorbed, nasty woman executive who treats her miserably. I forced myself to get halfway through the book hoping that it would improve ... it didn't!0 out of 5 stars - although Amazon doesn't list 0 as a choice!"
1,What a waste of time and money,"Characters were poorly developed. Read through the whole novel, the only thing you get is Andy had a very very bad job because of her nasty boss. There are no character building around Andy, her boss Miranda, her boyfriend Alex, Lily... From cover to back, it goes on and on complaining about the job, but nothing more! If you skip 200 pages of the book, guess what, you are not missing any plot, not a bit!"
1,What is all the fuss about?,"I read this book for my book club -- I may even (tragically) have been the person who recommended it. It had been billed to me by others as being funny. Ha! It is not only not funny, it is tedious, trite, and annoying. The narrator makes ridiculous assertions too often to list them here (she's going to get a job at The New Yorker after having been somebody's personal assistant for a year? Huh? Maybe if she was Si Newhouse's personal assistant and the job was somebody at The New Yorker's personal assistant.) Do not waste your time on this. It is just plain stupid."
1,Waste of time!,"Reading this book was a complete waste of a day. Not only do I have no tolerance for weak characters, especially women, I have no patience for such ridiculous scenarios. There is no way anyone with any self respect would put up with such a ridiculous boss for any length of time. The only reason I finished this book is that it was a book club selection. I should have read the last chapter and saved myself the pain of reading the entire thing."
3,A light read,"It's a quick, light read. I have also known a boss similar to Miranda, thankGod I wasn't her assistant though!There are some funny parts & the occasional one-liner, but all in all, it wears a little thin. The main character is incredibly naive for most of the book & we're expected to believe she suddenly smarts up in the rushed ending. One would think that she'd develop a survival instinct over the course of the book. The characters are a little 2-dimensional and the main character doesn't develop over the course of the book (except at the very, very end).It's a great book to read on the plane, I certainly wouldn't pay the full hardcover price for it."
3,Average but entertaining,"This is a quick and light read. The descriptions of living in New York city are particularly entertaining. This being said, I'm glad that the book ended when it did because it was starting to get a bit irritating and I couldn't bear reading anymore about ""the devil."""
4,A page turner!,"I started reading The Devil Wears Prada in the bookstore and before I knew it ten pages had passed. That's always a sign of a book worth purchasing, so I did. It was, overall, an enjoyable piece of fiction.Sure, like some of the other reviewers, I would have liked to have seen other sides of Miranda's and the ""Runway"" characters, but ah well, the book is still at it's best when she and the ""Runway"" characters--in every sense of the word--appear. These women often times seem not human in their villain ways, though it's still a fun read. Otherwise, chunks of the story are ""told"" rather than ""shown"", but there is still enough to keep the pages turning and the reader wanting to see what Andy has to endure next.Bottome line, The Devil Wears Prada is a bestseller for good reason and is worth the read."
1,Wait for the Movie,"Great title and promising premise, but the writing is dull-normal at best and you learn all there is to know about the story from reading the jacket. No insights await inside the covers. And the grammar is the worst I've ever seen in published writing... which is particularly astonishing since the narrator/heroine claims to be a graduate of Brown with a burning desire to write for The New Yorker. Hard to believe the book had an editor. Not only was reading it a waste of time, it was seriously annoying."
3,Ending disappoints.,"The book makes for good light reading but all the while I kept thinking that the ""devil"" in this story would eventually get her come-uppance for being such a dreadful example of a human being, or at the very least, the protagonist Andrea would really give this woman a mouthful and tell her what everyone else is thinking but have never said to her. So the ending was a bit lacklustre, it left me disappointed."
3,Fun Read But Not An Award Winner,"I had heard alot about this book and finally broke down and read it. There were definitely times in the book where I laughed (the part about all the Christmas gifts was funny), but I agree that the ending was predictable and the writing was choppy at times. The boss' antics were enough to make you want to jump into the book and strangle her, but the narrator of the story could be a little annoying at times. I suggest the book for an easy and enjoyable read, but it is not as good as the Jane Green novels."
1,So excruciatingly DULL,"Wow. This was an unbelievably dull book, which is something of a mortal sin for a gossipy tell-all. The ""excesses"" perpetrated by ""Miranda"" are, frankly, not all that shocking. Not for that circle. Nor is she sui generis in being a poor boss and an unpleasant waste of skin as a person. But I've read wickedly hilarious accounts of far more pedestrian events, persons and narratives...it's not so much the topic at hand in TDWP that induces dreariness but the execrable writing. The book should NEVER have been published. It might have been a great Rolling Stone or Harper's article, with more aggressive editing and tighter focus. Perhaps, as Weisberger writes in her dedication, we should blame the editor for taking out all the really funny stuff. Ultimately, though, it's the author's fault for sucking so damned hard."
3,a light read,"I have worked for the male version of ""Miranda"" for several years and I can assure anyone who is doubtful that these stories are not exaggerated. Because I can relate, I enjoyed reading this book to a point. However, I think the book could have been half the size - I skimmed through it towards the later part. There's just so many nightmare work stories a person can read, especially if you live it everyday. I also think the narrator displayed too much of a ""I am too good for this job"" attitude. Most of us feel this way, but we put up with it because we need to pay the bills (and don't have $36,000 worth of designer clothes to sell) and these Miranda types offer salaries that you cannot get in most other administrative jobs. In some ways, the narrator had an attitude that was almost as ignorant as Miranda's."
5,Not The Nanny Diaries,"This book is very similiar, but not the same.I think that we should give her a break. This book is hilarious and I think, exactly what it is supposed to be. A fun, easy read. Go with it."
4,Good summer reading,"I enjoyed the book & thought it provided an interesting perspective of a world I had never even wondered about. Last year I really enjoyed The Nanny Diaries, which this is repeatedly compared to, and I enjoyed both. They both shed light on the world of the over-privaleged and come from the perspective of a young, well balanced employee. Beyond that they don't share the same message so it isn't a repeat read!"
1,Need to stop the racial stereotypes...,"The book would have been okay except for some of the racial stereotypes. Why did the author feel the need to make it clear when the character was speaking with an african-american, yet never distinguished when the characters were speaking to other races. Were we to assume all the other characters were white???"
4,Devilishly Funny,"I've read through the reviews and to be honest, I'm a bit shocked there are so many negative comments out there. This isn't intended to be the next novel of the day, it's a light hearted, funny story. Give the author some credit for creating a cute, laugh out loud story. I had to shake my head at some of the crazy demands that Miranda had for Andrea. If you like cute and funny, pick this up, if not, leave it on the shelf."
2,Nanny does fashion world,"The book is essentially The Nanny Diaries set in a fashion magazine - evil, unreasonable boss; excesses of filthy rich lifestyle in Manhattan, etc., etc."
1,My 14-yr old neice can write a better written book than this,"I don't know what my expectations were, since this is Lauren Weisberger's first novel, but it seems as though if you have an interesting life experience to tell, no matter HOW poorly you write, someone will publish it...I was very disappointed in Ms. Weisberger's writing ability, and I agree with another reviewer who blamed her editors...if this is all it takes to get published, then I have a best-seller ready to go! I hope her writing improves if she decides to write another novel. My 14 year old neice could have written a better novel than this."
1,Du-oh,"I bought this book because of the great title and after finishing it(that was torture). I just had to say Du-Oh. I think I just wasted money on something that I should have just borrowed from the library. If this were a movie, it would be Gigli or Glitter. Too bad amazon has no zero star or garbage icon rating because this novel rates a zero star or at least two garbage icons."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"While the subject matter promised interesting reading, the writing is horrid. I am not even halfway through and I cannot bring myself to continue. I am amazed writing of such poor caliber is published. Heaven help The New Yorker if Weisberger ever gets her ""dream job!"""
5,The devil wears Prada,"It is really nice. We can feel New York environment and vibes as tough we were there. It is also possible to get to know the city very nicely. If you have been there before, it is a pleasent experience to remember the city.EXCELLENT!!!"
2,Boring...so boring,"I tried really hard to be interested in this book but i quit. I just can not do it. The main character is a bland judgemental person. The plot lines are old, Andrea is so busy she did not pay enough attention to her boyfriend and best friend...so what? She is not a very likeable character. Miranda Priestley, outrageous as she is, was entertaining to read (which is a reason I gave 2 starts instead of 1), Andrea needs to develop some personality. I heard they are going to make a movie out of this, and glenn close might play Miranda, that would be hilarious. So go to the library and borrow the book, it is not worth buying!"
1,Don't believe the hype! A total waste of time.,"I agree with the person who said that if you liked the Nanny Diaries, you'd like this book as well. Meaning, if you like vapid, ""girls who should know better"" characters in ridiculous New York situations, this is the book for you. Watch Ally McBeal? You'd like this book. Do we really need to read about yet another smart, capable young woman who falls prey to the allure of ""City Life"" and does stupid things in order to get by? I expected a trashy, Vogue-ish dishy read about Jimmy Choos, Manolos, and Prada -- and a character I could care about for at least a few days. But if you actually enjoy plot or character development, pass this one up."
2,Not Worth Reading...,"The writing in this book makes it painfully clear why the author endured the abuse described just for the chance her demanding boss would pull some strings for her and help the author get a job as a writer--she has no talent. Anyone who actually can write would have enough confidence in her ability to get a job based on merit rather than enduring the humiliation described in the novel. The characters are undeveloped and Andrea comes across as a whining, self-centered, insecure brat who expects everyone around her to feel sorry for her but who has no interest in anyone but herself.If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may find the stories about Miranda mildly entertaining; however, if your time is precious to you, this is not a worthwhile book."
2,Boring,"I agree with so many of the earlier reviews. This novel was frustrating. The synopsis offered a good read. Sadly, the writer failed. The writing is horrible. There is little attention to detail and detail that was uneeded. I didn't care about any of the characters; they were entirely one-dimensional. Totally predictable."
2,Ho Hum,"The only thing that gives this two stars is the descriptive humor...If anyone thinks this is good at all, please please read The Best of Everything written in the 50's and a movie that is still availiable made in 1959....this was what all of us in high school and college in the 50's dreamed of....all of the glamour of the big city. The most wonderful cast even on the dark side. Suzy was the model of the day. We all know about Joan Crawford and what a job she did. The book was great, but maybe this is where this author really got her ideas, but enough of the whinning and absolutely not a fragment of story line...."
3,Wasn't all that good.,"Ok, the movie probably was good, but the book was not. It's cool to get free designer clothes but to be mistreated in the most undignified and disrespectful way, I mean c'mon, the writer should have given us the satisfaction of Andrea saying more than just ""%&#@ you, Miranda"" in the end, in front of the world's best dressed people. To be so humiliated like that for almost a year, that is all an angry person could manage to say? The book did not fulfill the hype."
3,entertaining enough,"I definitely liked the movie better. It was shorter, sweeter, and had an overall better plot. The book was a good enough summer read, but the movie is more enjoyable."
2,Blugh,"Forcing myself to finish this book for a bookclub was a huge waste of time. I felt that it was poorly written and had a very weak storyline (if having one at all). While I chuckled at a few one liners, the rest of the comments, conversations, asides, and thoughts of the main character felt forced and unnatural. Then in mid-story, the author tries to bring on a serious tone in describing the drinking problems of the roommate and issues with our main character's relationships. All of this seemed quite false, however, in such a materialistic, shallow story about the fashion world. This story may be suitable for drunken sorority girls or fashion expert wannabes, but for the rest of us, I would not recommend it."
1,NOT HILARIOUS,"Worst book ever. This author tries to make the main character seem witty, funny and charming, but none of those goals is accomplished. The humour is too over the top and just does not cut it. The main character is completely unlovable, much like Carrie Bradshaw in 'Sex and the City'. This book was on a New York Times Best Sellers list? please."
1,The best thing about this book is the cover art...,"The only reason this book was published is clearly because the author worked for a high-profile member of the publishing industry who has made a few enemies in her day. There is no other plausible excuse for the hype surrounding this endlessly whiny diatribe of a recent college graduate. Everything is overly dramatized by the main character, and everyone is an affronting menace. The main character lacks any complexity as she is continuously martyred by The Real World. Even the antics of the evil boss suffer due to the incessant ""I am a such a victim!"" tone of the book, a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting read that would have probably been addressed by peers in a beginner level writer's workshop. The cover art is fantastic, though."
4,Fun Summer Read! On par with Nanny Diaries,"I devoured Devil in one day. Despite the book being too long (some parts seemed to drag on), I actually enjoyed Weisberger's debut and feel that it was on par with The Nanny Diaries. Even though the ending was predictable, it is more interesting than the ending of ""Diaries""- which I think was a major flaw in that book. Overall a fun summer read."
2,Unnecessary,"I liked the basis to which this book was written. However, if you are going to make the main character appear to be a naive girl who is not akin to the bustling world of the fashion industry - one who has a dream of becoming a big time writer for a newspaper, why does she have to swear all the time. I simply thought all of the swearing was unnecessary and detracted from how good the book could have been."
2,The Devil could wear solid gold (...) and still not redeem this weak read,I fully expected this book to be fabulous but I turned out to be fabulously dissapointed with the perils of Auhn-dreas bummer job working or Miranda. It takes me about 4 chapters to start asking myself why Andrea does'nt just march up to her nasty boss and tell her just what to do with her Prada. The supporting characters are non realistic and the book gave me an overall complex about how unglam. eating at Bennihana's is. I expected so much more from this novel but really all it manages to do is label sling excessively and make me wonder why anyone in the world would sell their free designer goods just to make a chunk of change. Keep those Louis Vuittons girl! Really dissapointing.
4,Good read,I enjoyed reading this book although at times it was hard to think of a person being so crude. That's the point right!? Was very surprised when I watched the movie (after) and found them drastically different.
5,The Devil Wears Prada:Inside the World of Fashion Journalism,"This book details the plight of a young journalist with a ""banana republic heavy"" wardrobe through the world of couture and designer labels. The crazy antics of her overzealous and mean boss are hillarious, while her own reactions are so bitter and cynical they make you laugh. In the hopes that this personal assistant job will put her on the fast-track to success, she loses sight of her real priorities. Her final decision revolves around a common theme: career or personal life? You can relate to many of her troubles and struggles, and cheer her on as she climbs the mountains built by her boss. This is a funny book you won't want to put down!"
2,Title seemed appealing...,Yet another book about bad jobs and overpriced shoes.Has creativity taken a new turn since sex and the city? It seems that now anyone can be an author as long as they can spell Jimmy Choo...
2,Diet Cola,"The reviewer who compared this book to diet coke couldn't have been more correct. It was an okay read. Enjoyable, but didn't have any real substance. This was not a book that entices a person to ignore the outside world and keep reading. Instead, it was the type of book you read for a few minutes each night before going to sleep. I didn't experience my usual ""mourning"" period after reading it that I do other books and was able to jump into a more intense book right after. It actually left me craving a much more intense read.My boyfriend and I even started refering to this book as diet coke. I'm not sure he actually remembers it's real title.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it on a superficial level and that I wouldn't contemplate reading it again in the future... but I don't see that happening. My mother, who read it as well, was much more critical of it than I was... which is the opposite of what normally happens."
5,Lighthearted and funny,"I couldn't put down this book until I finished! Whoever wrote on a previous review that Lauren Weisberger's book was like a written version of a Sex and the City episode is so right!I won't discuss if it is fiction or the writer's biography because it is really beyond the point. The book is very funny, lighthearted and the fashion world is depicted so well. Besides, the plot is well constructed and the core issue of the book is interesting: how much are you willing to sacrifice in order to get your dreams (the dream job in this case)?And having had my share of hidious bosses with obnoxious requests, I really laughed with Andy's struggles in order to fulfill them all."
4,Jarden Home Brands Kerr 12 PK,These are the same as one can purchase in stores. They work with the same efficient method. Price is high when consider that shipping is not included.

3,"Light and insubstantial, but fun","Every way I try to sum up this book seems trite and silly: 'zany heroine' and 'impossibly laughable situations' and 'disastrous romances'. But, other than the bit about the police detective (without giving too much away I'm not sure I can say more) seeming incredibly forced and unrealistic, the story was actually pretty entertaining. And it did keep you wondering right up until the end. It's the kind of book you don't want to put down because you just have to know!Not for those who like hard-boiled serious mysteries, but any fan of cozies or the Plum series will probably find this entertaining. The slight character problems aside, it was a fun, fluffy read.My one criticism is a person one (a bit of a crusade, I guess) about the 'math is hard' attitude. I guess I'm just so very tired of women who can't do math, though at least this time it's shown biting her in the rear. It was too easy and stereotypical as a plot device, and perpetuates a sad misconception."
4,Tarzan of the Apes,"The shipment was very fast. I appreciated receiving the book so quickly. It was rated as in very good condition, however, I think the rating should have been fair or good."
5,Tarzan of the apes,It has been a wonderful experience reading again this adventurous Novel. It.s just as exciting as it was years ago.----I encourage everyone to venture into it once again!
3,Interesting old standard.,After all these years this is still an interesting and enjoyable read. I still enjoyed the other and premise of the book.
4,"Children's Book, But Fun Just the Same","I read this book before assighning it to my children. It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written. In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.). As an adult, I would believe that people are smart enough to weed out the literary license taken by this piece of fiction; and discuss the book with their children as to it's story, characters, and intent.I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did."
2,"pay careful attention to ""adapted""","I have been hunting feverishly for a while for an original text for Tarzan. This isn't it. It does clearly state on the cover that it is adapted. Just be aware that if you are looking for an unaltered version, skip on by this edition. It is geared toward young adult readers, not the avid Tarzan fan."
1,Beware- long term use breaks plastic case!,"Despite occasional malfunctions of the power switch (I needed to repeatedly actuate it before it engaged again) I was quite satisfied with the mower for ca. 1 year. I used the mower ca. every two weeks in summer, mowing 0.35 acres of hilly terrain. After a year I noticed a crack in the plastic case, which in my opinion is under-dimensioned for a motor that powerful. I believe the product has not been thoroughly tested, otherwise it would have become obvious that such a thin casing would be torn apart during long-term use. The crack extended, and now the entire rear part of the mower which includes the rear wheels has fallen off! I can only dispose of it in the garbage can, thanks to the customer support and lack of repair options (plastic welding, anyone?)."
1,"Crappy design for grassbox, bad reflection on whole product",The grassbox won't snap together and in the attempt I scratched my arms to bits. I just couldn't believe that it really wouldn't go together and then I came back and saw other reviews to this effect. Boy am I sorry I bought this. I've never written a review before (good or bad) but I am so shocked at the poor design I had to share my opinion.
3,Grass Catcher Difficult to Impossible to Assemble,"I purchased the mower with a cord, which comes with an unassembled 2 piece plastic grass catcher that I have been unable to snap together because of the flexing of the two pieces. So right now I have just a mulching mower."
3,grass catcher impossible to assemble,"i have used this mower for 3 mos now, and its a good mower for the price. the problem is the grass catcher is next to impossible to install on the mower. it has plastic clips that are supposed to snap together and i still haven't gotten the two halves to snap together yet. it's a wasted feature. i would recommend this mower on its cutting ability, but is grass catching is a feature you consider important pass on this mower."
3,can't wait!!!!!!,"well, i have read WAITING FOR NICK......and i identified with nick's longing fora home.........which he certainly found in the Stanilaskis circle!!!!!! i'd like to read more about this family....the way Nora describes thm, you'll forget they're just fictional characters!!!!! it's like being welcomed warmly into a new family!!!!!!!"
1,Nice try...,"Perhaps the worst thought out book aimed at attacking American school systems. Not only does Nussbaum contradict herself on several occasions, but her plans for all forms of educations are not only unrealistic, but absolutely absurd. Perhaps if she hadn't tried to pad her own views with the curriculum of schools and thoughts of every ancient philosopher, her views could have been presented more clearly. An overall failure...I'm not sure how it got published..."
5,Excellent value,I was very pleased to find these batteries at a great price. I use them to power my Pelican 2360 for duty use and seem to last a bit longer that duracell or engergizers. Rayovac Ultra line is the only brand a major oil refinery selected as its vendor. The contractor pack helps keep them in secure and in order.
5,Interesting Read,The story takes place in the 1930's in the south west of Tibet. Frank Kingdon Ward has a knack for story telling and takes you on the journey with him. He describes in detail the type of plant he finds and also about the people and their culture that he encounters. You also learn a bit about Tibet's history. If you like exploration and adventure then you will enjoy this interesting book.
5,Right questions even when I don't agree with the answer.,"This books gives a very good coverage of what you need to think about in starting a Micro ISV and some possible answers.Where else will you QUICKER find out.a) How match it costs to get an icon designed?b) How to get your very own Microsoft Buddy?c) How to get LOTs of close to ""free"" software from Microsoft to help with starting your ISV? (I have seen a system admin person spends HOURS on the phone to Microsoft and then fail to get the same information.)d) How to manger a project team of one person (you!)?On one will agree with all of Bob Walsh's answers; however it is a lot more important that you ask yourselves the questions and be able to justify your answer to your self. That is what this book helps you do."
3,Reasonably good--for a propaganda film,Reasonably good--for a propaganda film. . .The strength of the movie is in the character of the mayor of Kolberg though his hysterical daughter and caricaturized son nearly undo his acting.Not at all as bad as i would have expected from Goebel.
3,Not quite finished...,"This book was a quick, interesting read, but the author didn't quite finish writing the book. There were several concurrent story lines...all interesting. An incompetant conman, a not-ready-for-prime-time thug, an adoptee searching for a birth parent...You just knew you were reading spokes on a wheel that were all going to come together at the center. And that was pretty much the case, BUT...a few of the spokes kind of glanced off the side of the hub. Or maybe never quite made it to the center. And those that did come to the center got there a little too abrubtly. I still have a lot of 'wonder what happened to...' questions.The book was an entertaining Sunday afternoon read, but a forgettable story, once you put it down. Not earth-shattering, but still fun to read"
5,Prayer and Spiritual Warfare,"This was an excellent study, rather intense, thought provoking but definitely a spiritual growth tool. Hayford's studies are always excellent."
2,Tips over too easy,"I used this product only once.The day after I got it I bumped it and it tipped over, rolled off the counter, and the thermos shattered:( Too bad it tipped over so easy because it looked great, kept the liquid hot, and poured great (at least for the only time I got to use it.)"
4,Great mini-shelf system for the buck..,Sound quality is excellent for they price you pay. Main unit was deeper than anticipated though --review the dimensions -- (rendering placement on certain shelves impossible). The CD trays are thin and flimsy so it may not last many years. The remote control comes in very handy. USB audio capability a plus.
5,Original Music from an Original Time!,"I heard about the Fact that ZE records was coming back & kept my Eyes & ears open. Well They are & This is one of the New reissue collections. A Great Double CD of Great tracks from an underappreciated Time in NYC music history. Were these artists So far ahead of their times? Were people just lazy & stupid? Can Music be Great & Not Commericial! Yes, Yes & Yes!Great selections & great Versions of some of the best known Songs of the roster. Only one complaint: Picking The Waitresses' ""I know what Boys like"" as their selection showed either uninspired commercialism or just laziness. Its on So many Other collections. This Group Has So many songs that would have fit nicer within the other artist's great songs. Oh well, Pick up this Wonderful 2 CD set, Fans of trully Great music Won't be disappointed!"
2,Chart Cherry-Picking,"Once again, we have a book where most of the strategies do not stand up to historical testing. There is little coverage of specific entry or exit points, and what's the point if trading strategies do not stand up to scientific testing? The book is full of typographical errors. For $150, some proof-reading could have been done."
5,Good Advanced Strategies,"Good strategies, all conceptually correct. Great for the novice trader looking to step up to the next level. Bill"

3,cordless,"Can note finish blowing off my drive, front walkway, back deck and rear walkway before the battery runs out. :-("
1,"Got two, both only last about 5min each","Pretty unhappy with this product, they don't seem to hold much of a charge at all. I have a very small yard and with two I can't even finish what I need to do. ~5min each is unacceptable. Going back to amazon as a return, I guess I'll have to look into another product."
1,No Power,I have both the Worx trimmer and blower. The battery for each of them worked for about 20 minutes a charge the first month or so then they both only work less than 10 minutes after a charge. I complained to Worx and they sent me another battery but it does no better. I was told by Worx to recondition the battery by discharging completely and recharging 4 times. That only bought me an extra few minutes. Bottom line: the battery does not work as advertised thus my POOR rating.
2,Not that happy,"I have had this worx for 3 years now and was hoping this new battery would work and last longer than the old ones i had originally purchased and so far I am not getting the results that I wanted from this new battery. I guess once this is done, I am going to get another weed wacker. Really sad that it did not work as I wanted it to."
5,Work Battery,"Battery was new the box, went on the charger and used the following day. Works on the line trimmer and hedge trimmer. Seller did a good job!"
4,work's 18 volt battery,this is a replacement battery. It seems to be as good or better than the one that will not hold charge that it is replacing
5,Invites viewers to observe in a different light,"Jim Woodring's charcoal drawings are images that come from his interest in hidden worlds and lucid art - and SEEING THINGS gathers some of the most intriguing, arranging them in sections by topic: Visible World, Lazy Robinson, Frogs and Color. 'Color' by far seems the most exciting, dramatizing the drawings and providing eye-catching involvement in the symbolism of the unseen - while the black and white charcoal drawings might appeal most to artists who find color distracting. With its blends of surrealism and irony, SEEING THINGS invites viewers to observe in a different light.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,"What i wanted, but doesn't fit my radio","I got this for my ""Boss 612UA MP3-Compatible Digital Media AM/FM Receiver"" which i also got on Amazon. And after my friend and i spent an hour and a half figuring how to take my car apart to get the radio out in 30 degree weather, we went to attach the radio to this installation housing, and it didn't fit. so then we had to put my car back together and im still trying to find a housing that fits the radio. i found this all very annoying and frustrating because on the box for the radio it specifies what size of this to get and this is the one i chose and it doesnt fit! i wasn't sure weather i should write a bad review for this or the radio and i decided on this because i havent used the radio yet so i dont know how well it works and the box said to get this size so thats what i did... and it didn't fit."
1,Just plain BAD,"I purchased this exact model. Never again. I had problems from the beginning. It worked ok for a while, then started making noises. Eventually, it stopped working altogether. Total drive failure. Techsupport is impossible. Dead links for tech or customer service. Waiting on the phone for 40 minutes only to be disconnected. I finally got an RMA to retrun the product. I paid $30 for fedex shipment, only to recieve the product, unfixed a week and a half later. No explanation. No reply. No paperwork. And still no satisfaction or reply from the company. Stay away.. stay very far away"
1,Does not work with Vista SP1,This product is not recognized as being installed. Installed both the Sabrent and Syba drivers... and nothing. Even had the card replaced and still nothing. Simply was not detected by the system.
3,Far from ideal...,"I felt this book fell into the trap that many teaching books fall into - it assumes that the reader is at the same level as the author.Don't get me wrong, it was a *very* useful book, but it could have been a lot clearer about many of the key issues.For a beginner - don't buy this book. For an ""advanced beginner"", do =D"
3,Sat. Receiver,The receiver was what I wanted...one that would control 2 TVs. The problem was the software in the receiver would not upgrade. I had to call Dish and have them send a replacement.
5,Very good and complete score!,"The score was in very good condition and was a complete score, no missing pages!"
2,I know David personally,"The auther of the book failed to do one important thing, talk to and get to know David Camm. I am not a family member or long time friend. I became friends with Dave after his conviction because I am from this community and know that justice was not served. Authers of these ""true crime"" books should label there work fiction."
4,Great Book,Sad story with so many still unanswered questions. Hopefully justice will prevail and the horrible person who done this will be prosecuted.
2,John Glatt's One Deadly Night,"While the story line in this book is compelling, the syntax and excessive overuse of the word ""as"" is annoying and breaks the continuity of the story.In many places, Glatt repeats the same statements, often within only one or two pages. Additionally, the author has a poor grasp of punctuation rules. His inability to use commas appropriately negatively affects the flow of the story. The book could have used the assistance of a good editor.The story, about a man accused of murdering his wife and children, is gripping. The author does a fairly decent job of writing objectively and keeping the reader interested in the outcome--in spite of the poor writing style.For those who are able to ignore the grammar (incorrect use of plurals and possessives) and the constant use of ""as,"" the book will probably be a satisfying read.For those who are aware of the rules of grammar: buy a different author's account. Being an editor, this book virtually drove me insane."
2,Terribly disappointing,"The Neverending Story has always been one of my favorite books since I was young, and was really excited to read something else by Michael Ende. However, I found the book indredibly disappointing in comparison to the richness of Ende's imagination and character development in the Neverending Story. The plot falls flat, the conversation's boring and there's an overwhelming myopic sense of Christian self-righteousness that I found terribly disturbing. Maybe it's just the translation, but it doesn't feel like the same writer could've possibly done this at all."
2,"Exciting finale, little else.","I saw this film in the theatre on a Chow yun fat film festival. I found the film very amateureshly written. I know action films suspend belief, but this was ridiculous (a woman gets shot in the head, but dosen't die for about 7 minutes, chow recieves over 30 bullet hits in the filnale, but survives.) The story itself was intriguing, but the gun battles were ver outlandish, and out of place (shing fui on's demise is particularly laughable). I can take many stupid violent films of the eighties (AMerican"" Lethal Weapon, HK: Tiger on beat), but this one goes too far. It should have stuck with it's story, and not tried try solely to live up to the better tomorrow body count. Danny Lee has a particularly good cameo."
3,Good for sleep,"Good information, but laid out in a boring text book style. Probably more suited to fisherman than divers. Pictures in one chapter with description and information in another chapter. Most of the pictures are of dead fish laying on the dock rather than in the water."
4,December Band Vol 1,This CD is great. I heard a track on Australian radio and thought the best way to buy this CD was to go straight to Amazon.com in USA where the CD was produced.Great jazz music
5,Atlas of the Holocaust,"Very interesting book, especially valuable as a research tool for a new book in progress, plus one in a finished state but in review for fact checking."
5,Must buy for Jazz learners!,"IF you love Larry Carlton, you must love Joe Pass. After all, he is the ultimate jazz guitar man who taught Larry when he was a teenager. The title ""Joe Pass Jazz Lines"" is what it is, Jazz Lines. Don't expect much dialogue from his previous instructionals. He sits down and he starts playing, phrase by pharse. There are tons of music theory that he does not explain. But if you have some music theory at hand, these ideas can really come in handy. A small study booklet with notes, no tabs, is provided so you can practice along. Again, Joe's DVDs are all choked full of inspiration and ideas."
5,Awesome lounge music,"I love this album, great for lounging around. Or, you could also dance to it (I do it)."
3,"great idea, poor execution","I agree with Rick: great idea, poor execution. Various moral and social systems have long tried to codify and explain away through religious and other naratives what is only natural to us. Kudos to Mark Hauser for bringing our innate ""moral organ"" to broad attention.His writing however is another matter. I suggest, read his introductory chapter ""What Is Wrong?"" and then cherry-pick from the rest of the book as much of the following material is highly repetitive. This is topic waiting to be tackled again by another, stronger writer."
4,It works!,"The seem to have stopped making this, which upsets me; when I find a product that works I want to always be able to buy it."
1,don't buy this,"The only way this would work well is if you're already good at finding studs. There a very little magnet that will attach when over a metal piece of the wall, such as a nail or screw. And it doesn't always give you a solid hold. Basicly a fridge magnet would do the same thing."
3,Works OK but not spectacular - Good Value,"I have used multiple ultrasonic stud finders with very mixed results. I live in an older house, and sometimes finding a stud is quite a challenge. When I saw this product, I was hopeful that it would be a good solution. Finding a stud with this product requires a lot of sweeping back and forth, to find a nail. I was hoping for something more reliable, but this is NOT it. When you do finally find a nail, you have to guess about where the nail sits in relation to the center of the stud, so you are still left with a crap shoot."
4,Competition Hurdle,Met expectations. Matched the hurdles we currently own. It was easy to order the product and it was delivered to us in a very timely manner. No damage and was exactly what we wanted for a good price.
5,Excellent Customer Service,I was very surprised when I received the DVD I had purchased in such a timely manner. The product was packaged well and included a note inside with contact information and a nice message. One does not experience such personalized service often. I was very impressed!
2,This season is no better!,"This season is no better. Then buy it and watch it, I recommend better to wait a while and buy it cheaper, not worth $ 40 today."
5,GG ROCKS!!!,I love gossip girl. Its one of the best showes EVER. It really drags you in if you can get into all the drama. Its got everything you need in a show!
5,HAPPY,i love this show.every season gets better and better and the price is unbeatable.i got it 2 days after i placed my order.
4,An excellent short history of Scotland,"I read this book just before traveling to Scotland (the lowlands, there isn't much in it about the highlands) and found it to be an excellent preparation. I was able to recognize the various castles, cathedrals, abbeys that we saw and knew something about where and how they fit into Scottish history. I was much better able to enjoy the trip as it wasn't quite so new and overwhelming. Lang appears not to have too much of an axe to grind, but he does have some antipathy to John Knox, whom he clearly regards as an occasionally dishonest and troublesome rebel who not only upended the established Roman Catholic church and the monarchy, but destroyed a great deal of beautiful art and architecture into the bargain."
3,"A Short History, Thank Goodness!",I found this book long on lists of names and places but short on analysis and story. I'm looking for a book that provides an overview with detailed coverage of the most significant events.
3,Father Christmas,Nice but a disappointment as the grumpy charm of the original has been editted out and replaced with a sanitized version conforming to preceived American tastes.
1,"A childhood classic, ruined!","For whatever reason someone decided to re-dub the original Mel Smith voice over with someone who doesn't sound grumpy, doesn't say bloomin' and swaps in words like vacation for holiday. Absolute nonsense. Seek out the original online."
4,Smashing,"I noticed this book on the front table at my favorite London bookstore, Hatchards, years ago. Years later I bought it at my local library and only, just now, read it.What a rollicking story involving Tony and Laura Churt, their art and Martin Clay and his wife Kate and daughter Tilda. At first a drama between the four primary personalities, an art history fueled detective story and ultimately a cautionary tale that ends with the thud of the brokenness that results from an obsession laced scam by Martin to sell one of Tony's art pieces (an alleged long lost Dutch Master) before Tony realizes its value. But then Tony has his own hidden agenda as well. And so we see the consequences of this obsession and the cost that this has on personal relationships.Worth the read."
2,Fascinating Premise Mired In Unabsorbing History,"I was fascinated by the theme of this book: What lengths will a man go to possess something that he covets? In this case, the object of desire is a painting which the narrator of the tale is convinced is the work of Bruegel, and he is prepared to lie, cheat, and jeopardize his marriage to obtain it. Although I laughed out loud at the narrator's efforts to rationalize despicable conduct, my enjoyment of the story was diminished by (what I deemed) the excessive descriptions of the political and religious forces in the Netherlands in the 16th century that shaped Bruegel's work. It is this detail which, although likely appealing to a reader with a keen interest in art history, significantly reduced the pleasure I derived when reading this novel."
2,Who cares?,I found the plot predictable; the characters unlovable; and the academic digressions ill-constructed.
1,Could not force myself to finish,I knew when this was picked by my book club that I would not enjoy it. I knew as I was reading the first 20 pages that I would not enjoy it. At 208 pages I decided to stop reading it. There are plenty of other reviews that discuss the flaws of this book so I won't repeat them.
2,"Liked the art history, hated the characters","I'm not a trained art historian, but the only part of this book that I enjoyed was the investigation of the painting. I completely missed the supposed humor of the novel - I think because I didn't find a single likeable quality in any of the characters. This book got a great review in the local paper & was a disappointment. It's on it's way to the used book store."
2,not impressed.,"sorry. this series in my opinion has gone way south. the last 'back to mine' that really got me was the dave seaman mix. this album turned out for me to be a real let down. the mix sounds like something i would here from some chump wanna-be. ....sorry to any hard core rollo/sister bliss fans, but i guess you can tell i'm not one of you."
1,Not worth spending money for it,You bye it because you think it's varios Reggaetoneros and it's just females dancing. It went straight to the garbage did not want to spend money on postage again.
3,"Heartfelt story, light read, lacks depth","This was a heartfelt story of a mensch who was dissatisfied with the lack of spirituality in bland liberal universalist culture in which he was raised. Eventually, he found true joy in Jewish orthodoxy. However, if you're pondering deep metaphysical issues, you'll find assertions here, but not deep abstract notions of different ""isms"" and why they are true or not. I was also uncomfortable with the assertion that Jewish assimilation caused the Holocaust."
2,Not up to my expectations,"The beginning is good, but the last 200+ pages seem very forced an formulaic. I finished the book because I had started it, but I didn't really want to. The story seemed to be heading in a predictable direction and I was disappointed at the end that I had wasted several hours of my life on this book. I love some of her other books like the Glass Lake and Firefly Summer, but this one didn't do it for me. I don't want to spoil the book by giving out details, but as usual the main woman is trod upon in some way and just sits there and takes it."
4,Like your favourite old sweater,"ECHOES was my first exposure to Maeve Binchy, and I was not disappointed. It is the timeworn tale of the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who wins the love of the wealthy boy. But it doesn't necessarily end happily ever after, and for that it's a step above your run-of-the-mill romance novel.Binchy's enchanting depiction of Ireland in the `50s and `60s and her loving characterizations warmly send the reader into that time and place. It was a treat for me every evening to come home from working in the corporate frenzy of the new millennium to return to that simpler time. Nothing too terribly shocking or powerful, not a whole lot to contemplate when you reach the end, just a welcome respite for a few hundred pages.If, as many reviewers here have suggested, ECHOES is not Maeve Binchy's best work, then I find myself very fortunate to be able to work my way through her catalog."
2,small type,"I have been unable to read this book, because the type is so small and dim. I am surprised at the quality., as I have come to expect more from Amazon Products."
4,Echoes - a Maeve Binchy Classic,"Another really enjoyable book from this author, who never fails to please. Her inate ability to draw together the many characters and their individual stories, then weave them into a truly believable story is an art in itself and no-one does it better than Ms Binchy. The characters from this story are rounded and believable, from the town doctor, his haughty wife and medical student son, to Clare, the shopkeeper's daughter, who is determined to ""study"" herself into a better situation, to the hard-working schoolteacher, who guides Clare through her school years and beyond, This group and all the other characters, who move through the story, make for a very interesting read"
5,Second Time Around,I loved this book so much the first time I read it -- probably 10 years ago - that I bought it to read again electronically. Rest in Peace Maeve Binchy! We will miss your wonderful books.
2,I ususually LOVE anything by Maeve Binchy...,"This book had an underdeveloped plot and was very disapointing to me! I love Maeve Binchy but I'm glad I didn't read this book before reading the Copper Beach, the Glass Lake, and Evening Class, which were all wonderful, or I never would have read another book by her. The characters start out so promising, and then their personalities become completely unpredictable towards the end. I think the plot wasn't well thought out for this novel, because the ending is tragic and severe, comes suddenly and really doesn't make a lot of sense. I recommend people read The Glass Lake, which is one of my favorites, and don't waste your time on this one."
2,Not one of Binchy's better novels,"Binchy happens to be my favorite author but this novel was truly disappointing.Yes,it had it's moments but overall it's was not very pleasing.I would'nt recommend this as a novel by binchy to read first.It would discourage you to read others which are mostly very good.Instead I would go with Tara Road,Circle of Friends,Evening Class or my fav-The Glass Lake.It was uneventful until nearly the end.Binchy is known for a slow beginning but Echoes just never seemed to get very good."
2,tough to get into,"I have read many Binchy novels and have always enjoyed them. ""Light a penny candle"" being my favorite. However, Echoes"" was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to take forever to develop the characters and therefore it was difficult to stay with book."
3,Don't Review this Book!!!,"Oh my god!! Don't review this book or you may get fired! Ahhh!!This book is so paranoid it will make you feel crazy. This book is like a conspiracy theory for offices, which is mildly entertaining, except for the fact that I work in the office.. and they might be reading this.. shhhh..All in all, I think this book would be informative to people who have not had fatherly advice or instruction on conformity and how to act appropriate in an office. Otherwise it's a rehash of annoying but helpful parental advice."
3,What you always suspected,"Cynthia Shapiro does a great job of revealing what -- deep in your heart -- you always knew. Your company doesn't care, no matter what they say. But hey, that's okay. Shapiro is going to arm you with great strategies to work around HR to get what you want out of the job. Sometimes cynical, frequently helpful, always truthful, Corporate Confidential is a must read for anyone caught in the belly of the corporate beast."
4,"Great Book, Unrealistic Ending","Year of Wonders is the story of a small English village invaded by the Plague in 1665 and 1666. The villagers quarantine themselves in order to stop the Plague from spreading to surrounding places. Told from the perspective of Anna, a young widowed maid for the rector and his wife, the story follows the village from the first case of the Plague until the infection and two thirds of the population are gone.This book captivated me from the very beginning. The fact that it's loosely based on a true story is a big reason that I found it so interesting. Brooks made you feel what it would be like to be there and to be one of those people. I felt their fear, their sadness, and their grief. My one complaint about the book, and the reason I didn't give it five stars, is the ending. I felt it was unrealistic and it seemed tacked on almost as an afterthought."
3,Predictable,"Year of Wonders was ok. It was incredibly predictable. I would call it very light historical fiction. Parts of it were good, but I was left wondering more about the real Plague Village servant instead of this trumped up fluffy character, Anna, who just happens to ""blossom"" into this superwoman heroine. Oh, please. For example, this woman was illiterate and within a few years she's reading and writing English and then understanding Latin in addition to holding two jobs, housework, managing a flock of sheep and raising two babies?!? Maybe they didn't need sleep back then or had more than 24 hours in a day. Oh wait...let's not forget nursing the plague victims. And don't get me started on the ending..... I won't spoil it, but it felt like it was the ending to a completely different novel with completely different characters. In conclusion, this is a good book to bring on vacation - an easy read with little substance."
2,story that had to be told . . .,But the pace was too slow . . . the story was filled almost entirely with unlikable characters.
1,A Huge Disappointment!!!!,"This wasn't a novel written to enlighten us about the Plague. It was written to ingrain us with the author's world views. What starts as an interesting book gradually denigrates as the plot becomes overburdened with Brooks' heroin, Anna, a ""Super Woman of the 17th Century"", while managing to present all male characters as hopelessly weak and flawed. The ending is pathetic. I couldn't be more disappointed!"
4,"Painful, but enlightening","This is the first book - fiction or non-fiction - that I have read about ""The Plague."" I knew that ""Year of Wonders"" would be dreadfully sad, but I embarked on the adventure anyway.The author, Geraldine Brooks, uses this historic backdrop to explore human nature and how people have used religion to be both more and less than they should be. When the people of this town are threatened by disease, death and isolation, their actions in the throes of terror is enthralling.Some become selfless. Some go crazy. Most re-interpret their religion. Some become mean, spiteful, violent. Many look for a scapegoat. A very few keep their heads, and just try to do the right thing.I will say that the ending seems to go beyond the reasonable story that leads up to it. However, this book is well worth the emotional angst and the eventual skepticism that it evokes."
2,Who wrote the last 50 pages of this book? - Spoiler,"Year of Wonders is a terrific book! Up until the last 50 pages or so, that is. Then, it seems like another author took over entirely. Brooks spent most of the book creating a wonderful tale that I believe really captured the time and the people in it. Then, wham! Of course the rector turns out to be a fraud. Because where could you ever find a pastor, let alone a Christian, (Anna at the end) whose faith endures? And ending up in Algeria and marrying a Muslim? Way too much to swallow."
4,A voyage to the 17th century,The book is very well written and referenced and provides insights on life during a dark period of our past. The story is capturing and moving. I would recommend it even though I found the end a little disappointing because totally out of line with the plot.
4,Keeps your attention,THe book was eloquently written. Brooks is masterful at weaving historical fact into a captivating story.
3,Years of wonder,"Overall, I did like this book. I find myself quite intrested in the years of the plague. So It was with intrest that I picked up a copy of The Years of Wonder. I found it to be a charater driven romanitic tale wrapped around a time of great diffuculty. I would have liked a little more detail about the Black Death in Eyam and a little less about the"" living"" survivors. Its a good twist on a romantic tale though."
5,A book of Wonder,"This is a work of extraordinary grace and subtlety. The reader is transported effortlessly into a world created by the writer which, for all its humanity and suffering, glides over the page like poetry, like a whisper. You share the unspeakable with her characters and yet you are uplifted by the optimism that survives the trauma.A transcendant work that is to be savored slowly."
5,Absolutely incredible.,"I rarely ever give a book five stars, as I feel that means it nears perfection, but this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's certainly the best book I've read in the past couple of years.Even though the protagonist is living in a completely different time and place, I felt as though I knew her. The character development is INCREDIBLE. I also am rarely ever moved to tears while reading, but this one tore me up in more than one spot. I found myself re-reading certain sections just to hear the words again, and I re-read them aloud. It's gorgeous writing. I'm glad I bought this one, instead of getting it from the library, because it's a keeper. I plan on re-reading it soon."
3,"A great start, a confusing ending","Beautiful language, great setting and history mark the beginning of this novel, and I enjoyed it till almost the end. The end, however, has confusing abrupt changes in one main character that could not have been anticipated; I felt hoodwinked by the author. Rushing the ""afterward"" into the final chapter, a huge chunk of life in a few pages disrupted the previously melodic flow of words. Started well, ended unsatisfactorily."
4,Unusual last chapter...,"There have been many great reviews written about this book, so there's not much more that I can add except to say, like some other reviewers, I loved this book up until the last chapter.It's not that the last chapter is necessarily ""bad"", it's just that it seems as if another book all of a sudden stepped in and took over. A four star recommendation from me only because of this."
4,An intriguing look into a difficult time,"I truly enjoyed this book, but would have loved a more substantial ending. Anna's Frith, the book's main character, was amazing. She was the backbone of a very desperate society. Ms. Brooks language transported me to another time and I felt as if I were really in the village, suffering right along with my neightbors. Her descriptions were stunning, her prose beautiful. It is highly unusual for a book to stir a desire to ""learn more"" through research, but this book did just that. It was truly a difficult time, compounded by ignorance. ""Year of Wonders"" is a heartfelt work, right up until the last chapter. Was it the publishers idea to stretch the book out? The ending did not flow with the rest of the book and left me wondering what happened to Anna. Bad ending and all, I would still recommend this book."
3,Don't read the afterward,"Good book. Interesting, decently written...until you get to the afterword. It completely ruined it for me. I like my historical fiction to be believable and that destroyed it. Read the book but pretend the last 15-20 pages aren't there."
3,Ending a disappointment,"The ending of the book was unpleasant and implausible. Characters who lived their faith through terrible times became unpleasant, selfish creatures, forsaking God once the plague was over. Overall history of the plague-infested town was interesting."
4,"Shorty, New Zealand","A good book, well written with a great storyline. I love reading books set in a time hundreds of years ago and found this book hard to put down. The characters were imaginative and I found the story quite tearful at times while laughing at others. It's got a bit of romance thrown in, witchcraft, religion and a mother's love for her children. I would rate it as a novel more for women, being written from a woman's perspective. An easy read, perhaps between two ""heavier"" novels."
2,Not what I expected,"I heard about this book on NPR, and when I read the reviews on Amazon, I was almost certain I'd really like it. Well, I was wrong. The book was more about soap opera scandals, petty behavior, and predictable ""trysts"" than it was about the sociological impact of self-imposed isolation during the plague. I must give credit to this author's publicist, because s/he has done a wonderful job spreading the word about a mediocre book."
1,Save your money!,"I am in total agreement with the person who wrote that this book is an imposition of the author's 21st century politically correct views on to the 17th century. There are so many things that happen to Anna and yet she is detached and lucid and clear about through it all, it is ridiculous. The ending is horrible, unrealistic, insane and pretty disappointing. Some of the apparently true historical incidents are interesting but forced into the story. I read the book because of the great reviews here on Amazon, but am going to be a little more discriminating on whose reviews I accept!"
3,"A fun read, but little more.","This book was quick, easy reading. I found the writing a little clunky, but it's a popular fiction book that's meant to sweep the reader quickly along, and it definitely did.Unfortunately, I felt that the author forced along the pace of the novel--she pulled trick after trick out of her hat, thrusting the characters into unbelievable situations and yanking them out by their chinny-chin-chins time and again. The final scenes--I won't ruin them for you--tested my credulity even further.Nonetheless, I think Brooks has a future as a writer, and has better things ahead of her. Year of Wonders is a quick, fun book, but little more. She can do better, and I'm sure she will."
2,A good book with a ridiculous ending,"I couldn't put this book down but then I got to the ending - the last 30 or 40 pages - and wanted to put it in the bin.What an idiotic ending! Seriously. Did the author's publisher call and say ""hey, that manuscript had better be on my desk by 5pm"" so she just photocopied a few pages of Twilight fan fiction and stuck them on the end?The ending is so unbelievable and ridiculous. I'm not going to spoil it for you but it's kind of like reading Huckleberry Finn and in the end Huck jumps on a train to Canada where he becomes a metaphysical poet and marries a princess. It's just that stupid.Apart from that, the book was fantastic. But the ending is so silly and disappointing I can't recommend it."
4,Book of Wonders,"I really enjoyed this book although when I read the Epilogue, I was in fact disappointed to learn that the author took liberties with the Pastor and his role in the book. It intrigued me enough to go back and learn more about the Plague. Worth the read - pretty quick and easy"
4,Great Reading Group Discussion Book,"I didn't know anything, really, about the plague until I read ""Year of Wonders"" by Geraldine Brooks. I certainly didn't think I wanted to. But I enjoy learning about things, especially historical events, different places and different times. This book is fascinating. It made for a GREAT book discussion for our reading group."
4,Surprisingly good,"I got this on my kindle because I have studied the dark ages and the time of plagues fore years, and was intrigued with the concept of a historical fiction book based in those dark and deadly times.I must admit I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised that we had a good story here."
2,Dear Boys,I was most disappointed with the quality of this DVD - it seems nothing more than a poor copy from an even poorer Video which is such a shame as I had eagerly awaited the transfer to DVD. The film is excellent but spoied by the poor quality of the DVD
4,A Second Chance At The Guy Who Got Away,"Anyone who ever loved and lost someone when he or she was in high school, will be drawn to this story. The author presents an interesting scenario. What if we had a second chance at having a relationship with our high school sweetheart? I liked the idea of love transcending time and getting a second chance with the one who got away, but I wish that Eric wasn't married. Since he is married, it would have been better for Maggie and Eric to just have a friendship. I liked the grief issues that Maggie was facing in the beginning of the story. I thought Ms. Spencer handled those scenes very well. If you like Ms. Spencer's other novels, this one won't leave you disappointed."
1,modern women beware!,"I can't believe how many good reviews this book received. It was an insult to any woman living in our modern world. Eric and Maggie have an affair and that is just fine. But Nancy is supposed to be evil because she is attractive, has a career she enjoys, and doesn't want to sit at home and pop out babies. And Katy is depicted as a brat because her mother uproots her entire life and she dares to say how she feels. Another thing...abortion, and Ms. Spencer's views on it...has no place in a romance novel. This novel did nothing but annoy me and turn me off of reading anything else written by Lyvyrle Spencer."
4,A charming read about two sisters.,"Jessie Ryder and Luz Ryder Benning are two sister that could pass as twins but couldn't be more different. Jessie has returned to Texas afte 16 years of travelling abroad leading the photo journalist lifestyle. Luz has remained in Texas marrying and raising four children; three boys that she bore herself and a daughter, Lila that Jessie gave up to her sister.When Lila was born prematurely it was never thought that she would survive. Jessie walked out of the hospital never to return once she secured her sister and brother-in-law into adopting her child. The adoption has remained a secret for the last sixteen years but Jessie is back and she wants to tell Lila the truth. Why now after 16 years of silence, why is Jessie back? Throw into the mix, a hunky widowed neighbour who has taken a liking to Jessie and you have got yourself a great novel about two sisters and finding true love."
5,true life,"this a was a great movie, although it may have been low budget(some would say cause it went straight to dvd) it was a great story. Although it was based on a true story, it was touching how Dee went through that whole ordeal. I loved how she kept it together for her children and also how she was holding it together for others that were in the same situation as her. Great Great story, a must watch by all."
2,Interlinear Greek-English New Testament,The print is so light most of it is unreadable for me. The same volume is available on-line to use for free.
4,December Band VOL 1,"After hearing a track or two on local Australian radio, I went straight to Amazon.com to buy this CD as it was produced in USA. It is a great production, clear and well mastered seeing it was an originally made in 1965."
2,Not worth the money.,"This was required reading for a course I took and I found it to be the biggest waste of time and money thus far of all the books I have had to purchase for school. It has a few nice stories about some well known chefs, but it doesn't have a lot of useful information in my opinion."
3,Looks great but I mistook the title,"The thoughts and tips on how to become a professional chef are insightful and well done. Unfortunately this was a snap purchase and I didn't read up on the full content of the book. Based on the title and some cursory reviews I thought the material would assist in becoming a ""chef"" at home, which is not the primary purpose of the book. It's clearly meant to assist those interested in becoming professional chefs."
4,Needed for college,I am starting college today and although I have not read the book fully yet I have opened it and looked inside it was on my textbook list and seems like it could be very helpful. Good book for college students or anyone in the industry really
3,Eh,"Decent game, decent expansion. Good for fans of tactical shooters. Way better than Swat4, improvements over Swat3, tremendously better than those horrible vegas games. The last of the good R6 games."
4,As solidly interesting as the cable program it is based on,"Brian Lamb would be a national treasure if he had only shepherded C-SPAN into existence. But he also brings us Booknotes -- a wonderful and distinctly understated tour through the inner workings of the most fascinating authors of our time -- and this book admirably captures the tenor and content of the cable program on which it is based.Each author is covered (only once as a rule) in two to three pages which may touch upon influences, motives, work style and the writing experience. Each chapter begins with an introductory paragraph by Mr. Lamb, but otherwise the show's creator and moderator is not injected into the material, which is presented as straight text rather than in an interview format.The short chapters make it a wonderful read in all circumstances, the material is engrossing, and one finds many suggestions for further reading here. Well done."
3,"good direction, solid scares, horrible acting","This was the only movie directed by Dario Argento that my local Blockbuster carried, and even though it was in a censored R-rated cut, I must say I liked it. At its best, ""Trauma"" invoked late-70's/early-80's John Carpenter, and was easily one of the scarier films I'd seen in a while. However, the acting (by a predominately American cast including Frederic Forrest, Piper Laurie, and Brad Dourif) was mostly over-the-top and horrible. And now, after seeing such Argento masterpieces as ""Deep Red,"" ""Suspiria,"" and ""Tenebrae,"" ""Trauma"" really pales in comparison but is still good. It might be more easily accessible to someone who hasn't been exposed to Argento before, but for hardcore fans it's only a lukewarm offering."
2,All the ingredients of an Argento film BUT...,"Argento seems to be able to make GREAT horror as POOR ones. With a plot he already used a couple of times and filmed like he did also a couple of times, Dario Argento offers his daughter, not a bad actress at all, in one of his average work. It's no his worst movie but it's not fantastic either. The Hitchcock theme sounds sometimes like a very low budget music score, a pity! For me, not the revelation of Dario Argento's Art...This film could have been released decades ago, it's more like he didn't evolve at all and he simply makes the same recipe again and again. For ARGENTO fans only : You will find the mark of the master in this."
4,The book was gripping,I enjoyed this book so much. Dawn's was a very strong girl. Even when her life was torn apart and her family split-up she managed to keep it together. In many parts of the story I could feel for Dawn. I finished the book in one day.
1,Dawn,"I know that I have read this book once before. I tried to read it again recently, and I could not get through it. I made it through the first few chapters, and I just found it impossible to continue on. This one will be going on my yard sale."
1,This series is just awful.,"I love the real VC Andrews series, but this one was very dull, predictable if you've read the other series, and unbelievable. I couldn't fall in love with my brother like that ever. This book would be ok if you've never read the Heaven series or the Flowers in the Attic series.Sadly this series gets worse. I picked up the whole lot of them on Ebay, and by the fourth book, I just put it down halfway through. The fourth book of the Dawn series is literally a copy cat of the fourth one in the Casteel series.I agree with others, Dawn is conceited, whiny and just plain stupid. The only part I liked in this one was when she was sent to the Meadows. That to me was halfway original. And it just sounded interesting to live without power or running water. As everything was said in this book, I kept finding myself saying ""What's so bad about that?? Get over it and grow up!!""Now, the book Heaven. That's a good read. This Dawn book is written by the ghost writer, and it shows."
4,Great Book - but a little predictable,I read this book in about 4 days(school days). It's very entertaining and addictive. The secret about Dawn is kinda obvious but there were some surprises throughout the story. In my opinion the story went rather quickly. I am looking forward to reading the sequel A.S.A.P
1,Overpriced!,"$11.99 for a digital copy of a book first published around 1990 is ridiculous! Are they only handing out so many copies of this book for the Kindle? This is just another example of publishers being greedy, and preying on people's sense of nostalgia! To anyone out there thinking about buying this book for your Kindle, I say don't! Buy it used,then the publisher doesn't get a single penny."
2,Dawn wasn't original!!!,"I'm was so dissappointed in Dawn. I knew what was going to happen to Dawn from the first chapter on to the last. It was so predictable, i.e long lost rich family, incest, a grandmother who hates her, and a weak mother and father. Before it was ""revealed"" I knew she was dating her brother. I also knew her brother was going to still want to carry on their relationship. And the sister hating her, now that was a stretch of the imagination, NOT! This story was so predictable, maybe because the Andrews family won't let the writers stray to far V.C. Andrews original Flowers in the Attic series."
2,VHS quality,"Good movie. However, there are NO bonus features, as advertised. NO menu, NO extras, NO subtitles, nothing. Amazon should change the description of the product."
2,o.k. but nothing special,"Unimaginative, much hyped sci-fi/horror time filler about small group of survivors of a disease ravaged London, where the infected turn into rage-filled ""monsters"". Stark film making from talented director of ""Trainspotters"" and ""Shallow Grave"" has its moments, but as a whole it doesn't add up to much. Owes much from similar films such as ""The Omega Man"",""Dawn of the Dead"",and ""The Crazies"", just to name a few. Energetic(at times frantic)camera work, appropriate lighting, music and sound, take away from the fact that we've seen all this before. A few good scares here and there and some truly riveting scenes may keep some fans of the genre from cutting this one loose, but inconsistencies in the story, unintelligable dialouge and one-dimensional characterizations will quickly disappoint others. Clearly not for all tastes, but for those who are game, you'll have a good time."
2,"Horror no, Interesting no, waste of money Yes","I watched this movie thinking that it was really freakin scary. Wrong. Some parts may be somewhat startling but not at all scary. In this movie as the suspense would be building up there would be some stupid joke or they would cut to another, more quiet scene. The plot in this movie is not bad, and neither is the acting, but the actual story line was a waste of time. Along with poor cinematography and crummy picture quality made it a real waste. I can't believe i wasted money on seeing this movie."
1,Incredibly boring and lifeless,"A terrible, terrible movie. Honestly, the only thing this movie has going for it is the cool cover art. I admit the plot is kinda interesting, but the dull characters, unconvincing zombies (the ""Infected"") and utter lack of fright factor bury this movie. The only scary part is in the beginning, and it has NOTHING to do with zombies, or the movie. Its a random thing that happens. Overall, the storyline was hard to follow, the characters were dull and uninteresting, and it was basically one of those movies you watch just because you're interested to know how the director/writer decided to end this piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs, unless you're a rabid zombie/horror movie fan, in that case rent it nothing more."
1,A really terribly bad movie.,"Lousy premise, lousy acting, lousy filming techniques, lousy color and hues that didn't do anything to change the feeling of the movie. It wasn't scary, it wasn't thrilling. Tedious doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Was the director asleep? Did he just let the actors improvise all the scenes?"
1,Er...is there a point to this?,"I felt like the movie kept me entertained in the beginning, when it was all about the zombie-things and all. But there was that totally unnecessary shot of the main actor's nether regions. What was up with that? Anyway, I was mildly entertained through the whole beginning, but then all the sudden, the zombies weren't important anymore. What was important was that the two girls escaped being raped by the army guys. YEAH, RIGHT. We entirely shifted focus, and I found it terribly stupid. And the ending was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. It was a terrible disappointment when I had been wanting to see it for so long."
3,Buenisima Pelicula. Pero no en BluRay,"La vi en el por primera vez en el cine y fue una de las mejores en ese año. La compre en DVD y no decepciona para nada tenerla cada vez que se antoje verla. Pero no le di 4 0 5 estrellas por la versión en BluRay. Viendo las dos versiones en una HDTV me refiero al DVD y BluRay, la diferencia es muy poca o casi nada. Yo tengo como reproductor de DVD y BD a la consola PS3, y mejora mucho la versión en DVD pero esperaba mucho en BD. Mi HDTV es Bravia con 24p y 120Hz. Y con todas las configuraciones que intenté con la pantalla para mejorarla no estuvo al nivel de mis otras películas en BD. Dicho esto, me que quedo con la versión en DVD."
5,A postmodern masterpiece,Ok Mongo (aka Alice) from Borders - The obvious product placement in this film is clearly a representation of how our culture is so saturated with brands that you can't even escape them when the world is ending and corporate identity no longer means anything. The film is filmed on Mini DV and the branding only adds to the reality aspect of it (one of the many reasons its so scary). The characters are shallow - but it is danny boyle. and the acting is terrible - although it seems somehow deliberate in a mulholland drive kind of way. But what a film! They really don't make 'em like this anymore (except they just did by making this). At least worth seeing.
2,Not DVD worthy,"28 Days, a good attempt at a plot thats been done a million times. The movie begins to lag when the main character spends 20 minutes of the movie, (not literally) walking around the streets of London screaming ""Hello!"" Its a decent movie if you are into zombie movies, but it's not DVD worthy. I wouldn't pay to own it."
1,Awful BluRay,"Spending money for the Bluray version is very foolish. However much you like the movie, and I did like it, the Bluray is awful. Grainy, soft, loaded with halo artifacts from the transfer's effort to increase sharpness, and it's a disaster from start to finish. Buy the DVD if you must own it, but go cheap."
3,"Starts great, peters out, lame finish","The first 30 minutes are great storytelling as Jim awakens from his coma and grapples with a whole new world. The intro of Selena, Hannah, and her father are all well done.Once this team reaches the compound the story goes flat. I understand the idea of spinning a tale of survivalist compound, but the military characters are done in two dimensions, with many hoary stereotypes. They are portrayed as primitive frat boys, when a much darker, Darwinian turn of the script is called for here. Could you imagine if the commander had proposed it was their duty to start repopulating the earth...that would have been compelling.The ending is standard movie stuff found in any Hollywood action movie. So 28 Days Later peters out in a less than satisfying ending."
1,Extremely Poor Picture Quality,"As has been pointed out by some others this is NOT a BluRay disc that even comes close to anything approaching HD quality.On my 55"" HD it looked like an SD TV broadcast;This is an excellent movie but I wouldn't have wasted my money on this low quality BD if I had known how disappointing the image quality was going to be."
4,Very Enjoyable Horror Flick,"28 Days Later follows a man who wakes up in a hospital to find he is one of the few survivors left after a plague spread causing people to turn into zombie like creatures. It is definately a fun watch. I wouldn't say it's scary, but it is pretty suspensful and will provide a few jumps. I would say the creepiest aspects of the movie are how fast the infected move and how bloodthirsty they become. Only a handful survive and continue to do their best to stay that way.I would definately recommend 28 Days Later for a change of pace in the horror genre."
2,Was this supposed to be a zombie movie?,"Perhaps I have been spoiled on flicks like Dawn of the Dead, Dead Alive, and Evil Dead, which are all great zombie fare. I expected 28 Days Later to be of the same ilk; but it was a ""grave"" diaappointment. This movie played out more like a melodrama than a hardcore zombie flick. You wouldn't even know if the creatures were supposed to be zombies unless you had read the DVD cover. This movie was way to slow-paced and did not live up to the billing that the critics claimed. If you are a REAL zombie fan, don't get this trash."
2,Grossly Overrated,"I love zombie movies, and I dont know why it took me so long to see this one. The reviews hailed it as original and scary, so I was stoked. But, at the end, I was scratching my head wondering if I got the edited for tv version or something because it wasnt very scary. I made me jump a few times, but theres a difference between being scared and being startled. Plus, to call it original is a slap in the face to the zombie movies of the sixties and seventies. I mean, it was more intelligent than most horror movies, but what fan base are the filmmakers trying to appeal to? When I go to see a horror film, I expect either to be genuinely disturbed (The Ring, Blair Witch), or to laugh heartily at the cheesy villians and storyline (Freddy v. Jason). Either way, I expect a good time. However, with this one, I just felt disappointed. If you like zombie films, you wont like this one, guaranteed."
2,British BOMB!!!,"Horror buffs need to take ""28 Days Later"" into muchly needed inconsideration. This had to be the slowest moving horror flick on the planet. While this British box-office smash was commended for chills and thrills..it is truly a fiasco. It had two moments of terror...222 moments of predictable JELLO. I spent $20 on this DVD. It's worth maybe $5.99.The soundtrack completely sucks...the acting is average...and the editing is the highlight. Unfortunately, when you edit one bad scene to the next, you simply can't win.This British loser must have been made by someone who ventured through WW2. It has the nauseating military twist to it that simply doesn't fit today. Why is it the British always want to embellish their hatred for the Germans? Move on!!!! Get a life!!!! Make a horror film and get away from those silly military fatigues. This one is simply billed as a horror film. That's right...it is simply horrible!!! It gets a 2!!! And that's being nice."
1,Don't buy Blu Ray,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought this, The blu ray quality is worse than most dvd quality movies I've seen. I thought it was an issue with my TV but I tried on 3 different set ups and all looked horrible. Do not buy the blu ray version!!!!"
2,A Bad Imitation of Resident Evil !,"It was not good nor palatable.It's something to be disregarded.Watch the original ""Resident Evil"" instead."
1,Yes this is the scariest Horror movie of all time,"That is if you are scared of watching Scooby do, then you should definitely avoid this,Avoid this movie if you suffer from the following:-Faint HeartLoss of breathHallucinationsWeak StomachHigh Blood PressureLow Blood PressureGood TasteExpecting something GoodSuffer from disappointmentsHey get this was in the top 20 from 100 scariest moments. If you want to watch a real good movie then AVOID THIS (YOU'VE BEEN WARNED)"
1,28 days,"whoever decided to make a low budget movie and thought it would make alot of movie quick, was very correct....this movie was promoted to be, scarier than the ring. It dindt even come close. This movie sucked so much, i left the theatre and demanded my money back, before i got a hour in to the movie......i think the producer and director should never make a movie again.....if i could give this movie no stars on this review, i would give it negotive 10 stars...."
5,TOTALLY BRILLIANT! AWESOME!,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I ALREADY BOUGHT IT! THE THOUGHT OF A DISEASE WITH NO BOUNDARY'S, NO CURE. THIS IS A BONE CHILLING MOVIE WITH A TERRIBLE THOUGHT THAT PROBABLY HAUNTS ALL MINDS WHICH IS "" THIS CAN REALLY HAPPEN""THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. I DONT CALL THIS A HORROR. I CALL IT A EYE OPENER!A MUST BUY MOVIE-------------------28 DAYS LATER RULES ALL-------------------"
5,An amazingly scary film.,"Extremely well done, I think the ending was perfect. Don't think this is simply a zombie movie, that is all wrong, this is a film about the study of human nature and the evil that we can bring about and do to ourselves.The scariest part is during the film when you realize the 'real' monsters in this film are the soldiers who were supposed to save the three in the film. They end up being more monsterous and horrible than the bloody infected people chasing them. You are left wondering who would be the worst to end up with!Ending was great, shining a little hope on a terrible situation and letting you breathe a sigh of releif that our heros made it out of this mess alive.A great film, I highly recommend it."
1,"Unnecessarily on Blu-ray in ""Hi-Def"". Great movie though.","Buy the DVD for <$10. Your Blu-ray player will upscale the SD video so that it is indistinguishable from the Blu-ray. I'm sure they put this movie on Blu-ray because it was shot almost entirely with a digital camera. So, the transfer was quick. Unfortunately, the movie was shot with one of the early Canon X Series digital camcorders. So, the resolution for ""hi-def"" simply does not exist. They upscaled the SD digital image before putting it on the Blu-ray, but any Blu-ray player will upscale the DVD for you. BUY THE DVD. THIS IS A RIPOFF ON BLU-RAY."
4,Reinvents a Dying Genre,"This fresh film handles an overdone subject matter (zombies/infection/apocalypse) in a delicate and thoughtful way.Story and characters are king in this film, not only is it downright intensely scary, but the film takes some unexpected twists and turns that will leave you clinging to your seat while it is happening and thinking about morality and politics afterward.One of the best films of our generation!Rankings are out of 5Story: 4Character Development: 5Effects: 3 1/2Scare Factor: 4Camerawork: 3Overall: 4"
2,Rent it first.,"The ending killed this movie. I would have given it four stars if the ending had left a sour feeling in my stomach, but it didn't. The ""what if"" alternate ending is a little better, but, without giving anything away, the ending was just too happy. The first hour and a half of this movie were terrific, I was spellbound, but everything just fell apart in the last twenty minutes and the ending was just so typical. The ending was so bad that it reminded me of your average, run of the mill Hollywood horror movie. This brought to mind the bad ending of the novel ""Hannibal"" by Thomas Harris. I read 700 pages of pure bliss only to be totally let down in the last chapter. This is what 28 Days later did for me. I hope Danny Boyle's next movie is as good as ""Trainspotting."""
2,Night of the Living Dead remake,I thought that the movie could have been a lot better. The acting was somewhat to be desired but it did have a couple of shocking moments.It reminded me to much of night of the living dead with a little twist on the zombies.....rage..... I thought that Night of the Living dead was far better. God I hope they don't make a sequel to this movie.
3,its okay,when this movie came out it kept saying stuff in the commercials like scary as hell. i had really wanted to c the movie badly. but my parents wouldnt let me c it cause it had nudity(which they thought was girl not guy)but after awhile of begging they said ok. i was so happy but when the movie was over i was not happy. first off it is not scary. if ur a person that gets scared easily watch it but for me a real horror movie fan it was not scary at all. but i did like the story concept of this rage virus. i also liked that it was not a typical zombie like movie. it was pretty different. one thing the ending was stupid even with the alternate. but the blood and gore was alright although it could have gotton bloodyier. its not scary but the movie itself is good. but for me it sucked.
5,say you love indie filmmaking,"Boyle is a true filmmaker. On par with other new generation directors as Kassovitz, Refn and Besson he reinvented the European filmaking scene with his creative and imaginative aesthetics. He took a wrong turn and got lost for a moment inthe Hollywood burocratic persona exploitation but then decided to go back to his roots. He proved he is indie at heart and still is a talented visionary. Like all true film geeks he was probably raised on genre films such as cannibal, extreme and zombie movies. And to shoot a zombie movie was indeed his kept away secret for a long time. With digital revolutionizing the industry and the filmmaking mediun as a whole, he made this for the new generation of inspiring filmmakers so to realize how little it really takes to make your child dreams in filmmaking reality..."
4,Terrifying psychological thriller...,"Extremely terrifying psychological thriller with a basis not that far from reality. What if one day entire populations were wiped out by a highly contagious disease? Before anyone rolls their eyes at the pretext of the situation the movie is based on, consider Ebola, West Nile virus, etc. Could something like this really be that far from happening?The story begins with confusion as the protagonist tries to piece together what has happened over the last few weeks while he has been in a coma. Then from the non-stop thrills and scares of trying to escape from the ""infecteds"", to the highly intense conclusion of having to escape from a group even more sinister than those who are diseased, the viewer is kept of the edge of his or her seat.Fun for scares and thrills, but also thought-provoking in premise, this is one film that will grab hold of you and not let go until after the credits have rolled. See it today if think you can handle it..."
2,Too many stupid implausibilities...,"This movie wants to be great and could have been great. But it's almost as if two people were arguing when they wrote it: two very different people; a smart one and a not-so-smart one.There are just two many implausibilities unaccounted for.Such as: Why is it established that the infected monsters can eject infected material at a person, but then, later in the movie, you find a non-infected person standing right in front of an infected monster, taunting it, with no protection covering his face???And why, at the beginning, were the infected monkeys only encased in glass if what they were infected with was so drastically deadly???Unexplained stupidities of small detail abound in this movie and destroy it's believability for any thinking, questioning viewer."
2,The Brits can't make a good movie.,"This movie is very shallow. It has a good idea but not a good story line. The British tried to make a good movie but did not succeed. There is unnecessary nudity in the movie especially since the only show the guy naked. Unless you see this movie for free, don't waste your time or money."
3,Have we not seen this before?,This horror film looks like something out of the late 20th century of movies made that fit into that genre. Nothing really special here except that there is a lot more action than you would expect. It also seems to play out a lot more realistic than one would also expect.
3,The first 2/3s are great ... then,"This film started out wonderfully. The whole setup, mood, photography, etc. are excellent. The senses of impending doom, confusion, and loss are very palpable. Similar in some ways to The Omega Man, Last Man on Earth, Andromeda Strain, Night of the Living Dead ... and that's fine. In fact, even good - because it is very well done. The the last third at a miltary camp gets more unfocused, weirdly brutal and just strange. In fact the last third reminded me of a really bad horror film I had seen in the eighties. The film poses some great questions about morality, loyality, science ... but the last third, for me, really diminsihed what started out as a much more powerful film."
1,Oh my god!,Haven't seen such terrible movie for a long time!! The idea is old. You can pretty much predict what's gonna happen next which is terrible for an action movie. The worst is this kinda stories usually end up with no where to go and so does this movie. I believe those people who made the film still wandering around what they gonna do for the end during the hooting and that's why you can see the alternative endings in the DVD. I don't even what to see those endings because they will still lead NO WHERE! Bottom line: Don't waste your time.
4,Superfly's Review,This movie was average. This was one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a while but the movie had a weak plot. I'm thankful that it wasn't just running around and shooting the undead. What really blew me away were the alternate endings on the disc. I boosted my rating one star for the special features(Yay). To end my review own this DVD.
1,meaningless as hell,"""Scary as Hell"" is what the ads said. This is false advertising. The movie was not scary, probably because Danny Boyle fancied it to be more serious and weighty than your typical zombie flick. The problem is that it ends up being neither scary nor serious (when there's no real reason why it couldn't be both). The word that comes to mind is ""pretentious."" The movie's about 60 IQ points short of being able to pull off what it hopes to pull off. It's that same too-hip not-exactly-nihilistic pseudo-punk thing that's apparently the rage in England right now and is getting just way too tiresome. ""Trainspotting"" was great; this is BORING. It ISN'T meaningful or interesting, let alone exciting. What a waste of time - seriously. It's as profound as an eighth-grade creative-writing assignment."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I tried to watch this movie 8 times, and each time i had to shut it off because of how in possibly boring it was. So avoid buying it, watching it, or even thinking about doing any of those things."
1,Disapointing for 28 days after,What was this? It was cool for like 5 mins when he was the only one there walking around by himself. Very boring I couldnt't wait for it to be over.Every movie gets one star for trying.
1,Encoding quality,"If I had the movie on DVD and used an up converter, it would look better than this. Other than that, the movie is an excellent one.But don't dish out extra cash hoping to get something of 1080p quality."
2,"GREAT movie, poor quality","I really love this movie. I've seen it 1,000 times.But the quality of the Blu-ray was terrible. It sounded and looked bad. About the only time you can really tell its a blu-ray disk was at the end.You're better off just buying it on DVD."
3,picture quality,"28 Days Later is one of my favorite 'zombie movie'..When I first opening the packaging of this BluRay disc, I was wondering just how great would the picture quality be..But I was full of dissapointment when the film starts.. The picture quality is not much better than the DVD version..I can notice the digital compression at work.. especially on dark scenes..Then I remember that this movie was shot on Canon XL-1 MiniDV camera..No wonder.. :)And the sound,The dialogue level is so low so I had to pump up the volume of my AV Receiver (I'm using Onkyo TX-SR 606), but when it comes to the high-tense scenes, the music and sound FX is like blowing up my speaker set.. So I had to decrease the volume..It only have 5.1 DTS Master Audio for English language, no 5.1 Dolby Digital; so I can't watch with the 'Night Mode' on.."
3,"Could have been a GREAT movie, turned out OK","""28 Days Later"" could have been a great movie! Other reviews have covered the plot lines, so I'm not going to rehash them here. This movie had a lot going for it, including a strong plot, good actors, decent effects, and interesting twists. Where it fell down was in the editing and roundabout storytelling. In short, the movie was disjointed and just too long.Only recommended for fans of the genre. The squeal,28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition), is actual a better movie and worth seeing if you like this one."
4,Okay,This was an okay zombie movie. I honestly don't understand why everyone loves this film. Maybe it's because I'm not British...
2,28 days,the particular tape that I received is defective I should have returned it . May you guys can buy it back.
4,Thought Provoking Book,The title caught my attention..and I started reading..Good book to get a peek on a few up and coming possibilities in the Energy Industry. The author has a very good ability to write so that it connects well and keeps interest.I really enjoyed reading about the various possibilities that the coming change in the energy industry might entail.. Especially about various developments in the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen world.The author has done comprehensive research for this book which is admirable and there is a lot of journalism in the book.Overall a good book. Highly recommend it if you are curious about the energy industry trends
1,Poor Bag Boy service due to no parts,"My Bag Boy push cart handle broke in it's first months of use. They sent a whole new cart. I told them it looked like a design flaw.Months later, the handle broke again on the new cart the same way. This time I had to wait for a new handle - FOR TWO MONTHS AND ONE DAY. Their only offer to me? A Bag Boy shirt and a hat for my wait! They didn't even expedite the shipping as it took 5 days. It's unacceptable to have a cart this new be unusable for two months because they don't stock parts. And then they want me to wear their shirt and/or hat?? I should have gone with the Sun Mountain speed cart."
2,"Expensive, complicated, too fancy for me; Too much fish","More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV.Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats."
1,...JUST PLAIN OUT,i had win 98 and got a new comp. and is awalys crashing bugging down and it dont run that many games. Also the internet programs run slower
2,"horrible upgrade, only if you have too","many problems with this slow,os. either stay with windows 98 or upgrade to windows 2000 professional, much more stable, then all of them"
3,windows ME is 2 much like windows 98,When they made win ME they did not improve it that much over win 98 but it does run win 95 software that will not work on win 98. I have had win ME for a year now and I found out it does not work well with the ATI all in wonder. There are 2 fitures that I like system restore and pchelth fitures. System restore has help a lot becouse I have loaded software that has messed up my computer.
2,MILLENIUM EDITION COMES WITH ALL THE BUGS,"My dad just bought a 866Mhz PC with Windows Me on it. Within a month I had to reinstall Windows because the computer kept freezing up for no reason. Even now that I've reinstalled it, there are still problems. Certain programs freeze up. The computer doesn't always shutdown properly, causing me to turn it off manually. It takes two minutes from the time you fire the computer up before you can do anything. Of course, as Windows Me was part of a package, we didn't have to pay for it separately. But I wouldn't pay $5 for this ""Operating System."" I hope you know that the letters ME stand for: Malfunctioning Edition."
1,not worth 1 star,"the only reason i even put a star is because you have to. this is the worst attempt by microsoft to ""make life easier"" for the computer world. i have spent 2 days trying to install this software and now it cant locate my USB's. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! microsoft should have called this Windows NE (Nightmare Edition)."
1,Worst Windows Product Ever,"Unfortunately, ME came with a brand new computer that I purchased last year. I have had nothing but trouble with this operating system. It's terrible and full of bugs. I wish I could give it less that one star."
2,Think very hard before buying this book,"I find the good reviews given to this book very puzzling as it one of the most frustrating computer books I own. I dislike this book because it mainly cover the same ground as the online documentation, contains little high level explanation of concepts and is very poorly structured.A good computer book should cover high level concepts and supplement not rewrite the online documentation as think this one does.A good example of the poor structure is the Configuring Apache chapter the first few sections if this are: 1. Where Apache Looks for its Configuration 2. Per Directory Configuration 3. Conditional Configuration 4. How Apache Structures its Configuration I cannot understand why detail issues such as 2 and 3 are discussed before 4. I think the author and editor of this book should be ashamed of the structure and the enormous number of forward references.Unfortunately, I do not know of a better Apache book."
1,Useless book,"It is a completely useless book. The topics are described superficially. The examples are very simple, doesn't treat the really important and serious problems. The example configurations from the apache instalation are more helpfull than this book. Also a much better resource is on the Apache website, with many example configurations explained."
2,Over-priced and over-hyped,"I have to say, for the first time I feel like I have been duped by all the stars and the praises showered on this book by amazon customers. This book is good, but does not justify its exhorbitant price.Almost 70-80 % of the book is just an explanation of the httpd.conf file. (This is the configuration file for the server that controls almost all its functionality). If you read the documentation for apache (which is inside the config file!) carefully, you will see that this book just repeats the explanations in slightly modified text and larger font.To summarize, read the config file, drop the book, and save some money for Christmas."
3,Interesting & Promising Artist,"The one thing about this album that I rarely do with others, is that I listened to the lyrics the first time I listened to the song. Toby has a gifted way in phrasing her thoughts and feelings. This, and the fact that she has one of the most interesting voices from a young artist out today, is why Toby is so intriguing. ""Coming Back In"", ""Everyday"", and ""Devils and Angels"" forces you to listen and feel her emotions through the song. My particular favorite is ""Front Row"", where she is singing about someone who is flirting with her during a show. All songs included , Toby Lightman is an artist to watch and I hope that people will embrace her as I did."
2,What the. . .?,"I'm sorry, but I take issue with a previous review that says Toby Lightman's version of Real Love is much better than Mary J. Blige's. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING?!!! I do like Toby Lightman but I'm sorry, no one, and I MEAN NO ONE, can sing Real Love better than Mary. It was her first single and one of her signature songs. And not only that, if Mary hadn't given her permission to sing the song, Toby wouldn't have butchered it."
5,Care Bear Buddies/Cheer There and Everywhere DVD review,"I have every Care Bears dvd currently available and this ranks as one of the best. My two favorite episodes are on this DVD.Thesebeing True Hearts Big Trip( I always wanted her to get Oopsie as a mate)and Battle of the Band. My only regret is that theepisodes A Baby Bottle and Where's Lovalot are still not available. Still, this is an excellant collection of Care Bear episodes."
3,Flat . . .,"I love Chrissie . . . and looked for a copy of Lose In LA until I found the copy I am reviewing. The songs are great and I have learned to like the new with the old . . . so no problems there.You can just tell that she does not feel well. One of those things that nothing can be done about I suppose. With game face in tow . . . she does her best to pull it off . . . and to one whom loves the music, such as I, almost covers it. But it is hard to feel good, when you just don't. I give them, aka The Pretenders an A+ for the effort. The band did not let her down.If and when we get another DVD from them where she has the twnkle back in her eye, and not forced to fill a date . . . I will buy two of those coppies. This is still a must have for all Pretenders fans and not a bad introduction to the world of Chrissie Hynde . . . but those who know and love her, I think can see they are a bit flat."
4,Melancholy Bliss,"This fin de siecle poet is responsible for the popular phrases Gone With the Wind and Days of Wine and Roses. His work exhibits the blissful melancholy of one who knew he was not long for the world. (He died in 1900 at the age of 33.) His sadness is not bleak; it is accepting of life's ephemeral qualities. As such, there is ultimate hope."
4,This Book is now available in Hebrew in Israel,"This book is now available in Hebrew in Israel, so what your reviewer wrote is not up to date."
1,no subtitles,A lovely film with poor sound quality and no subtitles in english to make up for it. Bad buy.
5,Phil Keaggy's CD What a Day/Love Broke Thru,"I love these albums, especially What a Day. What's amazing is that my kids love them too. What a Day has such a fresh first love about it, filled with the wonder of someone who has found Jesus and is delighted and thrilled by Him."
5,Another rare find!,"This is two of the most important early Jesus music recordings. Phil Keaggy always delivers as far as professionalism, style, grace and truth in his lyrical style. I own most everything Keaggy has put out, save for the Glass Harp era, but I'm ruely blessed by his music"
2,It's only a replica of Hit & Run 1,"I believe Cooper wrote this book in response to the huge demand of his first book. The techniques discussed are nothing new. They are just a reflection of the ones in Hit & Run 1. I did enjoy Hit & Run 1, however."
3,Day Trading Method Setups,Jeff Cooper's book on Day trading. I've used a few of his method's and strategies in the past. Some strategies work and others do not.Most of his books he published in past are simular with various chart patterns that most of the experienced trader's already know.
4,leaves me wanting more,"This was a good book overall, but it has a hard time telling you where you are as far as the timeline of the war is concerned. It constantly jumps back and forth and it is at times hard to understand. Yet you have to give the author credit for amassingthis much information on one of the most secret organizations of our century. Should have been a thousand pages long, then it might have covered a few things more in depth. Also would like to see more pictures of the central people involved."
3,Good gift,"Good gift for the man in your life without having to break the bank! You must remind him to be gentle with it. I, personally, was hoping for something a bit more sturdy, but its still a great ring."
3,Mens sterling silver wedding band,"This ring is a nice ring. My husband liked it, however it is a little small, should have ordered 1/2 size bigger. But overall it is pretty."
5,Very pleased,"As soon as I saw this ring I ordered it without hesitation,it was shipped promptly and professionally,I will recommend it to anyone on a tight budget and want to look fabolous."
4,Mom loved it!,I haven't seen this item in person becuase I had it shipped direct to my Mom for Mother's day. But she loged it and everyone in the office had a laugh too.
3,Wizard of Oz Door Stop,"The Door Stop is very cute which is why I purchased it. However, my door seems to be too heavy and the door stop doesn't do well holding the door open. I'm disappointed in the product."
4,Small But Cute.,More practical as a paper work but does a fairly good job as a door stopper. I would get something a little bigger next time.
2,It is very tiny,"It can't stop my door since this is too small, but my door has a big gap. However, it is now become one of my display item instead."
5,Best Book I've Read In 20 Years!,"Andrew Carroll is a quiet genius, working seven long years to bring us this most amazing collection of American literature. I originally stumbled across the paperback edition of Andrew's book in an airport bookstore and minutes later, landed in a city three hours away! I've now purchased copies for all my friends since I've never encountered a more wonderful gift. Buy this book for your mate. Buy another copy for a friend. Buy another one for your parents and be sure to get a copy for yourself. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll never be the same again. Roy H. Williams"
5,"Clean, Good, and Uplifting",Such a good book! A great example of a sweet relationship between husband and wife. I loved it!
2,Pretty Boring,"I was looking forward to this book, unfortunately, I was disappointed. 1 dimensional characters and a forced plot made this not a very enjoyable read."
5,Great book,Nice book classic principles still true today amazing insight and detail in the intangible aspects of tennis never knew about him
3,Old but good,"This was quite an old book and everything changes even tennis, however there was still good advise in it. I would recommend it especially since it is free."
4,What a shame!,"I am sorry, but, I am unable to write a review on any of Eric Claptons' music VHS tapes. I live in Australia and his music videos are not available in PAL format. What a shame, such a brilliant guitarist scanning decades of everchanging style. Is there anyway I can purchase PAL formatted Eric Clapton VHS music videos?"
4,Vintage Clapton,"***vhs review***Even though almost all the songs were very familiar by the time I acquired this tape, it's such solid rock 'n roll and offers enough variations on a few favorites that I still enjoy playing this.""Tearing Us Apart"" with Clapton and Tina Turner is a highlight of this 62-minute concert, as is the venerable ""Crossroads"" as Eric puts a few new twists on it.""Layla"" is the second-to-last song on the tape and perhaps a fitting way to end viewing this, as the last song, ""Sunrise Of Your Love,"" is not anywhere as good as on Clapton's ""24 Nights"" concert.There is a rarity in here: a mistake made by Eric (with a ""sorry"" captioned on the screen) after he plays a sour note. Still, it's vintage Clapton and a very good one-hour concert."
4,Good Stuff!,"I've read several of Alice Hoffman's books, and have, for the most part, enjoyed them. BLACKBIRD HOUSE is one of my favorites, mainly because the story is weaved through centuries of history, but also because of the magical element that this mysterious Cape Cod cottage has. In short, it's a fun story to read and dream about a house that has inhabitated all types of fascinating people."
1,Horrible,"This bike pump is worth $13.99. The floor pedal broke as soon as I stepped on it, and it doesn't even reach 60psi. Do yourself a favor and invest in an expensive bike pump. Don't ""Reagan"" it like I did."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Used it twice on Schraeder valves, worked, but the performance was subpar. First time I tried to inflate my road bike with Presta valves, the adapter's threads immediately stripped (cheap plastic), next, the pin inside the pump's connector mashed down and now the entire pump is worthless. SHould've listened to my gut instead of my inner miser. DO NOT BUT THIS PUMP!"
2,Problems with presta valve,I could not get this pump to inflate my tires with presta valves. I used the cheap plastic adapter and a metal adapter from the bike shop. I did use it to pump up my kids bikes with schrader valves and it worked.
4,Irnore MBA egos,"Professor Manz is not afriad to be realistic in his assessment of business and personal achievements. The Power of Failure gives its readers the courage to stop hiding behind the security and prestige that comes with a hard earned job title or a fancy college degree, but instead, to take risks. Charles Manz's books are enjoyable and easy to read and applicable to those in any level of business or academia. This book teaches a valuable lesson that should be taught to anyone with an interest in achieving more happiness out of their careers."
4,Stop spinning your wheels,"Strongly recommend this book for anyone who feels he/she is constantly ""spinning their wheels"" and never getting out of life's occasional ""mud pit"".Most all of the chapters provide real-life examples of people (both famous and maybe not so famous) who've taken a disappointing situation or life obstacle and instead of playing the victim, have become the victor.The introduction contains excellent redefinitions of failure and success.This is a book I'll keep to reread when faced with another one of life's wheel-spinning challenges."
2,i thought better of him,"this album is typical fab. hiding behind rnb singers.i thought fab was gonna come out swingin because he said ny never left, how we gone bring it back. but he never represented any thing except rnb."
2,Worst Edition Ever!,"Oh, people! I'm about halfway through this book, and while the content is interesting, this edition of the book itself is an embarrassment. Every possible example of bad publishing is here, from no reference to the original date of publication (in fact, there is no copyright or publishing information at all), to misspellings, no or incorrect punctuation, wild margins and paragraph indentations, first letters of new sentences not it caps and the like. It makes it nearly unreadable. This is a topic that already lacks credibility, and when you publish a book that represents a classic piece of UFO literature in this amateurish form, it further degrades any evidence it has to offer. Bad, bad publishers!!!! Where are your proofreaders?! Where is your professional pride?!!!!! Amazon, my dependable friends, please take a look at this horror and remove this book from your offerings until the publishers clean up their act!"
5,The flying saucers are indeed real,"This is a very fine and persuasive treatment. Plenty of case studies, witnesses, and strange goings on for us all to consider."
4,4.25 stars- Brymer's best account of the concerto,"Of Brymer's three different versions of the Clarinet Concerto, his phrasing seems to be the best in this particular version. I think the timing of the slow movement at about 7:15 is going a little fast (I like versions to be at about the 8:00 minute mark), but it's not breathlessly fast in the least. This is a recording made in 1964 but it's not bad, just a little dry. If you just want a good Clarinet Concerto you really can't go wrong with this version.Also, the Clarinet Quintet is even better than the concerto and it's seems to have a little better sound quality too. If it's not the best recorded quintet available it's in the top 5 percent of all available recordings of that work. You definitely won't feel shortchanged if you buy this superb cd."
2,Something fishy in D'ni,"Firstly, I'm a computer animator and illustrator by trade. I had no technical problems with the game whatsoever; it ran like a champ, even on an out-of-the-box year-old Dell. However, that didn't mean that I liked the game overmuch. In a nutshell, its biggest weakness is that you explore 4 ages so that you can get online. That was the glaring point and purpose. There is no other reason. No story, no plot, no tension-building, no great sense of mystery and discovery - all the things that made the first three tremendously appealing. However, I understand the technical trade-offs Cyan needed to make to achieve this - but that was absolutely no excuse to sacrifice storyline. I am sadly disappointed with Uru. Where is my story! Weak, weak work, Cyan."
4,"Been there, D'ni that....","Now that I've finished the entire game, I like it better than I did while in the middle of playing it. The other reviewers are correct in stating that you will probably have to upgrade your video card in order to play. I did, plus added more memory. But the game worked fine after that. My biggest complaint with Uru is that, unlike the previous Myst games, finishing Uru depends a great deal upon your dexterity. There is jumping, walking jumps, running jumps...I confess, I once jumped off a cliff in sheer frustration! You figure out what you must do, and then spend ""hours"" trying to accomplish it! C'mon Cyan...we don't need busy work in our games!! I must say that the old thrill of snooping around, opening doors, going down hallways and reading other people's journals is alive and well. Just be prepared to ""panic link"" hundreds of times before you're through!"
1,Mac folk should exercise patience,"I've read all the reviews to date. While I'm just as frustrated as the next Mac guy (and I've been a Mac guy for 20 years) that there is no Mac version, from what I've read so far, I'm not convinced that I'm missing much.While a relative handful here give the game rave reviews, it appears that the rather narrow system requirements, along with the plethora of bugs and patches that typically plague Windoze systems regardless, add up to a less than exemplary experience, despite the advance hype. I'm certainly not going to invest in a new PeeCee just to play a $70 game. realMyst spoiled me.Let the Windoze people find the bugs - I mean, they're certainly used to it. Bill Gates has trained them well!By the time a kickin' Mac OS X version DOES become available, all those bugs and video card problems will be solved. It may be worth the wait."
5,To clarify,"To clarify anything, here is the deal. Im a beta tester for the game. I cant reveal anything but this is the lowdown... The game is incredible. You can play the solo game, and then you can subscribe to Uru Live, where you can travel to the D'ni city, meet other people, explore the ALWAYS EXPANDING ages, and even bring people to your own ages (your own game). The game blends the multiplayer aspect seamlessly into the game. The story goes WAY deeper (and makes alot of sense if you read the books), the levels are huge and beautiful, the puzzles are crazy, and the sound even better. Trust me, the sound rocks, its EAX. Also, you can play the game in 1st or third person. In 3rd you have a totally customizable avatar. I thought that being a 3D game might blow the whole look and feel. No way, it totally doesnt, you adjust quick.So, whether or not you want to do the online, the game still rocks, a must for any Myst fan. And despite what you may hear, you can use dial-up."
1,Requires more hardware than earlier Myst games,"Be absolutely certain that you have the hardware requirements for this game. Just because you've run Myst, Riven and Myst III, it doesn't mean you'll be able to play Uru. In fact you have to have one of only 2 video cards in order to play.Obviously, I'm disappointed. I love the Myst series, but Ubisoft should make it more clear that this game requires hardware above and beyond the earlier games."
4,I was certainly impressed...,"Let me preface this by saying I haven't played Myst, and I have only played a little of Riven.I have found URU to be a great game, the main problem being technical - it takes a big 3D graphics card, and there is an annoying lag between 'scenes' as the software is loaded, or whatever. Also, why are these games not able to be played with a joystick? I must be naive about something here.Now that the negative is out of the way, the positive is that this a great game with logical puzzles, not impossible, fantastic story, and fantastic areas to explore. There is no boredom in playing, and there are several factors which personalize the game. The graphics and sounds are the best I've ever seen in a PC game. I'm 37, this has been a great game to play in the evenings for relaxation...."
1,sorry,"This was a very poor showing of a show opening. I'm beginning yo wonder if Sam left his soul back in the mirror in Lawerence. If anything, this reminds of S6 of Buffy."
4,Fun Series,"What a fun series -- well shot, occasionally really scary and suspenseful, and funny, too. And beefcake for the ladies."
2,The worst season of the series,I like this show and think that the ideas are very original when it comes to depicting angels and other awesome things. I was in the infantry and I like cruel humor but this season crosses the line. One of the episodes shows a guy in a dentist chair not being able to lie and tells the dentist in great describtion how he was alone with his 7 year old daughter to rape her. WTF.... little things like this go on for the whole season. It crossed the line from entertainment to terrible.
4,Season Six of Supernatural,"The series is enjoyable with its combined humor and story lines. They have gotten creative in season six, which has helped the season as the story lines have gotten a bit far fetched. Apparently the intent of Eric Kripke was to do only 5 seasons. When they decided to do season six, the plots have really stretched to continue the show. Otherwise, it is still a fun show to watch with good ensemble of actors that play their parts well."
5,"Best sci-fi on TV right now, hands down","OK sometimes it runs out of ideas and has a dud episode, but not very often. And its stars have a fantastic chemistry. Funny, scary, often poignant and always entertaining."
5,Super for Supernatural,"Received the DVD's in great condition and on time for my son's Christmas present. He loved the sixth season, and can not wait for season seven."
3,Priced too high,I loved the fruit but it was very expensive. I had it when I was a child so it brought back memories but the cost would keep me from buying again.
4,Enjoyable book.,The reviews above pretty much say it all; I can't really add much to it. Mr. Ellison is indeed quite the character; making the story of Oracle's rise interesting to read.After reading the book; it's amazing that see that Oracle is the company it is today. Looks like Microsoft isn't the only less than ideal software company...
3,Attractive but not satisfying.,"This book is quite attractive for anyone who wanna know about Larry Ellison and Oracle history.But surely it will not satisfying them. Because this book is not too complete in telling about how Larry Ellison make oracle from a startup to become a giant like today. Beside that,this book is not give any picture at all.But cause there is not so many choice for one who want to know about Larry Ellison and Oracle history,this book could be the choice."
3,Great history of Oracle from many different perspectives,"Yes, I liked it. As an Oracle UK employee it filled in information on many of the myths that float around the company. It would make good reading for anyone who would like to get an insight into what drives Larry and how he views himself (and wants others to view him as well).The book is well written but compared to other biographies that I have read, does not capture and hold the reader. I found some of the chapters very hard going (particularly the discussions of in depth finance) but others held my attention well.The book is worth reading merely for the information that it contains from realtives, friends and even interviews with Larry."
2,A good review tool.,"This ""book"" is nothing of the sort. It is a collection of test questions and practice labs. The questions in general are not as specific as the questions on the real CCIE test. What this is, is a metric. The CD will test you and let you know where you need to study. The explanations of the answers are mostly good, but not in debth enough to stand as the only study tool you use. If you buy this book, use it as a measuring tool, not a study guide. By using this and studying Cisco's books, I passed the written on my first try. But then I also have 10 years of experience in the field.I haven't tried the practice labs yet, but will post again after I do."
2,"Not the worse, but not great either","This book, as with most of the CCIE books available today, has many errors. Even on the CD! For sure, this book will make you study harder to verify the author knows what he's talking about."
2,One can do without book. But it is easier with it.,"One buys the book because there' s very little stuff like that on the market (excercises, sample questions, sample quizes). They were, probably, the first to come up with that kind of material. Yes, it is superoverpriced, yes, it is way too simple compared to the real thing. But where do you get your gas if there is only one gas pump available? I bought it. I can not honestly say it did not help me to pass the written CCIE test. It did."
1,"Definitely NOT this book, I would recommend others....","I have read all the chapters and done the labs for this book. But I've found that this is far from the CCIE lab exam. This book does NOT give you solid groud of the complexity of the lab. And each chapter is not really well prepared and written. As the other people stated, this book is definitely TOO expensive $$$$$ for only 600 pages.Just passed my CCIE, and found that other books are FAR ""Better"" to get you with CCIE's hat.Ronald"
5,Wonderful little glue sticks,I finally needed to use these glue sticks after buying them a few weeks back. They are great! Way better than the few sticks that came with my cheap mini glue gun. They have less toxic melted plastic smell and flowed more easily than the generic sticks I had. The price was good so added it to another order for free shipping. I highly recommend these for crafts etc.I used it to glue some plastic parts together for an electronics project I was putting together. Worked great: strong join yet not too difficult to pick off after cooling. Just what I was hoping for.
3,good,This was a very useful thing but for the price I dont recommended. I could have bought 5 packages in the dollar store for it.
4,MINI Glue sticks,I thought these were all purpose little did I know they were too small for the hot glue gun I purchased of Amazon as well. I was able to give them to a friend. There is nothing wrong with the glue stick just be careful these are small around vs. normal glue sticks.
1,I don't get it,"Sorry, I don't get it. If you like depressing movies about pathetic, self-centered, losers who go through life inflicting pain on others and are unable to generate even a modicum of empathy for their fellow human beings then you'll love this flick...otherwise you'll do better just sitting in the closet for an hour and a half. WARNING: If you are at all suicidal don't watch this movie because it will surely push you over the edge. If this is the best that new-wave, independent art film makers can do then God help us all."
4,"""Good"" Rapist vs.""Bad"" Rapist","Mike Leigh is toying with sexual politics in this bleak film. I won't say that rape is ""glorified"" because it's often consensual encounters that suddenly become violent. That may make feminists even more angry...there's little definition of just what degree of violation occured and whether the loser women expected many sexual boundaries. Both men seemed likely to wind up dead or in prison by age 40. One is quite terrifying while the other (main character)is merely misguided. No happy endings here."
1,Garbage,"This movie ties with 'Breaking the Waves' as the worst movie I've ever seen. It is vile, vulgar and totally repulsive and boring."
5,Another Fun Coulter book,"I enjoyed this book; it has humor,a romance, a mystery, kids, pets and lots of family. It was a lighter read than Blue Skies (Hank Coulter's story). I didn't like it at all. I enjoyed that Zeke and Natalie meet and fall in love without all the sexual tension in other books. That storyline is so played out. Zeke was great with Natalie's kids and was just touching for him to especially reach out to Chad who was so troubled and helped him gain confidence in himself. Rosie of course was delightful. Yes, Natalie's sister was portrayed as a bit slutty but seems like she had a good heart. All in all it was a fun read and kept my interest to the end."
1,"Hmm, not like the others.","I normally absolutely love the Coulter series. Of the 8 there are, this one I couldn't even finish. I really didn't like the extra characters. I felt disgusted reading about overly slutty Valerie and drunk and dirty Grandpa. I thought Catherine painted a very low ""white trash"" picture of Natalie. Neither did I like the whole murder mystery angle. I know Catherine usually does the mystery thing very well, but the feel of the entire book was off. So, I guess I am one of very few people who did not like this book. ALL of the other ones have earned a place on my favorites list, and Catherine is still one of my favorites too. Was hoping for better, I guess."
3,Weak ending to what had been a very interesting series,"I bought this DVD set to finish out my collection of all 10 seasons and liked the picture/color quality about as much as anything in the season. The series may have gone on too long for it's own good, I think the writing really began slipping with the conclusion of the high school years (which season was that?). Someday I'll get around to watching this set, probably won't ever go Blu-ray unless it's really cheap and covers all 10 seasons.It's been months since I looked my set over but I think #10 even had the weakest set of extras of the series."
2,Bad disk?,"I'm on the second disk now, and the third episode does not play on my xbox 360, on my TV's DVD player it skips constantly, however, it does play on my PS3. Not really sure why, it is not the blue ray version so there is really no excuse for the dvd to only play on certain devices."
5,good show,"If you are into smallville or superman this is a must see, totally loved it though my husband was not as impressed as I was"
5,Cool Episode,"I think that the person who gave this episode a one star, does not appreciate the show as much as a true Smallville fan does. Every show has room for what I call ""fill in episodes"". These episodes are not the best, but to a true fan of the show, these episodes are still worthy for a five star. The finale will be the best, so keep on watching and enjoying Smallville."
1,Frustrating,"I'm really getting sick of this... ok, BACK to the alternate dimension again... now BACK to the Phantom Zone - what's next? Back to high school? WHEN IS HE GOING TO FLY????? I'm sick and tired of a ""conflicted"" and self-doubting Superman. This is getting really old."
5,"As MOST everyone else states, great series!","Not much we can add to what has already been said--but we wanted our five stars to be counted and so we leave this fairly useless review. If you've watched all the previous seasons, this is a must of course! LOL."
3,disappointed,"After hating season 9, I was hoping 10 would make up for it. It didn't. It was ok, but not enough to make up for the rest. Wishing now I had never bought ANY of the seasons."
1,Worse in the ten year history of the series,This final season I place in the worst season in the ten year history of the series. If I had seen this series on television I would not have purchased the box set.
3,Ok,It shipped fast but product was cheap looking. The box never closed properly. Probably won't buy from this place again.
2,Maybe,"Locked up somewhere in this program I think is some very useful software----but how to get at it? The brief tuturoial is full of non-standard usage and poorly defined concepts, plus following it exactly doesn't give you the indicated results. Technical support from Data Becker is non-existent. No technical support toll-free number, no FAQ list on their web site (I thought maybe I was the only buyer of this program) and e-mail to their web site goes unanswered. I have used other CAD programs that were SIGNIFICANTLY more intuitive. But buy it if you have the time to experiment and play with it---maybe you will have more luck than I."
2,Get what you pay for.,"I bought this glue gun at a local craft store with glue sticks included for about $10.00. In trying to make hair ribbons for my daughter, I find the trigger is very heavy, making accurate glueing a difficult proposition at best. Already the cover for the dual temperature switch has fallen off, and this is the first time I've used it!I do NOT reccomend this item."
1,Broken I guess,This gun heated up quickly and melted the glue but instead of coming out of the nozzle the melted glue came back up from where the glue stick goes in! What a mess! I tried putting a thin wire up the nozzle to see if there was a blockage and the wire came out covered with hot glue but the trigger did not cause the glue to come out of the nozzle. I threw it in the trash and ordered another brand. Maybe just a fluke with this one gun but didn't want to try another of the same brand.
2,"Not impressed, returned it.","Loses power quickly.Very messy to clean, a job that required a trip outside each time.Power settings are functionless, I mean who is going to vacuum on any setting other than the highest."
3,excellant buy for the money,"does everything you'd want a vacuum to do. haven't had it long enough(2 months) to see how it holds up. Only complaint is, it's very noisy even on ""hush"" mode."
4,Good vacuum for the price,I wanted a reasonably priced vacuum that was good on hardwood floors and at picking up pet hair. This model has performed well on both counts--which is not surprising since Consumer Reports said it would. I would buy it again. There are some complaints about the hepa filter. I take it outside to empty the main chamber and bang each end of the filter against a tree or the edge of the porch a few times. The tree doesn't seem to mind the dust and I don't bring any back in the house so everybody is happy.
2,Not the product for me,I didn't purchase this on amazon but my employer bought it a year ago for us to use in the office. We have a really small office probably smaller than my 3 bedroom house and the carpet is pretty short. It worked great for about a month and then just started not picking up very well. I think the power boost button does nothing but make the machine louder.
5,The Security Officers must have book,Once again Dr. Kovacich has excelled. He has produced an updated version of already 'must have' book for any information security officer. It is the sort of book that is useful to both the experienced information security officer and to the person who is new to the area. The book is written in a format that makes it very readable and also that you can easily find that piece of information that you can remember seeing but can't exactly recall where..I wish that he had been writing this type of book when I first started out in the Infosec field. If you only buy one information security book - make sure it is this one.
1,like getting nauseated on junk food,"I knew what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book: one-dimensional characters, melodramatic plot lines, laughably B movie dialogue. There is something horrifiably pleasurable about such mindless escapism. However, after reading 500+ pages, I felt like I had consumed cheap carnival candy. Yuk."
5,LUCKY IS BACK AGAIN,JACKIE COLLINS DID IT AGAIN..EVERYTIME SHE COMES OUT WITH A LUCKY SANTANGELO BOOK THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SHE CANT GET THEM OUT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME! THIS IS THE KIND OF BOOK YOU NEVER WANT TO PUT DOWN. BRIDGETTE IS OLDER AND LEARNING HOW TO BE JUST LIKE HER GODMOTHER!!! AND LUCKY IS HOT AGAIN!! SHE KNOWS HOW TO USE A GUN AND SHE USES IT WELL....
3,Hard Times,This movie was excellent right till the end and thats were it froze up. Lost the last 9 or 10 lines of the moviie which unfortunatly contributed a fairly large amount of symbolizim.
3,WALTER HILL'S STRONG DEBUT MAKES FINE USE OF CHUCK'S STYLE,"Charles 'Chuck' Bronson has often been criticised for his minimalist acting style, mainly in the action thrillers he did with Michael Winner, but he is put to effective use in this solid drama, which is a solid debut for action director, Walter Hill and it also boasts a terrific supporting performance from that other veteran, James Coburn as the gambler who becomes Bronson's aide. Chuck's character, Chaney, may not say much, but you can tell just how he feels by looking at the expressions on his craggy face, something which Bronson, like Eastwood, can convey convincingly. But it's the fights themselves that are the highlights, the best one being the battle in the cage between Bronson and leering, cocky punk, Robert Tessier. The last fight is good, as well, and Bronson sure does move nimbly for a fifty four year old!"
2,Needs a better transfer.,"I love this movie, but this transfer is horrible. The brutally abrupt pan and scan cuts literally made my head spin at points. The film is great, and worth watching, but I hope they put out a widescreen version one day. Maybe they'll do a Walter Hill boxed set with deluxe versions of all his classics. Rent this one until they do, but don't spend money on it."
4,hard times,"I returned the one purchased in October 2006, because I ordered a VHSat $4.99 and you sent me a DVD at over $18.00 for which you gaveme a credit.I ordered a DVD last December at $7.99 plus $2.59 delivery which Ireceived, but why do I have to pay over $17.00 for it????????"
1,Hard Times - full screen UGH !!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD ! Although I throughly enjoy this movie and the characters are as good as they get in movies...Hard Times in the ""full screen"" format does not do this movie the justice and appreciation it deserves."
3,My Favorite Bronson Film,"Charles Bronson, best known for his Death Wish movies, stars as Chaney, a lone wolf who travels from town to town to make some quick cash by fist fighting. Along the way he hooks up with an illegal street fight promoter and hustler named Speed (James Coburn). They make some cash, but Speed's carelessness with his money gets him into trouble with some local thugs.This is a wonderful film set in 1933 New Orleans. The character's are richly developed and played wonderfully. The location is fantastic, and the script is well written.The DVD transfer is acceptable but could have used some cleaning up; it's still decent for a film made in 1975. Unfortunatly, this is full screen only and the audio is mono.For entertainment value I give the film 4 1/2, but as a whole package this DVD rates a three."
5,Great Bible Study Aid,"In this continuation of a wonderfully written series of Bible study guides, Dean and staff have once again done an outstanding service for God and for Christians everywhere. If you are alone, or in a small study group, Dean's work will guide you as you walk with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The book is extremely well organized, easy to read and follow, and provides an excellent foundation for Bible study sessions. In this series, we follow the gospel of Matthew and are given thoughtful insight into the holy scriptures. The book is chock full of useful suggestions for the leader or instructor, and comes complete with pronunciation guides and suggested group activities. A must if you are considering leading a bible study."
2,"Great films, lousy prints","The title of this review pretty much says it all.The print Critic's Choice uses for Way Down South, a remarkable film by the way, is passable - barely. The print for Fisherman's Warf, a really nice movie, is an embarrassment. It's nothing but splice cut. ""Digitally Remastered"" my eye!My advice is to seek out other DVD copies of these great movies. In the long run the few dollars more you'd spend would be worth it. They are worth having, just not from Critic's Choice. I'll never buy another Critic's Choice DVD again."
1,Struggled to get through!,I had a hard time finishing this book. I kept thinking the book would get more interesting but nothing kept my attention. Part two on automobiles was probably the most interesting part but I still nearly put the book away to read others. I was not impressed with the author's style of writing. He seems to have a fascination with one or two words sentences which became very annoying. I would not recommend this book.
4,Good watch,"It's a nice looking watch, but the date numbers are difficult to read.I love the indiglo function to check the time in the dark."
2,Keeps decent time but date function is worthless,"This watch is fine and keeps decent time. The face is definitely on the 'large' size. The band and casing are decent quality. The date function doesn't work well (it gets ""stuck"" between dates and frequently displays the wrong date). I've re-set the date numerous times to try to get it to work and it still only displays the correct date occasionally. Next time I'll invest in a better watch - you get what you pay for."
4,Good Watch For the Money,"This is a good Timex watch. Simple, effective, keeps good time. Indiglo makes watch face easy to read in low light. Calendar date is somewhat difficult to read. I am happy with the purchase."
4,Good wanted more,This box was def a stay up all nighters and read. I only hated the ending left the major question unanswered. I went thru half of the book wanting to know what happened and it's not mentioned at all!
3,SAVE UR MONEY!!!!!,STORYLINE OK.... BUT ENDING WASN'T 2 GOOD .... BORROW THIS ONE. I AM SURPRISED THAT I DID NOT ENJOY THIS BOOK BECAUSE I LOVED A WOMAN'S WORTH TO DEATH...
3,Clunky,"I was dissapointed by the ""clunkiness"" of this game. The framerates are choppy, controls were stiff and the aiming stinks. Not a comparrison with [edited] but I could see this game having some fans. I would rent first."
4,DONT BUY,Dont buy this game. I hated this game unless you like slow old cars and driving by the rules. I say if you want a game like this to by [edited]. I didnt like how the cars were and the camera angles.
3,Mafia Version 0.5,"After playing through Mafia on the PC, this Xbox port is an unexpected disappointment. In hindsight the game never should have been ported to PS2 or Xbox. All of the things that made Mafia so visually arresting on the PC were stripped or deleted from the console version. The draw distance is awful: a hazy fog obscures the beauty of Lost Heaven. The lines on the street barely paint in as the front bumper of your car passes them. The landscape is stripped of detail, leaving only the muddy textures of building surfaces that were forgiveable in the PC game. Many of the customizeable in-game options have been deleted (like the ability to manually shift your car), just adding to the dullness.I suppose if I hadnt played the PC version first, I could have seen this as acceptable. But knowing how the city of Lost Heaven *should* look and sound leaves me with the impression of a dead, barren world on the Xbox. Get a decent computer and play that version of Mafia; it's a world of difference."
4,not enough nada surf material exists.,"If there was a country called nada surf I would go and invade it in the name of finding weapons of mass production. wow, that was brilliant. it's good. the only problem is that it is only three songs long. But the pixie's cover is the reason I bought it. It's actually one of my favorite songs on the planet. Nada surf is one of my most favoritest bands."
3,Not as good as I expected,"While the specifications said this set was stainless steel, the cups that hold the butter started to rust after the first use. I hand-washed and dried them, but wasn't able to remove the stains. I think the stainless steel must be very low grade or just very thin. Even when using the small tea lights, it would still make the butter burn. I have a ceramic set at home that's perfect. But I wanted a set of four for our beach house and can't say I'm that pleased. They ARE nice looking, but not the best quality."
2,"Not A ""Tarantino"" Soundtrac","Robert Rodriguez makes really good movies and he definitely is a good ""guitar"" player. But, these recent soundtracks are not what we got with ""Desperado"" or ""From Dusk to Dawn"". I mean this soundtrack is just that, ""soundtrack sounds and riffs"" from the movie. They work good in the movie, but your not going to want to listen to them on their own. Totally unlike a ""Tarantino"" soundtrack that has actual ""songs"" on it by artists that you will want to listen to separate of the movie. I'm a ""guitar player"" and although I respect Robert Rodriguez as a guitar player, I'll probably never buy one of his ""soundtracks"" again. What's the point, just watch the movie."
4,It's different,"Im a fan of fast paced action, but not hollywood style action, more of Hurt locker, saving private ryan, and district 9 action with the camera constantly moving and running. This film had exactly that, and the lack of background music made it more intense. Other reviewers are right that there is alot of screaming, but then again, its a bunch of everyday people being shot and and killed, i think we all would start screaming as wellOverall, the acting is so so, cinematography was spot on for this type of film, and the idea was pretty good. I wouldnt say it's the best ever, but i'd recommend it."
3,Why can't academics write well?,"I read this book through once, and have read the second half again. I found it very difficult to keep track of different tribes and their movements from Central Asia, into the Balkans and onward. Some of the contributors wrote extremely clearly and their chapters were easy to follow, Others, including the editor, made me cringe. I nearly put the book down while reading the introduction and had to resist taking a red pen to the text. I found the description of the rise of metallurgy interesting although oversimplified. No mention was made of small indigenous metal working. I also agree with the previous reviewer on the confusing description of bell beaker pottery and the use of this style of pottery. Having found bell beaker shards, I would like to know more about the spread and use of this highly decorative and stylized pottery."
2,Interpretation more than scientific,"This book will appeal to those who already believe that religion is a product of the human mind. This is neither a scholarly work nor a scientific treatise but rather Alper's interpretation of data from various unconnected studies and experiments that support his world view. On the back cover of the book, one of the reviewers described Alper's work as ""a lively manifesto."" That is a perfect summary of this book."
5,Awesome!,"Along with ""Man's Search for Meaning"", possibly the most profound and important book I've ever read! Applause to Matt Alper, Horary for the rational mind!Religion and mystical experiences are real things that do exist in the world (even thought the ghosts and mystical forces they talk about can't be literally real), and as such are as legitimate objects of scientific study as anything else, and it's about time someone came along and treated it as such. Gives me hope for the future, too. Because if rational thought is not mankind's greatest asset and hope, I don't know what is. Certainly not irrationality!Wonderful! Fascinating! And with the added virtue of being SIMPLE, so simple a child (ok, at least a teenager) could read it in a day! You'll hear many of your own thoughts placed in a rational order for you so you get a clear picture of what this ""God"" stuff MUST be all about.KUDOS KUDOS KUDOS MATTHEW ALPER BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!!!"
1,"No, David","There is not a one minute span of video where David does not crawl, slither, scamper, or sneak his way into the shot amongst nature's exotic cold-blooded creatures. Who really wants to see an 80 year old man sun bathing on the rocks with iguanas? Such a disappointment."
2,Very CHEAP unlockables....,"I loved the show,so I got the game.It is funny for awhile,but the same moves and one-liners quickly wear on your nerves.The game ends very quick,but what's really bad about this game is the so called unlockable ""bonus"" characters to play as!I was under the impression that you would unlock more celebs to play as;that is NOT the case at all.You just unlock stupid fantasy characters like frankenstien,werewolf,mummy,alien etc.Also the material they used to poke fun at the celebrities seems dated,as if this game was meant to be released a couple years back.Gotham Games could've also added better celebrities to play as and mutilate.I think it would've been funny to see someone like Brittney Spears or Eminem getting impaled or beheaded.But instead they give us Busta Rhymes and Carrot Top!?Take this one for a rental if you are really bored,but PLEASE do not buy this one!"
3,Uninspired and mellow,"I find this the most boring of the Tuckwell versions. He just blends his instrument into the orchestra. The orchestra doesn't bring anything interesting to these amazing peices, and neither does Tuckwell...just compare this version to the firey EMI version with Marriner!"
5,MIU 2.2 pound meat pounder,I love this product. I had been using a mallet type meat pounder in the past and when I finished my wrist would be sore. I saw this type of product being used on several cooking programs and decided to get one. Amazon.com had it at a good price and the reviews were mostly good so I bought one. I used it the weekend after I received it to pound out chicken breasts for Chicken Kiev. It works beautifully! It takes much less effort than my old mallet type and my wrist was not sore when I finished. This solid stainless steel pounder is not cheap but it should last at least the rest of my lifetime and probably will continue to be used by one of my children when I am gone.
3,false description of this produce,Product Dimensions: 4.6 x 3.6 x 3.6 inchesShipping Weight: 2 pounds---------------------------------The description is false!!The weight is 1 pound and 14 oz.The dimensions are 4.6 tall 3&3/8 diameterThe photograph is accurate
1,Box says 1kb 2.2lbs but it's really 800grams or 2lbs. Plus it's made in china.,I'm sorry don't trust stuff made in china to prepare my food. Maybe they shouldn't have put lead in kids toys.
3,Spaces; jazz redefined by modern giants,"What becomes clear to the ""Spaces"" enthusiast is it wasn't an accident. These titans send a well orchestrated message, starting with Miroslav Vitous' melancholy bowed bass. The song makes a world class tempo change via Cobham's solid quarter note feel and Vitous' transition to walking bass. Coryell's chopping scales front a classic combo of working jazz giants. A must for your collection."
2,Frozen for me,"I just cannot agree with the previous reviewers about the quality of this books. Liz Maverick boggles down her characters in so much boring detail that I get to a point where I just don't care about what happens to any of them.Sure, this is chick lit, but there is so little action going on and so much blah, blah its not worth the price of the book. If you like pages and pages of detail this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't bother.This is a pass."
1,"Fluffy, predictable read",It was very hard to get into this book because the premise of three young women leaving Northern California does not seem plausible as they go on their adventures. The writing was stiff and I put it down after 2 chapters...luckily it was a loan from a friend!!
3,should have been more but visually interesting,"Frankly, I thought the movie sort of went nowhere but there were interesting people and places. I would find it easier to talk to a group about the history and tradition and theology of contemplative prayer than I would explaining why these monasteries kept the collections of bones which were sort of macabre. A bit of conversation about the text ""The Pilgrim"" and some discussion of ""The Philokalia"" might have filled things in a bit."
2,I don't get it,"I'm a huge fan of everything I've heard of Goldstein's on This American Life and WireTap and the concepts of his other books, which I have not yet read, and had high hopes for LBID. However, I simply didn't get it.I didn't laugh once and I didn't really enjoy reading this book. I feel like I'm missing some piece of context that a lot of people have; maybe it just isn't for me.I am getting ready to read his other books, which I still expect to love."
5,Very helpful for those hurting,"I just finished reading this book and loved it. It helps put things into perspective. I would recommend it to anyone who is going through trials in their life. It's on my all time favorite books list, I just bought a copy for my mother-in-law and am encouraging many of my friends to read it."
5,Excellent reference,"I read Walking with God on the road you never wanted to travel some months back and have kept it out because I refer to sections that I've highlighted when I need help with my impending divorce.I found Mark's words and passages a source of healing and comfort. I hope that I can look back on my experience and email Mark with a success story someday. If you are currently dealing with a huge ""why did this happen to me"" situation this book is the one to read and re-read because of the many examples, biblical passages, and words of encouragement are well worth the book's price."
3,Good book but lacks depth,"I believe that this author is a learned servant of God who truly set forth to minister to hurting folks. I really appreciated the relevant and powerful examples of people whose lives were changed forever...and how many of them rose up over tradegy and tribulation. However, the author presents as a man looking through a window into others' lives. He does not seem to be one who has ever been crushed and broken and that makes a difference."
5,M-51 Engineers Field Bag,"Great quality product for the price. Rigid/robust feel, plenty of storage. I was pleasantly surprised to notice the siding in the ""laptop"" main compartment is foam lined."
5,Great Book,"A must read for anyone thinking of a career in law enforcement. A great story that describes the challenges, triumph & tragedy officers endure."
3,This is not a dog fight tape!,"I don't think that anyone that did the tags for this product actually read the product description first. It is not a dog fighting tape, it is a tape to help you train your dog NOT to fight or be aggressive with other dogs. At least take a look at a product before smearing it with tags such as ""appalling"", ""disgusting"", ""shameful"", ""sick"" and ""cruelty"". It doesn't help your (worthy) cause when you make mistakes like this."
1,Windows Yuck!,Windows ME has made me Windows SICK! This thing crashes more than a drunk in a game of bumper cars! I can't run multiple programs at the same time without the thing freezing! I'm taking a BIG risk right now because I'm downloading an MP3 as I write this review. This is the second time I have to download it because Windows ME shut down half way through the last time I tried it! (...) Don't buy this junk!
1,"Yes, it does freeze","It freezes if you actually make your computer work. If you don't ever try to multitask it won't freeze. Duh. Hey, if you only bought that $1000 dollar computer to play Minesweeper and check out spam ads for septic-tank cleaners and Viagra, feel free to use Windows ME. If you actually want to play real video games, play media files, surf the net, and chat (all at the same time), get Windows XP. ME stands for Many Errors--be warned!"
3,Good Enough,"Windows Me does have installaltion problems, which happened to me -- just crashed in the installation process. But overall, not a bad upgrade, worth the bucks."
1,Junk,"I used this software to upgrade from Windows 95 and the only advantage I've found after using it for three weeks is that my computer shuts down a little faster. Other than that, everything else happens much more SLOWLY than it did before. This has been a big disappointment.TO MICROSOFT: I think you've been getting a bum deal with your legal woes, but that's no reason to pass one on to your loyal customers."
2,"Well, Bill, you proved me wrong...",I wouldn't have believed you could come up with an OS flakier than Windows 95! My brand new laptop that came pre-installed with 'Me' blue-screened before it even got completely booted when i started it up! In four days of use I've had to use my 'Recovery' disks twice already. Buying this new computer would have been a great excuse to switch to Apple and get a Powerbook but i thought i'd give you one more chance; my mistake.
2,Time to get an upgrade,"When I first got Windows Me in December 2000, I thought it was a great improvement over Windows 98. However, after 3 years of use, this ever so great computer has become a giant pain. I have plenty of space, yet programs freeze and you need to restart your computer again. I am constantly press Ctrl+Alt+delete to see what is going wrong in Adobe Photoshop or Zoo Tycoon. It always has a ""not responding"" sign behind it and when I press ""end task"", my whole desk top disappears leaving me only with my background picture. Our printer and scanner don't seem to function anymore and installing games and new programs takes atleast 30 minutes. And when you restart your computer, you have to wait 5 minutes to let everything on your desktop load before you can try anything with out it not working. Iam also frequently getting blue screens with error signs on it. This computer doesn't seem to cooperate with me anymore, so I am going to buy XP."
3,They should have called this Windows 98 3rd edition..,Ive Tried WindowsMe(Beta Version)Nothing isn't Really New in this Latest Version Of the Popular Windows Series(WindowsME).Just Updated Drivers/and A More Stable OS than Windows 98.WindowsMe is just like Windows 98 but with a Fresh Coat of Paint.Nothing New.
2,"On the skin, not under it.","Wolfe was unquestionably the most entertaining pop culture chronicler of the 60's and 70's. He and Hunter Thompson burrowed under the skin of all manner of Californians and other New Americans and put us under there too. Wolfe led the way on a wild, joyous, outrageous trip. Most of Hooking UP, except for the title essay and the Noyce piece, is very superficial. As an admirer of Wolfe, I was uncomfortable for him as I read his savaging of Susan Sontag. Her main sin seems to have been getting more 90's ink than Wolfe. His three line dismissal of Noam Chomsky was also embarassing. Reread Kandy and Pump House instead."
4,Good,"The ""Rococo Marxists"" piece is wonderful (except for his cruel dismissiveness of kids suffering from ADD). So are a lot of other pieces here. The ""My Three Stooges"" piece is a bit much, though, where he knocks Mailer, Updike and Irving for criticizing A MAN IN FULL. For one thing, it WAS a very flawed novel. The other thing is he keeps getting in digs about how old the three men are, WHEN WOLFE IS IN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS MAILER AND UPDIKE. And Wolfe is a LOT older than John Irving! Irving is in his 50's, whereas Wolfe is in his 70's. So who is Wolfe to call John Irving old? I found that part of the essay, frankly, bizarre."
2,Wrong Movie... TO BUY,"I bought this because i thought it was going to be good like texas chainsaw massacre due to the misleading reviews on here. It wasnt. It was nowhere near as good as tcm. The acting SUCKED, the plot predictable and the story has been done before. The only 2 decent actors were Jeremy sisto and the other guy who was going to the interview in the begining. I do not recomend this. I would rent this if you want to see it but definetly do not buy, especially for 25 bucks! Its not even worth the 7 bucks i paid used for it. I shoulda just stuck with the horror classics. I recomend you do the same."
1,By The Numbers,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I'm wondering if we all saw the same movie. But there is only one WRONG TURN and, man, did I take it.Eliza Dushku is a knock-out but, if you stare at the photo of her on the DVD box, you've pretty much seen everything she's going to do in this movie. That beautiful face looking scared and lots of running.The grotesque hillbilly cannibals are undeveloped monsters who menace the 90210-looking cast.Strictly by-the-numbers drive-in monster movie, minus the humor and titillation of the B-movies from the 70's. Every scene will look and feel familiar.(By the way, if the West Virginia in this movie looks a little flat, that's because it was filmed in Canada)."
2,its a bad turn out,"released last year, this movie looked interesting in its trailer, but then when I saw it in the theaters. it was pure stupidity. not much in this bland and predictable horror gore fest. it only clocks in at 84 minutes,a short and forgettable horror movie. though the presence of Eliza Dushku was in here, she showed some of her moves we have seen from the past in Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Desmond Harrington from Ghost Ship and Jeremy Sisto from Suicide Kings also stars. the mountain men are disfigured and are really just plan take the movie to the dumps. there are some good moments, well for one when the skanky girl asks the guy to drop trou, Jeremy Sisto's fleeing from the cabin and when he gets 3 arrows in his back and basically thats it. stir away or if your a Dushku fan like I am, watch it and be bored or not."
3,You'll think twice about taking short cuts and camping trips again.,"Wrong Turn isn't the best or worst in this genre. It falls squarely in the middle and for just under 90 minutes, it's a great way to pass the time. There's nothing spectacular about the acting, but the film is beautifully shot and the kills are actually very impressive. More than anything, you'll feel tense the whole time, finding yourself yelling at the characters to run and such. It will definitely leave you with a creepy feeling, but I've seen much more frightful films. Still, since I was watching alone at night, I was glad it wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen. You'll have fun trying to figure out who will make it out alive and when you see the backwoods mountain man, no doubt that if you're ever in that part of the country, you'll spring for a hotel room real quick rather than take your chances in the unknown woods. Goes great with popcorn! Enjoy!"
1,"terrifying, but not in a good way.","WOW. i am not sure if there are words to describe how truly horrible this movie was. there have been comparisons to texas chainsaw massacre, and that is dead on. The only problem is it is an extra crappy version of TCM. This movie was totally devoid of any character developement, so you didn't care who got killed with the notable exception of jeremy sisto. The villains (inbred west virginiers) were an almost laughable bunch of lumbering idiots who grunted alot. Everything was beyond unbeleivable, the amount of people that were implied in their killing streak alone was ridicules. There were no scary moments at all and barely any tense ones. TCM is at least, in my opinion, watchable again. This? i'd rather get hacked to death by the ""creatures"" from Wrong Turn than watch Wrong Turn."
1,Ugh. Utterly devoid of entertainment.,"Just terrible. I am shocked at the positive reviews this boring drivel is receiving. Train-wreck dialogue--you know it's going to be ridiculous in a fright flick like this, but that's part of the fun. The lines here are just dead weights dropping on every scene. A mere handful of victims, with only one interesting character--Jeremy Sisto. And only a few shots of the baddies! One star for the ""In the Trees"" sequence, the rest fails miserably."
3,Wrong Turn,"I found this movie to be chillingly realistic. It's not unusual to get lost - anywhere. But to be completely unfamiliar with one's surroundings can have disastrous and tragic results as it did in this movie. Inbreeding occurs in more families than we'd like to think. I especially enjoyed the performances of the three actors who portrayed the ""mountain men."" Their cool, tireless, unending hunt of the four lost youth was vicious and frightening."
1,Bad Movie,"If you want to buy this movie,..don't. It wasn't even scary. The ""murderers"" or the killers looked like nomes from the lord of the rings.. it was a horrible movie."
2,Not so great,"I decided to rent this film because of Eliza Dushku and I'm a fan or horror films. Some parts were creepy but some lines were just too stupid. How many times can you have a decoy say ""Hey dummies, I'm over here!"" while the others execute the rest of the plan...well twice in this movie. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't reccomend it unless you are VERY bored. Try Chainsaw Massacre, much better."
1,Stupid attempt to perpetuate a WV sterotype,"""folks get waylaid in the deep West Virginia wilds by a trio of grotesque mountain men.""What nonsense!!!!!!!!! No wonder the rest of the world thinks that WV is populated by ""inbred backwoods cannibals.""Completely objectionable!"
4,THIS WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD MOVIE,"A GROUP OF TEENAGERS ARE LOST IN THE WOODS OF WEST VIRGINIA. BUT THE TERROR BEGINS WHEN A GROUP OF CANNIBALS BEGIN KILLING AND COLLECTING THEM ALL ONE BY ONE. THIS VIOLENT HORROR MOVIE DEFINITELY HAS SOME CLEVER PLOTTING AND IT HAS SOME GOOD MURDER SEQUENCES. EVEN THOUGH ''THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE'' [THE 1974 VERSION, NOT THAT CORNY-A** VERSION THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR] IS THE MEASURING STICK OF THE CANNIBAL-TYPE HORROR MOVIES, THIS IS UP THERE WITH THAT INCREDIBLE MOVIE. CRITICS MIGHT SAY THIS IS TRASH, BUT I SAY THIS IS A HIGHLY ENTERTAINING HORROR MOVIE. HORROR FANS SHOULD BE THRILLED BY THIS MOVIE."
2,"ok, but stick to the classics","alright, so wrong turn had a few gory moments but not enough. If you want to see a real horror movie stick to classics. Like George romero's Dead Trilogy, or Evil Dead. The only new good horror movie ive seen this year would be cabin fever. That stays true to 1980's horror fimls. And I also hated how this horror movie called itself a 80's horror movie. They didnt go into any detail about that, they only did it so 80's horror fans would be more intrested. 80's scary movie have, blood and guts, and the occasional naked girl. Stick to the classics."
1,Deliverance is a great movie...This movie not so good,"To put it nicely this movie stinks. Although some parts of the movie are entertaining and keep you watching this flick hardly meets any of my criteria for a top notch horror movie. The in-bred hillbilly mountain men are not that scary and the acting is very sub-par. An obvious attempt to rip-off TCM and Deliverance. It's really not worth my time to elaborate on it but I will say this...comparing this movie to Deliverance is like comparing Mike Tyson to Fred Savage. If you like trash then you'll like ""Wrong Turn""."
2,ANOTHER WASTED OPPORTUNITY,"Good concept. Good cast. Good scares. Good suspense. That being said, the good things about Wrong Turn are outweighed by the wasted opportunities to be unique.Instead, Wrong Turn falls into the realm of typical, forgettable, predictable movies that are being mass produced these days. It doesn't take any chances, it doesn't do anything different and it doesn't leave a lasting impression.The movie builds up into something that is gonna be cool, scary and unique, but eventually you realize that... nope... same old movie, different actors. Another movie that didn't have the guts to break the mold and thus is just ordinary."
2,It started off so well ...,"WRONG TURN has great promise at the beginning. I was even beginning to think that I had found a modern horror film that didn't rely on the cliches that other horror films of today rely on.WRONG TURN started going downhill when the ridiculous looking inbred brothers appeared. So unrealistic, too much makeup ...I didnt even care for the characters after that, as they tried to escape from the evil.Why are film makers still making silly movies like this? What a sheer waste of money. Why not make a film on something worthwhile?"
2,Same old horror,"I really would not recommend this film to anybody. Its basically about eliza's boyfriend breaks up with her and her 4 friends take her out on a trip to the woods and they get stranded because a guy crashes into their car. They all go to find a phone what sense does that make?? I dont know of any phones in the woods and its basically the same kind of concept you see in other movies they get lost killers come after them blah blah blah eliza survives with the guy that crashes into them while the other two couple are doomed to die. It is so predictable and corny. The ""truck"" that the monsters have is such a copy of the jeepers creepers concept its basically a rip off of every horror movie there is. Rent it dont buy it.Its good to people who are new to watching horror. Spend your money on something better!"
3,"Wrong Turn..Ummm. Eh, ok.","Well, well, well. Now I know some of you like the campy lost in the woods horrors where a bunch of deformed freaks are coming after you so I can understand you liking this movie for that reason. Aside from that, this doesn't give much in the line of horror. A few cool deaths, but this story has been done too many times for me to remain interested. Not to be completely pessimistic 'cause E Dushku is gorgeous, the other chic steals the show by her amazing body. See where I'm getting with this? Once you realize there's no story or horror, you try to make the best with what you've got. Anyway, its pays homage to the basic texas chainsaw massacre/deliverance audience and is slightly entertaining."
1,***Don't Buy***,THis cd truly is awful. The lyrics are lame! It must have been written by some speds!!
2,Mine got STAINED,"The first time we used them on Hamburger Helper they got stained with the cheese mix. Other than that they were OK, but that was the singular reason I got them. I was sick of looking at our white, sauced, stained old spoons.Now I have blue,cheese stained, spoons. Very disappointing."
4,Goes in the dishwasher!,"I ordered these because they would go in the dishwasher. I do not like to put wooden spoons through because they dry out and crack. These work well, have not melted at all, and seem to come clean very easily.The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that the larger spoon is *really big* and has a very thick handle. I still use it when I use my large soup pot, but I find the small size is much handier."
3,Color of product,"The product is excellent - the color is not. The BLUE is actually a LIGHT BLUE (a little darker and brighter than a ""baby blue"") and not the dark blue as pictured."
4,Poder sobre el techo de un hotel,"Increíble es ver la versión completa de dont cry sobre el hotel. Ese pedacito en que canta el tipo de Blind Melon junto a la banda en el video original, ahora es un clip completo al final de la cinta. Esta especial sorpresa ocurre tras entrevistas, todas en inglés (poco académico). Los diálogos a veces no se entienden mucho. Hay efectos especiales y música, mucha música. Lo mejor es eso, la música. Mi versión del video tiene problemas con el traking y a veces pierde el stereo, pero definitivamente si te gustan los Guns, te lo recomiendo."
5,great,Aloha Baby-Sitter's is an awesome book! I like when Dawn and Jessi and the teacher and the kids clean up the beach
2,"Great idea, disappointing delivery.","Maybe I was expecting too much. The 12 steps used in recovery programs have helped millions of people in a variety of situations. This book doesn't quite make the transition from the 12 steps to chronic illness. Although the basic premise, that we can look at and heal emotional pain, and find spiritual serentity, is good; the path isn't laid out clearly. It's too sketchy, nebulous, and intangible.Cleveland writes, ""Ask your fear what it needs from you."" If this works for you, great. I just found it frustrating. She has some good ideas. It was just hard for me to fish them out."
4,MST3K - That pretty much sums it up,"Good episode, bad movie. I THINK that this is one of the sequels to Ator - Fighting Eagle, I can't be sure because I think I forgot that movie as a defensive mechanism. Some great lines in this one...heck, even the box made me laugh. Not the best episode by any means, but still a real cracker. Recommended."
5,New #1 Jazz Band and vocalist,The best combination of jazz band and vocalist I've heard in more than 50 years. I lived in New Orleans in the 1960's when Preservation Hall was #1 with me. That was until now. Magnolia IS IT....Tops with Topsy Chapman
1,Not the best of Dana Carvey,"I used to be a fan of SNL mainly because of Dana Carvey. I was looking forward to this DVD, but was very disappointed by the selection. This is definitely not the best of Dana Carvey on SNL! Dana used to be laugh-out-loud funny, but there is not much of that on this DVD.It is possible that for others the selections on this DVD are exactly what they hoped to see. That is always the danger with this type of ""best of"" compilations. The DVD is inexpensive, so if you are a fan of Dana, it is still a worthwhile purchase. And there are some good moments."
5,A Classic!,"My mother read this book to me as a child and I loved it. It was always so exciting and funny to me, especially the picture of Bill popping out of the bad guy's bathtub. Even now it makes me laugh!I also used to take this book with me when I babysat and would read it to kids before bed. I never met a kid who didn't like Bill and Pete. It's the perfect mix of adventure and wit, and a great tale of friendship.Will it raise your child's IQ by a huge margin? Probably not. Is that what bedtime stories are for? Not really.Will they remember this book twenty years (and beyond) later with fond memories, and then read it to their own children? Absolutely."
1,Really Cheezy,"I just received this DVD in the mail from Amazon. I can't believe how bad the quality of this film is. The Cheezy company is cheezy. They must have found the master under a rock. The movie looks smeared and blurry. This is too bad as it doesn't seem all that bad for a 1950's Sci-fi movie. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my money on the lousy print. Hopefully a good company will release this movie in the future."
3,Not for Men...,"I ordered these sandals for myself. My foot size is 7.5 so ordered 8 thinking that it will be comfortable. After receiving them, though the size says it is 8, I couldn't get my feet fit in, very tight. My wife whose foot size is 7 has exact fit, so she is using. Look, comfort and feel wise they great when in ""sale"" price."
1,Not at all as pictured.,"I ordered the brown color expecting a light brown leather sandal. I received a mud brown, almost maroon swede sandal that looked awful. The tag matched the style and color here, so I am not sure what the deal is."
3,"Bag great, after it aired out...","Bag was perfect for the Panasonic camera I have, although I admit that I don't carry every gadget that goes with it everywhere I go. My primary complaint is that it was clear that the bag was wet in storage (paper wrinkled, musty smell). Won't order from this company again if they are willing to sell damaged goods. I did keep it based on the price and my desperate need for a bag at that point in time."
2,"Wasted money, wasted time","That's what you get when you buy this book. The book simply reprints the same material you get in the DISC instrument. There is nothing, nothing, new here. There is no insight, no detail, no discussion on how to use the information. I use DISC constantly in my business and found this book a total waste. If you want to understand DISC go to www.discinsights.com and get their home study program. It's terrific, detailed, and provides lots of examples. I also recommend the book ""The 4-Dimensional Manager."" Still not as good as the above reference but at least it's worth the money."
4,Insanity,"It seems strangely coincidental that I saw this movie on cable late at night as well. Regardless of how I saw it, the movie was phenomenal in the sense it portrayed a form of reality in relationships, like ""Requiem for a Dream"" does. It is not a mushy lie and fabrication Hollywood innovated just to make you hope for a love that doesn't even exist like most romances. It portrays sacrifice between two lovers, a true and realistic sacrifice. But with such sacrifice comes sorrow, a deep seeded sorrow that seems irremovable by the end of the movie. It's up to you to watch it, obviously, but if you have loved and hurt before, it's the perfect cinematic piece of art to comfort your soul. I never thought a director could be so intelligent in the sense of seeing what love really means and then converting it into a piece of art."
2,"Yo, Adrien!!","I want to say to all of you, I had every intention of liking this movie. I have a soft spot for Adrien Brody's Bronx/Manhattan sadness. He reminds me of the good guys that I grew up with in Queens. He's probably one of the nicest guys in Hollywood right now and I was thrilled when he won for best actor last year at the Oscars. But let's face it:This film was such a dog! You have to be desperately seeking art in any form to think this was even remotely interesting let alone entertaining. The only reason I didn't shut the DVD off in the first half hour was because of the respect I have for Brody.Yo, Adrien, be a little more judicious with the roles you pick and show a little more influence in who you costar with in the future, OK?"
4,anonymous,Let's just say Adrien Brody does a better job in this film than The Pianist. If you liked the Pianist then you have to see his performance in this film.
3,Pretty Cute,"I got this for a 10-year-old boy. When i got the product, I honestly thought, ""wow, it is small..."" and thought he might not like it. However, boys are boys. He LOVED it. he played with it for like thirty minutes. I am glad I got him this money bank. For the future buyers, it might look cheap, but boys will like it. Tell them to try this on a flat, solid surface."
4,Decent,The small one was broken when I rec'd it. The larger one didn't work that great on my pocket knife but it seems reall good for my survival knife. So I would say it's pretty decent.
3,80 Minutes of Chonda - Isn't that Special,"After attending the taping of this video earlier in the year I knew the stories were funny and the music was touching. This video captures the concert well, although I was suprised by the decision to turn Q&A and the concert opening video into ""DVD Extras"". It makes the beginning of the concert odd.If you are a Chonda fan this is a good look at her on stage in one of her favorite places. Her stories are on the mark and the music is good. There is an audio editing flaw on the Sandi Patti Video ... a bit strange, but the concert itself and the revealing Q&A segment are worth the price."
3,Too many steps,"Unless you really want to know your body fat percentage on a daily (or weekly) basis, it's not worth the trouble to use that function on the scale. It will take programming for more than one person, and each user, even the primary one, has to go through a few steps to activate the body fat % feature. Too much trouble! It's also fairly lightweight, and moves around on the floor easily. I have a big dog, and when she bumps against the scale, which is in my bedroom, she turns it on. That will run the batteries down a little quicker."
2,Accurate Scale. Not to measure bodyfat!,At first glance this scale looks fairly sophisticated. Looks can be deceiving. I'm fairly certain that the body fat sensor don't do anything at all. Why does a body fat measuring device need to know if you are an athlete or what your height is? If is truly measuring resistance through your body this info should be irrelevant! What it is actually doing is calculating your BMI. That is completely useless if you want to know your bodyfat percentage! Don't believe me? Change your height! Your body fat will go down if you say you are taller and will go up if you say you are shorter! In exact accordance with a BMI chart! Utterly useless!!!I rated this a two because the scale works very well. People having trouble with the scale must be using their unit on carpet! That or their's is defective.
3,don't if accurate,"I really don't know if scale is accurate, it weighs the same with and without clothes the same. I step on weight watchers scale and it's says different reading."
3,from the back cover,"""The famous novel that reveals the private world of men and women involved in sex research...first-rate storytelling"" - New York TimesCan passion be studied under laboratory conditions?Can its peaks and valleys be charted on a graph?Can its innermost workings be captured on color film?Dr. Prescott and his cool, lovely associate, Martha freeman, were certain that the answer to each question was yes - and that important scientific and social benefits would flow from their research.Discreetly, the appeal went out for volunteers - male and female, married and unmarried, college students and prostitutes. And, with suprising enthusiasm, hundreds came to offer their bodies to the call of science..."
1,not worth it,"My daughter opened this gift on Christmas morning. She put them on and immediately tried to 'slide'. They did slide on the carpet, but we all soon learned that she could do about the same with a pair of socks and our hardwood floors. It was a [...] purchase!"
4,The punniest book you can find,"I've had this book for 10 years and everytime I'm with a new crowd of people I bring it out, and soon after people are rolling on the floor. The funniest sections are ""Prinderella and The Cince"" and ""Ladle Rat Rotten Hut"". If you practice enough to read these aloud everyone will be amazed and entertained. The only down side is that there are alot of ""un-funny"" sections, but there are jewels sprinkled within, and for the price I would definitely recommend this."
5,"Pendant Wishbone 18""",I love this necklace. It is fun to wear and I receive many compliments on it. Would highlyrecommend this. It appears to be of good quality.
5,beautiful necklace,The necklace is pretty. The wishbone charm is not too big. and it looks very dainty. But the chain isn't ral strong.
3,Really to small,"really to small I was expecting something better they need to have sort it probably for age this, can be good for a teenager"
3,not actual sized,"i would not recommend this product. the wishbone is much smaller than the website picture would have you believe. in addition, the chain is very thin but i guess appropriate for the price of 16.00 dollars. still i was unimpressed of this product."
4,Broken Chain,"Love the wishbone, thankfully I wanted to put it on a chain I already owned because it arrived with a broken chain!! Its larger than I had thought but still very nice."
2,"Cute pendant, lousy chain","The pendant is lovely. Just the right size and very lightweight. However, after wearing it for less than a day, the chain broke. It wasn't even caught on anything, it just snapped on its own. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much for such a cheap necklace, but I was still disappointed that it didn't even last a full day."
4,"Friends love it, too","I wear this necklace pretty much every day. So many people have asked where I've purchased this, and I've received many compliments. Chain is a little delicate, but so far it's held up."
4,durable,well i was looking for a neclace that my young boys would not be able to pull at and break so easy. This neclace has held up and is still shiny and beautiful.
2,Will NOT fit stock 79 CJ7s,"The add says it will fit stock CJs - with modification required if there is factory AC. NOT THE WHOLE STORY! It turns out it also needs significant modification with stock heater/air plenum in the 79 CJ7. Called seller & they said I would have to cut the enclosure (it's sealed) to fit. I'm certain that if I do that I will get whistles and other issues once the speakers start to move in the enclosure. I'm going with just the ""Mod Pod"" under-door enclosures (same manufacturer) and live with whatever sound I get from those. I returned the Centra Pods."
4,This book formed the foundation for Superman!,"Bought as a gift for my son, and he thoroughly loves the book. From my perspective, I found that the delivery was prompt and the well packaged..and the price was right."
4,great first impression,"I haven't worn this watch for long but I'm shocked just how nice it is. It's well made with nice balance and it's as ""weighty"" as my rolex. Very nice rich looking band. It's a steal @ $75.00. If you need a dress watch you won't be afraid to wear, I recommend one of these, at least on appearance."
5,This will make a star out of you!,This is a great game. I have singstar for PS2 but this one is more fun. There are lots more songs and you can customize your singer which is a lot of fun. I do like that singstar has the actual videos but this is almost better because you can watch your avatar sing. Everyone in the family loves this one.
1,Worst Frankie movie ever,"At first I was upset a bit that I saw it was only 50 minutes long. Then as I started watching it I thought that this movie is way too long!There was about 10 minutes that I thought was funny and worth watching -- the scene of him talking to his fantasy girl with the drawn on stitches. Her silent movie type dialogue was pretty funny. Otherwise I agree with the ""this movie blows"" review.The joejoedancer review who gave it 5 stars - must be smoking crack and/or thinks they are cool by liking such an ""avant-garde"" film, which it is not.Creepersin - get a life!"
4,This DVD is a compilation of his 1987 TC and KF videos.,"If you have the VHS tapes he made in 1987 - ""David Carradine: T'ai Chi Workout"" (ASIN: B00000DGGX or ASIN: 6302817668) and ""David Carradine's Kung Fu Workout"" (ASIN: 6302702844) - then there is not really anything new here in the workout sections. However, for those who have been waiting for him to put those 1987 workouts on DVD, this is it! They're both here. I really liked his ""Shaolin Cardio Kickbox"" tape. I haven't seen the ""Shaolin Strength Workout"" tape yet, but I'll probably get both when he releases them on DVD. Maybe he'll put both Shaolin workouts on the same DVD!"
4,Tai Chi Workout for Begineers,David Carradine and the other Instructors made during these exercise fun. The step-by-step instructions were easy to follow and you really do get a peaceful feeling after during the exercise.
5,I've heard this as Korean +3 bonus track release!!!,"At first, I've heard of 1 song of this album from the Nuclear Blast promo CD, and I was very shocked that song was very cool. Finally, there comes Korean release + 3 bonus tracks, and that was very very cool!!! If you like Heavy metal, you must have their albums!!!"
4,A GIFT for my Wife!,"I'm not really the Best person to review this dvd set since it was bought as a gift.I have watched this show and do agree with my Wife that it does show Good wholesome family values. It is also one of her Favorite shows to watch.Personally I prefer other genres, but did like Mr. Landon in the Bonanza series.If you are interested in family values, life lessons, and rustic settings this is the dvd series for you."
2,Non-American Customers,"In addition to the problems discussed by other reviewers, be aware that unlike Seasons 1 & 2, and contrary to the advertising on the packaging, Season 3 DVDs are NOT region-free, but play on region 1 players only."
5,DVD SETUP IS BAD BUT WELL WORTH IT!!,"I understand viewers complaints about the DVD setup and how one person put it "" Michael Landon sounds like hes on Hellium.""I don't see it as that bad. But was a little upset when there where no Chapters only scene selection which made you guess rewind or fastforward to where you wanted to get.It was a very low budget project I guess to see how many people would buy the DVD's. For the price.. I won't complain it could have been higher.. and still didnt get over that I didnt have to go through commercials. As for parts being cut out.. Mabey somewhere down the road NBC will do a better job. But I 'am a huge fan and happy that all the episodes are finally out on DVD."
5,more lhop please!!!,"I love little house on the prairie, so this is a must have for any LHOP fan. This is the season where Mary Ingalls looses her sight. My favorite episodes are ""i'll be waving as you drive away"", ""the stranger"" where the ingalls take in a spoiled kid to teach some values to, and ""here comes the brides"" where Ms. Beadle and Nellie Oleson get married."
2,stick with the video...its far better,"This DVD fails to deliver by a long shot....it was supposed to include all the deleted scenes, yet the movie was supposed to have a scene where someone is being puched down the throat, this was present in the video but not in the dvd. The picture is ok and you get some bonus material. The menu features tend to get irritating after a while with a repetitive song which keeps ringing in your ears for the rest of the day. The movie deserves 4 stars but the dvd only gets 2. Stay way clear of this one."
4,Troma Shoots and Scores,"Made for a fraction of the cost of most MTV videos, there are plenty of cheaps laughs and gross out gags for the fan of B-movie horror/comedies.Nicely paced and well crafted, Team Troma throws the gags around but keeps a semi-horror flick going simultaneously.Funny characters, hyper dialogue and decent effects make this a great watch in the right mood."
5,Magnificent,Truly one of the greatest written pieces I have had the utmost pleasure to read. Wonderfully descriptive in every way.
3,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"The book is full of imagery, at times far to much. I wish I would have read the book prior to seeing the movie."
5,delightful conjectures,"This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate."
5,Wonderful!,"This is one of my favorite books! I can't believe how well it is writen. I love classics and the picture of Dorian Grey is one of the best. It's a very good story about vanity, cruelty, and greed.I really don't like books by mdern day authors, like Tom Clancy and so on. They word things as well as authors did back then."
1,No Extras,"Honestly - the book came brand new, but it didn't have any of the footnotes that other people's versions had. I was disappointed by that. Also, the pages are HUGE with small print. Don't get this version if you're reading it for a book club or school, you'll be disappointed."
3,Nice book and really nothing more,"When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: ""The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely"", and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we ""owe' it to him to read ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""."
4,Good,It arrived very quickly. It was perfect for me to carry around while at work. The quality was what I paid for. Thank you.
4,Worth Reading,"This book is really worth reading! Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"
4,interesting,yes it is a very interesting book but so many times when lord henery was talking my mind started to wander. it was sometimes really complicated. thinking back it was a really neat and creative story. but i didn't like it as much as my friend thought i would. i don't think i would buy this book. rent it from the library first. its a aquired taste.
2,It has a rip on the back page,This came by the time they said it would be arriving so I'm glad for that.But I don't remember reading about the rip on the book.Also the cover picture is different than this picture. Does this happen a lot?
4,There's a reason why it's so popular,"The book is a fairly easy read and there are some clear morals offered from the story and a reflection on our culture's obsession with appearances and such. Some of the characters are interesting, particularly Lord Henry, who really captivates many readers of the book."
3,Good Book,I really enjoyed this book but there were times when the characters or the author would go on about philosophy that was very interesting but a little boring.
4,Very good book with twists and turns galore!,"Interesting plot, sometimes a little hard to understand, but overall an excellent piece of literature"
1,Disgraceful,"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray. The editing error ""Did you saw a sailor?""There is another editing error that occurs when the character Alan Campbell comes to see Dorian. A letter is presented to Alan and the reader has no idea what this is about. I am going to try to find another version of this classic. This book was terrible."
5,These Girls Can Rock,"I don't have much to say other than this is a truly exceptional album. With so much garbage out there, it's refreshing to buy a CD that one can actually enjoy listening to again & again. Anyone who doubts girls, and cute ones at that, can play metal needs to hear this."
5,From Back Cover,"In the blaze of a Carolina summer, among the poison ivy and loblolly pines, eight Marines have been killed by misfired mortar shells. Deciding that his battalion has been ""doping off,"" Colonel Templeton calls for a 36-mile forced march to inculcate discipline. THE LONG MARCH is a searing account of this ferocious ordeal - and of the two officers who resist. In Lieutenant Culver and Captain Mannix, Styron has created unforgettable portraits of civilized men tested to their physical and spiritual limits."
4,Very nice Jolson piece for your collection,"This collection of 19 early Jolson tracks makes for almost an hour of enjoyable listening. The first two tracks are the Guy Lombardo recordings, tracks 3 through 18 are Brunswick recordings, and the last track is from a Kraft Music Hall broadcast. This is a fairly clean disc with some good recordings."
5,The most BESTEST game of Power Rangers Ever!!,"This game kicks major @$$!!! It's actually harder and difficult than any other past Power Ranger game, even Dino Thunder(which you had to rank an A depending on how well you play)!! Needless to say but..... THIS GAME KICKS @$$!! Buy it!!"
4,Micah got the job done,"First I have to say job well done Micah . I just finishedreading Until Death Do Us Part and I have to say Micah can take care of business when no was else did. She had no shame in her game and she took care of business . Dominque you got yours . I hope I have not given away to much of the story .Now I want to say want a love Noah and Andrea had it truly was Until Death Do Us Part and then some. Noah is a man I'm sure we would love to love us. He had so much love for Andrea and he was not ashamed to show it or tell it. When she was killed by mistaken identity I could actually feel his pain. I really enjoyed the memoirs of Noah and Andrea more that the mystery parts. I would have prefered reading the whole book about such great love.Having said all that I must admit I would actually rate this story with 3.5 or 3.8 * . I gave it 4 because I felt 3 * was to low it was between 3.5 and 4* . I got lost in some of the mystery, but the love he had for his wife was truly awesome."
1,Cardboard Acting,"He's On My Mind is not a good movie. Sometimes poor camera work or a bad script can be excused when the acting is outstanding. Then there are times when everything conspires against a film.The acting, the script, and the camera work were all bad in this film. Every actor was reading their lines, or trying to remember what they memorized a few minutes before being on camera. Almost every actor had difficulty moving with grace and ease in front of the camera. The story was not very good at all, on the outside chance somebody decides to watch this stinker, I won't ruin the single worthwhile moment in the movie. The camera work was all bad handheld giggle camera.In a nutshell, avoid this film. It isn't funny, and it isn't interesting."
2,It's okay but,"Outside of the attractive girl on the cover, this film's storyline and substance left much to be desired. But I do commend the producers for getting it made."
4,Good book but maybe not what you expect.,I enjoy reading Mr.Salyes' books and this one is no exception. He easily one of the best current numismatic authors. This work does a great job of covering the types of counterfeits along with their history and an overview of how they are created. It is a very good book for anyone beginning to collect ancient coins. One thing the book is not is a catalog of counterfeits nor a guide on how to detect counterfeits. These subjects are beyond the scope of any general work and are dealt with by various numismatic associations and their publications. So if you are only looking for a manual or catalog move on.
3,definitely a worthwhile purchase if you're a fan of the gothenburg sound,"this is swedish melodic death metal in its purest form. completely metalcore free. it is true that there is absolutely no originality to this album, but if you're a fan of the gothenburg sound then you'll definitely dig this stuff. according to bnr, these guys have released atleast 2 albums after this one. kind of perplexed as to why amazon doesn't seem to carry either of them. would be interesting to see how their sound developed. oh well."
3,These socks...,"First of all, I have had these socks for almost 3 weeks. I am a part time banquet server and my feet get sweaty and im constantly on my feet. I have noticed that my feet ARE cooler, and sweat less in these socks. The feel of the socks on the other hand, the quality of the socks is ""eh."" For paying $12.99 for these socks I fail that I should get 2 pairs. The quality and make is not that great, I burn through socks (holes..) and these are already shedding after 3 weeks. Not worth the price."
2,As a sock these are interesting.. with the Vibrams I am not a fan,"This make the Vibrams fit too tight, and not to mention they are way over priced. As regular socks they are kinda cool"
5,Love them,"These are my preferred running and hiking socks...the best I've found for preventing blisters. They're not padded so I don't care for them when I'm going to be just standing a lot, like I do at work. But when running, I prefer blister prevention over sock padding."
4,Good For Vibram Five Fingers,These socks work good with Vibram Five Fingers. They are a little snug. Good product to help keep feet warmer in cold whether.
5,awesome socks,Most comfortable socks I've ever worn for running. Considering buying more to wear all the time for everything. Love these!
5,Best Socks Ever.,I got these socks mainly out of curiosity and also because I saw a lot of reviews from runners. I like to run but it's mainly while playing games like basket ball or soccer etc. and I wanted a sock that didn't slip around in the shoe or get completely soaked after a while. I really like the feel of the socks and they seem to work as described. They really keep my feet warm and dry. I think they look cool and they shipped really fast and arrived earlier than estimated. Great product.
5,Soft but yet tough,"The socks are pretty comfortable as they feel very soft, but yet look and feel very strong. Would have chosen the slightly longer pair if I had known that the Micro is very Micro."
5,Wonderful,"As soon as I put them on, I knew I needed to buy more. I've actually told three friends about them in the last two days. It's winter in New York, and they keep my feet really warm in men's dress shoes and at home by themselves. Buying more right now."
3,Nice socks with large toes,"I bought these socks through Amazon because I got Vibram fivefingers and couldn't find toesocks in any stores where I live (without socks I get blisters). They might seem a bit thick for some runners, but I like that. 'Small' fits my European size 36 feet well, but the toes are a bit too long and wide for me. The excessive fabric around the toes makes in somewhat difficult to put on the Vibram fivefingers, therefore only three stars. Still, I might have small toes, and if that is not your case, then these might be fine for you."
3,"Comfortable, but a bit big...","Having worn injinji toe-socks for over two years now, I have come to expect that the socks are originally a bit larger than needed, but shrink considerably after several washings;buy big, wash often, and eventually they will be the right size for your foot.If you buy the 'right' size out of the box, they will become too small and you will be stretching them out to fit onto your foot, which has to weaken the threads and cause them to wear out sooner than designed, and definitely sooner than desired.Unfortunately, I can't find any relevant competitors."
5,Fixed my running issue,I was having trouble with my pinkie toe painfully rubbing and these fixed the problem perfectly! I depend on them for my long runs.
4,Celebrate toe independence!,"I almost always run in Vibrams with no socks. But when I hit a rugged trail, I prefer a little more protection for my feetsies and wear a regular trail running shoe. My toes have become so independent in the Vibrams! I couldn't force them to get along all of sudden. Ininji socks helped me out! They feel good on the feet, the toes are happy, each snug in his little toe sack, not rubbing up against his brothers. Feeling good, blister free. I was a little surprised to see how quickly they wore through on my forefoot. . . . But I'll still buy them again. In fact, I bought two pair today while wearing one!"
2,it's okay,I thought this book would just give questions and let you answer but it's just a list that you check off. There is a note page in the back but was thinking more personal writting space.
3,Next step up,"this is a great set of tapes, but I was looking for a baby step or at least next step up from the silver series that I already was working with. This set says it is for beginners. Well, the beginners need to be in really good pyhsical shape. I have just begun yoga and felt it went a bit fast for me, but I am sticking to it because it is a good daily routine."
3,These are okay but not the best I've used.,These work nice for removing a motorcycle tire but aren't the best for mounting. I ended up using a big flat screw driver at the end. These tools get stuck between the rim and bead. I also should note that the plating on these tools falls off from scraping on the rim and it ends up in between the tire and the tube.
4,"NIce shoes, might not hold up after awhile","Nice shoes, but lack up support might not make them last after while, but nice design and concept. I get alot of compliments.BUT I would not order form footlocker again. They shipped these in a bag!? A shoe box in a bag?! By the time they got to me the box was totally crushed and not in any good condtion. BAD BAD SHIPPING I called footlocker and they could have cared less."
4,ok,"helps me with my cholesterol lowering, and I do not have to take the statins which is a great trade off"
2,Not a high ranked book on my shelf!,"The beginning of this book is a nice, calm, peaceful storyabout a boy interested in cartooning. But then the storychanges and is suddenly about a boy growing up, and goingthrough adolescence. I thought some chapters were verygross, and other chapters were just really scary and frightful.I am reading this book when I am eleven, and I think thatit is too old for me to read. It is about 13-15 year olds,and the problems and things people of that age group face scareme, or don't interest me. I don't really no whether to suggestor not to suggest this book, but I can say you should be olderthan 13 to read it, and you should be ready for a big changein plot in the middle of the book.-Katharine Manning, AmericanSchool In Japan, 6th grade."
2,Not what I was looking For,Very little punch and power to my existing system. Was looking for something with a bit more. Works better with my active pick ups than my passive but still not enough punch.
3,"decent info, terrible, grainy pictures","Terribly disapointed in the ultra-grainy pictures in this book. Maybe Im spoiled by my converted digital Canon XTi, which gets no graininess at all.... but the pics in this book are terrible. :-("
4,Great gift for a Scooby Doo fan,"Purchased this for my son for Christmas. He's 9 and got his first gameboy this past fall. The Scooby Doo Unmasked is working great for him, it's a little bit of a challenge-but not to the point of not being fun."
5,testdriver,"eareit is awesome!!!!!!!!there are 22 exciting events. you can pick your own car and track.my little brother plays it a lot,and so have I.I love this game and so will you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Transparent,"I found the plot of ""Ragtime in Simla"" to be fairly obvious very early in the book. In addition, the writing was not intellectually stimulating and the dialogue didn't strike me as being of either the period or the place.I had purchased this book because I had recently finished Laurie King's ""The Game,"" which takes place in the about same time period and vicinity. Since ""The Game"" was definitely 5 stars, I was anxious to prolong the atmosphere with another book of similar subject matter and location. Unhappily, ""Ragtime in Simla"" was the wrong choice and so disappointing that I won't bother with any of this author's other books."
3,It is a good movie but disturbing in some ways.,"I loved the movie but it was very graphic and wierd and uncomfortable. It was a very awkward movie because I watched it with my family. Bella was beyond belief ugly when she was pregnant with a vapire that it was hard to look at her and the whole time I felt bad for Jacob, Edward, the rest of the vampires and warewolves and ESPECIALY Bella's parents. I enjoyed watching this because I wanted to see a happy ending but all I thought about was poor Jacob and Bella's parents who love her so much and they will never see her again. I was sort of disaponted at the end because of all the awkward conversations and graphic scenes in this movie. And the fact that their was blood everywhere and it seemed like Bella was naked the whole entire time even infront of Jacob and Edward's famiily which I couldn't bare to watch. There were some really good parts but most of the movie disturbed me in some ways."
1,Akward: The Motion Picture,I saw this movie for fun but did not expect it to be the worst in every aspect. Everyone including main and supporting actors need to re- evaluate their acting abilities and I know it is not their fault to a degree but breaking dawn was super embarrassing and painfully hilarious to watch.
1,You can skip the first hour of the movie and not miss anything.,This movie took an hour to tell us that Bella and Edward got married.Then the next 45 minutes it told a cool story.
4,"for Twilight fans, obviously","I liked this movie because I enjoy the Twilight franchise. Those trying to watch this independently might not have the same feelings. It's incredibly cheesy and tremendously far-fetched, even considering the whole vampire/werewolf thing."
3,DVD,We have the previous movies in this series. My family is hooked on them. This product was shipped quickly and I can't wait for part 2.
3,Where are the special features?????,"This ""Special Edition"" is a waste of two discs. There are hardly any special features - just the commentary and a couple of featurettes. Oh yes, and that stupid ""Jump to"" Edward and Jacob feature that each movie has. I was looking forward to deleted/extended scenes and maybe some bloopers. I was extremely disappointed to find out there are none."
4,Good watch at a good price,It was fun to finally catch up with bella and gang. Cant wait for the second to come up for rental.
5,Love Twilight!,Saved money ordering it through Amazon. You can find just about anything on here! Loved the movie. Can't wait for the second part :-)
3,False Advertising?,"I am not here to write a review of the movie. I am here to sound off about false advertising from this distributor. Maybe it was a fluke or an oversite, but the ""prop flower"" that was suppose to be included was not. This is not a huge issue for me, but others may be really upset if they don't receive ALL the items that were advertised. It's the principal."
2,What was so special about this edition?,"I loved the books, and I really like the movies, but I can not believe the stuff that was missing from this release. No deleted scenes, a handful of interviews with the actors that we have all already seen on various interviews already released. Yes, I enjoyed the making of documentary, but felt very cheated that that was all! I will really feel ripped off if they release a bunch of deleted scenes and stuff with a boxed set when all the movies are released to DVD. I can understand holding some stuff back.....but none, come on!"
3,"Beware of ""rental versions"" from used / third party sources","In a very embarrassing move from Summit Entertainment, they released a separate ""Rental Version"" that not only removes special features, but also the HD audio. Be very wary if purchasing this disc used or from a third party. Personally I would assume it to be this ruined rental version unless they specifically state in their description or title that it is **not** the rental version."
4,Wife loves this movie.,My wife really loves this movie. She was really happy with it. The movie arrived quickly and with no damamge.
3,"Wasn't a fan, now I am",Was not a fan of twilight series until my boyfriend little brother took us to the movies. I had so many questions I brought all the movies and now I am very into the series. Considering even reading the book.
2,Special Edition? Really?,"I'm pretty bummed about this version, the special additions to this package do not include any extended scenes, outtakes, or deleted scenes.I don't think the promoters of the Twilight Saga truly understand the fans will buy the movie, on a simple disc with nothing else on it without marking it as Special Edition which insinuates there's something special, or different than the ordinary version?About the movie itself I give the MOVIE 5 *'s I think it's awesome. For those who hate it remember this is HALF the book. So we only got half the story it's a huge cliffhanger all that's missing is the ....to be continued at the end. Don't hate until you see the 2nd half.I'm for sure glad I preordered this at a discount, because had I paid full price I'd have been pretty peeved."
5,WOW....HOW AMAZING!,"i couldn't believe how much the actors have grown, the picture was excellent. one of my favorite scenes was when Jacob (taylor lautner) was communicating with the rest of the wolves, i was speechless. Overall it was the best of the saga not only the actors did an amazing Job, the director was a excellent chosen."
3,zzzz,"The movie seemed to drag on.Yeah the wedding was nice but the rest was a snorefest at least until the wolves went to do what I'm sure almost everyone else has wanted to do by now,kill that dumb broad.The next one should be better and if it's not,at least it will be the last.The whole story was not that bad but just get it over with already,it had way to much build up and kinda just didn't deliver.but that's just my opinion.Maybe part 2 will be better,there.'s suppose to be a big fight,yea! Now I'm really glad I waited to read the books cause that can make the movie seem lame if you read them first and this didn't need any help."
5,Twilight,This saga or series whatever you want to call it lol can't hardly wait to see it but I'm waiting for Amazon gives me the ability to advance purchase Awesome Sage ^_^
1,Breaking *YAWN*,"This must be one of the worst of the movie series. The movie needs to be renamed ""Breaking Yawn"". Go watch Kristen Stewart in Wonderland instead. Her performance was amazing in that much better movie."
3,The saga,"Out of all the twilight saga this was my least favorite, I am looking forward to Novenber 16th to see the last movie. I hope i won't b dessapointed."
3,What can I say...,"My teenage stepdaughter has a vampire phase and loves these movies... Oh well, she can watch them in her room.... I don't care too much for them, but seeing how popular they are I guess it's ok for teenagers..."
1,Sucked!!!!,"This movie regressed back to what the first movie was with a sappy, very cheesy, love story that is really boring. Hopefully the next one will get back to the fighting and action. That is the main reason, I personally, prefer the Underworld series to this series. Less love story. More action!!!! I would give this movie .25 of a star if I could."
1,Boring,"I really liked the first three Twilight movies. That's why this one was such a disappointment. It's incredibly boring. Nothing happens except a wedding, a honeymoon that took forever, talking wolves (cringe!) and a little confrontation at the end. This shouldn't have been a movie, but cut down into a few scenes and part of a bigger movie with more going on. Really disappointed I bought the DVD. Wait until it is bargain priced or buy it used, or just rent it and save your money, if you really want to see it to get the whole story. Not much ""story"" to get here except a few things, though..."
4,Good movie,"I wasn't ""over the moon"" with it but did enjoy it nonetheless. I didn't have to pause and do something else and come back to it. Plus i wanted to catch up so I can see the latest one out now. Overall, good movie, nice continuation of previous movies. For those that desire lots of action then you won't see that here - it's much more centered around character driven stories, love story and where that leads them. Great ending!!!"
5,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"This show was written very well. The cast were extremely capable in their performances and the special effects were terrific. A must see for any Vampire buff, which I am not, but worth watching just the same. Five Stars."
4,Laughing at society,"Ok seriously people its a vampire movie. Don't expect it to be great and don't expect it to be totally crap because you don't like the generation that is obsessed with it. It's just a vampire love story movie. There's nothing about it that deserves a page long review of why you love it or hate it. It's not going for an academy award. And seriously peeps if you thought it was fine but scared to say that please don't jump on the "" twilight is gay"" bandwagon."
3,Lacks Passion,"Am I the only one to think that this movie lacks passion. There is little to no chemistry between Bella and Edward. In general, I think the acting between the lead characters is lackluster and stiff. And the imprinting bit was ridiculous. I just wasn't impressed with this movie."
1,Disappointed,"As a true Twilight fan, it was hard for me to come away from this movie and admit disappointment. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing - or, should I say, WASN'T seeing. I found the whole thing to be benign and forced."
2,Why do we keep going to these films?,I have no clue why I let the hype get to me to watch this. Ugggh!!! The Book is sooooooooooooooooooo much better. Why are people buying this?
1,Kristen Stewart,This girl has absolutely no talent whatsoever. Her acting makes this awful movie even more unbearable. Do not watch this!
1,Disc didnt read,Disc didnt read....my blu ray player sounded liked it wanted to eat it and spit it out for hummus...nice gift for valentines days amazon...right on point...
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just want to say this is the best movie ever. And that it comes out February, 11, 2012 NOT 2011 as it says on the page."
1,Porn movies have better plots,All the girls that find this series makes them wet down under will all die alone surrounded by cats. I rather watch Newt Gingrich talk about the economy for 72 straight hours. On the bright side makes a good interrogation method for terrorist. Although it may be too inhumane.
5,Very good,I just learned that you can watch online movies through Amazon which is easy and awesome. Can't wait for part 2.
4,Convenience was perfect,I wanted to rewatch this movie before seeing the new one and the convenience of renting it on amazon fit my needs perfectly.
3,What A Saga,I was extremely happy with the price of my DVD especially as it was a two-disk special edition but unfortunately I have had to return it as it would not load.
1,Makes the first movie look like GONE WITH THE WIND!,"The TWILIGHT series is definitely a guilty pleasure -- at least, the first three books are, and the first three movies are at least fun, in a ""this is really stupid on screen"" way. I only WISH this had been so bad it was funny; I can always use a good laugh. But the movie BREAKING DAWN commits the worst sin there is for a movie: it's BORING. The wedding takes half an hour, the honeymoon seemed to take forever (and not in a good way), and the rest of it -- well, aside from counting the number of times the werewolves' ears flopped over (they do, really), it was so dull I kept falling asleep. Maybe I can save it and the forthcoming Part 2 for those nights when Sominex just doesn't do it."
4,"Good, but not the best.","As this movie series continues it seems as if everything gets better. With each new installment the acting, the graphics, and the script get better and come closer to the book. There were still some flaws, but over all it is better than the previous films."
2,Breaking Dawn Part 1,I only watched this because I heard Part II was very good. Part 1 was very boring and bad acting continued.
1,Don't waste your time.,The cardboard male and female are back...and still can't act. The only thing interesting are the werewolves...and the non-leading vampires.
5,Loved it!,"Loved the movie! Loved the whole saga!!! Definately glad I have the movies so I can watch them anytime, especially since the saga is over now"
5,Time has finally arrived,"I went to the midnight premier of Breaking Dawn part 1 and the movie was over in a flash. It was worth the wait and was well made. It was nice seeing Stephanie Meyer during the wedding. There are many high lights out of the book I was worried about (e.g. wedding night, birth, imprinting. All my worries were relieved, once I saw how great they were shown, especially after reading the books. I would like to go see the movie again. Now all us Twihards have to wait another year until the part 2 comes out. I would recommend this movie to anybody. Loved it"
3,Breaking Down,"Kind of slow, but that's how it usually goes when a book is broken into two parts (i.e. Harry Potter). The wolf pack graphics were kind of average...You could tell they were CG."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I started watching the movie on my computer and after about 30 minutes, it cut off. I could never watch the entire movie. Please don't waste your money on this product. I'll never buy another on-line movie!!"
1,No CC,It is extremely disappointing when the videos do not come with Close Captioning. It is difficult to show this the a group where close captioning is required for their understanding.
1,Sucks.,"I had the fan in place, the bios read its speed correctly, yet it never changed its speed. Its normal speed was so low that I couldn't even tell which way the air was flowing from it. I turned the fan around and it created the same airflow out the back of the computer. If you have a duo core processor, don't get this piece of sh**. An overclocked duo core @ 3.7ghz couldn't even get the fan to increase its speed. Avoid this fan like the plague"
2,Poor Product,Shipped quickly and was reasonably priced but the product itself was not what I thought it was going to be. It did not do nearly as much as I was hopping for. I would not make this purchase again. (not cause of the seller though =) they were great!
5,Great garden cart,"The cart was delivered promptly to my door. I put it together in about an hour, and it was ready to go. The huge wheels make it easy to travel over all the different kinds of terrain we have on the property. Having the dump feature with the sliding front panel is terrific.It's wider than my wheelbarro so it won't make it through a couple of my gates.I have to take the long way around to get to the side yard."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"THE CART IS WELL DESIGNED FOR LIGHT DUTY GARDEN DUTIES. I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THE SIDES AND BOTTOM WOULD LAST IF KEPT OUTSIDE OR HAULING WET OR DAMP MATERIAL. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY WIFE BECAUSE SHE ENJOYS WORKING IN THE YARD......IF THE CART WERE GOING TO BE FOR BOTH OF US TO USE, I WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE AND PURCHASED SOMETHING WITH A FIBERGLASS BED AND SIDES"
1,Terrible! It's the same as Cardio Dance Fusion!,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this! One reviewer already pointed out that this is the exact same workout as Cardio Dance Fusion, just with a different cover and title. I am disappointed that The Firm is so openly dishonest, greedy, and eager to fool their customers."
2,Trite,"Trite, pretty much sums up my feelings for this book. Kelson's saga deserves better... I got the distinct impression the author is tired of her character and wanted to tie up loose ends and be done with him. Kelson is my favorite character in the Deryni universe and I will continue to revisit the earlier novels, but not ""King Kelson's Bride""."
2,No excuse for this!,"A profound disappointment. This book reads more like an outline for a good series (say 3 novels). The story/plots moved way too fast and were shallow---very shallow. I am, frankly, surprised. Ms. Kurtz is an awesome story-teller. Can't imagine why she would turn out such work unless she was busy writing something else at the same time. I was hoping for King Kelson's Bride to be the first in a new series. I can only hope she refrains from this sort of writing for any future Deryni novels."
2,Hard Case Crime's weakest reprint yet,"While it's understandable that Hard Case Crime would eventually want to reprint a Hamilton novel due to his great successes in and out of the mystery field, Night Walker is just not up to par with previous titles in the publisher's catalogue.The story is slow, full of tremendous leaps in logic, and has areas of such lengthy exposition that the book grinds to a total standstill several times. The villain's explanation at the end of the novel, tying up every loose end of the plot, goes on page after page after page. The book also features a southern belle who starts nearly every bit of her dialogue with ""Well, I declare!"" Think I'm kidding? Count it up yourself, I bet she's got at least 100 ""I declares!"" in there. That's not characterization, it's just sloppy writing."
1,Ugh...Couldn't finish it,"By the time I got halfway through this book, I didn't care what happened next or at all to any of the characters in this book. It slogged along with no apparent direction. McDonald may be a terrific writer, but this effort sure couldn't prove it by me."
1,This is a review of the reviewers,"This is not a review of the book which I was contemplating buying, BUT! None of the seven ""reviews"" gives potential readers not familiar with the work of the author/photographer, any detailed information describing the of photos of the women? Are they poses for artists? Are the photos designed to sexually stimulate? Are they conservative or edgy? Are the women beautiful and highly sexual? Are they all in color? Are they large full page layouts?Seven reviews and all seemed to be clubby veteran readers of the author's books, preaching a choir, forgetting that those unfamiliar with this author/photographer want details and telling us that some landscapes are among the photos is of no consequence in deciding on a purchase of you are looking for specific information therefore it is a ""pig-in a poke.NOT helpful at all to the artist/buyer who seeks exotic/erotic posing ideas for paintings and pinups or for those who simply love to look at erotic beauties."
3,"Spiritual, reflective book not technical","This is a decent book mainly looking at the more internal process of self-development on the path of Orixa. At times it skirts close to new-ageism and spiritualist type beliefs or statements but not so much that I cringed. However, hearing about the path of Orixa from a feminist was refreshing and interesting. I would not reccommend this book if you want detailed info about each Orixa, practises etc. This is not what this book aims to do. There is a good bibliography and glossary and interesting information about establishing an ancestors altar, how to maintain and feed the dead. This book is more about inspiration in practise and maintaing mindfulness and focus on this path."
5,AM review,"I bought this as a gift, but I'm sure that it is a great book as I have read many Andrew Murray books & they are all very good."
4,Good for the Knee,We bought our first set when my wife tried the ones my brother had. I then tried hers and bought a pair for myself. They really help.
2,Not worth the effort,"This book is billed as a suspenseful novel about Lizzie Borden. The only suspense I felt was in trying to stay awake. The book was incredibly boring, none of the characters were sympathetic, just pathetic."
5,Great product!,"I just received this product yesterday...it is the best! It kept me oil free all day! Usually I am very oily on my nose and forehead by mid-day, but today I stayed shine free until I washed my face before bed!Great product for oily skin!"
5,Perfect for me!!!!,"I have extremely oily skin. I would put on my make-up and about 30 minutes later, my face would look like I had vaseline on my face. This is the first product that actually does what it says it will do. At first I didn't want to try it due to the price. After reading the reviews, i gave it a try and I am glad that I did. The bottle is not that small and you really don't need that much. I use it as a primer for my press powder and throughout the day all I really had to do was blot instead of washing my face and starting over. This is great!!!!!!"
2,Meat Band Saw Review,"For the price, I found the saw decent. The blade tended to not cut straight and would tend to angle off to the side with meat that was almost frozen."
5,Hula Workout,"This is absolutely, hands down the most fun I have ever had in an exercise routine. I just love all of the Island Girl fitness videos and bought everyone that Kili made, for variety, you can't beat it. You have fun doing the Hula and don't hardly even realize that you're exercising. It's great!!!"
2,Not Very Good.,"My daughter has been taking Polynesian dance lessons for the past six years. I was looking for a fun exercise video that I could also learn to Hula. The quality of production for this video was excellent, but the actual ""dance"" was not fun or what you would expect of a ""hula"" dance. The music was like a very boring, slow version of tahitian drumming and the moves were more athletic (not graceful). If you are looking to learn a more traditional hula along with listening to beautiful traditional hawaiian music, this video is NOT for you...or anyone else I know. In my opinion, as a veteran ""Hula Mom"", this was a total waste of money. I should have done a little more homework checking out this teacher, but I had only relied on the previous review that I read from Amazon.com. This video was a big disappointment."
3,"Cute, but not very helpful...","The art in this book is adorable, there's not denying that, but it's not very helpful for anything other than putting a smile on your face. There's next to no instruction of any kind, and what's there is almost incomplete and completely unhelpful for anyone that doesn't already have a fair degree of skill already. This is great for suggestions, and will probably help with a few details that you might have been leaving out of your chibi drawings, but it's not helpful for much of anything else."
2,Needs better treatment,The film deserves a better DVD package; this one offers a somewhat dark transfer and no extras at all and comes at a high price for such a no frills disc.
4,Brown GIrl's Silence Speaks UP,"A terrifically heartwarming story about a young girl's coming of age as first generation American from Barbados. The ""silence"" of Marshall's main character, Selina, resounds in this coming of age child of immigrants tale unfolds. Partially based on Ms. Marshall's own life, the story holds warmth, humor and tragedy for almost anyone willing to explore the human condition.A definite must-read for post-modernists."
5,Great Lives Lived,"A classy, authoritative British anthology demonstrating that obituary writing is best delivered by the anonymous, omniscient instant biographer."
5,Glamorous,"This is a great product, much more glamorous than that seen on the photo. Would recommend anyone who is interested to buy one. I am totally satisfied with the necklace"
4,"Probably the least orange among ""cheap"" self-tanners, but I don't like the glitter.",I like this product for the price. It's good to use during the summer when you have a tan already and helps even out my freckles. The glitter is a bit too much and makes me feel like a teenager. It's a little on the orange side but not as bad as some of the cheap self-tanners. Overall OK. I think I'll stick to my other more expensive product-Sun Laboratories.
3,"Does the job, but...","I am a first time user of this product. I usually use a Jergen's self tanner, but the store was out the last time I went in, so I decided to try this, because it had both a bronzer and self tanner.I will start off by saying I am extremely fair skinned, and found this went on easily, doesn't seem to be streaky (the bronzer helps with making the application even), and it smells very nice after developing. I usually can't stand how most self tanners smell after they develop. It did make me a little rashy, but not itchy.That being said, I had no idea beforehand about the glitter. I put it on, and noticed right away that there seemed to be reflective, glittery speckles everywhere. I feel like a tanned Twilight vampire. It's a little weird.I will finish my bottle, but will probably switch to something else next time."
1,Too glittery,"I cannot comment on the tan this product may or may not give, as I am instantly turned off by the glitter! I thought maybe it would wear off, but hours later I am still sparkling. Maybe ok if I'm going out on the town, but for the most part I'm just throwing on a pair of jeans and off to run errands - so I look like I'm trying to be all fancy at the grocery store and such. Not for me!"
5,Kitty crack!!,"I don't know what they do to this food but my cats act like maniacs when I put it out. I only give it to them a few times a week (I give them a variety of dry food) and they get so excited when they get this kind. I normally avoid dyed food but my cats love this so much I enjoy giving it to them. They get other ""healthier"" types of food along with it so I am not concerned. Their little lives are too short to not get food that they truly love and my cats ALL love Fancy Feast dry and wet. Indulge your babies in a little junk food on occasion, it won't hurt anything. I have a little junk food myself sometimes cause it makes me happy, too. :)"
3,humming bird feeder,I like very much the appearance of this feeder and it is attracting hummers but I have trouble with air in the feeding tube even though I completely fill the feeder . How do I solve this problem ?
1,Zero stars wasn't one of the choices.,"The secret to reading this book is to ignore his superfluous NOTEs and footnotes. Quite frankly, there isn't anything here that you probably haven't figured out on your own working with a database. I love to read, but I must admit that this is the only book that actually makes me drowsy in 2 pages flat."
3,"Good, not great.","The first Bal Ganesh was (is) a great animated movie. Little kids like it because of the catchy tunes and dance sequence. The traditional Hindu story of origin and exploits of Ganesh is well told. Adults not familiar with Hindu mythology will find it instructive as well as entertaining. This sequel, Bal Ganesh 2, is not nearly as coherent. It uses a bunch of really corny mice doing song and dance to tie the stories together. This is not very successful. If you haven't seen the first one, get it now. If you really love it and must have all Bal Ganesh output, then get Bal Ganesh 2."
3,Cute,A nice quiet Sunday afternoon kind of movie. I liked the different spin played in this romantic comedy.
4,Better than Expected,"I was expecting Cinderella, and this film delivers. Cinderella is in the form of a pre-med in Wisconsin, played by down-to-earth Julia Stiles. When the Prince of Denmark (no not Hamlet) flies to America looking for girls he imagined to be like wild girls, he sets his sights on Julia. Completely different than any girl he has ever met, Julia soon teaches the irresponsible prince a lesson about growing up and finding love. Beautifully romantic if you love princess movies, but updated with modern concerns. Reminds of a few good princess books/movies: Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Diary of a Discount Donna, Pretty Woman, and Ever After."
4,Okay but not the best messages,"Watch this in a double feature with ""What a Girl Wants"" and ask yourself which young woman will be happier in the long run. (Add ""Mona Lisa Smile for a triple-bill.)The message that true love can wait and does not need to be hurried is a good one, but the plot postpones the inevitable trade-off that the main character has to make between her own identity and becoming queen."
2,"You could watch this movie, but why would you?...","By all means, if you really have to kill 2 hours of your life, you can watch this movie. Then again, there are more exciting things to do in life,... such as watch the grass grow, watch the paint dry,... you get the idea.I can not say it was that bad, but it was certainly not a comedy, or drama, or anything else. It was just a movie, which is perhaps the worst part about it. You really get the sense that you were watching something entirely made up that did not resemble reality in any way, shape or form."
5,Simply adorable!,"Really cute movie... Their chemistry is great.Yes, it's predictable, but if you're just looking for an escape, this is a perfect choice!Enjoy!"
5,Great Follow -Up,"This book is an excellent follow-up to Hinds Feet on High Places. The reader followes Much-Afraid, now Grace-and-Glory on her continued mission: to bring her family into the service of the Shepard. A definate must read for those who have read the above book, if for nothing else, to give direction and encouragement with their new life in Christ."
2,Is it 1935 or 1965?,"Ever heard the expression, ""Every thief wants to get caught""? Well, seems like every set designer/costumer wants to let us know what time it REALLY is. While this rags-to-riches story is set in Depression-era hollywood, its visual aesthetic lives in the future. Imagine Shirley Temple in go-go boots, mod nickers, and a leather Oliver Twist cap, and you've got a good idea of what to expect. Bouncing off the lip-glossed-over plot are startling performances by Robert Redford (for once he's a bad boy) and Ruth Gordon (she's not so cuddly here, either). A mature Natalie Wood not only goes from rags to riches, she goes from pre-teenhood to washed-up adulthood in one frenetic, teary-eyed swoop. Particularly striking is this dark musical's number, ""The Circus is a Wacky World."" Clowns and nickers galore!"
4,The Movies Are A Wacky World,"The star system of the 30's on trial. See a close paralell of Natalie Wood's rise to stardom in Hollywood, get a fascinating look at how deal's are really made, and answer the magic question of whether you can really fit a producer's heart into a thimble. This is a bittersweet tale, and the moral of the story is if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. A fascinating watch."
3,Pleasant to follow once learned,"Generally this is an enjoyable exercise to learn, although I do agree with an earlier reviewer in that the backgrounds are exceedingly distracting.The best advice I have in that regard is to learn the exercises and then close your eyes to rely on David Carradine's wonderful voice."
4,great service,"After I did not receive my converter the first time and it got sent back. These folks called me back for another address they could send it to to make sure I got it, free of charge. Sending it twice cost them a lot more, but it was great customer service and I thank them. Haven't had the converter long but it seems to be working as advertised, can't say the same for the batter saver..."
3,Good concept,"I bought this for my 3-year-old when he began to have problems winding down. Now, the age range is 3-8, so I knew I was at a cusp, but it was much too complicated for him to follow. He did enjoy the stories and visualizations, but the physical stretching/breathing was more challenging than soothing for him.I do like the book; it just wasn't what he needed at that time. I do think it could be useful if he has issues when he's a bit older or possibly for a sibling, so I'm hanging on to it. If I use the technique more fully in the future, I'll update the review."
5,A must-have for aficionados!,"This was a wonderful purchase. I am addicted to the Sherlock Holmes series with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Thank heaven there are people who work to restore these classics and make them available on DVD. This was an exciting purchase, because I thought I had seen all the Rathbone movies, but these two were new to me! ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death"" became an instant favorite, which I watched three times the first day. Keep bringing the classics on, please! A+ to this purchase."
4,Another proud addition to the BFI series.,"The BFI sometimes pick the wrong writer to cover certain films for their Film Classic series. Anne Billson is one of the better writers. She doesn't confuse the reader and covers the film from start to finish. The only draw back is that it does sometimes seem that she is just recounting the story, using her own words to add tension, but she does make up with some interesting commentary."
2,Disappointed...,"When I was born, in 1979, my mother used an older edition of this book for me. My step-mother also used an edition when my sister was born in 1988. Both are books were very similar with a nice hardcover.This new edition is missing a lot of information the older ones had, such as places to write in important milestones for babies. It's still one of the best out there and I'll buy it again for our second child. I'm also not fond of the three-ring binder setup. I preferred the old hardcover, as it wasn't as bulky.As for Amazon saying they can get the older version is just a few weeks, those few weeks turned into months and I gave up."
3,Box came damaged - supposedly new,"I bought this DVD set as a gift for a friend. I have ordered several things from Amazon.com before without any problems when purchasing a new item. For what was supposed to be a new item, the DVD set that I received in the mail was damaged! I was and still am disappointed."
4,Beautiful but...,"...hard to clean. I had such high hopes for these jars. They are lovely as cannng jars go do not get me wrong however, I had not taken into consideration how difficult they would be to clean. This is more my own issue than the jar's really. I did not even think about it when I bought them. That said, I would buy them again just for their looks. They make great gifting jars."
1,Reniged on a Contest,"They held a contest for up and coming musicians for a spot on the sound track of this movie and reniged. Never announced a winner ~ It's a shame that they can produce a movie about music and advertise a contest and then sweep it under the rug. My friends and family are boycotting based on their deceit alone!i have proof that the contest stated the winner of the big break contest will be on the dvd [...] This needs to be fixed asap. the girl in the video says the winner WILL be on the dvd!! just watch the video and listen!!Alexa Vega - Big Break Music Contest[...]Big Break is in association with Broken Hill, an upcoming film. It is a free contest where you can enter to win cash prizes and have your music placed on the....."
3,Could have been better,"I picked this video from a shelf of several Tai Chi exercise videos because of the familiar face and the mystique surrounding David Carradine. He seems stiff, and not confident in (or very familiar with) the motions.I keep trying to watch Arnold Tayam behind David because his movement is so beautiful, but I get frustrated whenever the camera isn't pointed at him. Arnold also does a beautiful sequence of movement at the end of the video filled with exercises that are not covered in the instruction.I was hoping to be introduced to the philosophy and symbolism involved with Tai Chi, but it wasn't covered here.I agree with another reviewers comment about difficult camera angles some times making it hard to follow, but you can eventually get it.Still its nice to exercise to, and I feel pretty good when I do. I am going to read reviews of as many Tai Chi, taijiquan, qigong videos as I can to find some that will work better for me."
2,Not all I was hoping for,"Was disappointed in this video, as it contains very little actual work-out time. Also, the first of the two work-outs wasn't sufficiently challenging, & the second, while more challenging, was impossible to follow (half the movements aren't explained, & the camera angle changes too often)."
2,Eh...,I thought this product was going to be moist. It arrived so dry and dusty it got everywhere when I opened it. When I did add it to a terrarium it bled green everywhere. It also would float on top of the water bowl if my frog traced it in there.
4,my new anti-drug,"OK, so I'm not good at traditional video games. Actually, it would be fair to say that unless it involves pressing the same button over and over again, I'm really bad.This, however is a lot of fun, and doesn't require skill pushing buttons, ""just"" singing.Lots of great songs, and levels from ""easy"" to ""hard"" make this a fun party game, as well as a challenge to someone who enjoys singing."
5,So much fun for my 8 year old & the whole family,My husband and daughter love these game. The song selection is great. A lot of fun!
5,pennis enlargement,i would like this book to include side effects and otherwise of enlarging ones pennis. i would like among others the book to include other means of payment when necessary especially for people in countries that do not operate master cards and vcards. people in third world countries that can only afford to pay in their currencies that is if you have an affiliate bank through which we can pay in our local currencies.also he book should make details of people who have done and have cause to encourage others to do same
5,Loved It,"Very pleased with the book. Thank you it seemed to take a while but I was just so anxious to receive this very special book.Thank you again,"
5,sometimes nothin' else will do,"If you haven't used a pass-through socket wrench, you're making some situations way too hard for yourself. And, this set a very good one for the price."
4,Gear Ratchet Vortex Socket,"I just purchased these tools and they seem to be a very good deal considering they have a lifetime warranty. As you would guess by the price these tools are made in China. If you're like me most of my tools are made in the USA, Germany or Japan. These tools are perfect for the average handyman. I'm not sure if I would use these everyday considering the metal on the socket walls are relatively thin. The concept and design is fantastic and ergonomics and balance are good. If you're planning on using these everyday, I'd probably opt for Snap On, MAC or Hazet tools. The fine tooth ratchet mechanism is good but not sure how durable it is. For the money you could by 2 or 3 sets when compared to Snap On. If you still have doubts and are on a budget just run to Sears and get some Craftsman, you won't be disappointed."
3,Adventurer with a Bad Attitude.,"Jon Turk gives us insight into his life of obsessive wanderlust coupled with a dysfunctional personnal life. The redeeming elements include a taste of the risk involved in his expeditions,his historical knowledge of the indiginous people/ former explorers and his awakening to the quality of his girlfriend, Chris. (She put up with a lot of his crap) Unfortunately, this is contrasted by his repetitive and eventually predictable impatience with which he approaches each expedition. His relationship with his children and female companion(and eventual wife)reveal his ""me first"" affliction.I think the book would have been more interesting if he limited the comings and goings of all his children and focussed on more of the technical aspects of his expeditions.During one part of his dogsled journey, his expedition companion leaves him to return home. I think I would have been on that bandwagon, myself."
3,A reference book written in the 50's for the expectant mother.,This book was written by Nicholson J. Eastman and is used as a reference book to guide the expectant mother.
1,How Could My Life in the NKVD Be So Misunderstood?,"Previous reviewers of this book exclaim, ""What a wonderful tale, straight from the finest experiences of the human drama!"" Yeah, right. Martin Gray would have you believe he was up to his knees in corpses at Treblinka, when in reality he was serving as an officer in the Soviet NKVD. Once again, we find the ""most touching remembrances of the Holocaust"" to be fiction."
5,Lawn Mowing et al,Pollans description of what is a green thumb and the sysiphean art of mowing reminded me how therapeutic gardening can be and why it cures depression. Thank you Michael for making me look at my roses in a totally different way. You will love this book if you tend to think in pictures and love the art and hard work of gardening.
4,A great read for a gardener or philosopher,"I've just started gardening and a friend gave me this book. I'm a fan of some of Pollan's later books and thoroughly enjoyed this. It's a one part personal memoir, two parts philosophical musings about nature, and a smidge of good gardening advice thrown in to boot. I'd like to see it updated a bit since times (and organic gardening) have changed somewhat- but regardless, it stands up excellently and is well worth the read."
2,Pollans least interesting work,"I have read most of Michael Pollans books. I think 'The Omnivores Dilemma' is a five-star plus book that should be mandatory reading for everyone who eats, and 'In Defense of Food' is almost as good.In this book, Michael talks about his efforts at gardening, both vegetables and ornamental plants. However, this book disappoints. It is too vague, with few concrete examples to back up his assertions. It seems that Michael is a better writer about other peoples efforts at producing food than he is on his own efforts."
2,A Disappointing Beginning!,"While some of the other movies in The Bible Series have been magnificent, this particular one falls short, and was very disappointing. Although the music is very period-like for the era, the program is confusing in its depiction of Adam and Eve and the serpent. What was intriguing, however, was the concept of Eve not being Caucasian. In that part of the world (Middle East), it would only stand to reason that Eve would be a woman of color. Then things moved quickly to Noah, and another very disappointing scene. The ark didn't even look like the historical ark, and those who entered the ark looked like the entire neighborhood. Not a very good depiction. The rest of the movie was a little bit forgettable."
2,It's just a story,"For the most part what we all already know, just more fetails to the story. Not thrilled with it. It came in the set, but I wouldn't buy it individually"
1,Genesis - a nomad's tale,"I completely agree with McNamara's review. This is more a narrative with pictures than a dramatic film. For dramatization, try 'The Bible ... in the beginning' by J. Huston or 'Noah', from the BBC's 'Bible in animation' series. It is incongruous to depict the Creation and paradise in an almost desert environment. The film 'drags' slowly through the stories we know so well from the Book of Genisis. There are some redeeming features however. Some of the filming is very artistic, with some stunning visuals. I believe that E. Morricone composed the score for the film. You will be treated to wonderful back-ground music, with a middle-east flavour."
2,Just what I needed -,"I thought I finally found the perfect cell phone accessory - a battery with a belt clip; not one of those cheap after-market kits that are sold everywhere.My only dissapointment was in finding out that while the clip worked great, the battery wouldn't hold a charge.Let's see if the replacement works better.Stay tuned . . ."
4,Lexus floor mats.,So far so good. They are not heavy duty but work fine. Would be better if they had grommets so the floor holders in the car could be used. I had to put heavy duty velcro on the car floor to hold them in place so they would not slide forward. Not like Lexus OEM but serviceable.
2,sturdy but not sturdy,"I was delighted at the sturdy construction of this product when it arrived. However, within just 20 minutes of gentle play use in my nursery school class, BOTH doors broke off because they are attached with weak lightweight dowels. To ship it back would be cost-prohibitive for me so I will repair it myself using a sturdier hinge... very frustrating. Besides that, it is adorable, and hopefully with the repair will last years in my classroom."
2,Cool toy but brakes way too easily,"The mailbox is neat but not very sturdy. Just like the other reviews, both doors broke off without excessivly rough play within DAYS. More disappointing to me is that we called the 1-800 number for Melissa and Doug about this and got NO reply. If you aren't going to field and address questions or concerns, don't print the number Melissa and Doug!"
2,"We like Melissa & Doug, but were disappointed by this item","Our previous experience with Melissa & Doug products has been pretty good, but the quality control team was asleep on this particular item. The locking mechanism for the door does not operate smoothly and requires a key to turn; it would have been better to have a knob for smaller fingers and as a backup once the key inevitably gets lost. It seems as if the thickness of paint was not accounted for in the design, because all of the pieces fit tightly until your kid wears the paint off the corners. The thickest envelopes that can only go in the top slot hit the back of the box before dropping down, so your kid really has to shove them through; ours splintered the inside face of the fiberboard around the slot within a day. After one week of use, some of the seams between panels on the mailbox are already cracked and chipping. Our kid really wanted a mailbox, but we now wish that we had chosen a different brand."
1,My first and last Coulter experience,"I, like others here, feel compelled to finish any book I begin, but this is one that makes me seriously rethink that comittment. Others have duly noted the multitude of flaws in the plot, but what really got to me was the insipid dialogue. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THIS! Virtually every time a character opens his or her mouth, what comes out sounds like something that would earn a generous D in a high school creative writing class. I guess I should have been alerted by the ""Dear Readers"" note on the back cover of the paperback edition. I know this was probably written by someone working for the Publisher, but didn't Coulter have to sign off on something over her signature? When an author tells me her book ""will keep me on the edge of my seat,"" and promises to I'm not smart enough to solve her ""surprise"" ending, I should know well enough to keep my wallet in my pocket. Oh well, fool me once ..."
1,So bad I had to keep putting it down!!,"First of all, if this is one of Catherine Coulter's ""best"" novels, it will be the only one I ever read. I found the character, Ramsey, to be especially unbelievable. He was one minute a strong, macho man--and then the next a man who wanted french-braiding lessons PLEASE!!!!!! I had trouble finishing this book because it was so ridiculous!"
1,awful,"While I have read many of Ms. Coulter's books, this one was definitely a stinker. I can't believe anyone who is a discerning reader will find this book well done. Quite frankly, this book did not even strike me as having been written by this author, but rather by someone who wished they could write. It was amateurish in its dialogue, silly in its plot and character development, and just a plain waste of time. I ended up skimming over so much of it, and I was still able to figure out the entire plot by just briefly scanning over every 2-3 pages. I know not every book is a bestseller, but the publisher certainly was trying to pull something over on its readers with this one. Shame!!"
1,Not worth wasting one's time reading.,"I have enjoyed ms. coulter's contemporary works in the past, but this one sounded as if some of her helpers wrote the book. The dialogue was amateurish, the plot poorly paced, and skimming every other right-handed page more than allowed the reader to figure out what was taking place."
2,Wanted to Like it,"I really wanted to like this book. The plot was unrealistic in so many areas, but I might have been able to suspend disbelief if the dialogue would have been better. Six year old children, even advanced child proteges, simply do not converse like Emma, especially after the trauma she endured in this novel."
3,"Interesting premise, but I wanted more.","I was expecting a novel like THE COVE and THE MAZE. Was I ever surprised and a bit disappointed! Ramsey and Molly are likeable and seem compatible, but the suspense of the other two novels just wasn't there. Emma did not seem like any 6 year old I've ever known. I read it, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it."
2,Not worthy to put Catherine Coulter's name as the author,"I have read 20 or so, C. Coulter novels and The Target was a study in frustration and disappointment for me. The dialogue was trite and seemed fragmented and disjointed. Sometimes I wasn't even sure who was speaking or what they were talking about. The storyline started out good but got lost in unbelievable situations. The characters were likeable but lacked depth and history. I was very sorry I spent 18.00 on this book and will read several critical reviews before I buy another contemporary suspense novel by Coulter. The Cove and The Maze were much better. She should stick to historical romance-she's much better at it."
3,Its alright.,"This is a great CD. For all of you who appreciate the art of music in all its various artistic forms, whether old, classical, vintage, or new …it’s all food for the heart, body, mind and soul. You will appreciate this material. Thanks"
5,B.C.Classic,"""Enta Da Stage"" contains dark, brooding production and a formidable B.D.I. emcee by the name of Buckshot,and his partner 5 Ft. emcee, who juggled incarceration and the recording of this album. ""Enta Da Stage"" embodies the magical synergy that the Bootcamp Clik exhort when paired with Da Beatminerz, and it is a representation of the Clik's homegrown aesthetic of ""keepin' it real"" with tims on at all times (yeah, I know, the contemporary cliche but it is certainly pertinent when one is discussing the B.C.C). This album plays out like chapter one of a B.C.C. saga, lasting until the release of O.G.C.'s Da Storm. Since the advent of that album, it is clear that the Clik have chosen a new artisic direction being virtually devoid of any participation from Da Beatminerz. That being said, ""War Zone"" is a very worthy follow-up to this classic album, and both are my recommendations."
5,sick,"this album is a must have for any eastcoast hiphop fan. this album is raw and rugged. it has that real primal beat feel, evident of where their from. these guys are some of the best emcees to come out of brooklyn. i cant pick a favorite song their all good if you like duckdown or the boot camp click this is a must have, hell this is a must have anyways."
5,Would make a great Mini-Series,"This book was fantastic. One of those books you don't want to put down. Great descriptions of the accounts of the main character make you feel like you are there. And the stories... Good thing it is only a book. I don't know how one man could have gone through all of that.The ""rhythm"" of the story was in such a way that at points you say, ""What's this all about,"" then before you know it, it is all tied back into the story line. Wow. What a wild ride. I will have to check out other works by this author."
4,2 b sides and 2 new songs were enough for me to buy it,"This is a good collection, though already owning all of their CD's and singles, I only bought it for the two new songs and to have the Foxes and West of London Town B-sides on CD. Master of the World and Maryare incredible, and I'm looking forward to the rumored Trevor Tanner solo album from which they came. Also rumors of a New Bolshoi album called Overdriver 2000, but who knows? Anyway if rumors are true, and you buy this CD, you are buying it only to have the two B-sides, for everything else on here is re released by Beggars Banquet (and available here at Amazon), or will be released soon when (if) the Master of the World CD comes out."
5,The sinister perspective!,"Under the light of more than seventy three years elapsed, we should assume another perspective at the moment to consider its relevant significance. James Whale was the acclaimed director of Frankenstein and Claude Rains (Notorious and Casablanca) make the best they can in which to put asunder the phantasmagoric and the incisive metaphor beneath the script.A true milestone of the cinema. For many modernists it may be dated, but nobody will be able to deny that in 1933 this must be a horror film in the broad sense of the term."
2,Depressing,"I must say that I couldn't finish this book, because I found reading it so unpleasant. I generally love the classics and have a high tolerance for slow, plodding books, but I found this one painful.I understand that we should allow Lawrence a different standard for his portrayals of Mexico and ""natives"" since he was writing before our contemporary multicultural awareness. Nevertheless, I would expect insightfulness in his portrayal, whereas I found a simplistic racism. Had I finished the book, perhaps I would have found that he had more to say than what I have gleaned so far- that Mexico and Mexicans are evil, reptilian, and hopeless. That message was so repetitive that I had to give up on the book in order to save myself from the dark mood of the whole reading experience."
2,The filter gets moist,"Gets wet whenever I go through a car wash; the set-up doesn't have the same protection against water that the stock air box does. Whenever it does get wet, the filter drys quickly though. Has sort of a whistle when I hit the high rpms. Didn't notice any performance gain."
5,Rekindle your love of lettuce!,"After the surrealists and dadaists of the twentieth century, along with their more prosaic postmodern followers reduced art to the level of nonsense, it was inevitable that the Colonel would come along and raise nonsense to the level of art. As Einstien pointed out ""if Baxter didn't exist it would be necessary to invent him."""
5,Entertainment at it's NORDIC BEST!,"The boys from Monte Python have done it! After reading this book, I was thoroughly satisfied. I don't know what I expected to find within, but the impulse buy was worth it. The illustrations are lovely, and the stories are filled with meaning that you will carry with you always. The tales weave into each another to make on big journey. Each ends up with a moral, therefore making it important for children AND adults to read (since we seem to thinkg growing up means to forget childhood ""lessons""). Learn them again with this pleasing book, it will keep you fingering through the pages until there are no more."
4,Good introduction to lesser known mythologies,"This is a good set of stories about Erik's voyages and adventures. Oral traditions of these stories are blatenly obvious, but help younger readers follow the stories. These stories will make great bedtime stories or beginning reader stories. The lessons are timeless and will surely get any child interested in reading more about mythology or the Vikings."
5,This is one very good book.,"Written by ex-Monty Python member Terry Jones, it tells the tale of a Viking named Erik, who, with his men, goes on a quest to find the land where the sun goes at night. It is involving, exciting, well written, and great reading for all ages. I highly recommend it."
3,just couldn't get it working.....,"I loved the concept and tried to execute, but couldn't get it all together. I don't know if it was something I did, or the software itself, but never got it to work. I tried the ""blue"" software free download and I loved that, but never got this working yet. I'm going to tackle it again sometime -- could be user error, but not that simple to use initally."
2,Its really about common sense,"This book was a waste of time to read. It comes down to this, eat sensibly and in moderation, exercise and the weight should come off. If you only have 10 pounds to loose, I wouldn't recommend it. It seems like this book is geared torwards people who have a lot of weight to loose. If I followed this diet, I would be famished. Eat when you hungry, why wait for the ""miracle"" three hour? I just don't get it. I think the book was also more about joining Jorge's website."
5,Buy It!,"If you are uncertain about buying this book, just take a look at how many people have given this book 5 stars. I have read self-help books before and found most of them to be full of it. Dr. Ellis really has something here. This is a book that can really help you. It has really helped me. I know it may be hard to believe that a book can improve your life but the ideas in this book did just that. If you're not familiar with REBT,you will be after reading this book. It is a simple technique that you can apply to anything that is bothering you about yourself or your life. It's helps you to work on your thoughts. And no, it's not easy, it takes work, but it is possible. I have bought this book several times always to give it away to someone else. Also if you are not into sappy sob stories than this is a good book."
2,A bit disappointed,"I was disappointed when I got the book and looked through it. Nowhere on Amazon did I find the disclaimer that was in the book. This is published as a print on demand and has ALOT of typos and gibberish where the computer could not pick up the words. The company claims that this is to keep costs low, but I paid a good amount for this book. I was excited to find this title because I had looked before and never found it recently published. The typos are going to make it hard to read and took a lot of the enjoyment out of the book for me."
1,Less Then Zero,"I must have missed something, considering the amount of praise heaped on the author on the dust jacket, I thought I was about to read War and Peace. There was nothing new here, and the story line moved around like a heart monitor display - no consistent track - grabs something here, something there. This really is a very disappointing book."
4,Lots of detail on coldwater fish,"No tropicals were mentioned, which was fine with me since I have plenty of books about tropical fish. I was looking for a pond fish guide, and this was perfect."
5,The most essential electro bass album you've never heard of,"Unfortunately, this appears to be out of print as of the date of this writing(sun. june 10th 2001). This album is in the same vein as any electro-bass/brkbt/great you'd care to name(bambaataa,kraftwerk,anthony rother,dynamix 2 et. al).I can testify to this only because i found a cassette copy at one of those used cd/cassette joints in hollywood bch."
5,Great Read!,"This was one of the most refreshing books I have read in a long time. The characters were real and I was not only able to visualize them but I was able to identify with their circumstances. Mr. Simpson takes you on a journey of real life, and keeps your mind working. It was hard to put it down , very easy read and fast paced.I can't wait until the next book!!!!"
5,About time!,Absolutely wonderful collection of Mel Brooks best. Wouldn't have it any other way. This is a real bargain and I've already blitzed through most of the movies.
