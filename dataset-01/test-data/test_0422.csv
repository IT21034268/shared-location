5,Great toy for a litter!,I bought this for a litter of Collie puppies and it was such a hit that we ordered another one. They love to find the squirrels and play tug of war with them and the trunk... the puppies are all grown and after a trip through the washer/dryer the toy is still in great condition; no rips or anything.
4,fun for dogs who love to find things!,"I got the Jumbo hide a squirrel for my german shepard for christmas, and he likes it. He likes to pick up the log part and swing it around to see if the squirrels will come flying out. Every now and then, I also find a stray squirrel hidden in my bed too. haha"
4,"Chipmunks, really.","Great pet toy, and very cute. However, these squirrels look more like chipmunks to me. The dog does NOT seem to care what I call these critters. Well worth the price."
2,Does not hold up for that long,"I purchased this item as a christmas gift for my 6 month old puppy(catahoula/lab). After she got it on christmas day she immediately started to rip the tree apart. The squirrel's lasted about a week more, but she eventually tore them open as well and got all of the stuffing out. This item in my opinion is good for a smaller dog who is not out to rip and tear everything apart. My puppy was not interested at all in seeking the squirrel's out from inside the tree."
2,Easily figured out,This toy is very cute but it took my two 8 month old lab mix puppies about 15 minutes to pull out the pieces. I was a little disappointed it was not too much of a challenge.
3,Love it but labs will tear it up,"Look I love to watch my lab with the bees, in fact, I bought it two years ago and I am buying it AGAIN! Again, because she, being a lovable lab, tore it apart within a couple of weeks. But she LOVED it as we did watching her. This will actually be the third time to buy it. When she puts it in her mouth and gives a good shake the bees go flying, she goes chasing and we laugh like crazy. So funny! In fact the kids and I were just talking about how much fun she had with them. I plan on letting her play with them when I am around to make it last a bit longer. To be fair, the only toy she hasn't managed to ruin is the king size Kong Ball so...5 stars on the fun factor but 2 on the lab factor so I gave it a 3. The other reviews were not labs and I expect that gives it a much longer life cycle."
1,"Careful, your dog might choke on the stuffing!","We have a 1.12 pound puppy (pomeranian puppy), and she recently started hacking, like she was trying to clear her throat. We couldn't figure out the source for this, until we found that the stitching on the INSIDE of this toy (the log, where the squirrels go) was not properly sewn, and there was exposed stuffing along the inside of this log/toy. She had been eating the stuffing! Lo and behold, when we took this toy away the hacking has almost completely gone away. She is ITTY BITTY and not an aggressive chewer, but with any puppy, if they can eat the stuffing and it's exposed they will do it. For the price, I am extremely disappointed! I thought this would be a high quality toy, and found out the hard way that it is not. BE CAREFUL PURCHASING THIS TOY."
1,dog loved it but destroyed it in 10 minutes,"my yorkipoo loved the toy, but it is not dog proof. he ripped the material very easily and started eating the inside. not sewn well. But, he does love it! Great idea just needs to be tweeked."
2,Great product for 1 month max!,"We have a Chihuahua and she loved playing with this toy. The only problem is that after about 3 weeks she already ripped off the ears on almost all of the squirrels and slightly ripped open the base (which has some hard cardboard).It's a cute and entertaining toy, but it's very important that you watch your pet while they play. That's supposed to be the rule with toys... but let's just say that you've been warned!"
2,Not good for large dogs,"The Hide-A-Squirrel is a cute item. The biggest problem with this product is the squirrels are too small for a large dog. They are about the size of my fist. My 65 pound 6 month old puppy is too large to play with the squirrels; which is too bad given he really loves squeaker toys. They fit entirely in his mouth and I fear he may choke on them. I expected them to be larger given I ordered the ginormous size, and I was highly disappointed."
3,Poor packaging and one of the squirrels didn't squeak,"I bought this as a toy for my puppy and when I received it, the packaging was already partially open, which I wasn't too happy about. Also, one of the squirrels had a squeaker that wouldn't squeak. I thought about returning it, but my puppy really loves the toy so we kept it."
4,"Loves the squirrels, he hates the ""house""","My dog doesnt get the concept of pulling them out of the house, but he loves the squirrels, but he did manage to chew an ear off in 5 minutes. He enjoys the different textures. Basically does what it says on the tin."
5,Ressu loves the squirrels,"Having been unable to get to the squirrels in the backyard, Ressu is taking full advantage of them in an easier to access site. She loves the toy."
5,Chico the huskie loves this toy.,My Huskie thinks this is the best thing he has seen and he is very choosy. In several years I have only known him to act this way twice...once with a red ball and this plush toy. He has shredded the holder but not the chipmunks. He has gotten a tremendous amount of enjoyment out of it and sill does in its shredded state. Highly recommend this.
4,"My dog loved it, but she also ate it.",Keep an eye on your dog with all plush toys so they don't eat them (if that happens to be an issue). My GSD loved the squeakers and only pulled the squirrels out a few times before she decided to just slice through the log material with her back teeth to get at the squirrels and prevent them from ever being hidden again. Good fun while it lasted.
3,"Dog loved it, but uh, not exactly in the way intended.","My dog loves, loves soft toys. I showed him how to use the toy, and would fill it for him (and he'd grab the squirrels out and rip at them) and then he figured out he could toss around and chew and tear the stump. Needless to say the stump is less capable of storing squirrels than it originally was.For what I paid for it, it's not a bad deal, but its also not as durable as I thought it would be. Perhaps the stump ought to be made of tougher material?"
5,The fun never ends.........,I have a 20 week female Malti-Poo... she just loves this toy... Put the Squirrels in and she takes them out... put the Squirrels in and she takes them out again! SHE ofter gets bored of the toys I've purchased - but this has truly captured her attention.
4,Supervision Required,"This is one of my 3.5 lb Pom-Chi puppy's favorite toys. When I go to work, I have been leaving this toy with my puppy, along with a treat in the bottom. She pulls the squirrels out every day. Tonight, however, when I got home, I found her with her head stuck in the trunk. It was even hard for me to get it off. A real Winnie-the-Pooh moment. This toy will be supervised from now on. Or maybe I just shouldn't put a treat in the bottom."
2,"Cute, exciting for 2 minutes...","Ok, cute toy, well made.And here's the but...I have a shih tzu, and I don't know if it's because of my dog's breed, but he sniffed the toy, bit the toy, played with it for literally 2 mintues and was no longer amused. So this toy is sitting in the corner. I think I will be donating someone, hopefully they'll get more use of it then we did."
5,Great toy for the price!,"My dog LOVES squeaky toys and this is all I hear:Squeak squeak squeak...squeak..squeakpretty much non-stop squeaking when he's playing.He loves it and this toy is a great value for it's price!So far, its holding up pretty well."
3,"Good toy, but the squirrels are not going to last long","We have one dog that never seemed to be interested in anything unless the other dog had it, except for this one, He likes the stump and sticking his head in the trunk. The stump seems to be somewhat durable, however, as soon as we opened it and the dogs got a hold of the little squirrels, cotton was all over the place. However, for the price it was okay and it does keep one of our dogs occupied pretty well, when nothing else (tennis balls, ropes) seem to keep his interest.UPDATE: Even though the squirrels are not the most durable stuffed toys out there, the stump for this thing took some pretty rough play from the dog and 2 kids (not quite tweener types). I actually though it might tear, but it did not. We rotate our dog toys out to keep them lasting longer and so our dogs think that they are getting new toys, so I think the stump might make it for the long haul."
1,Squirrels are not made to last,"The tree stump is the only thing that can withstand the chewing. The squirrels are already ripped up and my dog is still has her puppy teeth...if she had adult teeth, the squirrels would only last 5 seconds."
4,Really cute toy!,"The minute my little cairn terrier mix pupdog saw it, he started bouncing around - he wanted it. At first he tried to bite the log and make it squeak, but of course, that is not how it works. So I showed him that the 'squirrelies' can come out: he picked the log up, shook it severely, and all 3 'squirrelies' popped right out! So I replaced them, and added another small, stuffed toy. This time he had to work at getting the 'squirrelies' out of the log.The only drawback is that the 'squirrelies' are too small to allow him free play with them unless I'm watching him - he could easily swallow one. So I put the toy away. It will be a 'special occasion' toy that he will only get to play with periodically.But he loved it; and likes to make the 'squirrelies' squeak! The Junior size would likely be more appropriate for dogs under 10 pounds; but small dogs can play with supervision."
1,The chipmunks will fall apart if the dog looks at them too hard,"I had one of these before and it lasted a few months. My Scotty picked up one and it was in multiple partsin 30 seconds! We have beanie babies that they have tussled with for months that are still in tact. In lesshours 5 chipmunks were in the trash. No, they could not be repaired.Seriously, don't bother. I have two small non-destructive dogs."
5,"Hide A Squirrel Pet Toy, Large","My terriers love this toy. I can't keep the squirrels, or other toys, inside longer than an hour, when my dogs see that I have put toys in it, they go after it. Hilarious to watch."
4,cute toy,"It is the cutest dog toy I have ever seen. I got this and another toy for my cairn terrier this Christmas. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because he looses interest in it after he gets the 2nd squirrel out, doesn't bother looking for the 3rd. It is a fun toy to sit on the floor and play together with for about 15 min. You can stick your hand in and wiggle the squirrels. It drives my dog crazy, he will pull it out and squeak it then go after the other one. The little squirrels have held up well but I put it up after he starts loosing interest."
1,Hide-A Squirrel is a reject,"First, the squirrels were too easy to get out of the tree, and secondly my dog had all the squirrels torn apart by the second day. I would not recommend this toy to anyone!"
4,Great Toy,"The dogs love this toy and are always running around with both the 'squirrels' and the log. The puppy is a chewer and it took him a few months to put a hole in the log and rip a leaf off. The other dog had his for over a year and the only damage was that one of the three squirrels no longer squeaks, but they both love it and it keeps them busy, which I love."
5,Impatient Puppy,"I bought this toy for Panda's graduation class. He saw it, and I didn't have the heart to make him wait. He loves this toy. One look and it was an instant favorite. It is great quality and even though he is ALWAYS chewing on it, I have yet to find holes."
1,Very poorly constructed,We purchased the Ginormous Hide-A-Squirrel for our five dogs who love their stuffed toys. This toy literally lasted 10 minutes before the tree fabric had a hole in it and the stuffing was being pulled out. The chipmunks were also torn to shreds in no time. I have several cheapo stuffed dog toys from Walmart that have lasted for months. In the future we will stick with the VIP Products Mighty dog toys as they have typically survived more than a year. It gets one star because they enjoyed it for the 10 minutes it held up.
4,Junior size perfect for little dogs,"I bought the junior size and my little Cavalier absolutely loves it. It is smaller than I had anticipated but he loves to play with it. I think if you have a rough playing dog they might easily destroy it, but for those with average play dogs should be fine."
2,Poor Quality,"While the hide a squirrel is a great idea and my puppy enjoyed it, its very poor quality. 1 of the squirrels squeakers didnt work from the start, and after 20 minutes of play, 2 of the squirrels ears have come off as well as some hair. My puppy has numerous stuffed toys and has not destroyed any, so I was very surprised at how quickly these came apart. Its too bad b/c toy really is a lot of fun for her!"
2,Destroyed in seconds!,"5 mini-schnauzers + 1 Hide-A-Squirrel = shredded found squirrels and torn apart tree trunk in under 10 minutes.This toy is cute, but doesn't hold up unless the dog(s) have no teeth."
4,fun,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister's dog. The product arrived on time and in good condition and my sister's dog (and her cats) seems to enjoy it.
3,Too easy for my Chihuahua,It takes my Chihuahua less than a minute to get all the squirrels out of their home. I thought it would be stimulating and take up some of his time. But either my dog is a genius or this thing is too easy. I have a feeling it's the later.
5,Worth every penny!,Length:: 0:43 MinsYou can tell by the attached video how much Champ loves playing with this toy. It did not take him long at all to figure it out. Within 10 minutes he was bringing me the tree stump when it was empty because he wanted me to fill it with the squirrels again. I highly recommend this toy!
1,Less than 30 minutes,"I would not recommend this product for any dog/puppy that is an active chewer. Our 7-month little girl had chewed the legs off two of the squirrels, ripped the bottom seam, and removed/then shredded the cardboard liner in less than 30 minutes. Further item is manufactured in China, so I worried about the physical properties of the cardboard. Finally, was surprised how small the ""large"" was. I bought this item after reading the very positive reviews. I wish I could have left a positive review."
3,not hardy,The dogs LOVED this toy.One of them is a bit of a chewer (50 pound smooth collie).Ripped it apart pretty fast.But it was a total hit while it lasted!
5,"Took a while, but now he loves it!","I adopted a 1 year old dog. I bought this when I got him and he had zero interest in this and any toy for that matter. But 4 weeks later, he's finally interested in tennis balls, chew bones, and he loves the squirrels! I'm so happy because my sister's adopted dog from the pound immediately loved this toy which is why I bought it."
3,Hide a Squirrel Dog Toy,"This could be a fantastic toy but my dog got the squirrels out in 10 seconds and then he did not want to do it again - ""Been There- done that - more challenge please."" I like the toy myself - it is cute! Dudley brings us the little house to throw and he chases but once squeaker pops, the stuffing is doomed!"
3,Dog doesn't play with it.,"When I saw this I had to get it for my chihuahua. However, I think I like it more than him. He played with it for about a minute and now he doesn't care about it anymore. Every once in a while he will take one of the squirrels and chew the hair off its tail so I have to keep taking them away from him."
3,My dog is too smart for this.,"He figured out how to get the squirrels out in about 2 seconds...It's cute, and he carries the squirrels around, but not a challenging game."
5,Dog can't get enough of it!,We gave this to our pooch for Xmas and expected her to destroy it in a few minutes. But it's 10 days later and she still brings the trunk to us for tug and enjoys squeaking one squirrel after another. The trunk is a great combo of a tug and a plush toy.
5,My Pup loves it,cute- well made- exactly as described! I hide the squirrels inside and throw it for my dog. He goes and gets it and takes out all of the squrrels and brings them to me - one by one. Very cute!
3,He likes the squirrels,Our 9 month old lab loves the squirrels but doesn't understand how to play with them when they're inside the stump. He just likes gathering the squirrels and keeping them in one spot.
3,"Really cute, but always picking up the little squirrels","My dog was able to pull out the 3 squirrels in just a few minutes. I am always picking them up and putting them back in. Instantly back out. Maybe the holes could be a BIT snugger and make her work a little harder. She LOVES the little squirrels. If she does not come when I call her in the yard, all I have to do is squeak a little squirrel and she comes running. I bought one for my daughters dogs as well. Well made and worth the money."
4,Great Dive Watch...,"When I bought this I was looking for a Seiko watch that I could wear on weekends. Love this watch and am very pleased with the performance. Have always been a huge fan of Seiko watches and was not disappointed with this one. The self-winding feature was a definite plus for me. The only thing I don't care for is the weight. Takes a little getting used to, but I still believe it's worth it."
5,pleased with time piece,"this was the first time that i have ever ordered from amazon and was well pleased with service as well as the item that i ordered the seiko skxa35 watch the first time i ever saw a yellow faced seiko divers watch was in the grand caymans when i saw it on amazon i bought it right away i has worked well and i have recieved many compliments on it i would reccomend this watch and amazon to any one, thanks!"
3,"Nice, but broken","I loved this watch from when I got it about 7 months ago until a few days ago. It basically just stopped working. I had been wearing it all day, so I know it should have been working, but when I looked down, it had stopped about two hours earlier. It seems sturdy, the luminescent areas light up brightly, and I got a lot of compliments. Now I'll need to send it in for repair. I'm hoping for the best.Update on 3/8/05 : I sent it in for repair, and the turn-around time was about five weeks or so. During the repair process, I was unable to reach anyone by phone, so I just had to send the watch in with a note. This seems a little weird to me, but it worked out fine."
3,a bit of a waste,"don't get me wrong,i really like this movie,but,you have to wonder where eastwood was going with this. this is very watchable with the best performance from spacey,fleshing out his character admirably while maintaining mystique.unfortunately cusacks character just doesn't do him justice being somewhat undeveloped-he's a bit flat. the love interest is very flat. jude law is wasted in a bit part with not so good dialogue. the best done part was the comedy involving lady chablis,a wannabe transsexual,most amusing. it sounds like i don't have much to recommend this film,but it kept me glued to the screen well enough and has subsequently earned its place in my vid library,aired fairly often in times of need for light entertainment. a must for spacey fans."
3,"Decent, but expected more","There were high hopes for this film, but from what I remember this Eastwood project was considered a commercial and critical failure.Ouch...wait, it isn't THAT bad. The mood and setting is actually quite good---you really get the feel of the haunting atmosphere in Savannah. Also, Spacey (who plays Jim Williams) does an excellent job with the role.Certain problems, however, plague this movie. First of all, there is a lot of ""rambling"" as far as the plot is concerned...too much jumping around. Another issue I had with it is the length. Simply said, it is just too long, and I started playing gameboy advance in the dark in order to stay awake.As for the ""special edition"" dvd, I failed to see what was so freakin' special about it. The ""extra features"" on the menu are just text on the screen, nothing more. I think a documentary of the story would have worked nicely here instead of forcing the bored viewer to actually read something in funky print on the screen."
1,ALPAY SREK,"I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE A BORING FILM LIKE THIS. I SLEPT BY WATCING IT. I COULDN'T SEE THE END OF FILM AND IN FACT,I DON'T CARE.DON'T BUY IT CERTAINLY..."
1,can't review what i haven't received,I can't give you a review on this product because i haven't received said product yet.I've never had to wait so long for something that was supposed to be in stock
2,"Disappointed, very strong language","This had been recommended by a friend as a very good movie. The overall storyline was pretty good, but the language was awful. I'm beginning to think Webster's Dictionary should be required reading if the only words actors and actresses know are the few words used in movies today (and those words could be counted on one maybe both hands). I would not recommend this movie."
3,Too much plodding,"I was really surprised that Eastwood would allow this film to cruise along on such a low level of energy. Kevin Spacey is perfect in his role, Cusack so-so, and the Lady Chablis steals the scene. The quirky charm of the setting carries the movie along, but there is no tension or real anticipation to involve the viewer. The Cusack character evoked no empathy from me, he seemed a total mercenary, and that was crucial in dissapating whatever momentum the movie DID manage to develop. I was certainly hoping for better."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,This is one of my favorite movies of all times and Ipurchased as a gift for a friend who I also think willenjoy.
4,good movie,"I had just read the book and found out that there was a movie out on it, ordered it was not disappointed,it was an older movie, but pretty good. It is a true story."
2,OK but the book is 10x better,"I'd really say 2.5 stars if I could. I liked the film because I loved the book. And perhaps if I hadn't read that, I'd have liked the film more. However, having read the book well before film, I didn't like the things that were changed (especially the ending). Overall, if you haven't read the book, the film is very entertaining and totally amazing that it's based on a true story."
5,Great Viewing,The DVD was like new. I was able to view the movie and to see it clearly without any problems. The movie was suberb. It was a real surprise ending and I really enjoyed it from beginning to end.
5,One of the best books ever written,"The book is so well written I found it difficult to enjoy the film version. If you have not read the book your have missed THE BOOK, that litteraly made Savannah a tourist attraction. Brendt has done what Margaret Mitchell with GWTW, it simply can't be topped. It is a classic for the ages."
3,Clint Could have done better,"The book was amazing in its grasp onto the culture, the way the charactors play out so on and so fourth. The movie though seemed to race through the book...take the time to make the movie as good as the book if it takes an extra hour or two of movie then do it...don't make a rushed adaptation doesn't fly...now mind you the movie is something to watch and no wheres near as bad as Stephen King's movie adaptation of Tommyknockers...but it could have been much better"
1,Bad DVD,"I was so disappointed when I watched this DVD - Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is one of my favorite movies and I was so excited to watch it. Imagine my disbelief when it started ""pixilating"", skipping over scenes and losing dialogue. Then, the entire ending of the movie was missing. What was supposed to be a 155 minute movie ended up being 120 minutes. I will return this DVD to Amazon.com and will now be skittish about ordering from them again, especially DVD's."
5,Super cute,There is only one postcard that has actually writimg and that is the cover title ....the other one displays the f word ...but the pcs are xute displaying sometimes awkward imagery such as cutting and smoking
5,Seiko Men's Strap Watch #SXB850,Returned because of size however I did order the women watch and I love it.
1,Geforce is the WORST graphics card out there,"Geforce 4 mx's our horrible, Nvidia using unversial drivers which leads to many complications and ATI is driver specific I recently just bought a ATI 9700 pro card and I have no problems with ""choppyness"" and just to add to the first review you have no clue what ur talking about being that the 9700 series is vastly superior to geforce mx series I just have to say that this card dominates any Geforce card out there no competition whatsoever I will never buy Geforce and I suggest everyone else should take my advice"
4,Good intro tool for recording oneself,"The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate. Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it. The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for. That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs I've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist. This should come with a good ""how-to-use"" course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications."
5,Works Great! Great Price!,I bought this for use with the DAW Ableton live. I compared many similar cards in the price range and none of them seemed to bring thesort of value that this one dose. The card worked great when hooked up to my monitors. Everything sounded great and when configuredthere was little to know latency. If you want to get into recording this is a cheap and simple solution that offers great quality/ease of use.
1,"Always read the 1 star ratings , the said ... and I didn't listen","HelloI was so excited about this thing when I first saw it , hey look and audio interface with XLR and other stuff for only $60 !I bought this and got it shipped to Kuwait by Aramex , unpacked it , connected it and the world started crashing around me.There was this louuuuud so very loud hiss coming out of the XLR input , I checked everything on my laptop with no solution.Hiss and hiss and very loud hisses and whistles.I couldn't record anything , I use a dynamic K&K; Mic , the hiss only goes away when I connect it to the line 2 input in the back , which disconnects the XLR input , but the volume was very low , and when I amplify it by audio software I get loud noise as usual.I ended up throwing this away , and I intend to buy a USB Microphone.So, whatever you are thinking of while looking to this disgusting thing , put it away."
2,Poor mic compatability,"I bought this to replace an m audio fast track that had developed an annoying intermittent shriek through headphones. On installation I found that this unit didn't offer compatibility with Skype and had poor preamplification of my Shure SM 48 via the XLR input. My onboard sound software Adobe Audition did not register the mic output at all, even though the driver options were set correctly, and the supplied Cubase registered very low mic volume, even though the mic input was turned to maximum. My choice was to return the unit or purchase a mic preamp, which I was loathe to do.....Seeing the m audio had good enough recording volume and was compatible with Skype I have decided to by another unit from from m audio and return this unit to Amazon."
1,NOOOOOO,"Please purchase a focusrite product, please. Even a Focusrite Saffire 6 USB interface will blow this puppy out of the water. Focusrite sounds a trillion times better in the low end and super high end frequencies. I can't believe I even wasted my time with this product. You pay for what you get for..."
3,Not too bad,"Works relatively well, just not really how I like eggs. Is definitely quick and easy. Great for making scambeled eggs for the kids without the mess."
4,Oh My Omelet,"My sis gave this to me. I can count the number of times I've made Omelets on the hand of a clumsy shop teacher. This product is an excellent omelet maker. I put some turkey bacon in it, some onion and seasoning. I melted some cheese on top (forgot to put it inside). It took about 6 minutes. I will say that the hinges aren't very good. You don't close it until it's done anyway so hinges be not an issue. Enjoy your breakfast!"
2,Works OK - Got to be something better,"The complaints you read about the door opening mechanism are true. It's terrible. I will be surprised if this thing lasts a year.Worse however is the radio interference. Start the microwave, and the cordless phone and wireless router stop working until it's done cooking.Good thing I don't want children - with the bleed over this thing has I'm afraid to stand near it while it's running."
5,I love it.,"I really love this microwave.I was concerned that it would not be tall enough for some of my tupperware tumbler type cups but they fit inside just fine.It cooks the food rapidly,accurately and and it looks great in my kitchen.I love the digital read out also.I will recommend this microwave to others...My sister has the Black one and she loves her too."
4,Just right for me...,"The Panasonic NN-H765WF was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a microwave in white to match my other appliances that was powerful enough for my needs. It works very well for heating and defrosting and is very efficient. This microwave is more powerful than older ones, you do have to reduce the cooking time for many foods. So far I am very pleased with this microwave oven and it was reasonably priced."
1,Door malfunctioned shortly after purchase,"The unit worked well for about a month. Then the unit ceased to recognize that the door was closed. Since a microwave will not operate with an ""open door,"" it is now a practically brand new nonfunctional unit. Panasonic gave me a choice of 3 authorized service centers, none of which are in convenient locations for me. There are no mail-in repair options. I am very disappointed and it is unlikely that I will ever purchase a Panasonic microwave again."
4,Good buy for the wattage,"We bought this microwave for a built-in shelf, wanting a lot of power for a medium-sized space. Does a great job, especially since we're still moving in and I'm using it everyday. Yes, it would be nice if the Quick Minute button did not require you to press Start, but other than that, I have no complaints."
3,Pleased with price.,"It does not seem to cook as fast as previous Panasonic I owned and it makes louder noise when cooking than previous one. It seems to be longer and not as tall as previous one. With width and length, it just did fit on my counter. I wish it had a handle to open it with rather than push button style. After searching and looking at different microwaves, I was pleased with price of this one. I have always been pleased with Panasonic products."
3,More Like a Commercial Machine,"I gave this mixed reviews because there's a big difference in generation at 1250 watts and our old microwave which runs at 1000 watts. It takes about half the time to heat/cook but it will also cook your paper plates, and it burned the popcorn bag, using the built in button. It's just too much machine for two old folks. This is going to a local charity advising them to review the information booklet before using."
5,panasonic is always good to me,we bought this new microwave because the old sharp 1.8 cuft microwave died after 13 years. hope this one lasts
4,We really like our new microwave!,"We love most everything about this microwave... Size, power, color and usefulness. The only thing I would change is the button that opens the door on the microwave. The shape of it sometimes allows our fingers to slip off therefore having to hit the botton twice to get the door open. It seems like this piece of the micro may not hold up to the test of time."
4,good stuff,"A decent piece of work that really defies current genre classification. It's not punk, but it's not metal either."
5,For the serious collector,"This is a well-organized reference to McCoy. It contains a history of McCoy; this added knowledge adds to the fun of collecting and allow you to sound more as if you know what you are doing. Then there are pages on the different ""marks"" of the pottery. There is a dated value guide. Nevertheless, I find it easer to do my own comparing. The big plus is the color pictures that show what is available. For those discriminate people that do not just buy anything that says McCoy there is an index. It is also fun to see you McCoy pieces in the book.McCoy Pottery Ultimate Reference"
5,Ravel's Bolero,"I did not believe that, given the countless interpretations of Bolero, anyone could dream up of a way to make it fresh, listenable and, most importantly, exciting. Well, Jacques Loussier did it! The trio used its unique interpretative style to give the work new life and reason to listen to it again and again.Rolando Arango"
2,BORING,Music lacks direction and a sense of feeling.... Kims vocals are terrable... she sings but it isnt very forceful... Its like she is singing but not really putting all of her feeling into it... good guitar work but that isnt enough to save this cd. Sorry guys mabye next time you will do better.
3,The standard,"This one is a little out of whack. This album contains guitars so detuned that some of the riffs could induce a bowel movement. Yet, the overall impression is that this could have been so much more inventive and unique than it is. There are moments that are unique (see the cover of the S&G song -- killer!), but more often than not there is the Pantera-like chugging and the Slayer-like riffing. Warrel Dane is, as always, a god, which still makes me want to recommend this album, but don't buy this one if it is your first listen to Nevermore: go back at least to Dreaming Neon Black or better yet start at the beginning."
1,Zero stars,"Play Greg Hastings instead, it gives you what this game is lacking. Worst game I've ever played."
5,this cd is really great!!,this cd was so good...i hadnt ever heard them before and after buying it i got hooked..squirrel nut zippers have a sound thats unique while still staying hip..the music has a beat that makes you want to dance which sometimes reminds me of cherry poppin daddies or manhattan transfer.squirrel nut zippers are just a really great band i think this cd is the best and not only the hit song Hell but the rest of them too...this isnt one of those cds that you only like a few songs on..you can actually listen to the whole thing and be happy..id really recommend it
5,An contemporary esoteric stroke of genius!,"Why is this a stroke of genius. I'll tell you why. The reason is because nobody in even the remotest public eye is doing anything like this or anything half as original. As many people who have heard this, I would quote their influences being Duke Ellington, Billie holiday and the old Jazz greats, with a touch of spice and swing thrown in for good measure. The results being the smash hit ""hell"" which was more or less revamped for their new album. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable listen and a CD of originality for your collection. Highly recomended!"
5,If it's good enough for Grandad its good enough for me,"Totally kickin My first swing album, my friends and i will play it at school and dance in the halls, once you turn it on you cant turn it off ! dont know how many times i was late for class just because of it, And it is a great album to during those times when your folks wanna see your beddroom floor for once!"
1,Signifying Nothing,Why did the New Yorker and Knopf publish such a lightweight? And would they publish her again? Rose seems to think that the sun rises and sets on her feelings. The book is mercifully short
2,"Supposed to play jpeg files, but . . .","I purchased this DVD player specifically because they claimed that you could copy jpg files to a CD-R and play them on your TV set through the DVD player. So far I haven't had much luck at doing this. It seems to be very finicky about what CDs it will accept or the format of the jpg image. They list only four CDs in the instruction manual that they say will work - the Kodak Picture CD, Canon QuickCD, Fujicolor CD and the Noritsu QSS CD. As a DVD player, it is mediocre, no better or worse than other DVDs in its price range - I have a another brand DVD that cost about the same but is a lot easier to use."
5,amish books,books perfect. just a thin black magic marker line across bottom pages close to book spine
2,Hums like old fluorescents,"We were hoping to replace a standard incandescent bulb with this, but this bulbs hums really loudly like an older fluorescent tube. All my other CFLs are hum-free."
4,Loved it!,I love Mithgar. The book is a wonderful collection of stories .I am definitely happy with this purchase and plan to make more purchases.
2,Poor sonics,"The sound is very poor. Plain and simple. Look for Walter somewhere else (like his CBS recording of Dvorak's 9th Symphony, with a surprisingly clear sound)."
4,Last performance before he died.,"The tape was recorded by the Japanese TV. Quality is not very good, but for lovers of Chet Baker this concert is very good and special because it was his last concert before he died in Amsterdam, with very good Dutch bas and drums players."
1,Chet Baker Live in Tokyo,The CD was absoluteky worthless since I could not get it to play. I feel I was ripped off big time. I will think twice before ordering from you again.Judith Gordon
4,Good Gift - just need to know a few things before you use it,"I love being able to make footprint of my son's feet each month! With that said, here is what you need to know about this product - the ink pad will dry out after the first use unless you put in a ziplock bag. Also - the ink don't wipe off easily from the baby's feet with a wet towel - I was shocked the first time I used it - but I did the print right before a bath and when he came out of the tub his feet were perfectly clean. Honestly I never used the calendar - just the ink pad - I used plain index cards and dated them for his baby book.Good luck!"
2,An ok player with some usability problems,"This unit has a very good picture, and generally good sound, except I found the sound will occasionally skip for a moment, even on brand new discs. The remote is comfortable to hold and has faintly backlit buttons in the middle, which makes it easy to find in the dark. The ""menu"" button, unfortunately, is in the middle of a bunch of buttons on the top half of the remote, so it's difficult to find. Also the up/down/left/right buttons are on the bottom of the remote but are rather small.Quirks: pressing fast-forward on the remote will only ffwd for about 10-15 seconds before freezing. You have to press ""play"" and then ""ffwd"" again to make it continue.Also, it doesn't remember where you were on the disc when you power down the player. And it has an auto-off power saving function, so if you pause the movie and leave the room for 20 minutes and then return, it's turned itself off and you've lost your place."
2,Disappointed with characters,"After reading a review from The Romance Reader site and seeing all the 5 star reviews here, I thought it would be an enjoyable read. The first part of the book is plausible, but the conflict was a big letdown. I hate it when writers create women characters who are unreasonable and unwilling to listen to any explanation. The ""Heroine""'s reaction was completely overblown in my opinion because her background didn't support it! It really got tiring and I had to struggle through a large portion of this book and an irrational female. I can't recommend it."
3,Misleading Title,"I just wanted it stated that the word ""complete"" is misleading. I enjoyed the MASK cartoons growing up, and remember the second season...or ""racing series"" as it is called.....and thought since this was advertised as the complete series it included that second season. I wish the manufactures had stated it as the first season only. The quality is good for having been transferred all these years later. I do like the fact that they kept the commercial break intros and bring backs in the shows and also still have the PSA at the end."
3,"Great, while it lasts.","Nice features, lightweight, and easy to use. Unfortunately, it lasted just beyond the warranty period before failing. Cost to repair was about the same as a new microwave. It rated five stars while it worked, but only 1 star after it failed, averaging out to 3 stars.I'm afraid after this happened to two Panasonic models within 4 years, I just can't justify buying this brand again. And I really like Panasonic for other products. Sigh."
1,Did Not Function,"This unit would run for about 20 seconds and then turn off. No matter what function (heat beverage, dinner plate) or just using timed heating. I called Panasonic customer service. They told me to unplug the unit and plug it back in after a minute. Did that with no better results. Then they gave me the address for a repair center that is at least 25 miles away. Needless to say I'm returning it. Excuse me, gotta run to Sears to get a microwave."
1,Not So Good,"I got it for $7. Not happy, but will keep it just because it was so inexpensive.Very light weight and flimsy feeling. No 'lid' as the description alluded to and I thought was included ... but it's not"
1,Disapointed,"I first bought my T3 in October 2004, it was the best thing ever, sleek, shiny smooth hair, effortless, no damage whatsoever to my hair. After 6 months,it wasn't heating up as well, so I sent it back and got a new one. The new one is horrible,exact same model, but I don't know what happened. Dry frizzy hair, I have to spend an extra hour straightening than I did before. I can't even contact the distributors because there is no contact info on the product. Very disapointed in my replacement. If you can keep your original working, then it's great, but don't count on that 48month warranty replacement."
4,"Excellent textbook, but riddled with typos","This book is a great way to learn VB! The tutorial structure makes learning easy and logical. But beware -- the ""one hour"" chapters rarely only take one hour, and the follow-along exercises have a frustrating number of typos."
1,Don't even waste your money,"This product, purchased BRAND NEW from Amazon.com, didn't work. Even when using new batteries, instead of the ones sent with the product, it still didn't work. What a waste!"
2,Terrible performance,"NYKO 83040 PLAYSTATION 3 Blu Wave Remote I didn't have high expectations, so I figured I wouldn't be disappointed. I was wrong. Button presses often aren't recognized or they are recognized too many times. Overall, it's just easier to use the Sixaxis gaming remote that comes with the ps3. I returned it to Amazon, the process couldn't have been better. I will definitely continue to shop at Amazon."
3,It's OK,I got this infrared remote so that I could control the PS3 with my harmony universal remote. Everything worked OK however one of the nice things about the harmony is it powers on (or off) all your devices however because it's not Bluetooth it can't turn the PS3 on or off. This was quite a pain and after a few times use I actually quit using the infrared remote all together and when back to the PS3 remote.
2,Pretty but lacking PS button,"It all comes down to the fact that there's no PS button on the remote. So there's quite a bit of missing basic functionality. The remote itself looks beautiful and if it had a PS button it would absolutely supplant my other remote. As it is, it really doesn't end up making things any easier."
4,Infra red remote for PS3,"This infra red remote (transmitter/receiver) was exactly what I was looking for. Since the PS3 doesn't have an infrared receiver, only the Sony bluetooth remote or game controller will work with it. This device plugs into the USB port and gives the PS3 an infra red receiver.Why? I have an older Marantz remote control that works great, but won't do any kind of RF transmitting. I wanted to keep just one remote, but the PS3 was forcing me to leave either the game controller or the PS3 dedicated remote (have to buy) out. I programmed my Marantz remote using the ""3 Blu Wave Remote"" and tossed the Blue Wave remote in the drawer with the rest of the remotes. Now I just have one remote for everything.As other reviewers noted, you can't turn the power off with the remote, but I don't have a problem with that as I have to go to the equipment rack to turn off power amplifiers anyway."
4,Cheapest way to get your Harmony to work with PS3,"Can't complain about this product. Even though the remote is basically a throw away component because all I really needed was the USB IR dongle. Anyone who needs a solution to make their PS3 work with their Harmony remote, this is it. It's especially nice because having the Blu Wave remote allows for an easy way to program your Harmony by using all the features of the Blu Wave remote."
4,Does the job,I purchased this years ago and it is still ticking. We do not use it too often since hubby uses the controller alot and now has universal remotes that do everything but in the event we cannot find it he grabs this one and it still does the job.
4,Functional not formal; good value,"I've switched from using pounds of facial tissue to using washable handkerchiefs. I was particularily looking for informal, soft, cheap white 'kerchiefs. These fit the bill. A little stiff coming out of the package, but after washing, became soft and gentle on my delicate nose. I like that they are quite thin, light and small - I tuck them into my pocket for hiking, keep some in my purse and my car. Apparently, I blow my nose a lot! I've washed mine several times and the hems have not unraveled - not a single one. Handkerchiefs are hard to find and these worked out well for me; in fact, I'm purchasing another packet."
1,Missing music warning ... don't buy this !,"Don't buy this CD, it's a rip off, on the box it says 72 minute mix made up of 12 tracks. Stick the CD in, and you only get 11 tracks in 45 minutes. Pity because the content on the whole is pretty good."
4,micranots- good underground hiphop,"hey, I want everyone to get it straight. MC I Self Divine is from MINNESOTA! He went to south high school. Yep. Anyways, he was born in Cali, lived most of his life in MINNESOTA, but does his music out of Atlanta. Yeah, this cd is fresh too, the beats are complex and the rhymes come heavy with content. I like it alot and you should buy it. I did."
4,helpful,I purchased this for a home which house individuals who are deaf and receive 24/7 supports. The books been helpful.
4,Turn of the Century Heresy,"For those who know anything about Mark Twain, this writing will not surprise you. His sardonic sense of humor is prevalent through the entire collection. It does not surprise me that this writing was not published until well after his death. This book shows a most certain disdain for the human race and is quite enjoyable if you are not a starch creationist."
4,Different and Diverse,"This CD seems to be a good cross-cut of what Dead Can Dance was capable of doing. It seems to be a bit inconsistent although very nicely done. The group might have focused more on a particular style or theme of their other efforts. I realize this is a ""best of"" album, and so a few different genres were represented. I discovered the group accidentally just week ago while perusing Celtic CDs, including Patrick Cassidy. I took a step of faith and ordered this CD. I'm not disappointed one bit. I'll enjoy it for a long time to come. Oh, yeah, one thing, when the first track starts off, don't think your CD player is having a problem. The synthesized opening strains are for real. It kinda threw me off at first, but it culminates into a great piece. Sit back, relax, and enjoy it."
1,The best?,"I would have to say that it is somewhat impossible to impose this is the very best of dead can dance on us. With so many albums and solo projects between them and previous compilation releases how can you finger just these 12 or 14 songs as ""the very best"". Comming from a true fan this is rediculous at best.As far as endorsing a compliation, I cant and I wont. I see it as a ploy by the industry to squeeze out a few more dollars. Your better off making your own complilation on mp3 at least you can fit more songs."
1,ODDLY DISAPPOINTED,"I am a HUGE Dean Koontz fan. I LOVED Odd Thomas - the first book. What an amazing story, character and ending. Then the Second one was slow but okay and now this - brother odd? WHAT was DK thinking? I was bored to tears over the monestary and the boring characters I just couldnt waste my time finishing it. How many times must DK make Odd tell everyone about his pancakes or have the characters talk about them??? BORING> If this is your First book of DK - skip it and grab another, Odd Thomas, By the Light of the Moon - dont waste your time with this one."
2,Hard to read,"I bought these for my brother. I got the first 2 of the Odd Thomas series. He asked me not to send him anymore of these, said they were really hard to read.When I mentioned that to another friend of mine she said the same thing, she said the concept was great but it was so hard to read it wasn't enjoyable. Oh well...most Dean Koont are sooooo good!"
5,Brother Odd,"Koontz' Odd Thomas stories are among my favorite and Brother Odd is no exception. the story has you from the first page and as usual Koontz doesn't waste any time getting to the action. this is the 3rd Thomas book and the timing on release so far has been great. since he doesn't do ""series"" i was surprised to see him release this 3rd book. but if you like Koontz you will love this book."
3,Quck Review,"The third story featuring the character Odd Thomas, the ghost-seeing ex-fry cook introduced in ""Odd Thomas"" and continued in ""Forever Odd"". This one finds Odd retreating to a monastery/orphanage in response to events in the previous books. His solitude is interrupted when one of the monks goes missing and Odd observes dark entities stalking the children. The book contains Dean Koontz's usual blend of humor, suspense and snappy dialogue. While the first book is still the best. this was an enjoyably quick and breezy read."
4,Odd at with the Habit,"Maui H.S.This was the most interesting story to me of all the Odd Thomas books I've read to date. I liked the monasterial setting. I loved the challenged kids. The mother superior and sisters were fantastic characters. The mad Russian at the end was the epitome of characters. The interaction and humor of Odd Thomas with these characters was well done. Best of all, Odd Thomas didn't have to kill anyone. The character meant to kill did. I also liked the introduction of Boo and Frank Sinatra. ..."""
3,Better than Forever Odd but not as good as Odd Thomas,"You can read a synopsis of this book anywhere on the web.The pacing of this book seemed a little, pardon the pun, odd to me. Dean does a great job building up to the climax... but with an extremely quick climax and an even quicker resolution I cant help but feel a little let down by Brother Odd. The ending of the book wasn't a really ending as it was more of a setup for the next book. Also, much as I enjoyed the playful banter between Odd and the Russian, I couldn't help but feel that it was just to over done in the novel.This book is by far WAY better than Forever Odd but it is not as good as the original. Bottom line is that if you are a fan of the Odd Thomas series than this book will scratch your Odd Thomas itch. A must read for true fans. I just got my copy of Odd Hours and I cant wait to crack it open."
4,Another Great,"I finished this book in one reading. All of the Odd Thomas books were wonderful, but Forever Odd was the best of the series. This one went off on an even wilder tangent, and was just a little too surreal. It was filled with Koontz's signature dry wit and was very entertaining. The characters brought out much heartfelt emotion for me. You found yourself pulling for them all, even the bad guy. And the Elvis sideline added a touch of whimsy. I especially liked Brother Knuckles and the Mother Superior. All in all, another great read."
3,"Solid sequel, but not the original","I just love Dean Koontz and have read most of his books. The first Odd Thomas had excellent characterizations, intriguing storyline, and suspense. This sequel is good, but not equal to the original. In fact, I would recommend reading the first in the series, if you have not done so, to really appreciate this sequel. This story starts off with an interesting mix of elements: the lovable Odd Thomas ( the ghost-seer), in a monastic community, with a physicist, a Russian stranger, and severely handicapped children with special gifts. A monk goes missing...murder? Odd, of course, is swept into the mystery. The story turns into supernatural science...stretching the imagination and maybe a bit far from the average readers' science background. A good read with a few unexpected plot twists, some predictable, some not. The characters are not as well-developed as the original, though. I would recommend it to all who love Odd Thomas and want to find out where he is now."
2,Spooky,"A tightly woven plot filled with science fiction, mystery, hooligans and hobgoblins. There is not much more to be said. A good Halloween read."
1,Why all the love for this thing?,"Fanboy Syndrome?This has got to be one of the worst books I've read in 40 years. Not even the ghostof the King himself could keep me awake through this muddled mess.Boring, tedious, stupid, and uh REAL STUPID! Its not even worth the words. Why peoplerave about Dean Koontz I will never know."
2,Hard to finish,"I'm a big fan of Dean Koontz books, and was looking forward to another in the Odd Thomas series. However, I found myself getting bored, and had it not been for it being a Dean Koontz book about one of my favorite characters, I would have quit halfway through.I loved Boo the dog, but Elvis got old really fast. And the bone things just didn't seem realistic or even scary for that matter, just pedantic at best.I wish we could have Stormy back--at least that made Oddie more interesting...Here's hoping the next installment is better."
3,Felt it was not exciting enough!,"This is Dean Koontz's third Odd Thomas novel. The first was Odd Thomas, and its sequel Forever Odd.A monk of St. Bartholomew's Abbey, Thomas has the ability to see the spirits of the dead, a gift he has used to prevent future tragedies. The story opens with Thomas seeing bodachs, sinister entities whose appearance precedes dire tragedies. Now Thomas has to stop the tragedy that is about to happen.This is a fun book to read. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat, and at times in uncontrollable laughter. Thomas can see the spirit of Elvis Prestley, who keeps him company, and those scenes are pretty hilarious.The only weakness I found was the ending. I was hoping for a much better ending."
3,"Good, but not his best...","I really like the idea of this series, especially the ""searching soul"" aspects of young Odd, particularly in this edition's monastic setting. However, Koontz's characterization of him as a cherubic smart-alec does wear on one a bit. What really doesn't fit is Koontz's political kvetching spoken through Odd. The kid is far too young to have such a monstrous right-leaning cultural belly ache. Clearly, these ramblings are the author's thinly-veiled soap box issues which grow more strident with each Odd installment. I can only hope that Koontz's editors will tell him to shut up already and do what he does best. It's a shame to waste simplistic grandstanding on such an amazing and unusual young man. Plus, there's always room in the non-fiction section where he can vent his frustrations."
4,Prices too high,I love these bags - have used them for several years. I enjoy the scent as well as the size and thickness. Just want everyone to know that you can buy them from the manufacturer for MUCH cheaper. The 35 folded bags are only 3.99 on their website (compared to 19 dollars here ?!)Still giving 4 stars because I like the product- but amazon has the pricing VERY wrong !
4,Very good watch!,I am very satisfied with the watch. It looks great and feels just right- not too heavy and not too light. The dial is dark but still you can see the hands quite well even when it is not so light. The only thing I have to warn you against is that the links of the wrist band are quite big and I couldn't manage a very comfortable size.I have managed to keep it without scratches so far without much ado. Most of the casing is brushed steel and that makes it easier not to scratch. I can't comment on the battery life which is something that I am a little worried about since this is a model from 2005. Mine was made somewhere in the beginning of 2005. I deem this purchase worth the money .
4,so far so good,I don't believe these are 1=micron sediment filters but they are as good or better than the 5-micron ones I was using. We will see how long they last between changes.
5,Have not used yet,"Great price and rated highly by others. I hope these 1 micron filters will work with my new Watts whole house water filter. Watts calls for 50 micron filters. Does anyone know if this would cause a problem?I'm on city water, but it's a small town and the water comes out of a lake/water reservoir and have noticed silt in the water. Our fridge has a filter for drinking water. Maybe these will prolong the life of the fridge filter?"
3,water filters,"They will work out, but didn't get enough of a close up to see the quality of the product, not exactly what we thought we were getting, need to be able to zoom in to get a better picture of the cartridge fabric"
4,Serengeti Lamone Drivers Polarized Sunglasses,"As they are known to be one of the best drivers sunglasses I ordered via Amazon.com without checking prices elsewhere, since Amazon is known to have very competitive prices. Only to find out after ordering that the same available at ""Optic World"" for almost half the price. (Actual saving if ordered via Optic World would have been about $70)Sent a e mail regarding this to Amazon.com with Optic world price list website and no reply to this after nearly 6 weeks.The Sunglasses quality is very good and recommend this brand to any one who wants a quality drivers sunglasses.The Glasses came in original packaging without any damages."
2,too small,"Although the price was reasonable, upon receiving it the size of the lettering was too small and would require a magnifying glass to read"
2,Not good enough on its own,"I needed a map to get around all of Charleston, SC. It was nice that this was laminated, but it does not cover very much of the city, and not in enough detail to be useful. I ended up using google and my phone gps to get around."
4,Wow!,I bought these legos for a 7 year old friend. He really like Star Wars & Legos so it was a great gift for him. I think he enjoys playing with them just as much as his parents do!
4,star wars imperial landing craft,"This is a very good quality product, but a little too difficult for my 9 year old to put together on his own."
2,Augustus Review,"Not a particularly good production. It does not have the fine qualities of ""I, Claudius"" or the recent HBO ""Rome"" series. More like a spaghetti western."
5,The Most Underrated Band Ever,"This CD is awesome. I can't understand why this band flies so far under the radar. They write compelling, gorgeous music that should be able to be appreciated by anyone with an ear for experimental music combined with the most haunting hooks I have ever heard. Do yourself a favor and buy everything you can by this group."
3,"It's O.K., but plant selections is terrible","I have tried several consumer landscape design programs and this one is better than most in some areas, notably ease of building houses and decks. But if you are looking for something for designing plantings, this is not it. Its plant selections was woefully inadequate. Most of the plants I needed (which are very common in the Southern California area) were not available, or in very limited varieties. I ended up having to import most of my plants from pictures and that works O.K., but it's a lot of work and a pain to find a good picture of the plant I need. I imagine the plant selection would be just as dire in other parts of the country, because this program has by far the fewest number of plants available."
3,Works but Poor Quality Manufacturing,I purchased to remove an AC clutch on a 95 Buick which it got the job done. I did have to clean the threads to get all the parts together properly. The machining was not very precision for such an expensive tool.
4,A Digital Porn Scheme,"This is another good mystery and page-turner in the Marshall Tanner series. Like all the other books in the Tanner series it is a fun and literate read. Tanner is a tough, literate, liberal and tongue-in-cheek guy.The story line deals with a digital porn scheme and a young woman who gets sucked into its depths. Peggy Nettleton, Tanner's old flame, hires him to find her prospective step-daughter who is the victim that is caught up in this mess.This is a fun read, several steps above the usual page-turners in this genre."
1,No English subtitles,"I want to love this film, but I don't speak fluent French, and there is no option for English subtitles on this DVD. It's misleading as the Amazon editorial review is in English and the synopsis and review quotes on the DVD box are in English, too.REALLY WISH I could view this film with subtitles. As it is, it is mostly lost on the non-French speaker."
3,program around the fred songs for maximum enjoyment,"dash rip rock's second record is a better sounding improvement on their debut, with many songs remaining in their set today. mud island is a historical civil war song, all hung up is great pop, leave me alone to my bottle is one of rock's great odes to alcohol & misery & johnny ace is a punk ode to the legendary singer, ""a rock and roll jesus with a cowboy mouth"". the downside of this record is the presence of FOUR (4) songs by future cowboy mouth leader/buffoon fred leblanc. the only one worth anything is jenny says, which fred, knowing it was the only decent song he'd ever written, rerecorded THREE more times until it became an ""alternative radio"" pseudo-hit. for fred in all his garbage glory, listen to love money time, but just once as the stink wont leave your room for days. as long as you have a programmable cd player, this is a great purchase.."
2,Disappointed; doesn't hold charge,"I should have returned these. Figured return cost wasn't worth effort. Great price, but the two I bought do not hold a charge. Stick with the Olympus batteries. I do not recommend these."
5,I would buy another,"This battery replaced the one I had in my Olympus camera. As you can see, it sells for far less money. However, it works at least as well as the original. I'd buy it again."
3,not as good as armageddon,"I got the CD of Deep Blue Sea and was shocked when the CD finished within 30 minutes. The Trevor Rabin were very rythmic that's nice about it. The problem was nice cues were removed from the soundtrack such as the scene in the film where the red clipper plane lands at the habitat, and the best cue in the film the ending, where that shark wrangler was riding the shark it wasn't in the CD as well. I felt something was missing after listening to this, it wasn't as good as Armageddon, though some cues were removed from that the whole album didn't feel like it was too short. I just hope in the future work of rabin he won't disappoint me again by leaving out 30 second cues that could have made the difference."
5,"NOTHING LIKE ""JAWS"" BUT JUST AS GOOD!","The score to Jaws is still one of the best in the world of movie music as far as action and horror, but it has a new rival. The music of Deep Blue Sea by Trevor Rabin is a majical and suspensful score that everyone can enjoy. I can't speak highly enough of it. 5 STARS! Good Work Trevor!"
1,unhip-pos,"I can't believe that this CD is still being sold? I remember when I saw them at The Hammerstien Ballroom in New York. During the big internet buisness boom of 1999, Yahoo had done some big promotion with Smash Mouth and Lucious Jackson. Interns from Tweck.com (which is probably out of buisness by now)were handing out free cup warmers. The Hippos were so awful that the whole audience began to throw them at the band. The drummer was pelted and one of the warmers hit his snare drum. Seriously, if you like Ska music then please stick with the classics like the father of Ska, Prince Buster or Madness. If you want modern ska then check out Less than Jake, and Aquabats. Don't waste your time with this."
2,Buy FORGET THE WORLD!,"I first heard the Hippos on their debut album ""Forget the World"" and I loved it. When I ran across this CD I expected the same great ska sound from the other but I was wrong. My favorite song by them Far Behind sounds like some little hip hop 80's remix with the synthesizer. I thought remakes were supposed to be better than the original. Though these guys are a great band and have great potential I would not recommend this CD it is not their best work."
4,All Hands Hoay!,"Arrrrrr! Listen up ya scurvy landlubbers! If ya likes tales of life on the high seas, then set sail for your nearest record store, and don't forget to bring your booty. Tell the swab behind the counter that he'd better give ya Running Wild's Pile Of Skulls if he don't wanna end up doing the Hempen Jig. Pile Of Skulls is a mighty fine cd of pirate metal to enjoy over a blackjack of bumboo after a long day on the dogwatch. Buy it today, ya miserable dogs, or I'll see to it you gets a good keelhauling."
5,An All Time Classic,An all time classic from the masters of Pirate Metal. No heavy metal collection is complete without this treasure.
2,Great picture book that loses its charm in Kindle Fire format,"As any fan of the original Eloise books knows, the detailed drawings by Hilary Knight are key to their appeal to both children and adults. Unfortunately this book does not lend itself to the Kindle Fire format -- the drawings are rendered as two-page spreads, making much of the amusing detail too small to appreciate. The original text is also almost impossible to read, and although the text pop-up feature is enabled, using it obscures the drawings, which is sure to cause frustration if you are reading the story to your child.I'm a big fan of the Kindle, but this picture book definitely does not suit the Kindle Fire format."
4,Packing of Pumpkin Puree,"AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASEThe cans of pumpkin puree were so poorly packed that the box was nearly open and all the cans were badly dented--so dented that it was hard for the canopener to open them. The puree itself was ok, but I'm surprised that no can was perforated and leaking. I will never order these again.This is the first time I have recieved anything from Amazon that was so poorly packed and damaged. Everything else I have ordered from Amazon has been well packed and in excellent condition. I was very disappointed."
1,Shameful,"Shameful. In the forward, the author acknowledges-- in passing-- the Boswell Sisters and Connee Boswell but doesn't include them in the book. Of all the girl singers from the 1930's, they not only set the pace but so changed music that it is sinful to have omitted them. Further, for Ella Fitzgerald to state that Connee Boswell, a White jazz singer from New Orleans, was her main early influence should stop traffic each time it is acknowledged. The book should be titled ""My Favorite Girl Singers,"" rather than assuming these are the most influential female singers of their generation."
3,Magnificent Voice Marred By Inferior Sound Quality,"Polydor collections often contain great selections, but the sound quality is frequently less than stellar; this is this case here. A huge fan of Warlow, I am disappointed with the inconsistent sound quality of this disc. ""Hiss"" is audible between songs and sometimes during. Sound levels are soft on some pieces and then increase noticably on following numbers. With all the technology available to temper problems, it's a shame that Polydor did not give this magnificent voice the star treatment it deserves."
4,Best Metal Sampler Deal,"This 2CD set from Relapse records is the best deal around to get a large sampling of the different bands this label has signed throughout its ten year history. It has new songs from bands like Origin, Exhumed, Dying Fetus (whom they recently signed on), Neurosis, Incantation, Nasum, Cephalic Carnage, Regurgitation, Luddite Clone and the mighty Nile, alongside classics from bands like Suffocation and Brutal Truth. For less than ten bucks you get like fifty something songs on two CD's. Agreat place to start if your new to the underground metal scene and wnt to know what's out there, or even a scene veteran who want's to hear what the newer bands are up to. For the price, you can't beat it!!"
4,Quaint Romance,Nora Perry was a poet and short story writer during the late 1800s. This book features 10 of her stories. They are old-fashioned but entertaining and an interesting look at the times.
2,Not exactly,"These are advertised as 10 teeth per inch blades - what I received were 10/14 teeth per inch blades. One inch is 10TPI, then the next is 14TPI, alternating all the way down the blade.This isn't such a bad thing and my crews like them so far - just not as advertised. A bit disappointed especially since these are sold by Amazon.The other baffling thing to note is that these were $68 just ONE MONTH AGO - I had planned to re-order a pack in another couple of weeks but now I will be sourcing other avenues. What's the deal with a 30% jump in 30 days Amazon? Now I will question every price on this website that I love."
4,A Different Perspective On Dead Man Walking,"Throughout the time the book and movie concerning Dead Man Walking was the rage, I was troubled because I never believed that the deceased victims of the character played by Sean Penn received their due. I am Catholic and I have tremendous respect for Sister Helen Prejean's sincerity and beliefs. But I am also a former prosecutor and I would rather weep for victims than for killers who are facing electrocution of their own making.Finally, Loss Of Faith offers the answers I was seeking. For the first time I can read about and mourn for the victims of the Dead Man Walking. I finally know the rest of the story --- the part of the story that Sister Helen Prejean and Susan Sarandon and Timothy Bottoms forgot to tell.This book will nag at your conscience and awaken your sense of guilt, because you will realize, as I did, that when we celebrated Dead Man Walking we forgot someone, those victims who died at the hands of a miserable, cowardly killer."
4,cherish the little resister in yourself,"Bartleby's is a negation of the whole of modern, civilized life and the strains and expectations it places on working people. Bartleby, for reasons many of us can share, refuses the whole set-up of his social existence, without though marking a new path or any positive vision of how he and we might live together. Consequently, he ends up destitute and lonely, but true to his stubborn resistance. I think of him often when I see hard-headed five-year olds and how right they so often are in their druthers."
1,STOP LISTENING TO THIS JUNK!,It's rediculous to see that more than half of these reviews gave this CD 5 stars. The Moffatts are doing nothing but copying off of Hanson. Stop acting like Hanson you'll never be like them. My advice to you is to listen to some REAL music this ABOMINABLE MESS!
3,"Well-done, for a genre outing.","Not much to say, really. It's a wonderful album, for what they had to work with. In the tradition of brother harmonies, the blend is smooth and sweet-sounding, and you can quite easily see the effort these guys poured into this album. I was very impressed. ""Misery"" has to be one of my personal favorites, track-wise, though I have to say ""Frustration"" was a very pleasant suprise. Mellow vocals and candelight acoustic guitar from Scott...very appealing, despite the dark sound of the song. But, of course, don't just take my word for it...see for yourself."
5,Perfection in music,"Everyone on earth should own this CD...I guarantee you won't stop listening to it! And don't pay attention to these people going on about Hanson, cos Moffatts have been around since 92 which is more than Hanson can say. These guys are the definition of talent and they will always be a strong force in music. Buy Ch.1!!!"
5,Chapter One *US Version* rocks!,"I've been a HUGE fan of the guys since '95 and I've loved all of their albums..even though some might say that they sounded like chipmunks back then, however, they're very talented boys and they always have been! Chapter 1: A New Beginning is an AWSOME album! And if you think the CD is great, also, you should see them in concert! They are increible! They're so full of energy up there on stage! And you can always count on them to perform their best! In a few more years they're going to be outta this world! They seem that way to me already, but they've improved *never thought it was possible until I saw them last month (June) again* Be sure to go out and buy the album! I'm sure you'll be glad you did! Be sure to listen to ""Misery,"" ""Written All Over My Heart,"" and ""Ranining In My Mind"" =o) -Jo-ee"
5,total cool,"personally i am totally in love with clint. as for the rest of them they're ok. and for the c.d, i loved it."
5,these boys are very talented!!!!,I really enjoy this cd. It has so many different sounds from rock to country to pop to everything in between.
5,This is one of the best CD's my ears have had the pleasure 2,Moffatts: I loved this album. This is the best CD my ears have the pleasure of listening to.
2,An Adult Review,This game is rated for 6 years and up. I bought it for my 6 yr old for Christmas based on another mother whose children play this game and like it. I am a gamer but when I tried this game so I could explain it to my child I couldn't get past the first monster and realized this would be way to frustrating for a 6 yr old to try over and over again at the same task. Buy this only if your child doesn't get frustrated easily. Mine does and won't play it.
1,this game stinks,"this game stinks!you'd probably like to have something like ""Megaman Battle Network"".just remember that this game stinks.I think this game is the worst in the world."
1,Farily useless,This is not a real after sun lotion that will help turn minor sun burn into a tan. It lacks aloe or cocca butter and the herbals are present in too little amounts to make any difference.Strongly scented and over all inferior to Dove or Vasiline moisturizing lotion. Not recommended!
5,Great natural product,"Grew up and spent my whole life using flouride toothpaste. Then I started educating myself about flouride - decided never to use a flouride product again but still wanted that ""minty fresh"" after brushing taste and feel. I live in a rather small city and products like this are unavailable. There is NOT ONE flouride free product sold here. I I know my profile says St. Paul, I've since moved) Anyway, this is the first toothpowder I've ever tried. Used it daily for over a month now and I love it. At first it was difficult to adjust to the saltiness. After wetting your toothbrush, one small squirt of powder is enough so it lasts and lasts, much longer and day by day less expensive. Leaves a great minty fresh taste and NO FLOURIDE. That is the best part. Its smaller, very light, easy to travel with as its not a liquid or gel. Can't say enough positive things.Highly recommend this product and its the only one I'll use from now on."
5,Songwriting still important in American music,"If you can't identify with the lyrics of these singer songwriters then you don't know music. The song is not dead with this band. Listen to their music, read their lyrics and feel their groove and you will have found your new favorite band. Pennsylvania's best kept secret."
2,Takes more than 2 to set up,"Bought this for wife to use at Farmers Market. First it will take more than 2 people to set up, or at least raise the frame, otherwise you bend the trusses. The second time we used this product one of the trusses just snapped at the connection point. Material was similar to that white curtain rod we all know so well. I will contact the company and update this if possible, as to how customer support is."
1,Crapola,"I gave this book every chance to interest me, but gave up by page 100. What a pretentious load of junk. I must be getting old...who are these characters the author writes about? Probably the artsy crowd I avoid at all costs. I hated this drivel."
2,Overly wordy and not at all amusing,"This book was terrible. What appears to be a lighthearted book is in fact completely a chore to finish. The main character was hard to like, confusing and overall extremely wordy. The only reedeeming quality was the best friend of the protagonist, Henry, was refreshing and frank and the only honest person in the entire book."
1,Stay Away!!,"I could barely stomach getting through this book. The author is so worried about sounding intellectual that she made a barely readable book. Of course, the ending was unexpected, and would have been an interesting ending if there was really any revelation behind it. Okay, I get it, Joy doesn't like marriage, but they never really give any substantial or understandable reason for her belief. The characters were either over the top or had no personality, not to mention there were about a hundred too many with about seventeen different unresolved subplots. Stay away from this book- unless you want a headache."
2,I wanted to like this book but couldn't,"I will say upfront that I love chick lit and I really wanted to like this book. However, the Wedding Season was a 330-page disappointment.The characters were alternatively cardboard or unlikable and I thought that none of the situations, conflicts, or tensions were developed enough so I actually cared.The two worst things about the book were the passive aggressive nature of our heroine as it related to the villianess and the ""I just believe in marriage too much"" epiphany. The whole thing was just a little too much to take.Read Bridget Jones Diary again. It's a better use of your time."
3,The Season's Over,"I love books about weddings, considering I'm not a newlywed but still new at marriage. So when I saw The Wedding Season by an author I never read before, I decided to give it a shot.Why oh why did I give it a shot.The story itself was fine, a few surprises here and there, but I generally was not a fan. What kind of world is it when EVERYTHING works out for the best and characters simply learn a valuable lesson here and there? No large embarrassing scenes that make a reader cringe, no arguments...everything was just done so neatly, I was kind of repulsed by the easiness of the characters life (albeit one or two, but you get my drift).The book was okay, and I stress just O-K. Not great, just a quick read that is somewhat entertaining. I think I'll give Ms. Cosper the benefit of the doubt and try another book for now."
3,"boring in the beginning, but picks up towards the end","I thought this would be a fun read and it was...toward the end. The beginning was a big yawner: too many character introductions, too much background flashbacks. The book picks up in the middle and has a decent ending. I didn't find myself caring for any of the other characters or thought they were believable: Gabe, the boyfriend - uses too many cheesy puns; Joy, the drug addict/alcoholic friend - too cliche; and of course, Henry, the bestfriend - too over the top (even in comparion to the gals of Sex & the City.)"
2,Gave me a headache!,"I love musk scents, and this one was recommended to me by a co-worker who loves everything from The Body Shop. Unfortunately, something about this fragrance gave me a horrible headache. I'm not usually prone to headaches, and I've never had a reaction like that to any other perfumes, so I thought maybe it was just a coincidence at first, but I wore it 3 different times, and each time it was the same. It smells okay, but it's not worth the pain!"
5,"Natural, sexy, subtle fragrance","This is pretty much the only perfume I can stand putting on. Everything else, cheap or expensive, smells too cloying or horribly reminiscent of all the times I've been trapped in an elevator or car with a woman wearing too much perfume. This, I love. It's natural and musky, and smells delicious, like a sexy rumpled bed. Instead of shoving its way into the hubby's nostrils (and giving him a headache), it encourages him to lean in for a kiss. Totally worth the money!"
2,Good for 6 months,"This combo unit seemed like a good buy - stylish, functional and reasonably priced. After six months of use - mostly for childrens videos, the playback quality deteriorated - even on brand new tapes, and after several cleanings. Now, a tape will not eject, and that malfunction has caused the entire unit to shut down. So, now I have a brand new tape stuck in the slot, my kids' favorite DVD is stuck in the other drive, and we have to take it in to retrieve our media. What a pain. Now I have read the reviews here, and I realize this product is lousy. Bad choice."
1,Giant Let Down,"I read the reviews prior to ordering this book, but I was hopeful I would find a couple of great nuggets about this wonderful album and prove the other reviewers wrong.Not so. This book is terrible. If you want to learn about the history of the CD, well then, you picked the perfect book. If you want to learn anything about Radiohead and the making of OK Computer, forget it. I seriously want my money back. I feel like if I ever saw this guy walking on the street I would punch him. He had an incredible opportunity to write about one of the best modern bands and one of the best albums of all time - and he blew it."
1,Use Google instead!,"Keep your $10 and search the web instead. 94 small pages. Mostly history, very little info to help you plan your trip. ""A Traveler's Guide"" - I don't think so."
1,Seriously Sad,Badbadbadbad choppy yucky yucky can't even aim worse thanmedal of honor no good yicchy i want my money back yiggy wiggywiggy yiggy yuggy yag
5,Great for Anime,"My daughters love the DVD series. They want season 2 for their birthday. I needed 7 more words from my daughter to end this comment, but she say's i""m bothering her while she wifi's on her iPod. Kids today got it too easy."
5,What kind of Butler?,"THE BEST! I'm really into Anime and i'm particularly a fan of CLAMP but Yana Toboso blew me away with this set of characters. This Anime is hauntingly beautiful with a Faustian plot that just can't go wrong. I streamed the first volume on netflix and I simply couldn't stop watching. I wanted more, so I decided to purchase both volumes 1 & 2 on Amazon. I can't wait to see what happens to Ciel and I can't get enough of the enigmatic and dashingly clever Sebastian and of course Tanaka and the rest. interesting twist on historical events and places as well as magnificent animation. =)"
4,Love this show!,"I bought the first season and the second season together and I was very impressed on how fast they arrived! Two days early, it tickled my fancy and I am watching it right now. The cases and DVDs are in perfect shape and the show is just amazing(though I prefer the manga over the show.) I recommend this for anyone 16+!"
5,Best Rock album of the last 20 years,"A ripper of an album and nothing as great as this has been recorded since maybe 1984 by Rush or King Crimson. It has great tracks like Dotcom, AWOL, Wicked windows, Far Alaska and the dog ear years. There is also a great single from this session called It all trickles down. Other cool songs are Hot mango flush, Spiral and A gift of roses. Hunt by number and Bends like a willow are slighlty commercial sounding, but they are better than most of the crap you hear these days lol"
3,"OK, BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE OLD TULL!","Like many of the other reviewers, I am a long-time Tull fan and have heard every album. I eagerly awaited this new offering, but was not expecting too much. As usual, the professionalism and musical experience of Tull is readily apparent here; however, great technical expertise in instrument playing and mixing does not a good album make. The songwriting must be there first and foremost. Sadly, Ian Anderson's songwriting has taken a slide in recent years and this is apparent on this CD. Perhaps the peak of creativity really is during an individual's 20 and 30s. However, if you truely love Tull, then you should purchase this CD. It is better than ROOTS TO BRANCHES and much of the post-1980s Tull anyway. Just don't expect another SONGS FROM THE WOOD or LIVING IN THE PAST or PASSION PLAY or ..."
4,The first sign of Ian Anderson's resurgence,"Anyone who appreciated Rupi's Dance and The Secret of Language of Birds will also like J-Tull.com. For reasons I have not discovered, Ian Anderson is producing great music once again, music to rival or exceed the high points of the 1970s.This album is a notable achievement, and heavy! You gotta love the powerchords Mr. Barre deals out. This is a long CD with much to admire and Tull fans get their money's worth.And if there is any remaining doubt, go ahead and buy the CD and listen for yourself. You will thank me later."
3,Didn't seem very appealing as a wet food bowl...,"I used this bowl for wet food, not dry, or water, and due to the height of it, my cat seemed to forget a lot that the food was inside.In addition, the bowl is rather small in diameter, possibly being uncomfortable for a cat to eat out of, and the cat figure on top juts into the eating space and really shouldn't be there.If I have anything else to return within 30 days I'm going to send this bowl back with it, if not, I guess I'm just out $6.In addition, Amazon clearly overpackaged this thing like they do with many other items, in a box about ten times the bowl's size, and the box was inside yet another box direct from the manufacturer."
5,Simply the Best!,"I've been collecting concert DVD's since they first came out, and remember the amazement when I first saw (and heard) Fleetwood Mac's ""The Dance"" DVD. The sound of a live concert recorded in true 5.1 surround simply blew me away. And since that first DVD, I've grown my collection to over 30 concert DVD's. - Some have been OK, some have been rather average, and some have been fantastic. This new Sister Hazel concert defiantly falls in the later category. It's really a two-in-one bonus. The full-length documentary is as funny as it is insightful as to how these guys live. The Concert portion's sound is top notch. And the visuals are stunning. No washed out shots in this one. The colors look as good as really being at the show.Few concert DVDs capture the ""Live"" feeling as well as ""A Life in the Day"" does. This is truly a new benchmark for concert recordings - and is a must have in anyone's collection."
3,Meh...,"The effects of this product were less-dramatic than what I had hoped. My complexion improved, but did not noticeably lighten. I suspect the most active ingredient at work was the sunscreen. The cream is actually a soft wax that becomes very uncomfortable with long hair and bothersome when perspiring. I tried applying before bed to feel my skin stick to the fabric and leave smears on my pillow. Sweating after application is dangerous, as the oil can get into your eyes. And it can take a few hours to be fully absorbed, leaving the consumer to grapple with these nuisances for a good part of their day, if used as directed. The search continues..."
4,Great Read,This book is informative and entertaining.Anyone in management or in any position of leadership should read this book.Pat's anecdotes are great.
3,Remote Control design is frustrating,"I am a fan of toshiba since I've owned several of their televisions and have admired their reliability and performance. I recently purchased the Toshiba SDV 390 dual vcr/cd unit to go with a new wide screen Toshiba television set. I am really disappointed in the remote control for this unit. It is almost impossible to figure out with dual function buttons everywhere, poorly placed, and hard to read lableing. Vcr and CD functions are intermixed and confusing. This is not what I would have ecpected from Toshiba engineering. The unit itself seems to perform well but this remote control stand between us."
3,Air Filters,We always use these filters but they are hard to find but Amazon has them at the least expensive price.
3,Not The Best of Winsor Pilates,"First of all, I have a sensitivity to Latex and the weighted bar contains it. It has an unpleasant smell that stays on your hands even after washing.I was not crazy about the workouts. Instead of the moves/exercizes being different, they are very similar. I liked the old Winsor Pilates set of DVD's."
3,For Beginning Beginners!,"First of all, there were no assembly instructions included in the pack. Although it is easy to assemble, you will have to look at the picture on the box and guess how everything is meant to connect to each other. I would have thought putting a simple instruction leaflet would not have been overlooked.Secondly, there is hardly any tension provided for good resistance. My eight year old daughter had no problem pulling it. For people already into muscle toning and exercise, forget this one. This is like for beginning beginners! Definitely not for men. However,that's not to say it wont work. i have not tried it long enough yet. I will post a further review after a couple of weeks. I will definitely say this is not meant for most men. Too light and too little resistance. the Dvd's are good though and well made."
4,Delightful book,This was a favorite of my son when he was a child and I had forgotten what a charming tale it is. The book arrived in like-new condition.
5,"Fantastic Product, Well Designed","Durable Simple and built to last. So, many products are somewhat like this, however this one can be left on the tool and sets up in seconds to make circles or cut edging and molding. Look careful at the competition this one is worth the investment and designed by a nice guy (one man company) in New Hampshire that takes pride in his product and quality control. Fits common brass spacers and most popular routers. If needed he can sell you a universal adapter for odd routers like mine. Also he sells plunge cut bits direct too. Speaker builders rejoice this is the ""Secret Weapon"""
2,Takes way too many layers to make even Translucent,I do love most of opi products. This one is almost clear for the first three coats. gets kinda pink after the fourth coat. I do not really like it you have to put it on so thick if you bump your top coat the whole top layer shifts. I am extreemely rough on my nails and dont like to be gentle with them. so this may be alright for some and it does go on fairly smooth. I just don't like it it's just too thick when you get it looking like the picture.
1,Sucky nail polish please don't waste your money!,I thought this was a pretty light pink nail polish color. BUT the brush sucks! It leaves it uneven and you have to put 3-4 coats on to see the color. Don't waste your money! OPI nail polishes suck!
4,Great Seller and Product...,"The real thing and the seller promptly sent the product with a free Winnie the Pooh nail file (nice touch). Unfortunately, it was put into a padded envelope, which might be good enough if mailed in the States, but I am currently working in Iraq so maybe the added shipping (military postal service) made it worse, and it came broken at the neck... a little was left so I was able to use some:( Next time, I'd put in a small box, with padding to ensure safe delivery. Otherwise, nothing negative to say."
1,Stay away.....!,Weak laser is the best description I can give you... The LED light is blue not clear as I thought. This is a novelty pen worth 1.99 at the very best.... Stay clear....
1,"I didn't believe other's review, now I regret","I should say I didn't believe that this product is as crappy as other reviewers described. Because I really like some of HP products, especially HP has been in ADF scanner business for so many years.So I went ahead and bought a HP 5550C with thoughts that I (as a computer professional with 12 experience and a former HP employee) can manage to make it work.But clearly I'm wrong, and so wrong that the 5550C software is by far the worst software I have ever seen!!! I really do not understand that why HP even bothers to release this product to market, and HP should really ""fire"" the software team and the QA team for doing nothing but damaging its reputation.I agree with other reviewers completely. The 5550C hardware looks well constructed and sturdy. The problem comes from the software piece.Sigh ...."
1,Release of this software is inexcusable,After struggling with this scanner for over a year I finally replaced it with the scanjet 5590 which does everything that the 5550 was supposed to do. Physically the two scanners are identical on the feature set and form factor down to the buttons and hinges. The difference is that the 5590 comes with HP director software version 2.5. The 5550 uses version 2.0. The HP scanning software 2.0 does not load completely on windows 2000 precluding access to adjustments in scanning settings and changes in the default settings. Getting it to work at all took hours and each scan had to be have settings individually set up for an office trying to automate record keeping. What a waste of time and money. HP should give a full refund or replacement for every one of these they foisted on unwitting customers.
2,Not impressed....,"The beginning of this cd is alright, but towards the end I wanted to claw the walls...very annoying and repetitive....."
4,Fun but not for kids,"This game is pretty darn fun. It took a minute to get the controls down and to understand what is going on but once you do get it is is fun. The game play, the challenges and the variety is extraordinary. You can replay a level 30 times and still get something new out of it."
3,Far Too Short,"This game is really fun, but ridiculously short. I rented it (so I'm not talking about the 3 level demo) and I finished the entire game in about 5-6 hours. True, I didn't get 5 stars on EVERY track, but nearly. I played all the levels, and the constructor, and the comercials, and whatever else opened up. If I had paid $60 for this game, I would be quite angry at the length (or lack thereof). Don't waste your money, rent it."
4,Minestrone,"This music is lip-smackingly rich and thick, like a really good minestrone soup. Hamelin is pianism of the first order, busily and sometimes poundingly accompanying the full orchestra through an unusal 8-part ""concerto,"" a daunting 72 minute Herculean opus. After several listenings I still haven't grasped the themes or larger architecture of this lyrical work, a great wall of background sound; it would probably take many more. It seems a generaly upbeat paean to civilization (clearest in the text of the men's chorus), with no hint of the dissolution to come in WW I. However, there is no attempt to imitate or suggest the musics of the three ancient civilizations Busoni invokes (in his frontispiece drawing) as the architectural underpinnings of this sprawling work. The notes (written in 1958) are extremely detailed, but would be more comprehensible if keyed to the timings of each long and busy movement (10-23 min each, slightly faster than ""usual"")."
2,Save your money!,"Remember those fluffy Life 101 books - the ones written on only half a page, with some dippy quote on the other page? Fisher's books use extra wide margins and line spacing. Save your money for books with substance, like Peter Lynch's ""Learn to Earn,"" Ben Stein's ""Bunkhouse Logic,"" or Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich."""
5,One of the best movies of 2007/08,"Without a doubt, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is one of his best films and one of the best films of 2007/08. Much better then ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""There will be Blood"". I also believe this is the best version of the story to. The visionary and music was perfect.Cant wait to get this on blu-ray."
1,Poor audio control and whole movie was too dark,"The audio control was poor, dialogs between actors were verbally soft followed by sudden raise of music with orchestra background. You then gotta lower the TV volume as it was too loud. When it is back to the 'talking' part I gotta increase the volume back (it was too soft). Did anyone experience this? or it was my player?Also the whole movie was relatively too dark. The extras were better lighted."
1,No fun at all,"I thought that this was just about the most repulsive movie I've ever seen - and not just because it was a musical! The blood and guts were a bit much, and all of the throat slitting and waterfalls of blood was putridly excessive, not to mention the awful, soulless ""songs"" that they sang! I thought it would be good fun watching Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie where he wasn't Borat or Ali G, but the ""duel"" that he ""fought"" with Sweeney Todd just didn't make any sense. Helena Bonham Carter, who is very attractive, is difficult to look at when she's made up in Marilyn Manson corpse make-up. I thought that Tim Burton would try to infuse at least some sort of dark humour into this story of a sort-of-sympathetic serial killer, but I'm not sure he even tried this time around since the film is really as gothic as it wants to be. Not recommended."
5,It's a good movie,There was nothing wrong with my dvd. It came on time and was the quality I was expecting. I love Sweeny Todd.
5,Awesome on blu ray,I like this movie much more now that I have seen it on blu ray. It really brings the story to life even though the blood now looks really fake.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I sat all the way through this movie, the entire time wondering when it was going to get good. It didn't. I will confess that the music was very well written and quite beautiful -- which is why I'm rating this movie 2 stars instead of 1. But other than that, the whole thing was awful. The plot, the character development (or lack thereof), the lyrics -- all ridiculous. If you haven't seen it, I can sum it up in one sentence (spoiler warning): A wronged man comes back from his prison sentence, goes crazy and kills everyone, including his wife, and then is killed by his own blade. Oh, the irony.Seriously, you can find a better use for this movie than to watch it. Set it on fire or something. It'll be more entertaining."
5,Awesome,This one of the best musicals that I have seen in a very long time. Mr. Depp is an incredible actor. His acting skill is up there with Jimmy Stewart.
5,How everything should be!,One word: Amazing. It came within two days..it was sealed nicely...packed nicely and played perfectly...all in all it was perfect. No complaints here!
4,Good Movie,"I don't recommend it for everybody. The story is hard to take, but it's well written, the music is great and the acting and was excellent. The singing was OK!"
5,amazing film,absolutely incredible musical. I recommend anyone that loves musicals and johnny depp. Tim burton always makes the most fantastic films
5,Great Movie!,This is visually stunning and it has an amazing cast. If you love Harry Potter this will interest you beccause quite a few members of the cast are part of this film! You can see how varied and great their talent is.
2,What a joke!,"So bad, what a joke. The actors are great ACTORS but not singers and there is just too much singing! If you like movies that sing 98% of the time instead of talking (like Rent), you will love this - we did not. Too bad that with such great acting and great sets and costumes, they had to muck it up with entirely too many songs and too little dialogue in between. This R rated scary movie musical really failed. The special effects also lacked, the spurting blood looked pretty fake - we just could not take it seriously. We were afraid it woud be too scary to watch, but we laughed throughout the entire thing. We would really love to see this re-written without the singing."
4,Fascinating,"He took his revenge the only way he knew how. Demon, no way! More like an avenging angel. Now this is one Johnny Depp movie I could enjoy. He plays weird characters, but this time a hostorical figure who actually made news. It wasn't so bloody. The music was effective. The ending was sad as his dearly loved was also dearly departed at his own hands. At he end, all of the guilty and some of the bystanders meet a gory fate. Go see this first rate movie and laugh."
1,Garbage,I was totally disapointed after the hype over this movie I thought it was total trash. At no stage did anyone tell me this was a musical and if I had that info I would not have brought it. I am a firm fan of Johnny Depps work but this movie has driven me past my limit. The only musical I like is THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I don't think the Von Trapp family cut anyones throut. Tim Burton you suck.
2,Dull,"This is a musical: It should have good music, not bad. It should be entertaining, not boring. Ben & Arthur was more entertaining."
3,Missing in Action,"I bought this DVD with the hope of clarifying some of the details that confused me about the stage version. The good news is that the mood of living in London during this historical period was conveyed much more vividly than had been done on the stage. The bad news was that there was much less attention given to the musical qualities of the work. The worst news was that Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue was almost completely incomprehensible -- owing to her strong accent and low-volume mumbling style of speech. I agree that she gives a great visual impression of the role, but I'm still trying to figure out some of the relationships that I missed in the theater. No amount of fiddling with the volume control could help."
5,Geeeeee Beeeeeeee (G B),"GRUESOMELY BEAUTIFUL. . .This movie is gruesomely beautiful. The storyline is bizarre, the scenes grotesque, the costuming and make-up are magnificently dark, the score is morbidly complex, the actors are macabre-ly on the money. These elements combined to result in a work of art that is gruesomely beautiful."
4,Movies that make you go hmmmm....,"I must admit we watched this movie purely because it stars Johnny Depp and we know we like most of the movies he's in. We knew nothing more about the movie prior to purchasing it.Imagine our surprise when everyone in the cast (including Johnny) started singing! It's a musical. We were disappointed from the get-go....but I must say, we actually enjoyed the movie. It took about 20 minutes to get used to the format. Not that I'm against musicals mind you -- I just prefer them at the theatre when I'm already prepared to hear all the actors sing their lines.The plot was interesting, and the ending had an unexpected twist. I enjoyed the story-line very much. The acting was great, the singing was okay, and the set and costumes were perfect.Be aware, this movie is VERY bloody."
5,Oki C5300 Black Image Drum,This image drum resolved my problem when I installed it. The only problem I had was the distributor took so long to deliver the item. Online it stated that delivery of the item by surface mail should take 5-7 days. I didn't get the item 'til sixteen days after.
5,A breath of fresh air!,"The casualites of recreational dating have mounted in our generation; and this book reminds fathers: It is OUR responsibility to lovingly protect our daughters. Their purity rests with us. I urge every Dad who loves their little pumpkin the way I love mine to get this book...Learn the Biblical mandate well, when she is young. She'll love you, and thank you for it during the teenage years;and especially in marriage.Peter Hyatt, Copiague, New York"
3,Sex manual in Spanish,"The reader should disregard my rating of this book, as I am not prepared to evaluate it. I just wanted to point out that this book (ISBN 968-890-569-0) is in Spanish, not in English, as indicated in the above description. The book appears to be more of a (very explicitly illustrated)how-to manual rather than a medical encyclopedia, although I suppose it is encyclopedic to the extent that it describes about every method and position for persons of various sexual orientations (mostly hetero)."
4,Good Set,With Michael Mcdonald He has always Been Bad and He has the Cuts Here that still Stand Out but I Always Felt like He had this Secret Album that Really Fully Showcased His Full Musical Range.this Album is Good but you have Some material that doesn't do Him His Justice.The Man Still has a Cool Voice&Pressence.this a Cool Collection but I Still Feel he has even better Work that hasn't Surfaced.Still this is a Good Buy.
4,Boston Alternative circa 1992-- my early buglary years,"This, along with become what you are, was a staple of my early JH stages. Dino Jr, Buffalo Tom, Gigolo Aunts, all of these have a special place in the cultural pantheon of the early 90's in Boston. While the clubs have come and gone, and some have stayed and changed, I forever have this music to remember a turbulent time in my development into maturity. Thanks, Juliana!"
4,Awesome solo debut!,"I have all of the Juliana Hatfield CD's and now many years later still go back to this one quite often. Cool sounds and interesting lyrics are all over this disc and the only rival was ""Become What You Are"". If you only know JH for ""My Sister"" and ""Spin The Bottle"" get this CD too!"
3,"Pretty good, but she gets better...","I think she's still finding herself on this album...Some of the songs I did enjoy, others were just okay. The alternative pop is edgy and overall this album is pretty good."
3,Thinking of quitting anything? Watch this...,"A very good film, and it helps if you're struggling with addiction. You'll learn that there are many, many others out there going through the same thing, and Keaton is always pretty funny, even in his most serious roles."
2,"Heavy, clunky & the crystal scratches if you look at it wrong","Bought one of these as the replacement for a 7 or 8 year old Pulsar Solar watch that I had worn much and liked a lot. The old one died after I managed to strike a glancing blow on the crystal. On the strength of my very good experience with the old Pulsar Solar, I ordered one of these. Hate it.This is a large, thick and heavy watch. So much so, that I find its weight on my wrist annoying. But the worst ""feature"" is that the crystal scratches if you merely look at it wrong. My watch developed noticeable scratches after the first 24 hours of wear. In contrast my 7 year old Pulsar Solar still looked great (and scratch free) up until I managed to accidentally destroy its crystal.This watch is obviously designed for people who do not actually wear their watches outside. Not recommended."
2,More outdated then an 8-track,"If the author writes another guide that has up-to-date with entries on all of the new characters and places et cetera that had come out since '94, maybe I'll buy it"
3,Good product,When we received the microwave we were disappointed that the latch to open the door did not work. However we contacted Amazon & they sent UPS to pick that one up & sent us another one from Fex Ex the next day & it works fine. We were very happy with Amazon customer service. The product works well I have to get used to it I always had a Sharp. It is a little higher watts so I have to get used to it cooking faster. I used to have buttons to push for designated cooking on the Sharp not so much on this but the sensor feature works well. It was $30 cheaper on Amazon than if we bought it at Best Buy plus free shipping & no tax! Overall very pleased it is a good product.
1,Failed longevity,"Purchased this item on 1-13-12. Delivered on or about 1-20-12. Died on 1-31-12.The unit was fine in the morning but by evening would only work for 2 seconds at a time. No error message, just no power and a blank display. Nearest repair facility is 42 miles away. Made the mistake of throwing away the box believing that the Panasonic brand would be a good indicator of longevity. (Prior Sharp carousel lasted 17 years)Repair facilities (3 queried) could not guarantee a one day turnaround and estimated repair time was one to three weeks. 42 miles x 4 equates to a significant time and gas cost figure.To say I am not impressed would be a significant understatement."
4,Dan,We replaced an old worn out Panasonic with this unit. So far we're very pleased with the new unit's performance. I would recomend it to a friend.
4,Panasonic NN-765BF Genius 1.6 cf 1250 Watt Sensor Microwave,Had this microwave for a long time and it is exceptional in it ease of operation and dependability. Would buy another one
5,Excellent Product,"This is a great microwave. It has a lot of features I'll probably never get around to using, but it's nice that they are there for those who will use them. I love the Quick Minute button since a minute is a perfect amount of time for heating a cup of coffee.I would definitely recommend this for purchase."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Noisy, hard to read digital numbers, shows every finger and hand print and it has an inverter, which it doesn't mention in the ad! Inverters make the unit disposable, too costly to repair! Panasonic is bad for this!"
5,Perfect for my needs,This such a nice microwave. It is full size and has plenty of settings. All the other excellent reviews are correct. Thanks Amazon.com
1,Died in 55 Days,"It was fine while it lasted, but it didn't last long. This microwave stopped working just 55 days of light usage after we got it. During those 55 days, we were actually on vacation for a week and a half, so the actual usage on it was even lower.It was only used for the typical re-heating of foods; no crazy baking or cooking projects or anything. It did not give any warning it was failing, just one day started throwing an ""H98"" error on the display. The manual offers no help, and just says to take it to a service center. Panasonic said the same thing. Seems like it is probably the magnetron. The timer, etc. works fine, and the fan still blows air, just nothing gets heated. I'm off to find out how good Panasonic's warranty service is.On the plus side, Amazon was great about it and gave me a full refund for the failure. If it isn't fixable, I am definitely getting another (non-Panasonic) microwave oven from Amazon."
2,Too much current,"The oven arrived quickly and cooked fine, but it kept tripping the circuit breaker. A quick investigation showed the cause: instead of drawing the 12.7 Amps that the manual specifies, it was drawing more like 17 Amps! That seemed dangerous, and might mean that it would fail soon, so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement.Amazon made it easy to replace, but when the second microwave arrived, it had exactly the same problem! I call Panasonic technical support, and they claimed that the 12.7 A spec was correct, and that there was no recall. They offered to pay to have a repairman look at it and try to fix it, but at this point I'm just going to get a refund and try a different brand. Which is a shame, because I liked the features and how cooked, right up until the lights went out.If you have a 20 Amp dedicated circuit for your microwave, you might not notice this problem, but it would make me nervous to know that an appliance is using so much more power than it was rated for."
4,Good so far,"So far so good. Its a bit on the loud side, though nothing dramatic. Shorter inside height then I'm used to, though I had a 2.2 cubit foot size one before this. Bought this to replace a 2 yr old Panasonic that died recently. Little bit worried it might die on me again so I went a little cheaper then my last one. Overall good experience so far."
1,Died after 2 years,"Worked fine but died after just 2 years. Out of warranty, of course.A pricey, brand name appliance should last longer than that. Next one won't be a Panasonic."
4,Good microwave!,"Panasonic makes a good microwave. Easy to use...our last one is still working well at 6 years old but we switched colors in our kitchen. The sensor reheat is great! No problem, good-working microwave."
5,Happy customer!!,"I love it! Great product! Great price! Our last microwave wouldn't even pop popcorn. This one does great. It's the perfect size, and has cool features. My husband had never shopped on-line before, so he was very skeptical. But now he loves Amazon, and our new microwave!"
3,This is JCS?,"When i first heard their last album, I was hooked. It had a heaviness and lightness to it that balenced off and was great. Then I saw the ""Do Right"" video and loved the song, so picked this up as quick as I could. When I listened to it I was dissapointed. They changed. Their style is different, and it's not as good as their previous albums. This CD is still good, but it's not the JCS I know. There's a parental advisory on it and there's nothing offensive in the CD, minus, like, 3 words. A dissapointment from what used to be a much better band."
3,Thirteen - Tales of Horror by Masters of Horror,"Good Book. I say that this book is a great way to find new authors. The stories of the book go both ways, from good to bad. Christopher Pike is a great author, with a beautiful way of writing, while D.E. Athkins, (in my opinion) is writing more for a little kid, than a young adult. Although your opinion will switch from story to story, this is a great instrument to gain new insight to authors you never would think of reading. I give this book 3 stars. I feel it could have more suspense and sometimes better writers. None the less, I feel it is a great 'light' book. You can use this book on a trip or just if you want to relax. The short stories are a great way of letting go for a little while. Sit back and enjoy"
4,'Daddy' with Lynda Carter,"Hi. A typical made for TV movie starring the lovely Lynda Carter... OK, there are a few other folks in it... nothing else to say if you love Miss Lynda!! }:o)"
1,Don't Stand by this Man,"Patrick Duffy stars as an ad exec whose family breaks up after his wife (Kate Mulgrew) leaves his overbearing, manly and pushy tendencies in search of fulfillment as a woman. Enter Lynda Carter the actress who believes it is a woman's duty to stand by her man. Duffy and Carter click. Frankly, Danielle Steele's ""Daddy"" is syrupy sweet and stomach turning. It's a kick in the face for any woman who wants to be more than a housewife and baby machine."
5,To watch not only on a rainy day.,Linda Carter is beautiful as she can be. Love the movie. Patrick Duffy melts your heart. Ben Affleck young and handsome. Love the decor of the homes.
1,Sllllloooooowww shutter,"Once you take the picture the is camera incredibly slow and delayed in actually taking the picture. Unless you have a very patient target many times you will lose the moment or end up with a moving target due to this long delay. So slow I would never recommend this camera. Many times I end up taking moveis vs. pictures too, in error. I am absolutely NOT a professional, but do have common sense and it tells me this camera is no good for an average user. I purchased based on the positive reviews, but have to 100% disagree."
2,Am I doing something wrong????,"So slow to respond! I got this as a Christmas gift and tried to take pictures of the kids, but the 2 second delay between hitting the capture button and the actual image recording meant that the kids were either looking away or had walked out of frame by the time it took.I have had 2 other dig cameras in the past, and my 4 year old cannon digital elph was much better. I asked for this because I eventually broke the elph due to rough usage and was really surprised how bad this was. Ended up using the disposable slr for all my Christmas shots.The design of the body and the screen and image quality are pretty impressive. I will try to find something in settings to improve the record speed, but so far, overall very dissapointing!"
1,Useless banjo tuner,Farley Pockettones Banjo Tuner was a dud. Ordered one for me and one for a gift. Neither worked. Complete waste of money.
3,"M and Ms melt in your mouth, not your hands","I can't seem to find the twix box at my grocery store with 11 candy bars, and only 25 cents each one. Call me a cheapskate, but with postage the lowest is about 35 cents each in twin packs that melt together at room temperature. At least offer customers a discount for buying large boxes through the mail."
5,"Heartwarming, A Good Feel Movie.",This film is beautifuly acted and directed. It's based on a true story and will definetly touch your heart. Buy it you won't be dissapointed.
1,Vulgar,Absolutely vulgar! Breakneck speed presses the music into mush. What are you guys hearing out there? Surely not Bach. It's all about the performer here and not the composer. For those who recommend this cd I suggest you dip into the writings of Robert Schumann. If he were alive he would be appalled at the unmusicality of this performance.
2,I expected more ...,I expected more from this product.I did not find it all that is described.the scent does not remain for very long.
2,Wish this lasted longer,"I was in love with this microwave casserole dish. Unfortunately it didn't last a year. When it arrived the lid was cracked - no big deal, I didn't plan on using it for food storage. The dish itself cracked last time I used it. I don't have a dishwasher, and maybe used it twice a month since I bought it in January. I'm not sure why it cracked - I just know that I'm not buying another one."
4,"Excellent racing history, weak engineering and road reviews.","Ryder's book is a detailed read, mostly to be enjoyed by the historical racing fan. I was looking for content on the Honda V-4 engineering, development, and rider impressions over its history and was dissappointed at the light coverage. That's not to say that the racing history is well-written and enjoyable, just not my principle goal. The chapters are mostly split between racing and production V-4s. Once I realized this my second read was more enjoyable. I still would have appreciated more engineering analysis/discussion/diagrams."
5,very good!,"This book arrived in perfect condition, just about as new. It had obviously been taken care of. If you are a Honda V4 fan, this is the book for you."
5,Can't wait to fill it up,My husband and I recieved this photo book as a shower gift and it is just so cute! With two 4x6 pockets on each side of a page and a few lines right next to each picture for captions it is a great way to keep record of all your little ones moments without going through a huge scrapbooking project. The lighter blue on the cover is a fabric-like material which shows unexpected quality. We can't wait to fill this one up with pictures of our new son!
2,Too much technical info and a tough read,"I recently purchased the Nikon D70 and have no idea how to use all the features to get great pictures. So I buy a book to learn right? Well this book talks down to a yahoo like me. He plugs his other books all the time and makes comments like ""I won't get into setting exposures. If you've purchased a DSLR, you obviously know about that"". Well I didn't know about and so I never fully grasped his book.He gets into the technical aspects way too much also, which I didn't care about. I really don't care how the camera sensor retains the data, I just wanted to take good pictures. Boring.He doesn't even tell you how to take a good picture until page 129. Well by that time he'd lost me, because his writing style is tough to read anyways.I will say though, if you are interested in learning the evolution of the digital camera, how it works and David Busch's past exploits in photography, then this book is for you. In fact I have one you can buy..."
3,"Good, here's better","Packed with useful information to help you understand your camera and how it works, illustrated with uninspiring photos. For a fast track to better photos, an introduction to exposure, a quantum leap in the percentage of keepers, and stunning photos that teach each concept,Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)is more effective, more inspiring, and an easy read, to boot."
3,Covers all the bases... barely,"I've been into photography since December '07 and I purchased this book hoping to improve my technique somewhat. But in all 300 pages of this book I really didn't learn anything that would improve my skill.Some of the things he talks about in the book ARE interesting, but completely not relevant to photography. For example, page after page he explains different image compression techniques, or how a CMOS works vs a CCD. Great.. how does this help me master how to use a dSLR? If you've JUST bought a dSLR (say, within the last week or two) and want to move up from Green Box mode then this may be for you. Otherwise look elsewhere."
2,Needs a good editor,"I know bad reviews get rated as ""not helpful"", but I'll put this in anyway in case it helps someone who is really trying to master digital SLR. I found this very repetitive and dull. The photographic reproductions are very poor. Too much ""digital history"" weighed this down and the author makes continuous references and plugs for his previous books. He should have started this one where his other books left off and not made continuous summaries and references to his previous book. It came across very ""cut and paste"". Very annoying. The glossary is the saving grace and why I gave it two, rather than no stars. Very disappointing because this genre needs a good bible. An attentive publisher and editor could have trimmed this into a useful reference."
3,Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki Box Set,"In this series, many of Ayeka and Sasami's relatives come down to earth to share some exciting news with Tenchi. For those of you who may have seen episodes on Cartoon Network, the series is the one where Ryo Ohki is a child-like creature instead of her usual bunny sized self. I recomend this Tenchi series for the more die hard Tenchi fans out there; although there are humorous moments, this series is more dramatic than other series like Tenchi in Tokyo or Tenchi Universe. It is a little short also. Mihoshi fans, definately check this set out, for Kione fans, sorry, she's is not in this series."
2,False Advertisment,"It says on the cover that this is The Complete Series. It is in fact the last 7 episodes to a 20 episode series. AKA: You get ripped off.The Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki series is in fact the first series in the Tenchi Muyo universe. It was released in 3 OVA seasons. The first season had 7 episodes in it, and the second had 6. Both of those seasons were played on Cartoon Network back in 2000 on Toonami. OVA Season 3 is what you get if you buy this item. It is simply the last 7 episodes to the entire series, along with some bonus material."
4,Why?,"The Tenchi series is a really good, but WHY? This series was good but there are still some loose ends to the story. The characters all somewhat the same. It seemed that their personalities were changed a little.If the makers of the Tenchi series do read this PLEASE TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!"
3,The Review,"I just bought this a few days ago. Kind of upset because i was EXPECTING the whole thing from start to finish but in fact i ended up with the tail end of the show.The Cover clearly states that you are buying the whole thing but in fact you are just buying the last few episodes.In my opinion, unless you have the other episodes to complete the Ryo-Ohki set, dont bother buying this item."
2,stinky,"falls apart easy. Un durable. Worked for about 3 days before the trigger broke. DON""T GET!!!!!!"
3,realistic,a realistic fighting game but it does not have good graphics and modelings. Many unlockable fighters and moves. The heating feels great in this game.
3,The Journey,"This wasn't a bad book, per se. The beginning was interesting, but towards the middle it got boring, and by the end, I just wanted it to end already. The Test is much better."
5,Like Being There All Over Again.,"Being a Marine in Charlie Battery, I was one of the first to read this book. It was like going through it all over again. I remembered the long nights before the war & of course the sleepless ones during the battle of An-Nas. I Recomend this book to anyone that questions the importance of Marine Artillery. Great book for any reader!"
2,"Not so ""Harrowing"" and Not too ""Personal""","If you're an average person looking for a ""harrowing and personal account of a...fight for survival"" (description taken from the flap of this book) ... this ain't it. If your interest is in the emotional impact on the soldiers -- how it affected them and what personal changes they went through as a result -- that just wasn't here. (Truly ""personal"" and ""harrowing"" is David Bellavia's ""House to House."") If, however, you want a history lesson (or a timeline of events), this is the book for you."
5,My experience,"Well, I can't sit here and talk all day about a book that I lived. but I'll try to keep it short.This book was written with incredible detail. I will never forget the people, friends and fellow Marines in this book. It is a vast amount of memories that will be with me until I die. It was kind of hard to keep up with the events as they were unfolding back then.Things happened fast and sudden. A lot of times the lack of sleep, and the fatigue wouldn't let you think of, ""What just happened?"", but having this book that I can pick up whenever to remember those times, and the day where I can show my grandkids what grandpa did is a gift. I will never forget my time in the Corps,or the man who wrote about us Marines in Charlie. Now I know why Vietnam vets still keep in contact with each other. I do with the Marines in this book. I will never forget who they were, what they're hometown was, or the times we went through together. Nothing could ever take the brotherhood away from us.Semper Fi"
3,Good to Grease the Creative Cogs.,"This book ranges from the simple and straight forward to the fancifully ornate. It is just what the title suggests, merely a collection. 1000 pieces on display, not discussed. So, if you're needing a case study, this isn't the book for you. But if you'd like a solid reference for your design library, then by all means, add this one. There's plenty of examples inside to spark your imagination."
3,Not easy to understand.,"I ordered this book because its required reading for my English essay class. Strongly advice you order the Cliff Notes to accompany this Shakespeare play, and you might want to order the DVD movie version as well. You can also research the basics of the story at Wikepedia and other websites if you google or Yahoo ""Othello."""
2,Fell apart,We loved this bench and started usuing it once a week for our soccer games in January. With in 8 games the bench started to fall apart! The bag could not support the weight of the bench and the sides completely ripped apart. Then the underlying plasic layer that helped to reinforce the bench underneath the seats separated and is just hanging there. I was very disappointed that I couldnt even get 1 season out of this bench. Now I have to look for another for our new team.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,Purchased this bench on 8-13-07. We just used it for the first time (U11 Girls) and the water proof lining is already starting to seperate underneath the seats!! The company is a pain to work with in sending it back. There must be better benches out there somewhere!! ABSOLUTE JUNK!!
4,A place to rest,Very useful in keeping the team together during the game. Provides a place to rest on the sideline rather than sitting on wet grass or dirt.
2,Poor quality,"The keys stick regularly, putting additional numbers into an equation. This alone makes the calculator essentially useless ifone is looking for accurate answers."
2,ladybug license plate plastic cover,I liked it when I got it but the ladybugs have faded almost completely away. The red paint will not hold up to sunlight.
3,A bit flimsy,"Nice driving glasses, very lite weight and comfortable. These stay in the car so I always have them. If your expecting glass lenses don't buy these, lenses are plastic..."
3,"Good overall, but never really delivered (no pun intended)","Overall, the DVD's and CD's helped me during the birthing. I was able to relax, and keep my wits about me until about 6 hours into labor. That is when the more severe surges began. At that point, no amount of concentration, breathing, or finger drops were enough to prevent my whole body from tensing. I did, eventually, have to resort to an epidural, although I was 4 cm dilated by then. My husband's help, in reassurring me, and massaging/tickling my lower back was invaluable.I would recommend your significant other or support system view the DVD and listen to the CDs with you.Lastly, I should note that the DVD was VERY poor film quality. It looked as though it were shot, and probably was, in someone's house with an old camera. With that said, that didn't necessarily change the efficacy of the message, just it's delivery."
3,Not Sure,"The device was delivered on time and in seemingly good condition.The DVI Adapter did not work. I don't know if I ordered the wrong adapter or what.I have a Dell laptop and I purchased an Acer flat-screen monitor. The monitor came with a DVI cable, but my laptop has a VGA port. When the adapter arrived I connected it to the DVI cable and the VGA port on my laptop, but the screen could not receive a signal.Before purchasing, I did no research to determine if I needed a certain type of DVI => VGA adapter. So I'm not sure."
4,Stella Dysart,Very good book about the life of a young women that was promoting oil lease and wildcatting in the Ambrosia Lake area of New Mexico. This a business that men dominate and was very rare for a women to be in. Her drilling lead to the discovery of urainum in the early 1950's.
5,Cute Story!,"Such a cute story! I read it to both my preschool and pre-k classes and their eyes were glued to the pages. I love stories that allow me to not only entertain but also teach, and this story does just that! We had fun in our discussions about what we could do with a box and where we would take our ""book box""."
3,"Descent book, Aimed at lower-end users","This book contains a goodly amount of information concerning the basic functionality, and some of the slightly more advanced features, but it describes the use of tools that any user with even a few months of the experience would have already had a great amount of experience using just in basic scene-creation. Topics like bump-mapping, attenuation of lighting, and the effects panel are over-covered. This book is biased toward the begginer that wants to know how to exploit the most out of basic functions that are included with MAX. If you understand the basics of MAX, buying this book would be a waste of cash."
2,I am not a huge fan of it,"On this album is decent alt-rock music. That said, I think it really suffers from bad production. I can't understand the lyrics at all. The vocals are in the background, buried under layers of distortion. Listening through the album, I had the feeling there were two vocalists. One was fairly mumbly, (sang Shine, among other) and one had a clearer voice (Sang Don't be late). The music is fairly interesting, but perhaps could have been more uptempo. When I listened right through 'Rust' struck me as a stand-out track, and I also liked 'Don't Be Late' and 'Second Skin' was also fairly good, but none of the other tracks really stuck out. They were okay, disonant chords and 90's-rock distortion and decent melodies, but the vocals are just too buried in the mix."
2,Disappointment,"I have listened several times and I keep trying to like it, but the harsh truth is that this is a big disappointment. I don't understand why this album keeps popping up on the ""best of"" lists, perhaps because the competition is so lame. This CD is a sad follow-up to Guru's excellent series, and I echo those who have said that the whole enterprise of melding hip-hop/rap with Jazz seems to have been lost on this CD. Instead, tired pop favorites collaborate. Yes there are a few good tracks, but my advice is don't bother with this release. Save your money."
3,"Where's the Jazz, Keith?","Disregarding the absence of jazz on this album, (Although we do get Herbie) this album still delivers.Very smooth production and an over breezey feel to this album makes it very enjoyable.I agree with the guy who said this was commercial... I don't care if it's ""underground"" or not, because that aspect wouldn't make it better. It's just that he was able to make it through Vol I and II without a cuss word, something I found very cool.Oh well, good album, i'd give it more stars if he took the word ""jazz"" out of it because there isn't much of it at all. Nice job Guru, just please don't think of bringing Kenny G aboard for the next Vol."

4,MR. SCARFACE IS BACK!,"And personally I am glad. I've waited 3 years for his return. I have been a fan of his since ""My Mind Playing Tricks On Me"" so I know his work very well. This new CD is bumpin. I have yet to hear it all but from what I have heard he hasn't lost his touch. The first track ""It Aint"" is vintage Face and the one that I'm feeling now is ""They Down With Us"" the sampled track from BDP is slamming. If you are a Face fan ..go cop this joint. To me it's not as good and ""The Untouchables"" but you wont be disappointed."
5,tight CD,"After I started to bumb The Last of a Dying Breed, I was already into the CD. The beats are off the hook. This is a must buy album and if you don't have it, you should get it. My favorite tracks are the single ""It Ain't (Part II), ""O.G. to me"" featuring Jayo, Daz, and Kurupt, and ""Get Out"" with Jay-Z."
4,a must have for a go go's,"Yes, this album picks up where ""A Go Go"" left off, but I give it higher marks for doing just a bit more with, what is arguably - less. Without the backing of MMW (previously on A Go Go), Scofield produces an album with a bit more energy and a whooooole lotta funk! Tracks 4 & 7 provide unique glimpses of a great new direction Sco has taken. The one minor drawback of this disk - and his outstanding tour in support of it - is some of the tunes/styles run a tad similar."
4,Weis and Hickman do it again,"As usual, Weis and Hickman have produced a great novel. The best thing about this one was the fact that it showed how thin the line between good and evil is. The book was well written and the story was very intriguing. Can't wait for the sequel."
1,Should include the REAL recipes for Cheesecake,"This book is sold largely on offering the Junior's Cheesecake recipe. I find it distasteful to find that they offer some cheesecake recipes, while keeping their own recipe secret. Poor form."
3,I purchased this at a teacher's request,"I purchased this to use at school, only to find it was for home use only. This is surprising since it is from Scholastic. It would be helpful it this were stated before purchase."
4,"Get a grip Amherst, MA","Just responding to the ridiculous comments made by the sheep from Amherst, MA. Badimo is an excellent track, which is somewhat outside the J.R. scope, but a real dark, progressive piece nonetheless. Stop following the herd, stop following the single releases, and open your mind to change and progression."
5,Chapter And Verse,"Having already downloaded an MP3 copy of Chapter and Verse by Uriah Heep, I knew what I was getting but wanted the full packaging and CD quality sound. What I received exceeded expectations, the packaging is superb and a detailed and comprehensive booklet with notes from surviving members, past and present. This brilliant boxed set was inexpensive and the time from ordering to arrival was about two weeks shorter than I expected. Thank You"
2,More Misses than Hits,"Any compilation of the ""greatest"" anything for any long period of time is fraught with potential problems. Granted that, the selections made are pleasant enough if one is trying to introduce Latin music to someone unfamiliar with it. To anyone even moderately familiar with the genre, this collection is a major disappointment. ""Granada"" as a love song? The performances mix great artists with some who do not do justice to some good accompaniment. The major flaw, however, is omitting the real greats, Pedro Vargas singing ""Mujer"" for example, and ignoring much that is Latin, ""Uno"" and ""El Dia Que Me Quieras"" tangos, ""Limena"" and other Peruvian valses. I would pass and look for my own favorites."
2,Most definitely NOT a good or comprehensive collection.,"If this compilation truly lived up to its title it would have included such legends as Jose Jose, Cheo Feliciano, Santos Colon, Los Tres Diamantes, Los Tres Reyes and Los Tres Caballeros among others. Another problem is that most of the versions included here are covers and not the originals. This is most definitely NOT the essence of Latin music."
4,If you are looking for barometric pressure - Great Tool,"The unit is very small which is great. I tracks barometric pressure, and temperature like a champ. As far as the wind meter, it always seems low. The altitude meter works fine except everytime you use it, you have to know set you starting elevation to set a baseline. Because there are only two buttons, the menu is much like a Casio wrist watch. This is kind of frustrating because unless you use the thing often, it is hard to set up for each use. Overall, I like the barometric pressure system. The wind speed deal bugs me. But, I guess knowing that it is reading low, atleast you can get a relative idea of what is going on. It probably is not worth the money unless you are a gadget guy or need it often."
3,"Sequel to the 'Mockumentary"" MEET THE RAISINS","If you enjoyed the original ""mockumentary,"" (The Califonia Raisins:) MEET THE RAISINS, then you'd probably enjoy this campy sequel. It's not as good or funny as the original; but it does feature a few inside jokes here and there (and great covers to original Motown and disco tunes from the 70's). I do recall that the original film was such a Hit, that it spun-off not just this sequel but a cartoon series, based off those 4-characters (AC,Bebop,Stretch ...?) from MEET THE RAISIN ... I think it was called: ""California Raisins""(1989)(TV)."
2,Kinda gross,"I didn't like this book that much. It is the literary equivalant to a snuff film. To judge from other comments on this board, it's not even that good of a snuff film. That said, it did hold my interest until the rather predictable end. For this alone I give it two stars."
5,A fantastic live disc,"""Live Aus Berlin"" features the German industrial/metal machine known as Ramstein at they're best: live. Widely known for they're pyrotechnic shows, the energy from the band and the crowd of screaming fans on this live album makes up for the lack of visuals. ""Spiel Mit Mir"", ""Sehnsucht"", ""Wilder Wein"", ""Du Hast"", ""Rammstein"", and ""Seeman"" are all brought to life live amazingly, but the standout track here is the mournful ""Engel"" in which the crowd sings along, and the emotion in lead singer Till Lindemann's voice must be heard to be believed. The thrashing drums and grinding guitar work has never sounded better, and all together ""Live Aus Berlin"" is one of the best live albums from a metal/industrial outfit. The DVD of the same title is also strongly recommended, just as long as your not afraid of fire or any of Rammstein's other infamous live shenanigans."
4,Live Aus Berlin (Limited Edition),"The Rammstein Live aus Berlin cd is taken from their concert at berlin on August 22,1998. This version contains three more songs than the regular cd. They are ""Klavier"", ""Tier"", and ""Herzeleid"". Both versions contain ""Wilder Wein"" which is not available on the other albums."
2,kills my back and shoulders,"We were given this carrier as a gift. My husband is 5 ft 10, and I am 5 ft 2. My husband wore this carrier on a two hour walk, and his back was in agony afterwards. I cannot wear this carrier for more than an hour, without having a sore back for the whole next day. Part of the problem is that the straps won't adjust to bring the baby higher. I see other moms with the Baby Bjorn, and their babies look so snug and comfortably high up on their chests, while my baby is swaying, and so low down that her legs are kicking against mine as I walk. My husband can usually fix anything. He is a great handyman, but we cannot get these straps to shorten. I will phone Maclaren and see what advice they can offer. If things change, I'll change my review."
2,"Loved this, but when it breaks... water boils at over 220","I use my beverage thermometer daily... actually 2X per day. I love my thermometer!I could live with the dial steaming up and having to wait till it 'un-steamed' to be able to read. I could live with the small dial. I could live with having to recalibrate every other week.What I could NOT live with was it deciding to no longer register temperatures acurately AT ALL. After 3 months, suddenly it now spikes and pegs the dial on LESS THAN BOILING WATER. no temperatures are accurate any longer.**TOSS**"
5,Modern Warfare,"Great Game. I traded this game in for a credit towards another game and now I'm missing it.I want to play the campaign again.This is one heck of a gameIntense battlesGreat graphicsNeat StorylineAwesome WeaponryThis is an ""own"" type game you want in your library with tremendous replay value.This is a AAA game, but for some reason the game has not garnered the acclaim it should."
3,Nothing to brag about,This game is an ok shooter but its just that there are so many first persons shooters the blow this game out of the water in terms of fun. The campaign is pretty long and repetitive also.
5,"Best in the series, thus far","A must read for vampire fans, and for the fans of those who slay them. ""Istvan"" is Susan Sizemore's best Hunter, so far. He definitely lived upto his reputation. I don't want to give away to much of the story, but I will say that you will see a couple of familiar face from the previous books. I hope to see more of Istvan in the future. My only complaint, the book was to short."
2,Disappointing,"It's modern and contemporary. Things you can do at home but I rarely use this book compared to the others in my floral design collection. For people who are serious about flowers, it's just a bunch of fluff."
5,Wooden Synagogues,"Ce livre est intéressant, bien fait, avec de très belles gravures. Beau travail de mémoire, utile si l'on souhaite effectuer des recherches approfondies dans ce domaine.Ravie de cet achat."
2,An exasperating attempt,"Edith Schaffer really does try. Perhaps that's the problem. I felt as if the book weren't just trying to convince me that Christianity is Jewish, but that I should be Christian. Maybe these feelings come from what I brought with me when I began this book, but Edith Schaffer approaches this topic from a /very/ Christian point of view, almost never trying to approach it from the side of a non-Christian. Though her point that Christianity comes from Judaism is well founded, she doesn't convince me that Christianity and Judaism didn't split ways centuries and millinea ago.Also, there are a number of fallacies in the book, such as the statement that Abraham only had one son or that Noah's ark was available to any who wanted on. Such incorrect statements, particularly on a topic she should know well, set her back on the credible front."
5,Lincoln The Martyr,"After the North's unprecedented depredations on southern civilians and their culture, they desperately needed a martyr and a cause. They got that in Lincoln and emancipation. DiLorenzo clearly makes the case that once again history has been written by the victors."
4,"I liked it, naturally, I'm a Libertarian","If you're looking for the unabridged story of Lincoln, this book is not for you. Rather, it helps sort out aspects of Lincoln's political history and the more common misconceptions. Hopefully, it will rouse an interest in liberty for those who read it. As our government continues to get bigger and spends more (regardless of political party affliation), it's interesting to get a sense of where it all started. DiLorenzo certainly makes a great Libertarian case against Lincoln and his Whig/Republican party. After reading the reviews, the book certainly has its share of critics; mainly, those who don't find Lincoln's agenda that egregious to begin with. I suppose it's a matter of taste."
4,"The Real Lincoln : A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda",It takes guts to write a book exposing unpopular truths. This is one of those books. It is well worth reading. Everyone should know that Lincoln was no hero; he was one of the worst people ever to obtain the office of the President of the United States.
1,A Prime candidate for pulping,"Another nasty little revisionist in the mould of David Irving. The only reason it gets 1 star, is that the combo box doesn't offer negative numbers.The left may attract the loonies, but the far right seems to have a magnetism for third-rate minds, (consider the rulers of the Third Reich). The states right Dilorenzo is so eager to defend were built round the assumption that it was OK for one human being to own another. Sorry, human rights come before states rights. This book is simply another in the long dreadful line, that says its OK to be horrible to people different from the writer, because, according to the writer, they aren't really people (cause they aren't like them).Frankly, don't buy this, and I'd rather hope my profile doesn't give me any similar recommendations in the future"
1,A new look that disappoints,This book is not worth reading. It distorts the historical record about the reasons for secession. It also misleads and distorts the facts about Lincoln's motivations. It calls him a racist when his actual views on race were very complex and more advanced than most of the people of his time. The book is worse than useless because of the many distortions and misrepresentations.
3,Forewarned.,"Before evaluating this, or any other history book,read ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"" by Loewen.Before accepting this book's point of view as fact,do the intellectually and morally honest work of consideringthe agenda, the scholarship, and the accuracy of any claims.I suspect that if you were to gather enough information onany topic, you could find a way to tell any kind of story-positive or negative- about anyone or anything. With thisbook, I suspect ""provocation"" and not scholarship is thereal objective.Occam's Razor applies here. Would you rather believe theelaborately constructed conspiracy theory, or the simpletruth?"
2,Revisionism !!!,"Lincoln among many others both of the north and south, thought that the impending war was going to be short. Certainly not the long bloody conflict that was the Civil War. One of the reasons that the war was so bloody was because the tools of warfare were far ahead of strategy and the means to care for and aid the wounded was still in the middle ages. If indeed slavery was going to end by its own accord, this must not have been known to the supporters of slavery, for why make an issue of wanting slavery to extend to new territories ???Jeff Davis said that he wish he could have exercised some the powers that Lincoln did, such as suspension of habeas corpus.The southern states were a bunch a selfish fiefdoms and that caused them the war. You bitter eager critics of Lincoln, he realized what was needed to win the conflict and he did what was necessary to win it."
1,"Its commentary, not history.","This book reads like its falls somewhere between the Dixiecrat pages of ""Southern Partisan"" magazine and the leftist historic revisionism of Pravda. Far from being an objective historian, Dilorenzo writes with a huge chip on his shoulder. Slogging through this nausiating diatribe, the reader begins to wonder just what personal slight a man who's been dead for over 130 years could have done to fill the author with such anger. DiLorenzo just can't seem to find anything good to say about Lincoln, or America for that matter. (He and Sean Penn should get together.) The book reads like another one of those consipracy theories. Every little problem we have today is all Lincoln's fault, or so DiLorenzo says, and according to the author, there is plenty of material to back this harebrained claim up. Unfortunatly most of the works he cites are from both far left and far right fringe writers, commentators, and revistionist historians. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out."
3,Kind of an insult to her subjects,"Wide-eyed, People magazine journalism from a silly, godless woman. Truthfully, there isn't a decent book out that examines nuns' place in America today; this comes somewhat closer, but in honesty Kaylin's book is a waste of time. Check out ""Lesbian Nuns: Breaking the Silence"", and Mary Gordon's piece in the December 2001 Atlantic."
4,An outsider's look at nuns.,"One of the things that I liked about Lucy Kaylin's look at this subject was how she was able to say that she thought that having grown up without religion, she was free of all preconceived notions about nuns. And then admits that she was in for a few surprises. The book is a bit uneven in spots, but tries to take a look at conservative nuns, radical nuns, and just about everything in between. Kaylin tries to show the great diversity of women who are striving to live spiritual lives. I found some of the stories more moving than others. And some of the women came across as more - I guess you could say more appealing than others. But, then, isn't this how it is with everyone you meet or read about? Some speak to you, and some just annoy you."
5,Perfect fit,We own 2 apartment buildings that have fans which require this motor. Have been unable to find them locally. The price is cheaper than the cost of repairing a motor and the fans were here in a matter of a couple days.
4,Birds of Chile,"Since I had traveled to Chile, I wanted a book to look up all the birds I saw there. The book arrived in good shape and I look forward to identifying birds I saw in Chile."
4,Started rattling after two years,"The apartment I moved into didn't have a ceiling fan so I bought the Aloha Breeze for the white noise and air flow when I slept. I ran it every night for two years before it started rattling. It doesn't have a high pitch whine like the other fans I tried to replace it with, but the fan isn't ultra quiet if that's what you're looking for. The middle speed was what I used.I would've given it five stars if I could have gotten to the bearings to grease them. From the two other tower fans I've looked at as replacements, they all have similar motor casing, so eventually you'll have to replace any tower fan when the lubrication is rubbed away. I ended up replacing it with the Honeywell HY-105; it's also got a ""sleep"" speed that's extremely quiet."
4,Good value for a good fan,"Reliable and functions. Much less expensive than ""ionic breeze"" or other yuppie products one might get at the S.I. Has three fan settings and is very quiet. Doesn't stir up dust and blow it around like a traditional fan does. Only draw back is that it does not have a filter."
1,BIGFOOT HOUSE PARTY,"""Among Us""is made by the Polonia brothers, Pennsylvania's answer to Ed Wood. The produce, write, direct and star in their own productions known for their sci-fi nature and bad props. This feature is a mocumentary of fictional Bigfoot movies. It is a clever idea that didn't live up to expectations.The film has the jerky movement of a handheld camera. The acting and sound track is on par with what one would expect from a mid level corporation production.No f-bombs, sex or nudity."
5,the photoshop book for digital photographers,"This has been the best book on ""How to do"" I have ever read. The instructions are so precise and to the point. His sense of humor is fun without getting in the way. I wish this guy would write books on everything else I want to learn about. Maybe he should be a consultant on how to do these types of books.The only small frustration is in the shift between Mac and PC. Some times this is confusing but I can still figure it out."
4,A Helping Hand,This is a handy guide to help you weave through the steep learning curve of Photoshop and it's techniques. If you do not have the luxury of the latest version of Photoshop Elements this is recommended reading. Newbie digital photographers who have previously invested in Photoshop hoping to achieve great results in photography can now do so following many easysteps that are laid out in various sections of the book. Complicated procedures simplified. What more could you ask for? It is recommended reading.
2,It's Not That Great,"This isn't the most horrible bike around but it's far from the best deal around.I had a hard time putting it together because the instruction manual is for many bikes by the same manufacturer and the directions aren't very clear.Now that it's together it's a nice looking bike but it isn't very sturdy. The kick stand seems like it will not take much use at all, and the frame seems flimsy.I usually give pretty positive reviews but there isn't a lot of good that I can say about this one."
4,Support Good Software for Mac OS X,"Route 66 is not the best software of it's kind but it is the best for Mac OS X. Prior to this I used DeLorme Street Atlas USA which was a better product but not updated for OS X.Route 66 has a confusing interface and forces you to do trip routing their way instead of doing it your way. However once you learn their way the software becomes quite usable. The routing interface needs work.The aquafied buttons, while very pretty, aren't very intuitive.The Appearance and quality of the maps are excellent.The speed of the program while not optimal, is usable(15"" PB 1.5Ghz, 1GB RAM).I have high hopes for this software. Hopefully the developer will realize that the Mac market is starving for this kind of thing and Apple's notebook sales are going to continue to create more demand."
4,Its not great but not bad.....,"Like many of the other reviews I found the software to run a little slow. I haven't had any problems with crashes. Works with my Garmin GPS. User interface takes a little getting used to. It is a good start but updates are needed. I am also just glad to have a product for the MAC, so I will support Route 66 for that. Hopefully we will see continued improvement."
3,Printing problems!,"I must concur with the previous review. The mapping software is really quite good and shows much promise; but there is a major bug in the software. It will *not* print directions - only an overview map of your trip! Very odd. I thought this might be a problem unique to my G4 Powerbook, but I encountered the exact same problem on a desktop and another more up to date Powerbook.Again, to echo the other reviewer: Route 66 software is on the right track, but this piece of software is *certainly* not past a beta testing stage and shouldn't be offered as a fully functioning, full-priced product.If and when they iron out the kinks, they'll be cooking with gas."
3,America - The Story of Us,"A story nicely told - but watch the facts. In particular, the USA size that is continually referenced is ""9 million square MILES"" when in fact the USA is a bit larger than ""9 million square KILOMETERS."" OOPS!"
1,Havent received the DVD yetttttttt,Please Sir or MadamCan you check this item I ordered a few weeks ago.As I havent received it yet!!!Thanks
4,Story of America,"Have not watched all the DVDs yet. Those that I have seen are very good and informative. If I would have known that Obama did the introduction, I would not have purchased them. I think an American should do the introduction. If anybody reads this, I hope you don't buy because a citizen of Kenya telling me what a good country America is just doesn't seem right. As I said, the presentation is very good."
3,Watched it on cable and like it,"I like watching this at my own time and pace, especially during all the reruns on TV. Very interesting historical information"
2,Beware of revisionist history,"Be warned: You'll need a firmly established and unbiased view of American history from primary sources or more authoritative scholars if you want a true version of American history, especially if you're homeschooling. Be prepared to delve further and have deeper discussions if watching with children (not recommended for the preteen set, with references to alternative lifestyles and prostitution)."
3,"Could I Have More Credibility, Please?","I love the History channel. It's full of interesting shows. However, this series, while it is still fascinating to a point, does not have the sources from historians and professors like I was hoping. They include thoughts from such people as Martha Stewart and Sean Combs. To be honest, these people are entertainers and, in my humble opinion, do not know history enough to talk about it. Other than that, I would say this show is alright."
3,Not to shabby,"First off I will say I did enjoy this series a great deal. I will simply my views to a list of Pros and ConsPROS: Kept Interest, Good reanactment scenes and animations, good overview of our historyCONS: Not always the best actors (Many dont look anything remotely like the realy people) also some figures portrayed slighty wrong. And lastly some people on this show that were interviewed propbably had somone write down there lines,"
4,correction,"By mistake , there was a low review of stars on my last review, and is supposed to have more stars, my apologies, I recommend this documentary."
5,FANTASTIC,"History brought to life, and much easier to understand. The only history lesson I haven't slept through!"
2,Margaret Cho?,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed with this documentary. It could be that the scope of the project was just too much to do it justice, but several major parts of the ""story of us"" were missing including the Constitutional Convention, the War of 1812, and the First World War just to name a few.I also thought that the selection of commentators was extremely poor. Seriously, why was Margaret Cho, who is of Korean decent, chosen to speak about the immigrant Chinese laborers who worked on the trans-continental railroad? It's almost as if she was selected because she ""looked"" Chinese and therefore credible."
4,"Not Dylan, so what?","Imperforate Himens misses it altogether. This guy is the most heartfelt yet talented singer/songwriter I have ever seen. His genuine emotions pour through the music, and perhaps someone who would rather pontificate on what boots of spanish leather feels like, may have a hard time examining their own deep insecurities. Mr. Kinney draws from a profound depth of personal experiences, that are apparent, particularly live. Nasal... Give me a break! Townes Van Zandt and Bob Dylan are accused of the same thing. I seldom write these, because somebody more literate, or worse, illiterate, has already said it all, but I can't let some hackneyed critic, who didn't listen to it... ahh, what's the use?Suffice to say, if you listen to him, AND if you like his voice, you will like this album. I have never missed the band when he plays solo live. I gave it a four because of the ""jammier"" guitars rock songs, which are fun, but stand askew from the other songs."
5,Perfect-sized Microwave,"I recently ordered the larger size ( 2.2 cubic) of this family of Panasonic microwaves for our kitchen and loved it so much that I ordered the smaller size for family room; what a surprise that it is 1300 watts! It serves the family nicely for heating/reheating items for entertaining. I love the design and material of this oven and recommend it to anyone looking for the best design, function and convenience of a microwave oven."
1,not so good,"This book made me think about finishing the series or not.This was kind of an annoying book. The whole thing was about 3 little girls who kept messing everything up. A little dwarf, elf and human. All they did was spy on meetings and then try to take matters into their own hands only to make it worse. More wasted pages and time on Alfred too. (They could have made this series about 5 books instead of 7 if they took out this useless bumbling fool, and the hundred's of pages dedicated to him.) I won't tell you the ending, but it was bad.Next book, back to Arianus. Another book full or Morons...I mean Dwarves/Gegs."
3,"Liked the book, hated the Kindle edition","Can't complain about the story. The Kindle edition was terrible, though, not worth $8. Full of typos and strange symbols. Please clean this up."
3,Hmmm... I don't know...,"I would say that if you like Harry Gregson-Williams buy this. The music is definately great especially in Evacuating London and The Battle. In the Blitz it seems a bit contrived from John Williams. Some of th music is stunning but I'm disapponted they cut SO MUCH music from the movie. They put in those pop songs they played in the credits than noone cares about. They're starting to do that now and it bothers me that that space coud've been used to put more of the score. The pop songs are RUBBISH anyway.Don't waste your money on this cd, the trailer music may sound appealing but there are really only a couple of tracks worth the money, ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!"
5,Lovely...,"I'm a very positive person, and I usually only take the trouble to review things that I really like. I really liked this soundtrack. Now that I have stated the obvious, let me ask: Who in God's green earth is Harry Gregson-Williams??? Okay, I asked. *Ahem.* When I first watched the movie, I was struck several times by the beauty of the music. Especially during the Lucy/Tumnus lullaby scene. That track alone makes the CD worth buying, but the rest of the music certainly is not disappointing. ""Evacuating London,"" surprisingly enough, is almost astonishingly beautiful, even with such an unpromising title.The vocal selections at the end of the CD are certainly worth listening to, although I must admit to skipping directly to track five, ""A Narnia Lullaby,"" every time I insert my disc. What can I say? I love flutes! A quick P.S. I had no trouble converting my CD into MP3 format. I am, in fact, listening to it as I type."
3,Moderately Pleased,I got this package on Ebay for a killer deal and I am glad I did not pay the full price for it.The strength of the package is that it allows you to view your progress and gives your instructor some degree of control. The weakness is that the program is very confusing to work with and not user friendly.On the menu you have to choose from a drop down list of activities. The program gives you NO idea of where to start. Which activities should I do first?The book cancels out some of the confusion. However....the book should have been more practical and more easier to read...too rigid as one person said.I would not suggest this for the absolute beginner.
2,Just not loving them,"They warp when they get hot.... they seem to ""stain"" to the outline of whatever is baked on them. Scuff easily. I expected better. :("
3,Disappointed,Whilst the musical content can't be surpassed the audio quality sucks.The CD I acquired was released on Black Rose records and it was lifted from vinyl which had seen better days.Harsh top end that reminded me why many crossed to CD.Unless they re-release with material from the master tapes avoid like the plague.
1,"POOR QUALITY, POOR AND CONFUSING PERFORMANCE","I can never understand why electronics manufacturers have to put a bunch of unnecessary ""features"" into whatever they make. I wanted a simple digital scale to measure road maps, but after wading through the confusing instructions, punching button after button to set up time zones and such, I finally got to the map measurer part. It required so many mathematical calculations to make the conversion to the proper scale that my head was spinning - and then when I used it on a local map where I knew the actual distances, it was way off. On top of that, the last digit on the LED screen would only light up partway. Poor quality, very difficult to understand and operate - I sent it back for a refund."
5,Thumbs up for Brown's Literary Conservatory & reading list!,"My favorite part of this book is the author's suggested path of study in her Literary Conservatory chapter, which presents a four-year writer's curriculum (nothing like this was offered at any university at the time this book was published in the mid-1980's). To help writers study their craft, accompanying the writer's curriculum is a huge suggested reading list, meant to be read in order (from the oldest works of antiquity to newer works up until about 1980). I'd love to see the author expand on her idea of the Literary Conservatory and write a sequel to this book. It'd make a great independent study option for those who are unable to enroll in a formal college literary writing program, but who would still like to pursue a formal course of study designed just for hopeful would-be authors."
3,Enjoyed it,"As usual, enjoyable writing from this tireless author. Good book for ingenue as well as mature reader/writer."
5,Must Be Doing Something Right,"When half of your reviews are five stars, deeming it wonderful spirited music, and the other half dismiss it as dismal dreck you know you gotta be doing something right. I LOVE being able to spin a Van Morrison tune at the small country station I work at. It's fun to follow up a Jerry Lee tune with, or fun just about anytime really. Is this some of Van's worst? No way, Pedro."
2,No Show Fo' Van Mo,"This is a fun album and the songs Van chose are rich with heart. My roommate and I were jamming to ""Pedro"" and ""Cadillac"" last night. However, the real quality of the album is questionable. Linda Gail's vocals, though enjoyable, aren't assertive enough to keep up with Van's and The Pokers sound cheeesy. Van himself gives an unremarkable performance. Usually Van Mo's covers are as touching as the origials. ""Jesse James"" and ""Irene"" off SKIFFLE were enough to make me ball. The only touching moment on this album that I've found in my few short days of listening is where Van says ""make up your G.D. mind"" on ""Pedro"". It sounds like he really meant it. I think the strength of the songs are the only thing that keeps this boat afloat, cause it isn't the performances. If you dig cheeky C&W, go for it."
2,No Show Fo' Van Mo,"I'm not sure what to make of Van Mo's latest. It's a lot of fun and all the songs he chose great. My roomate and I were jamming to ""No Way Pedro"" and ""Cadillac"" last night. However, the real quality of the alblum is questionable. Linda Gail's vocals aren't assertive enough to keep up with Van's and The Pokers sound cheeeesy. Are they the same guys that did the intro music for 3rd Rock from The Sun? Van himself doesn't give a notable performance. Usually Van's covers are capable of being as touching as the original. ""Jesse James"" and ""Irene"" on SKIFFLE were enough to make me ball. I think the songs are the only thing that keeps this boat afloat, 'cause it ain't the performances. If you dig cheeky C&W, go for it."
2,Definitely small,"I read another reviewer's comment that these run small. I thought they might be skinny-small, but they are short-small. Size small is for 6-8 but seems like it should be for sizes 4-6, if that. I am disappointed that I ordered these online, since they just don't seem worth the money, nor worth the extra money it would cost to exchange them."
5,Beyond words,"Attempts to define ""beauty"", invariably seem inadequate, but then, thank God, we have the recorded music of artists like Bill Evans to allow us to experience it. I know fans have their trio favorites with Evans like Scott LaFaro, Paul Motian, Eddie Gomez and Marty Morrell, etc., but the work on bass and drums by Marc Johnson and Joe LaBarbera on this collection enable this Bill Evans Trio to achieve a level of artisty that simply just takes your breath away. Treat yourself to something wonderful."
1,Don't Bother,Don't bother buying a nylon string guitar especially this one. Go straight to steel strings. This guitar continues to go out tune. And you spend too much of your practice time tuning it up. My daughter has a new guitar with steel strings. Sounds heavenly. Wasted $70 on this Lauren guitar.
3,"C'mon, SNL! There's better stuff out there!","Though Tracy Morgan had his moments, in his guise of perennial doofus ""Brian Fellows"" and occasional bits as ""Al Sharpton,"" the second-tier SNL didn't deserve a ""best of"" compilation. In the bits gathered here, some of the best laughs come from the uncredited guest stars (The Rock, Matt Damon, and a hilarious performance from Vince Vaughn as a ""white chocolate"" pimp). Many of Morgan's better routines are noticebly absent from this collection and that leaves the viewer longing for more...especially from other cast members, as well as guest hosts.A compilation of the best of John Goodman would be an automatic seller!Even current cast members Horatio Sanz and Maya Rudolph deserve some attention."
3,disappointment,"I really like the comics, but as I had already read all his online comics 2 times(from the very beginning up to now) I wasn't going to read the comics again. I bought this book to support him and to read some background for the comic. Boy was I wrong. There is NO text in the book. and it looks like it was made in a few minutes.If you want to read a great comic for the first time, buy this book, if you have already read it online, don't expect anything from this book."
5,sinfest is the best,"I've been reading the sinfest webcomic for a little over 2 years now and I've been nothing but impressed by Tatsuya's wit and talent as a cartoonist/rebel. The irreverent style of sinfest will challenge your convictions and really make you think, but one of sinfests best qualities is its honesty. I can't reccomend this book enough, read the comic the syndicates are too scared to carry! It'll probably be the only time you see God taunt the devil with puppet ;)It's great to finally have a text copy of Sinfest, I hope he will release the the rest of the collection sometime soon."
5,Sinfest is the best,"I've been reading sinfest for close to two years now and I'm really excited that I can finally own my own copy of the fantastic first year. I hope Tatsuya will come out with the rest of his comics in paper form, I will gladly pay for them!May the resistance live on!"
4,A solid southwestern mystery that kept me guessing,"Zia Summer started off with a classic gruesome murder, and kept the reader guessing the whole time on who was behind it right alongside the main character, Sonny Baca.Though the book had a few slow points from time to time, I always looked forward to the next chapter.The story is also peppered with an unusual and highly identifiable cast of characters; each one to the readers liking.My only complaints were to make the book more 'authentic' the author sprinkled the dialouge with Spanish slang that may confuse readers on what the characters are talking about.Also the end was a bit anti-climatic, but all around very good."
1,You don't even get what you pay for,"I got this on Friday special from Amazon for $25 shipped, thinking how much I would save in Mystic tanning sessions by doing this myself at home. I am not impressed-- I acknowledge my unit may have been defective, but I'm not taking the chance and I'm returning it to Amazon for a refund.In short, it did not work well at all. The plug on the recharging unit got too hot to the touch after charging for a little while. The reservoir was very difficult to remove and it did not spray very strong. Worst of all, it did a poor job on me-- although I tried to coat myself evenly, I am only tan in places here and there. I am tannest on spots on both of my hands, which is very noticeable and embarrassing. In addition, the spray gun seemed to be a bit leaky- yuck.So, the experiment did not go well and it's back to Mystic for me. This is a poor product and based on its performance, I would say that if you paid a penny for it, it would be one cent too much."
4,"""Marlene Dietrich Live in London""","A budget-priced version of her London performance. Delightful.1. A lilting,waltzing version of ""La Vie en Rose.""2. ""Johnny,"" performed with a tango beat, would be hot for airplay even today (""Be here at three a.m. and make love to me!"").3. Probably her best version of ""Lili Marlene.""4. A jazzy version of ""Honeysuckle Rose."" Almost like ""Fever.""5. A hilarious, cabaret-flavored version of ""Lola.""My favorite Dietrich c.d."
1,This isn't a story....,"...it's a glimpse of time. Just Josie Matthews ""teaching"" her neighbor and friend Brett Callahan how to entice another woman to marry him. Did I believe anyone could be so dense? No.Lack of communication between the two main characters kept the story going until the end. I felt that was the only reason the author could make this situation almost two hundred pages. There are so many other great romances that are out there...don't waste your time or money on this book."
5,Makes an excellent gift,I saw this Rainbow Maker at a retreat and decided to order it for my spouse for Valentines Day. She loved it. Actually ordered one for myself as well. I love the light effects it makes as it rotates!
4,Great Christmas present,"I was looking for a Christmas present for my Mom who is 94. She has had prisms in her windows in the past, this seemed like and fun thing for her, and it is . She is really enjoying watching the rainbows, when the sun shines!"
4,Very pretty,"I purchased 3 different types of Rainbow Makers as Christmas gifts this year. I gave the heart-shaped one to my mom. It makes really pretty rainbows as expected, however I deducted one star because I think the heart shaped crystal results in fewer rainbows than the normal octagonal shape. But that doesn't mean it won't produce a beautiful display of color for hours in a sunny room! This would make a wonderful Valentine's Day or Mother's Day gift, too!"
1,I like Porcupine Tree but this was AWFUL!,"I have almost all of Porcupine Tree's CDs and have seen them live, but this is awful. It is just a random collection of noise and is probably the worst CD out of over 1000 progressive CDs I own. Save your money -- don't buy it!"
5,Great Throwback,I bought this movie for my 3 year old son for Christmas. I used to watch it when I was a kid and loved it. I can't wait for him to enjoy it as much as I did. It's such a great kids show!
1,great show horrid product,"Just sad that the quality of this product stinks. The set contains 4 discs. Two of my discs will not play. Hopefully the replacement will be better. I notice most people have given this a 5 star review, leaving me wondering if the people reviewing are rating the show itself or the disc set."
3,"not as good as the second, more recent Clone Wars series","After watching some of the newer Clone Wars series (the one that started in 2008), I was a bit disapointed in this earlier version of the series. The biggest thing that I don't like about this 1st clone wars series is the cheap, poor-graphics animation used. Many of the characters looked NOTHING like they do in the movies- since when does Anakin have a rectangle for a head? The graphics quality of the light sabers is pretty poor also. I also have to agree with some of the people hear who've mentioned how everyone's powers are widely exagerated, but that does make it kinda funny.For a much better depiction of what goes on in the Clone Wars-era, I highly recommend checking out the newer Clone Wars series, which goes into much more depth of what happens in that time period, as well as displaying MUCH better graphics & animation."
4,Clone Wars Vol. 2,Clone Wars Vol. 2 is an excellent tie in to Episode 2 and 3 of Star Wars. I liked it better than Vol. 1 as Vol 1 seemed to be mostly fights and other violence and less emphasis on story line. Vol. 2 makes up for the short comings of Vol. 1. The action sequences were excellent and colorful. The only shortcoming that I found was that it was animated instead of real life.
3,Review,"Seems a bit exagerrated: yoda can all of a sudden push loads of enormous ships together, mace windu controls a droid fighter by pulling its wires, and one clone trooper can defeat thousands of battle droids, not to mention the fact that it is completely diffrent from the more mature Labyrinth of evil novel. Otherwise, some nice, brainless fun."
2,jock porn; how original,"git this one free at someone's garage sale, actually. thought it would be more psorty, not so spotty. on facts. i played lots of sports for years. there weren't near as manyerection action going on. if only. this sort of stuff is silly. but hot, for a read."
5,Chrome is good,Even better than the original which I am replacing due to lost parts during a bathroom renovation. Looks good and a perfect fit on a 40 year old faucet.
3,So much potential- not reached,"I picked this dvd up thinking it would teach me common signs in a classroom, instead it just shows you what they say are common songs in the classroom. When I realized that I thought ok maybe this will be helpful. If you watch the version with the children they just sign and sing the song with no explanation at, it doesn't even slow down the song to sign it for beginners. If you watch the adult version, she shows you the signs she will be using in the beginning and then signs the song. Again with no explanation for the signs and it doesn't break down the song or slow it down at all. My daughter also had no interest in this dvd at all. This dvd had great potential but just doesn't deliver. I really can't understand why this is award winning.If you want a good signing series look at signing time. Everything is broken down into smaller parts, there is repetition, and my daughter is captivated by it."
4,Good Resource,Good book for discovering the science of ayurveda. Organized for easy access for looking up decent ailments and the ayurvedic remedies.
3,Missing some important details to make this book useful,"after thourghly reading this book, I find Author assumes you have complete knoweldge of Ayurvedic Herbs, Meidcine and mixes. I think a simple list of all Ayurvedic medicine need for household is required but missing in this book, which fails to make this book useful. You simply cant ""run and grab"" a herb whenenver you need."
1,disappointing,"The book is thought provoking, but there are no inspired solutions here. Interesting theories, but Halberstam's application's are often hypocritical, short-sighted and self-serving rather than based on moral imperatives."
3,A true Final Fantasy fan will love this.,"Any Final Fantasy fan will love this. But for TRUE anime fans, this title falls short. I expected something that would resemble the games, like an narrative intro to the story and a lot more character interaction, traveling, and MAGIC."
2,I bought it only because it was two fifty.,Where should I start? This anime was pretty low quality. The animation was bad the story was lacking and the action was pretty weak. The only reason I don't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse but not much. In other words DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO unless you can get it for two fifty at Babbages like I did.
2,I wish I could give it 2 and a half stars!!!,"I consider this movie average. It had poor animation, Terrible voice acting, and a somewhat corny plot. Now your probably wondering what exactly it good about this movie. And the fact is: it's actually quite entertaining. What I hate most about this movie is, it stops right in the middle of the story. In order to see the rest, you must rent, or buy the second one. Another thing I hated, was it just seemed so kiddy-like. It was barely a step up from pokemon. It had no blood, gore, nudity, or swearing. I'm sorry, but these things are pretty much mandatory in a good anime film. It was also very un-emotianal, and unrealistic, like a kiddie cartoon-show.Here's the bottom line: It is great for ""Pokemon"", ""Dragon Ball Z"", and ""Sailor Moon"" fans, but not much for those hardcore anime fans who like: ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Macross Plus"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Akira"", etc."
1,Final Fantasy,"This animated action film has much, much more comedy in it than it does any kind of fantasy/science fiction. The comedy drenches this movie, and although it has much more to do with Final Fantasy than it's competitor (Spirits Within), it's a comedy/action film that isn't meant to be taken seriously. If you're looking for a good action film, I would recommend the Spirits Within. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy games and you don't mind comedy, this is the movie for you."
5,Soooooo...,"This was a gift. And it was loved. So should you or the recipient love cats... then this will be a fantastic gift. But, and this has happened before with other Monopoly sets. You may recieve 2 of a specific play piece. Instead of 6 different play pieces. My sister recieved 2 pewter birds instead of a bird and a milk carton. So beware. Other then that, it is basically monopoly."
4,good reference,"if you are looking for basic info on what to grow and how to use it, this is a good source. has lots of various topics that will entertain and get you think. Now get your cauldron ready..."
3,Good But Not The Best Dive Watch,"If you don't wear this watch for a couple of days, you will have to reset it before use. I have a watch for daily use, so this happens opten. I liked the old battery operated Seiko Dive watch I had for 17 years better."
1,Lousy Timepiece,"Have used this watch while SCUBA diving and it performed fine in keeping the minutes underwater. The one way rotating bezel is a nice safety feature that will not allow you to subtract time from your dive if accidently bumped. It is a heavy well built watch. It feels like a quality watch on your arm. However don't plan on this being your daily wear watch. It keeps time lousy. It looses nearly 15 minutes a month if you don't reset it. This wouldn't be so bad if the watch was easy to set but you pull out the knob and there are three increments to set the time, date, and day and it is very hard to get it just right. I dreaded setting this watch. Very disappointed in this watch from such a well respected brand name."
5,So great I purchased two!,"I purchased this watch for my Son and Husband for Christmas. They both love the watch! They say it is very comfortable to wear, and easy to read. They love the illuminated dial, and can't wait to go diving with it! My Son collects watches, so he is very picky. He wanted this watch, so that says a lot. The watches were purchased separately, but they both arrived in a very timely manner. I would Highly recommend this seller and product."
3,Twice As Much Though?,"Nice but I mean it's just another basic non-hacking, non-windable Seiko Caliber 7s26 21-jewel movement in the same type of diver case as others like the SKX009, SKX007, SKX031, SKX013, orange ""Monster"" series etc. So why does it cost twice as much for?"
2,Wanted to like it but runs way too fast.,"I really wanted to like this watch. My father has one that he has had for 35 years and 3 tours in Vietnam. So my expectations were for a simple but quality item. Unfortunately it runs fast, real fast. It gains about 10 minutes ever five days.It is also pretty heavy, if it kept time I could put up with it but since it's fast, no dice."
1,Don't be fooled ... Don't buy this watch,"I have had this watch for approx. 45 days now. It is a beauty and appears to be well made ... like you expect from Seiko. BUT, it doesn't keep accurate time. The watch GAINS 2-3 minutes PER DAY. What a shame for a timepiece at this price. You can get dive watches for half the price that do keep accurate time. Since I am past the 30-day return period, Amazon will not take it back. Seiko will give me an ""estimate to fix"" after I mail it to New Jersey! I'd suggest that you look elsewhere for a good dive watch. Not sure about all the good reviews here (I trusted them) ... maybe I just got a lemon ... will you get one too?"
3,"Good Looks, not very accurate","I bought this one after a good experience with my Seiko Kinetic 200m watch. Returned it b/c it ran 3 minutes fast after 2 weeks of use (it was either on my wrist or on a winder the entire time). IMHO, this makes it a cute toy for the wrist, not an accurate timepiece. Kinetic is such a better movement - why doesn't Seiko make a Kinetic Diver's that looks like this ?Pros --------Rugged Look and FeelBright markersClassic stylingComfortable bandCons --------Accuracy.Made in Malaysia/Malaysia movement (listed on both face and back) :("
3,"""Amara"" is an alternate title for ""To Wake the Dead""","This is the British edition of ""To Wake the Dead"".It's about the resurrection of an Egyptian mummy named Amara.Richard Laymon is one of my favorite authors. I've read dozens of his books and liked every one.(Be careful that you don't accidental buy one of Laymon's fastbacks. Each of those contains just one short story. ""The Hearse"" is an example.)"
4,A good book for a stormy night,"I enjoyed this book mainly because it gives you the mystery of ghosts and hauntings. Some of them were intersting, others were boring but mostly they were entertaining. Some of them even creeped me out a bit."
3,Not Really Scary,"Some of the stories in the book were good and kept me thinking, but however it seemed that all the stories ended with, 'so and so no longer exists though.' Like all the haunted houses were no more so I felt that it gave off the impression that it was less true. Besides, what's better than a haunted place that is still around?! Also, I did in-depth research on several of the stories, to see if they were true, and I found either no such thing, or completely different stories. I live in Nebraska so I researched all the Nebraska stories and found only one to have been recorded as a real event. I guess I like ghost stories with proof."
1,Providing only PCM (stereo) output,"I am breaking my head on how to get Dolby/DTS/5.1 output from this module. Looks like we can not. It just converts the analog stereo to digital stereo. I tried all the settings in my onkyo reciever including direct channel. But, when i tried the test sounds (from the sound blaster control software), only the front left and right speakers play. The rest remains mute. You get the output when you enable the ""Digital output only"" from the sound control panel. But, the output is just PCM."
1,Items missing that used to be included.,"When I bought this module I first did research on the web. This module used to come with two cables to hook up to the Spdif on the mother board. I think the people that cannot get it to work, like me have no connection to the Spdif on the mother board. I was expecting the cables to be included, without them I get no light in the Toslink cable, or any sound when I tried a digital cable. I guess I will have to spend extra for a cable to hook my sound card to the mother board Spdif, if I want sound from this module.In the mean time I am very disappointed with Creative."
3,Not for optical S/PDIF !!!!,This product may be great.. but it does not connect to optical S/PDIF connections. So for instance it will do absolutely nothing for the Creative X-Fi extreme audio notebook..
4,Not the best one again .,"Definitely better than "" Dream "". But again it is not a real Kitaro . So sad ...At list I felt few of the tracks ... but it still reminds me his move to "" elevator "" music direction after he left Japan . He just had to stay the same : one of the most talanted musisions in the world ."
3,Scratched,"This item was ordered for a birthday gift and half of the discs were scratched and needed to be sent back. The person who received the discs for a gift enjoyed what she could watch of them, however."
5,A necessary read!,"I loved this book! I'm not a huge tennis fan so as I began reading, I was shocked at how quickly this story pulled me in and kept me fascinated. It's about so much more than tennis. The personalities and motivations of Billie Jean and Bobby were so thoroughly explored that as this spectacle of a match was becoming imminent, I could feel the pressure and the tension that must have been felt not only by them, but by many women and men in the 1970s as gender lines were being tested. This book did a great job of framing the importance of that one event, as circus-like as it was. Billie Jean and Bobby brought discussions of gender roles into people's living rooms that day and the consequences have paved the way for women and for the athletes we cheer on today. ""A Necessary Spectacle"" gave me new insight. Excellent!"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was looking for oil's for Aromatherapy. The smells this kit comes with are not for Aromatherapy. The oil samples are Eucalyptus, Peppermint (not good smells to use for your house), Tea Tree ( smells ""icky""), sweet orange, lavender, and rosemary (they smell OK)."
2,A trip into pure fantasy,"The readers' reviews of this sorry book astound me. This is a preposterous story. Imagine a fourteen year old being an important cog in a gang of coast to coast thieves,drinking doubles of whisky in smart hotels while constantly ""slammim"" heroin and popping every pill imaginable This is simply another instance of exploiting drug use as a basis for a silly novel. Anyone who goes for this useless drivel has very little experience of the drug scene. It's neither romantic or glamorous nor peopled by clever subversive people.Iknow whereof I speak,having paid my dues (a total of five years' jailtime) And while I have known a number of junkies' I can't recall any who fit these characters, exotic losers."
5,bought for someone as a gift,The recipent of this gift says it is one of the best books they have read. It arrived on time and in good condition.
4,Funniest thing I ever saw!,"Maybe it wasn't supposed to , but this A&E version of the classic novel had me rolling in the aisles. Although I considered The Lady Blakeney an only mediocre choice, The Sir Percy was absolutely hilarious, and was obviously having ""the time of his life"". When you see an actor doing that, it's bound to make the whole thing better. Ok, so it's not really the Scrlet Pimpernel, but who cares? It has it's own charm. A fresh, clean, funny and endearing choice."
4,Excellent Ironing Board,"This is an excellent ironing board. It is heavy and will last years and years. That may be its drawback, this one has no wheels and so is a little heavy to move around. The quality for the price was also excellent."
4,Rowenta ironing board,I found this ironing board to be sturdy and strong. It was also comfortable to use.
5,Simple and works well,When it arrived I was looking for some directions. You do not need any - just twist to the time and tap the top. That's it. Nice design and works fine.
2,Rather pointless,"I wanted to like this book, really I did. Big props to McFarland for even comissioning a second study of the slasher genre after their good, if distressingly slim, Going to Pieces. The problem here is the lack of a critical commentary. After a brief overview of slasher film history and conventions, the majority of the book consists of long, boring plot synopses (spoilers and twist endings included) followed by one or two lines of lame ""production notes"" and the author's overall opinion of the film's worth. For $65, I was hoping for much more than rote recitation of slasher film plots. Where are the intriguing behind-the-scenes stories from Adam Rockoff's ""Going to Pieces""? Where is the kind of excellent, in-depth analysis found in another McFarland book, John Kenneth Muir's eminently worthwhile ""Horror Films of the 1970s""? Pretty much a washout, I'm granting an extra star for good intentions. The slasher genre still yearns for a comprehensive study...let this be the clarion call!"
3,Informative and easy to read,"My daughter is six months old. I enjoy reading the book esp. the part in dialect, effect of TV, how to choose childcare. Most part of the book can be shorter. My husband got the same feeling."
1,Poor literaure,"This story is a boring tale of everyday Cuba. I could not find anything intereing in it. The only good thing is the title, because it describes exactly what it this book about: nothing (= nada). I have read other books that also talks about Cuban everyday life with a much better literary quality. I would not recommend it."
4,Great Bucket,"Fantastic portable bucket, I use this as a bag to carry other toys. The clear side panels and colours make this visually appealing too."
2,"I may have gotten the wrong cable, but am not sure and did not pursue it.","I may have gotten the wrong cable, but am not sure and did not pursue it with the vendor. Cable came on time. When plugged between my new desktop and older monitor, the new computer did not recognize the monitor. I don't know enough about the interface to know why but it worked with an adapter and a HDMI-HDMI cable."
4,monitor meets PS3,I've been using this cable for about 4 months now. It works excellent with my monitor viewsonic Q20 and my PS3. The system picks up the connection instantly and it works up to 1080p (though my monitor is 1680 x 1050 so I don't know how that works).A warning and It may not concern the actual cable but for those of you who are looking to connect your ps3 to your monitor (specifically the Q20) in analog mode my monitor has been showing everything but in a bluish hue.In digital mode (PS3 mode) works perfectly fine. Though I don't know the root cause of the problem it began around the time I connected my ps3 to the monitor. Just a heads up
3,"Some humour, much pretentiousness","If you have ever wanted to read about a female James Bond, with sexual prowess and flaire, here she is! Only she borders on a nausiating sweetness (perfect body, perfect I.Q., perfect lovers, perfect cook, perfect pitch, perfect address, etc.) But perhaps you will not mind her diatribes on her ""perfect"" morality. Still, worth a trip to the library for the humour."
2,Mine fits poorly,"It does keep your keyboard cleaner and the interference with typing isn't too bad. Unfortunately it is folded in the package and after more than a year mine hasn't flattened out completely. Typing over the fold (which lands over the cluster of keys to the right of the main keyboard) is annoying and since it doesn't sit flat on the keyboard there, it is much harder to read the key legends. It also tends to ride up around the edges.I called and wrote to the vendor and they basically said ""gee, too bad."""
3,IT'S FOR MY DOG,"I can't tell you much about it. I give it to my miniature Pinscher/Pomeranian cross because the salmon oil capsules I give my other dogs are too big for him. Together with flax oil, it gives him glossy hair and healthy skin."
2,You have to DOWNLOAD the CD-ROM (207 MB),"The current edition of this book does NOT contain a physical CD-ROM. Instead, Prentice Hall has a link on their website that allows you to download the CD-ROM contents as a single ZIP file. That's a 207 MB ZIP file, folks. They've made no provisions for partial downloads...This must be Prentice Hall's idea of a good way to increase the profit margin on their books. Recently, I've run across a couple other titles from PH-PTR where the CD-ROM mentioned in the preface is no longer included. In some cases, they haven't made the contents available on the web -- or even bothered to tell the book's author that they're dropping the media from the package."
2,Dim and inexpensive,"I bought two dozen of these for some atmospheric gaming sessions. Honestly, they are very dim and I had a couple DOAs out of the lot. Still, they are inexpensive, so that kinda makes it ok."
1,Worst product,The worst thing I bought from amazon. The thing i received looks totally different from the picture. The color was dark brown and no fragrance at all. I have to throw them away. Not worth to return.
1,Got weird.,"The first 3 books were okay, but this one just got bizarre. It seemed like she was making things up as she went, and disregarding her own universe's rules. And the characters became ridiculous, and totally out of character with themselves."
2,I can't cry hard enough is the reason for buying this,"I bought this for the song ""I can't cry hard enough"" which I heard in a 9-11 tribute which circulated the net. The rest of the CD is not my cup of tea but it is unique and other may enjoy it. I do appreciate alternative styles and Victoria Williams definitely has an unuaul style."
5,The Monster is outstanding,Just recieved my Monster and its great. Excellent price. I owned a Rolex Submariner and got tired of paying alot when it needed repairs. This watch is durable and keep excellent time. Great price thru Amazon and quick delivery
1,My Dad sent his watch back,This Black Monster was a Christmas present from us to my Dad. He so liked it but after a few weeks it started to freeze-up and stop and lose time. The thingy that you use to set the time also started to get wiggly and loose that it kinda dances when you move your hand. ALso my Dad noticed that the watch stored only about ten hours if he was not using it but before it used to store three days worth of power. We should have gotten him a Seiko that was Japanese (not this one which is made in Singapore). I dont know much about watches but Im a computer freak and I know good technology when I see it and this SIngaporean Black Monster is awful.
3,A Great Deal For the Money,"My Black Monster came brand new in original box with original papers.I would have given this watch 5 stars but the movement stopped working all together and i ended up returning the watch for a full refund.The lume Seiko uses is super bright.I may consider buying another Seiko Monster, however 2 of 2 Seiko Monsters i have ordered so far have been defective.For the money, this watch is a steal."
3,operation time,"since it is an automatic watch, the time of operation in the resting state is very short. the rest of the operation is ok"
1,review,"This watch looks cheap, the bezel is made from plastic and it is not precise and accurate. I'm not satisfied with this product of Seico. And not Japan movemant by the way, probably from China."
4,watch is fast.,"watch is bullet proof, never leaks, the illumination is great. don't get the rubber band it'll eventually split and fall apart. the metal is much better. I had to upgrade to the metal eventually and it cost me a lot more overall...watch however has one draw back and it runs fast.. it'll get 5 minutes fast within a month. annoying but not a deal breaker. it's heavy and you can probably knock someone unconscious with it."
5,Don't think twice!,"I really enjoy this watch. The value,look, and nuance is unbelievable. It just gives that impression that you can side with legendary watches out there."
2,Not for beginners or anybody else,There was very little instruction in this video. Telling kids to put their skis on edge without explaining what that means is worthless. They try to cover way to many skill levels and end up not helping any level. Watching advanced kids ski the half pipe doesn't help teach a beginner skier at all.
5,CCIE Lab Here I Come!!!!,"I have used Exam Cram books in the past and so naturally bought this one. Armed with this book and my experience I was able to pass the Written so now its onto the lab, oh boy!"
2,Not quite enough...,"I looked at this exam cram after I took my CCIE written and it did not cover questions that I had. I specifically looked for LOTS of questions that I saw on the exam and they just weren't in the exam cram. I saw a couple of mistakes (example, picture of RSRB has mismatching ring numbers). I think it's good to get an overview but it doesn't go deep enough to pass the exam. You definatly need other sources. I'm a firm believer that for the CCIE written, there's no 'easy' way to study and you won't find all the information you need in one book."
1,It is cheap,"I knew this would be cheap but so was the packaging. The top and back were dented but I decided to keep it. It put together easily but one of the castors does not seat well so it is wobbly.However, it does keep my tools together and dry.It ain't a Craftsman, but.................it is ok"
1,Junk,THIS ITEM IS MADE CHEAP WITH THIN METAL. THE WHEELS CAVED IN WHEN I TRIED TO MOVE IT AFTER TOOLS WERE ADDED. THE BOTTOM STORAGE FLOOR IS A SLIDE IN PANEL THAT WILL NOT HOLD HEAVY TOOLS WITHOUT FALLING THROUGH. WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK.
1,Need picture,"I will not buy this product because there is no picture. I mean, come on, what does it look like? If I can't see it to confirm it's what I want, I won't buy... And why is it listed as a toy? See what I mean??"
4,"Iowa, anyone?","Don't hesitate to buy or rent this very charming and approachable indy comedy. The cast, portraying the intricacies of relationships we can all relate to, was magnetic and utterly convincing to me. As I watched the film, I was thinking of people in my own life they reminded me of. Yes, I grew up in a small town by a river, too!I want to compliment in particular the cinematography and the beautiful location shots taken in a town in Iowa. The charming and apparently well kept riverfront town, coupled with some brilliant fall colors, provided a pleasant canvas for all the action.I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did!"
5,Possibly one of the greatest allegorical works today.,"Bright colorful photographs and detailed recipes codify and expand on the philosophy of living:""It's not your ingredients. It's how you cook it."""
5,Delightful AAA-oriented pop goodness,"I've been a big fan of James' music since his days with The Tories. While 'So Much for Secrets' is most definitely *not* from the same vein as the Jellyfish-esque power pop of his previous band, James demonstrates a lifetime's worth of evolution as a singer, songwriter and musician since his not-so-distant Tories days.Gotta agree with the first review - I've not gotten sick of this CD after 3 weeks of spinning it at least 1x/day. After week 1, I found myself looking beyond the lush harmonies and deft guitar/bass work (most of which is all James himself) and taking a closer look at the lyrics. Wow. Really thoughtful stuff. Then later, I found myself noticing some really subtle-yet-unusual and really interesting effects layered onto a couple of tracks -- the producer really outdid himself here.Net-net, this disc is an onion (in all the good ways). It's got a lot of flavor, plenty of layers to peel back, and might even make you cry a little if you're not careful."
2,blah book,this book was just OOOOKKKKK .. dont waste ur mon if it is over 4 dollars total..... buy used cheap copy instead..... it wasnt that long and didnt really touch on all the issues i wish it had.. overall its a no go
3,Heard It All Before,"This book is good, but it's like many other African American nonfictions floating out there. I read excerpts of this book in Essence magazine and expected something different, but I just got the same things out of it with the exception of a few parts. As an African American young woman myself, I did go through many of the issues that these women write about (am still going through them). However, I am disappointed to say that they mostly had the same issues (as they said, these problems almost go without saying in the Black female community)with different plot casings. When are they going to write a more obscure African American female story? Perhaps I can't really appreciate the writing because I'm not where these women seem to be per se, but at the same time I feel like they didn't try hard enough to encompass different ideas/issues of African American female body images."
4,DJ 360 - 33 Revolutions Per Minute,"DJ 360's debut, 33 Revolutions Per Minute, stitches together loose fragments of hip-hop, big beat and jazz to weave an intriguing cloth. The album opener, ""Something a Little Bit Different,"" has meandering keyboards backed up by a solid beat, while ""Tag Along (Come On)"" is a bouncy number. The album brings to mind other hip-hop fusion artists, most notably Pepe Deluxe. But there are some touches that are unique: the simultaneously delicate and stomping ""Piano Peace Pt. 1""; the Monster Island visit of ""Beware of Manholes""; or the skittering drum `n' bass of ""Piano Peace Pt. 2."" The closing track, ""Shh..."" goes for a quieter approach, calm and dreamy. There's plenty on this album to enjoy, so spin right in."
5,Did I Step Into A Time Machine?!,"By no means am I a critic, or qualified to critique music, musicians, or styles. What I do know is that Spanky and Our Gang/Elaine ""Spanky"" Macfarlan, were in a class unto themselves. And this Greatest Hits CD is quintessential Spanky & Our Gang. It contains a pot pouri of their multi-facited styles. It's a prizm emitting the spectrum of their vast talents in broadway, jazz, blues, r&b;, rock styles. Their musical abilities and impectible vocal harmonies are without equal (in my opinion). On as side note: I was not aware that their rendition of Stardust was the major impedus behind the formation of the Manhattan Transfer, until I read the liner/insert.Frankly, I'm wisked back to my high school and college days, volkswagon beetle, flower power days. You know, the more-or-less carefree days of youth. I had these songs on 8-track and I think I wore it out. The CD should last me until...well, hopefully I'll wear out before it does! :-)"
2,"Poor Quality, Difficult Assembly","This bike is a quite a dissapointment. It had five significant problems during assembly:- both brakes required adjustment (rubbed wheels)- Bottom braket required adjustment (too tight, did not turn)- reinstall derailer (improperly install - rubbed cogs)- true wheels (very out of alignment)- replace reflector (brocken)If you are not skilled at bike repair, I would avoid this one.Once assembled properly, the bike is OK. Quality is what I would expect for the price (low price, low quality)."
1,Animal Tracks of the Southeast States,the sketches are not very crisp and the descriptions are just like those in another book I read;Animal tracks of florida georgia and alabama. the books give tracks for some animals that dont seem to be relevant such as mice and rats. Who wants to track those. Harbor seals in North Georgia. They dont even have turkey tracks in the book. Horses are included like these are even a native species.
2,50% price increase?,"I bought these awhile ago and put off taking them because I was nursing and couldn't find any information on if they were safe or not. Previous reviews are correct.. They taste nasty and have dark spots. I ordered them before finding out they are only really supposed to be sold by health care professionals. But they worked. I took them and for the first time in a year, my constant bloating feeling went away. I also dropped 4 pounds that I had been working at for months to lose, in the first week. (The pills only lasted a week. Anyways, despite the oldness of them I decided to order another bottle until I could get in with my chiropractor, I got on amazon and they were $12. I didn't get the chance to order them right then and when I went back on today they are now selling for $24!!! Not worth it. Especially for old pills."
3,Ditto on the popped bubbles,"I concur with others who had a number of popped bubbles. Since it ships ""as is"" rolled up, edge bubbles and the first rolled layer had a lot of popped bubbles. We're using it to insulate windows so losing a foot or two wasn't critical and for the price it did the job. Just realize if you want pristine bubble wrap, it isn't that. Plus it appeared that the 24"" width was originally 48"" or larger and they just chopped it down the middle, so it wasn't a nice clean edge."
5,Totally Unauthorized but Totally Good,"Though it isn't as detailed as the SYBEX guide, which also includes Atomic Edition, this is a SUPER guide with tons of info. Also, it includes many pages on the BUILD program. There are decent maps and every secret is revealed, in a nicely-layed out walkthrough section. There are no screenshots but you don't really need them with the strategies provided here. Keep in mind that this guide does not include Atomic Edition so don't be surprised. You really should get this guide if you really need help in the game."
4,Not bad,"This wasn't bad and could have been better had Ms. Foster not rushed the ending. She built up the story for 300 pages and then wrapped everything up in a neat little bow in the last 25 pages. I didn't understand why she did this. It was like she had a page limit that she couldn't go over. I enjoyed the interplay between the characters especially some of the minor characters. You definitely should read Ms. Foster's earlier book, Jude's Law before this book as it explains how the two lead characters met and their attraction. This is a definite beach book. It's very lighthearted and easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick fun read."
4,Alternative history of England,"One of Daphne du Maurier's lesser-known books, Rule Britannia envisages an alternate history of England in the 1970s. In this alternate universe, plunged into economic depression and soaring unemployment, England decides not to join the European Economic Community (forerunner to the European Union). Its residents wake up one day to find communications cut, an American warship in the harbour, US marines setting up roadblocks and news that Britain was joining forces with the United States to form the USUK.A group of Cornish villagers becomes increasingly unhappy with the take-over of their land and start a shadowy rebellion, centring on an 80-year-old former actress, his brood of adopted troubled boys and her neighbours. The story is told through the eyes of her 20-year-old grand-daughter. A fascinating read."
3,Just a comment on a review,"One review here states:""The one peeve I have with the author, as with so most of the pseudo-journalists today, is that he consistantly referred to the Muslim god ""Allah"" as ""God."" Indeed, most of the time you read or hear an English translation of an Arabic source, ""Allah"" is usually rendered ""God."" It has to be pointed out that ""Allah"" is not the same person as ""God."" All that has to be pointed out to prove that point is that Allah has no son named Jesus Christ, though I could go on and on about the distinctions. Christians and Muslims do NOT worship the same Being.""Actually, Muslims DO believe they worship the same god as that revered by those they call the 'people of the book' - just that Mohammad's revelations were the last and final word on matters (superceding all others).The Muslim call to prayer begins ""la allah illa Allah"", which means EXACTLY, ""There is no god but God"". I hear it five times a day from a hundred mosques in this city."
2,Ehhh...,"Since I own tons of records by this work's focal artists, I figured I'd get this book. Not the best move, for a bunch of reasons. First off, as one writer referred to, it totally lacks organization. The chapters jump all over the place, making it hard to keep things in mind. Second, why should a work that deals with such lyrical and evocative music be written like a college term paper? Excuse me, Mr. Einarson, you're not proving a thesis, don't be afraid to inject some imagery! The BEST books about musical artists from this period (see Bud Scoppa's Byrds biography NOT Johnny Rogan's, and the wonderful ""CSN"") are better organized, more pictoral, and livelier! Man, if the times were as dry as Einarson's writing, this genre would never have come about!!!!!And how anyone could knock the Byrds' ""Untitled"" album is beyond me...."
5,Excellent for those who are clumsy!,"I bought a stepper and this tape and don't have any regrets. Leslie is cheerful and human. The tape is easy to follow and each move is explained well. I am slow to learn any workout moves and this tape was not at all a problem. The music is bad, but Leslie and the workout itself is so good that I am giving 5 stars. Buy this tape if you are new to exercize or stepping. It is a great introduction that you will return to."
4,Very Helpful,I purchased this DVD for my daughter who is a public school dance teacher. She has volunteered her time to help start the school's first cheerleading squad. She has informed me that this DVD was very helpful in preparing the students for their cheerleading tryouts. She would recommend this DVD for any beginning cheerleading squad.
1,"Stupid Clock Shuts Off, What is the Clock For if it Shuts Down?","Stupid Clock Shuts Off, What is the Clock For? Needs a Firmware update to keep the clock on. I actually had to buy a clock and put it on top, so I can tell what time it is.Poor Design."
4,NEW TO THE MAC,I am a PhD student researching in Central Mexico. I have emailed Detto 3 times and telephoned twice over 10 days. There has been no reply. Lousy customer service!
3,Saved a little time,"The product nade the move to my iMac from my PC a little easier, but I still had a lot of problems transferring my Outlook files. I finally had to do this manually."
2,Works....partially,"I bought this program chiefly because I had lots of MP3s that I wanted to move to my new iBook from my old PC. I was also glad to get my documents, pictures, etc on the new computer, but what I wanted most was to avoid re-downloading all that music. So of course, I got Move2Mac to move everything except my music. It did not appear to recognize that I had anything in my music folder on my PC, and therefore did not move the hundreds of MP3s. I tried everything I could think of--and spent a good few hours on it--and then gave up. Considering that they advertise that it moves everything including music files, I was pretty annoyed. I don't know whether others have had this problem; maybe I'm the only one. But if you mostly want to move music, there is probably a better and less expensive way!"
4,"Easy, reliable but slower than advertised","Maybe it was because I had lots of photos and video files to move, but it took overnight to transfer everything I wanted transferred. The good news is that everything transferred perfectly and went exactly where the program said it would go. Set up was easy and though I doubted it would work, it did. Just be patient if you have lots of photos or videos."
2,tries too hard,I really did not like this show at all....I am an alcoholic that has been in recovery 13 yrs....so I know the life of an alcoholic....for the most part the alcoholic is very secretive about being an alcoholic.....we don't think we have a problem and try very hard to keep everything secret....every aspect of this show is way too far over the top and not believeable....in almost every scene it is trying to shock us....it tris way too hard to shock us.....what a waste of Macy's talent.
2,LOVE US VERSION? DON'T BUY THIS!,"I had already watched the entire first season of SHAMELESS US, so the British version came off as a less-interesting imitation (even though the Brit version came first) with a far less-attractive cast."
5,Superbly gritty and darkly witty.,"The series chronicals the lifes of a tight knit, penniless and dysfunctional family from North Manchester in England.The acting is ever inch as gritty and realistic as the lives at the centre of the drama. It depicts the hard, edgy way of life for poverty trapped modern Britons and yet has a deeply emotive and strong bonded sense of love and loyalty inspite of the scams, violence and highly destructive lifestyles depicted.Not for the faint hearted but engagingly real, just try an ""F"" word count in one episode if you dare!Shameless is gritty, honest and incredibly funny. I challenge you not to connect with and feel for the characters depicted; even though you may wish to dismiss them and judge the harshly at the first outing. Excellent and superbly acted!"
5,Faithful translation to the original,"While not approved for LITURGICAL USE by the Catholic Church, this version IS approved for scholarly study. It is imbecillic to assume that this is merely an attempt at inclusive language. This translation is, in fact, the most faithful to the original Hebrew and Greek."
3,Not bad but needs better cleaning power,"If you look at the ingredients on the bottle, you're buying deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and alcohol ethoxylate (a surfactant). I found this product to have minimal cleaning power. It did remove general surface dirt, as evidenced by the rag I was using being dirty after rubbing. However, in any place where there was a spot, mark, or stain of anything, it would not remove it (or at least not remove it any better than water would have).The product is fairly inexpensive, and perhaps it's hard to create a more powerful cleaner that is still marble-safe. So, I'm not totally disappointed.But personally, I'd be happy to pay more for something that works better. If it doesn't work any better than alcohol or water, what's the point in ordering this? I might as well just mix alcohol and water at home."
4,Appears to work as advertised,"I have not complaints about this granite cleaner. It appears to work just fine, and has almost no odor. I use it 2 or 3 times a week on sealed granite and have no complaints."
5,Best Natural Stone Cleaner,"This is the best granite and marble cleaner I've ever used, though it's quite pricey. The smaller 24oz. bottle is actually less expensive (cost/ounce) than the one-gallon bottle."
1,Dose not clean channel bags,I bought it because of a recommendation that it cleans the orange Chanel leather bag but it did nothing.
2,"Good, but not good as the original","I was so excited to finally get a copy of Ivan and His Magic Pony on DVD, but ended up disappointed. I own the original on VHS and the DVD does not do it justice. Yes, the animation is the same but the dialog has changed. The songs alone are very different. I wish someone would just make a DVD version that is not different from the original. A childhood dream ruined."
4,Block set deosn't seem to match knives,"I love the new knives, however it seems the block set doesn't fit them appropriately. maybe I am a little naive about the sizes but it seems that the smallest knives have way too big a slot.... and why do they have 6 steak knives slots and sell the steak knives in sets of 4.... so you either have 4 or 8, neither of which go with the block...."
5,PLEASED,"I am very impressed with the quality of this knife set. They are a good weight and very balanced. They are super sharp. The block I received appears to be bamboo not the hardwood pictured, the block is made in China but its fine."
5,My Daddy Wrote This Book!,"""If Tomorrow Comes"" was written by a great writer; my Father. I know, you expect to hear that from his daugther but I speak as a fellow reader and writer. This book will pull you in from the beginning and keep you hyped 'til the very end. Every time you think you figured out what will happen next you he throws in another twist and takes you for wirlwind ride. I have never seen an end time book that opened my eyes so much and yet left me feeling warm and confident."
4,Excellent if you have a Greek friend to help!,Very detailed format. I am glad I have someone to help me as some of the lessons are confusing without added instruction. Definitely a book best suited for classroom instruction.
1,Too advanced,"I was looking for a workbook that would be good for beginners. Practice with vocabulary words with pictures and simple phrases. This one had fill in the blanks, but the long sentences were in Greek and the multiple choises for the blanks were in Greek. No pictures, no hints. My boyfriend (Greek) made the comment, ""Do they expect all the buyers to have a Greek boyfriend to teach it to them?"" Obviously, I should have bought the text book to go with it, but that might have been too advanced as well. I settled on CD's for the car and that's worked out much better."
5,Polyzap,Not a toy but a glue used to bond materials that regular superglues and models glues cannot bind as well as those that it can
1,Plays tracks in alphanumeric order,"This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get."
1,wow! really disappointing,"Great title, intriguing music. badly performed! the out of tune recorders hurt my ears. nice program notes. too bad about the musicians.a great recording if your interested in tarantellas is by Arpegiatta."
5,Enjoyable,"My two and half year old and I both enjoy this book. I don't mind reading it's rhyming, fun sentences again and again, my son always enjoys it... and he's not even really into firetrucks! It's a pleasant break from construction equipment!"
3,Could be a little better,Overall happy with the product. I do wish that it was a little thicker and maybe had a texture on the back so it wouldn't slide so easily on the table. Vey cute pattern though.
2,Break's apart way too easily,"I decided to go against the advice found in reviews and give this a shot. After about 10 minutes of playing with it it fell apart on me. I haven't bothered putting it back together yet, but it looks like a real mess to put back together. With plenty of alternatives for 2x2 cubes on the market, I think I'm going to look elsewhere eventually for a 2x2 and I would suggest you do the same. It baffles me that Rubik's would put this on the market."
2,JUNK,Falls apart way too easily. Pain in the rear to put back together. Don't waste your money on this peice of junk.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CUBE,"This cube is horrible. Mine turned absolutely horrible, even after lubrication. While trying to cut a barely missaligned corner the corner peice popped off, along with a peice of the mechanism, which was subsequently unrepairable. If you're shopping online, try to find an Eastsheen 2x2 somewhere, they are far better, and larger. So your not trying to work a tiny little cube."
2,False Advertising--No stand included!!!,"My son is a cube fanatic and really wanted The ice cube with its stand to add to his collection. The first time i ordered him this cube, it was sent to someone else by accident. They were honest and gave it to us, but it had been opened and the stand was missing. we thought the people who accidently received it threw the stand out. Since my son really wanted the stand, but loves cubes, and we didn't know the circumstances of the missing stand, we just ordered another one. We received the new one today, but my son says it looks like the seller carefully cut a small hole in it and purposely removed the stand. I found it hard to believe the seller would do that, because the description said a stand would come with it. Now looking back, i wonder if the first time we ordered it, the stand was also removed by the seller. My son loves rubik's cubes and got the cube he wanted, but he specifically wanted the stand to go with it. Very disappointing."
1,Would be great if it turned...,"It's small and cute and fun if only it would work!!! It barely turns, it doesn't cut corners at all, it's the worst cube rubik's has made in all their collection of cubes. Forget speed cubing, you'd be lucky if you can solve it in 10 minutes cause you have to literally wrestle with the damn thing. Save your money and opt for a LanLan or a Ghost Hand. Even Eastsheens are better than this crap. BTW all the other cubes are much bigger than this one but you can find them at about the same price."
1,Mr. Fast Should Have Gone Fishing for a Better Editor,"I really enjoyed several of Howard Fast's other books, but this one is a disappointment. Although many of the characters are interesting, and the setting is of special interest to me (since I grew up in Stamford, CT, only a few miles from Greenwich), the book fails to make the larger point that it is so obviously trying to make. It fails so badly that I'm not even sure what that larger point is. The book is also very clumsily edited. Misuses of words abound. Perhaps the worst example is when the author refers to Sally as a socially inept person who makes many ""gaffs"" when she speaks. A ""gaff"" is a piece of fishing equipment. Social errors are ""gaffes."" Mistakes like this distract from the story. Mr. Fast should go fishing for a better editor for his next book."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"The novel within this novel deals with the collective guilt of worldwide atrocities, and seems to have a dramatic effect on its readers. Not so this book. It's more like Peyton Place on speed, with everyone self-destructing at the end. ""Quick reading"" is the best I can say about this novel. It has no weight, and it will probably make a dandy screenplay. I am writing this review within minutes after having finished it, because I am certain that by tomorrow morning I will have forgotten everything about it."
4,Prophetic Fulfillment,"I felt the strong point of this movie was the inclusion of fulfillment of prophecy as the story unfolds. Those details triggered interest and questions from my adult son. Of course, the heart felt human emotions of Mary and Joseph were also a plus.Some of the scenes were too complicated for my six-year old grandchild to comprehend and there were lots of questions along the way. It is a good movie to have available at Christmastime."
5,GOD'S CHOSEN ONE,"SUCH A GREAT STORY. WELL WRITTEN AND PORTRAYED BY ALL. DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. OH, YEA THE CUST SERVICE AND RECEIPT OF ITEMS WAS AN A+. WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS COMPANY."
5,Edifying movie,"The attention to detail, authenticity to the time and place and most importantly, keeping the story close to the Biblical truth, make this a very enjoyable and enlightening movie. It drew me into the real story that brings true hope, joy and real love into the world, Jesus' birth, Immanuel, God with us. This story never gets old!"
5,Best Nativity Movie I've Ever Seen!,"I really loved this movie. It will be a regular part of my family's Christmas traditions from now on. The producers made great effort to stay faithful to the scriptures, and they succeeded. They also managed to avoid telling this well-known tale in a ""canned"", just-the -facts kind of way. Some have criticized the movie for its artistic license, such as putting a little humor in surrounding the Wise Men (one critic even likened them to ""the 3 Wise Guys""). Having seen the movie now, I can say this criticism is unmerited-- the limited artistic license they took was just right and helped make the movie the delight that it is. My only (small) quibble is that they should have put more special effects into the angel Gabriel. Still, two thumbs up!"
4,Honor the Lord in everything...,"A good story that could have been a great movie. Illustrative,biblically accurate...but, what happened to Mary and Joseph? Mary did you know that your babe would walk on water, that he would die for you? Aparently, the actress (or the director)is not familiar with the beautiful truth and meaning of Christmas...I still love the movie and have watch it a few times but think that the Lord is due for a MAGNIFICENT Christian movie that honors Him the way He deserves...with ALL the elements of an excellent work."
5,excellent movie,"filmed along the route that Joseph and Mary would have actually walked !!Fantastic cast, movie, costumes, authenticity perfect.....a must anytime of the yearmusic is beautiful !!!!!!!1"
2,"Dreary, shallow and wooden, sigh....","I really wanted to like this movie, as biblical subjects always interest me. But this film is a dreary and uninspir/ed/ing treatment of the Christmas story, all but ruined for me by the lead actress's wooden, callow performance. Surprising, since Castle-Hughes was so fine in the Whalerider film. She has much the same facial expression throughout the movie, no matter the emotional context of each scene. The actor playing Joseph, Oscar Isaac, gave much more depth to his character--a charming and tender performance.The story itself is rendered in a flatly traditional fashion, without any of the warm beauty one might hope for given the Christmas theme. (I'm reminded of the gorgeous birth-of-Christ preface to 1959's Ben Hur--just a few minutes, but oh so emotionally evocative!)All in all, not much to remember or hold dear in this movie. Too bad."
3,A Disappointment Compared To IFO,"One of the most anticipated goatrance albums of all time has finally arrived, but be warned, it may not be quite what you were expecting. There is a lot of variation in the extraneous noise, but it is severely lacking in the melodic musical department, for there is rarely more than 3 notes of variation in the melody. At times, it manages to vaguely resemble what we liked so much about I.F.O., but it seems to be missing that extra oomph to take it to the next level. Much of it is cluttered with attempts to build complexity that miss the mark, and do not denote any significant talent. Also, it has at times a very choppy and abrupt feel. If you like blips, bleeps, pops, and squeaks, this album is for you. If you like smooth flowing melodic trance with plenty of grooves, you may want to look elsewhere. Overall, not a bad album, but a bit of a let down from the highly acclaimed all-star Pleiadians."
2,"Nice, but","I received this as a gift and could not wait to get a quiet moment to open this book and escape. I did like the beautiful photos, however found that the author had too many of the same area and could have done so much more. The last pages contained favorite beach areas but did not have any photos which I would of liked. Will go back to the book again someday but not what I was hoping for."
5,Stunning,"I own a maximum of ten albums which bring me back to an EXACT time and place. This is one of those albums. This album was like meeting the first guy who could stare STRAIGHT through me. But it is tragic and sad, rather than threatening. And absolutely beautiful."
2,Storries originally from other Richard Scarry books,"I was disappointed with Richard Scarry's Best Storybook Ever. I grew up on Richard Scarry books, and previously purchased Cars and Trucks and Things that Go. I expected this book to be as original as the other books.As far as I could tell, all of the 2-3 page stories in this book originally appeared in other Richard Scarry books. Thus, it is less coherent than other Richard Scarry books."
1,Incomplete Stories,The I Am A Bunny story is a partial version of the original story. I imagine that this is probably the case of the other stories as well. I recommend obtaining the complete story books rather than this collection of partial stories in one book.
3,Bad sound quality,"I have listened to this cd and quite frankly, the sound (remaster) in my opinion, is terrible. I also own the Supremes 25th Anniversary collection and that sounds much better - go figure. I would not recommend this cd nor the volume 2 that is due to be released later this month which will probably sound just as terrible. I bought this cd based upon other reviewers opinion and now that I have listened to it, I don't know how they can say the sound is terrific!"
2,Disappointed,"My first Supremes collection purchase on CD. It lacks the warm, full richness I've associated with vinyl.Deep bass and sharp handclaps but the midrange isn't there.Is it a bad mixing job or have I just become used to what I hear on the radio?Compare the snare drum on Phil Collins version of You Can't Hurry Love to the snare drum on this mix.I know, this isn't about drums but it's difficult to express audio impressions with written words.I feel the reproduction quality (remix?) of this collection is substandard.I'm looking for an enjoyable Supremes collection and this isn't it."
2,disappointed,"Actually the story could have been ok. The idea of a bone collector is, after all, pretty scary. I read this for the story or I finished reading this for the story. The writing of thestory was really elementary. There was no mood, the descriptions were limited at best, and the sentences were pure ""Plain Jane"". Itwasn't all that tense or suspenceful. I could and did put it down once or twice. Read Jeffrey Dever,James Lee Burke, Robert Crais and others for both plot and writing."
4,Just Like You're On the Bike!,"This game is highly recommended, as it is the closest to the real thing that I've seen yet. It is also very inexpensive unlike many other games out there. If you like riding motorcycles, or just enjoy the sport, you have to get this game!"
5,Must have for any PJ fan,Its always nice to see a band hard at work in the studio. Great interaction between everyone. Jack Irons is ok but I'm a huge Matt Cameron fan.
4,"Great film, a bit short though",This documentary shows how the band created the album yield without entering in too many details (The film lasts about 45 minutes).
4,Solid Video,"Pearl Jam are not known to be in the spotlight much, so this video is a very pleasant surprise. The art direction is a bit flimsy, though. But for Peal Jam fans, a good buy. Can't wait for their next DVD, Pearl Jam: Touring Band 2000."
4,Album recording and interviews from a truly amazing band,"""Single Video Theory"", the long awaited home video from one of the most amazing bands of our time. It's a glimpse at their recording process for their latest record ""Yield"", as well as live studio recording of those songs, candid interviews with band members, Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard, Jack Irons, Mike McCready and Ed Vedder. I recommend this video for any fan of Pearl Jam or music similar to theirs; you'll recieve the truth behind this well-rumored band."
2,Not much to fuss about,"So terribly sorry to disappoint anyone, but this DVD is a waste of my (and your) hard earned dollars. I LOVE PEARL JAM, I have been to many concerts, and I collect every piece of their music I can get my hands on, and I have to say, this is the only one that isn't worth it.The recordings, of course, are immaculate, at least this part is enjoyable. But the constant zooming in on pretty boy Ed Vedder's chin cleft got a little nauseating after a while. I just wanted to put the YEILD album on, so I could listen to the SAME EXACT THING, and not have to watch this phoney crap. I miss the introvert pearl jam who wouldn't think of being so vain, and who would put the MUSIC FIRST, before their cute little interviews in which they answer tough questions such as ""What does Pearl Jam mean to you??"" Don't waste your time wondering whether or not you should buy this dvd - touring band 2000 is much more what you're looking for if you're into the MUSIC."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Girl sold into sex slavery by mum to dodgy lecher guy, uses laterfound hotness for politics. Becomes happy.Yeah, you are right, that doesn't sound that interesting. This book doesn't work too well as a fantasy, and it isn't an erotic novel, either, and is just way, way too long. However, I suppose you could use it for a paperweight. It is set in the same world that the considerably better Shardik is, but earlier in time."
2,Not the worst read,"The best I can say for this book is that it's not the worst one I've hung in there for hundreds of pages and tried to get interested in before I gave up. The characters are uninspiring and therefore no matter how involved the action gets it never rises to the level of true adventure. However, I felt the same about the Da Vinci Code and look how popular that became."
1,What???,"Okay, maybe it's my own fault because I assumed it was a fantasy, as I found it in the fantasy section of a used book store. This is not fantasy, it's erotica. What the heck is with this book?! I only read the first two chapters and was really turned off from the story. Maia is naked and her stepfather masturbates, then in the next chapter they have sex! Not to mention she is 15 and he's 40. All in the first 27 pages! Not for me. Messed up, in my opinion."
4,"It's a ""must"" buy!",That's the first time I've ever listened to a French Rock album...try it!...it's worth buyin'! ...Nothin' to lose!
5,Miracle,"Inspirational Movie, it is used to show how obstacles can be overcomed. Unconventional methods to achieve goals. Not only is this movie entertaining, it has many lessons for coaches. Hard work pays off."
5,BEST MOVIE,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT REMINDS US ALL HOW GREAT THE REAL AMERICAN SPIRIT CAN BE, EVEN AGAINST ALL ODDS!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Entertaining Movie,"Very entertaining movie. Perfectly done, building up the the big game. Just like an old ""Rocky"" movie, but way better"
5,Miracle,Great movie based on a true story. You don't have to be a sports fan or a hockey fan to realize the amazing effort put into the team in 1980. Shows grit and determination and Kurt Russell is Herb Brooks in this film.A good family film. I highly recommended.
3,I'm Not A Big Hockey Fan,"Sports movies aren't my thing. REMEMBER THE TITANS was an okay movie, but this didn't do it for me because I'm not much into sports except baseball. This is based on a true story, but it wasn't all that great. I know everyone else just absolutely loved this movie, I wanted to read a book."
5,Short & Sweet,"We have 2 books by Wong Herbert Yee and my 15-month old loves them. The illustrations are adorable and even after reading it multiple times to him, I still enjoy it."
1,Rest in Peace,"Everything I know about a bitter wall-flower past her bloom destined to die alone and found months later half eaten by her dog, I learned from this book."
1,Not the Real Thing,"It's odd that RUBBERmaid would chose to make its Ace-branded comb out of something other than the hard RUBBER that the original Ace company used, but these combs are plastic. The ""Ace"" site tries to insinuate that they are still hard rubber, by talking about the material originally used, while avoiding any explicit claims about what they are now using. The insinuation may not cross the line of actual fraud, but it's unethical."
1,Cheap. Plastic. Chinese. Need I say more?,"The legendary Ace Hard Rubber Comb belongs to history, it seems. This product comes with ""Made in China"" in tiny letters on the package, so you can probably guess the quality. They break in your pocket, I have gone through 3 in six months before giving up in disgust. The original Ace comb never broke, I could carry one for years without problems. I usually lost it eventually but it never broke. This is yet another case of a big corporation buying up a small company so they can put out cheap crap under the respected name.If you want a pocket comb of equal quality to the Ace, look for the packages of 6 or more that come at a 49 cent unit price. Paying three dollars for a cheap plastic comb is ridiculous."
4,Good start for worms in the classroom,"Teachers: This book will give you confidence in teaching about worms and composting. Intermediate primary students are also able to read and understand the text. Some of the sections include ""Starting a vermi-composter,"" ""Feeding your worms,"" ""How a worm eats,"" and a cute fairy tale that demonstrates the importance of worms. This book is an excellent teacher resource."
4,Corpse Rocks!,Danny Elfman is an absolute genius. His compilation captures the true essence of the movie. Fun to blast in my Jeep!
4,Pretty Tight CD,"As far as differences... of this cd go...there arent any, except for the one extra track, which is pretty hot. So if you like the urban beats and hardcore lyrics of the original Muggs Presents...The Soul Assassins Chapter 2... for onelittle track, go ahead, but dont expect anything else but one extra track..."
5,A Runner's Anthology,This collection of stories by ultrarunners will captivate you and pull you into the sport. You'll also find inspiration for your own ultramarathon.
4,It's REALLY Not That bad! Really!,"Okay...so most of them are not the ORIGINAL recordings, but as far as I can tell they are by the original artists in new stereo recordings.Personally, I actually LIKE this set because it collects a lot of really great 60's pop songs in one convenient collection -and you you gotta love that Flower-Power packaging! I keep this CD right there alongside my Austin Powers soundtracks.My only gripe is that each CD is less than 30 minutes, so there was really no need to put them on two separate discs. I burned them both onto one CD and use that for listening most of the time."
1,Factually Incorrect,"Though it is a nice book, and maybe YOU don't care whether they get the details right, the book is factually incorrect on one topic: it states that the phases of the moon are caused by the earth's shadow falling on the moon. I couldn't believe such a huge mistake would make it through the editorial process, through the printers, and all the way to bookstores, so I looked it up to double-check myself. If you don't believe me look at the wikipedia article on ""phases of the moon"".While I don't expect my 5.5-year-old to understand all of the intricacies of planetary orbits, this is a basic fact that is WRONG. I tried to find the publisher online but so far have not (i.e. could not find ""Cartwheel Books"" and could not find Cartwheel's own section on Scholastic's site)."
3,Tolerable introduction,"This series is an imitation of the Eyewitness format for younger readers. It is most appropriate for ages 2-5.This book discusses the Earth as a planet, the layers of the earth, caves and volcanoes, day and nightconstellations, and the solar system. Its strength is its breadth. Its weakness is its shallowness and its overgeneralizations and one factually incorrect section--this sort of problem plagues this series, I fear."
5,"Jackie DeShannon's ""You Know Me""","Jackie Deshannon has not lost a beat over the years - her new offerings actually best her many hits of the past with ballads that touch the soul and, as the LA Times proffered in their review of her recent LA live appearance at the Whisky, the E-Street band has nothing on her rockability! She's great!"
4,"Great story, badly written","This book is so badly written, it is comparable to junior high school English essays. Terrible!But the story of this strong and smart Chinese woman carries the book despite the terrible writing.Polly, a name thrust on her by her owner in California, is a Chinese peasant girl who is sold into slavery by her impoverished family. Eventually, in California's ""wild west,"" and with her consent, a white friend bought her out of her concubinage and they ran a boarding house together. Later, their relationship blossomed into something more serious. Since an interracial relationship in those days was intolerable, they bought a farm far from the rest of the world on a creek named Polly Creek after her. There, they both lived happily ever after until their deaths.The story of Polly's survival skills, inventiveness, hard work and great love is what this book is all about. I learned alot about self-reliance and creative thinking."
1,Poor writing doesn't do story justice,"I can't agree any more with the reviews that have pointed out the poor writing in this book. As a fan of stories about Chinese Americans and of historical fiction, I was sorely disappointed with this novel; what could be emotionally-moving scenes just aren't because of the ""see jane run"" kinds of descriptions. There is no skillful subtlety in this novel. I normally don't like to be this publicly critical, but this is one of the only times I've felt this strongly about something."
5,The Ravencliff Bride -- a great read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. Ms. Thompson has woven an intriguing tale with an unusual twist. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good gothic, or just a good read. You won't be disappointed."
2,I was bored!,"I didn't much enjoy this book. The hero was way to whiney and wordy, and the heroine was waspish - and what is with her infatuation with the dog? Another thing I didn't understand is why the hero kept all the staff at the manor. He should have sent them away. Both the hero and heroine were thoroughly unlikeable."
4,Good not Great,Good quality sound for the price. Nice looking and quality built. Back and Channel speaker are little big. Blah bl
2,Not All That,"If you have limited space you might like these, but I thought they sounded poor for such a respected name. I replaced them with Acoustech speakers and enjoying the best sound ever."
4,Onkyo HT540 7.1 home theater system,"Needed A 7.1 setup for gaming room. Price was right, sound is great, sub needs some tweakin, over all cannot beat this system for the price. music, but gaming and movies is what this sytem is for.Paired these speakers with Onkyo 608 reciever and its awesome. Amazon was good with shipping too."
5,Around the World in 80 Days DVD,"The DVD was excellent. Previously I purchased a VHS tape version which unfortunately contained only HALF the series episodes. The DVD, however, was complete."
1,PURE CRAP,"THIS DVD REALLY STINKS, AND ITS ONE MORE REASON AMERICA IS GOING TO DOWN.FIRST I PUT THE DVD ON THINKING IM ABOUT TO WATCH MUSIC VIDEOS, AND I HAVE TO RUN TO STOP THE DISC FROM PLAYING TO MAKE SURE ITS GEORGE MICHAEL AND NOT AN ADULT FILM ACCIDENTALLY SENT TO ME.IM NOT KIDDING.IT STARTS OUT WITH ACUAL ADULT FOOTAGE.THEN THE WHOLE FIRST VIDEO IS ALL HOMOSEXUALITY.I REALLY WAS OFFENDED AND COULD BARLEY SIT THROUGH IT. NO CLASS AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT BUY IT. IF NOT I WOULD BE CAREFUL. THIS IS NOT A DVD TO JUST POP IN AND ENJOY EXPECALLY WITH CHILDREN IN THE ROOM! TOTAL TRASH. I AM NO LONGER A GEORGE MICHAEL FAN."
5,"Sled Storm- If it isn't snowing out, you'll wish it was!",This is an excellent racing game. The challenges are progressive. Building on prior success allows greater attributes of the game to become available. Bad news is you must be successful for a series of races to achieve the next plateau. Without completion there is no way to save your progress...back to the beginning. For you SLED lovers you'll wish you were out on the trails rather than at home. But if you can ride why not FLY with Sled Storm. The ariels the players can perform will leave you wishing you were sixteen again!
5,I hope we see a sequel to SABLE very soon!,"I have been a fan of Mike Grell's comic work for years. Jon Sable, Freelance is considered by many to be his best work. His first novel, SABLE, takes the story of those first five or six issues and instead of just rewriting it into prose, creates something new. For fans of the series, it does not just rehash events depicted in the comic book. Some minor details are changed, but many of the gaps of Sable's story present in the comic series are detailed here. It also finally answers the question I have had for years: ""Who IS the white-haired man?"" For people discovering this character for the first time, this is an incredible action/mystery read, with a lot of humanity in the protagonist. Some of the sequences are raw, but match in tone to the environment that two-thirds of the book takes place: Africa. The detail is rich and there are many humorous moments. I recommend this book to anyone, comic and non-comic readers alike."
3,Left turn is not so great.,"The first two tracks on this EP are amazing. Unfortunately, it takes a mellow left turn at track three. The remainder of the EP is good, but does not compare to the first two tracks that simply make you want to drop everything and just move."
1,Battery charger for MuVo Slim,"I received the product on time as stated.Now for the bad news: it's a piece of junk. The $25.00 cost was outrageous for a simple plastic battery holder that can be purchased for $2.99 at Fry's, less than the shipping cost. It doesn't work as warranted, it doesn't charge the battery in my MP3 player, just supplies power.By the way, it was shipped inside a FEDEX bag, which was stuffed inside a USPS standard envelope. That was how it was delivered, by the USPS.I am disappointed with this product. You need to have an evaluation team to look at what you are putting Amazon's reputation on the line for.Thanks for the opportunity to share my edge of the fence decision on whether or not I shop at Amazon again.Norman Mushnick"
3,Could have been better!,This book focus more on the writer's biography than anything else. Little scientifical explanations are given considering the bulk of the book. Very narrow and somewhat shallow. Overall: Mediocre.
5,A stunning genuine medieval deck for advanced tarot readers.,"There are so many ""medieval"" tarot decks available now, but almost all of them are unconvincing modern interpretations. This deck is the real thing, a genuine facsimile of one of the earliest known decks. Tooled gilt backgrounds and hauntingly sparse and beautiful pictures make this deck a joy to use. I would only recommend it for advanced readers, though, as the Minor Arcana consists of the Suit symbols only, with no pictures to signify the cards meanings."
1,Worst Sunburn Ever,"Since our son was born, we've been using Coppertone Water Babies sunscreen, but didn't like that it stung if it got into his eyes. When we found this, we were thrilled. I even put it on my hands and rubbed it into my eyes to make sure it was truly ""tear free"". In that respect, it's great. However, we've used it twice on our son. The first time (last weekend), he got a little bit red, but today, after being in the sun for only two hours, he's got the worst sunburn ever. I'm devastated since I'm very careful about his sun exposure (we're both fair-skinned). In the year and a half of using Water Babies, he NEVER had a sunburn. I also used this sunscreen today and I am sporting the worst burn of my life as well...it looks as though we went without any sunblock at all. I hope someone can learn from our bad experience."
2,Worked for only 13 months,"This sharpener did a great job for 13 months and now it has stopped putting a sharp point on pencils. I contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement under their 7 year warranty but was told that ""it sounds like the cutters are wearing out. The cutters are considered a normal wearing part. Our warranty is a limited warranty and does not cover wear and tear or normal wearing parts.""They then recommended that I switch to a model with replaceable blades. I doubt I am going to go that route since it appears that the replaceable blades are nowhere to be found. Even the Bostitch office website doesn't show any retailers that carry it.Time to go to Costco and get one that I know can be returned if it fails."
5,Heavy Duty,"I bought this sharpener for my classroom. It's superior to any other electric sharpener I've owned or used in the classroom. The motor is very strong and smooth, more than capable of the 100 or so sharpening cycles it performs every schoolday."
4,Great tool!,"My children are great readers, (I taught them using Hooked on Phonics) but keeping up with their unending demand for new books is a full-time job. This book is a great help, it offers quality books my children love with values and ideas I want to expose them to. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is I have had trouble locating some titles."
5,Best Buy Around!,"I have two of these myself so I can take one to Florida where we winter. I have purchased several (can't remember how many I have given as gifts), and everyone I give it to feels the same as I do! Efortless way to bake potatoes. I do both regular and sweet potatoes in it and they always come out great. Saves time and the use of the oven on hot days. You can't appreciate it until you use it!"
5,Potatos and more,"I had one of these when I was married and lost it with the rest of my stuff. As soon as I got my microwave, I ordered this cooker. Have never found them in the store. I cook nearly every veggie in it. Corn on the cobb, squash, frozen vegs and more. This is the most used tool in my kitchen. When you wash the veggie leave the water on and it will cook perfectly. You will have to experiment a little to get the timing down... usually its 1 or 2 minutes for fresh stuff. Get it, you'll love it."
4,"Very informative, but I have a question...","This is a great pbs production and I definitely want to show it to my students! But what is the title of the movie, from which Time Travel shows us scenes of a man trying to shoot Hitler from his room? I may want to show that movie to my students too... Thanks, if anyone knows!"
4,Ambient drum-and-bass?,"High-impact, rapid-fire drumbeats and rumbly basslines pace this album with a manic ambience (ambulance?). Exploring some new aural space, Time Shard looks to a new tomorrow."
3,Thank You Evidence & Alchemist!,"Chase The Clouds Away was the song off of Evidence's Weatherman album. Alchemist produced it, Evidence laced it. I had to find the sample. So after some research i came across The Smith Connection. I hated to pay that import price but what choice did i really have? Great music! Not worth the import price but ""music makes me happy"" Wish I Had You was the name of the song the Alchemist sampled & it is truly a beautiful song. It gives me goosebumps. So much music people including myself just don't know about."
2,"Beautiful voice, dull arrangements","Cabaret CDs are loaded with tenors, so it's welcome to hear a new baritone. And one with such a resonant instrument. Too bad Koelbl doesn't bring much personality to anything he sings, and the arrangements aren't distinctive enough to make him shine. Nice try though."
3,"Nice guide for beginners, with some info for experienced DV'ers","All things considered this book was just barely worth the price for anyone with some basic background knowledge of the subject, however it was very poorly edited/published exactly as other reviews were quick and clear to state.Fortunately, I read these reviews and was prepared, but some of the publishing and editing errors were well beyond expectations and reasonability. Paragraphs ending in mid-stream on one page, with new subjects and wording starting on the subsequent page....with no hint of the remainder of the unfinished paragraphs anywhere in the book.I considered sending it back for a refund (before and after I read the entire book), just because the problem is so glaring!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is just dull. There's nothing in here a parent wouldn't naturally think of on their own to coax a laugh out of their baby. It's completely devoid of any imaginative or creative content. Heck, I don't think the little tricks in here even WORK. Skip this one for sure."
5,How can you pass this up,"If you are from North America, like I am, then you probably missed out on the videos for ""Break Me Shake Me"" and ""Tears of Pearls"". This is dvd/video is worth buying simply to see those videos. It does only contain 5 videos, but they are so much fun to watch, especially seeing the evolution of Darren from dreds to short short hair."
5,It's Fantastic!!! I highly recommend it!,"I own this video and have watched it numeous times. Everytime I see it, I get this sudden rush. The videos show alot of feeling and you can really get into the mood of the songs. The Tears Of Pearls video is quite the entertainment!"
1,"""Never Forever""...watch this trashy loser!!","How about NO stars? FIRST, the premise is preposterous!! Gimme a break, NOBODY gets suicidal just because God blesses them with birth control!! Unless of course they are SERIOUSLY mentally ill & then they should be in a mental hospital--not trying to have a kid!! And being unfaithful just because he can't knock you up--get real--she didn't Love him in the first place!! Marriage is about a lot more than kids--can't we get past the sexist, pro-natalist notion that EVERYbody has to have a kid & just let the child-free enjoy life!!"
5,So sad!,One of the best movies I've ever seen! It was a very tragic story line that had a happy ending! I really recommend this movie! I love it!
4,great little steamer,"I bought this steamer in an attempt at a healthier and quicker way to cook my veggies. Score! It is easy to use, easy to clean, and does the job well."
4,Pretty good product,"Well this device works exactly as it should. Steams veggies nice and quick in the microwave with minimal clean up. Its also dishwasher safe which is also a plus. I find myself using it less than I thought I would because of the absolutely tiny capacity (like 2 cups maybe?). I don't know about the average person, but I eat steamed veggies by the plateful and my 7-qt Black and Decker food steamer is a much more useful tool in my opinion."
4,Yes it is Mini,"I really like the way this product is made. The seperate parts make it very convenient and keep you from burning your hands. The only reason I took away a star is if you have a larger appetite or trying to steam for two it really is a ""MINI"". Very easy to use!!!"
5,Works Great,This thing working amazing. I have been using it everyday and now I am able to incorporate vegetables into my diet. My fridge is stacked with frozen vegetables and I am able to steam them perfectly with this thing. I love it!
3,Too small to be useful,"We eat pretty large portions of veggies in my home, so I found this to be even to small for a single serving."
5,Simplicity,"This little steamer is just the right size for a single serving. Makes it so simple to fix an individual serving that you don't have any excuse not to cook and eat your vegies. Steams well, and cleans up easy."
3,Unsatisfying Ending,"If other reviewers have read all of Bentley Little's books like I have, they must admit that this is not one of his stronger stories. Yes, the first half has all the makings of another Little classic, but it falls apart at the end when all the mysteries are explained in the last 30 pages. If Bentley had peppered the novel with clues to what was happening from the beginning, I would have been more forgiving, but everything was so conveniently tied up that I could tell he was fighting to come up with a good ending. He did the best he could, and I'm sure we'll see more great things from this underrated horror author in the future. Check out ""The Store"", ""The Association"", or ""The Store"" for some of his stronger work."
2,Dissapointed,"This is the second ""Little"" book that I've read, the first one being The Store. I will remember this name so that I don't buy another of his books. The man uses the same formula again and again, and it's not a good one. The characters were shallow, the plot went all over the place, and the ending was a mess. Mister Little seems to think that if he throws everything including the kitchen sink into his books that it makes good writing,it does not. Leaving the stage littered with bodies and killing off one of the main characters in the end is the work of a hack, not a talented writer."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed with this novel and expected something completely different. I found it to be a little too ""out there"" and had to force myself to finish the book."
1,a resort....in the middle of no-where??,"This is a strange and, to me, boring book. It drags on and on and on, seemingly goes no-where. Little goes into detail on everything and almost like Stephen King <yawn> he goes into too much detail. My advice is to get to the point, and make it interesting. Also, it is obvious by the middle of the book, what this book is about.Some parts were funny and some parts scary but all in all, not a good read. I would recommend the Association, one of his BEST books there, or better yet, try Graham Masterton if you really want the chills. His books are beyond belief!"
2,Customer Service is anything but,"I like this magazine. Full Stop. The problem is, when I called customer service, and I use that term in it's loosest possible connotation, they said they couldn't tell me where I could buy their magazine in London. Not outer Slobovia. London. They said yes, they do distribute to retailers in London, they just couldn't tell me who they might be. Hmmm."
5,A Playwright that breaks the traditional rules of Theatre,"Pirandello blurs the lines between illision and reality. He questions the traditional mind set of theatre and allows for the ""Characters"" to become more real with there illisons then the actors. A groundbreaking play that set the example for many other abusurdist in the field. An excellent performance piece."
3,Bay Cove,THis is an older thriller. Classic. It was pretty good in its time. its really not all that bad. I would probably recommend it around Hollween.
3,Wrong end of the telescope,"It should have started with the coven practicing magic 300 years ago to set the scene. Providing the LeBrons with yuppie credentials was the wrong way to start the movie. The movie should have been about the coven discovering Pamela Sue Martin- not the other way around. The supporting cast was an untapped resource of potentially golden proportions. It should have shown her drawn into their rituals unwittingly, instead of showing her figuring out the totally obvious half an hour after the audience.But PSM is a Dynasty brat- beyond criticism for those of us still living for the Carringtons and the Colbys. Fallon would have straightened out these New England biddies right away."
2,Just not Enough to pass the exam,"The exam is heavily concentrated on DNS. In addition, the book is oriented on how to do the basic administration of Server 2003. The questions on the exam are much more difficult than the material presented in the book. The book is good for a general overview of the new product. However, to pass the exam you must really dig into the product with hands on the server. A much better product to use would be the Minasi book for server 2003 plus pulling ever resource from technet on DNS. Neither books covers the detail of DNS that is needed to pass the exam."
1,Typical Micro$oft press,"It's typical Micro$oft press garbage. First off, it reads like stereo instructions. Second, it lacks any real depth, without a doubt not nearly enough to pass this exam. I spent a good hour in a local bookstore browsing through this title before deciding to go with another vendor."
3,*** ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC TELEVISION ***,"i dont regret buying this set! the shows are interesting and nostalgic to me. the content of the stories are not quite on the level of the untouchables but they are way higher than dragnet in my opinion. the people who put this set together did a very good job with the materials they had to work with.im watching these episodes on a 65"" large screen and its very watchable if you adjust your brightness control and sometimes your treble control on your audio.im so glad they put this out because previously the copies available were horrible quality, if you could find them,and they were not sold cheap. if your looking for hi def video quality go out and buy csi or something not so rare. im personaly glad m squad is now available."
4,Techno-Ethnic Beats,"I would if I could give this 4.5 stars. It doesn't rate 5 stars because the second disc is not as strong as the first, which is superb. Sometimes, I play the first disc ten consecutive times. Toby really lays down the techno-ethnic groove and it is addictive. This is his tribute to Tibet and Tibet without the Chinese invaders.While the USA invaded Iraq for no reason, it has stood by and allowed China to invade and rape Tibet. It is similar to the USA allowing the Soviet Union to invade Hungary during 1956. Obviously, we are a nation of hypocrites. But, this is not a political album and does not preach any message. It is simply an excellent techno-ethnic groove that is easy to enjoy. Thanks Toby (the man behind Banco de Gaia)."
4,Not Bad,"Hanging eye is unusually large. Only finished on one side -- the other side is hollow. Overall not bad with a nice design, but slightly disappointing in the execution."
4,Fractions for Fun,This book is amazingly helpful for teachers in the middle grades who are reviewing the operations of fractions.
4,Easy to understand,This is a great book to teach fractions. It's so easy to follow. Lots of examples for kids to follow and little stories throughout to understand what each type of fraction means. Well worth it.
3,Overpriced and not honest enough,"No book can fully relate what it is like to become a teacher. Do you want to know what teaching's really like? Sit in for a week at a school, preferably the kind of school that beginning teachers usually get their start in (read: poor ones). Observe the classes. Talk to the teachers. Talk to the administrators. Talk to the kids. Tell them to be honest with you. One week of that will tell you more about teaching and education today than this book."
4,JDOG RIPS IT UP ONCE AGAIN YA'LL,"JDOG DOES ONCE AGAIN, BUT WHAT DO YA EXPECT FROM THE PLAYA FROM SC? HE LAYS DOWN SOME TIGHT TRACKS WITH HELP FROM HIS PARTNER. THE CUT WITH BROTHA LYNCH AND DOCTOR IS SLAMMIN, PLUS NOBODY CAN TOUCH HIS FLOWIN TECHNIQUES..I WONDER WHERE HE GOT EM FROM. FOUR STARS BABY!"
1,hmmmm....,Street sk8er is really bad. DO you want to experience realistic street skateboarding? GO skate! This game is not the thing to turn to. The next best thing has to be Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Don't buy this game. Please.
4,"Complete sonata edition invaluable, but not quite complete","A set of the complete sonatas of Schubert is an essential book in the library of the music lover, as are most of the items in the Dover music catalogue. For a reasonable price, it compiles all the complete sonatas Schubert wrote. One only wishes Dover would have included the many fragments and single movements that Schubert left incomplete - some, like the C Major ""Reliquie"" provide much entertainment and insight."
5,A Little Light Music,"Aha! A Hanukkah CD that's fresh, eclectic, and not too folksy-sappy. This is an enchanting, original combination of music styles to enhance the Festival of Light. In particular, ""La Mujer de Terah,"" a Sephardic selection, was astoundingly beautiful. My only regret is that some of the songs don't have a more obvious connection to Hanukkah."
4,Pretty & Petite,"I bought these as a gift for my mother who can only wear nickel-free jewelry, and she loves them. I was worried that they may be cheap looking, but I actually wore them when I visted her, and I really like them. They're smaller earings, but they're very pretty & stylish."
1,Yeah! Where the hell is it?,It's nearly April and my order hasn't even been shipped! It's been weeks since I ordered it. I'm going to rely on the Baseball America Prospect Handbook from now on.
1,All Remakes,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes, well done, but nonetheless, remakes."
4,Charley Pride - 24 Greatest Hits,A very good country artist with a baritone voice. I think you will enjoy Charlie Pride's unique singing capabilities.
2,"OK, but not recommended.","This book is the sequel to Welcome To Temptation, which was about Sophie and Phin. Davy had a smaller role in that book and now this book is about him. The plot didn't make sense to me. Someone paints pictures and signs them with a fake name in the way someone uses a ""pen name"" to write books. The painter in this story felt she might go to jail if anyone found out. That didn't make sense to me since the name she signed wasn't a name used by anyone else. Davy is a reformed con man who meets the painter and more events happen. I didn't enjoy the plot or the characters that much. Nothing surprised or delighted me. Only once did I chuckle at something humorous. I read this because I loved three other books by this author which are ""Bet Me,' ""Welcome To Temptation"" and ""Anyone But You."" I do not recommend ""Faking It."" Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2002. Genre: contemporary romance."
4,Fun poolside reading!,"Took this book while sunbathing and wasn't a bit surprised how quickly I finished it. Yes, it was that entertaining."
1,Just Awful...,I like this author but this book wasn't up to par. There were too many characters and J.C. tried to make each one more weird than the next. It was terrible.
1,Crashed and Burned,"This author is usually very good but this book, which I so looked forward to reading, was awful. Davy's sex appeal and wit came through early on but fizzled fast. His relationship with Tilda was boring, as was the entire story.As for the secondary characters; there were WAY too many of them. I will say they started out to be fairly interesting, but I became very annoyed very fast with their strangeness and ""different"" outlook on life. Rather than let the reader accept these people for who they were, with all their quirks, the author must have thought she needed to push the envelope and make them weird so we'd notice them. It wasn't necessary; they were fine as they were.I especially didn't like how Davy's friend showed up at the door as an elegant, classy and even mysterious man, only to land in the sack with Tilda's sister literally within seconds of meeting her. He ended up being just another base character without intrigue."
4,BUY IT NOW!!!!!,"FAKING IT is back to the WELCOME TO TEMPTATION tradition of humor, crime, and a little romance. I loved this one. It was fun, it was sweet and sour, (not as spicey as WWT). The humor was dark, maybe even twisted at times, which you'd expect from those Dempsey morals. The characters were neurotic (consider a household comprised of one forger, two conmen, one thief, one hitman, one depressed painter with a psycho cat, a sister with a [cheap] alter ego, her gay ex-husband and his absolutely normal, sane, and down-to earth partner, their daughter who keeps trying to date her career, and a matriarchal figure obsessed with double-crostics and a thing for tiny umbrellas). The plot was interesting and fun, think Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole in HOW TO STEAL A MILLION. For all you WTT fans, Clea is back, and Davy Dempsey is soooo sexy! He can deal 3 Card Monte at my table any time!"
1,Waste of Money & Time,"This book is a tribute (ironic title) to all the people who enjoy really bad writing- silly plot, unbelievable sexual chemistry, and incredibly awful descriptions (ie., first the dog is picked up, then dropped, then on her lap....on & on) YUK!"
4,"Charming characters, lively plot","Although it took a while to get ""in"" to this book, persistence was well worth it. The characters are quirky and original and the plot moves quickly. If you are looking for a serious book, don't read this. It is a light-hearted, amusing romance - great reading for a weekend away from it all. (While I was reading this book, my boyfriend observed ""you keep laughing to yourself while you're reading that - what on earth is it?"")"
1,Someone break her knuckles before she writes again!,"This was possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. A pedantic, self-absorbed writing style and a totally unsympathetic cast of characters. I'm sorry, but I don't want to read about characters I don't care about or wish would just get a life. And the writing can be described in one word: UGH. ""She went over to the pumpkin with the knife and cut holes in the orange fruit."" GASP! A pumpkin is ORANGE? I never would have figured that out! ""He followed his legs to the window."" Are you suggesting there is some other way to do this? Stop thumping the thesaurus and just write in plain, unadorned English. Please. If you really like the beauty of the English language, avoid this book. If you like great characters, avoid this book. Heck, just avoid this book. I wanted to give this book less than one star, but that rating isn't available."
3,could not get into this,I just could not get into this.I don't know what it was./Mallory was too tough or what but it just did not keep my interest.
3,Intense Story,I rated this 3 stars because the story grabbed my attention from the start and held it throughout the book. The main character was well developed and I look forward to reading the rest of the books featuring Mallory. The character has deep scars that are revealed in the book but there is much more to be discovered.
2,Didn't grab me.,"I bought a later book in this seres (Crime School) so I decided to start from the beginning by reading the book that started it all.I had to ""make myself"" read this book. I have to agree with the other reveiwers that didn't like the main character. There is nothing to like about her. She's unaproachable and several times you are told she ""smirks"" or ""smiles"" but it isn't meant in a friendly manner. The other characters are just ""ok"" and the plot is a little on the boring side in that the action doesn't move quickly.This being the first book in the series, I'm not ready to give up on Mallory yet. I'll read the rest with that hopes that this first one is just the warm up and the characters will grow with each book. The only positive thing about being dissapointed in this is that there is a lot of room for improvement and I look forward to seeing in the books to come."
5,Excellent value,"These are not the extended life oil filters that go 10,000 miles. Those would be Fram XG16 oil filters. The PH16 is a 3-6,000 mile filterBe sure to use extended life oil with longer life oil filters like Mobile-1 synthetic.The filter arrived in good shape the black bottom is 'gripping' that helps one tighten the filter in place even when hands are oily.The price is comparable to the brick and mortar stores and delivered free with amazonPRIME."
2,"Lauren 30"" steel string acoustic guitar pckage","This item was much too small for the young lady for whom it was purchased as a Christmas gift. I am sure it would be a great item for a child 8 years or younger, but just did not work for petite 14-year-old. We returned this for a full-size item. The SERVICE was GREAT!"
4,great Child Guitar,My 9 year old bought this guitar with her christmas money last year. She has been taking lessons for 9 months now and it has been a wonderful guitar. One review said you get what you pay for and I feel we have gotten decent instrument that has recieved a few nicks and scrapes as she learns to care for her instrument. In a a year or two we will replace it with a larger size and a step up in quality. I highly reccommend this guitar for a child/ family that is new to music. Great value for a child instrument.
2,A litttle Spanish as well,"The layout of this book is great-the pictures come from the English language ""My First ____ Board"" Book series.However, pages 36-37, 40-41, 44-45, and 48 of my book are completely in Spanish. Had I not taken both French and Spanish the difference might have escaped me. I assume that people buying this book for their children are going to notice the problem--just thought it was worth a mention. ..."
3,Interesting yet forced,"The back of thins book made it sound much better than it turned out to be. I was expecting more from the same author of The Goblin Wood. There were many parts that were confusing, forced, and a little to much like other books...Star Wars in particular. Overall, the confusion and cliches were disappointing and hard to get through."
1,Fan doesn't last long enough to out way the cost,I purchased 2 of these fans a year ago thinking they would last longer than the cheaper fans. (I didn't buy them through Amazon.) Boy was I wrong. Both fans stopped working within 1 month of each other. The motors turn on but the blades do not move. What a waist of good money.
5,This book deserves more than 5 stars!,"This book is so amazing I can hardly describe it! It will help any person who has trouble in math see things in a whole new light. Not only is it excellent for kids, it is a great help for adults as well. In the beginning of the book there is a fascinating test to see whether you are right- or left-brained. It is so interesting to see how you score. I recommend this book to people of all ages, whether they are good in math or not."
4,Really down to earth and enjoyable read,"This book doesn't tell you what to wear. It tells you what not to wear and gives you the confidence to realize what you should be wearing. I expected a clear cut, ""if your body is this shape, this size and you're this height you look good in, such and such and such and such"" but no, it just gives you ideas not specific wardrobe assignments. And yes, what you wear CAN change your life, for the good or for the bad don't forget it goes both ways."
3,What about me?,"I bought the book because like other readers, I saw these women on Oprah and loved the transformations. However, the book offers some quick solutions which are fine if you have one flaw. But most of us see ourselves as having more than one imperfection in an area (i.e. small breasted, back fat, need a full-body smoother). And what average woman has closet shelves like those? I am substantially older than these two women and perhaps that affects my opinions but I think the color combinations they espouse are garish and the costume jewelry is cheap looking.That said, I found the book fun to read even though I couldn't relate to much of what they said. Still, I would love to see what miracle they could perform on this 64 year old!"
4,No black?? Huh?,"I bought this book mainly for the color combination charts, which is really interesting. I play it safe, so pairing aqua with yellow is not something I would think of on my own, yet willing to try to spruce up my wardrobe. However....the authors say that only black goes with black, although you may wear it with white, gray and chocolate. Never, they say, wear pink, red, yellow (or any other color) with black. What????!!!! They're plainly wrong on this one."
2,Not up to expectations,"I am a huge fan of WNTW and I am really dissapointed in this book. Trinny and Susannah are the only models and the advice isn't very realistic. The only thing that makes this (maybe) worth the money is the color chapter which shows which colors go with which.I was slightly offended by the constant knocking of black and wearing black with color. Who doesn't? Maybe in England they don't.If you want help matching things (but not with black) buy this. If not, try Stacy London and Clinton Kelly's book or the Lucky fashion manual. Much more helpful tips and useful info."
3,Computer Speaker Philips SBP1100/37,"At first i thought the speakers were useless because they didn't sound good at all, but i have plugged these into my IPod and they are wonderful. They sound loud and clear and they are so small (which is cute) so they do not take up space on my desk. Worth the buy."
4,Neat little speaker,"Before I bought it I kept on looking at the label for what the speaker uses as a power source.I could not find one.After opening it, I was amazed to find out that it does not require any batteries nor any power input at all, for a very good quality sound this size.I would definitely recommend this to others."
1,Pieces of crap that are worse than headphones!,It would be better to turn headphones sideways and turn them all the way up than to try and use these.
2,not impressed,I'm sorry to say that I was not impressed. Dealt alot with HO. (I searhed for O guage ). I learned more from reading magazines that reading this book. Seemed alittle out of date too.
4,Web-slinger come to life,"The long awaited arrival of the webslinger on the big screen. Peter David does a magnificent job spinning the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman. The minor changes from the comic book do not affect the story much, since the major events are told as the comic book portrays them. Definitely worth the wait."
1,broken crackers,"I have had these crackers from a cheese shop and they are wonderful. My order came in a box that was so torn up that someone had used very wide tape to keep it together. The inside individual boxes were ""smushed"" so that many had the plastic packages that actually held the crackers POPPED. So 4 boxes contained stale crackers. Keep in mind all the crackers were broken in small bits. I had by accident had the crackers shipped to my husbands old business address and the new owner accepted the package since he did not know the contents would be in such poor shape."
2,Tamp isn't the best fit for my KRUPS,"I ordered this tamp after verifying that it was the correct tamp for my KRUPs model espresso machine on the KRUPS website. I find it strange that the tamp isn't quite big enough for the fill basket, and the scoop doesn't fill the basket with enough grind, making a watery shot. So, I think KRUPS makes this tamp and scoop to accommodate several of their models, causing it to fit poorly on all of them. I am able to use it on my machine, but I would expect it to actually fit for the price. I'm also disappointed that it is made of plastic."
5,Well worth the money,"This vacuum is pricey but soooo worth the money. If you have long haired pets, kids constantly in and out, this is the best vacuum out there. It picks up pet hair like nobody's business, never clogs and you can empty the dirty canister without ever having to touch the dirt. I was hesitant to spend so much on a vacuum but nothing else ever worked well enough. After much debating, I bought this and will never buy another brand again."
1,"Very, very cheap","I had this dresser for about 6-months before it fell apart. The screws that hold the tracks into the pressed-board sides are short and fall out easily. To top it off, the wood ""material"" is cheaply produced and crumbles easily, making it utterly impossible to put in new screws if the originals fall out. I can't use two of the draws any longer, after repairing the sliders a number of times and the wood just falling apart. It's cheap because the product itself is cheap. Don't buy it if you plan to use it."
3,its allright,this item looks well but i dont know how the tires will hold up. also the front caster lock does not work as well as i would like it to. a little light duty.
2,So-so,"There's a lot in the package and it's cheap... They work - sort of... The manufacturing tolerance is off, the clips don't 100% fit into the RJ45 / Cat5E port, causing the clip to slip back out. Not the best stuff, but it works if you don't have any tension pulling back on the wire..."
3,Get's the job done,These are just normal RJ-45's nothing special and they get the job done. I have used a lot of them and they work just fine. Not sure if I would buy them if they were for a corporate environment but I have no reason for that assumption. I have not had any issues with these and crimp just fine.
1,Don't lock in,These connectors do not lock in the jack properly.. See other reviews.. The waste of time is more important than the waste of money!!
1,These don't click into port,"Yes, I crimped them correctly...lots of experience. The wire stays tight into the connector but the connector will not click into a switch or router port. Tried multiple devices and multiples connectors in the bag. They seem to work and transmit data OK, but come out of the port easily. Buy a different brand!"
2,It's ok.,"I made several patch cables using these connectors. The pin connections are good without any problems.The plastic clip that clicks the connector in place might not be of optimal size though. I tried to connect the newly made patch cable to my PS3 but couldn't ""click"" it until I changed the connector to another brand.I realize for the same price I could only get like 10 connectors from my local store but if they don't fit, it doesn't matter if I got 100."
3,This is not the original.,"To the review before mine, this is not the original care bears because beastly was not in the original. I am 21 and can remember the very original cartoon in the early 80s, and that is the one I know and love. I gave this one three stars because it is also good, but it is not the original, and nothing is as good as the original. Todays generation should get a chance to experience care bears through the original cartoons the way they were meant to be enjoyed, but this is only my opinion."
4,A good kluski noodle,"Of course these noodles aren't as good as the authentic, fresh Amish noodle I could get in Pennsylvania, but they're as good as any packaged kluski noodle I've had. I've been in a kluski noodle drought since moving to Arizona, so it was great to find them at Amazon."
4,Good Tasting Noodles,"Nice, thick eggy noodles. They ALMOST taste homemade. They have a nice chew to them if you cook them properly. Since they are an Amish product they are a bit breakable and you do end up with a bunch of little pieces at the bottom of the bag but they are so good I don't care."
3,good find!,"This bar was more heavily padded than I'm used to, I didnt like that too much, but I did finally get used to it. it works fine and is a good deal price wise, Its hard to find a 6lb so.. I was thrilled to find this one, a good buy!!also, if you havent done body bar before, 6lbs might not seem like much but trust me for some of the things you'll be doing, 6lbs is a LOT. for a beginner or just on those days you really want a light workout (for those who use the really heavier bars and have worked up to a higher lvl) this is a good weight!"
3,Too basic,"This book is for someone who is clueless about music theory. I was attracted by the title since I was looking for good notation reading techniques, meaning how to practice sight reading, how to apply sight rading to your instrument or voice, but this book addresses none of that. I do recognize and congratulate the author for the ease of reading, and it even clarified a theory doubt for me.I would recommend this book to a begginer notation reader, but I personally felt very dissapointed for not finding advanced material on how to read, as the title suggests."
3,The Two Towers Visual Companion,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Visual Companion is the second in the series and features full-page, full color photos, drawings and illustrations from the upcoming movie release, a well as a foreword by Viggo Mortensen, a.k.a. Aragorn. Familiar characters are show and discussed, such as Gollum and Treebeard, not to mention the wonderful foldout battle plan of the climactic events at Helm's Deep. There is also a brand new map of Rohan and Gondor, specially commissioned, as well as a selection of large-format shots of Middle-earth. It is the perfect item to be acquire to gear up one's excitement just before the movie release.Originally published on December 9th, 2002.Go to BookBanter [...] for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
3,another vince mistake,"i dont know what they were thinking, when will they learn. a match is a match from ENTRANCE to finish, this mst be included in all dvd's and compilations. this is just a way to make a quick wallmart dolla, listen if you really want the full effect of taker in wwf-wwe watch from the start all the original tapes and wrestlemania's that is true class, trust me ive been a fan for 18 years. its a good gift if ur a new fan, but for a seasoned fan, its a let down as usual, if you want a great dvd butshawn michaels heartbreak and triumph, a great dvd compilation"
2,Piece of garbage,"I bought two of these lamps a few years ago, and they were nice until they fell apart. Both of the shades separated from the part that attaches to the lamp base. I would love to find replacement shades, as the bases are still intact, but I have not been able to do so. They look nice, but apparently they are not made very well."
2,Not as described,"The lamp shade arrived broken. It is definitely not made completely of glass. The piece that was broken seemed to be plastic or some other material. But not glass. The sections are connected with a black non smooth substance. One place where two sides met there was a gap between the pieces. The bottom was not a brown oak. It looked like it was stained an orange color. The seller offered to just mail another shade. But I didn't like the looks of it at all. Maybe they have changed the lamp since the description and picture were posted. So, the lamp was OK if you like the color and the way it was put together. The design was pretty."
5,MELVINS GOING FOR SOMETHING REALLY MAGICAL,"Some of the reviews for this cd are on the negative side and I just can't understand that. What can I say? I suppose you're not true Melvins fans. I love every track on this cd. I agree it's one of the most far-fetched albums The Melvins have recorded, but The Melvins have been a far-fetched band from the get go. If you enjoy listening to this band at all, pick this one up, it has everything, darkness, simplicity, soft, heavy and even folk. King Buzzo is on top of his writing efforts with songs like The Bit, Bar-X-The Rocking M, Tipping The Lion, and Captain Pungent. It is definitely one of my favorite offerings by The Melvins...Enjoy!"
2,not intended for heavy use,I ordered this screen and ended up sending it back. I think it would work OK for occasional use but for frequent use I am pretty sure it would not last very long.
5,Help?? How different is the 7th edition?,I am required to buy the 7th edition for my History class and am wondering if these earlier editions would be close to the same thing. I could save a lot of money by buying an earlier edition!!
1,Too Biased...,I've never read a more slanted view of American history. It makes absolutely no attempt to remain neutral.
4,solid,"A good readlot they will give you pause about how you are lucky your life, and how to love it more fully"
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately this image is pretty terrible. It's not a real photo print, and just looks cheap and crappy. You'd be better off pausing your DVD at the correct moment and taking a picture of it, which is likely what they did for this image."
5,Trading Christmas,"I purchased it because I like Tom Cavanagh...but fell in love with Gil Bellows character, and Gil Bellows! It's after Christmas and I still like watching it. Sweet movie...makes me feel good every time I watch it."
5,a+,"Jules Verne In Search of the Castaways another great classic,Jules Verne is my favorite author,I hope to read all his books English translation"
3,Lion's Mane,"Definitely not my favorite Sherlock Holmes Book, but none-the-less quite good. Sherlock Holmes' power of observation and rationality are awe-inspiring. In this story he also reveals a love of books and how he things he has read come back to him in a somewhat chaotic fashion. (foreshadowing semantic networks? )"
5,Excellent book,Excellent book on leadership. The author discusses the differences between a good leader and an effective leader. I highly recommend this book for any individual looking to become a better leader.
1,"A -5 book. Too large, almost 700 pages! Exam cram????","This is a study guide, and a poor one at that. Hard to find the exam objectives, and the text is too poorly written to understand it. Stopped counting the errors after the first few chapters. Wait for another CLSC book to come out. I have never seen an exam cram book this poorly written or so large before. It would take forever to read all of this book."
2,Written in that other language - Microese,"I got Front Page at a discount (quote unquote) - no expensive packaging AND no booklet. I have some experience with the programming world but was lost and knew I needed help. This was the first (and worst) place to turn. Like another reviewer, my wife thought this was just what I wanted...and at first I did too. But the presentation was jumpy and worse, it seemed as if the author were addressing a room of Microsoft business folks. Many of the explanations were of the obvious, particularly the review of all the menus. Why not put these in an appendix for later perusal? I was not looking for the dumbed-down Idiots series but I did need something that this did not fulfill. After much searching I found just the one and now am ready to go ""on line"" with my new site."
1,THE DREAMSTONE.......MAKES THIS BOOK A NIGHTMARE,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. BUT IF YOU ALREADY FELL INTO THIS TRAP, DON'T GO FORWARD!"
5,Cheap and effective,"Quick notice: The box itself actually doubles as the frame for the scratching pad so try not to mutilate it when ""opening"" the item. Anyway, the scratcher was positevly stuffed with cat nip, enough to saturate both sides of pad with excess, needless to say my cat gets a kick out of it. Considering how cheap this item is compared with ones you'd find in an actual pet store, the sctratching pad holds up very well. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,Could be a coffee table book,"The images in this book are very moving and the stories are poignant. But the reader is left to wonder-- is it really in the children's best interest to have their stories and images laid out in a coffee table book? Children do not understand informed consent and the use of their images, which are treated for the most part sensitively, so one is left considering the question, how or were their rights addressed in using their artwork in this way? I think this book is worth the purchase, I am, however, wondering what the authors' agenda was in getting it published."
5,Still good stuff!!!,"I received the book through Amazon's Marketplace, at a reduced price. The sender the very courteous and the book was sent in a timely manner and in very good shape. Thanks Larry! I've already glanced through the book and, wow!....I'm impresssed with the content. I'm looking forward to sharing those questions with my new-found friend. Yes, I'm liking him in that way :).Thanks Amazon...and thanks again Larry. Kudos to you.Camilla"
4,nice lamp,Very nice lamp. It works very well and is stable on the table. Does not cast much light upward. The base appears much lighter in color in the photos
3,Playfull traditon,"In true Persian musical tradition, this trio lifts the idea of improvisation to new heights and opens doors that at times seems taboo. None the less, it is their technical mastery that overcomes less than well grounded forays in mixing so many divergent ideas of rhythms and ""voices"". In fact there are too many ""voices"", for a lack of a better word, which compete for carrying each piece.At the end, it is nice to hear these ""jazz"" inspired efforts, but one is left a bit wanting for the delight of unexplainable contradiction of free but bounded impovisations demaded by Persian musical tradition.This is definitely an excellent light background music for new comers who can't really handle the sublties of true tombak music."
5,Excellent book - wish it was still in print!,"My parents bought me this book when I was 9 years old. More than 25 years later, I have kept it, taken great care of it, and brought it with me through numerous moves and incarnations of my life. This book has GREAT information - it's a shame that it is out of print.I used this book as a reference for 'how does?' or ""why does...?"" for many years. I am excited that I'm going to get to let my children read my copy when they get older, as it deals with all sorts of science categories, including human anatomy and reproduction, in a sensitive and appropriate manner for children to read. It made sense to me when I was a child reading this book, and the concepts I learned from thumbing through its pages set the stage for successful science learning during the entirety of my school career."
3,Just okay,"I admit, I've never used one of these pin pullers before, until now. Coming from an aviation background in the military, I've seen plastic versions of tools like this, and I realize there are individual pins inside connectors but didn't give it much thought on the different types of catch mechanisms inside. Trying to find the correct tool for the right sized pin is key. That's why I bought two different types of terminal tools. When I first tried to remove a stuck pin in a connector for my 69 Mustang, I used the larger hollow side that fit. Because the pin was stuck I had to move the tool around quite a bit and when I applied a little too much force, the tube buckled. I was disappointed in the quality and how quickly it buckled but I guess that's what I get for being a knuckle dragging jet engine mech. I suppose if I had cute little avionicsman fingers, I would have realized I needed another version of this tool to use. Luckily I bought two of these because the other tool worked great."
2,Would have been much more beneficial and enjoyable if the text had been retyped.,The text as it was photocopied from the original is rather hard to read. It would have been much more beneficial and enjoyable if the text had been retyped rather than just photocopied. The cover and the book itself are appealing but of course the content is the most important part.
4,It's Extravaganza Realness,"This Season is Hilliarious , Dramatic , serving Uniquness Nerve and Talent Realness . I have all the Seasons and theres never a dull moment ."
4,let's get something straight,"Whoever said Shannon is like a ""female version of Smog"" is wrong. They have toured together, and share the same DIY approach to music (playing all the instruments yourself), but that's where the similarities end. Live, Shannon is absolutely in a rage, all a blur of flying red hair, and occasionally, a writhing mass on the floor, still wailing away on her guitar. Bill Callahan, on the other hand, is very reserved. You can't tell what Shannon is saying in her songs, and her lyrics are nonsensical, wheras when you hear Smog, the words are easy to hear and his writing is very simple and you know exactly what he is trying to put across with his words. Both are very nice to their fans though. I highly recommend seeing Shannon live. Get right up front."
5,Very helpful and extremely funny!,"My ex-girlfriend has a copy of this book. I enjoyed it so much when we used it to work on her Bug that I want one for myself, and I don't even have a Volkswagon..."
5,"If the band were any tighter, it'd snap!","Just have to join the rave reviews for Lloyd Jones' Love Gotcha. This is the real thing, from the vocals through the rhythm section and out through the horns. Memphis Blues with Oakland punch.Thanks to CD Now's sample cuts you can check out the title track and see for yourself."
1,cheap cage not worth the money,I purchased this cage and found it to be too flimsy for my new pet rat. The bars are weak and the cage door can easily be pushed open.Also the water bottle did not work and the other items struck me as cheap. Do yourself a favor and go to Quality Cages or Martins and forget trying to save 20 bucks.Wasn't worth it.I gave it one star b/c it might work for mice.......maybe.
4,Blue Meanies Big Label Debut,"The Blue Meanies finally signed to a big label which had many of their fans thinking it was the big sellout. I wouldn't say they have sold out but they are much more 'polished'. The Post Wave is a decent album for the Blue Meanies. This is pretty impressive considering a crappy album by them is still worlds better than a 'decent' release by most of today's artists. Their sound is much more polished and user friendly this time around. It may come as a suprise to those who remember the classic Blue Meanies raw, rough sound. The Post Wave does not have the same edge as past releases but their sense of humor and political awareness is still there. The music still sounds like a punk circus but just a more friendly version."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I read this book just recently and have found it to be lacking in just about every respect. Not only does leave the single man standing out in the cold, it demands a measure of righteousness that may be unatainable. If you read this book, please keep in mind that man is not justified by himself. You cannot make yourself righteous, it requires Christ. This applies to all aspects of righteousness, to include sexual righteousness. I recommend that instead of this book someone read ""The Four Loves"" by C.S. Lewis, or one of his many essays dealing with love and sexual temptation(I don't have one infron to me, but as I recall ""The World's Last Night"" included a good one."
2,More psychological than spiritual,If you are looking for spiritual ways to fight sex addictions this book is not going to help you. It introduces merely psychological approach to the problem similar way as 'how to quit smoking fast' guide would do.
1,"If you are the woman in the relationship, don't waste your money. Unless you like guilt trips.",This book is completely off base. In this book the author ( a man) says it is the woman's responsibility to have sex with her husband every few days in order to keep his eyes from wandering. B.S. is what I have to say.
5,Great book,The book is a pretty easy read but it gave direct and complete answers to many questions i had about sexual temptation. Most importantly it provides practical tools for any man to use to get out of the rut and regain sexual purity. This is a must read.
4,"Should be called ""Every Married Man's Battle""",I appreciate the candid and straightforward talk about sexuality and purity from a Christian perspective. It is a vital yet missing part of everyday Christian conversations and media. I gleaned some important information from the book but as a single man I found the strategies of limited effect. I can't focus my sexual energies onto my non-existent wife or expect to have a godly 'nocturnal emission' every few days to 'release the pressure' as the book suggest. I am sure married men would get more out this book than I did but I still received some good information.
4,Great book!,"This book is not as good as the devotional. At times, I felt this book gets too wordy and could have gotten to the point a lot quicker. That said, it's still an excellent book for ALL men, not just Christian ones."
1,The Book Sterotypes Men As Brutes - Bad Book,"I read ""Every Woman's Battle"" first and it was full ofsterotypes,then I read this book.Bad idea!This book presentsmen as sexual brutes,barely able to view a woman as anymorethan a sex object.In the same way ""Every Women's Battle""portrays women as passive til a ""charmer"" comes along,this bookportrays men as natural aggressors,monsters and preditors.Has no valid information on how to controll desire andbasically states boys will be boys.Generalistic and sexist!"
3,Take what you can!,"I think this book has some real good techniques that will help anyone avoid sexual temptation, but it does have it's shortcomings. The author's don't seem to be very well trained in human psychology so they are not taking into account what things like low self-esteem and other emotional problems may cause when it comes to sexual temptation.Also the authors blame lots of temptation on Satan. Personally I don't believe Satan is omnipresent, nor do I believe that Christian men all have demons following them around. So I think the authors are missing out on some key points somewhere about what really causes temptation.Overall I would highly recommend the book to anyone that has the slightest problem with sexual temptation in their lives."
2,Touches the surface,"This book just touches the surface about a walk with the Lord. That is all we really need is to enjoy the Lord and let him work in us. A book that I thought was more help full was ""Our Human Spirit"" by Witness Lee. Available at www.lsm.org"
5,Great,"Definitely worth the read. If any man is suffering lust please ... i encourage them to read this. I would personally buy this book for someone who is suffering lustful thoughts and have hard time with porn and looking at women. I had this same problem. Im taking the test and doing it cold turkey. Think about God and pray under your breath if the temptation comes. Its saved my marriage, sex life and my future."
5,This book helped me to win the war against lust,"I have struggled with the issue of lust for over ten years. I have tried all kinds of prayers and paths that preachers have thrown out, but none have helped even a little. This book gave me the tools to dig myself out of the pit.This book is based on scriptural references and I have a developed a wonderful new perspective on them. This book is the tool I needed, but it is founded on God's wisdom, not man'sIf you're a male, then I strongly encourage you to consider this book. Break the bonds of lust and a mediocre spiritual live. Revive your relationship with God by eliminating the most common sin among men."
4,Essential for Singers and Scholars: Schubert's Song Cycles,"This is the Dover edition of Franz Schubert's two song cycles on the poetry of Wilhelm Mueller -- Die Schoene Muellerin and Die Winterreise -- plus the collection of songs known as Schwanengesang, which is not a true cycle but rather a group of songs written by Schubert near the end of his short life (d. 1828), packaged as cycle posthumously by his publisher. If you are interested in art song, this plus a few other volumes -- for instance Schubert's Goethe Lieder, also available from Dover -- are an essential aid to enjoyment and understanding. One down side is that this is the usual Dover repackaging of an older source, and as such lacks things such as measure numbers and Deutsch catalogue numbers that would be useful to have. For the money, however, this is an essential value. English translations of the poems are included in the back of the volume."
1,"Cut, edited DVD is missing several minutes of footage","The old Monterey VHS version is uncut, but this DVD version from Retromedia is missing quite a bit of footage. Avoid this one, especially as another company is due to release an uncut version on DVD in 2006."
3,Not up Rachels' other work,"In th interest of brevity, I'll simply say here that this record doesn't have the same appeal as ""Egon Schiele"" or ""Selenography."" Both songs on this disc dissolve into cacaphony, for which I have little patience, especially given Rachels' abilities to do so much more."
2,Lots of grammar,"Before criticizing the book its worth noting that Arabic poses several problems to the English speaker. Standard written Arabic is thicket of grammar that makes German look like a walk in the park. Spoken Arabic is a simpler affair but dialects vary from country to country. So teachers of Arabic have to decide whether to start with grammar (A&S;'s approach) or with conversation (Al Kitab's).I am using this book at NYU. I, along with my classmates and professor, complain about it's over emphasis on grammar, its typos and questionable organization. The strict grammar rules lend themselves to simple presentation in tables, but the authors generally fail to use this approach. Also note that you will need to buy the CDs. They are appallingly expensive given the poor production quality.If your goal is to read classic Arabic literature A&S; is probably your best bet. But if you want to be able to handle a basic conversation I recommend Al Kitab instead."
5,Ahlen was Sahlan,book was delivered as described but missing the all important CD (which was disclosed was missing). Good seller all around.
4,Requires cassettes!,"I ordered this book based on the reviews. It is well-written and easy to understand. However, the lessons require the use of cassettes that do not come with the book. The cassettes are available at Amazon for [price], much more than the price of the book. It's most likely intended for use in a classroom."
1,Worst blades ever,Had to put my old blades on streaked my windows. The blades where filthy. Emailed trico and they sent me anew set haven't tried them yet.
1,As good as the cheapest ones.,"Bought these based on the reviews of others..I was tired of buying the cheaper ones around $3-4 and thought these would be the greatest things since the tire was invented..Mine is 17"" long and streakes the bottom 6""..I cant get these things to clear the windshield..They are windshield wipers for pete's sake, how hard can it be to work? I've never had wipers leave so much of the windshield unclear."
2,Barlow!!! we need you!,"The remake is bad.....Owens sounds like hes trying to sing like Bruce Dickenson and it takes away the fury that Barlow had. Get Barlow back please!!!!! Oewns can sing, but I am tired of his weak effort. Iced Earth needs Barlow. I have listened to a long interview with Shaffer and he basically thinks that HE is all the band needs, he is grossly wrong. He even went as far as to make fun of bands like Manowar and Helloween. Bands that have been around much longer than him. Shame on him!"
4,And the point is?,"Via Google, I've seen VNV's lyrics turn up on (gah) white-power websites, and libertarian ones, and religious ones, and ones that simply respect the individual's prerogative to find his or her own way. ""Victory, Not Vengeance"" is the perfect encapsulation of their message. It can mean whatever we want it to mean: we wouldn't want vengeance, but at the same time, victory over what?That's both part of their gift and part of their curse. The lyrics are so drenched in Biblical and satirically-fascist allusions that I often find it difficult to get a real sense of what they're aiming at. I think I get it -- but so do interpreters whose societal goals are anathema to my own.Musically speaking, this is one of VNV's finest efforts to date, with ""Chrome,"" ""Endless Skies,"" and ""Arena"" standing out."
2,Disappointingly below average,"A couple of reasonable tracks with lots of filler material. There's very little that I'd either want to listen to at home, or bounce around to in a club. It's just.. not that danceable, not that catchy, not that melodic, not that moving, not that good. :("
2,I don't like where they are going with this one...,"Empires seems to have been the creative peak for VNV Nation. Futureperfect was not nearly as strong and less consistent, although it had many good tracks. Matter+Form throws any sense of consistency out the window and although there are some good tracks on here, not enough to keep this album afloat. Chrome and Homeward are good tracks that are more like what you might expect from VNV Nation, the rest go all over the place. Rock-style drums and pop-like rythyms seem to dominate the rest of the album and make for a less than enjoyable overall listening experience. It lacks a real direction and any coherence and is more of a thrown-together collection of tracks than an actual album. They may never make another Empires, but I certainly expect better than this from them."
3,Not what I expected,"Well Ive been a VNV Nation fan for years and when I found they had a new album out I bought it that day... Needless to say, It could have been better.. i agree with most of the other reviews and just want to warn people that would like to get the whole experiance of VNV Nation not to start with this album. I would start with Empires and go there. It is listenable totally and some songs will go on you but if I were to make a VNV compilation there might be one or two songs from this album as opposed to the five or six taken from other CD's theyve made. But I will keep listening and do support any new direction they are willing to take."
5,funny but hes a great watch dog all 14 lbs,great sign right size color in my windows everone thinks its cool but all still knock on the door they know puggyzz the watch dog
3,"Adequate, but not outstanding","Wilberforce is a monumental figure. Vaughan does a good job of portraying many of the qualities that made Wilberforce the moral giant that he was. However, I would have appreciated a more straightforward biography than a thematic approach based on Wilberforce's virtues and leadership skills."
3,Bunch of cliches,"Dozens of two page ""chapters"", basically trading maxims, cliches and rules and a small description of what and what not to do. Nothing special."
5,unique gift,my mother-in-law has been looking for this clock forever. I found it on amazon...of course! she loves it. each hour a realistic sound is played. it is very cool!
3,Animal Sounds Clock,"This was just okay,, it looks cheap,, so I hope my granddaughter really likes it, because it was very pricey for plastic!!!!"
2,Misses the mark,"As I started this book, I was pleased to see that the author complained to Bob Buford that all of his examples were of rich men, and that she was setting out to show how women who were not millionaires could change their lives. To my dismay, most of the women whose stories are recited here are wealthy, well-established, powerful, and at the top of their professions. How does a working woman with two kids, a mortgage, and a $30,000.00 a year job make mid-life changes? She won't find out in this book."
4,"Smooth ride, but don't last long enough.","I bought these replacement wheels for my son's ripstick. He said they gave him a nice, smooth ride. As a parent though, I wish these things were more durable. He's going through a new set of wheels every 2-3 weeks!!!"
4,Fun Excercise,"My son loves his Ripstik board. I wish the wheels were a little less expensive, but it's worth it to see him out there moving and playing constantly."
2,Short Lived,"The RipStik is a blast,however, these wheels wear out much fast than expected. I am going to try inline skate wheels that are the same size and see if I can find some that last longer."
2,Photoshop 6 for Dummies Disappoints,"I found this Dummies book disappointing. It just rehashes the older Dummies book for Photoshop 5 with additional writing by Barbara Obermeier and now includes only Windoze screen shots. I used to use this book in the PS 5 incarnation for my PS classes. I really liked its sense of humor and how it was targeted in a no nonsense way for beginners. I will be switching to Peachpit Press's Classroom in A Book, not as much fun but certainly not a retread such as this book. Deke, where are you?"
1,Plastic!,"If you consider this item for the metalic touch and feel, beware. The plate is made of ABS plastic.In the Atrio series, spout, shower arm, diverter trim, and levers are all beautilful satin nickel, but there are several parts on the thermostatic trim that are made of plastic, in particular, the main plate. And the plastic parts do not exactly match the satin nickel color.Needless to say I am a disappointed customer who paid a premium for Grohe as well as for the satin nickel look. I discovered this after contractor installed the thermostatic valve. So I called Grohe to see if I can get compatible metalic trim, and was told that the same components in the series are designed with plastic, and there is no metal option."
4,Make up hair protector.,I bought this for a friend who is in a nursing home it was exactly what she wanted and the right price. I did not even think they still made these.
1,A total bore,"This book is a waste of money. If you are curious enough to read it because of publicity about it, get it from the library. It is not worth purchasing. Really."
5,8 minutes and your done!,"This is a great DVD! I like all of the additional footage you get with it. My favorite is the abs and the stretching. My husband and I do the abs almost everyday.The only draw back is the dated wardrobe and music. It's not that big of an annoyance.I bought this for abs, I don't use the arms, legs or buns. I have watched all of the exercises, they look like good workouts. I lift weights but needed help with good ab exercises."
4,2 DVD set is a good buy,"I bought these looking for a workout I could do when there is no time to go to the gym. This DVD set is perfect and a great price. Unlike other ones I've tried the music is not annoying and you don't need any special equipment. The time left in each workout is always counting down in the corner of the screen so you stick with it, and after all it's only eight minutes. You do feel you accomplished something when you're done. I recommended it to a friend who agreed it was better than other videos we had tried."
3,Good Work Outs - Bad DVD layout,"The work outs on this DVD are great, but it is two-sided, so you constantly have to flip it over."
1,Basic and quick,I was looking for an exercise video with exercises targeted on the abs that didn't take a lot of time. This has really met my need. I can almost always fit 8 minutes into my schedule every day and it's not too boring. Instructions are clear and no equipment is required. The only drawback is that this is a double sided dvd and you have to eject and turn it over to do all 4 segments.
5,I never finished this movie....,"I watched this a few times, but never managed to finish it. The trouble is that I just can't get past that part in the middle where Ms. Lupino sings a few numbers in a smoky cocktail lounge...OH YEA!! It ALWAYS entrances me - that's why I haven't gotten to the rest yet! I'll finish it one day...but that part in the middle where she sings is worth the entire cost of the dvd alone!!"
1,What's all the fuss...,"This book and the response to it remind me of the Emperor's New Clothes. What a scam. I tried two recipes: spaghetti with tuna and marble cake. With tweaking, the spaghetti with tuna was fine/nothing special but the marble cake was a disaster that could not even be baked. There was obviously no test kitchen to check out the translations!Also, in looking over this book, it seems so incredibly dated. Why would anyone want to go back to 50's cooking!? I will stick with Marcella Hazan, Lorenza d'Medici, and other more recent authors of books on Italian cooking."
3,more damage than promised,The book was more damaged at the outside than announced in the description.I think that this was caused by the pour way of packaging.
2,"not ""new""","The book is awesome, but the break on the spine was pretty seveve for being described as ""new"""
5,Great Italian,Great Italian food! I really enjoyed a lot of the more traditional recipes found in the book. I recently got the book with another recipe book called Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher (a French author). Both books are filled with wonderful recipes and are highly recommended.
2,I waited two months for this book?,"Based on the fact that this book was a best seller, and had glowing reviews, I ordered it. After looking it over, I had it all packed up and ready to return to Amazon, but decided to keep it, as it would probably cost too much to return it. I can't tell you how much I dislike this book - from the mundane, ordinary recipes to the dreadful out-of-focus illustrations. The pictures are so unappetizing, it's hilarious! Some of the illustrations include a pile of sardines thrown haphazardly on a plate, and a bowl of what looks like Friskies Buffet. Many items are displayed on dirty, stained serving dishes. I can't even begin to describe the picture of the Black Risotto with Cuttlefish and the gruesome Partridge With Mustard. The only reason that I did not give this book one star is because it has given me so many laughs."
1,A lot of work for mediocre results,"I was pretty excited to get this book. It's beautiful and I love Italian cooking. Sadly, after making at least 15 different recipes and finding them all to be time-consuming, complicated, expensive disappointments, I have decided that this is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever owned. I traded it to a used book store for $5 in credit and was happy with the deal."
2,Boring,"I waited 2 months for this book to arrive. My initial reaction was one of disappointment. Nothing about this book caught my interest. I love Italian food and love to cook it. I decided I would probably keep it because of it's glowing reviews and I got it at a good price including free shipping. I kept going back to the book but could not get interested in it. It seemed simplistic and boring. It really did seem like the Italian version of Joy of Cooking. Seemed like a basic cookbook for the novice cook. I ended up returning the book at a local store. The store manager was shocked that I was returning it; told me it was the first book to come back. I have a slew of Italian cookbooks that I like better. Lydia Bastianich, Hazan Italian books to mention a couple. I will be curious to read other reviews on this book."
5,"If you love Italian food, look no further.","What a wonderful book. I've tried some of the receipes - they're delicious, authentic, and relatively simple to execute. Preparing these dishes made us nostalgic for our last Italian holiday!NOTE: This reviewer is the author of ""Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged."""
1,Sorry every time I use it.,"I have only used this massive collection of recipes a couple of times and each time I've wasted ingredients and time. For example, I attempted to make Caciotta Ravioli with tomato and basil. The recipe instructions start with the dough, which is supposed to be made from 3 1/2 cups of flour and 1/4 cup of oil. I'd love to see how this feat was accomplished by the authors of this cookbook! Granted, this review is for the 2005 version with the white cover, but sounds like the problem is still alive and well."
2,Not an Entire Loss,"A few years ago I had just purchased the ""On The Fast Track"" cd and I liked it so much I just had to have more work by Gerald. I went out to a store originally to buy his ""Love Letters"" cd, because I had already heard a few songs off that one. Well the store was out of it, so I grabbed ""Soul Control"" instead. My money probably could have been spent better some place else. There are 2 songs that I do like alot - ""Lady"" and ""Nobody Knows"". ""Lady is soft, but yet has a good beat. The late George Howard plays soprano sax on the song and the two artists accent one another well. ""Nobody Knows"" is even softer and more heavenly. It too features soprano sax. So it wasn't an entire loss I do play these 2 songs alot, the rest I can live without."
1,This book did not help my students,I am an 8th grade language arts teacher at Washington Junior High School and I just want to say that this book did not help my students in any way. There were countless grammatical errors and a lot of my 'A' students turned into 'F' students after I began using this book. i would NOT recommend this book for anyone who can read.
5,Great Example of Dark Underground Sound,"I own many Frankie Bones CDs, and this one is my favorite! And, one of the best put out by the New York DJ. There is no ""cheese"" on this disk. It is high quality ""dark acid tech."" The vinyl selection on this CD keeps true to that ""dirty underground"" sound that's so hard to find done right on disk. If more CDs had this kind of quality, fewer of us would have to take it upon ourselves learn how to spin tech. If you like the dark underground techno sound this is the CD for you!"
2,Wish it retained the eerieness,"I originally bought this cd for track 2 ""Kaleidoscope"". The song was a brilliant mix of piano, guitar, drumbeat and airy female voice. The dissonant sound of it is eerie and enchanting, and helps your mind to soar.However, the rest of the cd I only found mediocre. Never again throughout the remaining tracks was that certain dissonant sound to be captured again. Whether it was a fast track like ""Requiem"" or a slow one like ""Solstice"", I never felt as if the music was going anywhere - it just kind of goes on and on but never satisfies.Perhaps it is my own fault for expecting the cd to be dark and mysterious based on one track. Instead of ethereal I found it to be generic."
2,"Either you got it, or you didn't...","Well, I'm not going to say the book is bad, per se. From what I've gathered, it's like the Moulin Rouge of literature: either you got the inside joke and loved it, or you didn't and hated it. I fall into the latter. For someone weened on modern books and other reading materials, this is going to seem like a waste of tree pulp. Extrememly predictable, unrealistic (even for a sci-fi story), and chocked full of story info with little relevance to the actual story, it's a wonder the editor didn't laugh at Austin and threw him out of his office. Someone who lived in the early half of the 20th Century, it may bring back memories of the good old days. At best for me, it's a guilty pleasure book, though admittedly, it's a quick read. If you're looking for a meaty or thought-provoking story, _Second Contact_ is neither. Check it out of your local library first before dropping cold hard cash to buy it."
4,"An excellent , re-visit to Lankhmar!","If you have read and loved Lieber's work you will enjoy this. The most notable difference, of course, is the departure from the short story format to the FULL blown epic-saga style. I was quite apprehensive at first, but as I read on the story evolved! I extremely loved the return to the ""Slippery Eel"", with Robin's EXTRA details!"
3,Running On Empty,"No Respect was a classic. Davy Vain's In From Out of Nowhere was mature and in my opinion just as good as No Respect. On the Line leaves me with the filling Davy was just going through the motions. There is no emotion on this record and it just doesn't draw me in. It doesn't make me want to play it over and over like the preview two releases I mentioned. Maybe i'm just getting old. Davy, how about another CD like In From Out of Nowhere! With all that said, buy this CD. Support true pure rock bands like Vain! I just wish the CD was better."
3,Very Used,"Yes - this was a used library book - but it was described as in ""fair"" condition. That is not what I would call it! It is very fragile and not exactly toddler friendly. But after much taping I can still read it while my twin two year old grandkids ""hold"" it. The Georgie books are adorable story telling for toddlers and pre-schoolers."
3,cute for girl,"got these for my 10 1/2 year old daughter, they are cute but small. I think they are perfect for a girl, she likes to wear dangly earrings but her school wont allow it, these are small so they don't hang down far and she can wear them. Cute for girl, but not for adult."
1,The description of item is wrong!,I ordered this based on the size... 4 oz. I wanted something small. What I recieved in the mail is not 4 oz.. it's 12 oz. I can find plenty of 12 oz mesh shakers for 5.99 at World Market & other stores. I wanted a 4 oz shaker & was willing to pay & did pay a higher price to have a small shaker. I'm very disapointed that I got a large 12 oz. Item description is mis-leading.
4,"Great way to put yourself back in the game, Dave","This is the first CD that got me into Megadeth, though I do find most of their earlier stuff to be much better in a classic way. A few years back when I began listening to a little Metal, I enjoyed Metallica and never heard any Megadeth, mainly because I never knew about them and because Metallica was extremely hyped. I started with -The System Has Failed- in 2004 just for that ""latest approach"" feeling and figured it to be pretty good.Some of the songs became really redundant and kind of boring like ""Kick The Chair"", ""Something That I'm Not"", and ""Kingdom Come"", but don't get me wrong...there is much more to enjoy here than what was offered on -St.Aneurism-. Dave still probably chuckles a bit everytime -St. Anger- is even mentioned.IMO Standout Tracks:Die Dead EnoughTears In A VialI Know JackBack In The DayTruth Be ToldOf Mice And MenThe SECOND-HALF of Shadow Of Deth."
5,Hats off to Dave Mustaine!!!LONG LIVE MEGADETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Again...Dave Mustaine proves that he is the one and only person out there still creating metal.How St.Anger(an absolute piece of GARBAGE) made the charts and this slipped through the cracks I will never know.All I can say is that I hope Dave Mustaine never stops making records, because although his sales aren't as high, musically and creatively he runs circles around anything Metallica has put out in nearly 20 years.LONG LIVE MEGADETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LONG LIVE DAVE MUSTAINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RATTLE YOUR GOD DAMN HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Return To Form,"After TWNAH, I thought Megadeth would stay on that path, heavy but not pushing it. With TSHF, they return to Metal the way it was supposed to be played...FAST! If you don't believe me, listen to ""Blackmail the Universe"", ""Kick The Chair"", ""Back In The Day"" and you'll see that this is the best Megadeth album since Countdown To Extinction! Megadeth is back and ready to thrash!"
5,Simply their best since RIP and CTE,"Megadeth are back and they never sounded better. The dualing guitar solos by Dave Mustaine and original guitarist Chris Poland are just killer. Kick The Chair is an instant classic. Blackmail The Universe, Die Dead Enough, The Scorpion, and Truth Be Told are other good highlights as well. As for all you haters out there, if you don't like this album, tough luck. I really don't care what you think. Megadeth Rules, buy this album now."
4,Mustaine the metal factory,"This is a perfect example of how dynamic of a band Megadeth is. Dave Mustaine is the only ""real"" member of the band on this album with studio musicians filling in, and it still sounds like grade A metal perfection. It's not Megadeth's best and it does have a couple filler songs, but songs like ""Blackmail the Universe,"" and ""Kick The Chair,"" and ""Back in the Day"" are hard hitting favorites with stay power. ""Die Dead Enough,"" and ""Of Mice and Men"" among others are solid backing efforts.One of the best things about Megadeth is that all their albums have their own identity, even the albums that aren't the traditional Megadeth sound kick all sorts of tail. This album has a little bit of everything, a very solid offering."
2,Another false 2nd coming,"As with the album before this Mustaine claimed a 2nd coming of his earlier thrash sound, and just like with ""The World Needs a Hero"" he failed to deliver. I really wanted to give this three stars but I had to give it only two. There were a couple songs I really liked (Blackmail the Universe, The Scorpion) but I can't really make a convincing case for much else. ""Die Dead Enough"" has one of Mustaines worst choruses yet. ""Shadow of Deth"" starts with an awkwardly loud voice reciting a bible passage, and eventually a marginally acceptable instrumental part enters. ""Kick the Chair"" is a horrible recycling of riffs from ""Take No Prisoners"" along with an annoying chorus. ""Back In the Day"" and ""My Kingdom"" are bad nostalgic attempts of Dave trying to assert his validity as a metal musician. The upside is that Megadeth has a back catalog of amazing albums you can pillage before you get hard up enough to pick from this carcass."
1,Weak,"I used to like Megadeth, but this new ablum is as lame as the last two. The thing that really bothers me is I almost like it but the guitars are buried by the bass and drums and while the riffs are good they seem to lack the agression that made megadeth big in the first place. Maybe the "" dave mustain album"" will be good and he is just putting his filler material on this one. I have all of the megadeth albums right up to and including risk, but I think I will stop there."
2,"Boring,.,,","4 and a half star average customer rating are you freakin kidding me? Megadeth has got to be one of the softest and the weakest thrash metal bands that exists at the moment bar none. The only reason why Megadeth became popular is because Dave Mustaine used to be in Metallica. This album is in reality a real snoozefest in comparrison to hundreds of other metal bands out there that are blessing the scene today! Definitly avoid this album espicially if your looking for heavy thrash metal, if your looking for heavy thrash metal I suggest Kreator, Testament, Sodom, Destruction, Metal Church,Overkill, and Voivod. Leave this band be unless your looking for really soft metal solos that almost sounds like rock solos."
4,What are these other reviewers smokin?,"This album was a huge suprise to me as a long time 'deathfan. Its their best record since Rust in Peace. Firstly, I would like to say Dave is not missed on bass guitar on this record, the bass playing on this record is a far cry better than anything he has done (which 99% of the time was irrelevant in the past recordings).The bass can be felt, as well as heard on this record. All the guitar work is masterfully crafted, & the soloing is back with a vengance. In my opinion, the best in any Megadeth album to date. Dave Mustaine is back to singing like he cares on this record. This is a very well thought out, crafted record. It does however take a few listens to realize the scope of this record. Give it a chance to shine, and for sure it does."
4,"For those who want the short version, this will do nicely if you can find a copy...","I've read at least two full-length (around 300 pages) versions of the last two weeks of Booth's life, sometimes including the subsequent trial and execution of the other conspirators. A recent entry ""Manhunt"" is excellent. However, Mr. Steers' concise 70-page treatment is also fine, and will be enough for most people. There are some photos in this one I had not seen before as well. Booth's ""escape"" did not last many days, but each one must have been agonizing for him in terms of physical pain, cold, hunger, fear and anger when he discovered that even the defeated Confederacy by and large did not approve of his act of revenge. My copy of this book has a darker blue cover than the Amazon illustration and a copyright date of 1992, but the first edition apparently came out about ten years' earlier. Either way, it's a handy history."
5,Move over Harry Potter!!!!,I love Charlie Bone and this book did not disappoint me. I even think it may have been the best book in the series.
4,"Wonderful ""missing link"" from the Sound's early days","What a blast to finally be able to hear these early Sound recordings, given the usual loving treatment from Renascent. As with many early recordings from bands that had a decent run, these are somewhat rough and low-fi, even though Renascent surely did some remastering, to the extent possible. If you're a Sound fan, this is a must. If you are wondering who or what The Sound is, this is not the place to start. Try _From the Lion's Mouth_ or _Jeopardy_ (or better yet, both) for an introduction to the band. As with all Renascent releases, the all-cardboard package nicely re-creates the old vinyl feel, and the liner notes are fantastic."
5,Based On Adam Walsh,Gripping story of the Kidnapping and murder of a young boy. Worth watching. Need to put Part 2 on DVD.
1,Down Right DEGRADING,"I wouldn't exactly consider myself a blues purist, but I am definitely not foolish enough to believe that this CD is anythng even close to the blues. The tracks on this disc would have any self respecting blues lover turning green with sickness, not envy. The only three tracks on this disc that ARE blues are instrumentals. Which isn't a bad thing. But when the you hear the songs with lyrics you'll be praying that the end isnear. In short, Mike Welch sings with about as much emotion as the Spice Girls. AVOID THIS ALBUM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!"
4,Perfect combination,I bought this for my 5 year-old nephew who loves sharks and Pirates. He was pleased with the gift and has been playing with it since.
2,Doomsday with a twist.,"The writing style is fine, the plot.... full of holes.I would have liked to have read more about the events going on in the USA. INstead you follow a rat pack like of CIA preps around the middle east... They finally make it back to the USA, but after the ""40 minute nuclear exchange"" not much is left of this once great nation. This part of the book shines... and really pulls in - the aftermath.The ending has a nice twist... but not enough to pull the book up from the long uneventful first half of the story."
4,sweet soul music,"This is music for lovers of 70/80s soul music,the Dramatics have two lead vocalists who compliment each other,one a typical fallseto voice and the other in a more teddy P groove.Very few fillers,each track has a real voice and real instruments backing.Takes you back to when music actually ment something."
2,This is a bad cd!,"I just have something to say, i have always been a fan of Thalia, but this cd is her worst... She could do something a lot better... It just have 2 good songs and do not worth the price...If you really want to hear a good latin/pop music cd, you MUST buy the new Paulina Rubio cd, named as her ""Paulina"", all the songs are great, from start to end. This cd really worth the price but Thalia's..."
2,Decepcionante y Pobre CD,"Definitivamente un CD que no es el mejor de Thalia, una mezcla de ritmos que no van para nada con su personalidad, ademas de que su actitud con la prensa ayudo a que la comercializacion de este CD no fuera lo que se esperaba. Una Thalia donde no supera en nada a su anterior trabajo de AMOR A LA MEXICANA, incluye en este albums ritmos de rap donde dificilmente llega a ser creible que se ella quien lo interpreta...ademas su pose y tanta sangroneria esta por cansar a su publico que ya se siente una diosa y su falta de presentaciones en vivo esta deteriorando su imagen. Un album que definitivamente no arraso ni cuajo en el mercado, falto el toque que Thalia ha hecho en sus albums anteriores que era ser ella misma para pasar a hacer una cantante en busca de identidad que no tiene."
3,not a great re-release,"I am not rating the original album, but the re-release from 2005.The 3 bonus tracks do not make worth purchasing this CD since 2 of the ""remixes"" are already available on the album ""Thalia's Hits Remixed"" (2003) and the ""Arrasando (version banda)"" is simply taken from the album ""Con Banda: Grandes Exitos"" (2001). I was hoping to find in this CD the actual ""Version Banda"" of ""Arrasando"" that was released as a promotional single in 2001 for Mexican radio stations only. The mix is much better than the one found in the re-recorded Banda album from 2001. The ""Arrasando (version banda)"" single was used to test the potential success of Thalia's songs in Banda style in Mexico. Since the single was well received by the public, they decided to release the banda album. For the ones who do not care to buy the ""Remixed"" album, then this is a good choice to get the 2 remixes included (which are really good)."
1,A poor cousin to his first CD,"This is basically a boring CD. I have ""Pa'otro lado"" and loved it, it still mesmerises me; nearly every track on it is a winner, or at least catchy. I only wish I could say the same about ""De vuelta al barrio"". I think it should've been entitled ""Devuelveme al basurero"".The tracks on this CD lack the punchy beat of the first one. There is a smothering uniformity across the songs and they lack the distinctiveness that marked songs such as ""Limon con sal"" and ""Me enamore"" on the first CD. There is a ""sameness"" about this CD that is disappointing.I have trouble even listening to this CD, it is dull. Chichi, me encanto tu primer compacto. Vuelve al estudio para grabar otro compacto igualmente de bueno. Este nuevo pertenece en el basurero."
2,Lasts just a few months,"I bought this esprsso maker in January. I loved it at first. . . After a month all the decals wore off, so i had to memorize which side of the dial was brew and which was steam. At month three, the handle on the brew pot split in half. My husband was able to temporarily fix with gorilla glue. I took good care of my machine, I cleaned the steam shaft at least weekly according to the manufactures guidelines. I used soft water and I also delimed it also, according to manufactures directions. We'll this week, steam started coming out of the coffee insert and no coffee came out. When i went to remove it, the coffe griner handle snaped in two. So, I guess I had a good run - my machine managed to last SIX MONTHS! I guess it only averages a cost of $5 a month.I am looking for something a bit more durable."
3,Slow Brewed Cup of Joe,"Of all the cheap steam espresso makers I've had ECM20 probably makes the best cup of coffee although quite slowly.However, like all of this type of machines, it's meant to break. My 1st one lasted 2 years before the switch broke cause it's was old.Of course same thing happenned with Brauns & Krups. The new one already has a problem that's more irritant than problem. The rubber vacuum seal on the cap keeps falling out and has to be re-inserted almost every time I use the machine.That's why the overall rating is 3 to 31/2.Solid Cup of Joe but questionable quality. Can't anyone make a quality machine that will last for a reasonable price?"
4,Mr Coffee Cappuccino Machine - one slight flaw,"The machine works just fine now. The first time or two the steam escaped through the top. I believe this is due to the fact that it does not screw down straight and tight. I tried to adjust it as I put it on, but it continues to screw on slightly crooked. Overall though - it does the job!"
3,Arthritic hands?,Pay attention to the caution by another reviewer about difficulty turning knobs and caps. It's a problem.
3,not a bad little guy,"i think this is the exact same one that i had in germany but with a different brand name and slightly modified look. IF it is the same one...not bad for 40 bucks. if you pack it too tight with fine grain coffee it does get plugged and puts coffee out slowly or not at all; that is a limitation that you have to learn to deal with. maybe putting a filter at the bottom of the basket might help.for a first foray into expresso, go for it. i would never drop $500+ for an expresso machine and this one offers a good value.2/6/12 edit... i've actually decided to drop a few hundred for a used la pavoni machine. since i wrote this review i've bought a $100 pump delonghi machine which, while better than this one, isn't good at all. i've also been working at a coffee shop with commercial grade machines and know what is necessary for real coffee."
1,Cheap Chinese Crap,A real piece of Cheap Chinese Crap. Worked only 7 months - then the control knob broke off. This knob control both the power (on/off) and the steam valve (diverts steam to the latte steamer nozzle OR to the brewer). The plastic knob stem broke where it was attached to the steam valve - this should have been a metal part - not plastic. Another piece of landfill due to poor engineering. I suggest you avoid any Sunbeam (aka Mr. Coffee) products.
2,"Works great, but falls apart quickly!","First off, I LOVE this product, but will not purchase another! It was so easy to use! Within one month the plastic retainer on the filter broke and this past weekend (4 months old) the handle on the filter snapped right off. It was great, but I'm going to have to move on to a higher quality product."
4,Pays for itself,This product I've used in the past with great results. Better mileage and cost savings because stuff runs more efficiently and is less of a drain on the engine so it uses less gas.
3,Ok product,I used this on my sons new K&N filter that was installed on his R6. I guess it worked out ok. Not much else to say.
3,Need to Recharge the K&N,"K&N filters are far better than the standard paper filters and do last a lifetime, but they still need to be maintained. The cotton fibers do get dirty and the air flow and protective value of the filter goes down over time and they need to be cleaned and re oiled. This is the kit you need for that purpose."
4,Must have with your KN Air Filter,"You pretty much don't have a choice if you purchase a K&N; air filter...you have to have the recharger. The question is whether or not you want to purchase it along with your first-time purchase of the K&N; air filter.I just went ahead and purchased everything to take advantage of the free shipping. However, it's going to be quite some time before I actually have to use it (50,000 miles in some cases where conditions are great). So if you don't mind storing this stuff for later on, then get it now. Otherwise, I'd just wait till you actually need it.I went with the spray just for convenience. It seems easier and faster to apply compared to dropping the liquid in straight lines along all the ridges. However, it could be a bit messy if you're not careful."
3,Very Informative,"This book is no literary masterpiece and could use a good edit but it definitely should be read. Campbell uses a lifetime worth of professional experience to try and tabulate when world oil demand will exceed production. What's important here is not that this is happening now, 5 years from now or 20 years from now, but that this day will come and we are doing nothing to prepare for it. As long as no preparations are made, the shock will be just as severe no matter how far in the future it comes. A major thrust of the book is that oil is a finite resource and supplies cannot be indefinitely extended as prices rise. He states that yes, as prices rise, more oil can be recovered but the big problem occurs when demand cannot be satisfied. This is a matter of geology, not economics or politics."
5,Great value,"The astham friendly yellow lab is a great value. Soft and plush quality was excellent, and kids loved them!"
1,"Can you say the words, ""quit while your ahead of the game""",What is with this writer's books as of late. Maybe Ms. Ross should either find a new pen or quit while she has a little dignity left!
4,Good ole' country,"Despite the mass waves of female vocalists that are fleeting the country scene for mainstream, its great to see one stick to her guns. Terri Clark is as entertaining as ever in this new CD. If you're new to her, I truly think you'll enjoy it - and if you're not, you already know what to expect!"
1,Save your money,"verry cheeply made light weight ,Dans has some very nice things this is not one of them sorry,Dan Pennington"
5,great for breast cancer walk,This was great for the breast cancer walk. I put as a bandanna around my son's neck. It is the perfect accent to his outfit.
1,Was he There?,"It amazes me how hype can affect rational thought. A typical ""sell the sizzle, not the steak"" type book. Tell 'em what they want to hear- especially when they're down and out.Typical ""Fundie"" nonsense. Reminds me of Whoopi Goldberg playing the psychic in Ghost - ""who's Sam?"""
4,I enjoyed reading this book,"This is a pretty good book, but I would recommend Max Lucado's When Christ Comes over this book."
1,Boss PS-6 Super Shifter,"I returned this pedal after much frustration in trying to find useable tones. I bought it based on great internet reviews, but I found the pedal to be almost useless. I play Jackson guitars through a Maeshall JCM2000. The pedal has many dfferent settings i.e. 3rds 4ths 7ths, etc...The tones are very artificial sounding and sound very brittle almost like somebody hitting a steel drum behind the note you are playing...The only useful tone I found was the setting for 1 octave lower. The Digitech Whammy Harmonizer is only slightly better. A decent harmonizer is $500 plus."
3,"Why it Jeannie, Major Nelson & Major Healy in the South","Stereotypical representation of Southern folk in this episode for sure. Dumb hillbillies who don't knows what an astronaut is. After accidentally landing on a farm in south, mayhem and stupid comedy all based on the fact that the farmers don't know that there is a space program. Poor Jeannie is chased by one of them and accidentally hits her head on a rake or a hoe - you know the old gag from the time. She forgets who she is and can't blink them away from the folk. Very dumb, like most episodes of this show."
3,More of the same thing,"It is amazing that after 45 years, we even remember this show, let alone watch it. Do not get me wrong, I have seen this DVD and the shows are just good enough to be funny. But, think about it: this show had a single narrow premise: man finds genie and must conceal that fact from prying eyes of his boss. That's it.When we were young and saw this, we thought ""wow"", wouldn't that be cool. Nobody said, ""wait, was he making full use of this situation""? Like maybe ending the war, or doubling the world's fish stocks, or bringing rain to the desert? But, that wouldn't be comedy and, besides, the competition that the show was fighting(Bewitched) didn't do it either. In both cases, women who could change the flow of the Mississippi were doing housework because, their male leaders ordered them to. Wow, I guess we HAVE come a long way!"
5,So funny!,"Whenever I need a laugh, I pop in the I Dream of Jeannie DVD. My very favorite episode on this DVD is the one about the hillbillies in the country that encounter Major Nelson and Roger and mistake them for martians! It's so funny and comic; almost slapstick. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone. (Even my school aged son thinks they are funny). :)"
3,"Good for some, But not for all!!!","This is a half-way decent tool for the price, only if you plan to only use it for certain types of wires. This tool tends to always strip off to much strainded wire no matter what adjustments you make. On non-strainded wire of any gauge tool tends to cut into insulation with the locking jaw to hold in place and then it strips the wire leaving a very torn an jagged look. But if you can find the right wire to strip, then I guess it would be pretty good."
1,But any other carpet cleaner than Bissell,"The housing is cheap, underengineered plastic that has broken so many times that it can no longer be repaired. The cleaning solution bottle began leaking within a couple of months. If you have one of these that has broken, don't attempt to repair it yourself. It has a 2 year warranty that Bissell said was voided because I had to put a screw through the cover to allow me to finish cleaning up a mess.This unit was not designed for more than a 2 year life, less if used with any frequency."
2,Str8 wack,Yo this is straight played out copied generic reggae dub beats. You think this is original? You need to come original like 311 you know what I'm saying?
1,This guy ripped me off,"I am the original Jam Roc and I was might hurt when I saw this album. Check out my funky lyrics and see if you don't think I am FAR superior!Jam Roc loves to rockThe time to rock is two o'clockJam Roc!And...It is you who ought to leaveFaster than the falling leavesI will cut you then you'll leaveRip you like a maple leaf!Jam Roc!And...You are mine you are not oursWhen I'm with you I count the hoursLike a dog my ex-girl pantscause she still wants in my pants!Jam Roc!C'mon.. this guy owes me some bucks, a'ight?"
4,Very Good Album... and not because he is Bob's son,"Excellent album, I didn't know what to expect when I borrowed the album from my 14 years old stepson. I listened to a lot of Bob and alike and was happily surprised. It reminded me, on certain tracks, two albums I own, Wyclef Jean presents the Carnival and Tricky Blowback. Well produced, recommended with headphones..."
4,Pretty Good,This c.d. has a few really good tracks. The rest is just alright. I like Damian's hip hop flare and I think he should stay more towards that style.
5,"He's not Bob Marley, but still catchy!","I am in no way comparing Damian Marley to Bob Marley. Bob Marley is a legend, and I dont think anyone would ever be able to do what he did or even get close to the level that he was.Damian Marley's CD is excellent. Great songs that really get you in the mood to dance. There are also tracks like ""pimpa's paradise"" and, of course, ""welcome to jamrock"" which deal with very heavy issues. All in all, wonderful CD and definitely recommend it to anyone who loves reggae/dancehall music :)"
2,He is Aight,"got to hear this Album in full recently&It has some moments,but ""Welcome to Jam Rock"" was my cut.everything else after that I could take or leave.He has a street vibe to his Sound&got a chance to make it as a Hook Cat easily.His Father's Influence is felt throughout,but He ain't writing songs to match anywhere near the legacy of His Father yet,but time will tell where His Career ends up.right now He is Aight."
1,too much fat,"I had previously purchased the lamb flavor of this brand of treats. It was very good quality and my dogs love it, also it was not greasy or too high in fat. That is not the case for the chicken flavored treats from this company. Maybe it is a bad batch, but it is so oily I have to blot it with paper towel before letting my Papillon have any and even then it upset her stomach. The package says it has 10% fat but I think it is much higher and would not recommend the chicken flavor."
5,Deliciously superb!,"This is the best Thai cookery book I have ever come across. Colorful photos and easy to follow recipes. Having tried several of the recipes, I found them very authentic. Never, never, will I ever loan a cookery book to anybody on Earth! Especially THAI COOKING CLASS!! Please, I want my book back."
5,The Best FIF yet?,"Maybe. It is certainly their most mature album so far. The lyrics show the strongest Christian message of any of their albums(The Greatest Story Ever Told, World Without End). Musically, it is very fun and great skanking music at times.(The Phantom Mullet, Me Oh My) Keep on rocking for tha kids!"
3,Confused,"I was confused whan I bought this album. Five Iron Frenzy is my favorite band, but when I got it, I realized it was very different than the others. This has only been about 9 months since their last album, and I think they should have waited longer. The music seems to be less well written, and many of the songs without a real tune. I was really bummed. If you are new to Five Iron Frenzy, I think despite all these other reviews you should start out with their first album, upbeats and beatdowns when the ska was ska, and joyful and jumpy. You will like beautiful America."
1,Where has the energy gone to?,"What happened to FIF? Or should I rather say, why do all my favourite bands (Blink, Goldfinger, Millencolin, Lagwagon, RBF and now FIF)change to the worse. Why do they all turn slow as soon as they get kind of popular? I could never really agree with FIF lyrics, but the music, the energetic, awesome ska-punk sound I really loved, but this? Sorry, I find it just boring and some songs (like No.8) are just plain stupid. Oh, before I forget, this CD doesn't really deserve 1 star, I would actually give it 2 or 3 stars, but since everybody gives it between 4 and 5 stars I just wanted to drop down the overall reviewer ranking :-)"
2,What happened to their awesome punk rock/ska sound?,"This is probably going to be the most disappointing music purchases of my life. Five Iron Frenzy had such a great sophomore release in ""Our Newest Album Ever"",that I thought they would stick with their awesome punk-ska sound, and forever be remembered as one of the best in the genre. Instead, with the most recent release from the Five Iron bunch, they almost completely took all the punchy edge out their sound. ""All The Hype That Money Can Buy,"" has such a watered down sound,I can't stand to listen to it with all their older(and much better)stuff in my possesion. I however, can't deny them of two good punk-ska songs on here, The Phanton Mullet and Farenheit are both pretty decent songs. Besides that, all I can say is they very slowly went the way of the Supertones. It's a shame."
2,Shapes into nothing.....,"I like Covenant, but I wasn't impressed with this release. The songs are kind of flat, and although not bad, they just lack energy. I saw them in concert supporting this cd, and it was quite good, but they really seemed sort of conceited. After the show, the ushers, and a stage hand announced that the band would be at an after party in a bar in Cleaveland a few blocks down, but the group never showed up.It's a so-so recording with no zip. Try Northern Light first."
3,They Make Ritual Noise,"What made Covenant's last effort, Northern Light, very good was that the band seemed oblivious to how good they were. A slight, humbling unsuredness really.This humility is alas devoid on Skyshaper, and while things aren't as far as being pretentious and pompous, they are nonetheless annoying at times. The very first song, Ritual Noise, has the lines of ""We make ritual noise, we weave the fabric of dreams..."" and other likesuch talk of grandeur as made by them.The special edition version I got has some photos of frozen landscapes, the band looking cool-Swedish, and some rather space-y sounding quotes from the band. They sound like they've been translated from Japanese... which is odd considering the lyrics are otherwise devoid of little mispronunications/misgrammarizations one tends to hear from bands that come from non-English speaking countries.Perhaps it'll grow on me, but still I don't feel compelled to listen to it very often."
2,Only 3 Experiments,"My 7 year old received this science kit for his birthday. It only has three experiments and we completed them all in less than 15 minutes. He was excited about the glowing chemicals but obviously, it was short lived. This item is not worth $[...]. There are not enough materials to repeat any of the experiments."
2,Just Okay....,The writting is small and very dictionary-esq. I much better preferred Martha Stewart's Big Blue Book of Housekeeping tips!
5,Don Aslett has done it again!!!!,"If you have read some of Mr Aslett titles already, then it becomes axiomatic, you'll read this one! To the uninitiated, Don Aslett is a major player in his field. He started from the bottom, learnt by his mistakes & developed a science out of domestic & commercial cleaning. He has worked for so long & managed to record what has worked & why for him. He now gives very good talks on cleaning for housewives (home-makers) to improve their own outlook, save considerable time & give more ""quality time"" to their family. The only problem I have with his titles now, is I realise I do need reading glasses with reaching the big five ohh a fortnight ago!! Don Aslett also has brought commercial cleaning supplies direct to the domestic cleaning scene, so making a massive improvement to domestic chores. Go on, spend the dosh on this (& his other titles) !!"
3,Good story bad copy,"Overall the story was good, even though the first one was better. But it is a nice edition if your like me and want to start criminal empire 3. Story is not bad, but the quality of the book was bad. The binding came right off. But overall if your a fan who wants to start reading crimson empire, it's a good edition and sets the stage for crimson empire 3."
2,10 pounds of story in a 5 pound bag,"Crimson Empire II continues the story of Kir Kanos, last of the Emperor's Crimson Guard out to avenge the Emperor by killing everyone responsible for his death.The first book was fairly clear-cut, focusing on the battle between Kanos and a renegade Crimson Guardsman responsible for killing the Emperor's clone bodies. But this is one is all over the map. It introduces several new factions and players (including a Hutt gangster who could give Jabba a run for his money) but never has enough time to properly flesh them out. We see them plot and scheme but it really has no impact since we're never given a chance to care about them.Kir Kanos it practially a supporting player in this story, since so much time is spent throwing in new aliens, new factions and new alliances.This series desperately needed to be longer, or an editor needed to give it more focus. Most readers will leave disappointed."
5,Cool!,"Atlantic Starr was the real band back in 80's! From their early tracks such as late 70's funk 'Stand Up' or 'Let's Rock & roll' to 80's super hits uplifting 'Circles','Freak-a-ristic' or 'Love Me Down' with the super slow jams smooth 'Secret LOvers','My First Love' or 'Touch A Four Leaf Clover', this compliation is outstanding. Every Atlantic Starr fan should have it. Sharon Byrant & Lewis Bros. were underrated talents during when they were popular. This cd brings back the memories from good-old-times. A must have!"
5,Download the music for free on our website!,We don't get paid for anyone downloading our music and we have NO idea where the money (if any) GOES!!!www.jacksaints.comAlso we have a NEW CD out now on Scarey Records in Italy...it's much better!you can buy it online via paypal.thanks!(new album being written and recorded)
5,"original quintet recordings, accept no substitutes","This is the one to own. Forget about ""Complete Singles, 1964-1966"", a 2009 release on Varese Fontana. While that set boasts remastered sound, these primitive recordings sound best, as is. Even worse, that release's version of the original quintet's one bonafide hit,""She's About a Mover"" is an imposter, a full 35 seconds longer, and not the nugget we know. Also, the other set's completeness is questionable. If you acquire this set and it's sister volume, ""The SDQ is Back !"", you'll have 28 tracks, 10 more than the imposter set. This is clearly the way to go, more music, original versions, mono glory. The quintet was resurrected in 1968 and that, relatively, cleaned up sound is beautifully documented on the five disc Complete Mercury Recordings, or Sundazed recent Mono Singles offering, but this is where you come for the early raunch. Accept no substitutes."
4,I didn't like it at first,"But now I've grown to like it. You have to paint in thin coats and do 2-3 coats of it for it to look good. It's streaky at first but after the second coat, it gets better. Also, give it time to dry. It's an interesting color but I would probably pick something else over it if looking for a cute minty color. It's a little too weird."
1,terrible,I love China Glaze's nail polishes but this one is terrible. I bought it because it is a very unique color and thought it would look great for summer. It took 5 coats for it to actually be seen on my nails but it was still extremely streaky. It also looked very dry and matte even after applying a top coat. I immediatley took it off and threw it away. It's horrible. Do not waste you money.
3,Dries matte???,"Love the color, but it dries matte. It's not a matte polish. So I don't know what is wrong with that."
1,Very Sheer,"This color is VERY sheer, after about 5 coats you will finally get an opaque color and then it peels off in about a day. Definitely avoid this nail polish."
3,its allright,"I do like the nail polish but the color is SO metallic it ends up looking a bit grey. The formula is also very very thin, but I like it. I prefer it to something to thick. the coats will dry fast so nothing to worry about. its a nice color, I just wish it was more black rather than grey. A good buy. I would recommend it, but not for a black nail polish. maybe for a dark metallic grey."
3,good,"I liked this product but not as good as some of the other china glaze ones, it just didn't glide on as well.."
1,China Glaze Flying Dragon :(,"Totally hate it. In the bottle, it looks like a fun fuchsia with blue and pink micro glitter, but in reality, it dries unattractively matte, shows EVERY brush stroke, and the glitter (which is barely visible) resembles little pebbly specks. A huge disappointment since it looked so nice in the bottle. I managed to salvage the manicure by hiding it under a glittery top coat, but I think this is ultimately going into the swap pile. I still love China Glaze, I just don't consider this to be one of their successes."
2,Hot color but chips fast...,"Make sure you know the real color prior to buying the product. It's a really nice neon and you need a top coat to make it shine. However, the color chipped within a day even with a top coat on. I'd rather just buy a different brand that holds up longer."
1,Horrible,It has zero shine and takes at least 3 coats to look OK. Then you would need a top coat. I threw mine away.
5,Four Leaf Clover.. Worth It!,"First, I'll have to admit, China Glaze is now my favorite brand of nail polish out there.. But Four Leaf Clover is by far the best green color I own, now it does have a blueish tint but it's a very good color and it only take a couple coats to be opaque."
3,"Good quality polish, color is off","The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though."
3,The Color Not What I Expected,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."
5,fast shipping product as described,"Very Good product and super fast shipping. Would recommend to others . Love the color, painted my nails as soon as I opened the package"
2,Greener than Tiffany Blue,"Maybe I got a ""bad"" batch of this nail polish, but what I received is much greener than ""Tiffany Blue""."
1,"Consistency is poor, won't use it again","I can't even describe the consistency of this polish. It's thick and runny at the same time. In some places it goes on too thick and in others you can see through it. It takes FOREVER to dry, even with only one thin coat. I painted my nails several hours before bed and when I woke up there were sheet marks all over and there were dents on every nail. I ended up taking it off because it just felt thick and sticky even 24 hours later. I only even got one coat on! I tried to like it because I love the color, but I hope I can find something similar elsewhere."
3,prospective buyers be aware,"1 The "" leather"" cover is bonded leather.2 The binding is not sewn3 The cover on mine was detached front and rear on arrival4 The paper used is not the quality one would expect at the price ( rather a high quality paper back).Given the preface(s) indicating the obvious concern Mr Green has for the New Testament scriptures the above are particularly disappointing given that a very few extra dollars expended by the publishers during production could easily have remedied these mattersThank you Amazon for your helpful remedy."
4,Recommend,Excellent book on how and why we should and can be very connected with one another. It states in much detail the importance of friend relationships.
1,failure,"I work on windows xp sp2, and in fact it was me bad I have tried to install it but he enters in conflict and it doesn't allow to install the controllers it asks me him to move away the previous controllers and I make it but it is not allowed to configure with controllers standar VGA and therefore it has not been possible to install. I disappoint myself since I have always used ATI, therefore I had to reinstall the old ATI 9700 Pro 128"
3,To much information,"The way this book was written was confusing to me. I felt like the author was trying to cover every finishing technique known to man, when I wanted something to give me a start to finish technique. Maybe this was my fault, but I found the way the information was organized very confusing."
2,Just a pile of plastic pieces!,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He loves to play pretend with animals and people. I thought this would be a step up (as far as age) from the Little People Playsets. I was so excited to give him this toy and after hour and a half of putting this together he was ready to play. After 5 minutes of play the whole thing practically fell apart. After putting it back together again its just fell apart again. I couldnt believe my eyes! This toy ended up being just a pile of plastic pieces. I ended up returining the Treehouse and taking my chances on another Playmobil set and bought the Treasure Chest. This was a better choice. Takes 5 minutes to set up and doesnt fall apart when playing with it.
5,Great Dog Treats,"Both my dogs really love these. The individual pieces are small so 1) they go a long way, 2) you can feed several and not worry about overfeeding.They work well as training treats.Price seemed a little high initially, but given how far they go and how much my dogs love them they are well worth the price to me."
3,One reason to buy this CD,"As someone who has both BBD's fine first album and bad second album, I was stunned to see they have put out a greatest hits set. There is one good reason for the album's existence, though: the inclusion of the excellent ""Gangsta,"" which was originally meant for their second album (""Hootie Mack"") but inexplicably left off (I'm sorry to say I didn't realize that till I put the CD on. Of course, for those who don't have the first CD, the greatest hits package is a worthy buy -- you can raise my rating to 4 stars. For those who do have the first CD, download ""Gangsta"" off Napsta and reduce my rating on this to 2 stars."
4,Skid marks the Movie,This movie was hilarious. you have to love Neal and Bob. they cracked me up. I would recommend this for just pure fun and slap stick silly humor
2,good and bad,"The camera has many great features to offer. There are many different scene modes which enhances the picture specific to the object/scene. Another great feature is the fast shutter time, the time it takes to capture the image after pressing the button, and a great flash.One bad con which should really be focused on is, the image quality is less than average. Especially, the more one zooms in to the object/scene, the more the image quality is reduced. Even without any zoom, the image quality isn't as clear and sharp as other cameras. Another minor con is, the camera isn't meant for big fingers because the buttons are rather small including the zoom button.If one wants a simple camera with great features and an easy-to-use interface, the camera is for you. A true photographer, however, should consider the Exilim's image quality before buying."
2,Good Camera-Bad Flash,"I used this camera for almost half a year and didnt have many problems with it. I loved the picture quality and everything, but It likes to take pictures when it wants to. I followed the instruction manual, and even called support.I recently returned this camera because in the end, flash stopped working altoghether."
4,Gault Milau PARIS only is great!,"If you are visiting Paris, I strongly recommend their Paris book, though I can't speak for this combined volume. It is a particulary good book for those who have previously experience the City of Light and are searching for less ""touristy"" hotels, restaurants and activities.For example, I discovered the charming Paris canal boat tour in the GM guide. If you've already done the Bateaux Mouches, this is the kind of excursion that will delight you. They also list chocolate and cheese shops that are well worth a visit.Get the GM Paris guide if you're looking to add new dimensions to your Paris experience."
4,"Very Good,has led onto further purchases from Sang H Kim","I bought this whilst in the UK, and had to import from US.The DVD is broken down into the different levels, from Beginner to Intense, which is ideal for the different levels of flexibility (I started from basic and I am building up gradually..)The programs last a maximum of 20 Minutes each which is good if you are short for time or get bored easily doing sessions over 30mins.I already participate in Kickboxing (Intermediate level) and found that even within a week of this stretching my kicking has improved in speed and height.So something must be working..:-)I found the whole DVD of a good standard, and am currently in the process of buying more from Sang H Kim.No-nonsense, straight down to it attitude and the little comment at the end of every session, of ""I'll see you tommorrow"" Really works for me!"
3,Adequate,"This is an adequate book - a condensed history of Bill Gate's professional career. It is easy to read and understand. It is obvious the author did their research in preparing this novel-like biography. However, the copy I received had a superfluous chapter. While the book did an excellent job of detailing Gates' professional accomplishments, it merely referred to his personal life and philanthropy, which I was most interested in. Nonetheless, it gave an excellent history to Bill Gates' life up until the late nineties."
2,hard to navigate,"it has the info I wanted, but it is not in an easy concise format for use on the job"
2,YUCK!,I was required to buy this book when I started nursing school last year. It was fine for the minute things we needed to look up in Fundamentals but it is not fine now! It contains very little pertinent information & what it does contain is so condensed that it is not helpful. It also doesn't do a very good job of relating the lab tests to particular disorders/diseases. I just ordered a different book & I will be getting rid of this one. I have a classmate that is getting a different book as well because this book isn't helpful to her either.
2,least helpful book i have gotten for nursing school,"this book has a lot of info but the way it is presented makes it very hard to find info that's needed to complete an assignment, especially in clinicals when you pressed on time."
5,pleased,have not had chance to use it but seems sturdy enough for what i need . very light and easy to store
5,eat them,these things taste good and seem to be free of most of the crappy ingredients that are found in a lot of protein bars and powders.
2,to sweet,"to sweet for me, but its like the rest full protein, Kcal AND MUCH MORE etc. to sweet for me"
1,aweful taste,The only reason I tried this is because the 5 start review.I can not believe how bad it tastes.TOO sweet and too much calories.Coundn't finish even a bite and have to trash all of them
5,What Smart Students Know,"As a teacher, I have used this book for two semesters as a text in my study skills class at a community college. Each class that tries Robinson's techniques has improved grades. We have supplemented it with material found on the internet. Robinson is somewhat weak on math courses, but the principles have been applied successfully by my students to science, math, history, literature, writing, and other courses. They are thrilled that their grades have gone up (although I think they were a pair of pretty sharp groups to start with)."
3,Confusing telling,This bookk was about Black History. It tells about black history as well as Martin Luther King and some of his protests. It also tells about slaves being brought over to america and sold like animals. I learned that everyone thought seperate but equal was okay. But it doesn't mean that it was equal. THis is some of the things in the book.
4,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! He was shot,"I really liked this book because I didn't know where, who, how and when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. But when I read this book it told me everything about him and about all the black slaves back then. I think that we should all read this book because it tells you everything you need to know of how Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. The best story element for this book is suspense because it has a lot of that in this book. Because you never know what they are going to tell you next. This was an awesome book and the author was incredible. Way to go!! Thanks for listening and I hope that it was helpful."
2,Physical aspects,"The binding and paper used of this print batch are very poor, much worse than the last print one that I borrowed from the library. Disappointed."
3,Publish or Perish,"""Chutzpah"" comes to mind - a lawyer makes up the facts. Mello claims privileged conversations with a man whom the US legal system defied the Constitution to silence , but Mello himself blots out the most elementary realities of the ""Unabomber"" story. When Kaczyinski fled Berkeley the university was under the thumb of a rogue cop who went on the become US Attorney General; Niixon had signed an order suspending civil rights in California and ""Operation Cable Splicer"" was shooting up the University community. Corrupt corporate interests had gained control of at least one environmentally vital professional school. Who would listen to alarms from this ataciturn, over-educated young math professor? Now that's a story worth telling; I don't think Mello bothered to find out what was going on those days in Berkeley."
1,"Dont buy this, For god sake Do not buy this.","Worst thing i have ever bought, i bought it brand new and the screen was cracked internally, It was also a total pain texting on it it wasnt sensitive at ALL! I returned it the same night and my money isnt even back in my credit card i would never reccomend buying anything from amazon. Oh and they sent me a charger for a different country other then the USA Who does that? I wish i could rate it a negative star cause it sucked big time."
5,WHAT AN AWESOME WONDER!,"Kurt Carr's Awesome Wonder is Awesome. From In the Santuary to Set the Atmosphere, all the songs are the bomb! Listening to the CD is great, but hearing the Kurt Carr Singers in person is such a blessing. I got the chance to meet them in Memphis,TN for the C.O.G.I.C. Convocation and they are beautiful people on the inside as well as the outside. I encourage everyone to go pick up the album because it is definitely worth it!"
2,Save your Money... I'll sell you mine cheap ;-),"It was hard to watch this movie without critiquing Kate Hudson. She was too cutesy to pull it off. It got annoying after awhile. About the only value she added was occasional big smiles that reminded us of her famous Mom. My husband and I usually love John Corbett but we felt he could've contributed more to this film than he did. The chemistry wasn't present between the two main characters and Kate's ""I'm so cute"" persona just made us squirm. The children were much better... and we believe the real star power of this movie was Joan Cusack. Go Joan! The sad part is it could've been a really good movie, with some more thoughtful casting, directing and story flow. Lots of holes. Kate wasn't believable as a savvy administrative assistant. But Helen Mirren as the model agency owner was fun... except her character lost credibility for tolerating all the sloppiness of Kate's character. I'm giving it two stars because we didn't fall asleep while watching it."
3,The movie was good.,"The plot was good, I really enjoyed the sister relationship that Kate and Joan had. They really played well off each other. I think that the movie had wonderful way about it. It flowed nice, and reminded you that you have to choose what you want in life, and move for it. Sometimes it isn't what you always think you want.I am not a huge Kate fan. She acts the same in every movie. I guess I am looking for a change in her. But the kids were great actors, and I thought it was well told. This is a good movie. You'll enjoy it."
3,GREAT!!! (My rating for this movie is actually 3 1/2 stars),"This movie was far above my expectations. This story surrounds Helen (Kate Hudson) who works at a modeling agency. Everything is going well for her until she finds out her sister and her husband died in a car crash and they left in their will custody of their three children to Helen. Helen first thinks this is absurd because her older sister has children and is more mother like than she, but she ends up taking them in. She learns how to be a mom and things go wrong. She has never had to take care of kids ever. Kate Hudson does another fantastic performance. She fits the part perfectly. When I went in to see this movie, I knew it was going to be sad, but not so sad. I almost cried. I think everyone should go see this movie, especially moms. It has a few inappropriate parts, but not very bad at all. It just has some issues about growing up. This movie was excellent!! I am so impressed. Go see it everyone!!"
2,Leave Helen where she is,"Where to start?If you're a fan of movies that will throw you into depression and leave you pining for that seven dollars you just spent on the movie, then this is the dvd for you.The movie is about Helen Harris, a gorgeous women with a wonderful job and a ride of a boyfriend. How could it all go so wrong? I'll tell you how: Her sister and her brother-in-law were killed in a car accident and they left their children to Helen, instead of the other sister, an uptight mother personality. Cue millions of highly unrealistic situation, some-not funny jokes, enough morals to write a book about and several cameo apperances by Paris Hilton.Now, if you're into that sort of thing, then this is your sort of movie. I don't happen to be. And if you're wondering why I gave this two stars instead of one, it's because Joan Cusack is funny. Happy viewing."
2,"Another tired melange of other, better films","Ho hum. Been there; seen that. Baby Boom anyone? Even the awful, more recent Uptown Girls. I don't know why Garry Marshall went this oft-trod route. Marshall is known for his slick, harmless romantic/schmaltzy comedies and this is no exception. Well, except that there really isn't too much comedy here. Hudson can be so adorable - but she is wasted and dull here. The only high points involve Cusack and Mirren. See it only if you're in ""that"" mood. Better yet, watch Baby Boom."
4,Lighthearted and Fun,"We got this movie on a hunch and wound up having a reasonably fun time at the movies. Although much of it is rather formulaic the characters are interesting enough to engage the viewer and generate some concern and sympathy for the situation. There are a few special features which have some entertainment value, especially the deleted scenes.The story focuses on a young career woman in New York City who suddenly finds herself the caregiver for three children. The problems and challenges presented by that complication are the central theme of the story and do provide some entertaining moments. We enjoyed the movie but will not watch it again anytime soon. The movie is rated PG-13."
4,The Comedian,"Well-scripted Eod Serling (Twilight Zone) script elevated even further by a brilliant ""live"" performance by Mickey Rooney. Creative, innovative and intense ""hehinf-the-scwnws"" look at an emotionally insecure television comic and those parallel lives heviciously terrorizes around hum...destroting everything/everyone aroung him. Finesupporting performances from Edmond O'Brien, Kim Hunter, King Donovan and a highly-effective Mel Torme' in a dramatic change of pace. Exciting view of a 1950's livetelevision drama, from the often superb and genuinely orinial Playhouse 90 (which ledthe pack in the golden days of television). A MUST SEE, NEVER EQUALLED TV DRAMATICMOMENT!The late, great Paul Muni noted Eooney's performance with a ""thanks, for the actinglesson!"""
1,Did not fit,I got the bundle as described for my blackjack. The car charger only fit the phone when inserted upside down. The carrying case absolutely did not fit. I finally just bought one one cingular...got tired of fooling with it.....
4,Misguided ideals and purity of thought.,"A wonderful performance by All the Players taking part in this chunk of history, as astonishing as; ""The Prisoner of Shark Island."" To quote from James Swanson's informative and meticulously researched book 'Manhunt' - Asia Booth's (John Wilkes Booth's sister) loving memory to her brother closes with a graveside elegy: ""But, granting that he died in vain, yet gave his all on earth, youth, beauty, manhood, a great human love, the certainty of excellence in his profession,a powerful brain, the strength of an athlete, health and great wealth, for 'his cause.' This man was noble in life, he periled his immortal soul, and he was brave in death. Already his hidden remains are given Christian burial, and strangers have piled his grave with flowers."" ""'So runs the world away.'"""
3,One Disappointment,"Text is simple and rhymes which is an added bonus for young listeners. It shows examples of things children often do (e.g. jumping, climbing, playing) and their resulting shadow. I wanted to use this book for a shadow lesson, but one disappointment is one of the illustrations used which is inaccurate by depicting reflections on a pond rather than shadows. This can be confusing when trying to teach the shadow concept. You could turn it into a lesson by reading the book and then telling students that one picture is ""wrong"" and seeing if they can find which picture doesn't show a shadow, but shows something else.Disappointing inaccuracy nonetheless."
3,Interesting... but missing something,"I would highly recommend this book on behalf of descriptive, beautiful and intelligent writing. Having been a nanny for a short time I can understand some of the actions that Randi carried out. YET as i reader i felt the joke was on me for believing i'd find out anything deeper about any of these characters or about their past. Maybe it was some of the suspense that I clung to hoping to gain insight. Some issues only scratched the surface to something more telling but we never found out any information. Overall, it was a Very well written book but i felt very let down by the characters in the end and was full of many questions. Of course maybe i was supposed to feel that way."
1,Unsatisfying,"The ""ruling class parents in need of somebody to raise Binky and Muffy"" concept has created a genre onto itself with films, books, movies of the week, etc, that create nightmare scenarios in which the babysitter kills and seduces. In this novel the parents are the problem and the author makes fun of them in the way only one of their peers can. And while the writing is strong, oy, the ending is just...annoying."

3,Field Guide for Song birds,"An interesting compilation of songbird sounds along with the name of each bird. Does not go into the wide variation of song that many birds are capable of, eg. the Carolina Wren. Somewhat helpful as an addition to Peterson's field guide to birds."
5,Bird Songs,"If you're serious about birding and bird songs, this is the product you want, bar none. Others have songs within the birding programs but this is strictly dedicated to songs. Take a cd player with you when you go birding. I know, you rather have mp3 so convert them if you want."
5,Great Facial Brush,"When I ordered this facial brush I was a bit apprehensive. I wasn't sure if the bristles would be too rough for my sometimes sensitive skin. The things that I really like about this brush is that the handle is high quality plastic (it is easy to clean and dry) and the bristles are not synthetic, they exfoliate very well and are not too rough on the skin. You should rub the bristles on the back of your hand just to soften them at first. After a few weeks of using the brush twice a week it is still in good shape. I highly recommend to those with blackheads because within one time of using this brush mine were all gone! I didn't use the brush for a week and they did come back, so just use the brush on a weekly basis."
3,"Commercial Grade, but is it durable?","Purchased two. One failed completely in a year. The second is still in use after nearly 4 years, but only registerscentigrade temperature. OK for scientific or Euro crowd. Good initial price, but lost half value over 1 year. Reliability issues. Pricy for real value. Commercial users may want to buy a more expensive, more reliable unit for the long haul."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, and expected a first rate Tarzan adventure, like Farmer's ""Lord of the Trees"". Instead, the book wanders all around with no focus. Tarzan goes through earthquakes, floods, uninteresting lost cities, encounters with weird little half-men, etc etc etc. None of these are important to whatever story there is, and after awhile, I got tired of trying to make my brain believe there was a story there. As an attempt at a Tarzan story, it falls flat. Even Tarzan's character is off-kilter. Tarzan is completely reactive through the whole story, instead of the proactive hero we are used to. Well...I will keep The Lord of the Trees and A Feast Unknown, but The Dark Heart of Time is going straight to the used bookstore."
3,BIG FAT HAIRY DEAL...,"Is anyone else grown tired of the ""revelations"" that turn out to be eons-old-news? The ""fluidity of self"" and such..how many sutras, psalms and heard-in-a-coffee-shop-bad-poems have been composed on the subject? If one had felt the need, one could have waxed nihilistic in the neolithic over the implications of *the symbol* for representing a notion..or more recently, the telegraph for sending data. the book is 8 years too late and dismisses non-computational models of mind, information, thinking, etc."
5,A must read !,"This book outlines the scientific and technological advances that allow us to manipulate genomes at the level of single genes, develop machines that will surpass the human brain in computing power, and build an interconnected world of information-processing devices. The book makes a compelling and provocative argument that human control of our species genes will surpass the path of natural evolution. The thesis, that post-genomic biology will change the direction of human evolution, is both appealing and disquieting and poses a number of unanswered ethical dilemmas. The book is well-written with good sense of humour !"
1,Horrible Book,I detest this book. I through it out immediately after I was forced to read it for class. Never read it. The best review that I can give is: Piece of sh*t. Just don't read it.
5,Great Book!,"This is a very interesting and useful book. It is thoroughly researched and organized. I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Oahu with children. I got it to help entertain my grandchildren when they come and it turned out to have things in it that I will find interesting to do by myself, such as the walking tours of old Honolulu."
1,booooooring!,"How can a mafia book be so boring? This reads like the author took facts from a police blotter ""ver batem"" and made a book about it. Doesn't go into depth into any of the characters. Doesn't tell me anything new about Trafficante or any other Florida thugs. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"
5,"The ""REAL BOSS"" of Music and MPB !","This guy, ""Tom Ze"" is his very own musical machine creation encorporated, ""disenterred"", still alive but never a ZOMBIE ! I like to think of him as a lot of ""Spike Jones"", with a chug-a-lug of ""Frank Zappa"", the chops of ""Stevie Wonder"" and the spice of ""Carmen Miranda"" all in one sword of churrasco meat-music to slice off one track at a time ! The innuendo and sarcasm is enately Brazilian and ""O Mestre Tom Ze"" serves it all up on a firery platter of intellectualism and political relativism rarely seen in today's young artists of the other music genres. If you go to a Tom Ze live performance, bring ""O MESTRE"" an apple for the teacher and set it on the stage......He'll probably find a way to make it a musical instrument just to prove that HE is ""The Boss"", all the way down to the core ! Then after the show please kiss him on the lips for me and buy him a caipirinha! He just ""TANGOLOMANGO""s me all in a little ball of ""Silly String"" love !"
2,What is all the fuss about?,"I really don't understand why she has been compared to serious mystery writers. The only mystery is that I was gullible enough to buy this book for my birthday. Wesley brand named dropped throughout the entire book. The language was mediocre, plot below average, the characters barely one dimensional- the most exciting character in the book was her son Jamal. Hopefully her other books are better.than this"
4,Death By Peanut Butter,"Long after I've forgotten mysteries based on ornate plots, I still remember the ones based on interesting characters -- and this one by Valerie Wilson Wesley is a pip! In addition to Tamara Haynes' hard-working private investigator, we have a wealthy and philandering street boy made good (Lincoln Storey) and a whole fascinating crew of people who stood to gain from his death under suspicious circumstances: his smooth but untrustworthy wife Daphne; her daughter Alexa from another marriage; Alexa's friend Tasha (who is arrested for murdering him); the restaurateur Tate -- an old family friend of Tamara's; aspiring politician and attorney Stella Pharr; and Brandon Pike, who is squiring Daphne and Alexa around a couple of years after having broken up with Tamara.Incidentally, the murder weapon is -- peanut butter. Someone laced Storey's bean dip; and Storey was notorious for his allergy to peanuts.So kick off your shoes, relax, and let Tamara show you what happened."
5,PLANTERS PEANUT BAR,"VERY GOOD AND I AM ENJOYING LIKE A KID. I WOULD LIKE TO GET NEXT TIME, OLD DOMINION PEANUT BAR.THANKS."
4,I picked this up because of ATL native India Arie,"This CD turned out to be a very good buy. Banging soulful tracks by Angie Stone with ""Slippery Shoes"" and and classic remakes by Badu on ""Hollywood. Goodie Mob drops versus over a Dj Muggs track and Common featuring Erykah Badu shine new light on his already hit single ""the light"". Other artist featured are the Roots, Zach-De-La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, Gerald Levert, and a banging new track from Prince. The special attraction to this CD is India Arie. An up in coming artist out of Atlanta who has a very incredible voice. ""God In You"" and ""In My head"" are two of my favorite tracks by her on this CD. If you need more reasons to pick this up, Mos Def, Canibus and muMs from HBO's ""OZ"" rip up the track ""Blak Iz Blak"". This will probaly be a soundtrack that will get looked over because of today's music vibe but to who ever is reading this......GO GET IT!!oNe"
3,Same old stuff,"Season Six part one gives us nothing new regarding depth. This series has gotten really tired and I am glad they decided to put it to sleep. Carrie Bradshaw continues to be self important and thinks she is the only one in the world that matters. Her charecter has not matured throughout six seasons, nor has she developed any self worth. She finds spending huge amounts of money on shoes, handbags and clothing will translate to finding ""the one"". What a sad staement on sinlges in New York if this is true. Maranda continues her ""I am too smart for Steve"" tactics and again shows how shallow she is. Charlotte is a lost soul and a perfect example of ""the granola"" type. Samatha is the only charecter that makes this show worth the time. She is witty and does not give a damn about what others think about her."
1,Greedy! Greedy! Greedy!! HBO,"I bought seasons 1-4 but have not shelled out the ridiculous amount they are trying to sell season 5 for~ 8 measly episodes (and the most boring of all six seasons, imo). Now season 6 is coming out, actually HALF the season, at FULL price? HBO sucks! I have all the episodes on tape and will just pick up the dvd later on Ebay once the prices fall. I totally agree with every angry viewer here!! It's companies like HBO that encourage viewers to participate in piracy!!"
4,I love this show,"When the show was on TV regularly, my household did not have HBO as part of the cable package. For the years ""Sex and the City"" was on , I always watched the award shows (Emmys, Golden Globes, etc) and I never got what all the hoopla about ""Sex"" was. A few weeks ago my friend recieved this season for a christmas gift. I had never seen a single episode prior to the final season. But I loved all of them. Me and my girlfriends are always in the mood to watch a little ""Sex and the City"" when we are feeling down in the dumps and need a good laugh. These women go through everything in the book when it comes to men and relationships. You can relate to all of the situations in some way.It amazes me how someone could write a show like this. That's talent right there. Some may call this type of show perverse and totally immoral but I call it hysterical! I wish I could have enjoyed the show when it was still on the air. Thank God for DVDs!"
3,The waiting game...again,"The extras that they offer on this DVD are well worth watching - it is only your pocketbook that will suffer. It is like getting one half of a pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes.It is nice that they have released Season 6 on DVD but not so nice that they have divided it into two box sets - with no date in sight as to when the final episodes will be released.With the series now moving to TBS they have even removed it from HBO on Demand two weeks early. Those who missed the final few episodes the first time around will have to wait...perhaps till Christmas...for the Season 6 Part Two. Don't let TBS be your first introduction to this series...every word and scene is wonderful, and should not be cut for commercials."
1,Worth Watching but HBO has been UNFAIR & GREEDY!,"This is a rip off plain & simple! I love the show but like many have said before me - this is greed and it just ain't worth it! I can't even grasp these short sighted reviewers defending this garbage. If you are a true fan . . . blah, blah, blah! It took an amazing amount of gall to package season 6 in two parts - it is just about being FAIR - not about your loyalty to the show or how good it was. Give me a break. The first 4 seasons were fabulous and I would have recommended them to anyone - I even bought the less than stellar season five without a peep. But this is truly a rip off. I believe the final two episodes are fantastic - they couldn't have ended this any better but believe me - find an alternate method to watch season six or WAIT until HBO comes to its senses. The extras aren't even worth it."
4,I LOVE IT BUT..........,I loved the 6th season of Sex and the City and all the season before. I am proud owner of all the seasons and watch them all the time to see how the characters matured. I do agree with alot of the other reviewers that it is not right that HBO released season 6 in two parts. I am disappointed that they did that to the viewers who love the show so much to buy it.
1,Rating the price and release only -not the content!,"I agree with other reviewers here. I am a long-time fan of this show. I own all of the seasons on DVD with the exception of this new one and I will not be buying it. HBO are greedmongers: they have made the extremely poor decision to screw the viewers by releasing season 6 in 2 parts but charging full price for each part. HBO, you should be ashamed! This is an excellent show and this season does not disappoint but I would encourage everyone not to buy this!"
3,"Great series...but I'll watch my taped videos, thank you.","I don't see why ""real true fans"" of this show must go out and buy this DVD...unless being a fan of SATC is synonymous with being a sucker for media marketing and hype. So, thanks but no thanks, I'm not going to ""suck up"" and buy this, until it lands on ebay or the sale rack. I'm as much a fan as anyone else, but I like to be smart about what I spend my money on (shoes). I agree with another reviewer, it is prices like these that encourage piracy."
1,"Two stars for the season, one star for the price.","First of all, if you haven't seen Sex and the City, go buy the FIRST sesaon. It's excellent. And, on Amazon, you can get it under $28. That's the ENTIRE fist season. But now, HBO wants to retail just half of the sixth season for $50? This season is not that good when compared to the earlier seasons--the plots are tired, the actresses seem to have had enough of these roles. So to ask $100 for the full sixth season is rediculous. I'm confused here--for the best season, HBO sells it for $28, but for the worst (or maybe the fifth season was the worst?) they want $100 retail.My rec: this wouldn't even be worth $50 for the entire sixth season, and it's certainly not worth $50 for just half of it."
5,will watch until I am 109,"Yes, HBO got us by splitting this into two disc's but if you are a sex in the city true fan it would not make a difference if they split them up in 10. You would still buy the movie. I watched this on HBO for the first two season's and then cancelled HBO I then subscribed again for the last season and wish I had not missed any of them. So like a good little fan I purchased all of the season's 1-6.1. I would stay up until 2 or 3 am watching these fantastic women go through the journey of love and friendship. It made me want to move to New York. I live in Los Angeles and have been on my job for over 25 years, I still want to move to New York because of these wonderful women and their wonderful characters. I love this DVD as well as the previous 5 and I have purchased the first movie and can't wait until the next movie come out. When I need to laugh I watch SEX and the City. I love them all but Samantha is my favorite."
3,A rip-off,"I was annoyed at how they split the last season into 2 parts...do the producers really need the money? For only a few episodes, you definately don't get your what you pay for. However the show is refreshingly funny and a must own if you love SATC. The episodes are hilarious even though you can sense some sadness in the air.."
5,My favorite season!!!,"I have enjoyed Sex and the City since day one. I was so sad to see it end, but thank God for VHS and DVDs. Anyway, I recommend this season for any die-hard SATC fan. You won't be disappointed. But what I want to know is, when is part 2 being released???????"
5,A touch of Hope....,"Marti Leimbach's, ""Daniel Isn't Talking"", is a story of a woman who discovers her son has autism. When Daniel's mother Melanie discovers that her son Daniel has been diagnosed with autism,it is her personal battle to help her child in any way she can. Stephen, Melanie's husband begins to withdraw from his family and demands that Daniel be sent away to a special school. Melanie is now faced with the challenge of helping her son on her own. Daniel meets with a number of different therapists, but the turning point comes when Daniel meets Andy O'Connor, who is a trained professional in ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis). Although another therapist tries to warn Melanie that ABA is not effective... Melanie gives Andy O'Connor a try of her own. Through this treatment, Andy truly changes the life of Daniel, and the spirit of Melanie...a great novel that provides hope and happiness. A recommended read!!"
1,"""used to be great, dried fruit""","The first time I ordered the product, it was great and that is why I bought it again. This time, it seems to have been a BIG mistake. The fruit was humid, hard and nothing like before. Should not forget to mention the big clumps of fruit stuck together, that were so hard it made my teeth hurt. Too bad. I used to love this product, and talk to my friends about it. Not anymore. :("
4,Weller has a Winner!,"I've read some dismissive reviews of this record, and I can't understand them (unless the authors just plain don't like Paul). It's excellent, whether or not you're a Weller fan (as I am). His voice is superb, and there is a sincerity and excitement to his renditions (Close to You never sounded less sappy!). The musicianship is first rate. It's true that I'd rather listen to a Weller original than a cover album, but it's still a fine effort!"
1,Please come back Paul!,"This record is barely worth mentioning. As a fan from the very beginning, I think I can safely say this is among Paul's worst. Passionless and dull-and really, most of these songs were dreadful to begin with. Why remake any of them? Paul-write and sing your own music! It's so much better than any of this! I don't understand any of the other reviews here. This is a tragic fall from an otherwise brilliant man."
1,bad choices,"Never, never, EVER mix drum sets with the cello!!!!!!The cello is, by nature, an instrument that creates an ethereal, mellow, oftentimes sorrowful sound that seeks a place in the heart that is seldom touched by any other means. You cannot put that to a drumbeat! It's like pouring catsup on a steak. It's so incredibly crass. It's embarrassing. Stop it. Stop it now."
5,better with repeated listens,"A great 2 CD set of electronic chill music. At first a few of the songs seemed not very interesting but with a few more listens, everything clicks. If you like their other CD, it is really worth getting this one."
3,Three days,"Three days is a story about an 11 year old girl named jackie who was abducted by a man after his own granddaughter of the same age had died.She was tacken to his home in italy and there she tried many times to leave.Read to find out how jackies attemps to flea turned out,and if she would ever be able to return to her family again.The story line was good,but the book was often slow moving and hard to keep my attention.I also thought the book ended to soon,I wanted to know what came next."
1,Cannot play U.K. movies in U.S.,I sure wish I had known that if you order a movie from the U.K. that I cannot play in on my D.V.D. player in the U.S. I sure wish Amazon had told me that before I bought the movie. Please let us know about that before we buy the movie. Thank You.
3,Junior Chef,The Junior Chef Bakeware Set was a nice addition for our Granddaugter to the oven we purchased for her.She enjoys the having her own bakeware set to use as she sees fit. Over all it seems well made and a pretty good value.
4,Algebra - the Basics,"A great book, second one in this series, by Debra Anne Ross. I can't believe that the author is not a mathematician but a Chemical Engineer. As I was familiar with the first one in this series, `the Basic Math and Pre Algebra', there wasn't any doubt whether to buy this or not. My purpose was to brush up my math after 22 years. This is neither a text book nor a replacement for it. If all you want is to brush up or learn the basics or a reference, this is the book for you. For more practice, finish this and get a text book; you will get a better picture. Written in a very simple and clear language and it is not just a collection of formulas or definitions or equations. I recommend"
3,Hints of what was to come,"Symphony X is an amazing band. However, you wouldn't really know that if you listened to this album.First off, vocals are weak. Very weak. But hey, there just aren't many vocalists who can stand up to the power and passion of Russell Allen. Not many at all. Musically there are hints of the great melodies we ended up getting from Symphony X, but it is quite obvious they are still in embryonic stage here. For casual fans, this is a skipper, but for those who really want to know Symphony X, this is a necessary page in the story of their evolution."
2,not very good,"well it is their debuit so im not really that angry with it, but to sum it up. the solos are yngwie malmsteen rip off's i hate yngwie. the riffs are weak and its not very progressive. also the singer on this cd is horrfic."
2,"Cute cups, ridiculous storage","Talk about lame packaging! The basket is flimsy and won't last long but worse is the molded plastic (under the pink fabric) that has indentations for the plates, cups etc to be set into. It's so flimsy we can feel it buckling every time my kid removes and replaces the settings. Cheap, cheap, cheap! The set itself is nice, although very tiny as stated before. The porcelain will far outlast the cheap packaging, which says something!"
2,TINY,"This set is very very cute, but it is very very small. My daughter wanted a tea set so bad and we finally got what we thought was a really cute one. when it arrived it was very disappointing. It was the tiniest tea set I have ever seen. The plate will barely hold the size of a ritz cracker. I would have never paid $30 for this had I saw it prior to purchasing."
3,Could be bigger . . .,"Bought this for my 4-yr old granddaughter because she loves picnics and tea parties. But, was a little surprised at how small all of the pieces actually are -- even the picnic basket. It will be a little difficult having real tea with this set."
5,Solid .NET foundation,"Microsoft-begrudged developers beware, .NET is actually pretty cool. I am typically wary of any technology or claim that Microsoft makes (being a Borland fan), but I am impressed with the .NET Framework and the thought that went into its design. After reading Advanced Windows (3rd) by Jeff in the past, I knew that this .NET book would be well written and informative. He did not let me down. This is a GREAT starting point for C# and VB.NET developers (note that most examples are in C#). I would strongly suggest that you have a good grasp of OO programming before you read this. His explanations are well thought out and the end result is that you too will be excited (and well informed) about .NET.Don't be dismayed if at first you don't grasp Chap 2 & 3, assemblies & packaging are strange beasts at first. Things get much easier after that and you soon find yourself comfortable with the chap 2/3 material."
5,Perfect book to unserstand .NET internals,I ready couple of chapters specially on .NET CLR and Assemblies. This is the book you want to mix with Don Box's .NET Internals to understand .NET internals ;). Trust me. You will know what goes under the hood.
4,Great Book!,"I have all the other DK ""Guides"" to Star Wars. I love the way those (and this) book is written... with an archelogical view point that treats the Star Wars universe as if it were ""real"".This installment (Incredible Locations) shows you cross sections of various EP I building and places and is quite interesting. It is especially helpful if you run Star Wars Role Playing games like I do (as you can show your players detailed ""blue prints and layouts"" of buildings).This book also has various tidbits of information about Star Wars and EP I that I have NEVER read anywhere else. I just hope that DK will release classic trilogy versions (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi).Buy with confidence if you are a Star Wars fan - You'll enjoy just browsing through that galaxy far, far away."
3,Late delivery:(,"This was the first time i bought an used book, the book was in good conditions. BUT... The delivery was BAD, i bought the book in august and the delivery information said i would revieved it in 5 - 7 labor days. I had to wait a month to receveive it. that""s not what i expected..."
2,Freda Payne Meets Rap !!??#@,"Pretty ruff-edged, unedited, and sometimes smooth jammin' CD, from an awful B-class movie! Freda Payne kicks-off the bluesy Ragdoll Jam, which adds some twangy guitar licks and harmonica wails but, oddly, Freda just doesn't convince me she's ever been through a ruff day out in them there streets, ever! The rest of the CD jams/raps pretty nicely, especially Phelon's ""Make it Happen,"" and Ugo's ""Be True."" Definately a sleeper of a CD, that deserves a second listen, especially at this give-away price!"
4,Does the job but not flexible...,"This flusher is an improvement from the one-sided version and does the job nicely; however, it would be much better if the cups could swivel in order to cover vertically oriented intake ports better."
3,Cookie-cutter but what the heck? It sounds OK,"Yes, New Found Glory has perhaps set the standard for sounding like itself 12 times in a row. With the lead singer's strangled, mangled, whiny, girlish, unbelievable voice, you would think that I'd call this collection of uncreative stuff pure garbage. But what the heck? Each song may sound like any other, but they all sound fine. Try this: play ""Better Off Dead"" immediately next to ""Hit or Miss,"" and compare. You'll find that, with different lyrics and only a few minor changes, they are, more or less, the same song. Hopefully, the next collection will be better, but I can live through this for a while."
3,This Isn't Punk...,"A New Found Glory is by no means a punk band. You can't be both pop and punk, they just don't go together. Anyway, I'm not some hardcore punker and I'm not one of those people that judge a band by how punk they are, but this band gets annoying after while and they are also extremely overated. They might have talent, but they lack innovation and the lead singer has to go. A New Found Glory doesn't even come close to similar bands such as The Ataris and Blink182, I mean there's really no contest. I suggest skipping this cd, because there are so many better bands out there."
3,"This isn't even close to punk,but a fun listen","This is the only pop punk record I can listen to.Is the music amazing? no,Is it extremely poppy? yes.Does The singers voice get annoying after a while? yeah, Are the lyrics lame as a vanilla ice record? come on,Your grandmother would probably find them cheesy!...Yet The songs I have to admit are really well written,and i'm not afraid to admit that I enjoy this unlike a lot of metal and punk tools out there.It's like listening to your favorite songs from the 80s...extremely corny,but you keep coming back for more due to the fact that everything is so catchy.They arnt even close to being punk....but it's a catchy record of energetic pop songs.If your too punk or metal for this..then you probably arn't very punk or metal in the first place to feel offended by this."
5,New Found Glory is off the shizzle forizzle,"... New Found Glory [is great], i just heard there song, Hit or Miss on MTV upcoming artist, a couple of years ago, and this album is the best. Now dont get me wrong, Sticks And Stones is also a good album, but this is way better, more punk, better meledy's.Better Off Dead-Best song on the albumHit or Miss-Great[]songAll About Her-Good song to play when your breakin up with herBallad for the Lost Romantics-Hopeselly addictive."
2,A disgrace to punk rock,"Bands like New Found Glory and Sum41 are nothing more than a bunch of dummies trying to copy Blink, who by the way are also regressing since they're too caught up in the pop-punk scene. Anhow, when I bought this album I listened to the first track (duh!). It was pretty good. Then I listened to about 20 seconds of each track after it, and they all sounded EXACTLY the same. The bottom line is, no matter which way you look at this ablum from, there is one good song and that is the first one that you listened to. SINCE THE REST ARE THE SAME!! My advice would be to buy an mp3 from this album. Then you already have the whole album. Also, if you thought you're interested in seeing them live at Warped Tour, skip their crap set and go check out Rancid, The Misfits, or Me First and The Gimmie Gimmies."
4,wonderful yet pop sounding,"I personally love this cd. It is a punk cd with some great emo influence. Every song on this cd is completely unique and completely worthy of listening to. My favorites are any of the songs on the first half of the cd. The only downfall which has been stated in other reviews is that it has this pop sound to it. They give the impression that they are trying to hard to become mainstream. This cd is a must have for any punk fan and would also recommend it to most emo fans. The only caution I have is for those who only listen to underground pure emo music,It may completely turn you off."
4,still good,"i bought this album the day it came out, and after this many years, it's still an awesome record. The lyrics are catchy, and really catch the emotions brought by the singer's vocals and tone. I'm not some little punk kid trying to pump up the record sales, as most of the reviews i see on amazon are, but come on, this band's music is catchy. buy it used it's like 3 bucks.have a good day,-chris-"
5,"I've owned this CD for 10 years now, and it's still awesome.","This album has staying power... ten years worth of staying power. I bought this when I was a kid, and it still rocks my stereo to this day. Pop with a bit of hardcore roots, if you listen closely.Just to clear this up: As of this release, and beyond, NFG is no longer a ""punk"" band. In this release, they are purely pop rock. In later releases, they move into hardcore pop territory on a few songs, but stay in the pop rock category. Don't buy this CD expecting poorly-produced ""authentic"" punk, and you'll probably love it like I do. Preconceptions are everything./RantBest songs: Sucker, Sincerely Me"
1,His voice is annoying,Save your money. I would rather go buy Blink 182's enema of the state (probably the worst album on earth) than this piece of trash. All he does is whine. It gives me a headache. Save your money
1,Yes yes!!! Punk is back! I love punk!! I'm a punk!,"I have rich parents and I live in the suburbs of a very clean mid-west city. My parents bought me a whole lot of expensive guitar equipment and I play punk with it. This is my favorite punk band. Punk is all about being cool and middle-class. My sweet friend Joey Thieman told me about this band, so I bought their CD and boy oh boy, it's so Punk rockin! I mean punk rock has nothing to do with having the slightest thing to say, or trying to break away from any mainstream. No, punk = MTV, and I can't believe I lived without this band! Thank you Joey, whereever you are..."
2,Very overrated,"Wow - I looked at the other reviews and thought that I've got to check out New Found Glory. I did and I'm not impressed. It's pop pablum. There's nothing edgy, nothing new, and very little good about New Found Glory. Get a bunch of guys together who can't sing, can't write music, and play cords really fast to mediocre pop melodies."
4,Who is the terrorist?!!!!!!,Billy is killed by a bomb. His parents felt sad but Laura (His sister) is determined to find out who the terrorist is. Will she find him?
3,hhhhhmmmmmmm,"i also found this book very sterotypical. i knew the terriost was going to end up to be a muslim very early in the story altough i was really hoping by maybe some chance the muslims wouldn't be the ""bad guys"" this time a along.I liked the book and all but I think the book would of been way better is she actually did a bit of research because She apparently has no idea how modern muslims live. Because lots of muslim girls get educated go to college get jobs date and marry guys the want and dont dress head to toe."
3,Difficult book to review,"I read the book in one afternoon but it's taken me over a week to write a review. The story itself is not one of Caroline Cooney's best. The characters are poorly developed and Laura's actions come off as unrealistic for a grieving 16 year old girl. My main issue with the book is the stereotypical portrayal of certain ethnic groups. However, considering it was written in the late 90s, there is a certain foreshadowing of future events and that, in itself, makes it a more worthwhile read. I don't know that I would recommend it but it is an interesting reminder of the world before 9/11.Disclaimer: I was given a copy of the book for my Kindle in exchange for my honest review."
3,The Terrorist Was an Exciting Yet Discrimintive Book,"The Terrorist was an exciting book. But, saying that Muslims are just.... well...bad doesn't say a good thing about the U.S. I thought that this book was, yes, a thriller. But there were a few glitches. Such as, what happens to Jerhan?, How will Laura and her family recover from Billy's death?, and What happens to Laura's best friend? If the author really wants a five star on this book, I think she should write a sequal. (:^)"
5,One Word...Great!,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked this up from the library, but what I found was a surprisingly good story about a girl trying to solve the mystery of her younger brother's murder. The death changes her family's life drastically, and Laura warily tries to find a friend to comfort her as she weeds through suspects and tries to pull her life back together. I found the end unsatisfying, but the story is exciting and may even bring you to tears."
1,This books degrades the islamic religion!,"This book degrades the islamic religion. It makes Muslim's look bad, in the eyes of the people. ..."
3,John,I thought this book was well written and the plot was a good one. The book had a good plot but was kinda a liitle dragging the author could have done it in many different ways. The book is aminly about the sister and finding the killer but i thought that the book got to the point very quickly also i thought the end was terrible it left the readier hanging still needing more info. It needed to tell you what happened in a better way not just saying nothing happened with the terrorist I would reccomend this book but it had a bad ending and got to the point ery quickly which could be good or bad.
5,Great movie,my husband recommended it and this movie was a hit. we both enjoyed watching it on one of our few date nights!
2,Not truly Christian,"Overall I thought this movie was a very good production with an exciting plot and good acting, but I was disappointed with the Christian aspect. The messages (both subtle and not-so-subtle) conveyed in ""Belle and the Beast"" seemed no different from those conveyed by secular romance films: The woman is perfect as she is and does not need to change; she has unrealistically high standards for a partner; she alone holds the power to change a man; in a healthy relationship, the man does all the work and pursues the woman and placates her until she is satisfied. I am not advocating the traditional model of a relationship in which the the man is the head and the woman a mere submissive puppet; I appreciated Belle's confidence and independence. However, after watching this film which explicitly advertises itself as Christian, I felt as if I had sat through just another secular romance that portrays false ideas about true love."
5,Awesome Movie!,"This is an awesome movie! Great for kids, teens, adults...everyone! It is very cute! Has a great message and very clean! That's exactly what I look for in a movie...cleanliness, good message, God-centered! I definitely recommend this movie to anyone! I am so grateful that I bought this movie!"
2,Delicously terrible and amusing!!,"I was channel surfing looking for nothing in particular and stumbled upon this gem!! It's low budget, but there are lots of great low budget movies, and that has nothing to do with how bad the movie is. The writing and dialogue is so deliciously awful and incredibly uncreative. I couldn't believe it lasted two hours, but it certainly did provide a couple hours of laughs. Yeah it has a Christian aspect (I am Christian), but this movie is ridiculous! I give it one star for the movie itself, and another for my amusement."
5,Preaching,"The given technique are excellent, i am sure about it, take my advice. You will learn alot about prepearing and deliver a sermon."
2,Poorly written.,"If Craddock actually preaches the way he writes, then he has no business writing a book about preaching. Although the book is filled with insightful details and does a good job framing the sermon process, the language it is written in is poor. Since when were academics excused from writing clearly and succinctly?"
5,WOW WOW WOW,"I just bought this album out of the blue because my parents used to listen to all the old Les Brown records when I was a kid, and I guess I got a shot of nostalgia. I was blown away! I can't take it out of my car's disc changer. Maybe its just me, but this kind of music just makes ya feel good, and if you're not a big band fan now, you will be after listening to this record."
4,Easy To Follow,This DVD is pretty easy to follow. Sometimes listening to it over and over again (using it 4-5 days a week) can get a bit monotonous but overall it's a good purchase and the price was right!
5,Very versatile workout,I really like the fact that I can choose/mix and match my own segments and make my workouts unique. This allows me to target certain areas and make my workout short or long depending on the time I have that day. This is a great workout tool for me.
4,Religious reflections,"Not being Jewish there were parts of this book that I didn't quite get, but being Christian I know enough Old Testament to fake my way through some of the terms and holidays.This was recommended to me by a Jewish-Catholic friend who was very dear to me through college, and I'm glad I read it. The people in each of her stories had a complexity that is hard to find in shorts.. there was depth attained in paragraphs that would take others pages or chapters to attain. I found some of them to be a little bitter about life or their religion - but I books with angry and/or depressed and/or repressed women have their place too.The characters alone made the book well worth the money, and I'm certianly going to pay attention to her future published works. The last short story had me smiling and giggling at the absurdity of it all.Excellent read!"
4,A great introduction to the art of healing,"Third book I have read by authors and it is well written, easy to follow and an excellent introduction to the art of healing.recommended"
3,Not a great beginner's CD,"This is my first intro to DHC. I am a big fan of groups with intelligent or interesting lyrics (TMBG, Barenaked Ladies, Nerfherder) and used the Amazon recommendation to look into them. I figured this would hit their better songs and let me decide if I want to pursue them further.The problem with a live album is that it is harder to understand the lyrics so I am not sure if I would like a studio album since I am such a lyrics fan. They seem like a fun band with lots of energy and would be a good live show. However, I don't like how they drop the F-bomb a lot.Overall, it is likely a very good album for DHC fans but maybe not a good starter's album."
2,NO! STOP! GO FOR THE GOLD!,"It's not that the songs on this collection are bad, it's just that this album is very weak for a ""Best Of"" collection. Both ""Abba Gold"" and ""ABBA More Gold"" are similarly affordable, and both are much more complete than this Millennium collection.Just off the top of my head, ""Gold"" has ""Lay All Your Love On Me,"" ""Money, Money, Money,"" and ""Voulez Vous."" If you're going to choose between a greatest hits compilation, this ""Millennium"" collection is sadly lacking!"
4,Loved it!!!,I think Abba has such a talent with voice and musical instruments- The sounds of the 70's are fun and airy on this cd and brings back memories of my childhood- The best of Abba really is the best songs they had!!!
2,I would probably buy a different brand...,"This is a heavy duty tool and seems to be cut from similar cloth to the ones the docs might use. Sadly, whoever did the finish work on these did not get the blade sharpening quite right. It crushes as much as cuts (bad). Also, the curve of the blade and length of the cutting surface is actually too long. You want something that cuts somewhat directionally... and this one is almost too big for even large toenails on a large person. Normally cutters like this are really really nice to own -- just maybe not this one specifically."
4,Not at your local Beauty supply or 99 cents store,"I had gone to a Podiatrist for treatment of a fungus and an ingrown toenail, I noticed that she had a better toenail cutter than you would see at the local 99 cent store or Beauty supply so I tried to find it. This cutter did what I needed it to do and it was similar to the one she had. One of my concerns was what happens when it gets dull? I have had it for 6 months and it is still going strong so I do believe I have gotten my money's worth."
3,Print is so cheap and terrible,As if it has been copied a 100 times. I still like the book. The older version was given to me by a close friend and it made such a positive difference in my life. I bought this version for a friend who just returned from the war. He is going to need glasses to read the cheap print. Too bad it was printed so badly.
5,Book offers expanded awareness,This book takes you from the concept of grief to choosing a new path to recovery to moving beyond the loss of a loved one. It is an excellent book for any one in grief. The book offers finding stability in a storm of emotions. This is also a necessary book for the library of all health professionals.
1,A Review of Losses Felt Like Wallowing to Me,"Well written and well meaning but gee, those exercises weren't what I needed. I didn't feel it was exactly helpful to dredge up all the bad hits I've taken over the last 30 years. It looks like the book was so very helpful to some reviewers and that's wonderful. I needed to pick up and get moving not do a life review of all the hurtful losses."
4,A tea set with creativity,"My daughter (7) was begging for a china tea set for Christmas. We got her this because it was not only a china tea set, but there was a ""something to do"" element. She was so excited. It was like getting two gifts in one."
4,"""Grooooove!""","We got our first taste of Farina at Club Velvet in St. Louis earlier this year and was blown away. His mixing skills, vibey track selection and sound tweaking through EQ's are right on. This CD took us right back there. Great job Mark! We're patiently waiting for another release.P.S. Please come back to St. Louis!"
2,"Boring, spacey music","I bought this album because one of the band members is in Sleater-Kinney and the other played with Elliott Smith. Don't expect that level of genius here. This record sounds like a bored guy on a rainy day, playing with his storebought synthesizer. And the lyrics quickly become too cutesy and repetitive to bear: just one fable after another about bad things happening to good teddy bears. Stick to Elliott Smith and you'll be happier."
3,Good WORKOUT CD....,"....that's all I use it for. Although they are vocally gifted and are pleasant to the ear mucally, I would not call it a ""christian"" CD. I read other people's reviews and unfortunatelly all they are impressed with is the band NOT the God that they serve:("
2,Don't waste your money,"Seriously this cd is ... I wouldnt even consider this album punk. It's like Christian pop. the only song that has some punk in it is ""My Girlfriend"" (which is the only reason why this cd has 2 stars). Their new cd is much much much better than this. if you want to get some good Christian punk, check out MxPx, Slick Shoes, the OC Supertones, or Dogwood"
4,Great for A Debut CD,"I've been a fan of Relient K ever since this album, but I'm reminded that this IS their debut CD. It's hard not to do, but you can't really compare this CD to Two Lefts or Mmmhmm because the band has evidently (and naturally) grown and matured as a band. While it's not their ""best"" album, I'd say that, for a debut album, it holds up nicely. I reccommend anything by these guys, especially Mmmhmm!!"
5,catchy pop-punk,"if you read the review from the guy who said to go buy blink182 and not to waste your money don't listen to him. this band is way better than blink. vocals, lyrics, guitars, everything is very catchy. it's clean sounding and fun to listen to all the way through. and the solo on charles in charge is rad. don't waste your money on blink 182. this cd is definately worth it."
3,There is only one good song on it.,"The only reason I bought this CD was for 1 song and that was softer to me. It totaly rocks. But it amazes me that band that made softer to me, can't seem to make another good one. But personaly I like Rock and rock alternative better than punk. If you like Punk then you will like this CD. If you don't like punk then don't get it. If you like the song ""Softer to me"" and you are thinking of buying the CD, only get it if you can get it at a good price like under 5 bucks. Peace."
1,Ashley,"I ordrerd this book on 2nd February 2011, and here I am 9th March waiting to recive my order, so on this one Amazon gets a major low low score"
2,A step backward for Navman,"I've now tried the icn550, replaced by the icn530, and now the n40i. They're all physically similar, with slightly different buttons. Big new hardware feature on the N40 is ""navpix"" (1.3 mpixel camera to associate a picture with the current GPS fix). Personally, I could not care less about that. What's amazing to me is that the map data around my house got WORSE this year (it's got the 2006 maps). Also, I find the user interface even less intuitive than its predecessor the icn-530. I can say at least that it gets a GPS fix pretty quickly. I had to reach for something nice to say. Go with Lowrance or Garmin or something."
1,Wings of Desire is better by far,"""Wings of Desire"" (the movie that ""City of Angels"" is loosely inspired upon), is a masterpiece and ""City of Angels"" is...is... how could I explain it not being too rude? It is just a piece of junk in comparison. Somebody wrote that he didn't like ""Wings of Desire"" because he didn't feel the same as he felt watching ""City of Angels"". I agree in the ""feeling"" part, because I felt nausea watching ""City of Angels"" and that didn't happen to me watching ""Wings of Desire""!! I own ""Wings of Desire"" and have seen it and enjoyed it many times. Regarding ""City of Angels"", well I rented it and barely could see it once!"
3,can we say depressing.........,"this was one of the most touching,outstanding,and would have been one of the best movies if it wasnt for that oh so sad ending.it depressed me greatly thinking that true happiness is not always there.That sometimes for love you go to great lengths for absolutly NOTHING!!!"
3,Hard to swallow,I liked the movie but it was a hard one to swallow. It really makes you think about the way life works.
3,Ending destroys the film.,"This movie was going along great until it came to the end. A wonderful love story that shows what lengths some will go to find true love. I was really enjoying this film, until the end came and destroyed it. I think that whoever made this film found that s/he could not find true love and therefore let's just go and destroy a perfectly good movie and make everyone else miserable like myself. Get this movie and you will be disappointed in the terrible ending."
3,Hmmm...undecided!,"This was a terribly sad movie, it would seem by the plot, however I was not emotionally torn apart, unfortunately. It was a bit slow at points and I did not particularly like a lot of the cinematography in certain scenes. I did find the storyline to be heart-wrenching and Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage acted well, though certainly not Oscar-winning performances. I do love the soundtrack from this movie, so overall, I give it 3 stars."
4,I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS OVER ALL PRETTY GOOD.,THE MOVIE WAS KINDA PREDICTABLE TOWARDS THE ENDING. IT TOTALLY TOOK MY HEART AWAY. THE CASTING WAS GREAT.
3,"Not My Favorite, But OK...","Keep in mind , this is just my opinion, but I just thought it was weird. If you like something slightly unrealistic and kooky, than rent this."
5,Good Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and I thought that both Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage did an excellent job at portraying their characters. It even brought me to tears at the end.....most movies don't do that!
1,nul,"Une pale copie des ailes du désir de Wenders. Un film ennuyeux, sans substance, superficiel. C'est désolant et malgré tout des films comme a sont reálisés tous les jours aux ...Cultivez vous un peu Mr Silbering!"
2,Pale imitation,"This movie is a pale, watered-down imitation of Wim Wenders classic ""Wings of Desire"". See ""Wings"" instead."
4,city of angels,"We have looked for a copy of this movie in retail stores and even preowned copies at video rental establishments. We have found it twice paired with Michael on the same dvd. We own a copy of Michael, so we did not want to pay extra money for the two. We were happy to see there were a couple copies available on Amazon at a reasonable price. It was not much of a gamble for us because we have seen the movie. We were however concerned for the condition of the movie. The case was a little damaged inside and out when we received it, but the disc was in good condition. We enjoyed the movie again and have added it to our collection. Overall, this was a good buying experience from Amazon."
2,very disappointing,"i thought the whole concept of the movie was very good but the treatment was awful. comeon even with those irritating oh so innocent expressions Cage looks nowhere near to an angel. ryan is ok but i've seen her in better movies. if you are expecting a touching, heartwarming love story skip this one."
5,"A heavenly taste of love, joy, sacrifice and sorrow.",What can one say?? No it isn't Wings of Desire...but setting poetic license aside....this is an all round feel good/hanky pic. Dennis Franz and Andre Braugher really give wonderful support to two of the best actors around. It just a fabulous love story...what more can one want??? After all...life does not always have a happy ending...so why expect it in this movie.
4,A truly spectacular movie - tear jerking ending though,This movie had my wife and I riveted but the ending left us both kind of depressed.
5,excellent intermediate book,"this is a great book for the intermediate wood worker who wants to know how to (or be refreshed) on how to do some specific box making techniques. If you are looking for a project-based book, I would recommend something else. However, I enjoyed this book a lot and have learned some cool things from it."
3,Not up to Taunton's level of detail,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. This is a nicely organized book covering a multitude of relevant subjects, but there's very little useful detail in here. I think Taunton made a mistake by trying to stuff too much into too little space. I'm a decent intermediate woodworker and thought this book would help me with some of the things I struggle with in making decorative boxes. But I already knew about 75% of what's in this book. Besides too little detail, the photos, although plentiful, are too small to be of value. Sorry Taunton, a nice effort, but this one misses the mark for me."
2,Addicted 2 Trance,"i was looking for commercial dance music and thats what this cd has but most of these tracks are awful...i do like the ""Milkshake"" remix and Lasgo's ""Alone""."
4,Best of the Colosseum II albums,"This is the first and best of the Colosseum II albums. It is an interesting mix of jazz fusion, blues, and progressive rock. The songs are 4 minutes to 10 minutes long and the CD is almost 42 minutes.Colosseum was a progressive rock band with blues and jazz tendencies. They spun off from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (like Fleetwood Mac). When the group broke up, the drummer, Jon Hiseman created Colosseum II, which was more of a jazz fusion group. This first album is a transition between the old Colosseum and the new Colosseum II.Colosseum II released 3 albums (not including a ""greatest hits"" compilation). The next two albums consisted of shorter jazz fusion tracks, with a little heavy rock influence. The problem with the last 2 albums is that the compositions were fairly repetitious and not very interesting."
5,An excellent practical guide for business practices...,"I have had this book for quite a long time and have read it many times. Each time that I read it I come away with fresh ideas and views on how to apply systems thinking to practical business problems. This book contains a plethora of ideas, views and examples of both good and bad approaches to applying systems thinking to real problems.I think that every systems engineer should have a copy. Probably all project engineers trying to do NPI in today's fast-paced business environment should also have a copy. I think there is lots of very practical advice and ideas in the book.The book covers many aspects of systems thinking in business applications from foundations of cybernetics, psychology and philosophy to hands-on approaches to managing teams.Highly recommended."
5,Loved this book.,I think the message of this book is to be proud of who you are and not wish to be something you are not or wish to be someone else.
3,Very helpful while it lasted,"But it only lasted about three months. Then the battery died, and no one around here would replace it. So that was an expensive mistake.To bad, while it worked, it was pretty helpful."
2,B O R I N G,"As an avid reader of true crime, I must say this book was really boring. I also agree with a fellower reviewer on the writing of the book. This story had more to it then just ""teen gone bad"". I would have loved to read this book if the late great Jack Olsen or Ann Rule had written it. I think the writer failed miserably when she did not give us more background on the killers. She just left it to up to the reader to figure out: Valessa was probably a little girl lost. A child of divorce who felt abandoned by her father, and then again by her mother who seemed to have spent more time with her boyfriend then her children. Did she deserve to die? certainly not however, Valessa having so much time alone, left the door open for drugs and Adam Davis to enter the picture."
2,Dissappointed,"When this unit came out I rushed out to buy it since I own the model S52 that came right before it.I love the S52.It has all the adjustments one would ever need to get a great picture.What a letdown the S53 was.The picture is fair but Panasonic took all the user adjustments off this model.You are stuck with the factory presets like skin,normal,etc.There is no adjustment for gamma on this machine.If you have a scene with alot of black and you can't see the details,you have to either turn up the brightness or live with it.I thought I would be getting the same player as the S52 but with the added joy of upconverting my movies to 1080P.I have just bought a Philips 47"" ambilight 1080P television.This tv has to be seen to be believed.Philips 47PFL7432D 47"" 1080p LCD HDTV with AmbilightThe one thing that I really do like about the S53 over the S52 is the open tray function on the remote.The S52 does not have this feature."
4,Great fun,"When me and my friend went to see this film around May last year, we were the only ones in the cinema laughing. If you're that kind of wacky person (like me) you'll have a wild time."
4,great movie. halarious.,"I love this movie. If you haven't seen it, it is a must if you like bill murray. you won't be dissapointed."
3,Brit Cameo-a-go-go,"Murray plays against type as a good-natured and naive idiot-savant who stumbles through the spy-spoof plot. The story is silly and unbelievable, but Murray always makes his scenes worthwhile, and it's important to remember this is parody.The pacing of the film is quite uneven, the last half hour suddenly pouring on the action and laughs. Extra Entertainment for us Brits is also provided by the many support parts from English celebs, such as Richard ""I don't believe it"" Wilson as a dastardly villain and John ""Fast Show/Fat Bob"" Thompson as a Russian gangster (!)It's not exactly a classic, but Murray's lovable performance and the bizarre nature of the whole thing keeps you intrigued. And it's also got Felix ""Press Gang/Gamesmaster"" Dexter in it, who gets killed in the first twenty minutes (a bonus)."
5,Don't believe the critics,"The other day I was telling my boss how awesome this movie was, so he decided to look online for reviews. Almost every professional reviewer gave some derogatory comment about it. From now on, I'm NEVER going to consult those reviews.This movie is soooo incredibly funny, it ranks among my top ten favs of all time. One thing I can say is that it is imperitive that you pay attention in the beginning, as the rest of the movie hinges on your understanding of the scenario in which Bill Murray finds himself. The plot is naturally ridiculous like any comdedy, but the humor builds on itself, and keeps gettting more and more intense. The ending was a total riot."
5,Funny!!,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I've watched it a lot and I still laugh every time,"
3,Youths Lost in Desert Deserve Their Fate,Short novel (94 pages) about group of troubled youth who get lost in the desert and unwittingly attract their rescuers by hanging their wet clothing on an elephant tree to dry. Lots of angst. Writing is kid level and just average. The tree and title are the only reference to elephants ... no actual elephants in the story.
4,Alternative Folk,"Great cd for those of you folk fans who like a twist. Quiet, moody and slightly eclectic. I was pleasantly surprised. Interesting lyrics, good songwriting, and vocals that are pleasing to the ear. A great cd for any collection."
3,could be better,"Floridian Sam Beam, mastermind behind Iron and Wine, explores love, religion and the South throughout the 12 laid-back tracks making up Our Endless Numbered Days. While nicely layered with beautiful string arrangements, the album seems stuck, going nowhere from start to finish.Each song on Our Endless Numbered Days follows the formula of soft, breathy vocals on top of breezy acoustic banjos and guitars. While cool at first, the album soon becomes monotonous. Waiting for an explosion of sound that never comes, coming across Iron and Wine is a frustrating experience of wanting more.Listening to Our Endless Numbered Days is like listening to your hippie friend with an acoustic guitar: cool while passing a joint on the back porch but not made for extended play."
2,Boring,"I like folk music. All kinds. Joni Mitchell, Greg Brown, Ani DiFranco, Nick Drake, Gillian Welch. This music, on the other, is just monotonous. It could benefit from some crescendos, variation in tempo, or something for God's sake. When it's playing, it's sort of just background music. It drones on and on, and eventually I get distracted and forget that it is there. I'd suggest Superwolf by Matt Sweeny and Bonnie Prince Billy instead."
3,ordinary stuff,"This was the first Iron & Wine album that I bought. I had heard a couple of single tracks, and read the glowing reviews, so I was intrigued. But honestly, I don't see/hear what all the fuss is about. The bottom line; I'm simply not moved by most of these songs. It's all quite listenable, but I don't feel compelled to play this CD very often."
5,A good solid read on the Laws of 1770's & when they deemed life started...,"I'm not a relative, Just a history buff of many years. This is great local history. From a bigger stand point tho, it dives, head first, into the Founders idea's of when life states in their eyes... I got me thinking of the HUGE abortion issue that has been in the US for years... What did our Founding Fathers thing? Well this answers all that with a good murder mystery... Well worth the read even if our not a history buff..."
3,Murdered By His Wife,"I found this interesting in that Bathsheba is a relative, however I found it a bit repetitive in the telling."
4,Memory Lane,You just cant hardly beat the sound of BTO. Brings back a simplier time in life. Great Sound.
4,The Best of Bachman Turner Overdrive,This album brought back some pleasant memories from the past when I started to here some of the tracks that I had not heard for many years. A terrific 70's rock album!
